1
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,924
This global warming is killing me.

2
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:17,970
This is too hot, the lce Age was too cold.

3
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,098
What would it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:24,768
This l like.

5
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,763
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

6
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,106
No running, James. Camp rules.

7
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:15,360
Make me, sloth.

8
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,822
Make me, sir. lt's all about respect.

9
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,492
Water ball.

10
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:27,539
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.
Hector, no, no, no, you can't pee-pee there.

11
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,542
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...

12
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,169
Pinata!

13
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,505
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.

14
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:37,507
OK.

15
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:40,218
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
- Mine.

16
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:42,262
- Mine.
- Mine.

17
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:50,395
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

18
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:52,856
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

19
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,780
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?

20
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,658
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

21
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:07,620
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammals-jammals.

22
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,873
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

23
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:16,170
Look, l opened my camp.
''Campo del Sid.'' lt means Camp of Sid.

24
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,133
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.

25
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:24,887
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?

26
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,223
Don't make me eat you.

27
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:30,518
They kid. That's why they're called kids.

28
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:34,397
l told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.

29
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:37,233
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?

30
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:41,946
Besides, these kids look up to me.
l'm a role model to them.

31
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,741
l can see that.

32
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:50,288
You guys never think l can do anything,
but l'm an equal member of this herd.

33
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:56,168
l made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

34
00:05:57,712 --> 00:06:01,132
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

35
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:05,761
- Hey, let's play pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth.
- Yeah!

36
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,722
Sid!

37
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,807
l can do stuff.

38
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,978
Won't give me their stupid respect.

39
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,108
l'll show 'em.

40
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:25,990
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.

41
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,076
And they lived happily ever after.

42
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:34,123
- Good job.
- Question.

43
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:37,668
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

44
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:41,630
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.

45
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,050
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.

46
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,762
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.

47
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:52,766
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.

48
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:57,646
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.

49
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:01,692
See, that's why l called it a burro.

50
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:06,697
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.

51
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:09,324
- Boring.
- lt's not believable.

52
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,952
- Do burros eat their young?
- lt's not a good ending.

53
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:14,329
Sometimes l throw up.

54
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:19,501
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

55
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:23,505
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

56
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:26,258
Where's your big, happy family?

57
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:35,350
Then the hungry tiger ate the pesky little kids.

58
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,729
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

59
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,357
- l thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

60
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,735
- Run for your lives!
- Where's everybody going?

61
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:48,905
- The world's coming to an end.
- What are you talking about?

62
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:52,242
Fast Tony - he says the world's gonna flood.

63
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:55,078
Folks, l hold in my hand a device so powerful,

64
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:58,581
- it can actually pull air right out of the sky.
- Yeah, right.

65
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,084
Gather round, gather round.

66
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:03,628
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?

67
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:06,256
So you can't breathe underwater?

68
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:08,675
My assistant here will demonstrate.

69
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:11,261
Hey, l can smell the ocean.

70
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:14,597
What are you doing? l can't sell that now.

71
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:17,559
You suck air through your mouth, you moron.

72
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:24,107
Through its design and sturdy construction,
you'll have plenty of air for eons to come.

73
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:26,693
Of course, results may vary.

74
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:30,780
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

75
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,783
l'm trying to make a living here, pal.

76
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:39,330
lt's my weather forecast. The five-day outlook
calls for intense flooding

77
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,041
followed by the end of the world.

78
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:45,920
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.

79
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,800
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.

80
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,471
Are you making an offer?
l mean, no, l would not.

81
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:58,057
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.

82
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:00,476
You see this ground, it's covered in ice.

83
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,979
A thousand years ago, it was covered in ice.

84
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,815
A thousand years from now, it will still be ice.

85
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:10,236
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,

86
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:13,614
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

87
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:17,785
- What are you talking about?
- About you being the last of your kind.

88
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,746
Your breath smells like ants.

89
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:28,295
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?

90
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,298
Don't pay any attention to him.

91
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:34,343
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

92
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:38,847
- What about the dinosaurs?
- The dinosaurs got cocky and made enemies.

93
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:42,184
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

94
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:45,354
Please tell me that's not our idiot.

95
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:50,776
OK, l'm gonnajump on the count of three.

96
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:53,862
One,

97
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:55,739
two...

98
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:59,326
Sid, don't move a muscle. We're coming up.

99
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:01,120
Jump! Jump! Jump!

100
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:03,372
Jump! Jump! Jump!

101
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:04,957
Sorry.

102
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:08,794
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

103
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:11,547
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

104
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:14,550
No. l'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

105
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,053
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

106
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:21,265
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.

107
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:24,393
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

108
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,897
- But l've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

109
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,361
Hey, watch it.

110
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:45,372
l can't breathe.
l think l just coughed up my spleen.

111
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:04,391
- Diego, retract the claws, please.
- Right. Sorry.

112
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:08,895
lf l didn't know you better, Diego,
l'd think you were afraid of the water.

113
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:11,523
OK, OK. Good thing l know you better.

114
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:13,233
Guys.

115
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,485
Fast Tony was right.

116
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:19,239
Everything is melting.

117
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:48,184
lt's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

118
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:51,187
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.

119
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:55,483
- That's genius, Sid.
- Call me Squid.

120
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:02,281
This whole thing's a piece ofjunk.
l can't believe l live here.

121
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:05,117
What?

122
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:15,795
Forget reeds. l present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.

123
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:21,300
- lt's so buoyant, it actually floats.
- l'll show you something that floats.

124
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:24,387
All right, it's your funeral.

125
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,649
See? This is exactly what l'm talking about.

126
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,694
Giants balls of furry lava
the size of mammoths raining from the sky.

127
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,530
Go suck air through a reed.

128
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:49,203
- Listen to him. He's right about the flood.
- l am? l mean, yes, l am.

129
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:53,874
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?

130
00:12:53,874 --> 00:13:00,130
Because we saw what's up there. The dam's
gonna break. The entire valley's gonna flood.

131
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:06,220
Flood's real, all right. And it's coming fast.

132
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,389
Look around. You're in a bowl.

133
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:14,686
Bowl's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

134
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:20,359
- What are we gonna do?
- Unless you make it to the end of the valley.

135
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:23,195
There's a boat. lt can save you.

136
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:26,239
- l don't see anything.
- But

137
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,617
y'all better hurry.

138
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:33,246
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.

139
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,375
Survive that and you'll be racing the water,

140
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,754
'cause in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.

141
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,839
Boom!

142
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,510
There is some good news, though.

143
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,637
The more of you die,

144
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:50,722
the better l eat.

145
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:55,560
l didn't say it was good news for you.

146
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,525
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class.

147
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,092
Dam.

148
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:32,972
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.

149
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,558
Manny, you really think there's a boat?

150
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:39,270
l don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.

151
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,398
lf there's any hope, it's that way.

152
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,213
Manny, let's go.

153
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:31,489
Overturned glyptodont in the far right lane.
Traffic backed up as far as the eye can see.

154
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:35,076
And it looks like there might be a fatality.

155
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:37,161
l call the dark meat.

156
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:43,501
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

157
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,796
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

158
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:54,053
Well, l'm not leaving.
l was born in this hole and l'll die in this hole.

159
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:03,395
Do we have to bring this crap?

160
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:08,817
- l'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

161
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,944
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

162
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:13,822
Manny, l just heard you're going extinct.

163
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:17,868
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

164
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:23,540
- l'm not going extinct.
- Kids, look. The last mammoth.

165
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,545
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.

166
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:29,796
See?

167
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:33,634
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

168
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:14,424
Stu. Come on, Stu.

169
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:17,302
Let's blow this ice-cube stand.

170
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,346
Stu.

171
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:31,357
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.

172
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:47,284
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

173
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:54,708
Stop singing, Sid.

174
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:03,508
Sid, l'm going to fall on you again
and this time l will kill you.

175
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:06,845
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.

176
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,607
What if you're right?

177
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,651
What if l am the last mammoth?

178
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:25,030
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.

179
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,616
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

180
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:35,248
- Mammoths?
- l knew l couldn't be the last one.

181
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:37,834
l felt it in my gut.

182
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,514
Extinct? Come on.

183
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:58,146
He's up by a couple of fifths, ahead by a tusk.

184
00:20:58,187 --> 00:21:02,275
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

185
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:13,035
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

186
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:19,458
Well, don't that put the ''stink'' in extinction?

187
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:23,087
Nasty.

188
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,924
Manny.

189
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:31,345
l need to be alone for a while.

190
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:34,265
You go on ahead. l'll catch up.

191
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:44,150
One truly is the loneliest number.

192
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,905
These work great.

193
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:52,616
Cool.

194
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:57,663
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- l'll get 'em.

195
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:01,917
- Which end is up?
- l'd hide that face too.

196
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:05,879
- Hey, ugly.
- l gotta sit on that.

197
00:22:10,384 --> 00:22:12,052
Gotcha.

198
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:20,728
OK, l'm going in.

199
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,939
- Sid.
- What?

200
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:25,774
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

201
00:22:25,774 --> 00:22:28,819
- l felt some breeze in that one.
- Smile.

202
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:36,118
- Out of my way.
- Hello.

203
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:38,662
Over here.

204
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:42,082
- Surrender?
- Never.

205
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:43,834
Cool.

206
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:45,961
Smoke them.

207
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:58,140
lf anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em
and they were rattlesnakes.

208
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,768
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

209
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:04,312
Miscreants?

210
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:06,731
Diego, they're possums.

211
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:12,153
Retreat.

212
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:40,765
l guess it's just you and me now.

213
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:55,530
l knew it. l knew l wasn't the only one.

214
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,826
Everyone falls out of the tree now and then.
They just don't admit it.

215
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:01,452
Wait. What?

216
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:04,205
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.

217
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:08,376
lt's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

218
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:12,713
And you were in the tree because...?

219
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:16,175
l was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.

220
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:18,803
Brothers? You mean there's more?

221
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,888
Sure.

222
00:24:21,597 --> 00:24:23,766
- There's lots of us.
- Where?

223
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:27,979
Everywhere.
Under rocks. ln holes in the ground.

224
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:31,232
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

225
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,526
Help! Help!

226
00:24:33,526 --> 00:24:35,569
Help!

227
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,203
Well, shave me down and call me a mole rat.
You found another mammoth.

228
00:24:44,203 --> 00:24:48,040
Where? Wait a minute.
l thought mammoths were extinct.

229
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:54,380
- What are you looking at me for?
- l don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

230
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:59,009
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
l'm not a mammoth. l'm a possum.

231
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:03,097
Right. Good one. l'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

232
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:05,224
And my other friend, the platypus.

233
00:25:05,224 --> 00:25:08,936
Why do l gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.

234
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:12,356
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

235
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:17,611
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

236
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:22,783
l don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.

237
00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:26,995
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

238
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:29,289
Hey, she should come with us.

239
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,959
Are you insane? No way.

240
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,585
OK.

241
00:25:33,627 --> 00:25:37,756
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

242
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:41,301
- l'd rather be road kill.
- That can be arranged.

243
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:45,973
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.

244
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:49,059
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

245
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,437
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.

246
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:57,067
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

247
00:25:58,193 --> 00:25:59,861
Why did you invite them?

248
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:03,198
'Cause you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.

249
00:26:03,198 --> 00:26:07,619
- He has a point.
- Sorry, when did l join this dating service?

250
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:11,915
My brothers and l
would be delighted to come with you.

251
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:14,292
lf you treat us nicely.

252
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:17,003
See that? That's the total opposite of nice.

253
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:19,714
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.

254
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:22,968
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

255
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:24,844
Banzai!

256
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:27,347
- l got 'em.
- Back! Back!

257
00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:33,395
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

258
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,821
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now traveling together.

259
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:46,616
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.

260
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:49,536
l'll be the daddy, Ellie will be the mommy.

261
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:53,540
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

262
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,502
Now, let's move it before the ground falls out
from under our feet.

263
00:26:57,544 --> 00:27:00,505
l thought fat guys were supposed to be jolly.

264
00:27:00,546 --> 00:27:04,801
l'm not fat. lt's this fur, it makes me look big.

265
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:07,804
- lt's poofy.
- OK.

266
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:10,056
He's fat.

267
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:48,386
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

268
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:51,347
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

269
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,560
You, ma'am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.

270
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,605
How would you like to lose a ton or two?

271
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:01,273
Would l ever.

272
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:06,111
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.

273
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:11,450
l also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.

274
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:42,606
We'll never make it at this pace.

275
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:47,152
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.

276
00:28:47,152 --> 00:28:50,155
OK. Safe? Please.

277
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:52,282
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

278
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:54,534
- What you got?
- Perimeter all clear.

279
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:59,581
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

280
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:01,541
- Guys.
- All clear.

281
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,841
Hawk!

282
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:20,602
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

283
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:24,981
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because l'm a mammoth.

284
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:27,442
But you'd do it for treats, right?

285
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:30,570
ls he gone?

286
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:34,950
You're safe. Get up.

287
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,118
Man.

288
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,664
lf you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.

289
00:29:41,664 --> 00:29:44,417
That's how cousin Wilton went.

290
00:29:47,462 --> 00:29:49,839
Boy, l really feel for you. l do.

291
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,219
l can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.

292
00:29:54,219 --> 00:29:58,723
- l'm not the last one.
- You brave, brave soul.

293
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:01,851
That's right. Don't give up hope.

294
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:05,396
Ellie.

295
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:08,316
Look at our footprints.

296
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:10,652
They're the same shape.

297
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:13,863
Well, how do l know
those aren't your footprints?

298
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:16,032
Well, then,

299
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:18,409
look at our shadows.

300
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:20,745
We match.

301
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:23,539
You're right. They're the same.

302
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,792
You must be part possum.

303
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,963
You wish.

304
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:47,271
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.

305
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:50,358
We gotta catch up with the others.

306
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:01,035
Hey. Knock it off.

307
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:07,333
Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

308
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,586
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

309
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:12,838
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

310
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:18,969
but it's strong enough to hold
a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

311
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,118
Mammal overboard!

312
00:31:57,341 --> 00:32:01,178
Ellie, get up. lf you play dead, you'll be dead.

313
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:03,305
Look at me.

314
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,813
Diego.

315
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,239
Diego.

316
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:33,001
Come on, Diego. Come on.

317
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:37,297
This may sting a little.

318
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:45,156
- What in the animal kingdom was that?
- l don't know.

319
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,201
From now on, land - safe, water - not safe.

320
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:58,085
That was the bravest thing l've ever seen.

321
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:01,088
- lt was nothing. l...
- lt's not a compliment.

322
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,215
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

323
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:06,260
- Yeah, we're spineless.
- Lily-livered.

324
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,764
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

325
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:12,808
Maybe you should run away more.

326
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:15,227
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

327
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:17,313
Happy to help.

328
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:22,735
Do you believe her? ''Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more.''

329
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:25,946
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

330
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:28,282
You like her.

331
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:32,870
- l do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

332
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,622
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

333
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:38,459
You know, the one where you can't swim.

334
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:42,296
- That's ridiculous.
- Fine. But we're living in a melting world.

335
00:34:42,337 --> 00:34:47,009
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.

336
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:48,403
Almost there.

337
00:35:49,195 --> 00:35:51,698
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

338
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,742
Let's roll.

339
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:58,329
Wait for me.

340
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:12,802
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

341
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,805
So you think she's the girl for me?

342
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:19,058
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

343
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:21,769
She completes you.

344
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:25,440
Yeah.

345
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,819
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

346
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:32,238
- No.
- Come on.

347
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:36,451
- You expect to impress with that attitude?
- l don't want to impress.

348
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:39,412
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

349
00:36:39,412 --> 00:36:43,166
Because that's what she is.
l don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

350
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:47,587
- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.

351
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:50,381
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.

352
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:56,637
He's never gonna let up on you.
lt'll be easier on all of us if you just go with it.

353
00:36:58,014 --> 00:37:02,935
- So what do you want me to do?
- Pull the tree and shoot me into the pond.

354
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:07,523
- l don't know.
- lf you're too lame to do it, we can get Ellie.

355
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:10,401
No, no, no. No, l can do it. l can do it.

356
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:12,445
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

357
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:16,282
- Have you done this before?
- Only a million times.

358
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:18,826
Farther, farther, farther.

359
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,829
Perfect. Fire!

360
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:26,375
Yeah! l can fly!

361
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,055
Crash!

362
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:44,476
Crash! Crash!

363
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:47,146
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

364
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:50,190
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

365
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,652
- He said he could do it.
- And you listened to him?

366
00:37:53,694 --> 00:37:57,114
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.

367
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:59,366
Can l help in any way here?

368
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:02,452
You've done enough.

369
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,332
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't leave me.

370
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:09,793
Who's gonna watch my back?

371
00:38:09,793 --> 00:38:13,463
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

372
00:38:13,463 --> 00:38:17,801
Who's gonna roll in that dung patch with me?

373
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:19,845
Dung patch?

374
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:24,683
- Wait. My legs. l can stand.
- He can stand.

375
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:28,478
- l can run.
- He can run. lt's a miracle.

376
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,564
Hallelujah!

377
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:41,867
What can l say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.

378
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:45,161
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

379
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:47,414
Not the face.

380
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:00,427
Ellie, Ellie, me too.

381
00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:02,679
She's not half bad.

382
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:07,434
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

383
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:09,519
So?

384
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:13,565
So what's holding you back?

385
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,944
My family.

386
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:24,075
You can have that again, you know.

387
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:26,369
No, Sid, l can't.

388
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:31,165
OK, OK, but think about it.
l mean, if you let this chance go,

389
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:36,421
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that's just selfish.

390
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,347
l think l'm starting to get through to him.

391
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:50,560
- Wait, wait. l got you.
- Slowpoke.

392
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:58,442
- Need help?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

393
00:39:58,484 --> 00:40:01,237
- You're stuck.
- l am not.

394
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:03,990
All right, then, let's go.

395
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,284
l can't.

396
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,620
l'm stuck.

397
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,417
Don't you think that
picking them up like this would be easier?

398
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,518
Ellie?

399
00:40:55,165 --> 00:40:57,459
l know this place.

400
00:43:01,249 --> 00:43:05,419
You know, deep down, l knew l was different.

401
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:12,051
l was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.

402
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:14,637
OK, a lot bigger.

403
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:20,434
Now l understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.

404
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:26,440
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

405
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,901
- you know.
- What?

406
00:43:34,063 --> 00:43:35,856
Attractive.

407
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:39,026
- Really?
- Sure.

408
00:43:39,026 --> 00:43:42,404
What about me is attractive?

409
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:46,492
l don't know.

410
00:43:46,492 --> 00:43:48,827
Well, there's your

411
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:52,373
butt.

412
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,542
What about it?

413
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,711
lt's

414
00:43:57,753 --> 00:44:00,047
big.

415
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:02,299
You're just saying that.

416
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:05,844
No, no, no, l mean it.

417
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:10,224
lt's huge. Biggest darn butt l've ever seen.

418
00:44:10,224 --> 00:44:13,227
That is really sweet.

419
00:44:13,227 --> 00:44:15,562
What a crazy day.

420
00:44:15,604 --> 00:44:21,109
This morning l woke up a possum
and now l'm a mammoth.

421
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,759
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.

422
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:12,178
Sure did.

423
00:46:12,178 --> 00:46:17,099
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.

424
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:20,644
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

425
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,939
l wouldn't know. Sabers don't feel fear.

426
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:28,569
Come on, all animals feel fear.
lt's what separates us from, say, rocks.

427
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:31,155
Rocks have no fear.

428
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,742
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

429
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:39,663
lt may surprise you to know
that l, too, have experienced fear.

430
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,582
No. You?

431
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:44,168
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,

432
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:49,965
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise ''kill'' us.

433
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:52,801
- l wonder why?
- Jealousy, mostly.

434
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:55,888
But the point is that fear is natural.

435
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:59,516
Fear is for prey.

436
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:03,312
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.

437
00:47:03,312 --> 00:47:07,316
Justjump in and trust your instincts.

438
00:47:07,316 --> 00:47:10,110
You know, most animals can swim as babies.

439
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:16,366
And for a tiger, it's like
crawling on your belly to stalk helpless prey.

440
00:47:16,825 --> 00:47:21,330
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.

441
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,458
l'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.

442
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:27,461
l look back over my shoulder
to see if l'm being followed.

443
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:29,838
And l'm breathing.

444
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,425
And l'm stalking and l'm stalking and l'm...

445
00:47:34,676 --> 00:47:39,181
- l'm falling.
- Correction. You're sinking.

446
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:41,808
Kind of like a rock.

447
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,357
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?

448
00:47:49,357 --> 00:47:52,527
Or do we just throw our weight around?

449
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:54,362
Whoops. Sorry.

450
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:57,032
l don't know my own strength yet.

451
00:47:57,032 --> 00:48:01,494
Ellie, do you realize that now
we have a chance to save our species?

452
00:48:01,494 --> 00:48:06,207
- Really? How are we gonna do that?
- Well, you know...

453
00:48:06,207 --> 00:48:08,209
Did you just...?

454
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:12,088
l'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

455
00:48:12,088 --> 00:48:15,884
l wasn't saying... Not right now. ln time.

456
00:48:15,884 --> 00:48:20,013
- l was just saying that it's our responsibility.
- What?

457
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:22,891
All right, that came out wrong. l...

458
00:48:22,891 --> 00:48:25,059
You're very pretty, but we just met...

459
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:28,521
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? ls that it?

460
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:32,609
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.

461
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:38,615
l got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

462
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:52,378
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

463
00:48:57,425 --> 00:49:02,930
OK, let's go. We traveled with you all day,
now you're coming with us at night.

464
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,141
But we can't see at night.

465
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:07,435
Then enjoy the flood.

466
00:49:07,435 --> 00:49:10,229
l can't even look at him.

467
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:12,315
Pervert.

468
00:49:16,944 --> 00:49:22,158
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

469
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:49,476
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

470
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,731
l thought we could walk together.

471
00:49:53,731 --> 00:49:56,442
Crash, ask the mammoth why he thinks that.

472
00:49:56,442 --> 00:49:59,820
She said she thinks you're ajerk
and to go away.

473
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,864
She didn't say...

474
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,826
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

475
00:50:05,826 --> 00:50:09,913
Tell him that l need
a little personal space right now.

476
00:50:09,913 --> 00:50:14,877
- She said go jump in a lake.
- And possums rule.

477
00:50:14,877 --> 00:50:18,130
- l can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medal?

478
00:50:29,683 --> 00:50:31,935
Stop moving.

479
00:50:35,105 --> 00:50:37,107
Thank you.

480
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,908
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.

481
00:50:49,661 --> 00:50:51,788
Now!

482
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:59,838
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.

483
00:51:05,051 --> 00:51:08,722
- Funny. Now what's your real plan?
- Just do it.

484
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:10,849
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

485
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:13,268
- Bye, Ellie.
- Go now.

486
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:21,401
l'm sorry if what l said before offended you.

487
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:24,028
What do you mean ''if" it offended me?

488
00:51:25,238 --> 00:51:27,740
That it offended her!

489
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,660
l mean that, that it offended you.

490
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:37,208
- You just overreacted, that's all.
- What?

491
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:40,128
- Take it back.
- There are other lives at stake here.

492
00:51:40,128 --> 00:51:42,547
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

493
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:45,466
- lt was a misunderstanding.
- lt was insensitive.

494
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:48,386
- Apologize.
- Why me? She overreacted.

495
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:50,763
- Just apologize.
- No.

496
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:53,766
- Do it.
- OK, l'm sorry.

497
00:51:53,766 --> 00:51:55,226
What?

498
00:51:55,268 --> 00:51:57,854
- He's right. l overreacted.
- You mean...

499
00:51:57,854 --> 00:52:02,608
Not another word or l'll come down there
and push you over myself.

500
00:52:03,192 --> 00:52:05,778
l got it. l got it.

501
00:52:05,778 --> 00:52:07,864
l got it.

502
00:52:13,744 --> 00:52:16,080
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!

503
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:32,471
l guess we finally
did something right together.

504
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:37,643
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.

505
00:52:57,496 --> 00:53:00,666
- Remember the good old days?
- Which good old days?

506
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:04,211
You know. Yesterday, last week.

507
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:09,758
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

508
00:53:09,758 --> 00:53:12,428
Yep. Those were the good days.

509
00:53:12,428 --> 00:53:17,015
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

510
00:53:17,015 --> 00:53:19,518
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

511
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:24,690
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.

512
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,683
Wait a minute.

513
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:44,269
Can l help you?

514
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:57,949
Now, that's what l call respect.

515
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:01,452
Nice.

516
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:10,670
Somebody here likes Sid.

517
00:55:11,129 --> 00:55:15,258
Who is your decorator?
l mean, this is fabulous.

518
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:22,932
Fire King.

519
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:34,735
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognized my true potential.

520
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:36,988
Let there be fire.

521
00:56:46,598 --> 00:56:49,559
lf only the guys could see me now.

522
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:54,481
This is either really good or really bad.

523
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:57,567
No, no, no.

524
00:56:57,567 --> 00:57:03,615
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King? A thousand
years' bad juju for killing Fire King.

525
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:06,743
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

526
00:57:06,743 --> 00:57:09,204
melting ice built up over thousands of years.

527
00:57:09,204 --> 00:57:13,375
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.

528
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,086
We have one - sacrifice the Fire King.

529
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:19,172
- Well, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

530
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:21,967
No! No!

531
00:57:37,941 --> 00:57:40,443
Bad juju!

532
00:58:01,756 --> 00:58:04,133
Water? Water!

533
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:15,478
- Crash, l told you not to drink before bed.
- l didn't do this. At least, not all of it.

534
00:58:15,478 --> 00:58:18,981
- What's happening?
- We overslept. We need to move.

535
00:58:18,981 --> 00:58:23,653
What if we're the last creatures left alive?
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.

536
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:27,114
How? Everyone's either a dude or our sister.

537
00:58:27,949 --> 00:58:30,826
Hi. Hey, Manny.

538
00:58:30,826 --> 00:58:33,871
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.

539
00:58:33,871 --> 00:58:36,457
You were sleepwalking.

540
00:58:36,457 --> 00:58:40,127
No, no, no.
l was kidnapped by a tribe of mini sloths.

541
00:58:40,127 --> 00:58:43,464
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

542
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:47,843
l mean, sure, they tossed me into
a flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

543
00:58:47,843 --> 00:58:51,889
You were dreaming. Come on,
the water's rising faster than we're moving.

544
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:57,144
l'm telling you, l was kidnapped.
l was worshiped. Guys.

545
00:58:57,144 --> 00:58:59,230
Fine.

546
00:59:05,945 --> 00:59:10,032
Can we slow down a little? l'm dying here.

547
00:59:13,911 --> 00:59:16,497
lt was just a figure of speech.

548
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:25,297
They just sit there, watching us.

549
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:28,300
l wish l knew what they were thinking.

550
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:04,395
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

551
01:01:09,817 --> 01:01:12,820
- Sid!
- What? lt's catchy.

552
01:01:25,124 --> 01:01:28,920
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

553
01:01:54,862 --> 01:01:59,366
lt's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?

554
01:02:05,748 --> 01:02:09,835
l just did something involuntary and messy.

555
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:12,755
OK, come on.

556
01:02:13,714 --> 01:02:16,550
Manny. Get back. lt's a minefield out there.

557
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:19,553
There's only one way to go. Straight through.

558
01:02:19,553 --> 01:02:23,599
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

559
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,977
- We'll head back and go around.
- There's no time.

560
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:29,730
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.

561
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,232
lf we go through this, we get blown to bits.

562
01:02:32,232 --> 01:02:34,234
- We go forward.
- We go back.

563
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:36,862
- Forward.
- Back.

564
01:02:36,862 --> 01:02:39,198
- Can l say something?
- No.

565
01:02:39,198 --> 01:02:44,119
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- Well, l guess that proves it.

566
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:46,205
l am a mammoth.

567
01:02:47,706 --> 01:02:51,043
- Come on.
- Fine.

568
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:54,463
l don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.

569
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,258
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.

570
01:03:08,727 --> 01:03:11,938
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.

571
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:13,774
Manny.

572
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,507
Kids, look, the last mammoth.

573
01:03:39,507 --> 01:03:41,968
l just heard you're going extinct.

574
01:03:41,968 --> 01:03:45,638
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're ajerk.

575
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:48,475
Where's your big, happy family?

576
01:03:48,475 --> 01:03:51,144
What's wrong with you?

577
01:03:51,144 --> 01:03:53,646
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

578
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,363
That way.

579
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:48,242
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.

580
01:04:52,163 --> 01:04:54,206
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

581
01:04:54,206 --> 01:04:56,417
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.

582
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:59,670
Possum? About 11 foot tall?

583
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:04,717
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- l sure have. Big as life.

584
01:05:04,717 --> 01:05:06,886
- Where?
- l'm looking at him.

585
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:09,221
Not me.

586
01:05:09,221 --> 01:05:11,473
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

587
01:06:10,949 --> 01:06:15,996
- l don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's already on board.

588
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,886
Hurry, this way. Come on.

589
01:06:33,096 --> 01:06:36,891
- There it is.
- Ellie! Help!

590
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,194
Come on, come on, run!

591
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:56,202
Push.

592
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:02,333
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not leaving you.

593
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,878
- l'm not asking.
- Ellie, no.

594
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:10,174
Ellie, don't worry. We're going for help.

595
01:07:10,174 --> 01:07:12,051
Stay here.

596
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:30,528
- Help us.
- Help! Somebody help.

597
01:07:30,528 --> 01:07:32,655
Manny.

598
01:07:32,822 --> 01:07:35,074
Manny.

599
01:07:38,703 --> 01:07:41,998
- Manny.
- lt's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.

600
01:08:42,307 --> 01:08:44,059
Ellie.

601
01:08:44,059 --> 01:08:46,145
Manny.

602
01:08:49,106 --> 01:08:52,734
- Help!
- l'll save you.

603
01:08:56,989 --> 01:08:59,408
Great. Who's gonna save him?

604
01:09:01,952 --> 01:09:04,121
You really need to brush.

605
01:09:09,293 --> 01:09:13,130
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

606
01:09:14,297 --> 01:09:16,842
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.

607
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:20,846
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

608
01:09:20,846 --> 01:09:23,306
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

609
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:25,517
l am not your prey. l am not your prey.

610
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:28,019
l am not your prey.

611
01:09:50,959 --> 01:09:53,545
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.

612
01:09:53,545 --> 01:09:57,215
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it. Come on.

613
01:09:57,215 --> 01:10:01,302
Claw, kick, claw, kick.

614
01:10:01,302 --> 01:10:04,556
Hey. l'm stalking the prey.

615
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:12,397
Eddie.

616
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:30,039
You did it, buddy. You kicked water's butt.

617
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:33,543
Nothing to it.
Most animals can swim as babies, you know.

618
01:10:33,543 --> 01:10:36,921
Yeah, but not tigers. l left that part out.

619
01:10:52,061 --> 01:10:55,106
There he is.

620
01:10:55,106 --> 01:10:57,608
Ellie, hold on to me.

621
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:31,934
Manny, Manny, behind you.

622
01:12:08,845 --> 01:12:10,931
There they are.

623
01:12:11,932 --> 01:12:14,101
They made it.

624
01:12:24,486 --> 01:12:27,697
We thought we'd never see you again.

625
01:12:36,873 --> 01:12:39,125
We're gonna live.

626
01:12:42,712 --> 01:12:45,757
We're gonna die.

627
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:44,291
- Well, l'm not leaving.
- Grandpa, let go of the boat. The flood's over.

628
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:49,338
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

629
01:14:49,338 --> 01:14:53,509
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.

630
01:14:53,509 --> 01:14:55,928
Well, l am anyway.

631
01:14:58,305 --> 01:15:01,350
l'm thinking about starting a swim school.

632
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:03,894
Sid's Squids.

633
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:11,985
All hail Fire King.

634
01:15:17,115 --> 01:15:18,951
Hi.

635
01:15:22,954 --> 01:15:28,877
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.

636
01:15:31,922 --> 01:15:36,176
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.

637
01:15:36,176 --> 01:15:41,973
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

638
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:49,022
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.

639
01:15:49,648 --> 01:15:55,528
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

640
01:15:55,528 --> 01:15:59,240
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

641
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,327
That doesn't mean ''want to touch.''

642
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:10,043
Don't ask.

643
01:17:10,269 --> 01:17:13,522
We're not the last ones anymore.

644
01:17:18,277 --> 01:17:20,404
You're not coming?

645
01:17:20,404 --> 01:17:22,740
You wanna go with them?

646
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,950
l am a mammoth.

647
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,661
l should probably be with a mammoth.

648
01:17:27,661 --> 01:17:30,247
Don't you think?

649
01:17:30,247 --> 01:17:32,333
Yeah, unless...

650
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:36,170
Unless?

651
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:40,049
Unless l...

652
01:17:42,426 --> 01:17:45,387
l just wanna say...

653
01:17:46,138 --> 01:17:48,599
l need to tell you...

654
01:17:50,309 --> 01:17:54,396
l hope you find everything you're looking for.

655
01:17:57,608 --> 01:17:59,693
You too.

656
01:18:33,935 --> 01:18:39,858
Manny, you've come a long way since we met
and l'll take full credit for that,

657
01:18:39,858 --> 01:18:45,071
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.

658
01:18:48,909 --> 01:18:51,995
- Go after her.
- lt's OK.

659
01:18:52,787 --> 01:18:55,165
We'll always be here for you.

660
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:59,711
- l'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.

661
01:18:59,711 --> 01:19:02,505
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.

662
01:19:08,553 --> 01:19:11,765
Our Manny's growing up.

663
01:19:12,223 --> 01:19:15,268
Ellie! Ellie!

664
01:19:19,397 --> 01:19:21,483
Manny.

665
01:19:22,901 --> 01:19:27,071
Ellie, l don't want us
to be together because we have to.

666
01:19:27,071 --> 01:19:29,741
l want us to be together because we want to.

667
01:19:29,741 --> 01:19:31,993
And l wanna be with you, Ellie.

668
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:38,625
- What do you say?
- Manny, l thought you were going...

669
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,922
You're possum enough for me.

670
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:05,193
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

671
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:07,778
Fine. But l'm not gonna carry you.

672
01:20:07,778 --> 01:20:12,533
- l still have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.

673
01:20:12,533 --> 01:20:15,119
l'll carry him.

674
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:19,582
- But your herd's leaving.
- We are now.

675
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:21,125
Shotgun!

676
01:20:23,336 --> 01:20:26,130
Manny, who do you like better? Me or Diego?

677
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:29,508
- Diego. lt's not even close.
- Told you.

678
01:20:29,508 --> 01:20:32,470
Manny, you can't choose between your kids.

679
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:35,639
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.

680
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:40,978
lf l had a dog and my dog had a kid
and the dog's kid had a pet, that would be Sid.

681
01:20:40,978 --> 01:20:43,647
- Can l have a dog, Manny?
- No.

682
01:20:43,647 --> 01:20:46,650
- Ellie, can l have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.

683
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:50,279
Ellie, we have to be consistent with him.

684
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:11,836
l saved you, little buddy.

685
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:28,310
Calm down.
l saved you, little buddy. Remember?
