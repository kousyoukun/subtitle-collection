1
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,790
I'm just saying how do
we know it's an ice age?

2
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,710
Because of all the ice!

3
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,410
Well, things just got a little chillier.

4
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,050
Help! Help!

5
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,550
Come on, kids, let's go.
The traffic's moving.

6
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,180
But, but, but dad.

7
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,730
No 'buts'. You can play
'extinction' later.

8
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,600
Okay. Come on, guys.

9
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,870
So, where's Eddie?

10
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,895
He said something about being on a
verge of an evolutionary breakthrough.

11
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,320
Really?

12
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm flying!

13
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,990
Some breakthrough.

14
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,504
Look out!

15
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:44,540
You're going the wrong
way. Crazy mammoth.

16
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,720
Hey, do the world a favour!

17
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,800
Move your issues off the road!

18
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,842
If my trunk was that small,

19
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,310
I wouldn't draw
attention to myself, pal.

20
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
Give me a break.

21
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,350
We've been waddlin' all day.

22
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,770
Oh, go ahead. Follow the crowd.

23
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,610
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

24
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,450
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

25
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,330
Hey, hey. I'm up, I'm up!

26
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,090
Hey, rise and shine, everybody.

27
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,130
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

28
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,510
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

29
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,170
Where is everybody?

30
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,520
Come on, guys.
We gonna miss the mi.. the mi.. the...

31
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,140
...migration.

32
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,330
They left without me.

33
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,360
They do this every year!

34
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,030
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

35
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,790
Isn't there anyone who
cares about Sid the Sloth?

36
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,210
All right, I'll just go by myself.

37
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,250
Oh! Sick!

38
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,310
Hey, wide body! Kerb it next time!

39
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,790
Oh! Jeez... Oh.. Yuck! Oh..

40
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,140
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.

41
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,050
Frank, where did you ever...

42
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,470
Go ahead, dig in.

43
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,885
A dandelion.
I thought the frost wiped them all out.

44
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:29,600
All but one.

45
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,370
Makes me so... I wanna..

46
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,150
Oh! Yuck!

47
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,238
This has definitely not been my day.

48
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,490
I mean... You know what
I'm saying, buddy?

49
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,210
Oh, what a mess.

50
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,876
Hey, you rhinos, you
know, you have really...

51
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,040
tiny brains, did you know that?

52
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,030
No. It's just a fact.

53
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,240
No offence!

54
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,290
But you barely know
what I'm talking about.

55
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, Yummy.

56
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,720
A dandelion.

57
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,800
Must be the last one of the season.

58
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,890
Carl.
Easy, Frankie.

59
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,710
He ruined our salad.

60
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,130
Oh, my mistake.
That was my mistake. Let me...

61
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,310
No, seriously, let me take care of this.

62
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,370
Oh. What is this?

63
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,240
Pine cones!

64
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,360
Oh my goodness, they're my favourite.

65
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,620
Hmm, delicious.

66
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,370
Au.

67
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,860
That's a... good eating.

68
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,210
Don't let me hog them all up.
No, here, you have some.

69
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,410
Tasty, isn't it?

70
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,080
Bon appétit.

71
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,920
Now?

72
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,750
Now.

73
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,470
Hey!

74
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,300
Just pretend that I am not here.

75
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,985
I wanna hit him at full speed.

76
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:48,680
That's okay, Frank.
We'll have some fun with him.

77
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,310
Don't let them impale me, please.
I wanna live!

78
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,350
Get off me!

79
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,830
Come on, you're making a scene.

80
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,860
We'll just take our furry pinata and go.
Would you mind?

81
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,980
Hey. Buddy, if it's not them today,
it's just someone else tomorrow.

82
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,660
I like rather not be today. Okay?

83
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,762
Look. We're gonnaa break
your neck so you...

84
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,040
don't feel a thing. How's that?

85
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,080
Wait a minute.
I thought rhinos were vegetarians.

86
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,240
An excelent point.
Shut up!

87
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,090
Who says we gonna eat him
after we kill him?

88
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,960
Yeh, come on, move it.

89
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,080
You know, I don't like
animals that kill for pleasure.

90
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,590
Save it for a mammal that cares.

91
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,630
I'm a mammal that cares.

92
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,585
Okay, look. If either of you make it

93
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:27,860
across that sink hole in front
of you, you get the Sloth.

94
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,180
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

95
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,690
You were bluffing, huh?
Yeah, that was a bluff.

96
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,360
Get him!

97
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,610
A dandelion?

98
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,650
We did it!

99
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,950
What?

100
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,710
You have beautiful eyes.

101
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,670
Get off my face.

102
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,660
Wow, you and me, we make a great team.

103
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,210
I mean. What'd you say we
just head South together?

104
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,501
Great!

105
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,720
Yeah, hey jump up on my back
and relax your whole way.

106
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,680
Wow. Really?
No.

107
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,670
Wait, aren't you going to South?

108
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,100
The changing seasons,
migration instincts?

109
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,980
Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
I guess not, bye.

110
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,940
Okay, then thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

111
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,940
Hey, you over-grown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

112
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,695
Ohohou. That south
thing is way overrated.

113
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:07,350
The heat, the crowd. Who needs any?

114
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,258
Isn't this great? You
and me, two bachelors...

115
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:11,985
knockin' about in the wild.

116
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:13,734
No, you just want a bodyguard...

117
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,960
so you don't become
somebody's side dish.

118
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,500
You're very shrewd mammal.

119
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,540
Can you lead the way, Mr. Big Guy?
Didn't get the name.

120
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,420
Manfred.
Manfred? Yuck.

121
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,930
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

122
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,180
Stop following me.

123
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,400
OK, so you've got issues.
Look, you won't even know I'm here.

124
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,360
I'll just zip the lip when I say...

125
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,650
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

126
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,410
Isn't it nice if he'll be
joining us for breakfast?

127
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,830
It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

128
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,966
Especially since his
daddy wiped out half...

129
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,790
our pack and wears
our skin to keep warm.

130
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,960
An eye for an eye. Don't you think?

131
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,630
Let's show that human what happens
when he messes with Sabers.

132
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,800
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

133
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,635
And Diego, bring me that baby. Alive.

134
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:03,900
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

135
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,550
Phew. I'm wiped out.

136
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,010
That's your shelter?

137
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,497
Hey. You're a big guy.
You got a lot of wood.

138
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,430
I'm a little guy.

139
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,840
You've got half a stick.

140
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,590
Yeah, but with my little stick,
and my highly evolved brain...

141
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,680
I shall create fire.

142
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,440
Fascinating.

143
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,696
We'll see if brains
triumph over brawn tonight.

144
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:47,770
Now, won't we?

145
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,160
Hey, I think I saw spark.

146
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,544
Any chance I can squeeze
in there with you Manny?

147
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:03,080
Old pal?

148
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,630
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

149
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,710
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

150
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,930
My family abandoned me. They
just kinda migrated without me.

151
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,390
You should see what they did last year.

152
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,050
You know, I mean. They woke up early and
finely tied my hands and feet.

153
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,863
and they gagged me with a
fieldmouse, barricaded the cave door,

154
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:26,940
and covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

155
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,650
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

156
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,240
So what about you? You've family?

157
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,693
Okay, you're tired, I see.

158
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,660
Well, we'll talk more
tomorrow in the morning.

159
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,040
Au, Au, A, A, Au, Au.

160
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,880
Manfred? Manfred.

161
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,500
Could you scooch over a drop?

162
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,340
Come on, nobody falls asleep that fast.

163
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,300
Manny!

164
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,020
There's Diego, fall back!

165
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,980
Where's the baby?

166
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,150
I've lost it over the falls.
You lost it?

167
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,570
I want that baby, Diego.
I'll get it.

168
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,700
You'd better. Unless you want to serve
yourself as the replacement.

169
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,120
We'll go up to Half peak. Meet us there.

170
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,040
It'd better be alive.

171
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,210
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

172
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,420
Let's go!

173
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,950
and then she picked this hair
off my shoulder and says, look...

174
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,695
If you're gonna have
an extra mating dance,

175
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:53,280
at least pick a female with
the same color pelt, right?

176
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,394
And I thought, wow, she's
gonna go praying mantis on me.

177
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:56,660
I mean, you know what I'm saying?

178
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,410
If you find a mate in
life, you should be loyal.

179
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,750
In your case, grateful.
Get away from me.

180
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,195
Well, I think mating for life is stupid.

181
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:06,760
I mean there's plenty
of Sid to go around.

182
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,470
Manny?

183
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,700
Look at that.
He's okay.

184
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,920
She's gone.

185
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,850
Hey, hey, hey Manny, are
you forgetting something?

186
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,425
No.
But you just saved him.

187
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,555
Yeah, but I'm still trying to get
rid of the last thing I saved.

188
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:42,560
You can't leave him here.

189
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,580
Look, there's smoke.

190
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,780
That's his herd right up the
hill. We should return him.

191
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,700
Let's get something straight here. Okay?
There's no 'we'.

192
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,700
There never was a 'we'.

193
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,250
In fact, without me, there
wouldn't even be a 'you'!

194
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,750
Just up the hill.

195
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,420
Listen very carefully.
I'm not g-o-i-n-g.

196
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,090
Fine. Be a jerk.

197
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,640
I'll take care of him.

198
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,260
Go. Yeah, that's good.

199
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,005
You'll take care...
You can't even take care of yourself.

200
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:17,100
This I gotta see.

201
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,240
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

202
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,900
No, we don't.

203
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,140
You're the embarrassment of
the nature, do you know that?

204
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,195
That is cake.

205
00:20:58,295 --> 00:21:00,310
I'm fine. I'm fine!

206
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,850
I'm gonna die.

207
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,590
That pink thing is mine.

208
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,010
No, actually that pink
thing belongs to us.

209
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,640
Us? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

210
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,385
There is no 'us'.
I see.

211
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:46,690
Can't have one of your
own, so you want to adopt.

212
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,020
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt this snack.

213
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,270
But we gotta go.

214
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,185
The baby, please.

215
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:53,690
I was returning him to his herd.

216
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,085
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

217
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:58,200
You're calling me a liar?
I didn't say that.

218
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,910
You were thinking it.

219
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,830
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

220
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,140
Name is Diego, friend.

221
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,040
Manfred. And I'm not your friend.

222
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,170
Fine, Manfred.

223
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,050
If you're looking for the
humans, you're wasting your time.

224
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,470
They left this morning.

225
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,510
Thanks for the advice. Now beat this.

226
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,760
All right, I'll help you
bring it to its herd.

227
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,880
But promise me that you
leave me alone after that.

228
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,600
Okay, okay, deal.

229
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,390
What's your problem?
You're my problem.

230
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,850
But I think you're stressed.
That's why you eat so much.

231
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,975
I mean. It's hard to
get fat on a vegan diet.

232
00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:34,190
I'm not fat. It's all that fur.
It makes me look puffy.

233
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,860
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

234
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,290
I don't know. Just drop it on the ledge.

235
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,370
Shouldn't we make sure they found him?
Good idea.

236
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,040
No, no, no!
Wait. Wait.

237
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,840
Don't spear me!

238
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,710
Ohhhm. This is a problem.

239
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,260
Now what?

240
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,140
Oh. That's perfect.

241
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,050
I told you they were gone.

242
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,260
Look who it is.

243
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't you have some poor
defenseless animals to disembowel?

244
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,420
They couldn't be far. I
mean. They went this way?

245
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,180
Or this way?

246
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,420
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

247
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,310
Hey, I'm a Sloth. I see a tree,
either leaf, that's my tracking.

248
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,560
You didn't miss them by much.

249
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,310
It's still green.

250
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,350
They headed north 2 hours ago.

251
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,570
It's still green. They
headed north 2 hours ago.

252
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,280
You don't need this aggravation.

253
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,080
Give me the baby.

254
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,540
I can track humans a
lot faster than you can.

255
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,290
And you're just a good
citizen helping out, right?

256
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,380
I just know where the humans are going.

257
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,000
Glacier-pass.

258
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,380
Everybody knows they have a
settlement on the other side.

259
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,460
Well, unless you know how to track,

260
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,600
you've never gonna reach them before
the pass closes up with snow.

261
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,470
Which should be like, tomorrow.

262
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,870
So you can give that baby to me
or go get lost in the blizzard.

263
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,480
It's your choice.

264
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,200
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We'll return it to the humans.

265
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,622
Oooh. The Big Bad Tigey
Wigey get left behind.

266
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:50,210
Poor Tigey Wigey...

267
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,960
Sid, Tigey Wigey is gonna lead the way.

268
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,380
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

269
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,170
No.

270
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,877
The sooner we find the humans,

271
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:04,360
the sooner I get rid of
Mr. Stinky-drool-face.

272
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,970
And the baby too.

273
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,730
You won't always have jumbo
around to protect you.

274
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,240
And when that day comes, I
suggest you watch your back.

275
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,270
Cause I'll be chewing on it.

276
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,110
Hey, human-tracker, up
front where I can see you.

277
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,780
Help me.

278
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,375
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it anymore!

279
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:43,290
I've eaten things that
didn't complain this much.

280
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,585
He won't stop squirming.
You're holding it wrong.

281
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:47,736
Watch its head! Just put it down!

282
00:25:47,836 --> 00:25:50,715
Jeez, 'pick him up, put
him down, make him... '

283
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,220
Its nose's dry.

284
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,135
That means something is wrong with it.

285
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:56,240
Someone should lick it. Just in case.

286
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,020
I'll do it.

287
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,270
Hey, he's wearing one
of those baby thingies.

288
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,150
So?
So if it poops, where does it go?

289
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,525
Humans are disgusting.

290
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:07,620
Okay, you.

291
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,830
Check for poop.

292
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,370
Hey. Why am I the poop checker?

293
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,940
Because returning him
home was your idea.

294
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,370
Because you're small and insignificant.

295
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,920
And because I'll pummel
you if you don't.

296
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,460
Why else?
Now, Sid!

297
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,680
Yuhh. Yuck. Yuhh.

298
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,500
I mean, my goodness.

299
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,180
All right, look out, look
out. Coming through.

300
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,510
Watch out!
Stop waving that thing around!

301
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
Oh, I'm gonna slip!

302
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,770
It's clean! Got you!

303
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,490
Would you cut it out!

304
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,740
Hey, do that again.
He likes it.

305
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,790
It's makin' me feel better too.

306
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:05,090
Here, you hold it.
Turn him towards me.

307
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,760
Where is the baby?
There it is!

308
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,465
Where is the baby?

309
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,730
There it is!

310
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,020
Stop it! You're scaring him!

311
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,150
I bet he's hungry.

312
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,070
How about some milk?

313
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,030
Uhh. I'd love some.
Not you, the baby.

314
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,910
Well I ain't exactly
lactating right now, pal.

315
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,280
You're a little low on the
food chain to... aren't you?

316
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,500
Enough!

317
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,840
Food!

318
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,840
I don't know, but I've been told...

319
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,180
I don't know, but I've been told...
End of the world be mighty cold...

320
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,120
Prepare for the ice age!

321
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,610
Protect the Dodo way of life!

322
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,690
Survivals separate the
Dodos from the beasts.

323
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,160
Ice age?

324
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,290
I've heard of these crackpots.

325
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,210
Intruders!

326
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,520
Don't fall in. If you
do, you'll definitely...

327
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,420
Intruders!

328
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,500
Intru... Uaaaa.

329
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,300
Uuuuuuuh.

330
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,090
Burn and die.

331
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,295
Hey, can we have our melon back?

332
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:35,680
Junior is hungry and...

333
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,140
No way! This is our private
stockpile for the ice age.

334
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,400
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

335
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,020
So you've got three melons?

336
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,450
If you weren't smart enough to
plan ahead, then doom on you.

337
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,950
Doom on you! Doom on you!

338
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,490
Get away from me!

339
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,040
Oh! No!

340
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,920
Retrieve the melon!

341
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,750
Taikwondoodos!

342
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,080
Taikwondoodos! Attack!

343
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,060
The melon!

344
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,230
There goes our last female.

345
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:38,700
Got it, got it, got it. Don't got it.
The Last Melon!

346
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,930
Aghhh. Sid!

347
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,210
Now we gotta find more food.

348
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,880
Right, more to the right.
Right, right, right.

349
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,680
Hey, look at that. Dinner and a show.

350
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,640
Left! Left, left... left!
Leeft! Aaaa... Ugh! Uaaaaau!

351
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,770
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

352
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,060
What ho? A foe?

353
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,570
Come on, come on. You
want a piece of me?

354
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,990
Spoils!

355
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,910
worthy of such a noble...

356
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,410
Uuuh!

357
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,580
Bedtime, squirt.

358
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,560
Oh. The triumphant return!

359
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,980
Hh? Oh that.. hhh.

360
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm so full.

361
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,400
How about a good night kiss
for your big buddy, Sid??

362
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,400
Shh. He's asleep.

363
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,360
I was talking to you.

364
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,320
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

365
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,620
All right, gooood niiight.

366
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,270
Will you stop it!

367
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,770
All right. All right.

368
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,110
I was trying to relax.

369
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,740
Oy...

370
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,290
What the... Go ahead. Slice me.

371
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,865
It'll be the last thing you ever do.

372
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,900
I'm working here, you waste of fur.

373
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,590
Frustrated Diego.

374
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,620
Tracking down helpless
infants too difficult for you?

375
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,710
What are you two doing here?

376
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,800
Soto's getting tired of waiting.

377
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,220
Yeah. Yeah. He said,
come back with the baby,

378
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,220
or don't come back at all!

379
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,100
Well, I have a message for Soto.

380
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,900
Tell him, I'm bringing the baby.

381
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,570
And tell him, I'm bringing a mammoth.

382
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,780
A mammoth.

383
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Mammoths never travel alone.

384
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,240
Well, this one does.
And I'm leading him to Half peak.

385
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,950
Look at all that meat.

386
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,990
Let's get him! Not yet!

387
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,830
We need the whole pack to
bring this mammoth down.

388
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,460
Get everyone ready.

389
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,920
Now!

390
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,660
Where is the baby?

391
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,530
You lost it?

392
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,250
Sid!

393
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,790
It's so ugly.
Positively adorable.

394
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,660
Hello, pumpkin. Hello,
little baldy bean.

395
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,020
Where did you find it?

396
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,620
Ah. The poor kid all alone in the wild.

397
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,760
Sabers were closing in on him.
So I just snatched him.

398
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,140
Oh. So brave.

399
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,310
Yeh. Well, he needed me and
I only wish I have one of my own.

400
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,390
Really?

401
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,480
I find that attractive in a male.

402
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,610
Who wouldn't want a
family, I always say.

403
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,030
Wher you've been hiding?

404
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,070
Yeh. Well, you know.

405
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,040
Cute kid, huh?

406
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,200
So, so what I was saying, ladies...

407
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,080
Hey! Hi! Manny!

408
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,210
What's the matter with you?

409
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,730
Excuse me, ladies.

410
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,380
You just keep marinating
and I'll be right back.

411
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,100
Sssss. Sexy.

412
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,310
He's not much to look at
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

413
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,560
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

414
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,865
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

415
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:26,160
Why? A good looking guy like you?

416
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,665
No. You say that, but you don't mean it.

417
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:29,400
No, seriously, look at you.

418
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,070
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

419
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,980
We have a very cruel sense of humour.

420
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,540
Hey. Don't let me cramp your style.

421
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,370
Oh. Thanks, Manny. You're pal.

422
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,660
You are the best.
Without Pinky.

423
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,460
Manny, Manny, I need him.

424
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,800
So, ladies, where were we?

425
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,180
Carl?
Easy, Frankie.

426
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,760
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly
he moves like a cheetah.

427
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,945
And that tiger.

428
00:36:58,045 --> 00:37:01,560
Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

429
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,770
What am I? The wet nurse?

430
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,770
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

431
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,910
Look at you. You gonna grow
in a great predator, huh?

432
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,370
I don't think so.

433
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,910
What do you got? You got a little...

434
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,750
patch of fur, no fang, no claws.

435
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,170
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.
What's so threatening about you?

436
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Hey, Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

437
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,310
Okay. All right, wise guy.

438
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,060
You just earned a time-out.

439
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,480
Oh you think that's
funny? How about this?

440
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,400
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

441
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,200
You're a brave little
squirt, I'll give you that.

442
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,830
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.

443
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,380
Oh. No, a tiger!
Help! Help!

444
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,685
Where's the baby?

445
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:12,319
Oo he's fine. Manfred has him.

446
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:14,745
Just put me in your
mouth. Come on. Hurry up.

447
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:18,170
He got me!
Help...

448
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,470
Get away from me.

449
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,100
It went this way.
Over here.

450
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,200
No, Carl!
The tiger beat us to him.

451
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,410
Wait a minute.

452
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,460
He's dead, all right.

453
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,670
No. Carnivores have all the fun.

454
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,241
Gosh, I hate breaking
their hearts like that.

455
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:54,800
But you know how it is.

456
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,590
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.

457
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,350
Manny! Manny!

458
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,480
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.

459
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,730
And Diego spit that out.
You don't know where it's been.

460
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,940
Boy. For a second there, I
actually thought you gonna eat me.

461
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,390
I don't eat junk food.

462
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,100
Ha, ha, there you gotta...

463
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,650
I thought you're gonna... Were you?

464
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,875
Come on. Wait up. Wait up!

465
00:39:22,975 --> 00:39:25,410
Wait... come on, come on.
Can you wait a second please?

466
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,540
Hey, fellows!

467
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,210
Huh. Thanks for waiting.

468
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,590
3, 2, 1.

469
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,470
Sure is faithful.

470
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,320
Don't make me reach back there.
That was he. He started it.

471
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,950
I don't care who started it.
I'll finish it.

472
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,440
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

473
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Hi, Manny.

474
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,710
Hi, Diego.

475
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,680
Hey, Sid.

476
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,930
You're lost, aren't you?
No, I know exactly where we are.

477
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,310
Ask him direction.

478
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,940
I don't need directions.
Fine, I'll ask him.

479
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,150
Hey, buddy. Have you seen
any humans go by here?

480
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:23,240
U u u. I love this game!
I love this game! Okay, okay.

481
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,610
Three words.

482
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,490
First word... a stomp.

483
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,200
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

484
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,250
Let me try.

485
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,540
Hmm... Pack.
Good word, Manny.

486
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,460
Pack of long teeth...

487
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,590
and claws?

488
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,760
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

489
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,510
Pack of bears? - - - - -mumble-
- - - - - Pack of fleas.

490
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,510
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

491
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,180
Ehmmm. Pachyderm?

492
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,050
Pack of lies. Pack of
troubles. Pack a wallop.

493
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,890
Pack of.. Aooooou!.. birds.
Pa.. pack of flying fish!

494
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,150
Hey! Great news.

495
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,900
I found a short cut!

496
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,780
What do you mean short cut?

497
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,200
I mean faster that the long way around.

498
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,000
Au! I know what a short cut is...

499
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,410
Look, either we slip through there and
and beat the humans at the Glacier Pass.

500
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,500
Or take the long way and miss them.

501
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,300
Through there!

502
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,880
What do you take me for?

503
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,720
This time tomorrow you
could be a free mammoth.

504
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,760
Or a nanny. personally I
never get tired of peekaboo.

505
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,890
Hey guys. Hey guys check this out.

506
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,140
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

507
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,480
No thanks, I choose life.

508
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,645
Then I suggest you take the short cut!

509
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:25,230
Are you threatening me?

510
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,950
Move sloth!

511
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,660
Way to go, tiger.

512
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,910
Quick. Get inside.

513
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,320
OK, I vote short cut.

514
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,380
Come on guys. Stick together
it's easy to get lost in here.

515
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,690
Eh, guys!

516
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,620
Eh, eh... Fish.

517
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,170
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

518
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,300
I got you!

519
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,740
Captain! Iceberg ahead!

520
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,240
Oh no.

521
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:59,180
Wow! Huh! Yeah! Who's up for round two!
Tell the kid to be more careful.

522
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,930
Look, look. Tigers.

523
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,240
No. It's ok. It's ok.

524
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,600
Look the tigers are just
playing tag with the antilope.

525
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:53,770
With their teeth.

526
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:58,110
Come on Sid, lets play tag - you're it.

527
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,210
Sure.

528
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:03,530
Ok, ok. Where are the sloth?

529
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,693
You know. You never see
any sloth in these things.

530
00:49:05,793 --> 00:49:06,660
Have you ever noticed?

531
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,330
Oh look Manny! A mammoth.

532
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,460
Uuh. Somebody pinch me.

533
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,075
Hey, hey this fat one.

534
00:49:12,175 --> 00:49:13,540
Looks just like you.

535
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,050
Oh, he's got a family.

536
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,670
Oh, he's happy.

537
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,220
Look he is playing with his kid.

538
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,300
See Manny that's your problem.

539
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,050
That's what mammoths supposed to do.

540
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:24,365
Sid.

541
00:49:24,465 --> 00:49:26,310
Find a she-mmoth, have
the little baby mammoth...

542
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,950
Sid!
What?

543
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,390
Shut up!

544
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,850
Well. Would you look at that.

545
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,610
The tiger actually did
it. There's Half-peak.

546
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,150
Next stop. Glacier pass.

547
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,200
How could I ever have doubted you?

548
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,400
Did you hear that little fella?

549
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,200
You are almost home?

550
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,740
My feet are sweating.

551
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,710
Do we have to get a news flash
every time your body does something?

552
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,380
Don't pay attention. Just ignore him

553
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,710
Seriously, my feet are really hot...

554
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,210
Tell me that was your stomach.

555
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,020
I am sure it was just thunder.

556
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,480
From under.., ground?

557
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,950
Come on keep up with me.

558
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,960
I would if you were moving.

559
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,760
Wow. I wish I could jump like that.

560
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,970
Wish granted.

561
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,060
Come on move faster.

562
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,810
Have you noticed the river of lava?

563
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,330
Hold Pinky!

564
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,320
Manny!

565
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,620
Manny, Manny, Manny are you ok?

566
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,710
Come on, come on say something.
Anything!

567
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:36,510
What. What? I can't hear you.

568
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,800
You are standing on my trunk.

569
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,100
Are you OK?

570
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:42,970
Why did you do that?

571
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,440
You could have die trying to save me.

572
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:48,730
That's what you do in a herd...

573
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,070
We look out for each other.

574
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,900
Well... thanks.

575
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,120
I don't now how about you guys, but...

576
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,030
we're the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

577
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,780
I can't wait to get my
claws in that mammoth.

578
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:26,270
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

579
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,454
First, I'm gonna slice its
hind quarters into sections.

580
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,350
I'm on to put the white meat
in one pile and dark in ano...

581
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,490
Hey. Knock it off. I am starving.

582
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:40,610
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

583
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:42,170
I told you to knock it off!

584
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,040
Save your energy!

585
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,370
Mammoths don't go down easy.

586
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,830
There is only one way to do it.

587
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,420
First you have to
force it into a corner.

588
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:54,760
Cut off his retreat.

589
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,010
And when you three have it trapped...

590
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,010
I'll go for the throat.

591
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,900
Guys. We gotta get this
kid out of the wind.

592
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,320
How much further? 3 miles.

593
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,950
I'm beat. We'll get
there in the morning.

594
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,215
What're you doing?

595
00:57:26,315 --> 00:57:28,210
I'm putting sloth on the map.

596
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,590
Hey. Why don't you make it
realistic and draw him lying down?

597
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,590
And make him rounder.

598
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:39,880
Perfect.

599
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,260
I forgot how to laugh.

600
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,650
I am a genius.

601
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,940
From now one you'll have
to refer to me as...

602
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,560
Sid, Lord of the flame.

603
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,950
Hey, Lord of the flame,
your tail's on fire.

604
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:13,460
Thank you.

605
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,800
From now one I'm gonna call You Diego.

606
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,720
Lord you've touched me and you are dead.

607
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,340
I am just kidding you
little knuckle-head.

608
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,600
Hey lovebirds. Look at this.

609
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,060
I don't believe it.

610
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:50,910
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

611
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,830
Come to uncle Sid.

612
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,210
No no this way, this way.

613
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,880
No. no, no. Go to him. Go to him.

614
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,140
Ok...

615
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,180
Good job.

616
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,560
Keep practising.

617
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:19,360
Look at that. Our little
guy is growing up.

618
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:32,110
Come on. Sleep time. Lumpy.
Look at that big pushover.

619
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:37,500
You know Diego, I've never had a friend
who'd risk his life for me.

620
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:42,670
Yeah, Manny's... is a good guy.

621
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,580
Yeah he is.

622
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,340
Well, good night

623
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,550
All right. Let's get you all cleaned up.

624
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:27,130
I mean what's your daddy gonna say when
we go back smudgy and stinky like this?

625
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,800
OK. Let me just clean that up.

626
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,890
That looks good and little bit here...

627
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:33,180
You clean up nice - little fellow.

628
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:36,310
I think he start to look like me.
Hey Diego, what do you say?

629
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,060
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

630
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:41,110
Why not?

631
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:43,400
Because if we save him,
he'll grow up to be a hunter.

632
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,280
And who do you think he'll hunt?

633
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,304
Maybe because we save
him he won't hunt us.

634
01:00:47,404 --> 01:00:47,490
Au!

635
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:52,580
Yeh, maybe he'll grow fur and a long
skinny neck and call you mamma!

636
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,660
What is your problem?

637
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,210
Nothing. Lets go, it's
freezing my tail off.

638
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,900
Hey Diego you've frozen back there.

639
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,530
Get down.
What?

640
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,560
Shhh!
Get down and follow me.

641
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,650
Hey, hey! What's going on?

642
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:33,370
At the bottom of Half-peak...
there is an ambush waiting for you.

643
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,950
What?
What do you mean ambush.

644
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,240
You set us up?

645
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,950
It was my job, I was supposed
to get the baby but then...

646
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:43,750
You brought us home for dinner!

647
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,910
That's it, you're out of the herd.

648
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:46,790
I am sorry.

649
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,220
No you are not. Not yet.

650
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,760
Listen, I can help you.

651
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:51,980
Stay close Sid.

652
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,210
We can fight our way out.

653
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,140
You can't. Pack's too strong.

654
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,340
You have to trust me!

655
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,720
Trust you? Why in the
world would we trust you?

656
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,020
Because I am your only chance.

657
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,410
Hello ladies!

658
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,910
Hey look who decided to show up.

659
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,920
Diego. I was beginning
to worry about you.

660
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,750
No need to worry.

661
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,158
In about 2 minutes you'll
be satisfying your taste...

662
01:02:29,258 --> 01:02:30,170
for revenge.

663
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,380
Very nice!

664
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,500
I see the sloth!

665
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,550
And he's got the baby!

666
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:38,310
Don't give away your positions
until we see the mammoth.

667
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,310
He's the one we have to surprise.

668
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,150
You wanna maul something.
Don't you think?

669
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,900
I wanna maul.

670
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,530
Then what are you waiting for?

671
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,900
No, I said wait for the mammoth!

672
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:17,300
Yohou! Backscratcher. Ahaa!

673
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:18,560
Eat my powder!

674
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,040
Loop-de-loop. Slalom, slalom baby!

675
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:09,650
Sorry fellas, it got a little frostbite.

676
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:11,940
Get him!

677
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:18,200
Surprise!

678
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,865
Ok, follow me.

679
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:27,370
We'll pick up Sid and get
outta here while we can.

680
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,380
Come on Diego, let's
bring this mammoth down.

681
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,730
There he is.

682
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,150
That's right - where's the baby. Oh!

683
01:04:54,690 --> 01:05:01,370
Survival of the fittest.
I don't think so. Yeah!

684
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,330
What are you doing?

685
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:16,670
Leave the mammoth alone!

686
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,850
Fine! I'll take you down first.

687
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,010
We did it!

688
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:56,060
We were some team, huh?

689
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,440
Were? Come on. We're still a team.

690
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,360
I am sorry I set you up.

691
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:06,700
Ah. You know me. I'm too
lazy to hold a grudge.

692
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,710
Hey. Knock it off. squirt.

693
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:14,210
You have to be strong.

694
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,380
You have to take care
of Manfred and Sid.

695
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:21,090
Especially Sid.

696
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,199
Come on. You can lick
this. You're a tiger.

697
01:07:25,299 --> 01:07:28,810
Look I'll carry you. Come
on, what do you say?

698
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,310
Come on Diego, come on.

699
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:34,230
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

700
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:38,400
Listen. You have to leave me here.

701
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:43,610
If those humans get through the
pass, you'll never catch them.

702
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,280
You didn't have to do that.

703
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,450
That's what you do in a herd.

704
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,820
Don't forget about us, ok?

705
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,780
We won't forget about you.

706
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,700
Good bye.

707
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:59,700
Good bye. Good bye.

708
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:00,540
Sid.

709
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,790
Good bye.

710
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:10,750
That's right. Where is the baby?

711
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,800
Come on Sid.

712
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,630
Let's head South.

713
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:37,860
Save your breath Sid. You
know humans can't talk.

714
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,490
Diego?

715
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,880
You're Ok!

716
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,540
9 lives baby.

717
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,080
You're ok. You're ok.

718
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:48,700
I could kiss ya. m. m.
m. m. m. m. m. m. m.

719
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,580
Yuck, yuck. Bleeh.

720
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,880
Welcome back partner. Want a lift?

721
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,800
No thanks. I've got to save
whatever dignity I've got left.

722
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,500
You're hanging out with us now, buddy.
Dignity's got nothing to do with it.

723
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,750
But I'll take that lift.

724
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,310
Yeh. Climb aboard.
Pick me up, buddy.

725
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,560
Mush!

726
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:07,890
Or not mush, either way.

727
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:13,445
This gonna be the best
migration ever. I'm telling you.

728
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:15,741
I'll show you all my
favourite watering holes.

729
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:18,010
I turn brown when the
fungus in my fur dries.

730
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:19,815
Sounds very attractive!

731
01:13:19,915 --> 01:13:22,617
You know. This whole Ice
age thing's getting old.

732
01:13:22,717 --> 01:13:25,195
You know what I could
go for? Global warming!

733
01:13:25,295 --> 01:13:25,790
Aye.

734
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:27,030
Keep dreamin'.

735
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:27,710
No, really!
