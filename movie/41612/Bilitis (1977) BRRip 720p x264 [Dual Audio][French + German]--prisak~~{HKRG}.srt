1
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,562
He is so far from here...

2
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:42,726
across the very mountain...

3
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,306
I see him...

4
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:47,165
I hear him...

5
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:50,673
I feel him...

6
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:52,912
and I feel him touching me.

7
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,062
Mademoiselle,
the other classes have left already.

8
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:05,962
Yes, we should go.

9
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:08,875
- Bilitis, where are you going?
- To go and change.

10
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:12,172
No, no, come as you are.
The others are waiting.

11
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,336
Okay.

12
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,408
Hooray for Ms. Larsen!

13
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:37,907
To the beach!

14
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:41,350
- Without a bathing suit!
- Especially without a bathing suit!

15
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,576
Listen now, girls.

16
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:47,913
It's too late to go to the abbey.

17
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:53,243
I changed our plans,
but behave yourselves.

18
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,036
Don't worry Ms. Larsen...

19
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:56,913
We always behave like ladies!

20
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,835
Oh! It's cold!

21
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,203
We must hurry!

22
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,828
Come, let's go!

23
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,209
- Stay together!
- I want to bathe!

24
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:36,992
Stay with me!

25
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:39,162
You never do things with the others.

26
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,536
Are you still fighting?

27
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,745
Hey, look at these!

28
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,969
- I have them too!
- Mine is larger!

29
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:21,885
I have something better!

30
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:24,078
If I was in love, I would choose Flora.

31
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:27,287
Look at them! Disgusting!

32
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,097
- I will never kiss a boy.
- Except when you're in love.

33
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:40,620
I'm not at all interested!

34
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,412
Girls, please...

35
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,294
Sit down.

36
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:10,353
Head up, back straight.

37
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,105
Show him to me.

38
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:15,643
He belongs to both of us, let's see!

39
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:33,799
Mademoiselle.

40
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,609
Mademoiselle, yes, you.

41
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:39,995
Head up, beautiful right...

42
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:45,525
Smile... attention...

43
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:48,151
Thank you!

44
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,315
Okay, get your things ready.

45
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,945
I looked at him cross-eyed,
then he took the picture.

46
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,528
He can't be that good a photographer.
He's too cute!

47
00:08:57,608 --> 00:09:01,321
Why do we have to wrap up now?
We have so much to do tomorrow.

48
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:04,355
Quiet, girls, quiet.
You are not on holiday.

49
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:11,111
Girls...

50
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,668
together...

51
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,828
size order...

52
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,495
Very good. Head up.

53
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,152
That's it!

54
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:29,268
- Are you coming to the festival tomorrow?
- Yes, certainly.

55
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:33,183
- It's our class that's doing the show.
- Really?

56
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,701
Don't move... that's good.

57
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,039
Smile...

58
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:42,679
Attention!

59
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:45,512
Thank you!

60
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:52,555
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

61
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,495
His name is Lucas

62
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,275
I let the turtle go.

63
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:20,948
- Touché!
- Hey, are you crazy?

64
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:29,870
Do you do that to all the boys?

65
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,546
No. You're the first to pass here.

66
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,370
You could have hurt me, you know?

67
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:37,965
Oh, with a piece of bread.

68
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:41,120
It's the intention that counts.
The attack was premeditated.

69
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,296
To you, I'm like a boy.

70
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:48,537
You don't look like a boy.

71
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:53,508
My father said I could have been a boy.
You'd better be careful.

72
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:55,995
What name did your father give you?

73
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:57,717
Bilitis.

74
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:13,995
What are you doing?

75
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,245
I came to see if Bilitis is a boy.

76
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,971
- If you come any closer, I'll shout.
- Go ahead.

77
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:26,472
I'll jump.

78
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,099
Oh, you would jump for me?

79
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,577
- What do you mean 'for me'?
- No, not for me, for you.

80
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:35,882
- For you?
- Not for you, for Lucas.

81
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,510
That's me.

82
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:39,870
I think you're crazy.

83
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:41,862
Crazy about you.

84
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,519
Can I kiss you?

85
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,999
Go ahead, I dare you to try.

86
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,703
What is it?

87
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,701
He tried to kiss me.

88
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:54,705
Lucas tried to kiss you?

89
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:57,406
More or less.

90
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,351
How, more or less?

91
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,219
I didn't want to.

92
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,846
Bilitis loves Lucas...

93
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:08,622
Bilitis loves Lucas...

94
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,809
When is your father coming?

95
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:17,826
In the next two or three weeks.

96
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:20,144
After he returns from Canada.

97
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:24,105
Who is that woman,
who's taken you in?

98
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,584
A girlfriend of my father.

99
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,390
Is she old?

100
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:32,000
No, she's the daughter of
a friend of my father's.

101
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,808
The last time I saw her,
I was still little.

102
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,500
Would you miss me?

103
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:40,545
More or less.

104
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:46,323
Who do you prefer, Lucas or me?

105
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:54,443
What's got into you?

106
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:56,893
Close your eyes

107
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,828
I am Lucas.

108
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,206
But no, you are a girl.

109
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:18,054
Quit it.

110
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:20,954
Close your eyes.

111
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:54,784
It's important for our former
students to return later on.

112
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:57,829
For the younger ones,
the example is inspiring for them.

113
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:00,832
And for the elders...
Oh... Pardon me...

114
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:05,503
It is pleasant to return one's
self to the "old" ambience.

115
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,969
The ambience today is quite exceptional.

116
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:10,114
The students are excited by our festival.

117
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:12,660
They aren't here on hand.

118
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,764
- It's like they are on holiday already.
- I know how it is.

119
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,766
Yes, but, Mr...

120
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:21,268
Yes, I know that Melissa has
been well educated.

121
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,995
That's the reason why I married her.

122
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:28,250
I look awful

123
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:32,362
I look ugly.

124
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,636
You look like a clown.

125
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:37,157
- And you a brush.
- You want a smack?

126
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,837
You are a reject.

127
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,872
And to see my face!

128
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:44,670
- Well, you didn't smile.
- I moved!

129
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,420
What are you looking at?
That's the wrong side!

130
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,037
- Lucas Mercier... photographer.
- Give me that!

131
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,551
Watch it. Do you want everyone to know?

132
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:59,219
- Know what?
- "Know what?"

133
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,221
About you and Lucas!

134
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,912
Come and look!

135
00:16:03,386 --> 00:16:05,851
- Who is that?
- Look at her, she's beautiful.

136
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,391
- And he's handsome!
- They don't look like parents.

137
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:13,162
I think that is Melissa...
Melissa Ampton. She's an alumni.

138
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:17,495
Was Bilitis informed?

139
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,620
- Naturally!
- Bilitis!

140
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,491
She's coming!

141
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:24,619
That's my mother.
This will not be a friendly day.

142
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,881
It doesn't make a difference to me.

143
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:30,466
I heard the nicest young men around
wanted to marry her.

144
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:33,001
But she chose someone who nobody knew.

145
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,122
My sister told me.

146
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,703
They were good friends.

147
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:43,853
- Hello.
- Hello.

148
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:48,565
I am Melissa Ampton Demarne,
Demarne is my married name.

149
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:51,067
- This is my husband.
- Hello.

150
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:54,821
I never recognised you.
Lovely, isn't she, Pierre?

151
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,236
Charming...

152
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,411
But... I detest uniforms.

153
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:03,789
- Bilitis, we have to get ready, come!
- Excuse me.

154
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,944
Did you have to offend her?

155
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:07,642
But, no.

156
00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:11,790
Well, I wish you much
pleasure on that one.

157
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,801
- Bilitis, it's up to you.
- I'm scared.

158
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,555
- He is there.
- Who?

159
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:07,910
The photographer.

160
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:33,758
Excellent, wasn't it?

161
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:34,998
Remarkable.

162
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:37,291
They have trained for a month.

163
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:39,835
They chose everything themselves.

164
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:43,089
They chose their own music,
made the costumes, everything.

165
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,028
Is that so?

166
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,078
Bilitis is up next.

167
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,179
Go on, Bilitis.

168
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:51,388
- Go ahead now!
- I'm not ready!

169
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:52,501
Go on now!

170
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,528
Go, go now!

171
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:27,203
The night is so deep...

172
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,123
That it creeps between my eyelids...

173
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,549
You will never find the path.

174
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,828
You'll be lost within the wo...

175
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,021
Excuse me. I can't do this.

176
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,462
It's nothing...

177
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:51,578
- ... just youth.
- It will improve with age.

178
00:19:53,637 --> 00:19:56,546
No, no, no sir!
Be on your way!

179
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,226
Madam, I beg of you...

180
00:19:58,306 --> 00:19:59,973
- Listen to me!
- No!

181
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:01,787
I am not who you think.

182
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,164
- Who are you then?
- I am Frandor.

183
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,912
The son of an Earl! Oh...

184
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,461
- Feeling better?
- But what happened?

185
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,170
- Nothing, nothing, stage fright.
- Stage fright?

186
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,117
Leave me alone, Sabine!

187
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,474
I'm leaving now.

188
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:20,763
I know.

189
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,348
I will miss you.

190
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:25,279
I am Lucas.

191
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:34,443
There! We're ready to leave.

192
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:36,877
Once my wife is ready
to leave these ladies...

193
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:41,797
Come to the front, it's cold.

194
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,906
This is nanny. She knew you
when you were very young.

195
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:29,907
She was there when I was born.
She never leaves me.

196
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:31,795
She wasn't there when I was born.

197
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,203
She didn't know me when I was little.

198
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:37,045
What a handicap.

199
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:42,040
She mustn't weigh much more than she
did ten years ago, but she's bigger now.

200
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,500
I'll give her a kiss and call her "Jij".
Okay?

201
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,663
Okay. You give me a kiss and call me Jij.

202
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:53,966
I used to spend all my holidays
in this room.

203
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,809
When I was a young girl.

204
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:58,437
Do you like it?

205
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:00,486
Yes...

206
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:04,222
... provided I'm not locked up.

207
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,016
Why would we do that?

208
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:12,519
Come.

209
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:21,084
Bilitis...

210
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,474
... your poem, what was it about?

211
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,545
About?

212
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:27,985
Love?

213
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:32,940
Yes, a girl who...

214
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:40,571
Do you learn to ride horses
at your school?

215
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:43,681
Yes, some do, but not me.

216
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,231
Why, is there a reason?

217
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,724
No, I don't know why I don't.

218
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:53,422
Strange. Most girls enjoy riding.

219
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:56,006
- They find it exciting.
- Pierre!

220
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:01,381
- Not hungry?
- No, thank you.

221
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,338
You could do with a little fattening up...

222
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:06,763
Don't you agree, Melissa,
that she should...?

223
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,108
No...?

224
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:13,143
- I am tired, excuse me.
- Would you like a little nightcap?

225
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:16,406
- I'd like a large glass of milk.
- I'll come with you.

226
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:19,021
Excuse me.

227
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:25,017
A glass of milk.

228
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:27,388
Why not a teddy bear?

229
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:39,202
He was teasing you, you know.
He does that frequently...

230
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,717
Too frequently.

231
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:47,705
- He loves horses, doesn't he?
- Oh, it's his passion.

232
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:51,674
He's happy around them.
He's mostly at the riding school.

233
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,245
- Do you live here all year round?
- Yes...

234
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:00,494
Since Pierre bought the riding school.

235
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:07,889
- Do you sleep in the same bed?
- Of course.

236
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:10,717
What a question!
Sleep well.

237
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:21,811
What are you looking at?

238
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,493
At you, darling.
When you were Bilitis' age.

239
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:28,943
You look like her.

240
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:30,662
I don't think so.

241
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:33,085
Say...

242
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:36,030
What's she doing now?

243
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,284
- She certainly likes her milk...
- She is very tired.

244
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:42,620
She will sleep, and so will I.

245
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,724
Pardon me,

246
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,412
I'm not tired.

247
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,354
I undressed to climb a tree,

248
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:35,027
My naked thighs embraced
the smooth and moist bark.

249
00:27:35,107 --> 00:27:38,453
My sandals climbed upon the branches.

250
00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:44,072
High up, but still beneath the leaves
and shaded from the heat,

251
00:27:44,152 --> 00:27:47,366
I straddled a wide-spread fork...

252
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:49,870
and swung my feet into the void.

253
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:55,164
It had rained... Drops of water
fell and flowed down my skin.

254
00:27:55,244 --> 00:27:57,537
My hands were soiled with moss

255
00:27:57,617 --> 00:28:00,728
and my heels were reddened
by the crushed blossoms.

256
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:05,995
I felt the lovely tree living,
when the wind passed through it,

257
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:09,327
so I locked my legs tighter,

258
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:14,287
and squeezed my open lips to
the hairy nape of a bough.

259
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:52,450
- Good morning, Nanny.
- Well, you're up already?

260
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,118
Yes, and the rest?

261
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:58,163
Pierre left early this morning.
You won't see him until tonight.

262
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:00,521
- And Melissa?
- She's taking a bath.

263
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:02,198
There she is.

264
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:08,935
- Good morning, Bilitis.
- Good morning.

265
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:14,305
So you've taken a bath?

266
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:17,745
- Yes, and you?
- I didn't need to.

267
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:22,305
Is it true that your husband
won't be back until tonight?

268
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:26,390
You can call him Pierre.
Yes, he won't be here.

269
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,392
That's good.

270
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:29,427
Now nobody can bother us.

271
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:32,757
What do you have on?

272
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,272
You will put on a bathing suit.

273
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:03,640
What are you waiting for?

274
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:16,278
- Is it that bad?
- It's awful.

275
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,550
I will lend you one of mine.

276
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,021
- On me, it'll still be dreadful.
- Don't be silly, come!

277
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:55,615
Do you have a sister?

278
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:56,834
No.

279
00:30:57,872 --> 00:30:59,472
I wish I had one.

280
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,588
Come, you can't stay like that.

281
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:23,384
The bathing suit is made of wool,
it will never dry.

282
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:26,270
I'm used to it, you know.

283
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,188
That's no reason.
You'll catch a cold.

284
00:31:29,268 --> 00:31:31,076
Take it off.

285
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:36,771
Take it off, there's nobody here.

286
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:40,989
- You are here...
- But, Bilitis...

287
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,945
You could at least help me.

288
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,629
I am horrible.
I look like a boy. So flat.

289
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:06,286
I like you just the way you are.

290
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:16,995
In school, when then I was your age...

291
00:32:17,717 --> 00:32:20,127
In the dormitory,
where the others slept...

292
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:27,453
You hurt me.

293
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:30,851
Does your husband do that to you?

294
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:33,468
Stand up!

295
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:38,953
Listen, stop spying on me, you hear?

296
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,501
- Bilitis...
- Yes?

297
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:07,537
If you have nothing to do tomorrow,
come to the riding school for a lesson.

298
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:10,218
No thanks, I don't like horses.

299
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:12,887
I'm afraid of them.

300
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:18,968
Good, I will go to sleep. Won't you?

301
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:23,114
You forgot your book.

302
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:25,074
A book about love.

303
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:29,857
They no longer love each other
and then they start over.

304
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:32,504
Goodnight.

305
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,226
Ungrateful age...

306
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:41,699
The beautiful age.

307
00:33:43,475 --> 00:33:44,646
Check.

308
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,910
How did they get to
know each other, Nanny?

309
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,426
At a riding school.
He gave lessons there.

310
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,093
Did she really fall in love with him?

311
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:05,086
First with the horse, then him afterwards.

312
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:09,553
I think she made a mistake.
I would have chosen the horse.

313
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,556
Yes. That's something you can't say.

314
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:15,297
To who, the horse, or Melissa?

315
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:17,714
Both, you best keep quiet.

316
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:21,978
All the same...

317
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:26,424
If she was really unhappy...

318
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:28,495
she wouldn't be so beautiful as she is.

319
00:34:32,198 --> 00:34:36,333
Dearest Lucas...

320
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:17,745
No! Not this way! No!

321
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,370
I don't want to...

322
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,248
Just two minutes!

323
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:31,412
Take your time.

324
00:36:42,986 --> 00:36:44,695
Are we going to the beach today?

325
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:48,102
I don't think so.

326
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:51,578
Why aren't we?

327
00:37:05,594 --> 00:37:07,328
I would love to go.

328
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,912
You're going. I'm not.

329
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,492
- Why would I go alone?
- You'll see.

330
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,506
Your husband's a brute!

331
00:37:34,642 --> 00:37:36,551
I told you not to spy on me.

332
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,319
It's this house, you can hear everything.

333
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:43,536
Once more, Bilitis,
it's my business, not yours.

334
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,017
And why do you leave me by myself?

335
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:49,602
With your friend you're not alone.

336
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,569
Which friend?

337
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:54,100
Your boyfriend.

338
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:56,259
Which boyfriend?

339
00:37:58,017 --> 00:38:02,735
Dear Lucas. Now, you don't have
to write anything in your letter.

340
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:07,317
- Lucas?
- That's what I said.

341
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,454
Who's spying on who?

342
00:38:19,517 --> 00:38:21,194
Why are you doing this?

343
00:38:21,274 --> 00:38:23,663
So that you wouldn't
imagine that you are in love.

344
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:26,778
To lose the illusion, to
get a little experience.

345
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:28,637
I still don't get it.

346
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:30,289
I just know that nothing changes.

347
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:21,412
- You want ice cream?
- Yes.

348
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:30,248
Come. The girl wants ice cream.

349
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,088
Pistachio, vanilla, chocolate?

350
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,772
- All.
- All.

351
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,473
- Serve yourself.
- Yes? - Yes.

352
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:01,307
If I understand you...

353
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:04,428
you cannot go out tonight...

354
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,558
not tomorrow and not
the day after tomorrow.

355
00:40:08,638 --> 00:40:10,271
Absolutely not.

356
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:12,601
Why?

357
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:15,621
Melissa won't allow it.

358
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:18,562
Melissa...?

359
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,351
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

360
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:27,534
- You could climb out the window.
- Melissa wouldn't like that.

361
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:31,657
- Now, Bilitis, I'm serious.
- So am I.

362
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:35,453
- That's good!
- I work during the day...

363
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,166
and you can't go out at night...

364
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:42,257
That's like the watchman and his wife.
One wonders when would they have children.

365
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:45,245
Do you think of having children?

366
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:51,018
Wipe your chin.

367
00:40:52,688 --> 00:40:54,409
Good. I don't go to work.

368
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,631
We meet each other during the day.

369
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,731
You'll come by bicycle.

370
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,782
Do I have a bicycle?

371
00:41:02,995 --> 00:41:05,078
The bicycle that you'll get from Melissa.

372
00:41:06,794 --> 00:41:09,468
Why must I ask Melissa for a bicycle?

373
00:41:09,548 --> 00:41:12,182
Bilitis, do you want us to meet?

374
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:14,397
Yes.

375
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:19,694
No. I might want to see you

376
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:23,930
so I'll come by the bicycle
that I'll ask Melissa for.

377
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:30,335
And... other days you ride your
motor bike to the house.

378
00:41:30,415 --> 00:41:33,698
- You have a motor bike?
- Yes.

379
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,186
Agreed? I come some days
and you come the other days, agreed?

380
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:41,287
Agreed.

381
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,685
- Kiss me for the effort.
- No.

382
00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:31,826
This way then.
A kiss, quickly!

383
00:42:32,752 --> 00:42:33,632
There!

384
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:35,371
You've been kissed.

385
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:56,690
- Watch the ducks!
- Quack, quack! The ducks!

386
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,511
- That's Melissa's husband.
- I've seen him at your school.

387
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:25,379
- Did he spend a lot to set this place up?
- It was all paid for by Melissa's father.

388
00:43:28,966 --> 00:43:30,687
He's a good looking man.

389
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,040
He's not my type.

390
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,774
I sure hope not.

391
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:51,737
Should I try to ride in Monte Carlo?

392
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:55,870
Yes, not bad, but Monte Carlo is
rather difficult, you know.

393
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:59,247
Yes, but if I have my teacher
who gives me confidence.

394
00:43:59,327 --> 00:44:00,787
Moral support, I see.

395
00:44:02,012 --> 00:44:03,614
Are you going to Monte Carlo?

396
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:05,915
Not that I know.

397
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:14,908
They will see us,
still I might as well say hello.

398
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,691
You look overjoyed.

399
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:22,870
Do I go, or do I not?

400
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:29,940
Maybe not... look.

401
00:44:38,993 --> 00:44:40,981
See you tomorrow, on your bike.

402
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:42,878
- Yes.
- What bicycle?

403
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:44,962
Wait!

404
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,543
You didn't say goodbye.

405
00:45:01,053 --> 00:45:05,620
Look, Melissa, what do I say?

406
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,029
Nothing. You've never met.

407
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:10,209
Good day, Madam.

408
00:45:21,908 --> 00:45:24,706
A strange manner to drink coffee together.

409
00:45:25,357 --> 00:45:27,279
Please sit down.

410
00:45:28,735 --> 00:45:32,383
I'm going I have to get
the horses ready tonight.

411
00:45:36,161 --> 00:45:38,675
Three days of hanging around
for a chance to win a medal.

412
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:40,378
I find it an awful bore.

413
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:43,115
But if I don't go to the games...

414
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:45,693
You don't need me to
make up your mind for you.

415
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:47,960
Isn't it in Monte Carlo, your show?

416
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:51,483
Yes, how did you know that?

417
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:54,488
I read the newspaper, you know.

418
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,872
Are you going to take us, Melissa and me?

419
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:01,700
Melissa, do you want to come along?

420
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,985
Not as much as you like to have me there.

421
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:07,562
Why are you spinning like that?

422
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,763
She wants to ask you a question.

423
00:46:10,843 --> 00:46:13,175
She's waiting until I'm gone.
Is that right?

424
00:46:13,255 --> 00:46:14,215
Yes.

425
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,793
Goodnight.

426
00:46:28,063 --> 00:46:30,112
You know, this way you
don't have to drive me.

427
00:46:30,192 --> 00:46:31,618
What way?

428
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:34,272
- If I had a bicycle.
- Is that all?

429
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:37,838
He's wonderful, Melissa, he's so nice...

430
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:43,870
Say no more...
you'll have a bicycle.

431
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:47,887
Thank you!

432
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:49,663
You use your tongue,

433
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:52,459
like this, to say thank you?

434
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:53,501
Just with you.

435
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,453
I can't keep up!

436
00:47:08,713 --> 00:47:10,287
That is normal, I'm a man.

437
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:13,287
It's easy for you, you have a motor bike.

438
00:47:13,847 --> 00:47:17,585
This is not so easy.
You don't have one.

439
00:47:35,377 --> 00:47:37,530
- Take my picture.
- I have no camera.

440
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,245
Yes, take my picture.

441
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:42,499
- Okay.
- This way!

442
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,787
You know, Melissa is really wonderful.

443
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:17,745
But she doesn't want me to talk about you.

444
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:19,870
Really?

445
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,839
That makes it difficult,
because I only want to talk about you.

446
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:40,610
- You don't want to?
- Not this way.

447
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:45,038
- How?
- I think...

448
00:48:45,118 --> 00:48:46,240
... softly.

449
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:16,948
That was my first time.

450
00:50:05,355 --> 00:50:06,620
No, not here!

451
00:50:07,686 --> 00:50:11,721
Not here, not now, not this evening!
You make me crazy!

452
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:17,814
I'll see if Bilitis is asleep.
Close the windows and shutters.

453
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,649
- Why?
- She hears us!

454
00:50:21,514 --> 00:50:22,912
She's a pest!

455
00:50:29,922 --> 00:50:31,228
Bilitis.

456
00:50:32,426 --> 00:50:34,381
I don't think I know how to kiss.

457
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:38,883
What do you do after you
stick out your tongue?

458
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:40,078
You'll learn.

459
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,687
- Teach me.
- No.

460
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:46,008
- Please.
- Some other time.

461
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:48,298
No, he will take me for a child.

462
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,628
- Come on.
- No.

463
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,832
- Come on.
- No.

464
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:02,578
- This way?
- Yes.

465
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,078
Am I doing this right?

466
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,687
Melissa, what are you doing up there?

467
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:28,320
- He becomes impatient.
- Yes.

468
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:31,629
- He's going to make love to you?
- Yes.

469
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,376
Can I reach you in Monte Carlo?

470
00:52:17,004 --> 00:52:17,888
Why?

471
00:52:18,758 --> 00:52:21,273
To tell me that you
can't sleep without me?

472
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:28,250
Don't forget the blue chamber.

473
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:31,085
The blue chamber?

474
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:33,090
Yes, he slept there.

475
00:52:33,745 --> 00:52:35,453
I wasn't feeling well.

476
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:39,976
Exactly the day before I leave.
What a coincidence!

477
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,765
I learned a lot of things about him.

478
00:52:44,824 --> 00:52:45,786
What?

479
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,552
What a man is, for example...

480
00:52:50,487 --> 00:52:52,328
Not encouraging.

481
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:56,703
You can rest for three
days and nights without me.

482
00:52:57,693 --> 00:53:00,543
When I think what he's
going to do in Monte Carlo.

483
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:05,140
I can't tell you, Nanny.

484
00:53:18,813 --> 00:53:20,957
Good, I can go.

485
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:30,348
You seem sad that he's gone.

486
00:53:30,428 --> 00:53:34,261
It's not as simple as that.
You'll understand later.

487
00:53:36,218 --> 00:53:39,417
Never mind.
Are you going somewhere?

488
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,372
Now I feel bad if I leave you alone.

489
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:46,612
You're going to anyway.
Lucas?

490
00:53:48,002 --> 00:53:51,380
Have you done anything yet?

491
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,083
Of course not.

492
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,966
That's good.
You have plenty of time for that.

493
00:53:58,972 --> 00:54:01,271
Men aren't all like Pierre.

494
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:05,109
There are some that are
gentle, kind, and nice.

495
00:54:05,189 --> 00:54:07,453
Lucas, perhaps?

496
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:11,952
Yesterday you were lively.
What's wrong?

497
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:15,374
Must I jump for joy because you
told me all Melissa's troubles?

498
00:54:15,454 --> 00:54:19,296
You were in a bad mood when I
arrived even before I said anything.

499
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:22,798
I wasn't in a bad mood, only sad.

500
00:54:22,878 --> 00:54:25,429
Just today when I want to be cheered up.

501
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:27,768
What do you want?
A person can't be funny everyday.

502
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,811
You get on my nerves.

503
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:33,523
I lived with a girl that I just
left because of you.

504
00:54:37,193 --> 00:54:38,703
That is normal...

505
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:44,269
That's extraordinary! Normal!

506
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,257
I'm not very happy!

507
00:54:49,804 --> 00:54:52,935
- You regret it.
- I don't regret it!

508
00:55:05,255 --> 00:55:07,824
Is that your boyfriend, the photographer?

509
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,743
That's none of your business.

510
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:14,084
Your boyfriend and your
problems are none of my business.

511
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:17,382
And I'm not going alone to Monte Carlo.

512
00:55:17,462 --> 00:55:19,497
That's none of your business, okay?

513
00:55:24,262 --> 00:55:26,828
I believe we understand each other.
Good day.

514
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:45,155
I was hoping you would return.

515
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,212
Was that Melissa's husband?

516
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,554
Take me away somewhere please.

517
00:55:50,634 --> 00:55:53,433
- What happened?
- Nothing. Take me away.

518
00:55:53,513 --> 00:55:54,640
Wait.

519
00:56:08,686 --> 00:56:11,741
You're like all the girls.
Let me finish!

520
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:14,213
You always try to make me feel remorseful.

521
00:56:14,293 --> 00:56:15,465
You feel remorseful?

522
00:56:15,545 --> 00:56:17,570
Sometimes, you deserve a beating!

523
00:56:18,634 --> 00:56:19,870
Go ahead, then.

524
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,870
- Bilitis, I'm warning you!
- What are you waiting for?

525
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,172
Enough! Just stop!

526
00:56:27,186 --> 00:56:29,419
You're driving me crazy.

527
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:32,052
You're impossible.

528
00:56:32,528 --> 00:56:34,512
Then you must beat me.

529
00:56:40,248 --> 00:56:41,574
Kiss me.

530
00:56:41,654 --> 00:56:43,647
- Never.
- Yes.

531
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:45,726
- No.
- Yes.

532
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:48,074
- No.
- Yes...

533
00:56:48,975 --> 00:56:50,101
No...

534
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:29,598
You're not going to make love to me?

535
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,007
One does not die from it.

536
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,571
Yes, but I have never...

537
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:50,407
- I've done nothing.
- You call that "nothing".

538
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,637
Almost nothing.

539
00:57:55,408 --> 00:57:58,624
Bilitis... listen.

540
00:57:58,704 --> 00:58:03,303
Listen. It's natural for
a girl and a boy...

541
00:58:03,629 --> 00:58:06,306
If the girl wants the boy, it's normal.

542
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:10,117
Otherwise he'll look at other girls.

543
00:58:11,097 --> 00:58:15,603
Do that, go look!
It makes no difference to me!

544
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:18,376
- It can't make a difference.
- What is it?

545
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:20,912
What is it with her?

546
00:58:23,115 --> 00:58:24,820
A virgin... huh!

547
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:27,893
Melissa!

548
00:58:34,196 --> 00:58:35,203
Come here...

549
00:58:39,702 --> 00:58:41,348
I hate men.

550
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:44,736
You mustn't.

551
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:51,042
You're like me.

552
00:58:54,516 --> 00:58:57,223
- We're made the same.
- Be silent.

553
00:58:57,303 --> 00:59:00,479
You can't hurt me.
I'm happy with you.

554
00:59:01,944 --> 00:59:03,379
You're crazy.

555
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,110
I am Pierre.

556
01:02:22,861 --> 01:02:28,281
Alas, when I think of her,
my throat becomes dry.

557
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:30,566
My head bows down.

558
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:34,298
My breasts harden and ache.

559
01:02:34,378 --> 01:02:38,175
I shudder and weep as I walk.

560
01:02:38,384 --> 01:02:42,552
When I see her, my heart stops.

561
01:02:42,632 --> 01:02:50,049
My hands tremble, my feet turn cold,
my cheeks burn fiery red...

562
01:02:50,602 --> 01:02:53,354
my temples throbbing.

563
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,226
When I touch her, I go mad.

564
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:02,732
My arms stiffen, my knees are weak.

565
01:03:03,037 --> 01:03:07,120
I fall before her and lie waiting
as if a death could take me.

566
01:03:09,096 --> 01:03:12,061
Her every word is a wound to me.

567
01:03:14,576 --> 01:03:17,255
Her love is a torture to me.

568
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:20,833
Strangers passing hear me crying.

569
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,418
Alas...

570
01:03:25,957 --> 01:03:28,579
How may I call on my own beloved?

571
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:37,814
What do you think?

572
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:47,383
Listen. It was strange,
it was gentle, it was beautiful.

573
01:03:47,463 --> 01:03:49,815
But it could never happen again.

574
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,906
- Never again?
- No, never.

575
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:02,902
Okay, you find that you don't. I find...

576
01:04:03,704 --> 01:04:07,213
Nothing. As if it had never happened.

577
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:12,961
You don't need me any more.

578
01:04:29,272 --> 01:04:30,770
You again!

579
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:39,662
I haven't been nice to Bilitis.
So I thought I'd like to see her.

580
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:44,577
Even if you love me more than anyone...

581
01:04:45,796 --> 01:04:47,725
you would still need a man.

582
01:04:50,828 --> 01:04:52,142
Where are you going?

583
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,328
- To find you one.
- What?

584
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:58,068
- A man.
- You're crazy.

585
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:00,539
You only love me when I am.

586
01:05:10,996 --> 01:05:14,068
If anybody calls for me, I'm not here.

587
01:05:18,092 --> 01:05:19,821
She's impossible.

588
01:05:22,911 --> 01:05:26,490
- Where is she going?
- To get me a present.

589
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:31,998
- It's so urgent... that she hurries?
- She thinks so.

590
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:47,473
You didn't handle her very well.

591
01:05:47,553 --> 01:05:49,518
You shouldn't have.

592
01:05:49,598 --> 01:05:51,079
Not like that.

593
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,532
Not right away.

594
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,784
I came to apologise.

595
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,311
She ran away.

596
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,659
Excuse me.

597
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:46,919
- Hello!
- Hello.

598
01:07:51,538 --> 01:07:54,479
- Well, maybe you'll do.
- That would surprise me.

599
01:07:55,398 --> 01:07:57,578
- Let me explain.
- Just leave.

600
01:07:58,231 --> 01:08:01,170
I'm not available.
You're wasting your time.

601
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,609
What will you have?

602
01:08:05,974 --> 01:08:07,551
A glass of milk.

603
01:08:08,933 --> 01:08:12,039
- Do you always act like this?
- Like what?

604
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:15,597
- You're nice.
- Me, nice?

605
01:08:15,932 --> 01:08:19,412
- The same.
- I said I wanted milk.

606
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:24,995
A strange way to meet boys.

607
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:26,783
Oh yes?

608
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,477
Which games do you play?

609
01:08:29,745 --> 01:08:31,912
Let's just forget it.

610
01:08:32,498 --> 01:08:34,620
You could go,
or you could come and sit.

611
01:08:35,982 --> 01:08:38,115
I've been watching you.

612
01:08:38,195 --> 01:08:41,557
The first when you look... zero.

613
01:08:41,637 --> 01:08:43,492
The second... still zero.

614
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,412
You'll never succeed.

615
01:08:46,672 --> 01:08:48,537
I always get what I want.

616
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:55,403
Come.

617
01:08:57,559 --> 01:09:00,608
- What is it?
- The same as mine...

618
01:09:08,998 --> 01:09:11,019
You don't know what you want.

619
01:09:12,627 --> 01:09:15,107
That I know. A lover.

620
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:19,272
Not for me. For a friend.

621
01:09:19,352 --> 01:09:22,662
- To do this... for her.
- For her, nice.

622
01:09:23,429 --> 01:09:27,533
A man who's handsome,
and gentle, and strong.

623
01:09:29,273 --> 01:09:32,537
Who won't ask questions
and goes away afterwards.

624
01:09:33,038 --> 01:09:35,495
And who you find attractive also.

625
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,453
Naturally.

626
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:43,023
She knows what you're looking for.
You should've brought her along.

627
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:47,882
Melissa.

628
01:09:47,962 --> 01:09:49,028
That's her name?

629
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:57,136
Melissa... pick up a man on the street?

630
01:09:57,216 --> 01:09:58,638
Impossible!

631
01:09:59,418 --> 01:10:02,041
- I like you.
- You'll like Melissa even more.

632
01:10:02,713 --> 01:10:06,787
Perhaps... but what you want
is out of the question.

633
01:10:07,547 --> 01:10:08,537
Why?

634
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:11,574
Because...

635
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:22,001
Wait... you're right.

636
01:10:23,008 --> 01:10:25,204
Only she can know.

637
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:29,213
Only she can choose.

638
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:36,232
But, I have no money.

639
01:10:36,614 --> 01:10:38,192
How much do you need?

640
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:44,370
Listen, if a person fights with
someone for some reason,

641
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:47,158
could she speak to him...

642
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:50,961
without going back on the first reason?

643
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:52,380
Do you want money or not?

644
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,890
No, he owes me at least that much.

645
01:10:57,297 --> 01:10:58,598
Excuse me!

646
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:02,455
My name is Nikias.
You can find me at my boat.

647
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,978
Well, well...

648
01:11:16,222 --> 01:11:17,250
No...

649
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:19,537
I'm not coming to see you.

650
01:11:19,897 --> 01:11:22,159
I've decided not to speak to you.

651
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:24,924
So I won't speak to you.

652
01:11:27,602 --> 01:11:33,329
But... you are Mr. Lucas Mercier,
photographer, right?

653
01:11:33,409 --> 01:11:35,788
Yes, that's me.
Welcome!

654
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,244
That...

655
01:11:44,062 --> 01:11:45,606
and that one...

656
01:11:48,147 --> 01:11:49,465
- And that.
- Yes.

657
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:52,345
That...

658
01:11:54,213 --> 01:11:55,454
and this one.

659
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:00,875
Thank you!

660
01:12:01,894 --> 01:12:03,093
Hello, Lucas.

661
01:12:03,173 --> 01:12:05,957
Oh... Mister.

662
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:09,620
Take him.

663
01:12:10,431 --> 01:12:11,776
Nikias!

664
01:12:14,133 --> 01:12:16,063
Sorry... it was a task.

665
01:12:17,892 --> 01:12:19,866
And him, why not take him?

666
01:12:21,316 --> 01:12:22,652
Do you know each other?

667
01:12:22,945 --> 01:12:23,805
Yes.

668
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,849
Why me?

669
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:36,106
No importance. Any left?

670
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:37,463
I have to reload.

671
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:41,846
- ... or do you have enough?
- How many do you have?

672
01:12:43,995 --> 01:12:48,212
That's good.
I guess 50% rejections...

673
01:12:48,292 --> 01:12:49,548
I never miss a photo.

674
01:12:49,628 --> 01:12:52,018
No, not the photos...
some of the places are wrong.

675
01:12:52,098 --> 01:12:54,273
Oh... the places.

676
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:58,316
I didn't hire you to make comments,
only photos, that's it!

677
01:13:01,747 --> 01:13:03,187
Very good.

678
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:10,078
- Do you do want an envelope?
- How much do I owe you?

679
01:13:14,776 --> 01:13:15,949
One kiss.

680
01:13:16,533 --> 01:13:18,208
I already paid. Greetings.

681
01:13:19,722 --> 01:13:25,852
10, 11, 12

682
01:13:27,726 --> 01:13:31,355
13, 14

683
01:13:34,745 --> 01:13:37,684
- Don't you like any of them?
- No.

684
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:42,390
15, 16...

685
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:46,202
I'm afraid your photographer went
through all this trouble for nothing.

686
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,701
What about the photographer, himself?

687
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:51,890
I might not say no to him!

688
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:56,019
- No really?
- You seem hesitant.

689
01:13:57,507 --> 01:14:00,435
No... that's not it...

690
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:02,939
You don't want me to be happy?

691
01:14:03,019 --> 01:14:06,453
- Yes I do!
- Let's continue...

692
01:14:08,356 --> 01:14:12,398
17... 18

693
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:18,037
19...

694
01:14:19,005 --> 01:14:20,953
That's my friend, Nikias.

695
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:23,628
Nikias...?

696
01:14:26,147 --> 01:14:29,353
Even if you like him, you can't have him.

697
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:34,143
- I don't think anyone can.
- Pity.

698
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:41,769
When I try to imagine you with a man,
it's always a different man...

699
01:14:44,505 --> 01:14:47,357
and each time, I can't bear it.

700
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:53,603
With Pierre... it's terrible.

701
01:14:55,004 --> 01:14:57,682
I should never have let you love me.

702
01:14:58,215 --> 01:15:00,466
I would've loved you anyway.

703
01:15:04,807 --> 01:15:07,427
Maybe some I love, it will be different.

704
01:15:10,022 --> 01:15:11,806
For me and for you.

705
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:19,293
- I will persuade him.
- Lucas?

706
01:15:19,784 --> 01:15:21,955
Of course not, Nikias.

707
01:15:22,035 --> 01:15:25,343
- You said, "With someone you love..."
- I don't love Lucas.

708
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:28,622
Not any more.

709
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:33,045
It's as if I never loved him.

710
01:15:49,482 --> 01:15:51,361
Can I invite Nikias here?

711
01:15:51,441 --> 01:15:54,682
But you said to me,
he might not accept.

712
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,736
I can try.

713
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:07,212
- It's important to her, Nikias.
- I don't know her.

714
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:09,250
And it's also important to me.

715
01:16:11,339 --> 01:16:12,385
You did hear me.

716
01:16:12,465 --> 01:16:15,930
Yes, but, I'm only asking
you to come and see her.

717
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,915
We invited some friends and
you could bring some too!

718
01:16:21,774 --> 01:16:24,884
You said you like me, prove it then.

719
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:29,116
- You'll regret it.
- Yes...

720
01:16:30,261 --> 01:16:31,385
Agreed.

721
01:16:31,749 --> 01:16:33,907
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, I'm crazy.

722
01:16:49,881 --> 01:16:52,011
You're crazy, Bilitis.

723
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:55,211
I know. People are always
saying that. Look...

724
01:16:55,706 --> 01:16:57,195
Look...

725
01:16:57,618 --> 01:16:59,537
- Perhaps these?
- No.

726
01:16:59,797 --> 01:17:00,701
No.

727
01:17:01,145 --> 01:17:04,820
Perhaps these? For you.

728
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,958
- For me?
- Perhaps...

729
01:17:09,694 --> 01:17:12,696
Very well... these are for me!

730
01:17:13,346 --> 01:17:17,488
And these are perfect for you.
I know how to do your hair.

731
01:17:18,622 --> 01:17:22,796
It's ridiculous asking all these
friends over at such short notice.

732
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:26,549
Why? We invite them, they accepted.

733
01:17:26,629 --> 01:17:29,346
Nikias will probably bring
some people over too.

734
01:17:29,426 --> 01:17:31,948
We could've postponed it until tomorrow.

735
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:36,690
That's too far away, Melissa...
I couldn't wait that long.

736
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,442
I thought this was for me.

737
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,122
It is for you.

738
01:17:43,398 --> 01:17:45,859
I want you to be beautiful.

739
01:17:46,486 --> 01:17:48,726
Absolutely beautiful.

740
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:40,215
If I was Pierre, I know what I'd do...
with the riding school

741
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:43,578
Pierre is not here?

742
01:18:43,658 --> 01:18:45,078
Monte Carlo, for the game.

743
01:18:58,146 --> 01:18:59,822
Melissa is adorable.

744
01:19:00,917 --> 01:19:02,293
The champagne is delicious.

745
01:19:03,946 --> 01:19:06,141
But what are we doing here?

746
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,507
Isn't she beautiful?

747
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:44,443
I've bathed, dressed,
and fixed her hair.

748
01:19:49,867 --> 01:19:51,958
If I could love her...

749
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,204
I'd have to get rid of you first.

750
01:19:54,871 --> 01:19:56,281
In what way?

751
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:58,683
Kill you.

752
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:37,203
Can I show you the park?

753
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,665
Can I throw everyone here out?

754
01:20:44,897 --> 01:20:47,287
You know why you're here?

755
01:20:48,692 --> 01:20:51,931
Hasn't Bilitis told you that
I'm never somewhere entirely?

756
01:20:52,738 --> 01:20:54,870
Bilitis always exaggerates.

757
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:58,707
Bilitis doesn't know what to expect of me.

758
01:20:59,538 --> 01:21:02,162
She thinks she knows.
That's different.

759
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:09,101
When I arrived, you were dancing.

760
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,977
I was all alone.

761
01:21:16,516 --> 01:21:17,912
And are you now?

762
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:24,184
Who is to decide? You? Me?

763
01:21:26,305 --> 01:21:29,139
Nobody can decide about that.

764
01:22:36,797 --> 01:22:40,444
No, it's not possible.

765
01:22:42,008 --> 01:22:44,769
You know it, and I know it.

766
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:48,010
That's true...

767
01:22:50,107 --> 01:22:51,063
and not true.

768
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,687
Come!

769
01:23:00,798 --> 01:23:03,095
Pity about Nikias...

770
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:04,471
You know...

771
01:23:04,551 --> 01:23:06,753
He doesn't belong with us.

772
01:23:11,371 --> 01:23:13,854
In fact he belongs to nobody.

773
01:23:16,147 --> 01:23:18,753
You look so alone and far away.

774
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:21,944
Melissa, embrace me.

775
01:23:23,775 --> 01:23:25,846
You were to find me a man!

776
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:30,635
Come dance with me.

777
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:51,371
Suppose I asked you to come to my room.

778
01:23:51,451 --> 01:23:53,208
That's foolish. I know you...

779
01:23:53,288 --> 01:23:55,587
And I know myself.

780
01:24:07,346 --> 01:24:08,947
Not him.

781
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:10,544
No.

782
01:24:17,858 --> 01:24:20,318
It's true...
I would've had...

783
01:24:21,946 --> 01:24:24,615
Do something, Nikias...

784
01:24:46,638 --> 01:24:47,942
It's you.

785
01:24:49,324 --> 01:24:50,832
That's what you want.

786
01:24:57,809 --> 01:24:59,411
I didn't invite you.

787
01:25:00,738 --> 01:25:02,562
I thought it was an oversight.

788
01:25:02,642 --> 01:25:04,256
Don't worry about it.

789
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:06,452
Bilitis was hoping you'd come.

790
01:25:15,628 --> 01:25:16,859
Thank you.

791
01:25:41,532 --> 01:25:42,970
Do you still hesitate?

792
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:48,209
Go on!

793
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:52,976
Come...

794
01:26:06,325 --> 01:26:07,533
Lucas.

795
01:26:07,936 --> 01:26:09,078
I know.

796
01:26:10,035 --> 01:26:11,499
We've already met each other.

797
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:27,801
I told you, "It could be someone I love."

798
01:28:38,887 --> 01:28:40,103
Let's go.

799
01:31:17,232 --> 01:31:18,754
Melissa...

800
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,950
Ah... it's you, Nanny.

801
01:31:28,379 --> 01:31:30,198
What's happening here?

802
01:31:31,764 --> 01:31:33,670
What are you thinking about?

803
01:31:36,483 --> 01:31:38,234
Who are you thinking about?

804
01:31:43,402 --> 01:31:44,647
Have you noticed?

805
01:31:47,094 --> 01:31:48,114
She laughs...

806
01:31:50,591 --> 01:31:52,744
She laughs... when she trusts you.

807
01:31:54,349 --> 01:31:55,367
Yes...
