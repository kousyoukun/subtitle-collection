1
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:11,062
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving force
behind Catholicism WOW!, Cardinal Glick.

2
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:20,305
Thank you.

3
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:22,341
Now we all know
how the majority...

4
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,677
and the media in this country...

5
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:27,012
view the Catholic church.

6
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,148
They think of us as a passé,
archaic institution.

7
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:33,486
People find the Bible obtuse...

8
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,019
even hokey.

9
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,188
Now, in an effort to disprove
all that...

10
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:41,026
the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

11
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:43,062
both of faith and of style.

12
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:46,197
For example, the crucifix.

13
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,866
While it has been a time-honored symbol
of our faith...

14
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:52,003
Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

15
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:53,672
this highly recognizable...

16
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:56,074
yet wholy depressing image...

17
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,310
of our Lord, crucified.

18
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,779
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

19
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:03,714
He came to help us out.

20
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:07,484
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

21
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:10,322
that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring Sigil.

22
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:14,325
So, it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

23
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:17,061
of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! campaign...

24
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:20,564
will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

25
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:21,866
"The Buddy Christ."

26
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:34,712
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

27
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,215
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

28
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,682
But look at it.

29
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,585
Doesn't it pop?

30
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,252
Buddy Christ.

31
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,455
Well, there you have it.

32
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,457
Let me get this straight.

33
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:50,094
You don't believe in God
because of Alice in Wonderland?

34
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,196
No, Through the Looking Glass.

35
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:54,231
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

36
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:56,534
that's an indictment
of organized religion.

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,603
The Walrus, with his girth
and his good nature...

38
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:00,704
he obviously represents either Buddha...

39
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:03,807
or with his tusks,
the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

40
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:05,876
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

41
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:08,712
Now, the Carpenter, which is
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

42
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:12,382
who was raised a carpenter's son,
he represents the Western religions.

43
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,952
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

44
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,554
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

45
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:21,425
and then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

46
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:24,428
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

47
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:28,264
that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

48
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:31,068
ensures the destruction
ofone's inner-being.

49
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:33,203
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

50
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:36,140
by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

51
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:39,576
out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

52
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:42,613
who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

53
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:46,616
and says, " Do it--
Do it and I'll fuckin´ spank you!"

54
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:48,050
Oh,Jesus!

55
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:51,687
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

56
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,091
What have I been doing
with my life?

57
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:58,562
- What am I?
- Yeah, I know.

58
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:00,464
Listen, my advice to you...

59
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,065
you take this money that you've
been collecting for your parish...

60
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:06,368
go get yourself a nice dress,
fix yourself up.

61
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,672
Find some man-- find some woman--you
can connect with, even for a moment...

62
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:12,809
'cause that's really all life is,
Sister-- a series of moments.

63
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:15,912
Why don't you seize yours?

64
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:20,549
That a girl.

65
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,492
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

66
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:33,396
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

67
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:36,299
You've been in His presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

68
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:39,602
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy, man.

69
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:43,105
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

70
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:45,107
Here's what I don't get about you.

71
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:47,943
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

72
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,480
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

73
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:51,748
Look at them.

74
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:55,685
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

75
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:59,688
forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

76
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:01,023
See those two?

77
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,393
What that guy doesn't know is that the
girl cheated on him while she was away.

78
00:06:04,460 --> 00:00:00,000
- She did?
- Twice.

79
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,597
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

80
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:11,633
'cause they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

81
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:13,968
I like that.

82
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:16,339
I wish they all could
feel that way more often.

83
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,575
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

84
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:22,077
You call me, you tell me
it's important.

85
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:25,580
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

86
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,716
We're going home.

87
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:30,085
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

88
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,027
Take it and quit leering at me. People
will think I just broke up with you.

89
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:41,530
- You said we're going home, didn't you?
- Read.

90
00:06:41,597 --> 00:06:45,567
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

91
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,136
And?

92
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:50,905
You have to keep reading.

93
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:53,075
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church..."

94
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,577
...is the kick off of a new campaign
which seeks to bring...

95
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:57,478
Catholicism into the mainstream.

96
00:06:57,546 --> 00:07:00,048
With a papal sanction,
the arch way entrance...

97
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:02,617
of the century-old Jersey shore
house of worship...

98
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:05,087
will serve as a passage way
of plenary indulgence--

99
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:08,490
a little-known Catholic belief offering
all that passes throug hits arches...

100
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:10,425
a morally cleans late.

101
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:13,628
For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

102
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:17,198
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

103
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:20,769
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

104
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:23,470
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

105
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,341
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

106
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:30,478
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

107
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,379
What then, Hell?
Fuck that.

108
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:34,382
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

109
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:37,885
and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

110
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:40,422
If we die with clean souls,
there's no way they can keep us out.

111
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:43,591
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

112
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:47,095
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

113
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:50,231
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loop hole.

114
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,265
He can't keep us out anymore.

115
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,268
Once we're back in,
it'll be forgive and forget.

116
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:56,403
But this thing,
this is Church law.

117
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,373
It's not Divine Mandate.

118
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,009
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:05,546
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:09,150
by the Son of God
before He left was...

121
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,453
- "Whatever you hold true on Earth--"
- "I'll hold true in Heaven."

122
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:15,557
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

123
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:17,291
This thing has a papal sanction--

124
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:20,293
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

125
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,296
never yielded positive results.

126
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,431
You can't be anal retentive
ifyou don't have an anus.

127
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:26,801
Outstanding work!

128
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:29,771
There'sjust one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

129
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:31,939
This is gonna help us get back
on His good side.

130
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:33,174
What?

131
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:36,143
Here. I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

132
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,677
" Mooby, the Golden Calf.

133
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:40,514
Creating an Empire
Out of Simplicity."

134
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,482
I wanna hit 'em.

135
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,285
You really are
just a simple creature.

136
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,654
We finally find a way back
and you want to jeopardize that...

137
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:49,790
because you've got a soft spot
for the good old days.

138
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,327
What betterway to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

139
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:54,895
thanks to you?

140
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:58,031
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

141
00:08:58,131 --> 00:09:01,033
Killing spree?
I'm talking about Divine Justice here.

142
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,438
I'm talking about reigning down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

143
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,107
He's all about that.
I know He'd want this done.

144
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:09,909
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
sinceyou quit.

145
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:11,544
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

146
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:14,513
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

147
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,183
If i'm wrong-- which I'm not--
it's not gonna matter.

148
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:19,552
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

149
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:22,455
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

150
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:26,225
Well, He does hate competition.
I will say that.

151
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,594
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

152
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:30,663
Where is this church
we have to go to?

153
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:34,067
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

154
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:36,102
Last four days on Earth?

155
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:38,539
If I had a dick,
I'd go get laid.

156
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,706
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

157
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:42,675
Let's kill people.

158
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,309
Oh, not you.

159
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:54,787
The greater Illinois Chapter
of the Right to Life Foundation...

160
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,189
will be holding its
biannual softball game...

161
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,724
against the Cook County...

162
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,194
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2:00.

163
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,663
Today's second collection
will be donated...

164
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,566
to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.

165
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:09,001
For those of you
who haven't been following the news...

166
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,137
an unidentified homeless man...

167
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:15,341
who was accosted and severely beaten
at the NewJersey shore last Tuesday...

168
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:19,544
ies in critical, but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

169
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:21,446
He lacks identification...

170
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:24,984
and police have had no luck tracking
down any possible family.

171
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:29,488
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

172
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:32,792
to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

173
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:35,594
asking that Catholics
all over the country...

174
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:38,763
join in this protest against euthanasia.

175
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,267
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

176
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,807
We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty...

177
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:50,409
Maker of Heaven and Earth.

178
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,579
We believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, Our Lord--

179
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:56,548
Choose life!

180
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,051
You're gonna burn in Hell,
ya fuckin´ baby killer!

181
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,953
Holy shit. It's the pope.

182
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,422
- Huh?
- Where?

183
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,823
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,769
Jesus! You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

185
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,971
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

186
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:22,941
At least you have an excuse. You're
Jewish. You don't know any better.

187
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,478
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

188
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:28,613
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

189
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:30,082
I went to church.

190
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,083
That still kills me,
you and church.

191
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,653
If only they knew your weekly tithing
came from a Planned Parenthood check.

192
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:38,189
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

193
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:43,060
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

194
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,397
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

195
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:48,899
I don't think I have any faith left.

196
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,104
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

197
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:58,576
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have baby-sat for in high school.

198
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:01,011
The point is,
he told me something.

199
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,615
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

200
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:06,685
When you'reyoung, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

201
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:08,685
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

202
00:12:08,752 --> 00:12:10,754
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it anymore.

203
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,691
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

204
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,659
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

205
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:16,961
In more ways than one.

206
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:21,465
You need to get laid, Bethany Sloane.
You need a man, if only for 10 minutes.

207
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,368
It's been my experience that
the average male is never a man...

208
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:26,837
not even for ten minutes
in his entire life span.

209
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:29,840
That sounds militant. are you thinking
of joining the other side?

210
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:31,809
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

211
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,079
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

212
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:37,080
I think God is dead.

213
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:39,583
The sign of a true Catholic.

214
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,397
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

215
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:55,131
I'm from the EPA.

216
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:59,169
We're checking on possible
freon leaks.

217
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,572
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

218
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:03,306
Yes, we have central air.

219
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:05,008
In every room?

220
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:06,909
Except the bathroom.
Why?

221
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:08,979
Well, you do know
what that means, don't you?

222
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:21,925
Move!

223
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:32,168
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

224
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,238
than central air.

225
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,074
Pick that up.

226
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:45,381
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

227
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:48,351
Now, ifl remember
the protocol correctly...

228
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:49,852
the powers...

229
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:53,323
will attempt to contact
the last scion.

230
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:55,524
I need you three...

231
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,728
to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

232
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:03,867
Go.

233
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,569
Behold the Metatron!

234
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:43,439
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true God!

235
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:46,208
Behold the Metatron!

236
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:50,312
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true God!

237
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,797
Sweet Jesus!
do you have to use the whole can?

238
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,868
Who the fuck are you and
what the fuck are you doing in my room?

239
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:15,804
I'm the one that's soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

240
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,840
Stupid fucking--

241
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:20,241
Get the fuck out of here,
now!

242
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:22,911
Or you'll do what exactly?

243
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,180
Hit me with that fish?

244
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:33,054
Now,just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

245
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:35,724
Jesus wept!

246
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:37,592
Look at my suit.

247
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:41,496
Just take whatever you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

248
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:45,967
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are il-equipped.

249
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:49,637
See?

250
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,177
I'm as anatomically-impaired
as a Ken doll.

251
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:58,412
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

252
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,916
You bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

253
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:04,653
You think everybody'sjust trying
to get in your knickers.

254
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:06,320
What are you?

255
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,423
I'm pissed off is what I am.

256
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:12,560
Do you drench everyone who comes in your
room with flame-retardant chemicals?

257
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,530
No wonder you're single.

258
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:20,734
Stand back.

259
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,079
As I was sayin´...

260
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,416
prior to your fire-fighting episode...

261
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:38,952
I am the Metatron.

262
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:44,458
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell?

263
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:47,695
You people.

264
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:50,964
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

265
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,968
I am a seraphim.

266
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,673
The highest choir ofangels.

267
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,911
You do know what an angel is,
don'tyou?

268
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:08,581
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

269
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:12,919
Any documented occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

270
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:14,721
they're speaking to me.

271
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:16,957
Or they're talking to themselves.

272
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:21,161
Why doesn't God speak for Himself?

273
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:25,432
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

274
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:28,735
human beings have neither the aural,
nor the psychological capacity...

275
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:33,240
to with stand the awesome power
ofGod's true voice.

276
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,776
Wereyou to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

277
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:39,713
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

278
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:43,617
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

279
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:48,021
Aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wing span?

280
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:52,759
You want more proof?

281
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:54,495
Fine.

282
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:55,694
How about tequila?

283
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:06,973
-Where the hell are we?
-Only place you can go for good tequila.

284
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,108
Dos tequilas, por favor,
and an empty glass.

285
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,913
We're in Mexico?

286
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,415
Actually, we're in a franchised
Mexican family eatery...

287
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:18,718
down the street
from your apartment, but...

288
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:20,653
it's impressive none the less.

289
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:25,358
You don't mind I lost the wings, do you?
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

290
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,259
What do you want with me?

291
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:33,733
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

292
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,102
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

293
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:39,538
Noah was a drunk.
Lookwhat he accomplished.

294
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:43,509
And no one's asking you to build an ark.
All you gotta do is go to New Jersey...

295
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:46,111
and visit a small church
on a very important day.

296
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:51,884
New Jersey?

297
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:55,154
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

298
00:18:55,254 --> 00:18:57,756
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

299
00:18:57,857 --> 00:18:59,891
What's the fine print?

300
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:03,929
Stop a couple of angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

301
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:06,164
Wait, wait, wait.
Repeat that.

302
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:09,534
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

303
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,738
and thus negating all existence.

304
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:15,140
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

305
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:17,042
You might want to clarify that.

306
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:22,480
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

307
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:24,650
And His wrath was bore...

308
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,987
by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

309
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:30,188
When Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed...

310
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:31,757
that was Loki.

311
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:35,894
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

312
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:38,730
that was Loki--
and he was good at what he did.

313
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,565
But one day...

314
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:43,602
he refused to bear God's wrath
any longer.

315
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:47,172
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

316
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:49,274
a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

317
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:50,475
Grigori?

318
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:53,811
One of the choirs  of angels.
They're called Watchers.

319
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:55,313
Guess what they do.

320
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,818
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the first born of Egypt--

321
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:02,353
The Tenth Plague.

322
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:05,256
Tell a person that you're the Metatron
and they stare at you blankly.

323
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:07,391
Mention something out of
a Charlton Heston movie...

324
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:09,627
and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

325
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:11,663
May I continue uninterrupted?

326
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,798
Once he's done with the first born...

327
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:18,603
Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

328
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,005
And over many rounds...

329
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:23,174
they get into
this discussion about...

330
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,177
whether or not murder
in the name of God is okay.

331
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:26,610
And in the end...

332
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:30,615
Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

333
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:33,017
and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

334
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:34,651
So...

335
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,556
very inebriated...

336
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,258
Loki tells God he quits...

337
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,661
throws down his fiery sword...

338
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:45,663
and gives Him the finger.

339
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:48,932
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

340
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:52,036
God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

341
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:53,604
Hence all the spitting.

342
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:56,073
So, for their insolence...

343
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,143
God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

344
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,779
would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

345
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,747
- Were they sent to Hell?
- Worse.

346
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:05,749
Wisconsin...

347
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:08,752
for the entire span
of human history.

348
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:11,956
And when the world ends, they'll have to
sit outside the gates for all eternity.

349
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:14,024
And this has what to do with me?

350
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:18,629
Someone has clued them in
to a loop hole in Catholic dogma...

351
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:21,297
that would allow them
to reenter Heaven.

352
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:24,067
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

353
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,070
It's not that simple.

354
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:30,207
If they get in,
they will have reversed God's decree.

355
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:34,844
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

356
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:40,017
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

357
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:43,753
function solely on one principle--

358
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:46,856
God is infallible.

359
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:48,892
To prove Him wrong...

360
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,929
would undo reality
and everything that is.

361
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:54,898
Up would become down,
blackwould become white.

362
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,934
Existence would become nothingness.

363
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:59,569
In essence...

364
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,140
if they're allowed to enter
that church...

365
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,944
they'll unmake the world.

366
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:10,946
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

367
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:13,783
- Why doesn't God do something about it?
- He could.

368
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,954
But He'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

369
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:18,654
Why me?

370
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,057
Because of who you are.

371
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:22,992
And who am I?

372
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,161
The girl in the pj's!

373
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,932
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

374
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:31,034
I'm gonna have to pass.

375
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,102
I beg your pardon?

376
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:37,640
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

377
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:39,308
When my husband decided...

378
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,844
he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear his children...

379
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:43,212
where was God?

380
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:46,916
To Hell with Him.

381
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:51,220
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

382
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,589
just because you've got a grudge
against your Creator.

383
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:56,092
So you lost the ability
to make life.

384
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:59,628
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

385
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:02,031
by acting like one
and protecting it--

386
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:04,033
saving it!

387
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:08,504
But I can't make you.

388
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:12,208
However, ifyou should decide
to stop being selfish...

389
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,777
and accept your responsibility...

390
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:16,779
you won't be alone.

391
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,213
You'll have support.

392
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,349
What? More angels?

393
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,017
Prophets.

394
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,989
In a manner of speaking.
Two of'em.

395
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:32,060
The one who speaks...

396
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,697
and he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not...

397
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:37,799
will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

398
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,368
The other one...

399
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,136
well, he's the quiet type.

400
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:43,439
Look, I've gotta go.

401
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,874
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

402
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:51,480
What's He like?

403
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,547
God?

404
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:56,251
Lonely...

405
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,254
but funny.

406
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,454
He's got a great sense of humor.

407
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,490
Take sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

408
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:05,194
than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

409
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:07,228
Sex is a joke in Heaven?

410
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:11,132
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

411
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:12,467
I'll see ya.

412
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:18,358
Snootch to the motherfucking nootch!

413
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:57,896
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

414
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:01,500
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

415
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:05,204
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pube-less asses!

416
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,512
I don't know what to say
or think, except--

417
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,547
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

418
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:18,850
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

419
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:21,820
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

420
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:24,390
I don't know who those kids were,
but they would have kicked yours...

421
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,426
and Lunchbox's asses
ifl hadn't represented.

422
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:30,329
Thanks for being
out here so late.

423
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:32,564
Wait a minute.
Are you protestors?

424
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:35,635
You mean those dick heads with the signs
and pictures of dead babies?

425
00:27:35,735 --> 00:27:38,204
Shit no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

426
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:40,238
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

427
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:42,275
But what are you doing
hanging around?

428
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:44,375
We're here to pick up chicks.

429
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:46,211
Excuse me?

430
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:49,415
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

431
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:52,284
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

432
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:55,253
Right.

433
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:58,156
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

434
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:00,126
- I think.
- Wait a second.

435
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:02,760
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

436
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:03,929
What the shit is that?

437
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:07,932
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

438
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,970
I think I should go home,
take some Perco sets and lay down.

439
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:15,773
Now how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

440
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:18,377
I'm goin´ back to Jersey
and startin´ up the business again.

441
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:22,314
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

442
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,950
Prophets. Two of'em.

443
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,720
- You know what I'm sayin´, Silent Bob?
- You gotta be kidding me.

444
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:31,489
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

445
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:34,192
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

446
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:35,727
Try it on.

447
00:28:36,794 --> 00:28:41,098
It's a lot more compact than the flaming
sword, but not nearly as impressive.

448
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:44,469
It doesn't have that
"Wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

449
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:48,639
How am I supposed to strike fear into
hearts of the wicked with this thing?

450
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,807
Look at this.

451
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:54,612
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

452
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,649
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

453
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:59,918
You got to stand there and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

454
00:29:00,017 --> 00:29:01,952
I had to do all the work.

455
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,290
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

456
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:07,925
I rained down sulfur.
There's a subtle difference.

457
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:09,727
Okay, I'm sure.

458
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:13,864
Fuck you. Any moron with a pack
of matches can set a fire.

459
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,900
Raining down sulfur
is like an endurance trial.

460
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,602
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can engage in...

461
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:20,237
next to soccer.

462
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:23,474
I'll take this one.

463
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:40,357
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or are you gonna do us both?

464
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,860
lf so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

465
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:44,929
You're a man of principle.

466
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:48,633
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

467
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:51,201
Some fuck named John Hughes.

468
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:52,970
Sixteen Candles John Hughes?

469
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:57,274
You know that guy too?
That fuckin´ guy.

470
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:00,110
He made this flick Sixteen Candles.
Not bad.

471
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:02,413
There's tits in it, but no bush.

472
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:05,081
But Ebert over here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

473
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:07,585
because he's like in love
with this John Hughes guy.

474
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:09,786
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

475
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:14,324
Fuckin´ Breakfast Club, where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

476
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:18,195
Fuckin´ WeirdScience, where this babe
wants to undress and get down...

477
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:21,431
but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

478
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:25,669
And then Prettyin Pink, which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

479
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:29,139
because when the redhead hooks up
with her dream guy...

480
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:32,709
he starts sobbin´ like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

481
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:36,046
And there's nothing worse
than watchin´ a fuckin´ fat man weep.

482
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,081
What exactly brought you
to Illinois?

483
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:42,051
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

484
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,223
where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

485
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:49,292
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fuckin´ harsh.

486
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:50,660
But best of all...

487
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:52,829
there was no one dealin´, man.

488
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,398
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

489
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:57,767
if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

490
00:30:57,834 --> 00:31:00,970
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

491
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,140
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

492
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,143
There is no Shermer, Illinois.

493
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:09,178
Movies are fuckin´ bullshit.

494
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:13,216
- When are you going back to New Jersey?
- This broad asks a lot of questions.

495
00:31:13,316 --> 00:31:16,452
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

496
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:18,421
Yeah. So you do anal?

497
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,989
Is it true that chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

498
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,992
I didn't ask you out for sex.

499
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:24,994
I'll take head.

500
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:30,966
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this.

501
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:35,504
I think I should go with you.

502
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:38,507
Like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

503
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:42,577
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

504
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:45,481
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

505
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:46,615
Really?

506
00:31:46,715 --> 00:31:48,784
You're going to lead me somewhere.

507
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:50,519
Me lead you?

508
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,588
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

509
00:31:53,655 --> 00:31:56,625
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

510
00:31:56,726 --> 00:32:00,762
Someone told me I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I was supposed to go.

511
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:02,831
What the hell are you babbling about?

512
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:05,601
We saved your ass from
some angry fuckin´ dwarves...

513
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:09,472
and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

514
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:13,176
Do you believe in God?

515
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:17,912
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

516
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,915
and we gotta get the oneJesus freak?

517
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,217
- Let's get the fuck out ofhere.
- Wait.

518
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:22,984
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

519
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:25,387
Pay?

520
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:30,025
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

521
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:34,162
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

522
00:32:34,263 --> 00:32:37,732
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

523
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:40,235
and we're in that fucked-up bar!

524
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:41,804
What about sex?

525
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:43,237
No sex.

526
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:49,177
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

527
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:52,714
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

528
00:32:52,814 --> 00:32:54,815
In that highly unlikely situation?

529
00:32:58,219 --> 00:32:59,387
Yeah, sure.

530
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:02,524
She's a slut.

531
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,427
All right.

532
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:10,031
But I get to drive.

533
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:21,610
What gear are you in?

534
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:22,843
Gear?

535
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:34,388
What do I know about shiftin´?

536
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:39,661
Like I ever drove before.

537
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:46,434
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

538
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,902
New Jersey.

539
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:50,071
Maybe you're wrong
about this slaughter thing.

540
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:54,275
How can you be sure what incurs the
Lord's wrath these days? Times change.

541
00:33:54,374 --> 00:33:58,078
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a Hell-worthy trespass.

542
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,648
The major sins never change.

543
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:06,821
Besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker from a mile away.

544
00:34:06,887 --> 00:34:08,756
Bet on it.

545
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:11,525
This from the guy who still owes me
ten bucks over that bet...

546
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,795
about which was gonna be the bigger
movie-- ET or Krush Groove.

547
00:34:14,895 --> 00:34:17,964
Fuck you, man,
'cause time's gonna tell on that one.

548
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:25,104
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

549
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:26,740
Insinuating, no.

550
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,375
Flat-out telling you.

551
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:34,481
Right there.
There's one.

552
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:36,984
So? They're kissing.

553
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,018
Adultery.

554
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:40,387
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

555
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,421
You are just a simple creature.

556
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:45,058
- Am I right?
- I happen to know the truth.

557
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:48,161
I'm not gonna tell you. I want to see
how boned up on the job you are.

558
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:51,064
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

559
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,800
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

560
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,202
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

561
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:59,039
Okay. It's a good thing
you were never...

562
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:02,075
the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

563
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:06,046
" No married man kisses
his wife like that"? Are you stoned?

564
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,180
Excuse me.

565
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,451
Are you married?

566
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:13,353
Why?

567
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:14,887
I'm just curious.

568
00:35:14,954 --> 00:35:17,257
What do you think?

569
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:28,267
- What?
- To her?

570
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,402
- What?
- are you married to her?

571
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:33,939
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

572
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,842
Why?

573
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,621
Whose house

574
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:25,190
Run's house

575
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:27,859
I said, whose house

576
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,895
Run's house

577
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,063
Whose house
Say what

578
00:36:32,163 --> 00:36:34,499
Run's house
Say what

579
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,401
Martin

580
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,275
She's fuckin´ pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

581
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,343
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

582
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:47,613
Let me know how she is.

583
00:36:47,712 --> 00:36:50,582
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

584
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:53,685
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

585
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:57,021
but being that I've decided to go home,
and not to NewJersey...

586
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:59,557
sorry for the inconvenience
and good-bye.

587
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:01,827
You're breaking up with us?

588
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:05,497
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

589
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:08,533
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

590
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:11,936
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

591
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:15,106
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fuckin´ sky.

592
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:26,785
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky.

593
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,433
No heartbeat.

594
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:45,103
Think someone threw him out of a plane
with a message written on him...

595
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:46,704
like in Con Air?

596
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:49,474
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

597
00:37:49,574 --> 00:37:52,210
- Con Air? Con Shit.
- Kill it!

598
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,379
- Sounds familiar.
-Jesus, are you okay?

599
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,548
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

600
00:37:57,648 --> 00:37:59,917
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!.

601
00:37:59,984 --> 00:38:02,854
What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

602
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,991
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

603
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:09,560
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

604
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:12,396
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

605
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:16,900
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand?

606
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,303
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find my own threads?

607
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,441
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

608
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:28,912
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside ofyour armor.

609
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:31,315
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

610
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:34,684
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

611
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:37,254
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

612
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,290
the impact with which you hit
the asphalt would have liquefied you.

613
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:42,092
Death is a worry of the living.

614
00:38:42,192 --> 00:38:45,661
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

615
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:48,632
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

616
00:38:48,698 --> 00:38:49,699
I died.

617
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:52,002
Christ told me the secret
to the resurrection once.

618
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:55,672
We were at this wedding in Caanan.
I got drunk and forgot it.

619
00:38:55,772 --> 00:38:57,541
Wait, wait, wait.

620
00:38:57,608 --> 00:38:59,509
Christ?

621
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:01,645
You knew Christ?

622
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:03,780
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

623
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,715
Let me guess.

624
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:08,285
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

625
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:11,221
I'm a man,just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

626
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:12,889
At least I was a man.

627
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,092
Been dead nearly 2,000 years.
Here, check this out.

628
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,430
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rockin´ the ganj.

629
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,699
It's not a joint.

630
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:25,101
I can't read this.

631
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:30,239
It's Aramaic. It says,
" Rufus, see you in two years.Jesus."

632
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:33,443
Freaked me out because He basically
told me when my number was up.

633
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:36,379
Took all the flavor out of the
remaining years. We gotta get moving.

634
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:40,083
Let's saywe continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit. Come on.

635
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:42,719
I'm starvin´.
Back off, Kato.

636
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:44,053
Wait a second!

637
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:47,857
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

638
00:39:47,957 --> 00:39:49,992
and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

639
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:53,061
I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

640
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:56,598
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where the hell you came from.

641
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:58,601
Me? I came from Heaven.

642
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:00,168
Now let's start walkin´.

643
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:03,106
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

644
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:07,375
Hey, man, back in the old days
withJ.C., we used to walk everywhere.

645
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:09,746
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

646
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,586
What the hell's an apostle?

647
00:40:40,342 --> 00:40:41,644
Let me get this straight.

648
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,979
She's already met the prophets...

649
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:46,147
and the apostle's with them?

650
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:51,353
I think that our best course
of action...

651
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:54,956
is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

652
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:59,628
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

653
00:41:01,296 --> 00:41:03,899
well, I'm left with no choice...

654
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:08,036
but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

655
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:13,541
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

656
00:41:16,678 --> 00:41:19,114
I appreciate the loan, brother.
You can have that back.

657
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:22,550
Man, I remember when all we used to have
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

658
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:25,086
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

659
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:28,289
Now, how ´bout you start explaining
some things, like for starters...

660
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:29,824
how did you know
where to find us?

661
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:32,127
Do you know what the dead do
with most of their time?

662
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:35,096
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

663
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:36,764
I can't wait to die.

664
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:38,699
And why are you watching me?

665
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:41,335
Because you're the one who's gonna
help me get some changes made...

666
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:43,104
in that book
you put so much stock in.

667
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:45,540
- Hustler?
- The Bible!

668
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:48,943
- What's your beefwith the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

669
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,579
Neither are any of us, but you
don't hear us bitchin´ and moanin´.

670
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,116
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th Apostle.

671
00:41:56,683 --> 00:42:00,754
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th Apostle.

672
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:03,591
But you heard of
the other 12 Apostles.

673
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:07,295
They were all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

674
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:09,897
And why is that?
'cause I'm a black man.

675
00:42:09,998 --> 00:42:12,033
Butyou know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

676
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:16,570
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing your faith on.

677
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,207
- What's that?
-Jesus wasn't white.Jesus was black.

678
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:21,442
I don't buy it.

679
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:25,712
If that's true, why did He get
written about and you were left out?

680
00:42:25,812 --> 00:42:28,015
Well, He is the Son ofGod.

681
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:30,251
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

682
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:33,153
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

683
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,823
Leaving me out is okay 'cause you
still got 1 2 white boys to choose from.

684
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:40,527
- are you gonna listen to this shit?
- That's what people of Antioch said...

685
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:42,463
right before they stoned my ass.

686
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,663
You were martyred?

687
00:42:43,763 --> 00:42:45,699
That's one way of puttin´ it.

688
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:48,770
Anotherway is to say I was bludgeoned
to shit by big fucking rocks.

689
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,639
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit--

690
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:54,041
life eternal,
a place in God's Heaven.

691
00:42:54,107 --> 00:42:56,643
But as soon as you hear
that you're gettin´ this good shit...

692
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,411
from a black Jesus, ya freak.

693
00:42:58,512 --> 00:43:00,747
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

694
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:05,485
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't beyour savior.

695
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:06,921
You gonna eat that hash brown?

696
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,923
So, you went to Heaven?

697
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,226
Damn right I went to Heaven!
That's the least He could do.

698
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:16,763
In the three years I followed His ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

699
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:19,966
Hell no.
And I was in my prime.

700
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:22,535
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds´ daughters...

701
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:25,172
not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

702
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,206
She had a thing for dark meat,
if you follow me.

703
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:30,476
Maybe this is just me talking,
but ifl were in Heaven...

704
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:33,513
I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as they got the message right.

705
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:35,683
The message is what counts.

706
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:39,586
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be color blind.

707
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:42,689
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

708
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,724
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

709
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:48,494
That's why I'm gonna help you stop those
angels from gettin´ into that church...

710
00:43:48,594 --> 00:43:51,164
in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

711
00:43:51,263 --> 00:43:54,000
How do you know about that,
the angels?

712
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,204
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

713
00:43:57,304 --> 00:44:01,607
When you were five, you let a kid
from next door piss on your hand.

714
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:05,078
You did that shit?
You're nasty.

715
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:07,647
I never told anybody about that.

716
00:44:07,747 --> 00:44:09,415
Neither did he.

717
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:12,351
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

718
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:15,087
His name was Brian Johnson.

719
00:44:15,187 --> 00:44:17,290
Your exploits,
no matter how inane...

720
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:19,425
are well documented in Heaven.

721
00:44:19,525 --> 00:44:21,359
Probably Hell too.

722
00:44:26,565 --> 00:44:28,167
Where are you going?

723
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,102
Tell me somethin´ about me.

724
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,138
You masturbate more than anyone
on the planet.

725
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:36,108
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

726
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:38,643
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

727
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,917
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

728
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,957
Two-thirds ofme wants to
forget about this and go home.

729
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,627
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
God even existed.

730
00:44:54,727 --> 00:44:58,196
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

731
00:44:58,297 --> 00:45:02,168
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

732
00:45:02,234 --> 00:45:06,939
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

733
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:12,610
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

734
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,383
Where did those two assholes go?

735
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,969
What are you doing?

736
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,071
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

737
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:42,140
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

738
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,575
We gotta get movin´.
How can we get to Jersey?

739
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,645
We'll take the train.
I'll call for reservations.

740
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:46,470
I thought she looked familiar.

741
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,139
- Who?
- Serendipity.

742
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,553
Morning, shoppers.

743
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,388
Good morning.

744
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:07,757
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

745
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,661
We creamed 'em.

746
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:16,000
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me--

747
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:20,504
Do I smell onions?

748
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,311
Excuse me.

749
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,184
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

750
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:38,088
You may proceed, monami.

751
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,693
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

752
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:46,729
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

753
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,365
Oh, come on!

754
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:53,636
Relax. I'm doing it.

755
00:47:55,438 --> 00:47:57,907
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

756
00:47:58,007 --> 00:48:02,411
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarden teacher in 1989.

757
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:05,214
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991 .

758
00:48:05,314 --> 00:48:09,085
Broadcast nationally
as the " Mooby Fun-Time Hour."

759
00:48:09,151 --> 00:48:13,623
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

760
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,693
16 records,
8 prime-time specials...

761
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:22,364
and a library
of priced-to-own video cassettes.

762
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:26,402
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

763
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:29,038
dubbed " Mooby World."

764
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,474
Did I miss anything?

765
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,276
You forgot Mooby Magazine.

766
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:34,810
Damn it!

767
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:36,578
Is there a point to this?

768
00:48:36,678 --> 00:48:40,415
You and your board are idolaters.

769
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:45,354
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

770
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,024
That's you.

771
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:52,461
do you know much about voodoo?

772
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:57,233
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

773
00:48:57,332 --> 00:49:00,035
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

774
00:49:00,135 --> 00:49:02,104
the most well-known ofwhich...

775
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:03,706
is the voodoo doll.

776
00:49:03,806 --> 00:49:05,274
You see...

777
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:16,618
a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

778
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:18,821
to various pokes and prods.

779
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:23,025
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

780
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,659
Call security, now!

781
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:32,100
All lines are currently down.

782
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,569
- I'm gonna have to apologize--
- Would you knock it off?

783
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:37,105
You're doing it again.
Stop. What did we talk about?

784
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,609
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

785
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:43,645
which draws worship
from the Lord.

786
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:46,014
You have broken
the First Commandment.

787
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,050
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one ofyou...

788
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,887
passes for a decent human being.

789
00:49:51,987 --> 00:49:56,424
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

790
00:49:56,491 --> 00:49:58,426
Like you, Mr. Burton.

791
00:49:58,494 --> 00:50:01,964
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years 8 times.

792
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:04,264
You even had sex
with her best friend...

793
00:50:04,365 --> 00:50:08,703
while you were supposed to be home
watching the kids.

794
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,240
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

795
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,441
Mr. Newman.

796
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:16,244
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

797
00:50:16,344 --> 00:50:18,646
and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

798
00:50:18,712 --> 00:50:21,216
to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

799
00:50:21,315 --> 00:50:23,919
just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

800
00:50:24,018 --> 00:50:26,387
when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

801
00:50:27,821 --> 00:50:30,658
She killed herself
three months later.

802
00:50:30,725 --> 00:50:33,660
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

803
00:50:33,728 --> 00:50:35,663
Very compassionate.

804
00:50:35,729 --> 00:50:38,800
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

805
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,236
and used the profits
from the sale ofher home...

806
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:46,140
to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

807
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:47,874
Heavens.

808
00:50:47,974 --> 00:50:50,711
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

809
00:50:50,812 --> 00:50:54,448
to have sex
with an eleven-year-old boy.

810
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:57,584
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

811
00:50:57,684 --> 00:51:00,421
from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

812
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:02,923
because it was-- survey says--

813
00:51:04,392 --> 00:51:06,260
less costly.

814
00:51:06,326 --> 00:51:09,295
You, on the other hand...

815
00:51:09,396 --> 00:51:11,632
are an innocent.

816
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:13,600
You lead a good life.

817
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:14,734
Good for you.

818
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:18,706
But you, Mr. Whitland...

819
00:51:18,806 --> 00:51:20,774
you have more skeletons
in your closet...

820
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:22,775
than this assembled party.

821
00:51:22,843 --> 00:51:25,512
I cannot even mention them aloud.

822
00:51:29,382 --> 00:51:32,986
You're his father,
you sick fuck!

823
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,657
- Good.
- Not bad, man.

824
00:51:37,757 --> 00:51:39,693
That's great work.
Very good.

825
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,529
Well...

826
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,865
alone at last.

827
00:51:45,966 --> 00:51:48,468
With the exception of Miss Pryce here...

828
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:52,372
there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

829
00:51:52,438 --> 00:51:54,175
Not one.

830
00:51:54,274 --> 00:51:57,845
do you know what makes
a human being decent?

831
00:51:57,944 --> 00:51:59,178
Fear.

832
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:01,348
And therein lies the problem.

833
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:04,384
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

834
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:07,887
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

835
00:52:07,987 --> 00:52:11,190
hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

836
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:14,527
ives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

837
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:18,231
But not from God.

838
00:52:23,236 --> 00:52:25,304
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

839
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,044
Man, it really looks
just likeyou, doesn't it?

840
00:52:31,144 --> 00:52:34,880
Look, if i believed enough in this...

841
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,548
I wonder--

842
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:56,068
Come on.
I don't believe in voodoo.

843
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:02,375
Voodoo.

844
00:53:09,782 --> 00:53:12,350
But I do believe in this.

845
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:14,853
Don't run! Don't run!

846
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,690
Fakes! Fakes!
All of you, fakes!

847
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:22,427
" But I do believe in this."

848
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:23,963
What does that mean?

849
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:25,497
And one to grow on.

850
00:53:31,571 --> 00:53:32,638
Gum?

851
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:36,575
Go on. It's okay.

852
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:38,711
You've done nothing wrong.

853
00:53:38,811 --> 00:53:41,880
These guys were fakes.

854
00:53:41,981 --> 00:53:44,316
You're a pure soul.

855
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,486
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

856
00:53:49,588 --> 00:53:51,022
Loki!

857
00:53:53,091 --> 00:53:54,526
You're getting off light.

858
00:53:54,592 --> 00:53:56,595
- Loki!
- I know. I'm comin´.

859
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:02,067
You're so lucky.

860
00:54:06,437 --> 00:54:09,307
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

861
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:10,809
Three years this August.

862
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:14,512
Let me guess-- the 14th Apostle, left
out of the Bible because she's a woman?

863
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:15,814
This girl's no woman.

864
00:54:15,914 --> 00:54:18,917
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

865
00:54:19,017 --> 00:54:20,718
What, these?

866
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:24,989
You should know better than anyone here
that tits don't make a woman.

867
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,492
Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

868
00:54:27,558 --> 00:54:31,062
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things--

869
00:54:31,162 --> 00:54:32,831
her legs.

870
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:35,366
But as you can see...

871
00:54:35,432 --> 00:54:37,168
I lack definition.

872
00:54:37,268 --> 00:54:40,972
Hey, they're gettin´ a free show!
Let me see that shit!

873
00:54:41,072 --> 00:54:44,075
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

874
00:54:44,175 --> 00:54:46,811
How do you--
How does she know Metatron?

875
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:48,879
This is the last scion.

876
00:54:49,814 --> 00:54:52,550
You're kidding.

877
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,285
Wow.

878
00:54:54,386 --> 00:54:55,386
I'm confused.

879
00:54:55,486 --> 00:54:59,556
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

880
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:03,327
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

881
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:07,164
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

882
00:55:07,264 --> 00:55:08,800
I'm a muse, stupid.

883
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,470
I can't take much more of this.

884
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,238
So you, what, inspire people?

885
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:17,041
Whatjust went down
with your friends over there--

886
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:20,044
It doesn't really take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

887
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:22,079
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

888
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:27,651
For example, I'm responsible for 1 9 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

889
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:30,321
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

890
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:33,356
The one about the kid
by himselfin his house...

891
00:55:33,424 --> 00:55:36,425
burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off--

892
00:55:36,526 --> 00:55:38,762
I had nothing to do
with that one.

893
00:55:38,862 --> 00:55:43,200
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.

894
00:56:01,518 --> 00:56:03,920
What are you doing stripping?

895
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:05,421
Remember why I left?

896
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:08,924
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

897
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:12,128
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

898
00:56:12,228 --> 00:56:16,131
I gave my two weeks notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

899
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:19,235
and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

900
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:20,871
So what happened?

901
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:23,706
Writer's block.

902
00:56:23,806 --> 00:56:26,676
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

903
00:56:26,742 --> 00:56:30,746
I can inspire anyone I meet and give out
a zillion and nine ideas a second...

904
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,782
but I can't keep any for myself.

905
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:36,787
Her quirky sense ofhumor.

906
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:39,089
- Whose?
- God's.

907
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:42,124
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there ever a doubt in your mind?

908
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:43,960
He's always referred to as " Him."

909
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,861
That's not how I wrote it.

910
00:56:45,962 --> 00:56:47,897
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

911
00:56:47,963 --> 00:56:50,666
is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

912
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:53,803
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

913
00:56:53,903 --> 00:56:56,405
and all the penholders were men.

914
00:56:56,505 --> 00:57:00,443
So She became a He.
Doesn't stop with God either.

915
00:57:00,509 --> 00:57:02,545
The whole book's gender-biased.

916
00:57:02,645 --> 00:57:04,847
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

917
00:57:04,947 --> 00:57:07,116
A woman cuts Samson coif of power.

918
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:10,619
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

919
00:57:10,685 --> 00:57:12,154
Read that book again.

920
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:15,325
Women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the Egyptians and Romans combined.

921
00:57:15,425 --> 00:57:16,658
It stinks.

922
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,799
Why is the last scion here?

923
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,869
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

924
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:31,106
- Not the plenary indulgence loop hole.
- You know about that?

925
00:57:31,206 --> 00:57:34,142
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

926
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,144
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

927
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:38,713
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

928
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:42,351
I have issues with anyone who treats God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

929
00:57:42,451 --> 00:57:43,819
like some Catholics.

930
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:46,855
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

931
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:51,126
-lf we're wrong, what religion is right?
-It's not about who's right orwrong.

932
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:53,161
No denomination's nailed it yet...

933
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:55,831
because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

934
00:57:55,931 --> 00:58:00,868
that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in,just that you have faith.

935
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:05,373
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

936
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,311
They made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

937
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:18,185
Who fuckin´ farted?

938
00:58:19,687 --> 00:58:22,890
Not born.
Shit into existence.

939
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,197
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

940
00:58:29,264 --> 00:58:31,733
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

941
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:34,069
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

942
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:35,570
A shit demon!

943
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:39,274
No man of woman born!

944
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:43,211
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

945
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:44,912
It came for Bethany!

946
00:58:45,012 --> 00:58:47,948
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thang!

947
00:58:48,015 --> 00:58:50,485
I knew I's gonna
whack somebody today!

948
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:52,487
Get your fuckin´ hand back.

949
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:53,755
Represent!

950
00:58:55,155 --> 00:58:57,592
Go! Go! Go!

951
00:59:18,913 --> 00:59:21,348
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

952
00:59:22,716 --> 00:59:24,217
Over the bar!

953
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:37,164
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

954
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:39,233
The hill where Christ
was crucified.

955
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:42,068
It wasn'tjust Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

956
00:59:42,168 --> 00:59:45,672
Christ excluded, theywere criminals--
killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

957
00:59:45,772 --> 00:59:48,876
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

958
00:59:48,976 --> 00:59:51,478
spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

959
00:59:51,578 --> 00:59:54,448
the result of which
is that walking pile of crap--

960
00:59:54,515 --> 00:59:57,585
the Golgothan shit demon,
Hell's chief assassin.

961
00:59:57,685 --> 00:59:59,452
It's here for you, girlie.

962
01:00:04,057 --> 01:00:06,260
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

963
01:00:39,158 --> 01:00:41,395
- Hey, man.
- How?

964
01:00:43,529 --> 01:00:45,165
" Knocks strong odors out."

965
01:00:45,264 --> 01:00:48,201
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

966
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,971
What?

967
01:00:52,071 --> 01:00:54,007
Whoever sent this might send more.

968
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:58,010
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

969
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:00,646
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

970
01:01:00,746 --> 01:01:03,483
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

971
01:01:04,817 --> 01:01:07,086
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

972
01:01:07,186 --> 01:01:08,854
Jersey's sold out, sir.

973
01:01:08,954 --> 01:01:11,523
- What?
- There's one at the same time tomorrow.

974
01:01:11,624 --> 01:01:15,561
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State.

975
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:17,963
Show up two hours in advance.

976
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:21,667
Nice.

977
01:01:21,734 --> 01:01:24,671
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

978
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:28,841
what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

979
01:01:28,941 --> 01:01:30,575
Bus, schmuss.

980
01:01:30,676 --> 01:01:35,247
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

981
01:01:35,348 --> 01:01:37,783
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

982
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:39,418
Fuck, let's use 'em!

983
01:01:39,518 --> 01:01:41,954
I wouldn't suggest that.

984
01:01:43,355 --> 01:01:45,157
You see, kids...

985
01:01:45,257 --> 01:01:48,694
you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

986
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,401
How'd you get out of Hell?

987
01:01:56,501 --> 01:01:58,737
I told them I was coming up
on a routine possession.

988
01:01:58,837 --> 01:02:02,040
I don't have much time. If they figure
out my ruse, they'll come after me.

989
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:05,844
-What's with bringing us in here?
-You two are inches from getting caught.

990
01:02:05,944 --> 01:02:09,414
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

991
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:11,450
Don't you know what's going on?

992
01:02:11,517 --> 01:02:13,451
Well, we're going home.

993
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:17,956
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into Heaven?

994
01:02:18,056 --> 01:02:20,592
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

995
01:02:20,692 --> 01:02:23,628
Both sides.
Above and below.

996
01:02:23,695 --> 01:02:25,965
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

997
01:02:26,065 --> 01:02:27,465
- Really?
- Why?

998
01:02:27,532 --> 01:02:29,668
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

999
01:02:31,036 --> 01:02:33,671
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1000
01:02:33,772 --> 01:02:37,009
and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you assholes might make him look bad...

1001
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:39,043
by succeeding
where he's failed so many times.

1002
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:42,180
- So they'rejust gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1003
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,217
That's why you have to travel
incognito.

1004
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:48,319
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1005
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,355
Quit killing people.
That's high profile.

1006
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:53,325
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1007
01:02:53,391 --> 01:02:55,326
Oh, believe it, boys.

1008
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,797
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1009
01:02:58,896 --> 01:03:00,631
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1010
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:03,701
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1011
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:05,737
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1012
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:09,040
In the meantime, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1013
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:11,175
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1014
01:03:11,276 --> 01:03:14,445
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1015
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:17,482
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1016
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:21,185
And remember, incognito.

1017
01:03:25,622 --> 01:03:28,226
How you coping, kid?

1018
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:29,993
It's weird.

1019
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:32,663
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1020
01:03:32,763 --> 01:03:36,000
something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1021
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,636
Sometimes I wish
i'd just stayed home.

1022
01:03:38,736 --> 01:03:41,372
You sound like the Man.

1023
01:03:41,472 --> 01:03:42,874
What's he like?

1024
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,476
He likes to listen to people talk.

1025
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:49,013
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1026
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,448
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1027
01:03:51,514 --> 01:03:53,684
he always had a smile
on his face.

1028
01:03:53,784 --> 01:03:55,820
His only real beefwith mankind...

1029
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,156
is the shit that gets carried out
in His name.

1030
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:02,659
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1031
01:04:02,726 --> 01:04:06,363
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1032
01:04:06,463 --> 01:04:08,398
He said mankind
got it all wrong...

1033
01:04:08,465 --> 01:04:11,936
by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1034
01:04:12,035 --> 01:04:14,671
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1035
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:16,840
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1036
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,044
You can change an idea.
Changing a beliefis trickier.

1037
01:04:20,143 --> 01:04:22,612
People die for it.
People kill for it.

1038
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:25,149
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1039
01:04:25,216 --> 01:04:30,353
because of the Catholic belief structure
regarding this plenary indulgence shit.

1040
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,690
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1041
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:34,723
are exploiting that belief...

1042
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:36,260
and if they're successful...

1043
01:04:36,326 --> 01:04:40,497
you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1044
01:04:40,597 --> 01:04:42,565
All over a belief.

1045
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:48,772
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1046
01:04:48,872 --> 01:04:51,941
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1047
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:55,378
and he went flying through the air,
fuckin´ crashed through the wall.

1048
01:04:55,444 --> 01:04:56,880
It was fucked up.

1049
01:04:56,946 --> 01:04:59,882
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1050
01:04:59,949 --> 01:05:03,186
We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1051
01:05:03,286 --> 01:05:06,489
who just got on at the last stop--
Larry and Barry.

1052
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:10,659
So,Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1053
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:17,834
Hit this shit, man.
It's good stuff.

1054
01:05:19,202 --> 01:05:20,636
Oh, fuck.

1055
01:05:24,206 --> 01:05:26,643
That's some bad shit, dude.

1056
01:05:26,709 --> 01:05:28,644
You hit that?

1057
01:05:31,047 --> 01:05:32,981
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1058
01:05:36,184 --> 01:05:37,653
Bad shit.

1059
01:05:38,654 --> 01:05:41,124
Why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1060
01:05:41,224 --> 01:05:44,660
It's just this thing I have to do.

1061
01:05:44,728 --> 01:05:46,195
We're going home.

1062
01:05:46,295 --> 01:05:49,031
Oh.
do you two live together?

1063
01:05:49,131 --> 01:05:50,966
Unfortunately, yes.

1064
01:05:53,636 --> 01:05:56,372
So, how long haveyou two
been together?

1065
01:05:57,672 --> 01:05:59,475
A while.

1066
01:05:59,575 --> 01:06:03,278
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1067
01:06:03,379 --> 01:06:04,946
How'd you meet?

1068
01:06:05,046 --> 01:06:06,616
We were stationed together.

1069
01:06:06,715 --> 01:06:09,084
See, that's beautiful.

1070
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:13,021
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1071
01:06:14,123 --> 01:06:15,190
Pardon?

1072
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:19,561
You know, there's all the macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1073
01:06:19,661 --> 01:06:21,897
You two meet there, hook up--

1074
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:26,034
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1075
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:28,570
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:06:28,637 --> 01:06:31,741
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1077
01:06:34,576 --> 01:06:37,745
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1078
01:06:37,845 --> 01:06:40,381
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1079
01:06:40,481 --> 01:06:42,050
I call it being dumped.

1080
01:06:42,151 --> 01:06:44,119
I was...

1081
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:45,854
dumped once.

1082
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:48,890
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1083
01:06:48,957 --> 01:06:51,560
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1084
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:55,229
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1085
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:56,765
and call you back.

1086
01:06:56,831 --> 01:07:00,268
They always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1087
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:02,437
When actually...

1088
01:07:02,537 --> 01:07:04,206
it hurts more.

1089
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:09,844
You know what we need?

1090
01:07:09,944 --> 01:07:11,746
What do we need?

1091
01:07:11,846 --> 01:07:13,348
We need drinks.

1092
01:07:15,017 --> 01:07:16,918
We need a lot ofdrinks.

1093
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,455
Garcon.

1094
01:07:26,861 --> 01:07:28,863
You still go to church?

1095
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:31,098
Every Sunday.

1096
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:33,601
Does it do anything for you?

1097
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:36,805
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook everyweek.

1098
01:07:36,905 --> 01:07:40,942
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1099
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:43,277
They go to church and feel bored...

1100
01:07:43,378 --> 01:07:46,781
but they keep going everyweek
just out of habit.

1101
01:07:46,847 --> 01:07:49,116
I am so buzzed.

1102
01:07:50,751 --> 01:07:53,687
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1103
01:07:53,754 --> 01:07:55,956
I remember the exact moment.

1104
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:02,329
I was on the phone with my mother...

1105
01:08:02,429 --> 01:08:06,367
and she was trying to counsel me
through this--

1106
01:08:07,534 --> 01:08:08,970
this thing.

1107
01:08:11,072 --> 01:08:15,509
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1108
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:17,511
she said...

1109
01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:19,480
" Bethany...

1110
01:08:19,546 --> 01:08:21,482
God has a plan."

1111
01:08:24,885 --> 01:08:28,555
I was-- I was so angry with her.

1112
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:32,258
I was like...

1113
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,295
"What about my plans?"

1114
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:36,196
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

1115
01:08:36,296 --> 01:08:39,299
I had planned
to have a family...

1116
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,034
with my husband.

1117
01:08:41,134 --> 01:08:44,070
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1118
01:08:47,974 --> 01:08:49,910
Apparently not.

1119
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:57,184
How about you?
How'd you lose your faith?

1120
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,587
A long time ago.

1121
01:09:00,687 --> 01:09:04,157
One day Godjust stopped listening.

1122
01:09:04,258 --> 01:09:08,795
I kept talking, but I got the distinct
impression He wasn't listening anymore.

1123
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:12,365
How did you know She was listening
in the first place?

1124
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,170
Well, I guess I don't.

1125
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,439
I hate thoughts like that.

1126
01:09:20,607 --> 01:09:23,642
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1127
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:28,114
'cause when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1128
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:32,386
God's in Heaven, and He's--

1129
01:09:32,486 --> 01:09:35,922
She's always got her eye on you.

1130
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:43,362
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1131
01:09:48,467 --> 01:09:51,670
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1132
01:09:59,878 --> 01:10:02,081
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1133
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:05,351
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1134
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,753
All right, but I warned you.

1135
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:09,521
Okay.

1136
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:13,191
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1137
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:15,060
Really.

1138
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:19,598
Kerwood Mandel to carthree.
Kerwood Mandel to carthree.

1139
01:10:19,665 --> 01:10:23,102
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1140
01:10:23,202 --> 01:10:25,136
from going into the church.

1141
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:28,873
They're trying--

1142
01:10:28,973 --> 01:10:30,409
Shit.

1143
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:34,647
They're trying
to get back into Heaven.

1144
01:10:38,016 --> 01:10:40,586
See, they got tossed
out of Heaven...

1145
01:10:40,686 --> 01:10:42,153
years ago, right?

1146
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:45,391
And if they get back in...

1147
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,325
it proves God wrong...

1148
01:10:47,426 --> 01:10:50,562
and since God is infallible...

1149
01:10:50,662 --> 01:10:52,398
to prove Herwrong...

1150
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,733
would, you know, unmake existence.

1151
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,638
May i have your attention, please.

1152
01:10:59,738 --> 01:11:03,975
The diningc ar will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

1153
01:11:04,075 --> 01:11:06,678
I feel so stupid...

1154
01:11:06,778 --> 01:11:08,713
just saying it.

1155
01:11:10,181 --> 01:11:12,483
The thing I don't get is...

1156
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:15,253
how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1157
01:11:15,353 --> 01:11:16,788
Two, even!

1158
01:11:21,926 --> 01:11:25,263
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1159
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:27,465
Maybe you're supposed to kill them.

1160
01:11:27,565 --> 01:11:30,735
Oh, yeah, right.
Kill them.

1161
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:36,574
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1162
01:11:37,842 --> 01:11:40,844
how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1163
01:11:41,646 --> 01:11:43,648
Oh...

1164
01:11:43,748 --> 01:11:45,650
I don't suppose
it's much different from...

1165
01:11:46,718 --> 01:11:48,151
killing a human.

1166
01:11:49,588 --> 01:11:52,156
Where is everybody?
I wake up and--

1167
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:56,060
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1168
01:11:56,127 --> 01:11:59,129
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1169
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:04,469
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1170
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:07,305
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1171
01:12:07,405 --> 01:12:09,639
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1172
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:13,309
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1173
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:16,313
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1174
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:19,283
Save it. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1175
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,284
Loki!

1176
01:12:21,352 --> 01:12:22,586
Holy shit. The apostle.

1177
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:24,754
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1178
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:26,823
What are you doing here?

1179
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:28,859
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1180
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:30,861
- Us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1181
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:34,565
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1182
01:12:34,665 --> 01:12:37,435
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1183
01:12:37,535 --> 01:12:39,202
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1184
01:12:39,302 --> 01:12:42,239
We're going home,
no matter whose pride it may hurt.

1185
01:12:42,305 --> 01:12:44,775
- It's not a matter ofpride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1186
01:12:44,874 --> 01:12:47,544
What are you, high? I can't kill her
ifshe hasn't done anything.

1187
01:12:47,644 --> 01:12:49,079
Fine.
I'll kill her myself.

1188
01:12:49,146 --> 01:12:51,448
I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1189
01:12:51,548 --> 01:12:54,084
- These guys are fuckin´ flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1190
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,728
Oh, shit!

1191
01:13:07,197 --> 01:13:08,666
Jay!

1192
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,033
Biggie!

1193
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:13,603
The door! The door!

1194
01:13:17,406 --> 01:13:19,643
Can't we talk about this?

1195
01:13:25,148 --> 01:13:28,118
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1196
01:14:08,123 --> 01:14:09,558
No ticket.

1197
01:14:12,861 --> 01:14:15,531
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1198
01:14:15,631 --> 01:14:19,101
- Then you know who she was, don't you?
- The scion, I imagine!

1199
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:22,005
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1200
01:14:22,105 --> 01:14:25,274
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1201
01:14:25,374 --> 01:14:29,312
And Azrael tells us we're marked?
There's more to this than we thought of.

1202
01:14:29,412 --> 01:14:31,413
I was close.

1203
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:34,649
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1204
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:35,818
Whoa.

1205
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:39,155
You know how I felt?
Righteous.

1206
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:40,822
Justified.
Eager, even.

1207
01:14:40,922 --> 01:14:42,958
You all right?
Your eyes are kinda--

1208
01:14:43,059 --> 01:14:45,159
My eyes are open.

1209
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:47,195
For the first time I get it.

1210
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:51,033
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1211
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:54,869
See, in the beginning it was
just us and Him-- angels and God.

1212
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:56,705
Then He created humans.

1213
01:14:56,805 --> 01:14:59,807
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1214
01:14:59,908 --> 01:15:03,144
and bowing and scraping and adoration.

1215
01:15:03,244 --> 01:15:07,682
He gave them more than He ever gave us.
He gave them a choice.

1216
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:11,019
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore Him.

1217
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:13,054
All this time
we've been down here...

1218
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:15,690
I've felt the absence
of the Divine Presence...

1219
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:19,061
and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1220
01:15:19,161 --> 01:15:23,098
And why?
Because of the way He made us.

1221
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:26,501
Had we been given free will we could
choose to ignore the pain, like they do.

1222
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:28,369
But no, we're servants.

1223
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:30,472
Okay.

1224
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:34,075
All I'm saying here is that
one ofus might need a little nap.

1225
01:15:34,176 --> 01:15:38,080
Wake up! These humans have besmirched
everything He's bestowed upon them.

1226
01:15:38,146 --> 01:15:40,081
Theywere given paradise;
they threw it away.

1227
01:15:40,148 --> 01:15:42,583
Theywere given this planet;
they destroyed it.

1228
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:45,187
Theywere favored best
among all His endeavors...

1229
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:48,590
and some of them
don't even believe He exists!

1230
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,758
And in spite ofit all...

1231
01:15:50,858 --> 01:15:54,562
He has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1232
01:15:54,663 --> 01:15:56,430
at every turn.

1233
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,032
What about us?

1234
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:02,170
I asked you once...

1235
01:16:02,237 --> 01:16:05,173
to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1236
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:07,042
What was the result?

1237
01:16:07,141 --> 01:16:09,377
Our expulsion from paradise.

1238
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:12,046
Where was His
infinite fucking patience then?

1239
01:16:12,146 --> 01:16:14,982
It's not right!
It's not fair!

1240
01:16:15,049 --> 01:16:16,985
We've paid our debt!

1241
01:16:18,452 --> 01:16:21,189
Don't you think it's time?

1242
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:24,159
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1243
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:30,798
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1244
01:16:30,898 --> 01:16:33,567
Wait. Wait, wait.
Kill them?

1245
01:16:34,702 --> 01:16:37,404
You're talking about the last scion,
for Christ's sake.

1246
01:16:37,504 --> 01:16:40,441
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1247
01:16:40,507 --> 01:16:42,043
Don't.
Don't, my friend.

1248
01:16:42,143 --> 01:16:45,746
Don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1249
01:16:45,846 --> 01:16:47,314
They did me once.

1250
01:16:47,414 --> 01:16:49,317
Scion or not...

1251
01:16:49,383 --> 01:16:50,817
she's just a human...

1252
01:16:50,884 --> 01:16:54,021
and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1253
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,090
No harm, no foul.

1254
01:16:57,291 --> 01:17:00,228
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1255
01:17:01,761 --> 01:17:03,129
What did you say?

1256
01:17:03,197 --> 01:17:06,266
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1257
01:17:06,366 --> 01:17:09,370
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking face!

1258
01:17:09,469 --> 01:17:12,539
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1259
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:15,209
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1260
01:17:15,309 --> 01:17:17,845
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1261
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:20,847
Well, fuck that.

1262
01:17:20,947 --> 01:17:25,318
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the Throne.

1263
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,388
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1264
01:17:29,455 --> 01:17:31,658
We're going home, Loki...

1265
01:17:31,758 --> 01:17:35,796
and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty Himself...

1266
01:17:35,896 --> 01:17:37,830
is gonna make that otherwise.

1267
01:17:44,337 --> 01:17:45,772
Shit.

1268
01:17:46,973 --> 01:17:50,577
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1269
01:17:50,677 --> 01:17:52,378
Very basic strategy.

1270
01:17:52,478 --> 01:17:55,915
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1271
01:17:55,982 --> 01:17:57,083
Why are we enemies?

1272
01:17:57,183 --> 01:18:00,520
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1273
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:04,023
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1274
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:07,727
I'm tired
of all this cryptic bullshit.

1275
01:18:07,827 --> 01:18:10,363
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1276
01:18:10,463 --> 01:18:13,699
and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1277
01:18:13,799 --> 01:18:16,169
unless you come clean right now.

1278
01:18:16,268 --> 01:18:18,337
Why me?

1279
01:18:18,437 --> 01:18:21,907
Out of all the people
on the goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1280
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:24,944
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1281
01:18:26,178 --> 01:18:30,182
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1282
01:18:30,283 --> 01:18:33,853
How long do you think it would take to
come to grips with something that huge?

1283
01:18:33,954 --> 01:18:36,588
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1284
01:18:36,689 --> 01:18:41,760
In the Bible,Jesus suddenly
goes from age 12 to 30. 12 to 30.

1285
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:44,062
Now, that's some pretty bad
story telling.

1286
01:18:44,163 --> 01:18:47,099
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1287
01:18:47,165 --> 01:18:48,468
I'll tell you where.

1288
01:18:48,568 --> 01:18:53,272
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1289
01:18:53,372 --> 01:18:56,375
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1290
01:18:56,475 --> 01:18:59,212
to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1291
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:03,016
Oh, bullshit.

1292
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:05,050
Any important material
about Christ...

1293
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:07,719
would give people a better understanding
of the nature ofGod.

1294
01:19:07,819 --> 01:19:11,824
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with His family.

1295
01:19:11,924 --> 01:19:14,926
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1296
01:19:15,027 --> 01:19:19,264
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1297
01:19:19,365 --> 01:19:23,735
Mary gave birth to Christ without having
known a man's touch. This is true.

1298
01:19:23,802 --> 01:19:25,737
But she did have a husband.

1299
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:29,474
do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1300
01:19:29,574 --> 01:19:31,143
ifhe wasn't gettin´ laid?

1301
01:19:31,243 --> 01:19:34,679
The nature of God and the Virgin Birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1302
01:19:34,746 --> 01:19:38,984
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1303
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:40,185
Meaning?

1304
01:19:40,285 --> 01:19:42,220
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1305
01:19:42,287 --> 01:19:44,956
shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1306
01:19:45,056 --> 01:19:46,791
with the one you call Jesus.

1307
01:19:47,892 --> 01:19:49,795
Bethany, you are...

1308
01:19:49,861 --> 01:19:54,865
the great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandniece...

1309
01:19:54,965 --> 01:19:56,902
of Jesus Christ.

1310
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:04,776
So, that would make Bethany
part black?

1311
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,449
I can't do this anymore.

1312
01:20:16,587 --> 01:20:19,858
Whereyou gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1313
01:20:19,957 --> 01:20:21,726
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1314
01:20:21,826 --> 01:20:23,394
It's bullshit!

1315
01:20:27,098 --> 01:20:29,434
Let her go, man.

1316
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:31,001
Give her time.

1317
01:20:38,342 --> 01:20:40,345
Why?

1318
01:20:40,445 --> 01:20:43,380
What the fuck do You want from me?

1319
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:45,850
I fucking hate You!

1320
01:20:46,784 --> 01:20:48,419
I hate You.

1321
01:20:48,519 --> 01:20:50,755
He can't hear you, you know.

1322
01:20:56,526 --> 01:20:58,563
That's why we needed you.

1323
01:20:58,663 --> 01:21:00,931
Why didn't you tell me?

1324
01:21:01,031 --> 01:21:02,166
Would you--

1325
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:05,536
Could you have believed me?

1326
00:00:00,000 --> 01:21:08,839
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1327
01:21:09,773 --> 01:21:12,042
Only after everything you've seen...

1328
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,277
everything you've heard...

1329
01:21:16,313 --> 01:21:19,383
could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1330
01:21:19,483 --> 01:21:21,451
I don't want this.

1331
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:26,756
It's too big.

1332
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:28,525
That's what Jesus said.

1333
01:21:30,727 --> 01:21:32,663
I had to tell Him.

1334
01:21:35,865 --> 01:21:38,868
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1335
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:42,272
not to be able
to tell the Son Himself...

1336
01:21:42,372 --> 01:21:45,342
because one word from His lips would
destroy the boy's frail human form.

1337
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:48,779
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1338
01:21:48,879 --> 01:21:51,081
who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1339
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:55,285
I had to tell this little boy
that He was God's only son...

1340
01:21:55,385 --> 01:21:58,321
and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1341
01:21:58,387 --> 01:22:01,591
at the hands of the very people
He'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1342
01:22:03,826 --> 01:22:05,962
He begged me to take it all back.

1343
01:22:07,396 --> 01:22:08,965
As if i could.

1344
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:13,469
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1345
01:22:13,569 --> 01:22:17,975
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
something I've never told anyone before.

1346
01:22:19,442 --> 01:22:21,378
If I had the power...

1347
01:22:22,845 --> 01:22:24,279
I would have.

1348
01:22:25,014 --> 01:22:26,182
It's unfair.

1349
01:22:26,283 --> 01:22:29,919
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1350
01:22:30,018 --> 01:22:32,288
and to ask you to do the same now.

1351
01:22:32,389 --> 01:22:34,090
I sympathize. I do.

1352
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,626
I wish I could take it all back.

1353
01:22:39,095 --> 01:22:40,663
But I can't.

1354
01:22:43,566 --> 01:22:45,000
This...

1355
01:22:46,235 --> 01:22:48,303
is who you are.

1356
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,808
Everything I am has been a lie?

1357
01:22:56,879 --> 01:23:01,451
Knowing what you now know
doesn't mean you're not who you were.

1358
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:02,651
You are...

1359
01:23:02,751 --> 01:23:04,319
Bethany Sloane.

1360
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:07,355
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1361
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:13,929
All this means is
a redefinition ofthat identity.

1362
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:17,633 
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1363
01:23:17,733 --> 01:23:19,901
Be who you've always been.

1364
01:23:21,003 --> 01:23:22,137
Just...

1365
01:23:23,105 --> 01:23:24,706
be this as well...

1366
01:23:26,475 --> 01:23:28,977
from time to time.

1367
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:35,517
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1368
01:23:35,584 --> 01:23:37,819
To say the least.

1369
01:23:45,993 --> 01:23:48,530
Do you mind if we ad journ
to somewhere...

1370
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:51,232
a tad more habitable...

1371
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:52,901
and a bit warmer?

1372
01:24:07,782 --> 01:24:10,451
Fuck, I think this shit
just kicked in.

1373
01:24:10,552 --> 01:24:13,422
Weren't wejust in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1374
01:24:13,488 --> 01:24:15,457
Going out in style.

1375
01:24:15,557 --> 01:24:18,126
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1376
01:24:18,227 --> 01:24:20,028
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1377
01:24:20,128 --> 01:24:22,296
The voice of God.
Show some respect.

1378
01:24:22,396 --> 01:24:24,832
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of Him?

1379
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:27,135
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1380
01:24:27,235 --> 01:24:29,971
- What?
- Didn't it ever occur to you...

1381
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:34,074
that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of His control?

1382
01:24:34,174 --> 01:24:35,910
Yes, but then whywas she tapped?

1383
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:39,980
You know those constitutionals
that He likes to take?

1384
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:41,315
"Constitutionals"?

1385
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:43,884
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1386
01:24:43,984 --> 01:24:45,920
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1387
01:24:47,187 --> 01:24:50,224
The Lord has quite a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it foryears.

1388
01:24:50,324 --> 01:24:52,326
He assumes a human form once a month
and indulges.

1389
01:24:52,426 --> 01:24:55,929
Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing.
Hejust goes away for a couple of hours.

1390
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:59,633
And He always gives His free points away
to neighbor hood children.

1391
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:01,168
Isn't that sweet?

1392
01:25:01,235 --> 01:25:04,805
But She hasn't come back
from one of these day trips?

1393
01:25:04,906 --> 01:25:07,275
No, "She" hasn't...

1394
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:10,176
and we've been unable to locate " Her."

1395
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:13,580
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1396
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:17,551
No, there's a different sort
of foul play a foot, children.

1397
01:25:18,686 --> 01:25:22,156
Whomever has set the renegade angels
on their path...

1398
01:25:22,256 --> 01:25:24,691
and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1399
01:25:24,758 --> 01:25:27,728
is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1400
01:25:27,827 --> 01:25:30,064
Were He to be killed in human form...

1401
01:25:30,164 --> 01:25:32,800
He'd have returned
immediately to Heaven.

1402
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,868
Someone knew enough...

1403
01:25:34,969 --> 01:25:37,070
to keep Him biologically alive...

1404
01:25:37,171 --> 01:25:40,141
but incapacitate Him
in another fashion.

1405
01:25:40,207 --> 01:25:42,942
And as omnipotent as we are above...

1406
01:25:43,043 --> 01:25:46,479
I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without His presence.

1407
01:25:46,579 --> 01:25:48,515
We've looked everywhere for Him.

1408
01:25:48,581 --> 01:25:53,420
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind this.

1409
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,789
But whoever he is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys afteryou...

1410
01:25:56,889 --> 01:25:58,959
as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1411
01:25:59,059 --> 01:26:00,793
Could it be Lucifer?

1412
01:26:00,893 --> 01:26:02,261
Not Lucifer.

1413
01:26:02,362 --> 01:26:05,865
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1414
01:26:05,966 --> 01:26:08,902
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1415
01:26:08,969 --> 01:26:12,172
because he's hadjust as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1416
01:26:12,272 --> 01:26:13,740
What do we do now?

1417
01:26:13,807 --> 01:26:16,643
I say we get drunk,
'cause I'm all out of ideas.

1418
01:26:16,743 --> 01:26:19,713
Why don't wejust ask this guy
to close the church?

1419
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:21,580
I beg your pardon?

1420
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:23,617
The guy in charge
of the church thing.

1421
01:26:26,452 --> 01:26:28,354
Cardinal Glick?

1422
01:26:28,421 --> 01:26:30,557
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1423
01:26:30,657 --> 01:26:33,993
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1424
01:26:34,094 --> 01:26:35,362
Good Lord.

1425
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:37,497
The little stoner's got a point.

1426
01:26:37,597 --> 01:26:42,168
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
cancelling the rededication ceremony.

1427
01:26:42,268 --> 01:26:44,270
"We"?

1428
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:47,439
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. l-Don't-Think-l-Can-Do-This-Anymore?

1429
01:26:51,777 --> 01:26:55,081
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now would I?

1430
01:26:57,983 --> 01:26:58,918
Well...

1431
01:27:00,152 --> 01:27:03,956
the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1432
01:27:04,056 --> 01:27:07,193
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1433
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:11,764
but if we can let 'em know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1434
01:27:11,864 --> 01:27:14,900
we can win 'em back,
even get some new ones.

1435
01:27:15,001 --> 01:27:16,568
Excuse me.

1436
01:27:18,638 --> 01:27:20,239
Fill them pews, people.

1437
01:27:20,339 --> 01:27:23,275
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1438
01:27:23,342 --> 01:27:25,811
Hook 'em while they're young.

1439
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:30,048
- Kinda like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1440
01:27:30,148 --> 01:27:33,252
We really appreciate you seeing us
this late in the day, Your Eminence.

1441
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:36,922
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1442
01:27:37,022 --> 01:27:39,491
about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1443
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:42,060
You looking to help out in some way?

1444
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,930
We'd likeyou to cancel the ceremony.

1445
01:27:46,031 --> 01:27:47,633
I beg your pardon.

1446
01:27:47,733 --> 01:27:51,736
There's gonna be a world of trouble if
tomorrow's ceremony goes on as planned.

1447
01:27:52,838 --> 01:27:55,640
are you pro-choice?

1448
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:57,309
The trouble's not from us.

1449
01:27:57,409 --> 01:28:00,746
It's from these renegade angels that've
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1450
01:28:03,514 --> 01:28:06,017
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1451
01:28:06,117 --> 01:28:08,287
See, Padre, it goes down like this.

1452
01:28:08,387 --> 01:28:13,091
These guys think that by passing through
that archway, they can go to Heaven.

1453
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:16,794
You want me to call offthe ceremony
for that.

1454
01:28:17,895 --> 01:28:18,997
Who sent you?

1455
01:28:21,099 --> 01:28:24,135
We were sent
by Him who is called I Am!

1456
01:28:24,235 --> 01:28:26,804
Cute. Really cute.

1457
01:28:26,905 --> 01:28:29,273
Playtime with the cardinal is over.

1458
01:28:29,373 --> 01:28:31,977
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1459
01:28:32,076 --> 01:28:33,679
It's not a joke.

1460
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:36,848
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1461
01:28:36,948 --> 01:28:39,917
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1462
01:28:39,984 --> 01:28:42,920
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1463
01:28:42,986 --> 01:28:45,523
And its platform of non involvement
during the Holocaust?

1464
01:28:45,622 --> 01:28:48,059
All right, mistakes were made.

1465
01:28:48,127 --> 01:28:51,196
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1466
01:28:51,296 --> 01:28:53,297
responsible for the oversights of old.

1467
01:28:53,398 --> 01:28:57,135
I'm a very important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1468
01:28:57,235 --> 01:28:58,703
so if you please--

1469
01:28:58,803 --> 01:29:01,538
- But tomorrow--
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1470
01:29:01,638 --> 01:29:02,974
Do I make myself clear?

1471
01:29:03,074 --> 01:29:07,711
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God Himself...

1472
01:29:07,812 --> 01:29:10,748
is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1473
01:29:31,735 --> 01:29:33,737
I can see the headlines now...

1474
01:29:33,837 --> 01:29:35,773
if there were gonna be any.

1475
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,441
" Existence Erased."

1476
01:29:37,541 --> 01:29:39,742
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1477
01:29:39,843 --> 01:29:42,179
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1478
01:29:44,714 --> 01:29:45,850
What up.

1479
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:48,185
You stole the cardinal's driver?

1480
01:29:48,285 --> 01:29:50,421
That's what he gets
for messin´ with our girlfriend.

1481
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:52,255
Cross-dressin´ fuck.

1482
01:29:52,355 --> 01:29:54,791
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1483
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,496
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1484
01:29:59,563 --> 01:30:02,733
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill 'em.

1485
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:04,935
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1486
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:09,272
They won't be killed.

1487
01:30:09,372 --> 01:30:12,408
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1488
01:30:12,508 --> 01:30:13,743
right here...

1489
01:30:13,843 --> 01:30:16,879
until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1490
01:30:18,015 --> 01:30:20,049
There's only one idiot here,
Azrael...

1491
01:30:23,386 --> 01:30:25,522
and I'm looking right at him.

1492
01:30:25,622 --> 01:30:27,123
Muse!

1493
01:30:28,491 --> 01:30:31,594
Just in time to join us
for a drink.

1494
01:30:33,096 --> 01:30:34,163
Hey.
Where'd you come from?

1495
01:30:36,032 --> 01:30:37,968
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1496
01:30:38,034 --> 01:30:39,536
Nothingness.

1497
01:30:39,636 --> 01:30:43,340
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1498
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,977
All right, Plato,
sounds like you've had enough already.

1499
01:30:47,077 --> 01:30:49,545
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1500
01:30:49,645 --> 01:30:53,282
Come on, barkeep,just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1501
01:30:53,382 --> 01:30:56,485
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1502
01:30:56,585 --> 01:30:58,321
Is that who I think it is?

1503
01:30:58,421 --> 01:30:59,689
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1504
01:30:59,789 --> 01:31:02,525
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1505
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,760
Give me a...

1506
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,329
Holy Bartender.

1507
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,298
Never heard of it.

1508
01:31:09,365 --> 01:31:13,203
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1509
01:31:13,303 --> 01:31:15,237
You do, don't you, Muse?

1510
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:16,339
Don't.

1511
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:18,607
Anybody?

1512
01:31:18,707 --> 01:31:20,176
No?

1513
01:31:20,276 --> 01:31:23,779
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1514
01:31:32,388 --> 01:31:33,456
Get it?

1515
01:31:33,556 --> 01:31:35,791
Sweet Jesus, Azrael!
Why?

1516
01:31:35,891 --> 01:31:39,395
Come on, Demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1517
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:42,931
Oh, Apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1518
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:46,002
and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1519
01:31:46,102 --> 01:31:48,237
The Christ bitch will join you.

1520
01:31:48,337 --> 01:31:51,473
are you really that stupid?

1521
01:31:51,573 --> 01:31:55,077
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1522
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:57,512
I'm actually counting on it.

1523
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,916
And if my calculations
are correct...

1524
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:03,719
the pawns are moving into checkmate
as we speak.

1525
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:12,227
" Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1526
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:16,531
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1527
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:18,400
for coming this morning.

1528
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,436
She's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1529
01:32:23,105 --> 01:32:27,776
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1530
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:30,511
hundred-years-young house of God.

1531
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:31,880
God's house?

1532
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:35,984
God doesn't live here anymore.

1533
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:38,854
He's grown weary
ofyour superficial faith.

1534
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:41,889
He's turned a deafear
to your lip-service prayers.

1535
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:45,259
- He has abandoned you, his favorites...
- Sorry.

1536
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:47,295
to the whim of judgment.

1537
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:49,865
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1538
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,168
prepare to taste God's wrath.

1539
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:57,206
-Maybe we should just leave.
-You wanted your body count. You got it.

1540
01:32:57,272 --> 01:32:59,874
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1541
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,209
Officer McGhee.

1542
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:03,778
All right, mouth piece...

1543
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:06,647
let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1544
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,116
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1545
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:11,152
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

1546
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:13,053
Is that so?

1547
01:33:17,357 --> 01:33:19,093
Ladies and gentlemen...

1548
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:24,665
you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1549
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:27,135
and this very day...

1550
01:33:27,235 --> 01:33:30,971
I assure you you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1551
01:33:31,071 --> 01:33:32,806
in blood.

1552
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:35,176
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1553
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:36,310
Do it!

1554
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:40,247
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1555
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:45,319
He was kicked out.

1556
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:47,889
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1557
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:49,022
Then what happened?

1558
01:33:49,122 --> 01:33:51,258
Yes, what?

1559
01:33:51,358 --> 01:33:55,295
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1560
01:33:55,395 --> 01:33:57,931
Heaven became divided
into two factions--

1561
01:33:58,031 --> 01:34:00,200
the faithful and the renegades.

1562
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:03,104
Oh, the Ethereal Plains
were chaotic with battle.

1563
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:05,974
Angel against angel.

1564
01:34:06,074 --> 01:34:09,510
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1565
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,478
But Azrael refused to fight.

1566
01:34:11,544 --> 01:34:15,015
He remained in the middle,
waiting to see who came out victorious.

1567
01:34:15,115 --> 01:34:17,184
What are you,
some kind of fuckin´ chicken?

1568
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:18,552
No.

1569
01:34:18,652 --> 01:34:20,488
I was an artist...

1570
01:34:20,587 --> 01:34:22,688
stupid!

1571
01:34:22,789 --> 01:34:24,424
I was inspiration!

1572
01:34:24,524 --> 01:34:26,994
A muse has no place in battle.

1573
01:34:27,094 --> 01:34:29,795
So after the fallen
were banished to Hell...

1574
01:34:29,895 --> 01:34:31,832
God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1575
01:34:31,898 --> 01:34:34,234
and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1576
01:34:34,334 --> 01:34:37,102
something he considers
a great injustice.

1577
01:34:37,203 --> 01:34:39,339
Oh, come on.

1578
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:42,476
Don't tell meyou never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1579
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:45,312
No.
It never bothered me.

1580
01:34:45,412 --> 01:34:47,413
Soyou were an artist.

1581
01:34:47,513 --> 01:34:49,249
Big deal!

1582
01:34:49,349 --> 01:34:51,384
Elvis was an artist...

1583
01:34:51,484 --> 01:34:54,821
but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time o fwar.

1584
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,856
That's why he is the king...

1585
01:34:56,923 --> 01:34:58,857
and you're a schmuck.

1586
01:34:58,925 --> 01:35:00,060
Nice.

1587
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,061
So all this is about revenge.

1588
01:35:02,127 --> 01:35:05,098
You're gonna unmake existence
because you have a grudge against God?

1589
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:08,934
After the first million years?
No.

1590
01:35:09,035 --> 01:35:12,839
Escape from Hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1591
01:35:12,938 --> 01:35:17,410
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1592
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:19,011
which it finally did...

1593
01:35:19,112 --> 01:35:21,080
in Catholicism.

1594
01:35:21,147 --> 01:35:22,382
Plenary indulgence.

1595
01:35:22,482 --> 01:35:24,383
But I couldn't exercise it.

1596
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:26,919
Demons can't become human.

1597
01:35:26,985 --> 01:35:29,122
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1598
01:35:30,623 --> 01:35:32,091
But angels can.

1599
01:35:33,326 --> 01:35:34,626
Bartleby and Loki.

1600
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:39,365
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1601
01:35:39,465 --> 01:35:41,233
to celebrate their centennial...

1602
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:46,939
and when that finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1603
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:48,974
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1604
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,143
kept them cloaked
and off Heaven's radars.

1605
01:35:51,243 --> 01:35:54,380
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1606
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:58,250
no soul in Hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1607
01:35:58,350 --> 01:36:01,320
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1608
01:36:01,421 --> 01:36:04,890
so I dispatched Him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1609
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:07,425
Her. And how?

1610
01:36:07,492 --> 01:36:10,061
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1611
01:36:10,162 --> 01:36:13,098
Oh, no, I've seen
way too many Bond movies to know...

1612
01:36:13,165 --> 01:36:16,102
that you never reveal
all the details ofyour plan...

1613
01:36:16,168 --> 01:36:19,605
no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1614
01:36:19,672 --> 01:36:22,841
The only "X" factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1615
01:36:24,209 --> 01:36:28,280
But fat lot ofgood that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1616
01:36:31,082 --> 01:36:34,219
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1617
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:38,423
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1618
01:36:38,523 --> 01:36:42,393
but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1619
01:36:42,494 --> 01:36:45,464
Human, haveyou ever been to Hell?

1620
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:47,699
I think not.

1621
01:36:47,799 --> 01:36:50,035
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1622
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:54,438
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1623
01:36:54,538 --> 01:36:57,041
Still thinking only about yourself...

1624
01:36:57,142 --> 01:36:59,078
you fucking child!

1625
01:36:59,144 --> 01:37:01,212
Now, now, now.

1626
01:37:02,113 --> 01:37:05,116
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1627
01:37:05,216 --> 01:37:07,752
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1628
01:37:07,852 --> 01:37:09,821
Yo, put on channel 9.
Davey and Goliath.

1629
01:37:11,221 --> 01:37:15,627
Actually, I was thinking
more along the lines of current events.

1630
01:37:15,693 --> 01:37:18,095
Keep rolling!Keep rolling!

1631
01:37:18,196 --> 01:37:21,033
I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...

1632
01:37:21,132 --> 01:37:23,267
have laid waste toSt. Michael's!

1633
01:37:23,367 --> 01:37:25,703
Bullets don't seem to affect them!

1634
01:37:26,538 --> 01:37:29,473
The remainder of the crowd
have dropped to theirknees...

1635
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,877
identifying this
as the fable da pocalypse.

1636
01:37:31,976 --> 01:37:34,812
Now, I'm notaman of faith,
butl'm inclined to agree.

1637
01:37:34,912 --> 01:37:39,084
Oh, God, please, don't come any closer!
God, no!

1638
01:37:47,191 --> 01:37:50,394
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1639
01:37:50,494 --> 01:37:54,064
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not going to matter anyway.

1640
01:37:58,235 --> 01:37:59,236
Oh?

1641
01:38:00,739 --> 01:38:03,140
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1642
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,842
What?

1643
01:38:04,942 --> 01:38:07,411
Oh, nothing.

1644
01:38:07,511 --> 01:38:09,647
I had something in my eye.

1645
01:38:09,747 --> 01:38:12,483
Now who's the fucking child?

1646
01:38:13,684 --> 01:38:16,854
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1647
01:38:17,554 --> 01:38:21,191
are you serious? I'm a fucking demon.
You'd have him assault me with a putter?

1648
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,328
You want to play?
Then we'll play.

1649
01:38:24,427 --> 01:38:26,196
One side, Red.

1650
01:38:26,964 --> 01:38:28,632
Go ahead, then.
Pick it up.

1651
01:38:28,732 --> 01:38:29,866
Call it a gift.

1652
01:38:31,368 --> 01:38:33,337
Come on.

1653
01:38:33,436 --> 01:38:34,838
That's it.

1654
01:38:36,406 --> 01:38:37,974
Take a shot.

1655
01:38:38,074 --> 01:38:41,644
Take your best fucking shot.

1656
01:38:43,146 --> 01:38:45,515
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1657
01:38:46,716 --> 01:38:48,652
Come on, bright boy.

1658
01:38:56,492 --> 01:38:59,229
Don't you know anything?

1659
01:39:14,744 --> 01:39:16,680
Bethany, bless the sink!

1660
01:39:16,745 --> 01:39:18,580
- What?
-Just do it!

1661
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,650
Bless the sink, damn it!

1662
01:39:44,941 --> 01:39:47,109
That's what you get,
motherfucker.

1663
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,848
But I'm a fucking demon.

1664
01:39:59,188 --> 01:40:00,423
What just happened?

1665
01:40:00,523 --> 01:40:03,159
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1666
01:40:03,259 --> 01:40:07,596
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side so it'll do some damage.

1667
01:40:07,696 --> 01:40:09,731
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1668
01:40:09,831 --> 01:40:13,769
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1669
01:40:13,836 --> 01:40:16,872
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1670
01:40:16,972 --> 01:40:19,207
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1671
01:40:19,308 --> 01:40:21,743
Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing
at my next party.

1672
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:24,980
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about ten miles.

1673
01:40:25,081 --> 01:40:27,015
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1674
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:29,284
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1675
01:40:29,384 --> 01:40:32,587
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1676
01:40:44,432 --> 01:40:46,101
Oh, my God.

1677
01:40:58,913 --> 01:41:01,616
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1678
01:41:01,716 --> 01:41:02,951
Are we too late?

1679
01:41:03,051 --> 01:41:05,620
To save these poor schmucks?

1680
01:41:07,422 --> 01:41:08,490
Yeah.

1681
01:41:08,591 --> 01:41:11,226
But we still exist.

1682
01:41:11,326 --> 01:41:13,128
Where are they?

1683
01:41:13,227 --> 01:41:15,698
They could already be
in the church.

1684
01:41:15,798 --> 01:41:17,865
Which means if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1685
01:41:17,965 --> 01:41:19,368
are you shitting me?

1686
01:41:19,468 --> 01:41:23,471
The brother here is gonna shred 'em with
his angel-be-good special. Huh, homey?

1687
01:41:23,571 --> 01:41:25,506
If they pass through that arch,
they come out clean.

1688
01:41:25,573 --> 01:41:27,675
And if they die,
they go straight up.

1689
01:41:27,775 --> 01:41:30,178
And hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1690
01:41:30,278 --> 01:41:32,647
- Why don't theyjust kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1691
01:41:32,747 --> 01:41:35,550
Die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They don't want to go to hell.

1692
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:39,486
Then what, are we supposed to just wait
for a solution to fall from the sky?

1693
01:41:43,724 --> 01:41:45,059
Friend of yours?

1694
01:41:45,159 --> 01:41:47,094
No, that was a cardinal.

1695
01:41:47,161 --> 01:41:50,964
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1696
01:41:51,065 --> 01:41:53,634
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1697
01:41:53,734 --> 01:41:54,969
Don't you listen?

1698
01:41:55,070 --> 01:41:58,039
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1699
01:41:58,139 --> 01:42:00,407
He's been at it for a while now.

1700
01:42:00,507 --> 01:42:02,076
Please! Please!

1701
01:42:03,277 --> 01:42:05,178
We ran out of parishioners...

1702
01:42:05,278 --> 01:42:09,584
so hejust started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping 'em.

1703
01:42:09,684 --> 01:42:12,887
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1704
01:42:13,921 --> 01:42:16,022
If only they'd let us jerk off.

1705
01:42:17,424 --> 01:42:19,159
Whoops.
Take a step back.

1706
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:24,932
Let me go!

1707
01:42:26,099 --> 01:42:28,369
Why?
What are you trying to prove?

1708
01:42:28,469 --> 01:42:31,838
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1709
01:42:32,872 --> 01:42:34,274
Jesus Christ!

1710
01:42:35,642 --> 01:42:37,577
I just wanted to go home.

1711
01:42:37,644 --> 01:42:39,446
But him, you know...

1712
01:42:39,546 --> 01:42:41,915
he just lost it.

1713
01:42:42,015 --> 01:42:45,218
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1714
01:42:45,318 --> 01:42:46,754
He just snapped.

1715
01:42:46,854 --> 01:42:50,458
The funny thing is, this guy
could never even stand to see me work.

1716
01:42:50,558 --> 01:42:53,627
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1717
01:42:54,694 --> 01:42:56,229
Now look at him.

1718
01:42:56,329 --> 01:42:58,364
This guy's fuckin´ drunker than hell.

1719
01:42:58,465 --> 01:43:00,934
Which means he's human now.

1720
01:43:02,336 --> 01:43:04,404
His wings have been cut off.

1721
01:43:11,045 --> 01:43:12,979
The muse?

1722
01:43:13,046 --> 01:43:15,114
Oh, no way!

1723
01:43:15,214 --> 01:43:17,984
I haven't seen you--
You look terrific. Wow!

1724
01:43:18,084 --> 01:43:20,219
What's with the tits?
Can l--

1725
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,555
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1726
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:29,496
Tell me. Have you gone in
and come out through the archway yet?

1727
01:43:29,595 --> 01:43:30,930
No!

1728
01:43:36,035 --> 01:43:37,437
He's back.

1729
01:44:00,793 --> 01:44:02,729
We were awaiting your arrival.

1730
01:44:02,795 --> 01:44:05,831
Bartleby, wait. Stop.
Listen to me.

1731
01:44:05,932 --> 01:44:08,634
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1732
01:44:08,734 --> 01:44:09,969
If you go back--

1733
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:13,839
I've become aware of the repercussions.
I know what I'm doing.

1734
01:44:15,307 --> 01:44:16,976
You sick, twisted fuck!

1735
01:44:18,576 --> 01:44:19,813
Bethany.

1736
01:44:23,015 --> 00:00:00,000
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1737
01:44:26,418 --> 01:44:29,320
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1738
01:44:29,421 --> 01:44:32,458
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1739
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:35,627
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1740
01:44:35,727 --> 01:44:40,165
While you never see your ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his new wife--

1741
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:42,968
and he is--

1742
01:44:46,171 --> 01:44:50,875
seeing you people every day on this
perfect world He created for you...

1743
01:44:50,975 --> 01:44:52,677
is a constant reminder...

1744
01:44:52,777 --> 01:44:55,814
that though my kind came fiirst...

1745
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:57,983
your kind was most revered.

1746
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,586
And while you know forgiveness...

1747
01:45:01,686 --> 01:45:03,622
we know only regret.

1748
01:45:04,689 --> 01:45:06,492
The lesson must be taught.

1749
01:45:06,592 --> 01:45:08,527
All are accountable...

1750
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:09,828
even God.

1751
01:45:11,129 --> 01:45:13,298
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1752
01:45:13,398 --> 01:45:16,634
just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1753
01:45:17,902 --> 01:45:21,373
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1754
01:45:21,474 --> 01:45:22,941
will cease to be.

1755
01:45:23,041 --> 01:45:24,576
No. Hey. Hey!

1756
01:45:27,312 --> 01:45:29,214
I can't let you do that,
Bartleby.

1757
01:45:29,314 --> 01:45:31,382
This has gone too far.

1758
01:45:33,384 --> 01:45:35,788
I might have to take you down.

1759
01:45:37,355 --> 01:45:39,157
It's okay. Shh.

1760
01:45:39,257 --> 01:45:40,824
I'll do it.

1761
01:45:45,629 --> 01:45:47,566
My compatriot.

1762
01:45:48,899 --> 01:45:51,435
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1763
01:45:51,535 --> 01:45:52,770
He's weakened.

1764
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:54,305
You're weak.

1765
01:45:54,405 --> 01:45:57,208
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1766
01:45:57,308 --> 01:45:59,476
a condition which carries
two liabilities--

1767
01:46:01,311 --> 01:46:03,080
a conscience...

1768
01:46:03,915 --> 01:46:05,316
and...

1769
01:46:08,353 --> 01:46:10,921
a short life span.

1770
01:46:11,022 --> 01:46:13,791
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1771
01:46:41,585 --> 01:46:43,521
He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1772
01:46:43,587 --> 01:46:45,856
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1773
01:46:47,257 --> 01:46:48,659
I can't believe this.

1774
01:46:48,759 --> 01:46:51,362
We're on the brink of non existence,
and God's still nowhere to be found.

1775
01:46:51,462 --> 01:46:54,531
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1776
01:47:01,438 --> 01:47:03,540
What the hell are you doing?

1777
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:07,143
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1778
01:47:11,214 --> 01:47:14,117
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1779
01:47:14,217 --> 01:47:17,788
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1780
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:20,823
- or we can get makin´ with the love.
- What did you say?

1781
01:47:20,891 --> 01:47:22,959
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1782
01:47:23,059 --> 01:47:24,561
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1783
01:47:28,398 --> 01:47:31,368
That guy, the one they won't take
off life support--John Doe Jersey.

1784
01:47:31,468 --> 01:47:33,503
This is where he's at--
St. Michael's Hospital.

1785
01:47:35,072 --> 01:47:36,505
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1786
01:47:36,606 --> 01:47:39,209
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1787
01:47:39,309 --> 01:47:41,745
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1788
01:47:41,845 --> 01:47:43,880
- Have you ever been there?
- Once, with this chick.

1789
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:46,983
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1790
01:47:47,083 --> 01:47:48,918
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1791
01:47:52,355 --> 01:47:54,256
That's what I'm talkin´ about.

1792
01:48:02,297 --> 01:48:05,367
What ever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1793
01:48:05,468 --> 01:48:07,604
Bob, come with me.
Come on!

1794
01:48:07,703 --> 01:48:10,372
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1795
01:48:10,473 --> 01:48:12,675
I already did,
but it takes two of us!

1796
01:48:13,542 --> 01:48:15,745
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1797
01:48:15,845 --> 01:48:17,613
This is the apocalypse.

1798
01:48:17,713 --> 01:48:20,416
Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.

1799
01:48:20,516 --> 01:48:22,251
Thank you.

1800
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:39,302
Hey, Big Bird!

1801
01:48:40,202 --> 01:48:41,871
Ready for the counting game?

1802
01:48:46,675 --> 01:48:48,644
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1803
01:49:16,838 --> 01:49:18,807
No more bullets.

1804
01:49:18,874 --> 01:49:21,042
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1805
01:49:21,142 --> 01:49:24,045
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1806
01:49:24,146 --> 01:49:26,181
You just did him a favor,
stupid!

1807
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,630
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1808
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:59,173
Oh, Bartleby.

1809
01:50:59,272 --> 01:51:02,909
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1810
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:05,078
Bow down, stupid!

1811
01:51:23,663 --> 01:51:25,565
I'm sorry.

1812
01:51:47,987 --> 01:51:51,158
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1813
01:51:51,258 --> 01:51:54,995
would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1814
01:51:55,095 --> 01:51:57,130
What the fuck?

1815
01:52:03,302 --> 01:52:05,305
Thank you.

1816
01:52:37,136 --> 01:52:38,771
It never ends!

1817
01:52:58,823 --> 01:53:00,893
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1818
01:53:00,993 --> 01:53:03,463
What the fuck is this shit?

1819
01:53:03,563 --> 01:53:05,264
Who the fuck are you, lady?

1820
01:53:05,364 --> 01:53:07,800
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1821
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:10,803
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1822
01:53:10,903 --> 01:53:13,873
What the fuck is this, The Piano?
Why ain't this broad talkin´?

1823
01:53:13,939 --> 01:53:19,244
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1824
01:53:19,344 --> 01:53:22,614
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fuckin´ nuts?

1825
01:53:22,715 --> 01:53:25,684
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head?

1826
01:53:25,751 --> 01:53:27,719
Shh.

1827
01:53:43,269 --> 01:53:44,936
Where was she?

1828
01:53:45,036 --> 01:53:47,572
Imprisoned in a body.

1829
01:53:47,672 --> 01:53:50,576
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1830
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:53,678
Hang on a minute.

1831
01:54:28,178 --> 01:54:30,081
You missed a bit.

1832
01:54:31,649 --> 01:54:34,552
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1833
01:54:34,652 --> 01:54:37,088
You ready to make some of those
changes I been talking about?

1834
01:54:37,188 --> 01:54:38,323
We'll see.

1835
01:54:38,423 --> 01:54:39,956
Muse?

1836
01:54:40,057 --> 01:54:42,626
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1837
01:54:42,726 --> 01:54:44,962
you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1838
01:54:45,062 --> 01:54:47,965
First I gotta say good-bye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1839
01:54:48,066 --> 01:54:49,466
Oh, no.

1840
01:55:10,754 --> 01:55:13,190
Metatron, is she--

1841
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:15,593
Afraid so.

1842
01:55:15,692 --> 01:55:19,662
One of the drawbacks to being a martyr
is that you have to die.

1843
01:55:19,762 --> 01:55:22,299
But no matter.

1844
01:55:31,843 --> 01:55:33,743
All is being taken care of.

1845
01:55:34,878 --> 01:55:36,280
How so?

1846
01:55:37,447 --> 01:55:40,517
Wax on, wax off.

1847
01:56:04,107 --> 01:56:05,208
How did l--

1848
01:56:05,307 --> 01:56:06,976
She can rebuild you.

1849
01:56:07,077 --> 01:56:08,645
She has the technology.

1850
01:56:08,745 --> 01:56:12,815
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1851
01:56:18,622 --> 01:56:19,722
That's...

1852
01:56:20,823 --> 01:56:23,593
A very relieved deity.

1853
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:28,064
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come 'round.

1854
01:56:28,164 --> 01:56:30,567
Your kind always does.

1855
01:56:31,801 --> 01:56:34,237
You might want to
take good care of yourself.

1856
01:56:34,337 --> 01:56:37,106
We're gonna need you down the road.

1857
01:56:37,207 --> 01:56:39,642
I know.
I'm the last scion.

1858
01:56:42,344 --> 01:56:45,448
Well, you're half right.

1859
01:56:45,548 --> 01:56:48,451
You were the last scion.

1860
01:56:50,219 --> 01:56:51,621
But now...

1861
01:56:52,721 --> 01:56:54,223
this...

1862
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:57,059
is the last scion.

1863
01:57:00,129 --> 01:57:02,032
I'm pregnant?

1864
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:06,535
Can't put anything past you.

1865
01:57:09,872 --> 01:57:12,374
Take care of that parcel for us.

1866
01:57:12,474 --> 01:57:16,379
She has a world ofwork
ahead ofher.

1867
01:57:27,823 --> 01:57:29,858
Thank you for...

1868
01:57:29,958 --> 01:57:31,927
I don't know...

1869
01:57:32,026 --> 01:57:33,261
everything.

1870
01:57:37,032 --> 01:57:40,435
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1871
01:57:40,535 --> 01:57:44,573
most of it questioning your great plan,
and that'd be arrogant of me, I know.

1872
01:57:45,374 --> 01:57:47,475
But there is one I need to ask.

1873
01:57:47,575 --> 01:57:51,179
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1874
01:57:53,182 --> 01:57:55,116
Why are we here?

1875
01:58:11,732 --> 01:58:14,636
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1876
01:58:21,543 --> 01:58:24,111
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1877
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,015
It was an honor.

1878
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:34,621
You did so well.

1879
01:58:39,294 --> 01:58:42,196
I told you She was a woman.

1880
01:58:44,165 --> 01:58:46,534
She's not really a woman.

1881
01:58:46,634 --> 01:58:49,069
She's not really anything.

1882
01:58:49,169 --> 01:58:50,805
She's something, all right.

1883
01:58:52,039 --> 01:58:54,241
Crisis of faith over?

1884
01:58:54,341 --> 01:58:57,245
I think I'm now burdened
with an over abundance.

1885
01:58:57,345 --> 01:58:59,246
When it rains, it pours.

1886
01:58:59,346 --> 01:59:01,549
are you saying you believe?

1887
01:59:02,883 --> 01:59:04,852
But I have a good idea.

1888
01:59:04,953 --> 01:59:06,353
Yes!

1889
01:59:10,324 --> 01:59:12,226
The Man was right about you.

1890
01:59:12,326 --> 01:59:15,330
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell Him so.

1891
01:59:16,263 --> 01:59:18,165
And if you clean up your language...

1892
01:59:18,265 --> 01:59:20,701
I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1893
01:59:20,801 --> 01:59:22,369
Thanks.

1894
01:59:23,937 --> 01:59:26,340
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1895
01:59:29,209 --> 01:59:30,945
Rufus.

1896
01:59:57,370 --> 01:59:59,773
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1897
02:00:04,644 --> 02:00:06,546
Youse guys
wanna hear something sick?

1898
02:00:06,646 --> 02:00:09,550
I got half a stalk
when she kissed me.

1899
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:12,051
I couldn't help it.
The bitch was hot.

1900
02:00:12,151 --> 02:00:16,690
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1901
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:18,258
You're pregnant?

1902
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:23,463
You know, when you're pregnant you can
have sex until the third trimester.

1903
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:25,465
I'll keep that in mind.
