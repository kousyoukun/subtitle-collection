1
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:10,196
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving force
behind atholicism WOW!, Cardinal Glick.

2
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,439
Thank you

3
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,449
Now we all know
how the majority...

4
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,781
and the media in this country...

5
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,116
view the Catholic church.

6
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,282
They think of us as a passe,
archaic institution.

7
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,589
People find the Bible obtuse...

8
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:34,151
even hokey.

9
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,322
Now, in an effort to disprove
all that...

10
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:40,129
the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

11
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,170
both offaith and of style.

12
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,303
For example, the crucifix.

13
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,002
While it has been a time-honored symbol
of our faith...

14
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:51,136
Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

15
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,805
this highly recognizable...

16
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,179
yet wholly depressing image...

17
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,445
of our Lord, crucified.

18
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,886
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

19
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,821
He came to help us out.

20
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,588
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

21
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:09,426
that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring Sigil.

22
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:13,428
So, it is with great pleasure
that I presentyou with the first...

23
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:16,164
of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow!. campaign...

24
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,674
will unveil over the nextyear,
I giveyou...

25
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,969
"The Buddy Christ.""

26
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,846
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

27
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,322
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

28
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:37,790
But look at it.

29
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,691
Doesn't it pop?.

30
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,388
Buddy Christ.

31
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:43,588
Well, thereyou have it.

32
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,565
Let me get this straight.

33
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:49,229
You don't believe in God
because of Alice in Wonderland?.

34
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:51,329
No, Through the Looking Glass.

35
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:53,340
That poem,
""The Walrus and the Carpenter""...

36
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:55,638
that's an indictment
of organized religion.

37
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:57,736
The Walrus, with his girth
and his good nature...

38
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,838
he obviously represents either Buddha...

39
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:02,941
orwith his tusks,
the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

40
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:05,009
That takes care
ofyour Eastern religions.

41
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:07,817
Now, the Carpenter, which is
an obvious reference toJesus Christ...

42
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,519
who was raised a carpenter's son,
he represents the Western religions.

43
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:14,061
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?.

44
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,689
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

45
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:20,531
and then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

46
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:23,537
I don't know what that says toyou,
but to me it says...

47
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:27,371
that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

48
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,172
ensures the destruction
of one's inner-being.

49
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:32,338
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

50
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:35,247
by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

51
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,684
out offear ofsome
intangible parent figure...

52
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:41,746
who shakes a finger at us
from thousands ofyears ago...

53
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,725
and says, "" Do it--
Do it and I'll fuckin' spankyou!""

54
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:47,159
Oh,Jesus!

55
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:50,824
The wayyou put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

56
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,224
What have I been doing
with my life?.

57
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,695
- What am I?.
- Yeah, I know.

58
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:59,570
Listen, my advice toyou...

59
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:02,201
you take this money thatyou've
been collecting foryour parish...

60
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:05,474
go getyourself a nice dress,
fixyourself up.

61
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:08,778
Find some man-- find some woman--you
can connect with, even for a moment...

62
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,944
'cause that's really all life is,
Sister-- a series of moments.

63
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,022
Why don'tyou seizeyours?.

64
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,659
That a girl.

65
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,603
You know, here's what
I don't get aboutyou.

66
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:32,504
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

67
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:35,407
You've been in His presence.
He's spoken toyou personally.

68
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:38,708
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuckwith the clergy, man.

69
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,216
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

70
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:44,218
Here's what I don't get aboutyou.

71
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:47,050
Why doyou feel the need
to come to this place all the time?.

72
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:49,590
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

73
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:50,852
Look at them.

74
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:54,794
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

75
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:58,799
forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get offthe plane.

76
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,129
See those two?.

77
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:03,501
What that guy doesn't know is that the
girl cheated on him while she was away.

78
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,506
- She did?.
- Twice.

79
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,735
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

80
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,744
'cause they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

81
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:13,075
I like that.

82
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:15,446
I wish they all could
feel that way more often.

83
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:18,680
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?.

84
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,188
You call me, you tell me
it's important.

85
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,714
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?.

86
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,852
We're going home.

87
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,192
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

88
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:37,133
Take it and quit leering at me. People
will think I just broke upwith you.

89
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:40,641
- You said we're going home, didn'tyou?.
- Read.

90
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:44,702
""Cardinal GlickCuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign.""

91
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,247
And?.

92
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:50,011
You have to keep reading.

93
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:52,212
""The rededication of
St. Michael's Church...""

94
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,687
...is the kickoffofa new campaign
which seeks to bring...

95
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:56,587
Catholicism into the mainstream.

96
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:59,183
With a papal sanction,
the archway entrance...

97
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:01,729
ofthe century-oldJersey shore
house ofworship...

98
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,197
will serve as a passageway
ofplenary indulgence--

99
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:07,599
a little-known Catholic belief offering
all that passes through its arches...

100
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:09,534
a morally clean slate.

101
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:12,767
For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

102
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:16,333
Al I I gotta do, I wal k through the arch
thi ng, and then I can go back home?.

103
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:19,903
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

104
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,609
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die?. I don't wanna die.

105
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:26,450
- You rather hang around here?.
- No. We don't know ifwe can die.

106
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:29,615
But what ifwe can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?.

107
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,488
What then, Hell?.
Fuck that.

108
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,494
It's impossible.
Ifwe cut off ourwings...

109
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:36,998
and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

110
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:39,533
Ifwe die with clean souls,
there's nowaythey can keep us out.

111
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:42,729
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

112
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:46,205
- Who sent the paper?.
- Who cares who sent the paper?.

113
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:49,368
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

114
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:51,378
He can't keep us out anymore.

115
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:53,380
Once we're back in,
it'll be forgive and forget.

116
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:55,541
But this thing,
this is Church law.

117
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:57,482
It's not Divine Mandate.

118
00:07:57,552 --> 00:08:01,147
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:04,659
One ofthe last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:08,287
by the Son ofGod
before He left was...

121
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,560
- ""Whateveryou hold true on Earth--""
- "" I'll hold true in Heaven.""

122
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,693
It's dogmatic law. Ifthe Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

123
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,430
This thing has a papal sanction--

124
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:19,406
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

125
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:21,408
neveryielded positive results.

126
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:23,569
You can't be anal retentive
ifyou don't have an anus.

127
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,909
Outstanding work!

128
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:28,882
There's just one thing
I thinkwe gotta do before we leave.

129
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,077
This is gonna help us get back
on His good side.

130
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:32,313
What?.

131
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,254
Here. I've been dreaming about this
for fiveyears. Read that.

132
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:36,790
"" Mooby, the Golden Calf.

133
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:39,622
Creating an Empire
Out ofSimplicity."

134
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:41,594
I wanna hit 'em.

135
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:44,393
You really are
just a simple creature.

136
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:46,764
We finallyfind a way back
and you want to jeopardize that...

137
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:48,928
becauseyou've got a soft spot
for the good ol' days.

138
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:52,462
What betterway to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

139
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,031
thanks to you?.

140
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:57,169
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

141
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,146
Killing spree?.
I'm talking about DivineJustice here.

142
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:03,548
I'm talking about reigning down fire
and brimstone, punishing thewicked.

143
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:06,246
He's all about that.
I know He'd want this done.

144
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:09,017
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
sinceyou quit.

145
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,682
Doesn't that mean anything toyou?.

146
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,626
And besides, what ifyou're wrong,
likeyou always are?.

147
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:16,323
IfI'm wrong-- which I'm not--
it's not gonna matter.

148
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:18,662
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

149
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,566
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

150
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:25,333
Well, He does hate competition.
I will say that.

151
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:27,705
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

152
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,801
Where is this church
we have to go to?.

153
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:33,177
NewJersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

154
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:35,216
Last four days on Earth?.

155
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,649
Ifl had a dick,
I'd go get laid.

156
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,846
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?.

157
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:41,786
Let's kill people.

158
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,448
Oh, notyou.

159
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:53,925
The greater Illinois Chapter
ofthe Right to Life Foundation...

160
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:56,300
will be holding its
biannual softball game...

161
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,838
against the Cook County...

162
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:00,306
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2::00.

163
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,775
T oday's second col lection
wi I l be donated...

164
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,677
to the J ohn Doe J ersey Life Fund.

165
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:08,113
For those ofyou
who haven't been following the news...

166
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:10,276
an unidentified homeless man...

167
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:14,482
who was accosted and severely beaten
at the NewJersey shore last Tuesday...

168
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:18,686
Iies in critical, but stable condition
in one ofthat area's hospitals.

169
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,557
He lacks identification...

170
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:24,121
and police have had no luck tracking
down any possible family.

171
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:28,602
The archbishop ofthe Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

172
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,901
to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

173
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,703
asking that Catholics
all over the country...

174
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,904
join in this protest against euthanasia.

175
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,406
Well, now please rise
for the recession offaith.

176
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:47,947
We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty...

177
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,547
Maker of Heaven and Earth.

178
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:52,718
We believe inJesus Christ,
His onlySon, Our Lord--

179
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:55,660
Choose life!

180
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,188
You're gonna burn in Hell,
ya fuckin' baby killer!

181
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,064
Holy shit. It's the pope.

182
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,535
- Huh?.
- Where?.

183
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:03,935
What are you talking about?.

184
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:16,911
Jesus! You're a Catholic.
Can'tyou talk to them?.

185
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:19,112
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

186
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:22,054
At leastyou have an excuse. You're
Jewish. You don't know any better.

187
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:25,615
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

188
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:27,753
Where wereyou yesterday?.
We went to brunch.

189
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:29,194
I went to church.

190
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:31,198
That still kills me,
you and church.

191
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,793
If only they knewyourweekly tithing
came from a Planned Parenthood check.

192
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:37,303
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

193
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:42,202
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

194
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:45,508
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

195
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,014
I don't think I have any faith left.

196
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:52,219
Remember that seminary student
I tried to setyou up with?.

197
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,691
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have baby-sat for in high school.

198
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,125
The point is,
he told me something.

199
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,755
He said that faith
is like a glass ofwater.

200
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:05,800
When you'reyoung, the glass is little,
so it's easyto fill.

201
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,801
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

202
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,894
The same amount ofliquid
doesn't fill it anymore.

203
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:12,804
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

204
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:14,774
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?.

205
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:16,071
In moreways than one.

206
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:20,581
You need to get laid, Bethany Sloane.
You need a man, if only for 1 0 minutes.

207
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:23,481
It's been my experience that
the average male is never a man...

208
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:25,951
not even for ten minutes
in his entire life span.

209
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,955
That sounds militant. Areyou thinking
ofjoining the other side?.

210
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:30,923
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

211
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:34,189
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

212
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:36,196
I think God is dead.

213
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,698
The sign ofa true Catholic.

214
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:52,510
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

215
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,275
I'm from the EPA.

216
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,284
We're checking on possible
freon leaks.

217
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:00,685
Tell me,
doyou have air conditioning?.

218
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:02,450
Yes, we have central air.

219
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:04,151
In every room?.

220
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:06,022
Except the bathroom.
Why?.

221
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:08,119
Well, you do know
what that means, don'tyou?.

222
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:21,066
Move!

223
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:31,311
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

224
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:34,350
than central air.

225
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:37,217
Pick that up.

226
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:44,493
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

227
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,467
Now, ifl remember
the protocol correctly...

228
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,968
the powers...

229
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,438
will attempt to contact
the last scion.

230
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:54,668
I need you three...

231
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:57,870
to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

232
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,009
Go.

233
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:39,685
Behold the Metatron!

234
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,552
Herald ofthe Almighty
and voice ofthe one true God!

235
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:45,320
Behold the Metatron!

236
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:49,454
Herald ofthe Almighty
and voice ofthe one true God!

237
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:08,914
SweetJesus!
Doyou have to use the whole can?.

238
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:12,009
Who the fuck areyou and
what the fuck areyou doing in my room?.

239
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:14,919
I'm the one that's soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

240
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:16,957
Stupid fucking--

241
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,357
Get the fuck out ofhere,
now!

242
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:22,055
Oryou'll do what exactly?.

243
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,325
Hit me with that fish?.

244
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,196
Now,just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

245
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:34,867
Jesus wept!

246
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:36,706
Look at my suit.

247
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:40,610
Just take whateveryou want,
but don't kill or rape me.

248
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:45,085
Give over! I couldn't rapeyou
ifl wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

249
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:48,778
See?.

250
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:54,292
I'm as anatomically-impaired
as a Ken doll.

251
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:57,558
Makeyourselfuseful
and give me that towel.

252
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,032
You bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

253
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:03,798
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

254
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,463
What areyou?.

255
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,565
I'm pissed offis what I am.

256
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:11,703
Doyou drench everyone who comes in your
room with flame-retardant chemicals?.

257
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:14,646
No wonderyou're single.

258
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,878
Stand back.

259
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,221
As I was sayin'...

260
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:34,530
prior toyour fire-fighting episode...

261
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:38,067
I am the Metatron.

262
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:43,603
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell?.

263
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:46,813
You people.

264
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,078
Ifthere isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?.

265
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,114
I am a seraphim.

266
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,789
The highest choir ofangels.

267
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:02,028
You do knowwhat an angel is,
don'tyou?.

268
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,728
Metatron acts as the voice ofGod.

269
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:12,034
Any documented occasion when someyahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

270
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:13,835
they're speaking to me.

271
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,103
Or they're talking to themselves.

272
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,306
Why doesn't God speak for Himself?.

273
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:24,549
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

274
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:27,850
human beings have neither the aural,
nor the psychological capacity...

275
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:32,382
to withstand the awesome power
ofGod's true voice.

276
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,896
Wereyou to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

277
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:38,830
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

278
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:42,734
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?.

279
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:47,138
Aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?.

280
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,878
You want more proof?.

281
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,641
Fine.

282
00:17:53,715 --> 00:17:54,841
How about tequila?.

283
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,092
-Where the hell are we?.
-Only placeyou can go for good tequila.

284
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,254
Dos tequilas, porfavor,
and an empty glass.

285
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:13,028
We're in Mexico?.

286
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,535
Actually, we're in a franchised
Mexican family eatery...

287
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,833
down the street
from your apartment, but...

288
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,770
it's impressive nonetheless.

289
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:24,505
You don't mind I lost the wings, doyou?.
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

290
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,376
What doyou want with me?.

291
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,852
I am to chargeyou
with a holy crusade.

292
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,219
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

293
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,656
Noah was a drunk.
Lookwhat he accomplished.

294
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:42,628
And no one's asking you to build an ark.
All you gotta do is go to NewJersey...

295
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,257
and visit a small church
on a very important day.

296
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:50,999
NewJersey?.

297
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:54,299
That doesn't sound like
much ofa crusade.

298
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,900
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

299
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:59,037
What's the fine print?.

300
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:03,046
Stop a couple of angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

301
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:05,312
Wait, wait, wait.
Repeat that.

302
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:08,651
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

303
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:11,886
and thus negating all existence.

304
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,257
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

305
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,159
You might want to clarify that.

306
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:21,596
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

307
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,796
And His wrath was bore...

308
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,102
by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

309
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:29,336
When Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed...

310
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,900
that was Loki.

311
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:35,039
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

312
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:37,846
that was Loki--
and he was good at what he did.

313
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,682
But one day...

314
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:42,723
he refused to bear God's wrath
any longer.

315
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:46,291
- Why?.
- He listened to his friend...

316
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,419
a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

317
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:49,622
Grigori?.

318
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:52,928
One ofthe choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

319
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,433
Guess what they do.

320
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:58,939
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt--

321
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:01,497
The Tenth Plague.

322
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,374
Tell a person thatyou're the Metatron
and they stare atyou blankly.

323
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:06,538
Mention something out of
a Charlton Heston movie...

324
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,775
and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

325
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,784
May I continue uninterrupted?.

326
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,945
Once he's done with the firstborn...

327
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,719
Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

328
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:20,124
And over many rounds...

329
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:22,321
they get into
this discussion about...

330
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:24,296
whether or not murder
in the name ofGod is okay.

331
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:25,730
And in the end...

332
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,736
Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

333
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:32,136
and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

334
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:33,798
So...

335
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,676
very inebriated...

336
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:40,407
Loki tells God he quits...

337
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:42,779
throws down his fiery sword...

338
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,784
and gives Him the finger.

339
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:48,049
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

340
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,182
God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

341
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:52,726
Hence all the spitting.

342
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,222
So, for their insolence...

343
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,288
God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

344
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:00,926
would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

345
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:02,867
- Were they sent to Hell?.
- Worse.

346
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:04,871
Wisconsin...

347
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:07,874
for the entire span
ofhuman history.

348
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:11,105
And when the world ends, they'll have to
sit outside the gates for all eternity.

349
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:13,169
And this has what to do with me?.

350
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:17,775
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

351
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:20,446
that would allow them
to reenter Heaven.

352
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:23,217
So what?. They beat the system.
Good for them.

353
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,191
It's not that simple.

354
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,355
Ifthey get in,
theywill have reversed God's decree.

355
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,967
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

356
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:39,163
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

357
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,903
function solely on one principle--

358
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:46,003
God is infallible.

359
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,014
To prove Him wrong...

360
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:51,051
would undo reality
and everything that is.

361
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:54,019
Upwould become down,
blackwould becomewhite.

362
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:57,057
Existencewould become nothingness.

363
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:58,716
In essence...

364
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:02,262
ifthey're allowed to enter
that church...

365
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:07,090
they'll unmake the world.

366
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:10,069
Ifthis is so major,
why areyou talking to me?.

367
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:12,901
- Why doesn't God do something about it?.
- He could.

368
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:16,102
But He'd rather seeyou
take care ofthis one personally.

369
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:17,804
Why me?.

370
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,176
Because ofwhoyou are.

371
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,112
And who am I?.

372
00:22:22,183 --> 00:22:24,310
The girl in the pj's!

373
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:28,082
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serveyour purpose.

374
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,180
I'm gonna have to pass.

375
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:32,252
I beg your pardon?.

376
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:36,763
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?.

377
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:38,458
When my husband decided...

378
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:40,966
he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear his children...

379
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:42,332
where was God?.

380
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,034
To Hell with Him.

381
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:50,339
Don't allow eons ofhistory and life
to get blinked out ofbeing...

382
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,709
just becauseyou've got a grudge
againstyour Creator.

383
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,214
Soyou lost the ability
to make life.

384
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:58,774
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

385
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:01,151
by acting like one
and protecting it--

386
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,156
saving it!

387
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,627
But I can't makeyou.

388
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:11,357
However, ifyou should decide
to stop being selfish...

389
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,923
and acceptyour responsibility...

390
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,901
you won't be alone.

391
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,335
You'll have support.

392
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:19,498
What?. More angels?.

393
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,165
Prophets.

394
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,136
In a manner ofspeaking.
Two of'em.

395
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:31,207
The one who speaks...

396
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,846
and he will, at great length,
whetheryou want him to or not...

397
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:36,947
will make mention ofhimself
as a prophet.

398
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:38,514
The other one...

399
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:41,256
well, he's the quiet type.

400
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:42,590
Look, I've gotta go.

401
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:44,995
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

402
00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:50,631
What's He like?.

403
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:51,671
God?.

404
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:55,402
Lonely...

405
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,376
but funny.

406
00:23:57,445 --> 00:23:59,606
He's got a great sense ofhumor.

407
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,614
Take sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

408
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:04,344
than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

409
00:24:04,418 --> 00:24:06,352
Sex is a joke in Heaven?.

410
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,254
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

411
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,586
I'll seeya.

412
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:17,481
Snootch to the motherfucking nootch!

413
00:26:53,621 --> 00:26:57,022
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

414
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,626
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?.

415
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:04,357
I know theywere just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pube-less asses!

416
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:12,638
I don't know what to say
or think, except--

417
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:14,674
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?.

418
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:17,973
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

419
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:20,946
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

420
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:23,540
I don't know who those kids were,
but theywould have kicked yours...

421
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:26,552
and Lunchbox's asses
ifl hadn't represented.

422
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,453
Thanks for being
out here so late.

423
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,718
Wait a minute.
Areyou protestors?.

424
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,784
You mean those dickheads with the signs
and pictures of dead babies?.

425
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,330
Shit no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

426
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:39,366
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

427
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:41,424
But what areyou doing
hanging around?.

428
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:43,527
We're here to pick up chicks.

429
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:45,333
Excuse me?.

430
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:48,569
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

431
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:51,406
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?.

432
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:54,406
Right.

433
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:57,279
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

434
00:27:57,351 --> 00:27:59,251
- I think.
- Wait a second.

435
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,914
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

436
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:03,081
What the shit is that?.

437
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:07,059
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

438
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:10,096
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

439
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:14,923
Now how about that shit?.
Fuck this town, man!

440
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:17,527
I'm goin' back toJersey
and startin' up the business again.

441
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:21,438
I can kick the shit out ofkids
in Red Bank and make myselfa profit.

442
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:24,102
Prophets. Two of'em.

443
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:27,875
- You know what I'm sayin', Silent Bob?.
- You gotta be kidding me.

444
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:30,644
We call this piece ""The Fecalator.""

445
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:33,346
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

446
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,853
Try it on.

447
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:40,223
It's a lot more compact than the flaming
sword, but not nearly as impressive.

448
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:43,593
It doesn't have that
""Wrath ofthe Almighty"" edge to it.

449
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:47,794
How am I supposed to strike fear into
hearts ofthe wicked with this thing?.

450
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:48,960
Look at this.

451
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:53,735
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

452
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:56,799
Easy foryou to say.
You get offlight in a razing.

453
00:28:56,877 --> 00:28:59,072
You got to stand there and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

454
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:01,080
I had to do all the work.

455
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:04,413
What work did you do?.
You lit a few fires.

456
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:07,079
I rained down sulfur.
There's a subtle difference.

457
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:08,883
Okay, I'm sure.

458
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:13,017
Fuckyou. Any moron with a pack
of matches can set a fire.

459
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:15,027
Raining down sulfur
is like an endurance trial.

460
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:17,757
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can engage in...

461
00:29:17,831 --> 00:29:19,389
next to soccer.

462
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:22,599
I'll take this one.

463
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:39,507
So, what's up?. You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or areyou gonna do us both?.

464
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:41,986
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

465
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:44,080
You're a man of principle.

466
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,787
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I askwhat broughtyou here?.

467
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:50,352
Some fuck named John Hughes.

468
00:29:50,431 --> 00:29:52,126
Sixteen Candles John Hughes?.

469
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:56,402
You know that guy too?.
That fuckin' guy.

470
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,234
He made this flick Sixteen Candles.
Not bad.

471
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:01,536
There's tits in it, but no bush.

472
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:04,236
But Ebert over here don't give
a shit about that kind ofthing...

473
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:06,711
because he's like in love
with this John Hughes guy.

474
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,941
He goes out and rents
every one ofhis movies.

475
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:13,476
Fuckin' Breakfast Club, where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

476
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:17,320
Fuckin' WeirdScience, where this babe
wants to undress and get down...

477
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:20,588
but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

478
00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:24,825
And then Prettyin Pink, which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

479
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:28,265
because when the redhead hooks up
with her dream guy...

480
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:31,862
he starts sobbin' like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

481
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:35,170
And there's nothing worse
than watchin' a fuckin' fat man weep.

482
00:30:35,242 --> 00:30:37,210
What exactly broughtyou
to Illinois?.

483
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:41,179
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

484
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:45,378
where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes arewhiny pussies.

485
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:48,421
Except forJudd Nelson.
Hewas fuckin' harsh.

486
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:49,786
But best ofall...

487
00:30:49,857 --> 00:30:51,984
there was no one dealin', man.

488
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,527
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

489
00:30:54,595 --> 00:30:56,893
ifwe were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

490
00:30:56,964 --> 00:31:00,127
Sowe collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

491
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,294
Butyou know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?.

492
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,271
There is no Shermer, Illinois.

493
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,308
Movies are fuckin' bullshit.

494
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:12,368
- When areyou going back to NewJersey?.
- This broad asks a lot of questions.

495
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:15,609
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

496
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,547
Yeah. Soyou do anal?.

497
00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:20,143
Is it true that chicks fart
ifyou blast them in the ass?.

498
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,120
I didn't askyou out for sex.

499
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:24,123
I'll take head.

500
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:30,120
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this.

501
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:34,633
I think I should gowith you.

502
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:37,636
Like steady?.
You wanna be my girlfriend?.

503
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,707
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

504
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,608
No. I wanna go with you
to NewJersey.

505
00:31:44,678 --> 00:31:45,770
Really?.

506
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:47,939
You're going to lead me somewhere.

507
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:49,676
Me lead you?.

508
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,719
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am halfthe time.

509
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,778
Ifwe're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?.

510
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:59,917
Someone told me I'd meetyou and you'd
take me someplace I was supposed to go.

511
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:01,984
What the hell areyou babbling about?.

512
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:04,758
We saved your ass from
some angry fuckin' dwarves...

513
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:08,597
and now we're supposed to takeyou
somewhere as ifwe know where it is?.

514
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,300
Doyou believe in God?.

515
00:32:13,774 --> 00:32:17,039
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front ofthat place...

516
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,044
and we gotta get the oneJesus freak?.

517
00:32:19,112 --> 00:32:20,374
- Let's get the fuck out ofhere.
- Wait.

518
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,142
- I'll scream rape.
- I can payyou.

519
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,516
Pay?.

520
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:29,155
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

521
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:33,318
You were going toJersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

522
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:36,885
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

523
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:39,364
and we're in that fucked-up bar!

524
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:40,957
What about sex?.

525
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:42,365
No sex.

526
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:48,306
Let's saywe're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

527
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,867
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?.

528
00:32:51,945 --> 00:32:53,970
In that highly unlikely situation?.

529
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,545
Yeah, sure.

530
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:01,679
She's a slut.

531
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:05,583
All right.

532
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,161
But I get to drive.

533
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:20,739
What gear areyou in?.

534
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:22,001
Gear?.

535
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:33,545
What do I know about shiftin'?.

536
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:38,818
Like I ever drove before.

537
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,562
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

538
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,031
NewJersey.

539
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,227
Maybeyou're wrong
about this slaughter thing.

540
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:53,432
How can you be sure what incurs the
Lord's wrath these days?. Times change.

541
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:57,238
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a Hell-worthy trespass.

542
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,778
The major sins never change.

543
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:05,947
Besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker from a mile away.

544
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,884
Bet on it.

545
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:10,684
This from the guywho still owes me
ten bucks over that bet...

546
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,954
about which was gonna be the bigger
movie-- ET or Krush Groove.

547
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:17,121
Fuckyou, man,
'cause time's gonna tell on that one.

548
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:24,262
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?.

549
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:25,895
Insinuating, no.

550
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:28,532
Flat-out telling you.

551
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:33,638
Right there.
There's one.

552
00:34:33,714 --> 00:34:36,114
So?. They're kissing.

553
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:37,150
Adultery.

554
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:39,515
- Adultery?.
- Adultery.

555
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:41,554
You are just a simple creature.

556
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,215
- Am I right?.
- I happen to know the truth.

557
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,317
I'm not gonna tell you. I want to see
how boned up on the jobyou are.

558
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:50,192
- What's your proof?.
- He's wearing a wedding band.

559
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:52,959
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?.

560
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:55,331
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

561
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:58,166
Okay. It's a good thing
you were never...

562
00:34:58,238 --> 00:35:01,230
the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

563
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:05,176
"" No married man kisses
his wife like that""?. Areyou stoned?.

564
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:06,337
Excuse me.

565
00:35:09,116 --> 00:35:10,606
Areyou married?.

566
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:12,481
Why?.

567
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:14,019
I'm just curious.

568
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:16,385
What doyou think?.

569
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:27,425
- What?.
- To her?.

570
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,560
- What?.
- Areyou married to her?.

571
00:35:29,636 --> 00:35:33,072
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

572
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,971
Why?.

573
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:21,780
Whose house

574
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:24,323
Run's house

575
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,019
I said, whose house

576
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:29,027
Run's house

577
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:31,222
Whose house
Say what

578
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:33,630
Run's house
Say what

579
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,531
Martin

580
00:36:39,372 --> 00:36:42,432
She's fuckin' pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

581
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,500
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

582
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,773
Let me know how she is.

583
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:49,714
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?.

584
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,814
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

585
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:56,151
but being that I've decided to go home,
and not to NewJersey...

586
00:36:56,223 --> 00:36:58,714
sorry for the inconvenience
and good-bye.

587
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:00,959
You're breaking up with us?.

588
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,628
Who the hell doyou think
you are, lady?.

589
00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:07,690
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

590
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,066
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

591
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:14,265
Guys like us just don't fall out
ofthe fuckin' sky.

592
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:25,914
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out ofthe sky.

593
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,595
No heartbeat.

594
00:37:41,668 --> 00:37:44,262
Think someone threw him out ofa plane
with a message written on him...

595
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:45,861
Iike in ConAir?.

596
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:48,635
- Did you ever see that flick?.
- Oh, did that suck!

597
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,370
- ConAir?. Con Shit.
- Kill it!

598
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:54,538
- Sounds familiar.
-Jesus, areyou okay?.

599
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:56,707
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

600
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:59,047
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!.

601
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,986
What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

602
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:06,151
So ifyou don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yankyour sac offlike a paper towel.

603
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:08,694
Speaking ofwhich,
you're awfully nude.

604
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:11,526
- Rufus, is it?.
- Yes, Rufus it is.

605
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:16,058
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand?.

606
00:38:16,136 --> 00:38:19,435
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find my own threads?.

607
00:38:21,308 --> 00:38:23,572
Dude, he fell out ofthin air.

608
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:28,044
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside ofyour armor.

609
00:38:28,114 --> 00:38:30,446
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

610
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:33,846
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

611
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,388
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

612
00:38:36,456 --> 00:38:39,425
the impact with which you hit
the asphalt would have liquefied you.

613
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:41,255
Death is a worry ofthe living.

614
00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:44,820
The dead, like myself, onlyworry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

615
00:38:44,898 --> 00:38:47,765
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

616
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:48,858
I died.

617
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:51,165
Christ told me the secret
to the resurrection once.

618
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:54,832
We were at this wedding in Caanan.
I got drunk and forgot it.

619
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:56,671
Wait, wait, wait.

620
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:58,643
Christ?.

621
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,805
You knew Christ?.

622
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,939
Knew him?.
Shit, nigga owes me 1 2 bucks.

623
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:04,847
Let me guess.

624
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:07,443
- You're another angel?.
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

625
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,353
I'm a man,just likeyou and him.
Well, maybe not him.

626
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:12,050
At least I was a man.

627
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:15,253
Been dead nearly 2,000 years.
Here, check this out.

628
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,593
Nowonder he sawJesus.
Homey's rockin' the ganj.

629
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,861
It's not a joint.

630
00:39:21,935 --> 00:39:24,233
I can't read this.

631
00:39:24,304 --> 00:39:29,401
It's Aramaic. It says,
"" Rufus, seeyou in twoyears.Jesus.""

632
00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:32,604
Freaked me out because He basically
told me when my numberwas up.

633
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:35,512
Took all the flavor out ofthe
remaining years. We gotta get moving.

634
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:39,245
Let's saywe continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit. Come on.

635
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:41,879
I'm starvin'.
Back off, Kato.

636
00:39:41,955 --> 00:39:43,217
Wait a second!

637
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,016
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out ofthe sky...

638
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,152
and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

639
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:52,221
I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

640
00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:55,734
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where the hell you came from.

641
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,736
Me?. I came from Heaven.

642
00:39:57,804 --> 00:39:59,328
Now let's start walkin'.

643
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:02,239
Walk?. Fuckyou! Doyou know
how farwe are from anywheres?.

644
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:06,540
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

645
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,877
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?.

646
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:15,750
What the hell's an apostle?.

647
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,776
Let me get this straight.

648
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:43,111
She's already met the prophets...

649
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:45,310
and the apostle's with them?.

650
00:40:48,254 --> 00:40:50,518
I think that our best course
of action...

651
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:54,117
is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

652
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:58,790
And being that I can't even
trustyou enough to kill a woman...

653
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:03,061
well, I'm left with no choice...

654
00:41:03,136 --> 00:41:07,197
but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

655
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,703
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

656
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:18,249
I appreciate the loan, brother.
You can have that back.

657
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,685
Man, I rememberwhen all we used to have
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

658
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:24,222
- What doyou call this shit?.
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

659
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,453
Now, how 'boutyou start explaining
some things, like for starters...

660
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,960
how did you know
where to find us?.

661
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,292
Doyou know what the dead do
with most oftheir time?.

662
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,231
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

663
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,927
I can't wait to die.

664
00:41:36,002 --> 00:41:37,833
And why areyou watching me?.

665
00:41:37,904 --> 00:41:40,498
Becauseyou're the one who's gonna
help me get some changes made...

666
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:42,268
in that book
you put so much stock in.

667
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:44,674
- Hustler?.
- The Bible!

668
00:41:44,744 --> 00:41:48,077
- What's your beefwith the Bible?.
- For starters, I'm not in it.

669
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:50,742
Neither are any of us, butyou
don't hear us bitchin' and moanin'.

670
00:41:50,817 --> 00:41:54,275
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 1 3th Apostle.

671
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:59,918
I've gone to church mywhole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 1 3th Apostle.

672
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:02,757
Butyou heard of
the other 1 2 Apostles.

673
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:06,458
Theywere all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

674
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:09,058
And why is that?.
'Cause I'm a black man.

675
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,194
Butyou know what?.
That's just my pet peeve.

676
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:15,731
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing your faith on.

677
00:42:15,808 --> 00:42:19,369
- What's that?.
-Jesus wasn't white.Jesus was black.

678
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:20,605
I don't buy it.

679
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,878
Ifthat's true, why did He get
written about and you were left out?.

680
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:27,181
Well, He is the Son ofGod.

681
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,414
Kind ofhard to have
a New Testament without him.

682
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:32,287
Soyou fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

683
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:35,987
Leaving me out is okay 'causeyou
still got 1 2 white boys to choose from.

684
00:42:36,062 --> 00:42:39,691
- Areyou gonna listen to this shit?.
- That's what people of Antioch said...

685
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,597
right before they stoned my ass.

686
00:42:41,668 --> 00:42:42,828
You were martyred?.

687
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:44,836
That's one way of puttin' it.

688
00:42:44,904 --> 00:42:47,930
Anotherway is to say I was bludgeoned
to shit by big fucking rocks.

689
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:50,805
White folks onlywanna hear
the good shit--

690
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:53,175
Iife eternal,
a place in God's Heaven.

691
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:55,806
But as soon as you hear
thatyou're gettin' this good shit...

692
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:57,577
from a blackJesus, ya freak.

693
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,914
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

694
00:42:59,986 --> 00:43:04,650
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't beyour savior.

695
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:06,055
You gonna eat that hash brown?.

696
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,060
So, you went to Heaven?.

697
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,393
Damn right I went to Heaven!
That's the least He could do.

698
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,901
In the threeyears I followed His ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?.

699
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:19,132
Hell no.
And I was in my prime.

700
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:21,673
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

701
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:24,335
not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

702
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,344
She had a thing for dark meat,
ifyou follow me.

703
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:29,643
Maybe this is just me talking,
but ifl were in Heaven...

704
00:43:29,716 --> 00:43:32,651
I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as they got the message right.

705
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:34,846
The message is what counts.

706
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:38,721
But folks who build theirfaith
on that message should be colorblind.

707
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:41,851
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

708
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:43,862
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

709
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,661
That's why I'm gonna helpyou stop those
angels from gettin' into that church...

710
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:50,328
in exchange foryou helping me
with my campaign.

711
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:53,167
How doyou know about that,
the angels?.

712
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,367
- Isn't much I don't know aboutyou.
- I find that hard to believe.

713
00:43:56,442 --> 00:44:00,742
When you were five, you let a kid
from next door piss on your hand.

714
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:04,214
You did that shit?.
You're nasty.

715
00:44:04,284 --> 00:44:06,809
I never told anybody about that.

716
00:44:06,886 --> 00:44:08,581
Neither did he.

717
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:11,488
Two years later,
that kid died ofleukemia.

718
00:44:11,557 --> 00:44:14,253
His name was Brian Johnson.

719
00:44:14,327 --> 00:44:16,454
Your exploits,
no matter how inane...

720
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,588
are well documented in Heaven.

721
00:44:18,665 --> 00:44:20,496
Probably Hell too.

722
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,332
Where areyou going?.

723
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:29,238
Tell me somethin' about me.

724
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:32,301
You masturbate more than anyone
on the planet.

725
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,245
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

726
00:44:35,315 --> 00:44:37,783
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

727
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,055
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry ifl scared you.

728
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,096
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

729
00:44:51,164 --> 00:44:53,792
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
God even existed.

730
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:57,358
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

731
00:44:57,437 --> 00:45:01,305
Let me letyou in
on a little inside info.

732
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:06,107
God hates it when
it's referred to as ""mythology.""

733
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,776
Oh, well, then let's ask the ""prophets""
what we should call it instead.

734
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:17,548
Where did those two assholes go?.

735
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:37,133
What areyou doing?.

736
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,235
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

737
00:45:39,312 --> 00:45:41,303
- What?.
- Long story. Forget it.

738
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:43,713
We gotta get movin'.
How can we get toJersey?.

739
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,808
We'll take the train.
I'll call for reservations.

740
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:45,611
I thought she looked familiar.

741
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,305
- Who?.
- Serendipity.

742
00:47:00,626 --> 00:47:01,718
Morning, shoppers.

743
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:03,557
Good morning.

744
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:06,898
- Has anyone seen the overnights?.
- No, sir.

745
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:09,826
We creamed 'em.

746
00:47:12,505 --> 00:47:15,167
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me--

747
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,644
Do I smell onions?.

748
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:27,450
Excuse me.

749
00:47:30,857 --> 00:47:33,348
May I askwhatyou're doing
in my boardroom?.

750
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:37,228
You may proceed, mon ami.

751
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,861
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

752
00:47:42,935 --> 00:47:45,870
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

753
00:47:45,938 --> 00:47:47,530
Oh, come on!

754
00:47:50,843 --> 00:47:52,777
Relax. I'm doing it.

755
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,071
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

756
00:47:57,149 --> 00:48:01,552
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher in 1 989.

757
00:48:01,621 --> 00:48:04,385
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1 991.

758
00:48:04,457 --> 00:48:08,223
Broadcast nationally
as the "" Mooby Fun-Time Hour.""

759
00:48:08,294 --> 00:48:12,788
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

760
00:48:12,865 --> 00:48:16,858
1 6 records,
8 prime-time specials...

761
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:21,532
and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

762
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,566
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

763
00:48:25,645 --> 00:48:28,205
dubbed "" MoobyWorld.""

764
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,613
Did I miss anything?.

765
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:32,446
You forgot Mooby Magazine.

766
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:33,951
Damn it!

767
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,749
Is there a point to this?.

768
00:48:35,821 --> 00:48:39,587
You and your board are idolaters.

769
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,494
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

770
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,190
That's you.

771
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:51,630
Do you know much about voodoo?.

772
00:48:53,105 --> 00:48:56,404
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine offaith to speak of.

773
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,205
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

774
00:48:59,278 --> 00:49:01,269
the most well-known ofwhich...

775
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:02,871
is the voodoo doll.

776
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:04,416
You see...

777
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:15,784
a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

778
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:17,988
to various pokes and prods.

779
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:22,194
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

780
00:49:22,268 --> 00:49:23,826
Call security, now!

781
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:31,241
All lines are currently down.

782
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:33,710
- I'm gonna have to apologize--
- Would you knock it off?.

783
00:49:33,779 --> 00:49:36,247
You're doing it again.
Stop. What did we talk about?.

784
00:49:37,383 --> 00:49:40,750
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

785
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,788
which draws worship
from the Lord.

786
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:45,153
You have broken
the First Commandment.

787
00:49:45,224 --> 00:49:48,216
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one ofyou...

788
00:49:48,294 --> 00:49:51,058
passes for a decent human being.

789
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:55,567
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

790
00:49:55,635 --> 00:49:57,569
Likeyou, Mr. Burton.

791
00:49:57,637 --> 00:50:01,129
Lastyear, you cheated on yourwife
of 1 7 years 8 times.

792
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,437
You even had sex
with her best friend...

793
00:50:03,509 --> 00:50:07,843
whileyou were supposed to be home
watching the kids.

794
00:50:07,913 --> 00:50:11,405
In the bed thatyou
and yourwife share, no less.

795
00:50:11,484 --> 00:50:12,610
Mr. Newman.

796
00:50:12,685 --> 00:50:15,415
You gotyour girlfriend drunk
at lastyear's Christmas party...

797
00:50:15,488 --> 00:50:17,786
and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

798
00:50:17,857 --> 00:50:20,382
to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

799
00:50:20,459 --> 00:50:23,087
just soyou could break up
with her guilt-free...

800
00:50:23,162 --> 00:50:25,528
when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

801
00:50:26,966 --> 00:50:29,799
She killed herself
three months later.

802
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:32,804
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

803
00:50:32,872 --> 00:50:34,806
Very compassionate.

804
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:37,968
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

805
00:50:38,044 --> 00:50:41,377
and used the profits
from the sale ofher home...

806
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:45,281
to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

807
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:47,046
Heavens.

808
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,883
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

809
00:50:49,955 --> 00:50:53,618
to have sex
with an eleven-year-old boy.

810
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:56,753
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

811
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:59,593
from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

812
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:02,065
because it was-- survey says--

813
00:51:03,536 --> 00:51:05,401
Iess costly.

814
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:08,463
You, on the other hand...

815
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:10,805
are an innocent.

816
00:51:10,876 --> 00:51:12,741
You lead a good life.

817
00:51:12,812 --> 00:51:13,904
Good foryou.

818
00:51:14,814 --> 00:51:17,874
But you, Mr. Whitland...

819
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,918
you have more skeletons
in your closet...

820
00:51:19,985 --> 00:51:21,919
than this assembled party.

821
00:51:21,987 --> 00:51:24,683
I cannot even mention them aloud.

822
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:32,156
You're his father,
you sick fuck!

823
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:36,826
- Good.
- Not bad, man.

824
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:38,836
That's great work.
Very good.

825
00:51:40,106 --> 00:51:41,698
Well...

826
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,036
alone at last.

827
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:47,636
With the exception of Miss Pryce here...

828
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:51,513
there isn't a decent human being
amongstyou.

829
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:53,347
Not one.

830
00:51:53,419 --> 00:51:57,014
Doyou know what makes
a human being decent?.

831
00:51:57,089 --> 00:51:58,351
Fear.

832
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:00,517
And therein lies the problem.

833
00:52:00,593 --> 00:52:03,528
None ofyou has anything
left to fear anymore.

834
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:07,054
You rest comfortably in seats
ofinscrutable power...

835
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:10,364
hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

836
00:52:10,436 --> 00:52:13,701
Iives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

837
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:17,375
But not from God.

838
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:24,474
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

839
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:30,214
Man, it really looks
just likeyou, doesn't it?.

840
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:34,055
Look, ifl believed enough in this...

841
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:35,718
I wonder--

842
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:55,242
Come on.
I don't believe in voodoo.

843
00:52:59,952 --> 00:53:01,544
Voodoo.

844
00:53:08,928 --> 00:53:11,522
But I do believe in this.

845
00:53:11,597 --> 00:53:13,997
Don't run! Don't run!

846
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:16,864
Fakes! Fakes!
All ofyou, fakes!

847
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:21,602
"" But I do believe in this.""

848
00:53:21,674 --> 00:53:23,107
What does that mean?.

849
00:53:23,175 --> 00:53:24,642
And one to grow on.

850
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:31,808
Gum?.

851
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:35,746
Go on. It's okay.

852
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:37,880
You've done nothing wrong.

853
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:41,051
These guys were fakes.

854
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:43,458
You're a pure soul.

855
00:53:45,064 --> 00:53:47,658
Butyou didn't say ""God bless you""
when I sneezed.

856
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:50,167
Loki!

857
00:53:52,238 --> 00:53:53,671
You're getting offlight.

858
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:55,764
- Loki!
- I know. I'm comin'.

859
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,211
You're so lucky.

860
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:08,451
I forgotyou were down here.
How long now?.

861
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,953
Threeyears this August.

862
00:54:10,022 --> 00:54:13,685
Let me guess-- the 1 4th Apostle, left
out ofthe Bible because she's a woman?.

863
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,987
This girl's no woman.

864
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,086
Oh. Those weren't tits
I sawJay cozying up to?.

865
00:54:18,163 --> 00:54:19,892
What, these?.

866
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:24,163
You should know better than anyone here
that tits don't make a woman.

867
00:54:24,236 --> 00:54:26,636
Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

868
00:54:26,705 --> 00:54:30,232
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things--

869
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,004
her legs.

870
00:54:32,077 --> 00:54:34,511
But as you can see...

871
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,343
I lack definition.

872
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:40,146
Hey, they're gettin' a free show!
Let me see that shit!

873
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:43,245
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

874
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,984
How doyou--
How does she know Metatron?.

875
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:48,049
This is the last scion.

876
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:51,725
You're kidding.

877
00:54:51,797 --> 00:54:53,458
Wow.

878
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:54,556
I'm confused.

879
00:54:54,633 --> 00:54:58,729
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

880
00:54:58,804 --> 00:55:02,501
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

881
00:55:02,574 --> 00:55:06,340
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

882
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:07,970
I'm a muse, stupid.

883
00:55:09,048 --> 00:55:11,642
I can't take much more ofthis.

884
00:55:11,717 --> 00:55:13,412
Soyou, what, inspire people?.

885
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:16,215
What just went down
with your friends over there--

886
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:19,189
It doesn't really take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty theirwallets.

887
00:55:19,258 --> 00:55:21,249
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

888
00:55:21,327 --> 00:55:26,822
For example, I'm responsible for 1 9 of
the 20 top-grossing films ofall time.

889
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:29,493
- Nineteen?.
- Yeah.

890
00:55:29,568 --> 00:55:32,503
The one about the kid
by himselfin his house...

891
00:55:32,571 --> 00:55:35,597
burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off--

892
00:55:35,674 --> 00:55:37,938
I had nothing to do
with that one.

893
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:42,344
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.

894
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:03,066
What areyou doing stripping?.

895
00:56:03,135 --> 00:56:04,568
Rememberwhy I left?.

896
00:56:04,636 --> 00:56:08,072
Becauseyou were tired of getting
none ofthe credit foryour ideas.

897
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,303
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

898
00:56:11,377 --> 00:56:15,279
I gave my two weeks notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

899
00:56:15,347 --> 00:56:18,407
and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

900
00:56:18,484 --> 00:56:20,042
So what happened?.

901
00:56:21,286 --> 00:56:22,878
Writer's block.

902
00:56:22,955 --> 00:56:25,822
Can you believe it?.
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

903
00:56:25,891 --> 00:56:29,918
I can inspire anyone I meet and give out
a zillion and nine ideas a second...

904
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:31,929
but I can't keep any for myself.

905
00:56:33,532 --> 00:56:35,932
Her quirky sense ofhumor.

906
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:38,265
- Whose?.
- God's.

907
00:56:38,337 --> 00:56:41,272
- You're saying God's a woman?.
- Was there ever a doubt in your mind?.

908
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,137
He's always referred to as "" Him.""

909
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,039
That's not how I wrote it.

910
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,044
But one ofthe drawbacks
to being intangible...

911
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,842
is thatyou have no say
in the editorial process.

912
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:52,975
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

913
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:55,577
and all the penholders were men.

914
00:56:55,654 --> 00:56:59,590
So She became a He.
Doesn't stop with God either.

915
00:56:59,658 --> 00:57:01,717
The whole book's gender-biased.

916
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:04,024
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

917
00:57:04,096 --> 00:57:06,291
A woman cuts Samson coif of power.

918
00:57:06,365 --> 00:57:09,766
A woman asks for the head
ofJohn the Baptist.

919
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:11,302
Read that book again.

920
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,498
Women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the Egyptians and Romans combined.

921
00:57:14,573 --> 00:57:15,835
It stinks.

922
00:57:22,214 --> 00:57:23,977
Why is the last scion here?.

923
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,018
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

924
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:30,283
- Not the plenary indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?.

925
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:33,290
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

926
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:35,292
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

927
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,885
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?.

928
00:57:37,963 --> 00:57:41,524
I have issues with anyone who treats God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

929
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,965
Iike some Catholics.

930
00:57:43,035 --> 00:57:46,004
You people don't celebrateyour faith,
you mourn it.

931
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:50,303
-Ifwe're wrong, what religion is right?.
-It's not about who's right orwrong.

932
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,309
No denomination's nailed ityet...

933
00:57:52,377 --> 00:57:55,005
because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

934
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:00,017
that it doesn't matterwhatyou have
faith in,just thatyou have faith.

935
00:58:00,085 --> 00:58:04,522
Your hearts are in the right place,
butyour brains gotta wake up.

936
00:58:06,925 --> 00:58:09,485
They made me and Silent Bob
part ofthe gang.

937
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,334
Who fuckin' farted?.

938
00:58:18,837 --> 00:58:22,068
Not born.
Shit into existence.

939
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:28,344
Sweet Christ,
somebodywants you bad!

940
00:58:28,413 --> 00:58:30,904
- What is that thing?.
- An excremental.

941
00:58:30,983 --> 00:58:33,247
- The Golgothan.
- A what?.

942
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:34,717
A shit demon!

943
00:58:34,786 --> 00:58:38,449
No man ofwoman born!

944
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,387
- Friend ofyours?.
- Is this smelly fuckwith us?.

945
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:44,088
It came for Bethany!

946
00:58:44,163 --> 00:58:47,098
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thang!

947
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,634
I knew I's gonna
whack somebody today!

948
00:58:49,701 --> 00:58:51,635
Getyour fuckin' hand back.

949
00:58:51,703 --> 00:58:52,931
Represent!

950
00:58:54,306 --> 00:58:56,740
Go! Go! Go!

951
00:59:18,063 --> 00:59:20,497
Looks like we're in charge
ofthe gang now.

952
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:23,391
Over the bar!

953
00:59:32,878 --> 00:59:36,314
- Where did that thing come from?.
- Ever heard ofGolgotha?.

954
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:38,406
The hill where Christ
was crucified.

955
00:59:38,483 --> 00:59:41,247
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

956
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,847
Christ excluded, theywere criminals--
killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

957
00:59:44,923 --> 00:59:48,051
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

958
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,651
spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

959
00:59:50,729 --> 00:59:53,596
the result ofwhich
is that walking pile of crap--

960
00:59:53,665 --> 00:59:56,759
the Golgothan shit demon,
Hell's chiefassassin.

961
00:59:56,835 --> 00:59:58,632
It's here foryou, girlie.

962
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:05,438
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

963
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,574
- Hey, man.
- How?.

964
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,342
"" Knocks strong odors out.""

965
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:47,351
- Way to go, biggie.
- Whywould you ever carry this?.

966
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:51,149
What?.

967
01:00:51,223 --> 01:00:53,157
Whoever sent this might send more.

968
01:00:53,225 --> 01:00:57,184
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

969
01:00:57,262 --> 01:00:59,822
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

970
01:00:59,898 --> 01:01:02,662
Ifhe tells me something,
I'll letyou know.

971
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:06,267
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to NewJersey, please.

972
01:01:06,338 --> 01:01:08,033
Jersey's sold out, sir.

973
01:01:08,106 --> 01:01:10,700
- What?.
- There's one at the same time tomorrow.

974
01:01:10,776 --> 01:01:14,712
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power ofthe Garden State.

975
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,112
Show up two hours in advance.

976
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,817
Nice.

977
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:23,821
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

978
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:28,019
what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

979
01:01:28,093 --> 01:01:29,754
Bus, schmuss.

980
01:01:29,828 --> 01:01:34,424
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?.

981
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:36,933
- You mean fly?.
- We got wings, right?.

982
01:01:37,002 --> 01:01:38,594
Fuck, let's use 'em!

983
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:41,104
I wouldn't suggest that.

984
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:44,338
You see, kids...

985
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,845
you wouldn't want to look like
a couple offairies, now, would you?.

986
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:55,578
How'd you get out of Hell?.

987
01:01:55,654 --> 01:01:57,918
I told them I was coming up
on a routine possession.

988
01:01:57,989 --> 01:02:01,220
I don't have much time. Ifthey figure
out my ruse, they'll come after me.

989
01:02:01,293 --> 01:02:05,024
-What's with bringing us in here?.
-You two are inches from getting caught.

990
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:08,589
Going around killing people,
about to uncaseyourwings.

991
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:10,601
Don'tyou know what's going on?.

992
01:02:10,669 --> 01:02:12,603
Well, we're going home.

993
01:02:12,671 --> 01:02:17,131
Really. Areyou so clueless as to think
you can justwaltz back into Heaven?.

994
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:19,769
- Why not?.
- Everybody is looking foryou.

995
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:22,780
Both sides.
Above and below.

996
01:02:22,848 --> 01:02:25,146
Orders are to terminateyou
on sight.

997
01:02:25,217 --> 01:02:26,616
- Really?.
- Why?.

998
01:02:26,685 --> 01:02:28,846
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

999
01:02:30,188 --> 01:02:32,850
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1000
01:02:32,924 --> 01:02:36,189
and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you assholes might make him look bad...

1001
01:02:36,261 --> 01:02:38,195
by succeeding
where he's failed so many times.

1002
01:02:38,263 --> 01:02:41,357
- So they're just gonna kill us?.
- They're gonna try.

1003
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:44,368
That's whyyou have to travel
incognito.

1004
01:02:44,436 --> 01:02:47,496
Tone down your behavior.
Stay offtheir respective radars.

1005
01:02:47,572 --> 01:02:49,506
Quit killing people.
That's high profile.

1006
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:52,475
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe theywanna kill us.

1007
01:02:52,544 --> 01:02:54,478
Oh, believe it, boys.

1008
01:02:55,714 --> 01:02:57,978
They've even got the last scion
looking foryou.

1009
01:02:58,049 --> 01:02:59,812
- Really?.
- You're kidding.

1010
01:02:59,885 --> 01:03:02,877
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot ofsides.

1011
01:03:02,954 --> 01:03:04,888
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1012
01:03:04,956 --> 01:03:08,221
In the meantime, I suggestyou find
an alternate mode oftransportation.

1013
01:03:08,293 --> 01:03:10,352
Ifanything else comes up,
I'll contactyou.

1014
01:03:10,429 --> 01:03:13,626
Thankyou, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1015
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:16,633
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1016
01:03:16,701 --> 01:03:20,364
And remember, incognito.

1017
01:03:24,776 --> 01:03:27,404
Howyou coping, kid?.

1018
01:03:27,479 --> 01:03:29,174
It's weird.

1019
01:03:29,247 --> 01:03:31,841
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1020
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:35,182
something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1021
01:03:35,253 --> 01:03:37,813
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1022
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:40,551
You sound like the Man.

1023
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,024
What's he like?.

1024
01:03:42,093 --> 01:03:44,653
He likes to listen to people talk.

1025
01:03:44,729 --> 01:03:48,165
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1026
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:50,599
Wheneverwe were going on
about unimportant shit...

1027
01:03:50,669 --> 01:03:52,864
he always had a smile
on his face.

1028
01:03:52,938 --> 01:03:54,997
His only real beefwith mankind...

1029
01:03:55,073 --> 01:03:58,338
is the shit that gets carried out
in His name.

1030
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,811
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1031
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,543
The big one, though,
is the factioning ofall the religions.

1032
01:04:05,617 --> 01:04:07,551
He said mankind
got it all wrong...

1033
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:11,111
bytaking a good idea
and building a beliefstructure on it.

1034
01:04:11,189 --> 01:04:13,851
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?.

1035
01:04:13,925 --> 01:04:16,018
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1036
01:04:16,094 --> 01:04:19,222
You can change an idea.
Changing a beliefis trickier.

1037
01:04:19,297 --> 01:04:21,788
People die for it.
People kill for it.

1038
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:24,301
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1039
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:29,534
because ofthe Catholic beliefstructure
regarding this plenary indulgence shit.

1040
01:04:29,608 --> 01:04:31,872
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1041
01:04:31,943 --> 01:04:33,877
are exploiting that belief...

1042
01:04:33,945 --> 01:04:35,412
and ifthey're successful...

1043
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,678
you, me, all ofthis
ends in a heartbeat.

1044
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,742
All over a belief.

1045
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:47,948
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How aboutyou?.

1046
01:04:48,026 --> 01:04:51,120
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1047
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:54,529
and he went flying through the air,
fuckin' crashed through thewall.

1048
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,032
Itwas fucked up.

1049
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:59,036
You two aren't getting into
anytrouble, areyou?.

1050
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:02,369
We'rejust about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1051
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,671
who just got on at the last stop--
Larry and Barry.

1052
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:09,839
So,Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1053
01:05:14,553 --> 01:05:16,987
Hit this shit, man.
It's good stuff.

1054
01:05:18,356 --> 01:05:19,789
Oh, fuck.

1055
01:05:23,361 --> 01:05:25,795
That's some bad shit, dude.

1056
01:05:25,864 --> 01:05:27,798
You hit that?.

1057
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:32,135
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1058
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,807
Bad shit.

1059
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:40,300
Why areyou
heading to NewJersey?.

1060
01:05:40,378 --> 01:05:43,814
It's just this thing I have to do.

1061
01:05:43,882 --> 01:05:45,372
We're going home.

1062
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:48,214
Oh.
Doyou two live together?.

1063
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:50,151
Unfortunately, yes.

1064
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:55,555
So, how long haveyou two
been together?.

1065
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,659
A while.

1066
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:02,461
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1067
01:06:02,534 --> 01:06:04,126
How'd you meet?.

1068
01:06:04,202 --> 01:06:05,794
We were stationed together.

1069
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:08,236
See, that's beautiful.

1070
01:06:08,306 --> 01:06:12,174
Everybody's always up in arms
about this ""out in the military"" issue.

1071
01:06:13,278 --> 01:06:14,370
Pardon?.

1072
01:06:14,446 --> 01:06:18,746
You know, there's all the macho bullshit
about it being ""this man's army.""

1073
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:21,081
You two meet there, hook up--

1074
01:06:22,053 --> 01:06:25,216
You thinkwe're lovers?.
No, no. We're not gay.

1075
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:27,724
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:30,920
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?.

1077
01:06:33,732 --> 01:06:36,929
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1078
01:06:37,002 --> 01:06:39,562
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1079
01:06:39,638 --> 01:06:41,230
I call it being dumped.

1080
01:06:41,306 --> 01:06:43,297
I was...

1081
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,036
dumped once.

1082
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:48,045
Don'tyou just constantly
question yourvalue?.

1083
01:06:48,113 --> 01:06:50,741
Like, whywas I so easy
to cast aside?.

1084
01:06:50,815 --> 01:06:54,410
And you wonder ifthe other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1085
01:06:54,486 --> 01:06:55,919
and call you back.

1086
01:06:55,987 --> 01:06:59,445
They always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1087
01:06:59,524 --> 01:07:01,617
When actually...

1088
01:07:01,693 --> 01:07:03,388
it hurts more.

1089
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:09,028
You know what we need?.

1090
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,931
What do we need?.

1091
01:07:11,002 --> 01:07:12,526
We need drinks.

1092
01:07:14,172 --> 01:07:16,072
We need a lot of drinks.

1093
01:07:17,676 --> 01:07:19,610
Garcon.

1094
01:07:26,017 --> 01:07:28,042
You still go to church?.

1095
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:30,280
Every Sunday.

1096
01:07:30,355 --> 01:07:32,755
Does it do anything foryou?.

1097
01:07:32,824 --> 01:07:35,987
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook everyweek.

1098
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:40,122
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1099
01:07:40,198 --> 01:07:42,462
They go to church and feel bored...

1100
01:07:42,534 --> 01:07:45,935
but they keep going everyweek
just out ofhabit.

1101
01:07:46,004 --> 01:07:48,302
I am so buzzed.

1102
01:07:49,908 --> 01:07:52,843
When doyou think
you lostyour faith?.

1103
01:07:52,911 --> 01:07:55,141
I remember the exact moment.

1104
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:01,513
I was on the phone with my mother...

1105
01:08:01,586 --> 01:08:05,545
and she was trying to counsel me
through this--

1106
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,124
this thing.

1107
01:08:10,228 --> 01:08:14,665
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1108
01:08:14,733 --> 01:08:16,667
she said...

1109
01:08:16,735 --> 01:08:18,635
"" Bethany...

1110
01:08:18,703 --> 01:08:20,637
God has a plan."

1111
01:08:24,042 --> 01:08:27,739
I was-- I was so angrywith her.

1112
01:08:29,848 --> 01:08:31,440
I was like...

1113
01:08:31,516 --> 01:08:33,450
""What about my plans??"

1114
01:08:33,518 --> 01:08:35,383
- You know?.
- Mm-hmm.

1115
01:08:35,453 --> 01:08:38,479
I had planned
to have a family...

1116
01:08:38,556 --> 01:08:40,217
with my husband.

1117
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:43,226
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?.

1118
01:08:47,132 --> 01:08:49,066
Apparently not.

1119
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:56,363
How aboutyou?.
How'd you loseyour faith?.

1120
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:59,772
A long time ago.

1121
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:03,336
One day God just stopped listening.

1122
01:09:03,414 --> 01:09:07,976
I kept talking, but I got the distinct
impression He wasn't listening anymore.

1123
01:09:08,052 --> 01:09:11,544
How did you know She was listening
in the first place?.

1124
01:09:14,392 --> 01:09:16,326
Well, I guess I don't.

1125
01:09:16,394 --> 01:09:18,624
I hate thoughts like that.

1126
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:22,824
But, you know,
they come toyou with age.

1127
01:09:22,901 --> 01:09:27,270
'Cause when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1128
01:09:28,807 --> 01:09:31,571
God's in Heaven, and He's--

1129
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:35,079
She's always got her eye on you.

1130
01:09:39,584 --> 01:09:42,519
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1131
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:50,856
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1132
01:09:59,037 --> 01:10:01,267
Where is this pilgrimage to?.

1133
01:10:01,339 --> 01:10:04,536
- You wouldn't believe me ifl told you.
- Try me.

1134
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:06,941
All right, but I warned you.

1135
01:10:07,011 --> 01:10:08,706
Okay.

1136
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:12,375
I'm going to this church
in NewJersey.

1137
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:14,247
Really.

1138
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:18,756
Kerwood Mandel to car three.
Kerwood Mandel to car three.

1139
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:22,281
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1140
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,294
from going into the church.

1141
01:10:26,197 --> 01:10:28,062
They're trying--

1142
01:10:28,132 --> 01:10:29,565
Shit.

1143
01:10:31,369 --> 01:10:33,803
They're trying
to get back into Heaven.

1144
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:39,769
See, they got tossed
out of Heaven...

1145
01:10:39,844 --> 01:10:41,311
years ago, right?.

1146
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,575
And ifthey get back in...

1147
01:10:44,649 --> 01:10:46,514
it proves God wrong...

1148
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:49,747
and since God is infallible...

1149
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:51,584
to prove Herwrong...

1150
01:10:51,656 --> 01:10:54,921
would, you know, unmake existence.

1151
01:10:56,694 --> 01:10:58,821
May I haveyourattention, please.

1152
01:10:58,897 --> 01:11:03,163
The dining car will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

1153
01:11:03,234 --> 01:11:05,862
I feel so stupid...

1154
01:11:05,937 --> 01:11:07,871
just saying it.

1155
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,672
The thing I don't get is...

1156
01:11:11,743 --> 01:11:14,439
how am I supposed to stop
an angel?.

1157
01:11:14,512 --> 01:11:15,945
Two, even!

1158
01:11:21,085 --> 01:11:24,452
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1159
01:11:24,522 --> 01:11:26,649
Maybeyou're supposed to kill them.

1160
01:11:26,724 --> 01:11:29,921
Oh, yeah, right.
Kill them.

1161
01:11:31,262 --> 01:11:35,756
I mean, even ifthat were the case,
which it's not...

1162
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:40,027
how doyou kill an angel, Barry?.

1163
01:11:40,805 --> 01:11:42,830
Oh...

1164
01:11:42,907 --> 01:11:44,807
I don't suppose
it's much different from...

1165
01:11:45,877 --> 01:11:47,310
killing a human.

1166
01:11:48,746 --> 01:11:51,340
Where is everybody?.
I wake up and--

1167
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:55,218
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1168
01:11:55,286 --> 01:11:58,312
Rufus, I wantyou to meet
my new friend Barry.

1169
01:12:01,659 --> 01:12:03,650
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1170
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:06,492
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1171
01:12:06,564 --> 01:12:08,828
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?.

1172
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,495
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?.

1173
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:15,471
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1174
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,441
Save it. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1175
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:19,441
Loki!

1176
01:12:20,511 --> 01:12:21,773
Holy shit. The apostle.

1177
01:12:21,846 --> 01:12:23,939
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1178
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:26,006
What areyou doing here?.

1179
01:12:26,084 --> 01:12:28,018
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1180
01:12:28,086 --> 01:12:30,020
- Us?.
- No, two other fucking angels.

1181
01:12:30,088 --> 01:12:33,751
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?.

1182
01:12:33,825 --> 01:12:36,623
You haven't thought about
the consequences ofyour reentry.

1183
01:12:36,694 --> 01:12:38,389
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1184
01:12:38,463 --> 01:12:41,398
We're going home,
no matterwhose pride it may hurt.

1185
01:12:41,466 --> 01:12:43,957
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1186
01:12:44,035 --> 01:12:46,731
What areyou, high?. I can't kill her
ifshe hasn't done anything.

1187
01:12:46,804 --> 01:12:48,237
Fine.
I'll kill her myself.

1188
01:12:48,306 --> 01:12:50,638
I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?.

1189
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:53,268
- These guys are fuckin' flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1190
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:04,913
Oh, shit!

1191
01:13:06,357 --> 01:13:07,824
Jay!

1192
01:13:08,993 --> 01:13:10,221
Biggie!

1193
01:13:10,294 --> 01:13:12,762
The door! The door!

1194
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:18,831
Can't we talk about this?.

1195
01:13:24,308 --> 01:13:27,300
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1196
01:14:07,285 --> 01:14:08,718
No ticket.

1197
01:14:12,023 --> 01:14:14,719
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1198
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:18,284
- Then you know who she was, don't you?.
- The scion, I imagine!

1199
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,188
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1200
01:14:21,265 --> 01:14:24,462
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1201
01:14:24,535 --> 01:14:28,494
And Azrael tells us we're marked?.
There's more to this than we thought of.

1202
01:14:28,573 --> 01:14:30,598
I was close.

1203
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:33,838
You know?. I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1204
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:35,003
Whoa.

1205
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:38,344
You know how I felt?.
Righteous.

1206
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:40,008
Justified.
Eager, even.

1207
01:14:40,084 --> 01:14:42,143
You all right?.
Your eyes are kinda--

1208
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,347
My eyes are open.

1209
01:14:44,422 --> 01:14:46,356
For the first time I get it.

1210
01:14:46,424 --> 01:14:50,224
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1211
01:14:50,294 --> 01:14:54,060
See, in the beginning it was
just us and Him-- angels and God.

1212
01:14:54,132 --> 01:14:55,895
Then He created humans.

1213
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:58,993
Ours was designed to be
a life ofservitude and worship...

1214
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:02,335
and bowing and scraping and adoration.

1215
01:15:02,406 --> 01:15:06,843
He gave them more than He ever gave us.
He gave them a choice.

1216
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:10,210
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore Him.

1217
01:15:10,281 --> 01:15:12,215
All this time
we've been down here...

1218
01:15:12,283 --> 01:15:14,877
I've felt the absence
ofthe Divine Presence...

1219
01:15:14,952 --> 01:15:18,251
and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1220
01:15:18,322 --> 01:15:22,281
And why?.
Because ofthe way He made us.

1221
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,693
Had we been given free will we could
choose to ignore the pain, like they do.

1222
01:15:25,763 --> 01:15:27,560
But no, we're servants.

1223
01:15:27,632 --> 01:15:29,657
Okay.

1224
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:33,261
All I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1225
01:15:33,337 --> 01:15:37,239
Wake up! These humans have besmirched
everything He's bestowed upon them.

1226
01:15:37,308 --> 01:15:39,242
Theywere given paradise;,
they threw it away.

1227
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,744
Theywere given this planet;
they destroyed it.

1228
01:15:41,812 --> 01:15:44,372
Theywere favored best
among all His endeavors...

1229
01:15:44,448 --> 01:15:47,781
and some ofthem
don't even believe He exists!

1230
01:15:47,852 --> 01:15:49,945
And in spite ofit all...

1231
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:53,752
He has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1232
01:15:53,824 --> 01:15:55,621
at every turn.

1233
01:15:55,693 --> 01:15:57,217
What about us?.

1234
01:15:58,396 --> 01:16:01,331
I asked you once...

1235
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:04,334
to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1236
01:16:04,402 --> 01:16:06,233
What was the result?.

1237
01:16:06,304 --> 01:16:08,568
Our expulsion from paradise.

1238
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:11,233
Where was His
infinite fucking patience then?.

1239
01:16:11,309 --> 01:16:14,142
It's not right!
It's not fair!

1240
01:16:14,212 --> 01:16:16,146
We've paid our debt!

1241
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:20,379
Don'tyou think it's time?.

1242
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:23,318
Don'tyou think it's time
we went home?.

1243
01:16:25,022 --> 01:16:29,982
And to do that, I thinkwe may have to
dispatch ourwould-be dispatchers.

1244
01:16:30,061 --> 01:16:32,757
Wait. Wait, wait.
Kill them?.

1245
01:16:33,864 --> 01:16:36,594
You're talking about the last scion,
for Christ's sake.

1246
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:39,602
And what aboutJay and Bob?.
Those guys were all right.

1247
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,228
Don't.
Don't, my friend.

1248
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,934
Don't letyour sympathies
get the best ofyou.

1249
01:16:45,009 --> 01:16:46,499
They did me once.

1250
01:16:46,577 --> 01:16:48,477
Scion or not...

1251
01:16:48,546 --> 01:16:49,979
she's just a human...

1252
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:53,210
and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1253
01:16:53,284 --> 01:16:55,275
No harm, no foul.

1254
01:16:56,454 --> 01:16:59,389
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1255
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:02,290
What did you say?.

1256
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,454
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don'tyou do that to me.

1257
01:17:05,529 --> 01:17:08,555
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shutyour fucking face!

1258
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:11,727
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1259
01:17:11,802 --> 01:17:14,396
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1260
01:17:14,472 --> 01:17:17,032
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1261
01:17:18,442 --> 01:17:20,034
Well, fuck that.

1262
01:17:20,111 --> 01:17:24,480
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the Throne.

1263
01:17:25,483 --> 01:17:27,576
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1264
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:30,849
We're going home, Loki...

1265
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:34,982
and no one, notyou,
not even the Almighty Himself...

1266
01:17:35,059 --> 01:17:36,993
is gonna make that otherwise.

1267
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:44,934
Shit.

1268
01:17:46,137 --> 01:17:49,766
Why couldn't we stay on the train?.
You threw those guys off.

1269
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,569
Very basic strategy.

1270
01:17:51,642 --> 01:17:55,078
Ifyour enemies know whereyou are,
then don't be there.

1271
01:17:55,146 --> 01:17:56,272
Why are we enemies?.

1272
01:17:56,347 --> 01:17:59,714
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1273
01:17:59,784 --> 01:18:03,185
What does that mean?. Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?.

1274
01:18:03,254 --> 01:18:06,917
I'm tired
of all this cryptic bullshit.

1275
01:18:06,991 --> 01:18:09,551
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1276
01:18:09,627 --> 01:18:12,892
and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1277
01:18:12,963 --> 01:18:15,363
unless you come clean right now.

1278
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:17,526
Why me?.

1279
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:21,093
Out of all the people
on the goddamn planet, whywas I tapped?.

1280
01:18:21,172 --> 01:18:24,107
Imagineyou're a 1 2-year-old boy.

1281
01:18:25,343 --> 01:18:29,370
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1282
01:18:29,447 --> 01:18:33,042
How long doyou think it would take to
come to grips with something that huge?.

1283
01:18:33,117 --> 01:18:35,779
Maybe, say, 1 8 years?.

1284
01:18:35,853 --> 01:18:40,950
In the Bible,Jesus suddenly
goes from age 1 2 to 30. 1 2 to 30.

1285
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:43,255
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1286
01:18:43,327 --> 01:18:46,262
Where are the volumes oftext
dealing with the missing 1 8 years?.

1287
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,661
I'll tell you where.

1288
01:18:47,732 --> 01:18:52,465
Theywere offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1289
01:18:52,536 --> 01:18:55,562
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1290
01:18:55,639 --> 01:18:58,403
to cover up
""the truth about Christ.""

1291
01:19:00,745 --> 01:19:02,178
Oh, bullshit.

1292
01:19:02,246 --> 01:19:04,237
Any important material
about Christ...

1293
01:19:04,315 --> 01:19:06,909
would give people a better understanding
ofthe nature ofGod.

1294
01:19:06,984 --> 01:19:11,011
- Whywould they leave any ofit out?.
- Because it's tied in with His family.

1295
01:19:11,088 --> 01:19:14,114
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1296
01:19:14,191 --> 01:19:18,457
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Marywas a virgin.

1297
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:22,898
Mary gave birth to Christ without having
known a man's touch. This is true.

1298
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,901
But she did have a husband.

1299
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:28,666
Doyou really think hewould've stayed
married to her for all thoseyears...

1300
01:19:28,739 --> 01:19:30,331
ifhe wasn't gettin' laid?.

1301
01:19:30,408 --> 01:19:33,844
The nature ofGod and theVirgin Birth,
those are leaps offaith.

1302
01:19:33,911 --> 01:19:38,177
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1303
01:19:38,249 --> 01:19:39,375
Meaning?.

1304
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:41,384
The blood that flows
through yourveins...

1305
01:19:41,452 --> 01:19:44,148
shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1306
01:19:44,221 --> 01:19:45,984
with the oneyou call Jesus.

1307
01:19:47,057 --> 01:19:48,957
Bethany, you are...

1308
01:19:49,026 --> 01:19:54,054
the great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandniece...

1309
01:19:54,131 --> 01:19:56,065
ofJesus Christ.

1310
01:19:59,937 --> 01:20:03,964
So, that would make Bethany
part black?.

1311
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,613
I can't do this anymore.

1312
01:20:15,753 --> 01:20:19,052
Whereyou gonna go?.
You know what I'm saying is right.

1313
01:20:19,123 --> 01:20:20,920
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1314
01:20:20,991 --> 01:20:22,583
It's bullshit!

1315
01:20:26,263 --> 01:20:28,629
Let her go, man.

1316
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:30,189
Give her time.

1317
01:20:37,508 --> 01:20:39,533
Why?.

1318
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:42,545
What the fuck do You want from me?.

1319
01:20:42,613 --> 01:20:45,013
I fucking hate You!

1320
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,611
I hate You.

1321
01:20:47,685 --> 01:20:49,949
He can't hearyou, you know.

1322
01:20:55,693 --> 01:20:57,752
That's whywe needed you.

1323
01:20:57,828 --> 01:21:00,126
Why didn'tyou tell me?.

1324
01:21:00,197 --> 01:21:01,357
Would you--

1325
01:21:02,433 --> 01:21:04,731
Could you have believed me?.

1326
01:21:05,503 --> 01:21:08,028
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1327
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:11,237
Only after everything you've seen...

1328
01:21:12,376 --> 01:21:13,468
everything you've heard...

1329
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:18,573
could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1330
01:21:18,649 --> 01:21:20,640
I don't want this.

1331
01:21:23,888 --> 01:21:25,947
It's too big.

1332
01:21:26,023 --> 01:21:27,718
That's whatJesus said.

1333
01:21:29,894 --> 01:21:31,828
I had to tell Him.

1334
01:21:35,032 --> 01:21:38,058
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1335
01:21:39,136 --> 01:21:41,468
not to be able
to tell the Son Himself...

1336
01:21:41,539 --> 01:21:44,531
because oneword from His lips would
destroythe boy's frail human form.

1337
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:47,975
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1338
01:21:48,045 --> 01:21:50,275
who wanted nothing more
than to playwith other children.

1339
01:21:50,347 --> 01:21:54,477
I had to tell this little boy
that He was God's only son...

1340
01:21:54,552 --> 01:21:57,487
and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1341
01:21:57,555 --> 01:22:00,786
at the hands ofthe very people
He'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1342
01:22:02,993 --> 01:22:05,154
He begged me to take it all back.

1343
01:22:06,564 --> 01:22:08,156
As ifl could.

1344
01:22:09,867 --> 01:22:12,665
He begged me to
""make it all not true.""

1345
01:22:12,736 --> 01:22:17,139
I'll letyou in on something, Bethany,
something I've never told anyone before.

1346
01:22:18,609 --> 01:22:20,543
Ifl had the power...

1347
01:22:22,012 --> 01:22:23,445
I would have.

1348
01:22:24,181 --> 01:22:25,375
It's unfair.

1349
01:22:25,449 --> 01:22:29,112
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1350
01:22:29,186 --> 01:22:31,484
and to askyou to do the same now.

1351
01:22:31,555 --> 01:22:33,284
I sympathize. I do.

1352
01:22:33,357 --> 01:22:35,791
I wish I could take it all back.

1353
01:22:38,262 --> 01:22:39,854
But I can't.

1354
01:22:42,733 --> 01:22:44,166
This...

1355
01:22:45,402 --> 01:22:47,495
is whoyou are.

1356
01:22:49,406 --> 01:22:52,000
Everything I am has been a lie?.

1357
01:22:56,046 --> 01:23:00,642
Knowing whatyou now know
doesn't mean you're not whoyou were.

1358
01:23:00,718 --> 01:23:01,844
You are...

1359
01:23:01,919 --> 01:23:03,511
Bethany Sloane.

1360
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:06,522
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1361
01:23:08,392 --> 01:23:13,125
All this means is
a redefinition ofthat identity.

1362
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:16,826
The incorporation ofthis new data
into whoyou are.

1363
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,095
Be whoyou've always been.

1364
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,330
Just...

1365
01:23:22,272 --> 01:23:23,899
be this as well...

1366
01:23:25,643 --> 01:23:28,168
from time to time.

1367
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:34,684
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1368
01:23:34,752 --> 01:23:37,016
To say the least.

1369
01:23:45,162 --> 01:23:47,722
Doyou mind ifwe adjourn
to somewhere...

1370
01:23:47,798 --> 01:23:50,426
a tad more habitable...

1371
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:52,093
and a bit warmer?.

1372
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:09,646
Fuck, I think this shit
just kicked in.

1373
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,587
Weren't we just in the woods?.
What are we doing here now?.

1374
01:24:12,656 --> 01:24:14,647
Going out in style.

1375
01:24:14,725 --> 01:24:17,319
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1376
01:24:17,394 --> 01:24:19,225
Now, who's this motherfucker?.

1377
01:24:19,296 --> 01:24:21,491
The voice ofGod.
Show some respect.

1378
01:24:21,565 --> 01:24:23,999
Oh, the voice ofGod.
Where's the rest of Him?.

1379
01:24:24,068 --> 01:24:26,332
Funnyyou should mention that.
We're not sure.

1380
01:24:26,403 --> 01:24:29,167
- What?.
- Didn't it ever occur toyou...

1381
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:33,266
that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of His control?.

1382
01:24:33,343 --> 01:24:35,106
Yes, but then whywas she tapped?.

1383
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:39,172
You know those constitutionals
that He likes to take?.

1384
01:24:39,249 --> 01:24:40,511
""Constitutionals""?.

1385
01:24:40,584 --> 01:24:43,075
I thinkwe're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1386
01:24:43,153 --> 01:24:45,087
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1387
01:24:46,356 --> 01:24:49,416
The Lord has quite a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it foryears.

1388
01:24:49,493 --> 01:24:51,518
He assumes a human form once a month
and indulges.

1389
01:24:51,595 --> 01:24:55,122
Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing.
He just goes away for a couple ofhours.

1390
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,828
And He always gives His free points away
to neighborhood children.

1391
01:24:58,902 --> 01:25:00,335
Isn't that sweet?.

1392
01:25:00,404 --> 01:25:03,999
But She hasn't come back
from one ofthese day trips?.

1393
01:25:04,074 --> 01:25:06,474
No, ""She"" hasn't...

1394
01:25:06,543 --> 01:25:09,376
and we've been unable to locate "" Her.""

1395
01:25:09,446 --> 01:25:12,779
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1396
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:16,718
No, there's a different sort
offoul play afoot, children.

1397
01:25:17,855 --> 01:25:21,347
Whomever has set the renegade angels
on their path...

1398
01:25:21,425 --> 01:25:23,859
and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1399
01:25:23,927 --> 01:25:26,919
is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1400
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,261
Were He to be killed in human form...

1401
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,995
He'd have returned
immediately to Heaven.

1402
01:25:32,069 --> 01:25:34,060
Someone knew enough...

1403
01:25:34,138 --> 01:25:36,265
to keep Him biologically alive...

1404
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,309
but incapacitate Him
in another fashion.

1405
01:25:39,376 --> 01:25:42,140
And as omnipotent as we are above...

1406
01:25:42,212 --> 01:25:45,670
I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without His presence.

1407
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:47,683
We've looked everywhere for Him.

1408
01:25:47,751 --> 01:25:52,620
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind this.

1409
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:55,988
But whoever he is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys afteryou...

1410
01:25:56,059 --> 01:25:58,152
as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1411
01:25:58,228 --> 01:25:59,991
Could it be Lucifer?.

1412
01:26:00,063 --> 01:26:01,462
Not Lucifer.

1413
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:05,059
Ifhe was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1414
01:26:05,135 --> 01:26:08,070
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1415
01:26:08,138 --> 01:26:11,369
because he's had just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1416
01:26:11,441 --> 01:26:12,908
What do we do now?.

1417
01:26:12,976 --> 01:26:15,843
I saywe get drunk,
'cause I'm all out ofideas.

1418
01:26:15,913 --> 01:26:18,882
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?.

1419
01:26:18,949 --> 01:26:20,780
I beg your pardon?.

1420
01:26:20,851 --> 01:26:22,785
The guy in charge
ofthe church thing.

1421
01:26:25,622 --> 01:26:27,522
Cardinal Glick?.

1422
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:29,752
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1423
01:26:29,827 --> 01:26:33,194
Ifit's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed orwhatever, right?.

1424
01:26:33,263 --> 01:26:34,560
Good Lord.

1425
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:36,690
The little stoner's got a point.

1426
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:41,363
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
cancelling the rededication ceremony.

1427
01:26:41,438 --> 01:26:43,463
""We""?.

1428
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,634
Areyou saying you're back in,
Ms. I-Don't-Think-I-Can-Do-This-Anymore?.

1429
01:26:50,948 --> 01:26:54,281
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now would I?.

1430
01:26:57,154 --> 01:26:58,086
Well...

1431
01:26:59,323 --> 01:27:03,157
the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1432
01:27:03,227 --> 01:27:06,390
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1433
01:27:06,463 --> 01:27:10,957
but ifwe can let 'em know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1434
01:27:11,034 --> 01:27:14,094
we can win 'em back,
even get some new ones.

1435
01:27:14,171 --> 01:27:15,763
Excuse me.

1436
01:27:17,808 --> 01:27:19,435
Fill them pews, people.

1437
01:27:19,509 --> 01:27:22,444
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1438
01:27:22,512 --> 01:27:25,003
Hook 'em while they'reyoung.

1439
01:27:25,082 --> 01:27:29,246
- Kinda like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if onlywe had their numbers.

1440
01:27:29,319 --> 01:27:32,447
We really appreciateyou seeing us
this late in the day, Your Eminence.

1441
01:27:32,522 --> 01:27:36,117
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope oftalking toyou...

1442
01:27:36,193 --> 01:27:38,684
about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1443
01:27:38,762 --> 01:27:41,253
You looking to help out in some way?.

1444
01:27:41,331 --> 01:27:44,129
We'd likeyou to cancel the ceremony.

1445
01:27:45,202 --> 01:27:46,829
I beg your pardon.

1446
01:27:46,904 --> 01:27:50,931
There's gonna be a world oftrouble if
tomorrow's ceremony goes on as planned.

1447
01:27:52,009 --> 01:27:54,842
Areyou pro-choice?.

1448
01:27:54,912 --> 01:27:56,504
The trouble's not from us.

1449
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:59,947
It's from these renegade angels that've
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1450
01:28:02,686 --> 01:28:05,211
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1451
01:28:05,289 --> 01:28:07,484
See, Padre, it goes down like this.

1452
01:28:07,557 --> 01:28:12,290
These guys think that by passing through
that archway, they can go to Heaven.

1453
01:28:12,362 --> 01:28:15,991
You want me to call offthe ceremony
for that.

1454
01:28:17,067 --> 01:28:18,193
Who sentyou?.

1455
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:23,330
We were sent
by Him who is called I Am!

1456
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:26,001
Cute. Really cute.

1457
01:28:26,076 --> 01:28:28,476
Playtime with the cardinal is over.

1458
01:28:28,545 --> 01:28:31,173
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out ofthis.

1459
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:32,875
It's not a joke.

1460
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:36,044
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1461
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:39,088
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1462
01:28:39,156 --> 01:28:42,091
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent ofthe slave trade?.

1463
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,719
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?.

1464
01:28:44,795 --> 01:28:47,229
All right, mistakes were made.

1465
01:28:47,297 --> 01:28:50,391
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1466
01:28:50,467 --> 01:28:52,492
responsible for the oversights of old.

1467
01:28:52,569 --> 01:28:56,335
I'm a very important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1468
01:28:56,406 --> 01:28:57,896
so ifyou please--

1469
01:28:57,975 --> 01:29:00,739
- But tomorrow--
- Tomorrow goes offwithout a hitch.

1470
01:29:00,811 --> 01:29:02,176
Do I make myself clear?.

1471
01:29:02,245 --> 01:29:06,909
Neitheryou nor any other influence
short ofthe hand ofGod Himself...

1472
01:29:06,984 --> 01:29:09,919
is gonna keep this thing
from going offwithout a hitch.

1473
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,932
I can see the headlines now...

1474
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:34,944
ifthere were gonna be any.

1475
01:29:35,012 --> 01:29:36,639
"" Existence Erased.""

1476
01:29:36,713 --> 01:29:38,943
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1477
01:29:39,016 --> 01:29:41,382
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1478
01:29:43,887 --> 01:29:45,047
What up.

1479
01:29:45,122 --> 01:29:47,386
You stole the cardinal's driver?.

1480
01:29:47,457 --> 01:29:49,618
That's what he gets
for messin' with our girlfriend.

1481
01:29:49,693 --> 01:29:51,456
Cross-dressin' fuck.

1482
01:29:51,528 --> 01:29:53,962
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1483
01:29:55,732 --> 01:29:58,667
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?.

1484
01:29:58,735 --> 01:30:01,932
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill 'em.

1485
01:30:02,005 --> 01:30:04,132
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1486
01:30:05,742 --> 01:30:08,472
Theywon't be killed.

1487
01:30:08,545 --> 01:30:11,605
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1488
01:30:11,681 --> 01:30:12,943
right here...

1489
01:30:13,016 --> 01:30:16,076
until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1490
01:30:17,187 --> 01:30:19,246
There's only one idiot here,
Azrael...

1491
01:30:22,559 --> 01:30:24,720
and I'm looking right at him.

1492
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:26,319
Muse!

1493
01:30:27,664 --> 01:30:30,792
Just in time tojoin us
for a drink.

1494
01:30:32,269 --> 01:30:33,361
Hey.
Where'd you come from?.

1495
01:30:35,205 --> 01:30:37,139
- Where'd you come from?.
- Me?.

1496
01:30:37,207 --> 01:30:38,731
Nothingness.

1497
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:42,540
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1498
01:30:42,612 --> 01:30:46,173
All right, Plato,
sounds likeyou've had enough already.

1499
01:30:46,249 --> 01:30:48,740
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1500
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:52,482
Come on, barkeep,just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?.

1501
01:30:52,556 --> 01:30:55,684
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1502
01:30:55,759 --> 01:30:57,522
Is that who I think it is?.

1503
01:30:57,594 --> 01:30:58,891
- None other than.
- Who is he?.

1504
01:30:58,962 --> 01:31:01,726
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1505
01:31:01,798 --> 01:31:03,959
Give me a...

1506
01:31:04,034 --> 01:31:06,502
Holy Bartender.

1507
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:08,470
Never heard ofit.

1508
01:31:08,538 --> 01:31:12,406
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1509
01:31:12,476 --> 01:31:14,410
You do, don'tyou, Muse?.

1510
01:31:14,478 --> 01:31:15,536
Don't.

1511
01:31:16,646 --> 01:31:17,806
Anybody?.

1512
01:31:17,881 --> 01:31:19,371
No?.

1513
01:31:19,449 --> 01:31:22,976
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1514
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:32,653
Get it?.

1515
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:34,993
Sweet Jesus, Azrael!
Why?.

1516
01:31:35,065 --> 01:31:38,592
Come on, Demon! Try that shit
on somebodywho's already dead!

1517
01:31:38,668 --> 01:31:42,104
Oh, Apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1518
01:31:42,172 --> 01:31:45,198
and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1519
01:31:45,275 --> 01:31:47,436
The Christ bitch will join you.

1520
01:31:47,511 --> 01:31:50,674
Areyou really that stupid?.

1521
01:31:50,747 --> 01:31:54,274
You do know what's gonna happen
ifthose two jerks enter that church.

1522
01:31:54,351 --> 01:31:56,717
I'm actually counting on it.

1523
01:31:57,954 --> 01:32:00,115
And if my calculations
are correct...

1524
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,920
the pawns are moving into checkmate
as we speak.

1525
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:11,425
"" Holy Bartender."" I get it.
That's a great one!

1526
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:15,733
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1527
01:32:15,805 --> 01:32:17,602
for coming this morning.

1528
01:32:17,674 --> 01:32:20,609
She's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1529
01:32:22,279 --> 01:32:26,978
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
ofhistory about this particular...

1530
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,712
hundred-years-young house ofGod.

1531
01:32:29,786 --> 01:32:31,083
God's house?.

1532
01:32:32,455 --> 01:32:35,185
God doesn't live here anymore.

1533
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:38,056
He's grown weary
ofyour superficial faith.

1534
01:32:38,128 --> 01:32:41,063
He's turned a deaf ear
toyour lip-service prayers.

1535
01:32:41,131 --> 01:32:44,464
- He has abandoned you, his favorites...
- Sorry.

1536
01:32:44,534 --> 01:32:46,468
to the whim ofjudgment.

1537
01:32:46,536 --> 01:32:49,061
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1538
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:53,368
prepare to taste God's wrath.

1539
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:56,378
-Maybe we should just leave.
-You wanted your body count. You got it.

1540
01:32:56,446 --> 01:32:59,074
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1541
01:32:59,149 --> 01:33:00,411
Officer McGhee.

1542
01:33:01,218 --> 01:33:02,981
All right, mouthpiece...

1543
01:33:03,053 --> 01:33:05,851
Iet's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1544
01:33:05,922 --> 01:33:08,322
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1545
01:33:08,391 --> 01:33:10,325
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

1546
01:33:10,393 --> 01:33:12,258
Is that so?.

1547
01:33:16,533 --> 01:33:18,296
Ladies and gentlemen...

1548
01:33:18,368 --> 01:33:23,863
you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1549
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:26,340
and this very day...

1550
01:33:26,409 --> 01:33:30,175
I assureyou you will all
pay foryour trespasses...

1551
01:33:30,247 --> 01:33:32,010
in blood.

1552
01:33:32,082 --> 01:33:34,380
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1553
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:35,509
Do it!

1554
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,450
- So he's a muse too?.
- Former muse.

1555
01:33:41,124 --> 01:33:44,525
He was kicked out.

1556
01:33:44,594 --> 01:33:47,062
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1557
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:48,222
Then what happened?.

1558
01:33:48,298 --> 01:33:50,459
Yes, what?.

1559
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:54,492
Well, Luciferjust had to start
his little war for the throne.

1560
01:33:54,571 --> 01:33:57,131
Heaven became divided
into two factions--

1561
01:33:57,207 --> 01:33:59,402
the faithful and the renegades.

1562
01:33:59,476 --> 01:34:02,309
Oh, the Ethereal Plains
were chaotic with battle.

1563
01:34:02,379 --> 01:34:05,177
Angel against angel.

1564
01:34:05,248 --> 01:34:08,684
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1565
01:34:08,752 --> 01:34:10,652
But Azrael refused to fight.

1566
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:14,212
He remained in the middle,
waiting to see who came out victorious.

1567
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:16,384
What areyou,
some kind offuckin' chicken?.

1568
01:34:16,459 --> 01:34:17,756
No.

1569
01:34:17,827 --> 01:34:19,692
I was an artist...

1570
01:34:19,763 --> 01:34:21,890
stupid!

1571
01:34:21,965 --> 01:34:23,626
I was inspiration!

1572
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,191
A muse has no place in battle.

1573
01:34:26,269 --> 01:34:28,999
So after the fallen
were banished to Hell...

1574
01:34:29,072 --> 01:34:31,006
God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1575
01:34:31,074 --> 01:34:33,440
and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1576
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:36,308
something he considers
a great injustice.

1577
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,540
Oh, come on.

1578
01:34:38,615 --> 01:34:41,675
Don't tell meyou never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1579
01:34:41,751 --> 01:34:44,515
No.
It never bothered me.

1580
01:34:44,587 --> 01:34:46,612
Soyou were an artist.

1581
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:48,453
Big deal!

1582
01:34:48,525 --> 01:34:50,584
Elvis was an artist...

1583
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:54,027
but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time ofwar.

1584
01:34:54,097 --> 01:34:56,031
That's why he is the king...

1585
01:34:56,099 --> 01:34:58,033
and you're a schmuck.

1586
01:34:58,101 --> 01:34:59,261
Nice.

1587
01:34:59,336 --> 01:35:01,236
So all this is about revenge.

1588
01:35:01,304 --> 01:35:04,296
You're gonna unmake existence
becauseyou have a grudge against God?.

1589
01:35:04,374 --> 01:35:08,140
After the first million years?.
No.

1590
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:12,045
Escape from Hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1591
01:35:12,115 --> 01:35:16,609
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1592
01:35:16,686 --> 01:35:18,210
which it finally did...

1593
01:35:18,288 --> 01:35:20,256
in Catholicism.

1594
01:35:20,323 --> 01:35:21,585
Plenary indulgence.

1595
01:35:21,658 --> 01:35:23,558
But I couldn't exercise it.

1596
01:35:23,626 --> 01:35:26,094
Demons can't become human.

1597
01:35:26,162 --> 01:35:28,323
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1598
01:35:29,799 --> 01:35:31,266
But angels can.

1599
01:35:32,502 --> 01:35:33,833
Bartleby and Loki.

1600
01:35:35,538 --> 01:35:38,564
After that it was a simple matter
ofwaiting for a church...

1601
01:35:38,641 --> 01:35:40,438
to celebrate their centennial...

1602
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:46,142
and when that finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1603
01:35:46,216 --> 01:35:48,150
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1604
01:35:48,218 --> 01:35:50,345
kept them cloaked
and off Heaven's radars.

1605
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:53,583
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1606
01:35:53,656 --> 01:35:57,456
no soul in Hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1607
01:35:57,527 --> 01:36:00,519
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1608
01:36:00,597 --> 01:36:04,089
so I dispatched Him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1609
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:06,601
Her. And how?.

1610
01:36:06,669 --> 01:36:09,263
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1611
01:36:09,339 --> 01:36:12,274
Oh, no, I've seen
way too many Bond movies to know...

1612
01:36:12,342 --> 01:36:15,277
thatyou never reveal
all the details ofyour plan...

1613
01:36:15,345 --> 01:36:18,781
no matter how close
you may thinkyou are to winning.

1614
01:36:18,848 --> 01:36:22,045
The only ""X"" factorwas the involvement
ofthe last scion here.

1615
01:36:23,386 --> 01:36:27,482
But fat lot of good that did, right?.
I mean, hereyou all are.

1616
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:33,423
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1617
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:37,626
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules toyou...

1618
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:41,602
but ifyou succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1619
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:44,640
Human, haveyou ever been to Hell?.

1620
01:36:44,707 --> 01:36:46,902
I think not.

1621
01:36:46,976 --> 01:36:49,240
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1622
01:36:49,312 --> 01:36:53,646
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1623
01:36:53,716 --> 01:36:56,241
Still thinking only aboutyourself...

1624
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:58,253
you fucking child!

1625
01:36:58,321 --> 01:37:00,414
Now, now, now.

1626
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:04,317
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1627
01:37:04,394 --> 01:37:06,954
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?.

1628
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,998
Yo, put on channel 9.
Daveyand Goliath.

1629
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,803
Actually, I was thinking
more along the lines of current events.

1630
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,305
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

1631
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:20,240
I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...

1632
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:22,471
have laid waste to St. Michael's!

1633
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:24,911
Bullets don't seem to affect them!

1634
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:28,650
The remainder ofthe crowd
have dropped to their knees...

1635
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:31,084
identifying this
as the fabled apocalypse.

1636
01:37:31,154 --> 01:37:34,021
Now, I'm not a man offaith,
but I'm inclined to agree.

1637
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:38,288
Oh, God, please, don 't come any closer!
God, no!

1638
01:37:46,369 --> 01:37:49,600
You see that?.
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1639
01:37:49,672 --> 01:37:53,267
I 'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not going to matter anyway.

1640
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:58,437
Oh?.

1641
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:02,350
Oh, now what was that
all about?.

1642
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:04,045
What?.

1643
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:06,611
Oh, nothing.

1644
01:38:06,689 --> 01:38:08,850
I had something in my eye.

1645
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:11,689
Now who's the fucking child?.

1646
01:38:12,862 --> 01:38:16,059
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?.

1647
01:38:16,733 --> 01:38:20,396
Areyou serious?. I'm a fucking demon.
You'd have him assault mewith a putter?.

1648
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,530
You want to play?.
Then we'll play.

1649
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:25,403
One side, Red.

1650
01:38:26,142 --> 01:38:27,837
Go ahead, then.
Pick it up.

1651
01:38:27,911 --> 01:38:29,071
Call it a gift.

1652
01:38:30,547 --> 01:38:32,538
Come on.

1653
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:34,048
That's it.

1654
01:38:35,585 --> 01:38:37,177
Take a shot.

1655
01:38:37,253 --> 01:38:40,848
Takeyour best fucking shot.

1656
01:38:42,325 --> 01:38:44,725
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1657
01:38:45,895 --> 01:38:47,829
Come on, bright boy.

1658
01:38:55,672 --> 01:38:58,436
Don'tyou know anything?.

1659
01:39:13,923 --> 01:39:15,857
Bethany, bless the sink!

1660
01:39:15,925 --> 01:39:17,790
- What?.
-Just do it!

1661
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,851
Bless the sink, damn it!

1662
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,315
That's whatyou get,
motherfucker.

1663
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:51,053
But I'm a fucking demon.

1664
01:39:58,368 --> 01:39:59,630
What just happened?.

1665
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:02,364
He said it himself;.
""I'm a fucking demon.""

1666
01:40:02,438 --> 01:40:06,807
Hit a demon with an instrument ofGod,
the pure side so it'll do some damage.

1667
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:08,935
Silent Bob's an instrument ofGod?.

1668
01:40:09,012 --> 01:40:12,948
No, but Glick's the kind ofasshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1669
01:40:13,016 --> 01:40:16,076
- But the sink?.
- You've got the divine heritage.

1670
01:40:16,152 --> 01:40:18,416
Sanctifying is just
one ofthe fringe benefits.

1671
01:40:18,488 --> 01:40:20,922
Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing
at my next party.

1672
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:24,187
- How far away is this church?.
- Three towns over, about ten miles.

1673
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,194
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead ofyou.

1674
01:40:26,262 --> 01:40:28,492
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1675
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:31,795
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1676
01:40:43,613 --> 01:40:45,308
Oh, my God.

1677
01:40:58,094 --> 01:41:00,824
And people wonderwhy
I don't go to church anymore.

1678
01:41:00,897 --> 01:41:02,159
Are we too late?.

1679
01:41:02,231 --> 01:41:04,825
To save these poor schmucks?.

1680
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:07,694
Yeah.

1681
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:10,432
But we still exist.

1682
01:41:10,506 --> 01:41:12,337
Where are they?.

1683
01:41:12,408 --> 01:41:14,899
They could already be
in the church.

1684
01:41:14,977 --> 01:41:17,070
Which means ifthey come out,
nobody touches them.

1685
01:41:17,146 --> 01:41:18,579
Areyou shitting me?.

1686
01:41:18,648 --> 01:41:22,675
The brother here is gonna shred 'em with
his angel-be-good special. Huh, homey?.

1687
01:41:22,752 --> 01:41:24,686
Ifthey pass through that arch,
they come out clean.

1688
01:41:24,754 --> 01:41:26,881
And ifthey die,
they go straight up.

1689
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:29,390
And hello!
We know what happens then, right?.

1690
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:31,859
- Why don't theyjust kill themselves?.
- It's a mortal sin.

1691
01:41:31,928 --> 01:41:34,761
Die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They don't want to go to hell.

1692
01:41:34,831 --> 01:41:38,699
Then what, are we supposed to just wait
for a solution to fall from the sky?.

1693
01:41:42,905 --> 01:41:44,270
Friend ofyours?.

1694
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,274
No, that was a cardinal.

1695
01:41:46,342 --> 01:41:50,176
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1696
01:41:50,246 --> 01:41:52,840
It's one ofthem!
Kill that motherfucker!

1697
01:41:52,915 --> 01:41:54,177
Don'tyou listen?.

1698
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:57,242
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1699
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,618
He's been at it for a while now.

1700
01:41:59,689 --> 01:42:01,281
Please! Please!

1701
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:04,392
We ran out of parishioners...

1702
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:08,794
so he just started picking up folk
offthe road and just dropping 'em.

1703
01:42:08,865 --> 01:42:12,096
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1704
01:42:13,102 --> 01:42:15,229
If only they'd let us jerk off.

1705
01:42:16,606 --> 01:42:18,369
Whoops.
Take a step back.

1706
01:42:22,712 --> 01:42:24,145
Let me go!

1707
01:42:25,281 --> 01:42:27,579
Why?.
What areyou trying to prove?.

1708
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:31,051
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1709
01:42:32,054 --> 01:42:33,487
Jesus Christ!

1710
01:42:34,824 --> 01:42:36,758
I just wanted to go home.

1711
01:42:36,826 --> 01:42:38,657
But him, you know...

1712
01:42:38,728 --> 01:42:41,128
he just lost it.

1713
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:44,428
He realized whoyou were
and whatyou were gonna have to do.

1714
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,967
He just snapped.

1715
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:49,664
The funny thing is, this guy
could never even stand to see me work.

1716
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:52,833
He said he felt sorry
foryou people.

1717
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:55,434
Now look at him.

1718
01:42:55,511 --> 01:42:57,570
This guy's fuckin' drunker than hell.

1719
01:42:57,647 --> 01:43:00,138
Which means he's human now.

1720
01:43:01,517 --> 01:43:03,610
His wings have been cut off.

1721
01:43:10,226 --> 01:43:12,160
The muse?.

1722
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:14,321
Oh, no way!

1723
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:17,195
I haven't seen you--
You look terrific. Wow!

1724
01:43:17,266 --> 01:43:19,427
What's with the tits?.
Can I--

1725
01:43:19,502 --> 01:43:21,766
Haveyou walked
through the arch yet?.

1726
01:43:25,141 --> 01:43:28,702
Tell me. Have you gone in
and come out through the archwayyet?.

1727
01:43:28,778 --> 01:43:30,143
No!

1728
01:43:35,218 --> 01:43:36,651
He's back.

1729
01:43:59,976 --> 01:44:01,910
We were awaiting your arrival.

1730
01:44:01,978 --> 01:44:05,038
Bartleby, wait. Stop.
Listen to me.

1731
01:44:05,114 --> 01:44:07,844
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1732
01:44:07,917 --> 01:44:09,179
Ifyou go back--

1733
01:44:10,052 --> 01:44:13,044
I've become aware ofthe repercussions.
I know what I'm doing.

1734
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:16,185
You sick, twisted fuck!

1735
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,022
Bethany.

1736
01:44:22,198 --> 01:44:25,531
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1737
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:28,536
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1738
01:44:28,604 --> 01:44:31,664
Butyou've only dealt with the pain
a fewyears.

1739
01:44:31,741 --> 01:44:34,835
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1740
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:39,348
Whileyou never seeyour ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his newwife--

1741
01:44:40,917 --> 01:44:42,179
and he is--

1742
01:44:45,354 --> 01:44:50,087
seeing you people every day on this
perfect world He created foryou...

1743
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:51,888
is a constant reminder...

1744
01:44:51,961 --> 01:44:55,021
that though my kind came first...

1745
01:44:55,097 --> 01:44:57,190
your kind was most revered.

1746
01:44:58,434 --> 01:45:00,800
And whileyou know forgiveness...

1747
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:02,804
we know only regret.

1748
01:45:03,873 --> 01:45:05,704
The lesson must be taught.

1749
01:45:05,775 --> 01:45:07,709
All are accountable...

1750
01:45:07,777 --> 01:45:09,039
even God.

1751
01:45:10,313 --> 01:45:12,508
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1752
01:45:12,581 --> 01:45:15,846
just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1753
01:45:17,086 --> 01:45:20,578
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1754
01:45:20,656 --> 01:45:22,146
will cease to be.

1755
01:45:22,224 --> 01:45:23,782
No. Hey. Hey!

1756
01:45:26,495 --> 01:45:28,429
I can't letyou do that,
Bartleby.

1757
01:45:28,497 --> 01:45:30,590
This has gone too far.

1758
01:45:32,568 --> 01:45:35,002
I might have to takeyou down.

1759
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:38,370
It's okay. Shh.

1760
01:45:38,441 --> 01:45:40,033
I'll do it.

1761
01:45:44,814 --> 01:45:46,748
My compatriot.

1762
01:45:48,084 --> 01:45:50,644
Genocide takes a lot out ofhim.

1763
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,982
He's weakened.

1764
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:53,521
You're weak.

1765
01:45:53,589 --> 01:45:56,422
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1766
01:45:56,492 --> 01:45:58,687
a condition which carries
two liabilities--

1767
01:46:00,496 --> 01:46:02,293
a conscience...

1768
01:46:03,099 --> 01:46:04,532
and...

1769
01:46:07,536 --> 01:46:10,130
a short life span.

1770
01:46:10,206 --> 01:46:13,004
I'm sorry, old friend,
butyou lost the faith.

1771
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:42,704
He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1772
01:46:42,772 --> 01:46:45,070
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1773
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:47,875
I can't believe this.

1774
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:50,571
We're on the brink of nonexistence,
and God's still nowhere to be found.

1775
01:46:50,646 --> 01:46:53,740
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?.
- Amen to that.

1776
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:02,750
What the hell areyou doing?.

1777
01:47:02,825 --> 01:47:06,352
Ifthe whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1778
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:13,334
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1779
01:47:13,402 --> 01:47:16,997
We can lay here all comatose like that
John DoeJersey bastard over there...

1780
01:47:17,073 --> 01:47:20,008
- orwe can get makin' with the love.
- What did you say?.

1781
01:47:20,076 --> 01:47:22,169
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1782
01:47:22,244 --> 01:47:23,768
No, aboutJohn DoeJersey.

1783
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:30,575
That guy, the one theywon't take
offlife support--John DoeJersey.

1784
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:32,712
This is where he's at--
St. Michael's Hospital.

1785
01:47:34,256 --> 01:47:35,723
Where's the nearest boardwalk?.

1786
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:38,419
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1787
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:40,962
- Where is it?.
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1788
01:47:41,030 --> 01:47:43,089
- Haveyou ever been there?.
- Once, with this chick.

1789
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:46,191
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1790
01:47:46,268 --> 01:47:48,133
- Do they have skeeball there?.
- Yeah.

1791
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:53,474
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1792
01:48:01,484 --> 01:48:04,578
Whateveryou do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1793
01:48:04,653 --> 01:48:06,814
Bob, come with me.
Come on!

1794
01:48:06,889 --> 01:48:09,585
- How am I supposed to do that?.
- Think of something!

1795
01:48:09,658 --> 01:48:11,888
I already did,
but it takes two of us!

1796
01:48:12,728 --> 01:48:14,958
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1797
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:16,827
This is the apocalypse.

1798
01:48:16,899 --> 01:48:19,629
Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.

1799
01:48:19,702 --> 01:48:21,465
Thank you.

1800
01:48:36,886 --> 01:48:38,513
Hey, Big Bi rd!

1801
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,083
Ready for the counti ng game?.

1802
01:48:45,861 --> 01:48:47,829
Count the shel ls, Suck-a-Duck.

1803
01:49:16,025 --> 01:49:17,993
No more bullets.

1804
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:20,255
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?.

1805
01:49:20,329 --> 01:49:23,264
Angels have to cut theirwings off
to become human.

1806
01:49:23,332 --> 01:49:25,391
You just did him a favor,
stupid!

1807
01:50:12,147 --> 01:50:14,843
I hopeyou're the skeeball type.

1808
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:58,392
Oh, Bartleby.

1809
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:02,123
Was Wisconsin really that bad?.

1810
01:51:02,197 --> 01:51:04,290
Bow down, stupid!

1811
01:51:22,851 --> 01:51:24,785
I'm sorry.

1812
01:51:47,176 --> 01:51:50,373
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1813
01:51:50,446 --> 01:51:54,212
would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1814
01:51:54,283 --> 01:51:56,342
What the fuck?.

1815
01:52:02,491 --> 01:52:04,516
Thankyou.

1816
01:52:36,325 --> 01:52:37,986
It never ends!

1817
01:52:58,013 --> 01:53:00,106
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1818
01:53:00,182 --> 01:53:02,673
What the fuck is this shit?.

1819
01:53:02,751 --> 01:53:04,480
Who the fuck areyou, lady?.

1820
01:53:04,553 --> 01:53:07,021
Why the fuck did you hug my head?.

1821
01:53:07,089 --> 01:53:10,024
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?.

1822
01:53:10,092 --> 01:53:13,061
What the fuck is this, The Piano?.
Why ain't this broad talkin'?.

1823
01:53:13,128 --> 01:53:18,464
I believe the answers thatyou seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1824
01:53:18,534 --> 01:53:21,833
What the fuck does that mean?.
Has everyone gone fuckin' nuts?.

1825
01:53:21,904 --> 01:53:24,873
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head?.

1826
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:26,931
Shh.

1827
01:53:42,458 --> 01:53:44,153
Where was she?.

1828
01:53:44,226 --> 01:53:46,786
Imprisoned in a body.

1829
01:53:46,862 --> 01:53:49,797
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1830
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:52,892
Hang on a minute.

1831
01:54:27,369 --> 01:54:29,303
You missed a bit.

1832
01:54:30,839 --> 01:54:33,774
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?.

1833
01:54:33,842 --> 01:54:36,310
You ready to make some ofthose
changes I been talking about?.

1834
01:54:36,378 --> 01:54:37,538
We'll see.

1835
01:54:37,613 --> 01:54:39,171
Muse?.

1836
01:54:39,248 --> 01:54:41,842
Seeing as howyou
just had to get involved...

1837
01:54:41,917 --> 01:54:44,181
you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1838
01:54:44,253 --> 01:54:47,188
First I gotta say good-bye to Bethany.
Where is she?.

1839
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:48,689
Oh, no.

1840
01:55:09,945 --> 01:55:12,413
Metatron, is she--

1841
01:55:12,481 --> 01:55:14,813
Afraid so.

1842
01:55:14,883 --> 01:55:18,876
One ofthe drawbacks to being a martyr
is that you have to die.

1843
01:55:18,954 --> 01:55:21,514
But no matter.

1844
01:55:31,033 --> 01:55:32,967
All is being taken care of.

1845
01:55:34,069 --> 01:55:35,502
How so?.

1846
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:39,732
Wax on, wax off.

1847
01:56:03,298 --> 01:56:04,424
How did I--

1848
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:06,194
She can rebuild you.

1849
01:56:06,268 --> 01:56:07,860
She has the technology.

1850
01:56:07,936 --> 01:56:12,032
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1851
01:56:17,813 --> 01:56:18,939
That's...

1852
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:22,813
A very relieved deity.

1853
01:56:24,586 --> 01:56:27,282
You did well, little girl.
I knewyou'd come 'round.

1854
01:56:27,356 --> 01:56:29,790
Your kind always does.

1855
01:56:30,993 --> 01:56:33,461
You might want to
take good care ofyourself.

1856
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:36,326
We're gonna need you down the road.

1857
01:56:36,398 --> 01:56:38,866
I know.
I'm the last scion.

1858
01:56:41,536 --> 01:56:44,664
Well, you're half right.

1859
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:47,675
You were the last scion.

1860
01:56:49,411 --> 01:56:50,844
But now...

1861
01:56:51,913 --> 01:56:53,437
this...

1862
01:56:54,182 --> 01:56:56,275
is the last scion.

1863
01:56:59,321 --> 01:57:01,255
I'm pregnant?.

1864
01:57:03,592 --> 01:57:05,753
Can't put anything pastyou.

1865
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:11,589
Take care ofthat parcel for us.

1866
01:57:11,667 --> 01:57:15,603
She has a world ofwork
ahead ofher.

1867
01:57:27,015 --> 01:57:29,074
Thankyou for...

1868
01:57:29,151 --> 01:57:31,142
I don't know...

1869
01:57:31,219 --> 01:57:32,481
everything.

1870
01:57:36,224 --> 01:57:39,660
God, there's a million things
I wish I could askyou...

1871
01:57:39,728 --> 01:57:43,789
most ofit questioning your great plan,
and that'd be arrogant of me, I know.

1872
01:57:44,566 --> 01:57:46,693
But there is one I need to ask.

1873
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:50,397
I'm sureyou get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?.

1874
01:57:52,374 --> 01:57:54,342
Why are we here?.

1875
01:58:10,926 --> 01:58:13,861
Didn't I tell you she was funny?.

1876
01:58:20,736 --> 01:58:23,330
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1877
01:58:24,072 --> 01:58:26,233
It was an honor.

1878
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:33,847
You did so well.

1879
01:58:38,487 --> 01:58:41,422
I told you She was a woman.

1880
01:58:43,391 --> 01:58:45,757
She's not really a woman.

1881
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:48,295
She's not really anything.

1882
01:58:48,363 --> 01:58:50,024
She's something, all right.

1883
01:58:51,233 --> 01:58:53,463
Crisis offaith over?.

1884
01:58:53,535 --> 01:58:56,470
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1885
01:58:56,538 --> 01:58:58,472
When it rains, it pours.

1886
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:00,770
Areyou saying you believe?.

1887
01:59:02,077 --> 01:59:04,068
But I have a good idea.

1888
01:59:04,146 --> 01:59:05,579
Yes!

1889
01:59:09,518 --> 01:59:11,452
The Man was right aboutyou.

1890
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,546
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell Him so.

1891
01:59:15,457 --> 01:59:17,391
And ifyou clean upyour language...

1892
01:59:17,459 --> 01:59:19,927
I just might put in
a good word foryou too.

1893
01:59:19,995 --> 01:59:21,587
Thanks.

1894
01:59:23,131 --> 01:59:25,565
Why don'tyou name the kid
after me?.

1895
01:59:28,403 --> 01:59:30,166
Rufus.

1896
01:59:56,565 --> 01:59:58,999
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1897
02:00:03,839 --> 02:00:05,773
Youse guys
wanna hear something sick?.

1898
02:00:05,841 --> 02:00:08,776
I got half a stalk
when she kissed me.

1899
02:00:08,844 --> 02:00:11,278
I couldn't help it.
The bitch was hot.

1900
02:00:11,346 --> 02:00:15,908
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1901
02:00:15,984 --> 02:00:17,474
You're pregnant?.

1902
02:00:19,154 --> 02:00:22,681
You know, when you're pregnantyou can
have sex until the third trimester.

1903
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:24,691
I'll keep that in mind.

1904
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:08,621
So, that wouldmake Bethany
part black?
