They think of us as a passé,

You don't believe in God

No, Through the Looking Glass.

That poem, The Walrus
and the Carpenter,

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,401
that's an indictment
of organized religion.

The Walrus, with his girth
and his good nature,

he obviously represents
either Buddha

or with his tusks, the Hindu
elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

That takes care of

Now, in the poem, what do
they do? What do they do?

They dupe all these oysters
into following them,

and then proceed to suck and
devour the helpless creatures en masse.

Now, I don't know what that

that following these faiths

With a papal sanction, the archway entrance of
the century-old Jersey Shore house of worship

107
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,006
will serve as a passageway
of plenary indulgence,

108
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:09,345
a little-known Catholic belief which offers all that
passes through its arches a morally clean slate.

For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

arch thing, and then I can go back home?

111
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,688
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

112
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,441
Then all we have to do is die.
Die? I don't wanna die.

113
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,504
What, you rather hang around
here for a few more eons?

114
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,237
No. We don't even
know if we can die.

115
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,406
All right, but what if we can and
then the arch thing doesn't work?

116
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,075
What then, hell? Fuck that.

117
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,283
It's impossible.
Fuck that.

118
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,789
If we cut off our wings and transubstantiate
to complete human form, we become mortal.

119
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,477
If we die with clean souls, there's
no way they can keep us out.

120
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,545
We won't be angels any more,
but at least we get to go home.

121
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,923
Who sent the paper?
Who cares who sent the paper?

122
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,218
All that matters is that after all
these years, we found a loophole.

123
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,886
He can't keep us out any more.

124
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,449
And once we get back in,
I'm sure he'll just forgive and forget.

125
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,268
But this thing, this is Church law.
It's not divine mandate.

126
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,938
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

127
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,441
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope,

128
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,070
by the son of God
before he left was:

129
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,905
Whatever you hold
true on Earth...

130
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,365
I'll hold true in heaven.

131
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,410
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

132
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,203
This thing has a papal sanction...

133
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:21,041
Let it never be said that your anal retentive
attention to detail never yielded positive results.

134
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,711
You can't be anal retentive
if you don't have an anus.

135
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,754
Outstanding work!

136
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,674
Oh, there's just one thing I think
we gotta do before we leave.

137
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,722
This is gonna help us get
back on his good side.

138
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,094
What?

139
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,055

this for five years. Read that.

You really are just
a simple creature.

and you wanna jeopardize that

145
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,736
because you got a soft spot
for the good old days.

146

the position I once denied, thanks to you?

147

is gonna make things better for us.

148
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,788
Killing spree? I'm talking
about divine justice here.

149
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,334

and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

Where the hell are we?

00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,876
Only place you can go
for a good tequila.

309
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,920
Dos tequilas, por favour,
and an empty glass.

[WAITER] Sì.

We're in Mexico?

312
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,510
Actually, we're in the franchised
Mexican family eatery

313
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,679
down the street
from your apartment,

314
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,598
but it's impressive nonetheless.

315
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,267
You don't mind that I
lost the wings, do you?

316
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,352
I'm trying to keep
our profile low.

317
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,188
What do you want with me?

318
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,694
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

319
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,031
For the record, I work
in an abortion clinic.

320
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,450
Noah was a drunk.
Look what he accomplished.

321
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,494
And no one's asking you
to build an ark.

322
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,496
All you gotta do is
go to New Jersey

323
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,123
and visit a small church
on a very important day.

324
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,417
Oh. Gracias.

325
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,879
New Jersey?

326
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,174
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

327
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,718
Aside from the
fine print, that's it.

328
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,887
What's the fine print?

329
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,891
Stop a couple of angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

330
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,185
Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.

331
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,438
Stop a couple of angels
from entering

332
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,566
and thus negating all existence.

333
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,069
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

334
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,029
You might want to clarify that.

335
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,409
Back in the old days, God was
vengeful and hot-tempered.

336
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,578
And his wrath was bore

337
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,915
by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

338
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,167
When Sodom and Gomorrah
was destroyed,

339
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,752
that was Loki.

340
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,840
When the waters wiped out everything with
the exception of Noah and his menagerie,

341
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,676
that was Loki. And he
was good at what he did.

342
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,556
But one day he refused to
bear God's wrath any longer.

343
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,017
Why?
He listened to his friend,

344
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,270
a Grigori by the name
of Bartleby.

345
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,437
Grigori?

346
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,732
One of the choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

347
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,276
Guess what they do.

348
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,029
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt...

349
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,366
Ahh. The Tenth Plague.

350
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,179
Tell a person that you're the
Metatron, and they stare at you blankly.

351
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,329
Mention something out of
a Charlton Heston movie

352
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,623
and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

353
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,625
May I continue uninterrupted?

354
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,752
Once he's done with the firstborn,

355
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,507
Loki takes his friend Bartleby
out for a post-slaughter drink.

356
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,926
And over many rounds,

357
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:24,139
they get into this discussion about whether
or not murder in the name of God is okay.

358
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,557
And in the end,

359
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,603
Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position

360
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,980
and take one which
doesn't involve slaughter.

361
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,648
So.

362
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,485
Very inebriated,

363
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,196
Loki tells God he quits,

364
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,574
throws down his fiery sword,

365
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,618
and gives him the finger.

366
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,829
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward,

367
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,999
God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

368
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,584
Hence all the spitting.

369
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,086
So for their insolence,

370
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,089
God decreed that neither
Loki nor Bartleby

371
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,800
would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

372
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,677
Were they sent to hell?
Worse.

for the entire span
of human history.

375
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:11,102
And when the world ends, they'll have
to sit outside the gates for all eternity.

376
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,021
And this has what to do with me?

377
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,567
Someone has clued them in to
a loophole in Catholic dogma

378
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,278
that would allow them
to re-enter heaven.

379
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,031
So what? They beat the
system. Good for them.

380
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,033
It's not that simple.

381
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:29,579
If they get in, they will have
reversed God's decree.

382
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,917
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

384

Existence in all its form and splendour
functions solely on one principle:

385
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,845
God is infallible.

386
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,847
To prove him wrong

387
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,892
would undo reality
and everything that is.

388
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,853
Up would become down,
black would become white.

389
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,898
Existence would
become nothingness.

390
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,608
In essence,

391
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,153
if they're allowed to
enter that church,

392

they'll unmake the world.

393

If this is so major, why
are you talking to me?

394
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,913
Why doesn't God do
something about it?

395
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,917
He could. But he'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

405
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:42,235
he couldn't be with a wife who
couldn't bear children, where was God?

to get blinked out of being

408

a grudge against your creator.

409

So you lost the ability

But I can't make you.

they destroyed it.

among all his endeavours,

1386

don't even believe he exists!

1387

And in spite of it all,

1388
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:53,590
he has shown them
infinite fucking patience

1389

Very basic strategy.

Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

am I supposed to kill anybody?

Why me?

Out of all the people on the
god damn planet, why was I tapped?

1439
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,324
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1440
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,494
And one day you're told
you're God's only son,

1441
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,204
but more than that, you're God.

1442
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,572
How long do you think
it would take you to come to grips

1443
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:32,874
with something that huge?

1444
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,627
Maybe, say, hmm, 18 years?

1445
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:40,799
In the Bible, Jesus suddenly goes
from age 12 to 30. Twelve to 30.

1446
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,093
[RUFUS] Now, that's
some pretty bad storytelling.

1447
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,096
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1448

I'll tell you where.

1449
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,310
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1450
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,397
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy

1451
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,233
to cover up
the truth about Christ.

1452
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:01,986
Oh, bullshit.

1453
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,864
Any important material
about Christ would give people

1454
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,741
a better understanding of God.

1455
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,326
Why would they leave any of it out?

1456
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,829
Because it's all closely tied in
with his family.

1457
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,957
His mother and father.
His brothers and sisters.

1458
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:18,294
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1459
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:22,715
Mary gave birth to Christ without
knowing a man's touch. This is true.

1460
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,717
But she did have a husband.

1461
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,094
And do you really think

1462
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,513
he would've stayed
married to her for all those years

1463
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,181
if he wasn't getting laid?

1464
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:33,685
The nature of God and the virgin birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1465
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:38,022
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

It was an honour.

2163
01:58:30,812 --> 01:58:34,064
You did so well.

2164
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:41,280
I told you she was a woman.

2165
01:58:43,283 --> 01:58:45,576
She's not really a woman.

2166
01:58:45,744 --> 01:58:48,120
She's not really anything.

2167
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:50,372
She's something, all right.

2168
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:53,292
Crisis of faith over?

2169
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,878
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

2170
01:58:56,046 --> 01:58:58,297
Heh. When it rains, it pours.

2171
01:58:58,465 --> 01:59:00,674
Are you saying you believe?

2172
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:03,886
No. But I have a good idea.

2173
01:59:04,054 --> 01:59:05,638
Yes.

2174
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:08,390
Mm.

2175
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:11,268
The man was right about you.

2176
01:59:11,436 --> 01:59:14,438
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell him so.

2177
01:59:15,357 --> 01:59:17,233
And if you clean up your language,

2178
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,735
I just might put in
a good word for you too.

2179
01:59:20,403 --> 01:59:21,821
Thanks.

2180
01:59:23,365 --> 01:59:25,074
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

2185

You guys wanna
hear something sick?

2186
02:00:05,782 --> 02:00:08,617
I got half a stalk when she kissed me.
Jay!

2187
02:00:08,785 --> 02:00:11,120
I couldn't help it. The bitch was hot.

2188
02:00:11,288 --> 02:00:15,749
You can't talk to me that way any more.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

2189
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:17,376
You're pregnant?

[♪♪♪]

2191
02:00:19,045 --> 02:00:22,506
Yo, I heard pregnant women can
have sex into their third trimester.

2192
02:00:22,674 --> 02:00:24,008
I'll keep that in mind.
