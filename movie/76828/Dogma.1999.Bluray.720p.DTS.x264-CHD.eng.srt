1
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:10,034
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving force
behind atholicism WOW!, Cardinal Glick.

2
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:19,277
Thank you

3
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:21,287
Now we all know
how the majority...

4
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:23,619
and the media in this country...

5
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,954
view the Catholic church.

6
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:29,120
They think of us as a passe,
archaic institution.

7
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,427
People find the Bible obtuse...

8
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:33,989
even hokey.

9
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,160
Now, in an effort to disprove
all that...

10
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:39,967
the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

11
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,008
both offaith and of style.

12
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,141
For example, the crucifix.

13
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,840
While it has been a time-honored symbol
of our faith...

14
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:50,974
Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

15
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:52,643
this highly recognizable...

16
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,017
yet wholly depressing image...

17
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,283
of our Lord, crucified.

18
00:02:57,357 --> 00:03:00,724
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

19
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:02,659
He came to help us out.

20
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,426
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

21
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,264
that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring Sigil.

22
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:13,266
So, it is with great pleasure
that I presentyou with the first...

23
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,002
of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow!. campaign...

24
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:19,512
will unveil over the nextyear,
I giveyou...

25
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,807
"The Buddy Christ.""

26
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:33,684
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

27
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,160
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

28
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,628
But look at it.

29
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,529
Doesn't it pop?.

30
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,226
Buddy Christ.

31
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,426
Well, thereyou have it.

32
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,403
Let me get this straight.

33
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:49,067
You don't believe in God
because of Alice in Wonderland?.

34
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,167
No, Through the Looking Glass.

35
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,178
That poem,
""The Walrus and the Carpenter""...

36
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,476
that's an indictment
of organized religion.

37
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:57,574
The Walrus, with his girth
and his good nature...

38
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,676
he obviously represents either Buddha...

39
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:02,779
orwith his tusks,
the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

40
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:04,847
That takes care
ofyour Eastern religions.

41
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:07,655
Now, the Carpenter, which is
an obvious reference toJesus Christ...

42
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:11,357
who was raised a carpenter's son,
he represents the Western religions.

43
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:13,899
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?.

44
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,527
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

45
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:20,369
and then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

46
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,375
I don't know what that says toyou,
but to me it says...

47
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:27,209
that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

48
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,010
ensures the destruction
of one's inner-being.

49
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,176
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

50
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:35,085
by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

51
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:38,522
out offear ofsome
intangible parent figure...

52
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:41,584
who shakes a finger at us
from thousands ofyears ago...

53
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:45,563
and says, "" Do it--
Do it and I'll fuckin' spankyou!""

54
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:46,997
Oh,Jesus!

55
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:50,662
The wayyou put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

56
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,062
What have I been doing
with my life?.

57
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:57,533
- What am I?.
- Yeah, I know.

58
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,408
Listen, my advice toyou...

59
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,039
you take this money thatyou've
been collecting foryour parish...

60
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:05,312
go getyourself a nice dress,
fixyourself up.

61
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:08,616
Find some man-- find some woman--you
can connect with, even for a moment...

62
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:11,782
'cause that's really all life is,
Sister-- a series of moments.

63
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,860
Why don'tyou seizeyours?.

64
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:19,497
That a girl.

65
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,441
You know, here's what
I don't get aboutyou.

66
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,342
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

67
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,245
You've been in His presence.
He's spoken toyou personally.

68
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:38,546
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuckwith the clergy, man.

69
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:42,054
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

70
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:44,056
Here's what I don't get aboutyou.

71
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:46,888
Why doyou feel the need
to come to this place all the time?.

72
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,428
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

73
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:50,690
Look at them.

74
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:54,632
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

75
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:58,637
forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get offthe plane.

76
00:05:58,705 --> 00:05:59,967
See those two?.

77
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,339
What that guy doesn't know is that the
girl cheated on him while she was away.

78
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,344
- She did?.
- Twice.

79
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,573
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

80
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:10,582
'cause they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

81
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:12,913
I like that.

82
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:15,284
I wish they all could
feel that way more often.

83
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:18,518
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?.

84
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:21,026
You call me, you tell me
it's important.

85
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:24,552
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?.

86
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,690
We're going home.

87
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,030
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

88
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,971
Take it and quit leering at me. People
will think I just broke upwith you.

89
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:40,479
- You said we're going home, didn'tyou?.
- Read.

90
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:44,540
""Cardinal GlickCuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign.""

91
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:46,085
And?.

92
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,849
You have to keep reading.

93
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,050
""The rededication of
St. Michael's Church...""

94
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,525
...is the kickoffofa new campaign
which seeks to bring...

95
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,425
Catholicism into the mainstream.

96
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:59,021
With a papal sanction,
the archway entrance...

97
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,567
ofthe century-oldJersey shore
house ofworship...

98
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:04,035
will serve as a passageway
ofplenary indulgence--

99
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:07,437
a little-known Catholic belief offering
all that passes through its arches...

100
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:09,372
a morally clean slate.

101
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,605
For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

102
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:16,171
Al I I gotta do, I wal k through the arch
thi ng, and then I can go back home?.

103
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:19,741
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

104
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,447
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die?. I don't wanna die.

105
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:26,288
- You rather hang around here?.
- No. We don't know ifwe can die.

106
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:29,453
But what ifwe can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?.

107
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,326
What then, Hell?.
Fuck that.

108
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:33,332
It's impossible.
Ifwe cut off ourwings...

109
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,836
and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

110
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:39,371
Ifwe die with clean souls,
there's nowaythey can keep us out.

111
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,567
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

112
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:46,043
- Who sent the paper?.
- Who cares who sent the paper?.

113
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:49,206
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

114
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,216
He can't keep us out anymore.

115
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:53,218
Once we're back in,
it'll be forgive and forget.

116
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,379
But this thing,
this is Church law.

117
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:57,320
It's not Divine Mandate.

118
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,985
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:04,497
One ofthe last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:08,125
by the Son ofGod
before He left was...

121
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:11,398
- ""Whateveryou hold true on Earth--""
- "" I'll hold true in Heaven.""

122
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:14,531
It's dogmatic law. Ifthe Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

123
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:16,268
This thing has a papal sanction--

124
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:19,244
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

125
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:21,246
neveryielded positive results.

126
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:23,407
You can't be anal retentive
ifyou don't have an anus.

127
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:25,747
Outstanding work!

128
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,720
There's just one thing
I thinkwe gotta do before we leave.

129
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:30,915
This is gonna help us get back
on His good side.

130
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:32,151
What?.

131
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,092
Here. I've been dreaming about this
for fiveyears. Read that.

132
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:36,628
"" Mooby, the Golden Calf.

133
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,460
Creating an Empire
Out ofSimplicity."

134
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,432
I wanna hit 'em.

135
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:44,231
You really are
just a simple creature.

136
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:46,602
We finallyfind a way back
and you want to jeopardize that...

137
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:48,766
becauseyou've got a soft spot
for the good ol' days.

138
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:52,300
What betterway to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

139
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,869
thanks to you?.

140
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:57,007
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

141
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,984
Killing spree?.
I'm talking about DivineJustice here.

142
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:03,386
I'm talking about reigning down fire
and brimstone, punishing thewicked.

143
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:06,084
He's all about that.
I know He'd want this done.

144
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,855
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
sinceyou quit.

145
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:10,520
Doesn't that mean anything toyou?.

146
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:13,464
And besides, what ifyou're wrong,
likeyou always are?.

147
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:16,161
IfI'm wrong-- which I'm not--
it's not gonna matter.

148
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,500
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

149
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,404
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

150
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:25,171
Well, He does hate competition.
I will say that.

151
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,543
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

152
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,639
Where is this church
we have to go to?.

153
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:33,015
NewJersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

154
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:35,054
Last four days on Earth?.

155
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,487
Ifl had a dick,
I'd go get laid.

156
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,684
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?.

157
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,624
Let's kill people.

158
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,286
Oh, notyou.

159

The greater Illinois Chapter
ofthe Right to Life Foundation...

161
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,138
will be holding its
biannual softball game...

162
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,676
against the Cook County...

163
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:00,144
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2::00.

164
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,613
T oday's second col lection
wi I l be donated...

165
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:05,515
to the J ohn Doe J ersey Life Fund.

166
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,951
For those ofyou
who haven't been following the news...

167
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,114
an unidentified homeless man...

168
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,320
who was accosted and severely beaten
at the NewJersey shore last Tuesday...

169
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:18,524
Iies in critical, but stable condition
in one ofthat area's hospitals.

170
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:20,395
He lacks identification...

171
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:23,959
and police have had no luck tracking
down any possible family.

172
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:28,440
The archbishop ofthe Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

173
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,739
to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

174
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:34,541
asking that Catholics
all over the country...

175
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:37,742
join in this protest against euthanasia.

176
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,244
Well, now please rise
for the recession offaith.

177
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,785
We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty...

178
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,385
Maker of Heaven and Earth.

179
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:52,556
We believe inJesus Christ,
His onlySon, Our Lord--

180
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,498
Choose life!

181
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:59,026
You're gonna burn in Hell,
ya fuckin' baby killer!

182
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:00,902
Holy shit. It's the pope.

183
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,373
- Huh?.
- Where?.

184
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:03,773
What are you talking about?.

185
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,749
Jesus! You're a Catholic.
Can'tyou talk to them?.

186
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:18,950
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

187
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,892
At leastyou have an excuse. You're
Jewish. You don't know any better.

188
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:25,453
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

189
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:27,591
Where wereyou yesterday?.
We went to brunch.

190
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,032
I went to church.

191
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,036
That still kills me,
you and church.

192
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:34,631
If only they knewyourweekly tithing
came from a Planned Parenthood check.

193
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:37,141
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

194
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:42,040
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

195
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:45,346
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

196
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,852
I don't think I have any faith left.

197
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:52,057
Remember that seminary student
I tried to setyou up with?.

198
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:57,529
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have baby-sat for in high school.

199
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,963
The point is,
he told me something.

200
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:02,593
He said that faith
is like a glass ofwater.

201
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:05,638
When you'reyoung, the glass is little,
so it's easyto fill.

202
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:07,639
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

203
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:09,732
The same amount ofliquid
doesn't fill it anymore.

204
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,642
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

205
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:14,612
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?.

206
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,909
In moreways than one.

207
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:20,419
You need to get laid, Bethany Sloane.
You need a man, if only for 1 0 minutes.

208
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:23,319
It's been my experience that
the average male is never a man...

209
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,789
not even for ten minutes
in his entire life span.

210
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,793
That sounds militant. Areyou thinking
ofjoining the other side?.

211
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:30,761
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

212
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,027
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

213
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,034
I think God is dead.

214
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,536
The sign ofa true Catholic.

215
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:52,348
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

216
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:54,113
I'm from the EPA.

217
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:58,122
We're checking on possible
freon leaks.

218
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,523
Tell me,
doyou have air conditioning?.

219
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,288
Yes, we have central air.

220
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:03,989
In every room?.

221
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:05,860
Except the bathroom.
Why?.

222
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:07,957
Well, you do know
what that means, don'tyou?.

223
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,904
Move!

224
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,149
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

225
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,188
than central air.

226
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:37,055
Pick that up.

227
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:44,331
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

228
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:47,305
Now, ifl remember
the protocol correctly...

229
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:48,806
the powers...

230
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,276
will attempt to contact
the last scion.

231
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,506
I need you three...

232
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,708
to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

233
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,847
Go.

234
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:39,523
Behold the Metatron!

235
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:42,390
Herald ofthe Almighty
and voice ofthe one true God!

236
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:45,158
Behold the Metatron!

237
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:49,292
Herald ofthe Almighty
and voice ofthe one true God!

238
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:08,752
SweetJesus!
Doyou have to use the whole can?.

239
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:11,847
Who the fuck areyou and
what the fuck areyou doing in my room?.

240
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:14,757
I'm the one that's soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

241
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,795
Stupid fucking--

242
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:19,195
Get the fuck out ofhere,
now!

243
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,893
Oryou'll do what exactly?.

244
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,163
Hit me with that fish?.

245
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:32,034
Now,just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

246
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,705
Jesus wept!

247
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:36,544
Look at my suit.

248
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,448
Just take whateveryou want,
but don't kill or rape me.

249
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,923
Give over! I couldn't rapeyou
ifl wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

250
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:48,616
See?.

251
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,130
I'm as anatomically-impaired
as a Ken doll.

252
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:57,396
Makeyourselfuseful
and give me that towel.

253
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:00,870
You bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

254
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,636
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

255
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,301
What areyou?.

256
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:07,403
I'm pissed offis what I am.

257
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,541
Doyou drench everyone who comes in your
room with flame-retardant chemicals?.

258
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:14,484
No wonderyou're single.

259
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,716
Stand back.

260
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,059
As I was sayin'...

261
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:34,368
prior toyour fire-fighting episode...

262
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,905
I am the Metatron.

263
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:43,441
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell?.

264
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:46,651
You people.

265
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,916
Ifthere isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?.

266
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:53,952
I am a seraphim.

267
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:58,627
The highest choir ofangels.

268
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:01,866
You do knowwhat an angel is,
don'tyou?.

269
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:07,566
Metatron acts as the voice ofGod.

270
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,872
Any documented occasion when someyahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

271
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,673
they're speaking to me.

272
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,941
Or they're talking to themselves.

273
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,144
Why doesn't God speak for Himself?.

274
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,387
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

275
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:27,688
human beings have neither the aural,
nor the psychological capacity...

276
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,220
to withstand the awesome power
ofGod's true voice.

277
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:35,734
Wereyou to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

278
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,668
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

279
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:42,572
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?.

280
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:46,976
Aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?.

281
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,716
You want more proof?.

282
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:53,479
Fine.

283
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:54,679
How about tequila?.

284
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:05,930
-Where the hell are we?.
-Only placeyou can go for good tequila.

285
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:09,092
Dos tequilas, porfavor,
and an empty glass.

286
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,866
We're in Mexico?.

287
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:15,373
Actually, we're in a franchised
Mexican family eatery...

288
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,671
down the street
from your apartment, but...

289
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,608
it's impressive nonetheless.

290
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,343
You don't mind I lost the wings, doyou?.
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

291
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,214
What doyou want with me?.

292
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:32,690
I am to chargeyou
with a holy crusade.

293
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:36,057
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

294
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,494
Noah was a drunk.
Lookwhat he accomplished.

295
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:42,466
And no one's asking you to build an ark.
All you gotta do is go to NewJersey...

296
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:45,095
and visit a small church
on a very important day.

297
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:50,837
NewJersey?.

298
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:54,137
That doesn't sound like
much ofa crusade.

299
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:56,738
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

300
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,875
What's the fine print?.

301
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:02,884
Stop a couple of angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

302
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:05,150
Wait, wait, wait.
Repeat that.

303
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:08,489
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

304
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:11,724
and thus negating all existence.

305
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:14,095
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

306
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,997
You might want to clarify that.

307
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:21,434
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

308
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:23,634
And His wrath was bore...

309
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,940
by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

310
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:29,174
When Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed...

311
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:30,738
that was Loki.

312
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:34,877
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

313
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:37,684
that was Loki--
and he was good at what he did.

314
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:39,520
But one day...

315
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:42,561
he refused to bear God's wrath
any longer.

316
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:46,129
- Why?.
- He listened to his friend...

317
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,257
a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

318
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:49,460
Grigori?.

319
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:52,766
One ofthe choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

320
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,271
Guess what they do.

321
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,777
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt--

322
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,335
The Tenth Plague.

323
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:04,212
Tell a person thatyou're the Metatron
and they stare atyou blankly.

324
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:06,376
Mention something out of
a Charlton Heston movie...

325
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:08,613
and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

326
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:10,622
May I continue uninterrupted?.

327
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,783
Once he's done with the firstborn...

328
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:17,557
Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

329
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,962
And over many rounds...

330
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:22,159
they get into
this discussion about...

331
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,134
whether or not murder
in the name ofGod is okay.

332
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:25,568
And in the end...

333
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:29,574
Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

334
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,974
and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

335
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:33,636
So...

336
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,514
very inebriated...

337
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,245
Loki tells God he quits...

338
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,617
throws down his fiery sword...

339
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,622
and gives Him the finger.

340
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,887
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

341
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,020
God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

342
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:52,564
Hence all the spitting.

343
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,060
So, for their insolence...

344
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:58,126
God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

345
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:00,764
would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

346
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,705
- Were they sent to Hell?.
- Worse.

347
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:04,709
Wisconsin...

348
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:07,712
for the entire span
ofhuman history.

349
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,943
And when the world ends, they'll have to
sit outside the gates for all eternity.

350
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,007
And this has what to do with me?.

351
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:17,613
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

352
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,284
that would allow them
to reenter Heaven.

353
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,055
So what?. They beat the system.
Good for them.

354
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:25,029
It's not that simple.

355
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:29,193
Ifthey get in,
theywill have reversed God's decree.

356
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,805
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

357
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:39,001
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

358
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:42,741
function solely on one principle--

359
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:45,841
God is infallible.

360
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:47,852
To prove Him wrong...

361
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,889
would undo reality
and everything that is.

362
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:53,857
Upwould become down,
blackwould becomewhite.

363
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:56,895
Existencewould become nothingness.

364
00:21:56,962 --> 00:21:58,554
In essence...

365
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:02,100
ifthey're allowed to enter
that church...

366
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:06,928
they'll unmake the world.

367
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,907
Ifthis is so major,
why areyou talking to me?.

368
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:12,739
- Why doesn't God do something about it?.
- He could.

369
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:15,940
But He'd rather seeyou
take care ofthis one personally.

370
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:17,642
Why me?.

371
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:20,014
Because ofwhoyou are.

372
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:21,950
And who am I?.

373
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:24,148
The girl in the pj's!

374
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:27,920
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serveyour purpose.

375
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:30,018
I'm gonna have to pass.

376
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,090
I beg your pardon?.

377
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:36,601
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?.

378
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,296
When my husband decided...

379
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,804
he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear his children...

380
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:42,170
where was God?.

381
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,872
To Hell with Him.

382
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:50,177
Don't allow eons ofhistory and life
to get blinked out ofbeing...

383
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,547
just becauseyou've got a grudge
againstyour Creator.

384
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:55,052
Soyou lost the ability
to make life.

385
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,612
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

386
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:00,989
by acting like one
and protecting it--

387
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,994
saving it!

388
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:07,465
But I can't makeyou.

389
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:11,195
However, ifyou should decide
to stop being selfish...

390
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,761
and acceptyour responsibility...

391
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,739
you won't be alone.

392
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:17,173
You'll have support.

393
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:19,336
What?. More angels?.

394
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:21,003
Prophets.

395
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:25,974
In a manner ofspeaking.
Two of'em.

396
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:31,045
The one who speaks...

397
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:34,684
and he will, at great length,
whetheryou want him to or not...

398
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,785
will make mention ofhimself
as a prophet.

399
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,352
The other one...

400
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,094
well, he's the quiet type.

401
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,428
Look, I've gotta go.

402
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,833
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

403
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:50,469
What's He like?.

404
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,509
God?.

405
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,240
Lonely...

406
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:57,214
but funny.

407
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:59,444
He's got a great sense ofhumor.

408
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:01,452
Take sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

409
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,182
than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

410
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,190
Sex is a joke in Heaven?.

411
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:10,092
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

412
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,424
I'll seeya.

413
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:17,319
Snootch to the motherfucking nootch!

414
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,860
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

415
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,464
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?.

416
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:04,195
I know theywere just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pube-less asses!

417
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:12,476
I don't know what to say
or think, except--

418
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,512
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?.

419
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,811
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

420
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,784
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

421
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:23,378
I don't know who those kids were,
but theywould have kicked yours...

422
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:26,390
and Lunchbox's asses
ifl hadn't represented.

423
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,291
Thanks for being
out here so late.

424
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:31,556
Wait a minute.
Areyou protestors?.

425
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,622
You mean those dickheads with the signs
and pictures of dead babies?.

426
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,168
Shit no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

427
00:27:37,236 --> 00:27:39,204
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

428
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:41,262
But what areyou doing
hanging around?.

429
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,365
We're here to pick up chicks.

430
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:45,171
Excuse me?.

431
00:27:45,244 --> 00:27:48,407
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

432
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,244
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?.

433
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:54,244
Right.

434
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,117
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

435
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,089
- I think.
- Wait a second.

436
00:27:59,158 --> 00:28:01,752
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

437
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:02,919
What the shit is that?.

438
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:06,897
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

439
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:09,934
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

440
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:14,761
Now how about that shit?.
Fuck this town, man!

441
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,365
I'm goin' back toJersey
and startin' up the business again.

442
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:21,276
I can kick the shit out ofkids
in Red Bank and make myselfa profit.

443
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:23,940
Prophets. Two of'em.

444
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:27,713
- You know what I'm sayin', Silent Bob?.
- You gotta be kidding me.

445
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:30,482
We call this piece ""The Fecalator.""

446
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:33,184
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

447
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:34,691
Try it on.

448
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:40,061
It's a lot more compact than the flaming
sword, but not nearly as impressive.

449
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:43,431
It doesn't have that
""Wrath ofthe Almighty"" edge to it.

450
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:47,632
How am I supposed to strike fear into
hearts ofthe wicked with this thing?.

451
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:48,798
Look at this.

452
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:53,573
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

453
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:56,637
Easy foryou to say.
You get offlight in a razing.

454
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:58,910
You got to stand there and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

455
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:00,918
I had to do all the work.

456
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:04,251
What work did you do?.
You lit a few fires.

457
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:06,917
I rained down sulfur.
There's a subtle difference.

458
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,721
Okay, I'm sure.

459
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:12,855
Fuckyou. Any moron with a pack
of matches can set a fire.

460
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,865
Raining down sulfur
is like an endurance trial.

461
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,595
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can engage in...

462
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:19,227
next to soccer.

463
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:22,437
I'll take this one.

464
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:39,345
So, what's up?. You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or areyou gonna do us both?.

465
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:41,824
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

466
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:43,918
You're a man of principle.

467
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:47,625
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I askwhat broughtyou here?.

468
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,190
Some fuck named John Hughes.

469
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:51,964
Sixteen Candles John Hughes?.

470
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:56,240
You know that guy too?.
That fuckin' guy.

471
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:59,072
He made this flick Sixteen Candles.
Not bad.

472
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:01,374
There's tits in it, but no bush.

473
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:04,074
But Ebert over here don't give
a shit about that kind ofthing...

474
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:06,549
because he's like in love
with this John Hughes guy.

475
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,779
He goes out and rents
every one ofhis movies.

476
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:13,314
Fuckin' Breakfast Club, where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

477
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:17,158
Fuckin' WeirdScience, where this babe
wants to undress and get down...

478
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:20,426
but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

479
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:24,663
And then Prettyin Pink, which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

480
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:28,103
because when the redhead hooks up
with her dream guy...

481
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:31,700
he starts sobbin' like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

482
00:30:31,777 --> 00:30:35,008
And there's nothing worse
than watchin' a fuckin' fat man weep.

483
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,048
What exactly broughtyou
to Illinois?.

484
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:41,017
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

485
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:45,216
where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes arewhiny pussies.

486
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,259
Except forJudd Nelson.
Hewas fuckin' harsh.

487
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:49,624
But best ofall...

488
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:51,822
there was no one dealin', man.

489
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:54,365
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

490
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:56,731
ifwe were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

491
00:30:56,802 --> 00:30:59,965
Sowe collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

492
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,132
Butyou know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?.

493
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:06,109
There is no Shermer, Illinois.

494
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:08,146
Movies are fuckin' bullshit.

495
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:12,206
- When areyou going back to NewJersey?.
- This broad asks a lot of questions.

496
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:15,447
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

497
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,385
Yeah. Soyou do anal?.

498
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:19,981
Is it true that chicks fart
ifyou blast them in the ass?.

499
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:21,958
I didn't askyou out for sex.

500
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:23,961
I'll take head.

501
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:29,958
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this.

502
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:34,471
I think I should gowith you.

503
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:37,474
Like steady?.
You wanna be my girlfriend?.

504
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,545
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

505
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:44,446
No. I wanna go with you
to NewJersey.

506
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:45,608
Really?.

507
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,777
You're going to lead me somewhere.

508
00:31:47,853 --> 00:31:49,514
Me lead you?.

509
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:52,557
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am halfthe time.

510
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:55,616
Ifwe're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?.

511
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:59,755
Someone told me I'd meetyou and you'd
take me someplace I was supposed to go.

512
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:01,822
What the hell areyou babbling about?.

513
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,596
We saved your ass from
some angry fuckin' dwarves...

514
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:08,435
and now we're supposed to takeyou
somewhere as ifwe know where it is?.

515
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,138
Doyou believe in God?.

516
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:16,877
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front ofthat place...

517
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:18,882
and we gotta get the oneJesus freak?.

518
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,212
- Let's get the fuck out ofhere.
- Wait.

519
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:21,980
- I'll scream rape.
- I can payyou.

520
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,354
Pay?.

521
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:28,993
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

522
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,156
You were going toJersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

523
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:36,723
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

524
00:32:36,802 --> 00:32:39,202
and we're in that fucked-up bar!

525
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:40,795
What about sex?.

526
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:42,203
No sex.

527
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:48,144
Let's saywe're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

528
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:51,705
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?.

529
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,808
In that highly unlikely situation?.

530
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:58,383
Yeah, sure.

531
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,517
She's a slut.

532
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:05,421
All right.

533
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:08,999
But I get to drive.

534
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:20,577
What gear areyou in?.

535
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:21,839
Gear?.

536
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:33,383
What do I know about shiftin'?.

537
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:38,656
Like I ever drove before.

538
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:45,400
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

539
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,869
NewJersey.

540
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:49,065
Maybeyou're wrong
about this slaughter thing.

541
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,270
How can you be sure what incurs the
Lord's wrath these days?. Times change.

542
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:57,076
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a Hell-worthy trespass.

543
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:59,616
The major sins never change.

544
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:05,785
Besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker from a mile away.

545
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,722
Bet on it.

546
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,522
This from the guywho still owes me
ten bucks over that bet...

547
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:13,792
about which was gonna be the bigger
movie-- ET or Krush Groove.

548
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:16,959
Fuckyou, man,
'cause time's gonna tell on that one.

549
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:24,100
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?.

550
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,733
Insinuating, no.

551
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,370
Flat-out telling you.

552
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:33,476
Right there.
There's one.

553
00:34:33,552 --> 00:34:35,952
So?. They're kissing.

554
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:36,988
Adultery.

555
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:39,353
- Adultery?.
- Adultery.

556
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:41,392
You are just a simple creature.

557
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,053
- Am I right?.
- I happen to know the truth.

558
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,155
I'm not gonna tell you. I want to see
how boned up on the jobyou are.

559
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:50,030
- What's your proof?.
- He's wearing a wedding band.

560
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:52,797
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?.

561
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:55,169
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

562
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,004
Okay. It's a good thing
you were never...

563
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:01,068
the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

564
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:05,014
"" No married man kisses
his wife like that""?. Areyou stoned?.

565
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,175
Excuse me.

566
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:10,444
Areyou married?.

567
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,319
Why?.

568
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,857
I'm just curious.

569
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:16,223
What doyou think?.

570
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:27,263
- What?.
- To her?.

571
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:29,398
- What?.
- Areyou married to her?.

572
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:32,910
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

573
00:35:32,978 --> 00:35:34,809
Why?.

574
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,618
Whose house

575
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:24,161
Run's house

576
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:26,857
I said, whose house

577
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:28,865
Run's house

578
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,060
Whose house
Say what

579
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:33,468
Run's house
Say what

580
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,369
Martin

581
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,270
She's fuckin' pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

582
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:44,338
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

583
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,611
Let me know how she is.

584
00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:49,552
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?.

585
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:52,652
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

586
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:55,989
but being that I've decided to go home,
and not to NewJersey...

587
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:58,552
sorry for the inconvenience
and good-bye.

588
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,797
You're breaking up with us?.

589
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,466
Who the hell doyou think
you are, lady?.

590
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:07,528
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

591
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:10,904
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

592
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:14,103
Guys like us just don't fall out
ofthe fuckin' sky.

593
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:25,752
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out ofthe sky.

594
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:41,433
No heartbeat.

595
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:44,100
Think someone threw him out ofa plane
with a message written on him...

596
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:45,699
Iike in ConAir?.

597
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:48,473
- Did you ever see that flick?.
- Oh, did that suck!

598
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:51,208
- ConAir?. Con Shit.
- Kill it!

599
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:54,376
- Sounds familiar.
-Jesus, areyou okay?.

600
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,545
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

601
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:58,885
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!.

602
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:01,824
What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

603
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:05,989
So ifyou don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yankyour sac offlike a paper towel.

604
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:08,532
Speaking ofwhich,
you're awfully nude.

605
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,364
- Rufus, is it?.
- Yes, Rufus it is.

606
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:15,896
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand?.

607
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:19,273
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find my own threads?.

608
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:23,410
Dude, he fell out ofthin air.

609
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:27,882
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside ofyour armor.

610
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:30,284
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

611
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,684
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

612
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:36,226
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

613
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:39,263
the impact with which you hit
the asphalt would have liquefied you.

614
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,093
Death is a worry ofthe living.

615
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:44,658
The dead, like myself, onlyworry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

616
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,603
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

617
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:48,696
I died.

618
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:51,003
Christ told me the secret
to the resurrection once.

619
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,670
We were at this wedding in Caanan.
I got drunk and forgot it.

620
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:56,509
Wait, wait, wait.

621
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,481
Christ?.

622
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,643
You knew Christ?.

623
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,777
Knew him?.
Shit, nigga owes me 1 2 bucks.

624
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:04,685
Let me guess.

625
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:07,281
- You're another angel?.
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

626
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,191
I'm a man,just likeyou and him.
Well, maybe not him.

627
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:11,888
At least I was a man.

628
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:15,091
Been dead nearly 2,000 years.
Here, check this out.

629
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:19,431
Nowonder he sawJesus.
Homey's rockin' the ganj.

630
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:21,699
It's not a joint.

631
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:24,071
I can't read this.

632
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:29,239
It's Aramaic. It says,
"" Rufus, seeyou in twoyears.Jesus.""

633
00:39:29,314 --> 00:39:32,442
Freaked me out because He basically
told me when my numberwas up.

634
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:35,350
Took all the flavor out ofthe
remaining years. We gotta get moving.

635
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,083
Let's saywe continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit. Come on.

636
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:41,717
I'm starvin'.
Back off, Kato.

637
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:43,055
Wait a second!

638
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:46,854
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out ofthe sky...

639
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,990
and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

640
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:52,059
I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

641
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:55,572
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where the hell you came from.

642
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,574
Me?. I came from Heaven.

643
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,166
Now let's start walkin'.

644
00:39:59,244 --> 00:40:02,077
Walk?. Fuckyou! Doyou know
how farwe are from anywheres?.

645
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:06,378
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

646
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:08,715
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?.

647
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,588
What the hell's an apostle?.

648
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:40,614
Let me get this straight.

649
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,949
She's already met the prophets...

650
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:45,148
and the apostle's with them?.

651
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:50,356
I think that our best course
of action...

652
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:53,955
is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

653
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:58,628
And being that I can't even
trustyou enough to kill a woman...

654
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:02,899
well, I'm left with no choice...

655
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:07,035
but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

656
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:12,541
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

657
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:18,087
I appreciate the loan, brother.
You can have that back.

658
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:21,523
Man, I rememberwhen all we used to have
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

659
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:24,060
- What doyou call this shit?.
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

660
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:27,291
Now, how 'boutyou start explaining
some things, like for starters...

661
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:28,798
how did you know
where to find us?.

662
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:31,130
Doyou know what the dead do
with most oftheir time?.

663
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:34,069
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

664
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:35,765
I can't wait to die.

665
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,671
And why areyou watching me?.

666
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:40,336
Becauseyou're the one who's gonna
help me get some changes made...

667
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:42,106
in that book
you put so much stock in.

668
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,512
- Hustler?.
- The Bible!

669
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:47,915
- What's your beefwith the Bible?.
- For starters, I'm not in it.

670
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:50,580
Neither are any of us, butyou
don't hear us bitchin' and moanin'.

671
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:54,113
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 1 3th Apostle.

672
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,756
I've gone to church mywhole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 1 3th Apostle.

673
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,595
Butyou heard of
the other 1 2 Apostles.

674
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:06,296
Theywere all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

675
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:08,896
And why is that?.
'Cause I'm a black man.

676
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,032
Butyou know what?.
That's just my pet peeve.

677
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:15,569
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing your faith on.

678
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:19,207
- What's that?.
-Jesus wasn't white.Jesus was black.

679
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:20,443
I don't buy it.

680
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:24,716
Ifthat's true, why did He get
written about and you were left out?.

681
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:27,019
Well, He is the Son ofGod.

682
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:29,252
Kind ofhard to have
a New Testament without him.

683
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:32,125
Soyou fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

684
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:35,825
Leaving me out is okay 'causeyou
still got 1 2 white boys to choose from.

685
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,529
- Areyou gonna listen to this shit?.
- That's what people of Antioch said...

686
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:41,435
right before they stoned my ass.

687
00:42:41,506 --> 00:42:42,666
You were martyred?.

688
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,674
That's one way of puttin' it.

689
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:47,768
Anotherway is to say I was bludgeoned
to shit by big fucking rocks.

690
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:50,643
White folks onlywanna hear
the good shit--

691
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:53,013
Iife eternal,
a place in God's Heaven.

692
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:55,644
But as soon as you hear
thatyou're gettin' this good shit...

693
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,415
from a blackJesus, ya freak.

694
00:42:57,488 --> 00:42:59,752
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

695
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:04,488
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't beyour savior.

696
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:05,893
You gonna eat that hash brown?.

697
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:08,898
So, you went to Heaven?.

698
00:43:08,966 --> 00:43:12,231
Damn right I went to Heaven!
That's the least He could do.

699
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:15,739
In the threeyears I followed His ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?.

700
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:18,970
Hell no.
And I was in my prime.

701
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:21,511
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

702
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:24,173
not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

703
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:26,182
She had a thing for dark meat,
ifyou follow me.

704
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,481
Maybe this is just me talking,
but ifl were in Heaven...

705
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:32,489
I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as they got the message right.

706
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:34,684
The message is what counts.

707
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:38,559
But folks who build theirfaith
on that message should be colorblind.

708
00:43:38,629 --> 00:43:41,689
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

709
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:43,700
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

710
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:47,499
That's why I'm gonna helpyou stop those
angels from gettin' into that church...

711
00:43:47,572 --> 00:43:50,166
in exchange foryou helping me
with my campaign.

712
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,005
How doyou know about that,
the angels?.

713
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:56,205
- Isn't much I don't know aboutyou.
- I find that hard to believe.

714
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,580
When you were five, you let a kid
from next door piss on your hand.

715
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:04,052
You did that shit?.
You're nasty.

716
00:44:04,122 --> 00:44:06,647
I never told anybody about that.

717
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:08,419
Neither did he.

718
00:44:08,493 --> 00:44:11,326
Two years later,
that kid died ofleukemia.

719
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:14,091
His name was Brian Johnson.

720
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:16,292
Your exploits,
no matter how inane...

721
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:18,426
are well documented in Heaven.

722
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:20,334
Probably Hell too.

723
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:27,170
Where areyou going?.

724
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:29,076
Tell me somethin' about me.

725
00:44:29,147 --> 00:44:32,139
You masturbate more than anyone
on the planet.

726
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:35,083
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

727
00:44:35,153 --> 00:44:37,621
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

728
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:43,893
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry ifl scared you.

729
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:50,934
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

730
00:44:51,002 --> 00:44:53,630
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
God even existed.

731
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:57,196
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

732
00:44:57,275 --> 00:45:01,143
Let me letyou in
on a little inside info.

733
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:05,945
God hates it when
it's referred to as ""mythology.""

734
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:11,614
Oh, well, then let's ask the ""prophets""
what we should call it instead.

735
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,386
Where did those two assholes go?.

736
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:36,971
What areyou doing?.

737
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:39,073
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

738
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,141
- What?.
- Long story. Forget it.

739
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:43,551
We gotta get movin'.
How can we get toJersey?.

740
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:45,646
We'll take the train.
I'll call for reservations.

741
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,449
I thought she looked familiar.

742
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:47,143
- Who?.
- Serendipity.

743
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:01,556
Morning, shoppers.

744
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:03,395
Good morning.

745
00:47:04,302 --> 00:47:06,736
- Has anyone seen the overnights?.
- No, sir.

746
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:09,664
We creamed 'em.

747
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:15,005
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me--

748
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:19,482
Do I smell onions?.

749
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:27,288
Excuse me.

750
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:33,186
May I askwhatyou're doing
in my boardroom?.

751
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:37,066
You may proceed, mon ami.

752
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:42,699
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

753
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:45,708
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

754
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,368
Oh, come on!

755
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:52,615
Relax. I'm doing it.

756
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:56,909
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

757
00:47:56,987 --> 00:48:01,390
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher in 1 989.

758
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:04,223
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1 991.

759
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:08,061
Broadcast nationally
as the "" Mooby Fun-Time Hour.""

760
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:12,626
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

761
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:16,696
1 6 records,
8 prime-time specials...

762
00:48:16,774 --> 00:48:21,370
and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

763
00:48:21,445 --> 00:48:25,404
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

764
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:28,043
dubbed "" MoobyWorld.""

765
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:30,451
Did I miss anything?.

766
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:32,284
You forgot Mooby Magazine.

767
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:33,789
Damn it!

768
00:48:33,858 --> 00:48:35,587
Is there a point to this?.

769
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:39,425
You and your board are idolaters.

770
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:44,332
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

771
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,028
That's you.

772
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,468
Do you know much about voodoo?.

773
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:56,242
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine offaith to speak of.

774
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:59,043
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

775
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:01,107
the most well-known ofwhich...

776
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:02,709
is the voodoo doll.

777
00:49:02,787 --> 00:49:04,254
You see...

778
00:49:12,596 --> 00:49:15,622
a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

779
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:17,826
to various pokes and prods.

780
00:49:17,902 --> 00:49:22,032
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

781
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:23,664
Call security, now!

782
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:31,079
All lines are currently down.

783
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:33,548
- I'm gonna have to apologize--
- Would you knock it off?.

784
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:36,085
You're doing it again.
Stop. What did we talk about?.

785
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:40,588
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

786
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:42,626
which draws worship
from the Lord.

787
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,991
You have broken
the First Commandment.

788
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:48,054
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one ofyou...

789
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:50,896
passes for a decent human being.

790
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:55,405
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

791
00:49:55,473 --> 00:49:57,407
Likeyou, Mr. Burton.

792
00:49:57,475 --> 00:50:00,967
Lastyear, you cheated on yourwife
of 1 7 years 8 times.

793
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:03,275
You even had sex
with her best friend...

794
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:07,681
whileyou were supposed to be home
watching the kids.

795
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:11,243
In the bed thatyou
and yourwife share, no less.

796
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:12,448
Mr. Newman.

797
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:15,253
You gotyour girlfriend drunk
at lastyear's Christmas party...

798
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,624
and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

799
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:20,220
to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

800
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:22,925
just soyou could break up
with her guilt-free...

801
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,366
when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

802
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:29,637
She killed herself
three months later.

803
00:50:29,707 --> 00:50:32,642
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

804
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,644
Very compassionate.

805
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:37,806
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

806
00:50:37,882 --> 00:50:41,215
and used the profits
from the sale ofher home...

807
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:45,119
to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

808
00:50:45,189 --> 00:50:46,884
Heavens.

809
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:49,721
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

810
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:53,456
to have sex
with an eleven-year-old boy.

811
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:56,591
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

812
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:59,431
from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

813
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:01,903
because it was-- survey says--

814
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:05,239
Iess costly.

815
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:08,301
You, on the other hand...

816
00:51:08,379 --> 00:51:10,643
are an innocent.

817
00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:12,579
You lead a good life.

818
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:13,742
Good foryou.

819
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:17,712
But you, Mr. Whitland...

820
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:19,756
you have more skeletons
in your closet...

821
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:21,757
than this assembled party.

822
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:24,521
I cannot even mention them aloud.

823
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:31,994
You're his father,
you sick fuck!

824
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:36,664
- Good.
- Not bad, man.

825
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,674
That's great work.
Very good.

826
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:41,536
Well...

827
00:51:42,713 --> 00:51:44,874
alone at last.

828
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:47,474
With the exception of Miss Pryce here...

829
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:51,351
there isn't a decent human being
amongstyou.

830
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:53,185
Not one.

831
00:51:53,257 --> 00:51:56,852
Doyou know what makes
a human being decent?.

832
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:58,189
Fear.

833
00:51:58,262 --> 00:52:00,355
And therein lies the problem.

834
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:03,366
None ofyou has anything
left to fear anymore.

835
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:06,892
You rest comfortably in seats
ofinscrutable power...

836
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:10,202
hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

837
00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:13,539
Iives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

838
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:17,213
But not from God.

839
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:24,312
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

840
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:30,052
Man, it really looks
just likeyou, doesn't it?.

841
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:33,893
Look, ifl believed enough in this...

842
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:35,556
I wonder--

843
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:55,080
Come on.
I don't believe in voodoo.

844
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,382
Voodoo.

845
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:11,360
But I do believe in this.

846
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:13,835
Don't run! Don't run!

847
00:53:13,904 --> 00:53:16,702
Fakes! Fakes!
All ofyou, fakes!

848
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:21,440
"" But I do believe in this.""

849
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:22,945
What does that mean?.

850
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:24,480
And one to grow on.

851
00:53:30,554 --> 00:53:31,646
Gum?.

852
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,584
Go on. It's okay.

853
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:37,718
You've done nothing wrong.

854
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:40,889
These guys were fakes.

855
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:43,296
You're a pure soul.

856
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:47,496
Butyou didn't say ""God bless you""
when I sneezed.

857
00:53:48,572 --> 00:53:50,005
Loki!

858
00:53:52,076 --> 00:53:53,509
You're getting offlight.

859
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:55,602
- Loki!
- I know. I'm comin'.

860
00:53:59,616 --> 00:54:01,049
You're so lucky.

861
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:08,289
I forgotyou were down here.
How long now?.

862
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:09,791
Threeyears this August.

863
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,523
Let me guess-- the 1 4th Apostle, left
out ofthe Bible because she's a woman?.

864
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:14,825
This girl's no woman.

865
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:17,924
Oh. Those weren't tits
I sawJay cozying up to?.

866
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:19,730
What, these?.

867
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:24,001
You should know better than anyone here
that tits don't make a woman.

868
00:54:24,074 --> 00:54:26,474
Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

869
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:30,070
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things--

870
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:31,842
her legs.

871
00:54:31,915 --> 00:54:34,349
But as you can see...

872
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:36,181
I lack definition.

873
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:39,984
Hey, they're gettin' a free show!
Let me see that shit!

874
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:43,083
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

875
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,822
How doyou--
How does she know Metatron?.

876
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:47,887
This is the last scion.

877
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,563
You're kidding.

878
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:53,296
Wow.

879
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,394
I'm confused.

880
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:58,567
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

881
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:02,339
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

882
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:06,178
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

883
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,808
I'm a muse, stupid.

884
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:11,480
I can't take much more ofthis.

885
00:55:11,555 --> 00:55:13,250
Soyou, what, inspire people?.

886
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:16,053
What just went down
with your friends over there--

887
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:19,027
It doesn't really take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty theirwallets.

888
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:21,087
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

889
00:55:21,165 --> 00:55:26,660
For example, I'm responsible for 1 9 of
the 20 top-grossing films ofall time.

890
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:29,331
- Nineteen?.
- Yeah.

891
00:55:29,406 --> 00:55:32,341
The one about the kid
by himselfin his house...

892
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:35,435
burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off--

893
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:37,776
I had nothing to do
with that one.

894
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:42,182
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.

895
00:56:00,504 --> 00:56:02,904
What areyou doing stripping?.

896
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:04,406
Rememberwhy I left?.

897
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:07,910
Becauseyou were tired of getting
none ofthe credit foryour ideas.

898
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:11,141
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

899
00:56:11,215 --> 00:56:15,117
I gave my two weeks notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

900
00:56:15,185 --> 00:56:18,245
and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

901
00:56:18,322 --> 00:56:19,880
So what happened?.

902
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:22,716
Writer's block.

903
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:25,660
Can you believe it?.
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

904
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:29,756
I can inspire anyone I meet and give out
a zillion and nine ideas a second...

905
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,767
but I can't keep any for myself.

906
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,770
Her quirky sense ofhumor.

907
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,103
- Whose?.
- God's.

908
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:41,110
- You're saying God's a woman?.
- Was there ever a doubt in your mind?.

909
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:42,975
He's always referred to as "" Him.""

910
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:44,877
That's not how I wrote it.

911
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:46,882
But one ofthe drawbacks
to being intangible...

912
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,680
is thatyou have no say
in the editorial process.

913
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:52,813
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

914
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,415
and all the penholders were men.

915
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:59,428
So She became a He.
Doesn't stop with God either.

916
00:56:59,496 --> 00:57:01,555
The whole book's gender-biased.

917
00:57:01,632 --> 00:57:03,862
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

918
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:06,129
A woman cuts Samson coif of power.

919
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:09,604
A woman asks for the head
ofJohn the Baptist.

920
00:57:09,673 --> 00:57:11,140
Read that book again.

921
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:14,336
Women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the Egyptians and Romans combined.

922
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:15,673
It stinks.

923
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,815
Why is the last scion here?.

924
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:26,856
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

925
00:57:26,924 --> 00:57:30,121
- Not the plenary indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?.

926
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:33,128
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

927
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:35,130
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

928
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:37,723
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?.

929
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:41,362
I have issues with anyone who treats God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

930
00:57:41,438 --> 00:57:42,803
Iike some Catholics.

931
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:45,842
You people don't celebrateyour faith,
you mourn it.

932
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:50,141
-Ifwe're wrong, what religion is right?.
-It's not about who's right orwrong.

933
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:52,147
No denomination's nailed ityet...

934
00:57:52,215 --> 00:57:54,843
because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

935
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:59,855
that it doesn't matterwhatyou have
faith in,just thatyou have faith.

936
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:04,360
Your hearts are in the right place,
butyour brains gotta wake up.

937
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:09,323
They made me and Silent Bob
part ofthe gang.

938
00:58:15,238 --> 00:58:17,172
Who fuckin' farted?.

939
00:58:18,675 --> 00:58:21,906
Not born.
Shit into existence.

940
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:28,182
Sweet Christ,
somebodywants you bad!

941
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:30,742
- What is that thing?.
- An excremental.

942
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:33,085
- The Golgothan.
- A what?.

943
00:58:33,156 --> 00:58:34,555
A shit demon!

944
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:38,287
No man ofwoman born!

945
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:42,225
- Friend ofyours?.
- Is this smelly fuckwith us?.

946
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:43,926
It came for Bethany!

947
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:46,936
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thang!

948
00:58:47,004 --> 00:58:49,472
I knew I's gonna
whack somebody today!

949
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:51,473
Getyour fuckin' hand back.

950
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:52,769
Represent!

951
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:56,578
Go! Go! Go!

952
00:59:17,901 --> 00:59:20,335
Looks like we're in charge
ofthe gang now.

953
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:23,229
Over the bar!

954
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:36,152
- Where did that thing come from?.
- Ever heard ofGolgotha?.

955
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:38,244
The hill where Christ
was crucified.

956
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:41,085
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

957
00:59:41,158 --> 00:59:44,685
Christ excluded, theywere criminals--
killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

958
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:47,889
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

959
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:50,489
spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

960
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:53,434
the result ofwhich
is that walking pile of crap--

961
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:56,597
the Golgothan shit demon,
Hell's chiefassassin.

962
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:58,470
It's here foryou, girlie.

963
01:00:03,046 --> 01:00:05,276
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

964
01:00:38,148 --> 01:00:40,412
- Hey, man.
- How?.

965
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,180
"" Knocks strong odors out.""

966
01:00:44,254 --> 01:00:47,189
- Way to go, biggie.
- Whywould you ever carry this?.

967
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:50,987
What?.

968
01:00:51,061 --> 01:00:52,995
Whoever sent this might send more.

969
01:00:53,063 --> 01:00:57,022
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

970
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,660
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

971
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:02,500
Ifhe tells me something,
I'll letyou know.

972
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:06,105
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to NewJersey, please.

973
01:01:06,176 --> 01:01:07,871
Jersey's sold out, sir.

974
01:01:07,944 --> 01:01:10,538
- What?.
- There's one at the same time tomorrow.

975
01:01:10,614 --> 01:01:14,550
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power ofthe Garden State.

976
01:01:14,618 --> 01:01:16,950
Show up two hours in advance.

977
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:20,655
Nice.

978
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:23,659
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

979
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:27,857
what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

980
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:29,592
Bus, schmuss.

981
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:34,262
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?.

982
01:01:34,337 --> 01:01:36,771
- You mean fly?.
- We got wings, right?.

983
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,432
Fuck, let's use 'em!

984
01:01:38,508 --> 01:01:40,942
I wouldn't suggest that.

985
01:01:42,345 --> 01:01:44,176
You see, kids...

986
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:47,683
you wouldn't want to look like
a couple offairies, now, would you?.

987
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:55,416
How'd you get out of Hell?.

988
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:57,756
I told them I was coming up
on a routine possession.

989
01:01:57,827 --> 01:02:01,058
I don't have much time. Ifthey figure
out my ruse, they'll come after me.

990
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:04,862
-What's with bringing us in here?.
-You two are inches from getting caught.

991
01:02:04,935 --> 01:02:08,427
Going around killing people,
about to uncaseyourwings.

992
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:10,439
Don'tyou know what's going on?.

993
01:02:10,507 --> 01:02:12,441
Well, we're going home.

994
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:16,969
Really. Areyou so clueless as to think
you can justwaltz back into Heaven?.

995
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:19,607
- Why not?.
- Everybody is looking foryou.

996
01:02:19,683 --> 01:02:22,618
Both sides.
Above and below.

997
01:02:22,686 --> 01:02:24,984
Orders are to terminateyou
on sight.

998
01:02:25,055 --> 01:02:26,454
- Really?.
- Why?.

999
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:28,684
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

1000
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:32,688
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1001
01:02:32,762 --> 01:02:36,027
and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you assholes might make him look bad...

1002
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:38,033
by succeeding
where he's failed so many times.

1003
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:41,195
- So they're just gonna kill us?.
- They're gonna try.

1004
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:44,206
That's whyyou have to travel
incognito.

1005
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:47,334
Tone down your behavior.
Stay offtheir respective radars.

1006
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,344
Quit killing people.
That's high profile.

1007
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:52,313
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe theywanna kill us.

1008
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:54,316
Oh, believe it, boys.

1009
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:57,816
They've even got the last scion
looking foryou.

1010
01:02:57,887 --> 01:02:59,650
- Really?.
- You're kidding.

1011
01:02:59,723 --> 01:03:02,715
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot ofsides.

1012
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:04,726
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1013
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:08,059
In the meantime, I suggestyou find
an alternate mode oftransportation.

1014
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:10,190
Ifanything else comes up,
I'll contactyou.

1015
01:03:10,267 --> 01:03:13,464
Thankyou, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1016
01:03:13,536 --> 01:03:16,471
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1017
01:03:16,539 --> 01:03:20,202
And remember, incognito.

1018
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:27,242
Howyou coping, kid?.

1019
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:29,012
It's weird.

1020
01:03:29,085 --> 01:03:31,679
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1021
01:03:31,755 --> 01:03:35,020
something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1022
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:37,651
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1023
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,389
You sound like the Man.

1024
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:41,862
What's he like?.

1025
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:44,491
He likes to listen to people talk.

1026
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:48,003
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1027
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:50,437
Wheneverwe were going on
about unimportant shit...

1028
01:03:50,507 --> 01:03:52,702
he always had a smile
on his face.

1029
01:03:52,776 --> 01:03:54,835
His only real beefwith mankind...

1030
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:58,176
is the shit that gets carried out
in His name.

1031
01:03:58,248 --> 01:04:01,649
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1032
01:04:01,718 --> 01:04:05,381
The big one, though,
is the factioning ofall the religions.

1033
01:04:05,455 --> 01:04:07,389
He said mankind
got it all wrong...

1034
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:10,949
bytaking a good idea
and building a beliefstructure on it.

1035
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:13,689
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?.

1036
01:04:13,763 --> 01:04:15,856
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1037
01:04:15,932 --> 01:04:19,060
You can change an idea.
Changing a beliefis trickier.

1038
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:21,626
People die for it.
People kill for it.

1039
01:04:21,705 --> 01:04:24,139
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1040
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:29,372
because ofthe Catholic beliefstructure
regarding this plenary indulgence shit.

1041
01:04:29,446 --> 01:04:31,710
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1042
01:04:31,781 --> 01:04:33,715
are exploiting that belief...

1043
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:35,250
and ifthey're successful...

1044
01:04:35,318 --> 01:04:39,516
you, me, all ofthis
ends in a heartbeat.

1045
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:41,580
All over a belief.

1046
01:04:43,827 --> 01:04:47,786
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How aboutyou?.

1047
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:50,958
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1048
01:04:51,034 --> 01:04:54,367
and he went flying through the air,
fuckin' crashed through thewall.

1049
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:55,870
Itwas fucked up.

1050
01:04:55,939 --> 01:04:58,874
You two aren't getting into
anytrouble, areyou?.

1051
01:04:58,942 --> 01:05:02,207
We'rejust about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1052
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:05,509
who just got on at the last stop--
Larry and Barry.

1053
01:05:07,117 --> 01:05:09,677
So,Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1054
01:05:14,391 --> 01:05:16,825
Hit this shit, man.
It's good stuff.

1055
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:19,627
Oh, fuck.

1056
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,633
That's some bad shit, dude.

1057
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:27,636
You hit that?.

1058
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:31,973
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1059
01:05:35,178 --> 01:05:36,645
Bad shit.

1060
01:05:37,647 --> 01:05:40,138
Why areyou
heading to NewJersey?.

1061
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:43,652
It's just this thing I have to do.

1062
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,210
We're going home.

1063
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:48,052
Oh.
Doyou two live together?.

1064
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:49,989
Unfortunately, yes.

1065
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:55,393
So, how long haveyou two
been together?.

1066
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:58,497
A while.

1067
01:05:58,568 --> 01:06:02,299
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1068
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:03,964
How'd you meet?.

1069
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,632
We were stationed together.

1070
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:08,074
See, that's beautiful.

1071
01:06:08,144 --> 01:06:12,012
Everybody's always up in arms
about this ""out in the military"" issue.

1072
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:14,208
Pardon?.

1073
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:18,584
You know, there's all the macho bullshit
about it being ""this man's army.""

1074
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:20,919
You two meet there, hook up--

1075
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:25,054
You thinkwe're lovers?.
No, no. We're not gay.

1076
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:27,562
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

1077
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,758
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?.

1078
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:36,767
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1079
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,400
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1080
01:06:39,476 --> 01:06:41,068
I call it being dumped.

1081
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:43,135
I was...

1082
01:06:43,213 --> 01:06:44,874
dumped once.

1083
01:06:44,948 --> 01:06:47,883
Don'tyou just constantly
question yourvalue?.

1084
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:50,579
Like, whywas I so easy
to cast aside?.

1085
01:06:50,653 --> 01:06:54,248
And you wonder ifthe other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1086
01:06:54,324 --> 01:06:55,757
and call you back.

1087
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:59,283
They always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1088
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:01,455
When actually...

1089
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:03,226
it hurts more.

1090
01:07:06,636 --> 01:07:08,866
You know what we need?.

1091
01:07:08,938 --> 01:07:10,769
What do we need?.

1092
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,364
We need drinks.

1093
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,910
We need a lot of drinks.

1094
01:07:17,514 --> 01:07:19,448
Garcon.

1095
01:07:25,855 --> 01:07:27,880
You still go to church?.

1096
01:07:27,957 --> 01:07:30,118
Every Sunday.

1097
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:32,593
Does it do anything foryou?.

1098
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:35,825
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook everyweek.

1099
01:07:35,899 --> 01:07:39,960
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1100
01:07:40,036 --> 01:07:42,300
They go to church and feel bored...

1101
01:07:42,372 --> 01:07:45,773
but they keep going everyweek
just out ofhabit.

1102
01:07:45,842 --> 01:07:48,140
I am so buzzed.

1103
01:07:49,746 --> 01:07:52,681
When doyou think
you lostyour faith?.

1104
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:54,979
I remember the exact moment.

1105
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:01,351
I was on the phone with my mother...

1106
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:05,383
and she was trying to counsel me
through this--

1107
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:07,962
this thing.

1108
01:08:10,066 --> 01:08:14,503
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1109
01:08:14,571 --> 01:08:16,505
she said...

1110
01:08:16,573 --> 01:08:18,473
"" Bethany...

1111
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:20,475
God has a plan."

1112
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,577
I was-- I was so angrywith her.

1113
01:08:29,686 --> 01:08:31,278
I was like...

1114
01:08:31,354 --> 01:08:33,288
""What about my plans??"

1115
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:35,221
- You know?.
- Mm-hmm.

1116
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:38,317
I had planned
to have a family...

1117
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:40,055
with my husband.

1118
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:43,064
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?.

1119
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,904
Apparently not.

1120
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:56,201
How aboutyou?.
How'd you loseyour faith?.

1121
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,610
A long time ago.

1122
01:08:59,682 --> 01:09:03,174
One day God just stopped listening.

1123
01:09:03,252 --> 01:09:07,814
I kept talking, but I got the distinct
impression He wasn't listening anymore.

1124
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:11,382
How did you know She was listening
in the first place?.

1125
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,164
Well, I guess I don't.

1126
01:09:16,232 --> 01:09:18,462
I hate thoughts like that.

1127
01:09:19,602 --> 01:09:22,662
But, you know,
they come toyou with age.

1128
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:27,108
'Cause when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1129
01:09:28,645 --> 01:09:31,409
God's in Heaven, and He's--

1130
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:34,917
She's always got her eye on you.

1131
01:09:39,422 --> 01:09:42,357
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1132
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:50,694
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1133
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:01,105
Where is this pilgrimage to?.

1134
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:04,374
- You wouldn't believe me ifl told you.
- Try me.

1135
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:06,779
All right, but I warned you.

1136
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:08,544
Okay.

1137
01:10:08,618 --> 01:10:12,213
I'm going to this church
in NewJersey.

1138
01:10:12,288 --> 01:10:14,085
Really.

1139
01:10:14,157 --> 01:10:18,594
Kerwood Mandel to car three.
Kerwood Mandel to car three.

1140
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:22,119
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1141
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:24,132
from going into the church.

1142
01:10:26,035 --> 01:10:27,900
They're trying--

1143
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:29,403
Shit.

1144
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:33,641
They're trying
to get back into Heaven.

1145
01:10:37,013 --> 01:10:39,607
See, they got tossed
out of Heaven...

1146
01:10:39,682 --> 01:10:41,149
years ago, right?.

1147
01:10:42,218 --> 01:10:44,413
And ifthey get back in...

1148
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:46,352
it proves God wrong...

1149
01:10:46,422 --> 01:10:49,585
and since God is infallible...

1150
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:51,422
to prove Herwrong...

1151
01:10:51,494 --> 01:10:54,759
would, you know, unmake existence.

1152
01:10:56,532 --> 01:10:58,659
May I haveyourattention, please.

1153
01:10:58,735 --> 01:11:03,001
The dining car will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

1154
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:05,700
I feel so stupid...

1155
01:11:05,775 --> 01:11:07,709
just saying it.

1156
01:11:09,178 --> 01:11:11,510
The thing I don't get is...

1157
01:11:11,581 --> 01:11:14,277
how am I supposed to stop
an angel?.

1158
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,783
Two, even!

1159
01:11:20,923 --> 01:11:24,290
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1160
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,487
Maybeyou're supposed to kill them.

1161
01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:29,759
Oh, yeah, right.
Kill them.

1162
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:35,594
I mean, even ifthat were the case,
which it's not...

1163
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:39,865
how doyou kill an angel, Barry?.

1164
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:42,668
Oh...

1165
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:44,645
I don't suppose
it's much different from...

1166
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:47,148
killing a human.

1167
01:11:48,584 --> 01:11:51,178
Where is everybody?.
I wake up and--

1168
01:11:53,122 --> 01:11:55,056
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1169
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:58,150
Rufus, I wantyou to meet
my new friend Barry.

1170
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:03,488
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1171
01:12:03,566 --> 01:12:06,330
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1172
01:12:06,402 --> 01:12:08,666
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?.

1173
01:12:08,738 --> 01:12:12,333
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?.

1174
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:15,309
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1175
01:12:15,378 --> 01:12:18,279
Save it. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1176
01:12:18,347 --> 01:12:19,279
Loki!

1177
01:12:20,349 --> 01:12:21,611
Holy shit. The apostle.

1178
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:23,777
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1179
01:12:23,853 --> 01:12:25,844
What areyou doing here?.

1180
01:12:25,922 --> 01:12:27,856
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1181
01:12:27,924 --> 01:12:29,858
- Us?.
- No, two other fucking angels.

1182
01:12:29,926 --> 01:12:33,589
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?.

1183
01:12:33,663 --> 01:12:36,461
You haven't thought about
the consequences ofyour reentry.

1184
01:12:36,532 --> 01:12:38,227
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1185
01:12:38,301 --> 01:12:41,236
We're going home,
no matterwhose pride it may hurt.

1186
01:12:41,304 --> 01:12:43,795
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1187
01:12:43,873 --> 01:12:46,569
What areyou, high?. I can't kill her
ifshe hasn't done anything.

1188
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:48,075
Fine.
I'll kill her myself.

1189
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:50,476
I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?.

1190
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:53,106
- These guys are fuckin' flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1191
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:04,751
Oh, shit!

1192
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:07,662
Jay!

1193
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:10,059
Biggie!

1194
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:12,600
The door! The door!

1195
01:13:16,405 --> 01:13:18,669
Can't we talk about this?.

1196
01:13:24,146 --> 01:13:27,138
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1197
01:14:07,123 --> 01:14:08,556
No ticket.

1198
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:14,557
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1199
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:18,122
- Then you know who she was, don't you?.
- The scion, I imagine!

1200
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:21,026
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1201
01:14:21,103 --> 01:14:24,300
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1202
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:28,332
And Azrael tells us we're marked?.
There's more to this than we thought of.

1203
01:14:28,411 --> 01:14:30,436
I was close.

1204
01:14:30,513 --> 01:14:33,676
You know?. I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1205
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:34,841
Whoa.

1206
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:38,182
You know how I felt?.
Righteous.

1207
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:39,846
Justified.
Eager, even.

1208
01:14:39,922 --> 01:14:41,981
You all right?.
Your eyes are kinda--

1209
01:14:42,058 --> 01:14:44,185
My eyes are open.

1210
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,194
For the first time I get it.

1211
01:14:46,262 --> 01:14:50,062
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1212
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:53,898
See, in the beginning it was
just us and Him-- angels and God.

1213
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,733
Then He created humans.

1214
01:14:55,805 --> 01:14:58,831
Ours was designed to be
a life ofservitude and worship...

1215
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:02,173
and bowing and scraping and adoration.

1216
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:06,681
He gave them more than He ever gave us.
He gave them a choice.

1217
01:15:06,749 --> 01:15:10,048
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore Him.

1218
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:12,053
All this time
we've been down here...

1219
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:14,715
I've felt the absence
ofthe Divine Presence...

1220
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:18,089
and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1221
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:22,119
And why?.
Because ofthe way He made us.

1222
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:25,531
Had we been given free will we could
choose to ignore the pain, like they do.

1223
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:27,398
But no, we're servants.

1224
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:29,495
Okay.

1225
01:15:29,572 --> 01:15:33,099
All I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1226
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:37,077
Wake up! These humans have besmirched
everything He's bestowed upon them.

1227
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:39,080
Theywere given paradise;,
they threw it away.

1228
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:41,582
Theywere given this planet;
they destroyed it.

1229
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:44,210
Theywere favored best
among all His endeavors...

1230
01:15:44,286 --> 01:15:47,619
and some ofthem
don't even believe He exists!

1231
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:49,783
And in spite ofit all...

1232
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:53,590
He has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1233
01:15:53,662 --> 01:15:55,459
at every turn.

1234
01:15:55,531 --> 01:15:57,055
What about us?.

1235
01:15:58,234 --> 01:16:01,169
I asked you once...

1236
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:04,172
to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1237
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,071
What was the result?.

1238
01:16:06,142 --> 01:16:08,406
Our expulsion from paradise.

1239
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:11,071
Where was His
infinite fucking patience then?.

1240
01:16:11,147 --> 01:16:13,980
It's not right!
It's not fair!

1241
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:15,984
We've paid our debt!

1242
01:16:17,453 --> 01:16:20,217
Don'tyou think it's time?.

1243
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:23,156
Don'tyou think it's time
we went home?.

1244
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:29,820
And to do that, I thinkwe may have to
dispatch ourwould-be dispatchers.

1245
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:32,595
Wait. Wait, wait.
Kill them?.

1246
01:16:33,702 --> 01:16:36,432
You're talking about the last scion,
for Christ's sake.

1247
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:39,440
And what aboutJay and Bob?.
Those guys were all right.

1248
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:41,066
Don't.
Don't, my friend.

1249
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:44,772
Don't letyour sympathies
get the best ofyou.

1250
01:16:44,847 --> 01:16:46,337
They did me once.

1251
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:48,315
Scion or not...

1252
01:16:48,384 --> 01:16:49,817
she's just a human...

1253
01:16:49,885 --> 01:16:53,048
and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1254
01:16:53,122 --> 01:16:55,113
No harm, no foul.

1255
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:59,227
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1256
01:17:00,763 --> 01:17:02,128
What did you say?.

1257
01:17:02,198 --> 01:17:05,292
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don'tyou do that to me.

1258
01:17:05,367 --> 01:17:08,393
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shutyour fucking face!

1259
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:11,565
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1260
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,234
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1261
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:16,870
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1262
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,872
Well, fuck that.

1263
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:24,318
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the Throne.

1264
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:27,414
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1265
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:30,687
We're going home, Loki...

1266
01:17:30,759 --> 01:17:34,820
and no one, notyou,
not even the Almighty Himself...

1267
01:17:34,897 --> 01:17:36,831
is gonna make that otherwise.

1268
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:44,772
Shit.

1269
01:17:45,975 --> 01:17:49,604
Why couldn't we stay on the train?.
You threw those guys off.

1270
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,407
Very basic strategy.

1271
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,916
Ifyour enemies know whereyou are,
then don't be there.

1272
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:56,110
Why are we enemies?.

1273
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:59,552
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1274
01:17:59,622 --> 01:18:03,023
What does that mean?. Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?.

1275
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:06,755
I'm tired
of all this cryptic bullshit.

1276
01:18:06,829 --> 01:18:09,389
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1277
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:12,730
and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1278
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:15,201
unless you come clean right now.

1279
01:18:15,271 --> 01:18:17,364
Why me?.

1280
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:20,931
Out of all the people
on the goddamn planet, whywas I tapped?.

1281
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,945
Imagineyou're a 1 2-year-old boy.

1282
01:18:25,181 --> 01:18:29,208
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1283
01:18:29,285 --> 01:18:32,880
How long doyou think it would take to
come to grips with something that huge?.

1284
01:18:32,955 --> 01:18:35,617
Maybe, say, 1 8 years?.

1285
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:40,788
In the Bible,Jesus suddenly
goes from age 1 2 to 30. 1 2 to 30.

1286
01:18:40,863 --> 01:18:43,093
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1287
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:46,100
Where are the volumes oftext
dealing with the missing 1 8 years?.

1288
01:18:46,168 --> 01:18:47,499
I'll tell you where.

1289
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:52,303
Theywere offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1290
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:55,400
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1291
01:18:55,477 --> 01:18:58,241
to cover up
""the truth about Christ.""

1292
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,016
Oh, bullshit.

1293
01:19:02,084 --> 01:19:04,075
Any important material
about Christ...

1294
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:06,747
would give people a better understanding
ofthe nature ofGod.

1295
01:19:06,822 --> 01:19:10,849
- Whywould they leave any ofit out?.
- Because it's tied in with His family.

1296
01:19:10,926 --> 01:19:13,952
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1297
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:18,295
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Marywas a virgin.

1298
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:22,736
Mary gave birth to Christ without having
known a man's touch. This is true.

1299
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:24,739
But she did have a husband.

1300
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:28,504
Doyou really think hewould've stayed
married to her for all thoseyears...

1301
01:19:28,577 --> 01:19:30,169
ifhe wasn't gettin' laid?.

1302
01:19:30,246 --> 01:19:33,682
The nature ofGod and theVirgin Birth,
those are leaps offaith.

1303
01:19:33,749 --> 01:19:38,015
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1304
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:39,213
Meaning?.

1305
01:19:39,288 --> 01:19:41,222
The blood that flows
through yourveins...

1306
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,986
shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1307
01:19:44,059 --> 01:19:45,822
with the oneyou call Jesus.

1308
01:19:46,895 --> 01:19:48,795
Bethany, you are...

1309
01:19:48,864 --> 01:19:53,892
the great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandniece...

1310
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:55,903
ofJesus Christ.

1311
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:03,802
So, that would make Bethany
part black?.

1312
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:10,451
I can't do this anymore.

1313
01:20:15,591 --> 01:20:18,890
Whereyou gonna go?.
You know what I'm saying is right.

1314
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:20,758
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1315
01:20:20,829 --> 01:20:22,421
It's bullshit!

1316
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:28,467
Let her go, man.

1317
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:30,027
Give her time.

1318
01:20:37,346 --> 01:20:39,371
Why?.

1319
01:20:39,448 --> 01:20:42,383
What the fuck do You want from me?.

1320
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:44,851
I fucking hate You!

1321
01:20:45,788 --> 01:20:47,449
I hate You.

1322
01:20:47,523 --> 01:20:49,787
He can't hearyou, you know.

1323
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:57,590
That's whywe needed you.

1324
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,964
Why didn'tyou tell me?.

1325
01:21:00,035 --> 01:21:01,195
Would you--

1326
01:21:02,271 --> 01:21:04,569
Could you have believed me?.

1327
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:07,866
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1328
01:21:08,777 --> 01:21:11,075
Only after everything you've seen...

1329
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:13,306
everything you've heard...

1330
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:18,411
could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1331
01:21:18,487 --> 01:21:20,478
I don't want this.

1332
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:25,785
It's too big.

1333
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:27,556
That's whatJesus said.

1334
01:21:29,732 --> 01:21:31,666
I had to tell Him.

1335
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:37,896
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1336
01:21:38,974 --> 01:21:41,306
not to be able
to tell the Son Himself...

1337
01:21:41,377 --> 01:21:44,369
because oneword from His lips would
destroythe boy's frail human form.

1338
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:47,813
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1339
01:21:47,883 --> 01:21:50,113
who wanted nothing more
than to playwith other children.

1340
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:54,315
I had to tell this little boy
that He was God's only son...

1341
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,325
and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1342
01:21:57,393 --> 01:22:00,624
at the hands ofthe very people
He'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1343
01:22:02,831 --> 01:22:04,992
He begged me to take it all back.

1344
01:22:06,402 --> 01:22:07,994
As ifl could.

1345
01:22:09,705 --> 01:22:12,503
He begged me to
""make it all not true.""

1346
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:16,977
I'll letyou in on something, Bethany,
something I've never told anyone before.

1347
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:20,381
Ifl had the power...

1348
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,283
I would have.

1349
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:25,213
It's unfair.

1350
01:22:25,287 --> 01:22:28,950
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1351
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:31,322
and to askyou to do the same now.

1352
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:33,122
I sympathize. I do.

1353
01:22:33,195 --> 01:22:35,629
I wish I could take it all back.

1354
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,692
But I can't.

1355
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:44,004
This...

1356
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,333
is whoyou are.

1357
01:22:49,244 --> 01:22:51,838
Everything I am has been a lie?.

1358
01:22:55,884 --> 01:23:00,480
Knowing whatyou now know
doesn't mean you're not whoyou were.

1359
01:23:00,556 --> 01:23:01,682
You are...

1360
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:03,349
Bethany Sloane.

1361
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:06,360
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1362
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:12,963
All this means is
a redefinition ofthat identity.

1363
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:16,664
The incorporation ofthis new data
into whoyou are.

1364
01:23:16,738 --> 01:23:18,933
Be whoyou've always been.

1365
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:21,168
Just...

1366
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:23,737
be this as well...

1367
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:28,006
from time to time.

1368
01:23:31,587 --> 01:23:34,522
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1369
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:36,854
To say the least.

1370
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,560
Doyou mind ifwe adjourn
to somewhere...

1371
01:23:47,636 --> 01:23:50,264
a tad more habitable...

1372
01:23:50,339 --> 01:23:51,931
and a bit warmer?.

1373
01:24:06,788 --> 01:24:09,484
Fuck, I think this shit
just kicked in.

1374
01:24:09,558 --> 01:24:12,425
Weren't we just in the woods?.
What are we doing here now?.

1375
01:24:12,494 --> 01:24:14,485
Going out in style.

1376
01:24:14,563 --> 01:24:17,157
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1377
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:19,063
Now, who's this motherfucker?.

1378
01:24:19,134 --> 01:24:21,329
The voice ofGod.
Show some respect.

1379
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:23,837
Oh, the voice ofGod.
Where's the rest of Him?.

1380
01:24:23,906 --> 01:24:26,170
Funnyyou should mention that.
We're not sure.

1381
01:24:26,241 --> 01:24:29,005
- What?.
- Didn't it ever occur toyou...

1382
01:24:29,077 --> 01:24:33,104
that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of His control?.

1383
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:34,944
Yes, but then whywas she tapped?.

1384
01:24:35,017 --> 01:24:39,010
You know those constitutionals
that He likes to take?.

1385
01:24:39,087 --> 01:24:40,349
""Constitutionals""?.

1386
01:24:40,422 --> 01:24:42,913
I thinkwe're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1387
01:24:42,991 --> 01:24:44,925
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1388
01:24:46,194 --> 01:24:49,254
The Lord has quite a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it foryears.

1389
01:24:49,331 --> 01:24:51,356
He assumes a human form once a month
and indulges.

1390
01:24:51,433 --> 01:24:54,960
Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing.
He just goes away for a couple ofhours.

1391
01:24:55,037 --> 01:24:58,666
And He always gives His free points away
to neighborhood children.

1392
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,173
Isn't that sweet?.

1393
01:25:00,242 --> 01:25:03,837
But She hasn't come back
from one ofthese day trips?.

1394
01:25:03,912 --> 01:25:06,312
No, ""She"" hasn't...

1395
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:09,214
and we've been unable to locate "" Her.""

1396
01:25:09,284 --> 01:25:12,617
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1397
01:25:12,688 --> 01:25:16,556
No, there's a different sort
offoul play afoot, children.

1398
01:25:17,693 --> 01:25:21,185
Whomever has set the renegade angels
on their path...

1399
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:23,697
and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1400
01:25:23,765 --> 01:25:26,757
is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1401
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:29,099
Were He to be killed in human form...

1402
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,833
He'd have returned
immediately to Heaven.

1403
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:33,898
Someone knew enough...

1404
01:25:33,976 --> 01:25:36,103
to keep Him biologically alive...

1405
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:39,147
but incapacitate Him
in another fashion.

1406
01:25:39,214 --> 01:25:41,978
And as omnipotent as we are above...

1407
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:45,508
I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without His presence.

1408
01:25:45,587 --> 01:25:47,521
We've looked everywhere for Him.

1409
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:52,458
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind this.

1410
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:55,826
But whoever he is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys afteryou...

1411
01:25:55,897 --> 01:25:57,990
as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1412
01:25:58,066 --> 01:25:59,829
Could it be Lucifer?.

1413
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:01,300
Not Lucifer.

1414
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:04,897
Ifhe was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1415
01:26:04,973 --> 01:26:07,908
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1416
01:26:07,976 --> 01:26:11,207
because he's had just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1417
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:12,746
What do we do now?.

1418
01:26:12,814 --> 01:26:15,681
I saywe get drunk,
'cause I'm all out ofideas.

1419
01:26:15,751 --> 01:26:18,720
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?.

1420
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:20,618
I beg your pardon?.

1421
01:26:20,689 --> 01:26:22,623
The guy in charge
ofthe church thing.

1422
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,360
Cardinal Glick?.

1423
01:26:27,429 --> 01:26:29,590
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1424
01:26:29,665 --> 01:26:33,032
Ifit's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed orwhatever, right?.

1425
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:34,398
Good Lord.

1426
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:36,528
The little stoner's got a point.

1427
01:26:36,605 --> 01:26:41,201
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
cancelling the rededication ceremony.

1428
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:43,301
""We""?.

1429
01:26:43,378 --> 01:26:46,472
Areyou saying you're back in,
Ms. I-Don't-Think-I-Can-Do-This-Anymore?.

1430
01:26:50,786 --> 01:26:54,119
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now would I?.

1431
01:26:56,992 --> 01:26:57,924
Well...

1432
01:26:59,161 --> 01:27:02,995
the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1433
01:27:03,065 --> 01:27:06,228
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1434
01:27:06,301 --> 01:27:10,795
but ifwe can let 'em know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1435
01:27:10,872 --> 01:27:13,932
we can win 'em back,
even get some new ones.

1436
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:15,601
Excuse me.

1437
01:27:17,646 --> 01:27:19,273
Fill them pews, people.

1438
01:27:19,347 --> 01:27:22,282
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1439
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:24,841
Hook 'em while they'reyoung.

1440
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:29,084
- Kinda like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if onlywe had their numbers.

1441
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:32,285
We really appreciateyou seeing us
this late in the day, Your Eminence.

1442
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:35,955
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope oftalking toyou...

1443
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:38,522
about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1444
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,091
You looking to help out in some way?.

1445
01:27:41,169 --> 01:27:43,967
We'd likeyou to cancel the ceremony.

1446
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,667
I beg your pardon.

1447
01:27:46,742 --> 01:27:50,769
There's gonna be a world oftrouble if
tomorrow's ceremony goes on as planned.

1448
01:27:51,847 --> 01:27:54,680
Areyou pro-choice?.

1449
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,342
The trouble's not from us.

1450
01:27:56,418 --> 01:27:59,785
It's from these renegade angels that've
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1451
01:28:02,524 --> 01:28:05,049
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1452
01:28:05,127 --> 01:28:07,322
See, Padre, it goes down like this.

1453
01:28:07,395 --> 01:28:12,128
These guys think that by passing through
that archway, they can go to Heaven.

1454
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,829
You want me to call offthe ceremony
for that.

1455
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:18,031
Who sentyou?.

1456
01:28:20,108 --> 01:28:23,168
We were sent
by Him who is called I Am!

1457
01:28:23,245 --> 01:28:25,839
Cute. Really cute.

1458
01:28:25,914 --> 01:28:28,314
Playtime with the cardinal is over.

1459
01:28:28,383 --> 01:28:31,011
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out ofthis.

1460
01:28:31,086 --> 01:28:32,713
It's not a joke.

1461
01:28:32,788 --> 01:28:35,882
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1462
01:28:35,957 --> 01:28:38,926
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1463
01:28:38,994 --> 01:28:41,929
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent ofthe slave trade?.

1464
01:28:41,997 --> 01:28:44,557
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?.

1465
01:28:44,633 --> 01:28:47,067
All right, mistakes were made.

1466
01:28:47,135 --> 01:28:50,229
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1467
01:28:50,305 --> 01:28:52,330
responsible for the oversights of old.

1468
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:56,173
I'm a very important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1469
01:28:56,244 --> 01:28:57,734
so ifyou please--

1470
01:28:57,813 --> 01:29:00,577
- But tomorrow--
- Tomorrow goes offwithout a hitch.

1471
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:02,014
Do I make myself clear?.

1472
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:06,747
Neitheryou nor any other influence
short ofthe hand ofGod Himself...

1473
01:29:06,822 --> 01:29:09,757
is gonna keep this thing
from going offwithout a hitch.

1474
01:29:30,745 --> 01:29:32,770
I can see the headlines now...

1475
01:29:32,848 --> 01:29:34,782
ifthere were gonna be any.

1476
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:36,477
"" Existence Erased.""

1477
01:29:36,551 --> 01:29:38,781
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1478
01:29:38,854 --> 01:29:41,220
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1479
01:29:43,725 --> 01:29:44,885
What up.

1480
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,224
You stole the cardinal's driver?.

1481
01:29:47,295 --> 01:29:49,456
That's what he gets
for messin' with our girlfriend.

1482
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:51,294
Cross-dressin' fuck.

1483
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:53,800
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1484
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:58,505
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?.

1485
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:01,770
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill 'em.

1486
01:30:01,843 --> 01:30:03,970
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1487
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:08,310
Theywon't be killed.

1488
01:30:08,383 --> 01:30:11,443
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1489
01:30:11,519 --> 01:30:12,781
right here...

1490
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:15,914
until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1491
01:30:17,025 --> 01:30:19,084
There's only one idiot here,
Azrael...

1492
01:30:22,397 --> 01:30:24,558
and I'm looking right at him.

1493
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:26,157
Muse!

1494
01:30:27,502 --> 01:30:30,630
Just in time tojoin us
for a drink.

1495
01:30:32,107 --> 01:30:33,199
Hey.
Where'd you come from?.

1496
01:30:35,043 --> 01:30:36,977
- Where'd you come from?.
- Me?.

1497
01:30:37,045 --> 01:30:38,569
Nothingness.

1498
01:30:38,647 --> 01:30:42,378
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1499
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:46,011
All right, Plato,
sounds likeyou've had enough already.

1500
01:30:46,087 --> 01:30:48,578
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1501
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:52,320
Come on, barkeep,just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?.

1502
01:30:52,394 --> 01:30:55,522
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1503
01:30:55,597 --> 01:30:57,360
Is that who I think it is?.

1504
01:30:57,432 --> 01:30:58,729
- None other than.
- Who is he?.

1505
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,564
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1506
01:31:01,636 --> 01:31:03,797
Give me a...

1507
01:31:03,872 --> 01:31:06,340
Holy Bartender.

1508
01:31:06,408 --> 01:31:08,308
Never heard ofit.

1509
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:12,244
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1510
01:31:12,314 --> 01:31:14,248
You do, don'tyou, Muse?.

1511
01:31:14,316 --> 01:31:15,374
Don't.

1512
01:31:16,484 --> 01:31:17,644
Anybody?.

1513
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:19,209
No?.

1514
01:31:19,287 --> 01:31:22,814
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1515
01:31:31,399 --> 01:31:32,491
Get it?.

1516
01:31:32,567 --> 01:31:34,831
Sweet Jesus, Azrael!
Why?.

1517
01:31:34,903 --> 01:31:38,430
Come on, Demon! Try that shit
on somebodywho's already dead!

1518
01:31:38,506 --> 01:31:41,942
Oh, Apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1519
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:45,036
and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1520
01:31:45,113 --> 01:31:47,274
The Christ bitch will join you.

1521
01:31:47,349 --> 01:31:50,512
Areyou really that stupid?.

1522
01:31:50,585 --> 01:31:54,112
You do know what's gonna happen
ifthose two jerks enter that church.

1523
01:31:54,189 --> 01:31:56,555
I'm actually counting on it.

1524
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,953
And if my calculations
are correct...

1525
01:32:00,028 --> 01:32:02,758
the pawns are moving into checkmate
as we speak.

1526
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:11,263
"" Holy Bartender."" I get it.
That's a great one!

1527
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:15,571
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1528
01:32:15,643 --> 01:32:17,440
for coming this morning.

1529
01:32:17,512 --> 01:32:20,447
She's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1530
01:32:22,117 --> 01:32:26,816
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
ofhistory about this particular...

1531
01:32:26,888 --> 01:32:29,550
hundred-years-young house ofGod.

1532
01:32:29,624 --> 01:32:30,921
God's house?.

1533
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:35,023
God doesn't live here anymore.

1534
01:32:35,096 --> 01:32:37,894
He's grown weary
ofyour superficial faith.

1535
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:40,901
He's turned a deaf ear
toyour lip-service prayers.

1536
01:32:40,969 --> 01:32:44,302
- He has abandoned you, his favorites...
- Sorry.

1537
01:32:44,372 --> 01:32:46,306
to the whim ofjudgment.

1538
01:32:46,374 --> 01:32:48,899
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1539
01:32:50,578 --> 01:32:53,206
prepare to taste God's wrath.

1540
01:32:53,281 --> 01:32:56,216
-Maybe we should just leave.
-You wanted your body count. You got it.

1541
01:32:56,284 --> 01:32:58,912
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1542
01:32:58,987 --> 01:33:00,249
Officer McGhee.

1543
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,819
All right, mouthpiece...

1544
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:05,689
Iet's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1545
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,160
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1546
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:10,163
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

1547
01:33:10,231 --> 01:33:12,096
Is that so?.

1548
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:18,134
Ladies and gentlemen...

1549
01:33:18,206 --> 01:33:23,701
you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1550
01:33:23,778 --> 01:33:26,178
and this very day...

1551
01:33:26,247 --> 01:33:30,013
I assureyou you will all
pay foryour trespasses...

1552
01:33:30,085 --> 01:33:31,848
in blood.

1553
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,218
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1554
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:35,347
Do it!

1555
01:33:36,558 --> 01:33:39,288
- So he's a muse too?.
- Former muse.

1556
01:33:40,962 --> 01:33:44,363
He was kicked out.

1557
01:33:44,432 --> 01:33:46,900
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1558
01:33:46,968 --> 01:33:48,060
Then what happened?.

1559
01:33:48,136 --> 01:33:50,297
Yes, what?.

1560
01:33:50,371 --> 01:33:54,330
Well, Luciferjust had to start
his little war for the throne.

1561
01:33:54,409 --> 01:33:56,969
Heaven became divided
into two factions--

1562
01:33:57,045 --> 01:33:59,240
the faithful and the renegades.

1563
01:33:59,314 --> 01:34:02,147
Oh, the Ethereal Plains
were chaotic with battle.

1564
01:34:02,217 --> 01:34:05,015
Angel against angel.

1565
01:34:05,086 --> 01:34:08,522
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1566
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:10,490
But Azrael refused to fight.

1567
01:34:10,558 --> 01:34:14,050
He remained in the middle,
waiting to see who came out victorious.

1568
01:34:14,129 --> 01:34:16,222
What areyou,
some kind offuckin' chicken?.

1569
01:34:16,297 --> 01:34:17,594
No.

1570
01:34:17,665 --> 01:34:19,530
I was an artist...

1571
01:34:19,601 --> 01:34:21,728
stupid!

1572
01:34:21,803 --> 01:34:23,464
I was inspiration!

1573
01:34:23,538 --> 01:34:26,029
A muse has no place in battle.

1574
01:34:26,107 --> 01:34:28,837
So after the fallen
were banished to Hell...

1575
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:30,844
God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1576
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:33,278
and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1577
01:34:33,348 --> 01:34:36,146
something he considers
a great injustice.

1578
01:34:36,217 --> 01:34:38,378
Oh, come on.

1579
01:34:38,453 --> 01:34:41,513
Don't tell meyou never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1580
01:34:41,589 --> 01:34:44,353
No.
It never bothered me.

1581
01:34:44,425 --> 01:34:46,450
Soyou were an artist.

1582
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,291
Big deal!

1583
01:34:48,363 --> 01:34:50,422
Elvis was an artist...

1584
01:34:50,498 --> 01:34:53,865
but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time ofwar.

1585
01:34:53,935 --> 01:34:55,869
That's why he is the king...

1586
01:34:55,937 --> 01:34:57,871
and you're a schmuck.

1587
01:34:57,939 --> 01:34:59,099
Nice.

1588
01:34:59,174 --> 01:35:01,074
So all this is about revenge.

1589
01:35:01,142 --> 01:35:04,134
You're gonna unmake existence
becauseyou have a grudge against God?.

1590
01:35:04,212 --> 01:35:07,978
After the first million years?.
No.

1591
01:35:08,049 --> 01:35:11,883
Escape from Hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1592
01:35:11,953 --> 01:35:16,447
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1593
01:35:16,524 --> 01:35:18,048
which it finally did...

1594
01:35:18,126 --> 01:35:20,094
in Catholicism.

1595
01:35:20,161 --> 01:35:21,423
Plenary indulgence.

1596
01:35:21,496 --> 01:35:23,396
But I couldn't exercise it.

1597
01:35:23,464 --> 01:35:25,932
Demons can't become human.

1598
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,161
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1599
01:35:29,637 --> 01:35:31,104
But angels can.

1600
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:33,671
Bartleby and Loki.

1601
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:38,402
After that it was a simple matter
ofwaiting for a church...

1602
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:40,276
to celebrate their centennial...

1603
01:35:40,348 --> 01:35:45,980
and when that finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1604
01:35:46,054 --> 01:35:47,988
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1605
01:35:48,056 --> 01:35:50,183
kept them cloaked
and off Heaven's radars.

1606
01:35:50,258 --> 01:35:53,421
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1607
01:35:53,494 --> 01:35:57,294
no soul in Hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1608
01:35:57,365 --> 01:36:00,357
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1609
01:36:00,435 --> 01:36:03,927
so I dispatched Him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1610
01:36:04,005 --> 01:36:06,439
Her. And how?.

1611
01:36:06,507 --> 01:36:09,101
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1612
01:36:09,177 --> 01:36:12,112
Oh, no, I've seen
way too many Bond movies to know...

1613
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:15,115
thatyou never reveal
all the details ofyour plan...

1614
01:36:15,183 --> 01:36:18,619
no matter how close
you may thinkyou are to winning.

1615
01:36:18,686 --> 01:36:21,883
The only ""X"" factorwas the involvement
ofthe last scion here.

1616
01:36:23,224 --> 01:36:27,320
But fat lot of good that did, right?.
I mean, hereyou all are.

1617
01:36:30,098 --> 01:36:33,261
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1618
01:36:33,334 --> 01:36:37,464
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules toyou...

1619
01:36:37,538 --> 01:36:41,440
but ifyou succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1620
01:36:41,509 --> 01:36:44,478
Human, haveyou ever been to Hell?.

1621
01:36:44,545 --> 01:36:46,740
I think not.

1622
01:36:46,814 --> 01:36:49,078
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1623
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:53,484
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1624
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:56,079
Still thinking only aboutyourself...

1625
01:36:56,157 --> 01:36:58,091
you fucking child!

1626
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,252
Now, now, now.

1627
01:37:01,129 --> 01:37:04,155
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1628
01:37:04,232 --> 01:37:06,792
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?.

1629
01:37:06,868 --> 01:37:08,836
Yo, put on channel 9.
Daveyand Goliath.

1630
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:14,641
Actually, I was thinking
more along the lines of current events.

1631
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:17,143
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

1632
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:20,078
I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...

1633
01:37:20,148 --> 01:37:22,309
have laid waste to St. Michael's!

1634
01:37:22,383 --> 01:37:24,749
Bullets don't seem to affect them!

1635
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:28,488
The remainder ofthe crowd
have dropped to their knees...

1636
01:37:28,556 --> 01:37:30,922
identifying this
as the fabled apocalypse.

1637
01:37:30,992 --> 01:37:33,859
Now, I'm not a man offaith,
but I'm inclined to agree.

1638
01:37:33,928 --> 01:37:38,126
Oh, God, please, don 't come any closer!
God, no!

1639
01:37:46,207 --> 01:37:49,438
You see that?.
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1640
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:53,105
I 'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not going to matter anyway.

1641
01:37:57,251 --> 01:37:58,275
Oh?.

1642
01:37:59,754 --> 01:38:02,188
Oh, now what was that
all about?.

1643
01:38:02,256 --> 01:38:03,883
What?.

1644
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:06,449
Oh, nothing.

1645
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:08,688
I had something in my eye.

1646
01:38:08,763 --> 01:38:11,527
Now who's the fucking child?.

1647
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,897
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?.

1648
01:38:16,571 --> 01:38:20,234
Areyou serious?. I'm a fucking demon.
You'd have him assault mewith a putter?.

1649
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:23,368
You want to play?.
Then we'll play.

1650
01:38:23,444 --> 01:38:25,241
One side, Red.

1651
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,675
Go ahead, then.
Pick it up.

1652
01:38:27,749 --> 01:38:28,909
Call it a gift.

1653
01:38:30,385 --> 01:38:32,376
Come on.

1654
01:38:32,453 --> 01:38:33,886
That's it.

1655
01:38:35,423 --> 01:38:37,015
Take a shot.

1656
01:38:37,091 --> 01:38:40,686
Takeyour best fucking shot.

1657
01:38:42,163 --> 01:38:44,563
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1658
01:38:45,733 --> 01:38:47,667
Come on, bright boy.

1659
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:58,274
Don'tyou know anything?.

1660
01:39:13,761 --> 01:39:15,695
Bethany, bless the sink!

1661
01:39:15,763 --> 01:39:17,628
- What?.
-Just do it!

1662
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:19,689
Bless the sink, damn it!

1663
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:46,153
That's whatyou get,
motherfucker.

1664
01:39:48,696 --> 01:39:50,891
But I'm a fucking demon.

1665
01:39:58,206 --> 01:39:59,468
What just happened?.

1666
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:02,202
He said it himself;.
""I'm a fucking demon.""

1667
01:40:02,276 --> 01:40:06,645
Hit a demon with an instrument ofGod,
the pure side so it'll do some damage.

1668
01:40:06,714 --> 01:40:08,773
Silent Bob's an instrument ofGod?.

1669
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:12,786
No, but Glick's the kind ofasshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1670
01:40:12,854 --> 01:40:15,914
- But the sink?.
- You've got the divine heritage.

1671
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:18,254
Sanctifying is just
one ofthe fringe benefits.

1672
01:40:18,326 --> 01:40:20,760
Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing
at my next party.

1673
01:40:20,828 --> 01:40:24,025
- How far away is this church?.
- Three towns over, about ten miles.

1674
01:40:24,098 --> 01:40:26,032
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead ofyou.

1675
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,330
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1676
01:40:28,402 --> 01:40:31,633
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1677
01:40:43,451 --> 01:40:45,146
Oh, my God.

1678
01:40:57,932 --> 01:41:00,662
And people wonderwhy
I don't go to church anymore.

1679
01:41:00,735 --> 01:41:01,997
Are we too late?.

1680
01:41:02,069 --> 01:41:04,663
To save these poor schmucks?.

1681
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,532
Yeah.

1682
01:41:07,608 --> 01:41:10,270
But we still exist.

1683
01:41:10,344 --> 01:41:12,175
Where are they?.

1684
01:41:12,246 --> 01:41:14,737
They could already be
in the church.

1685
01:41:14,815 --> 01:41:16,908
Which means ifthey come out,
nobody touches them.

1686
01:41:16,984 --> 01:41:18,417
Areyou shitting me?.

1687
01:41:18,486 --> 01:41:22,513
The brother here is gonna shred 'em with
his angel-be-good special. Huh, homey?.

1688
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:24,524
Ifthey pass through that arch,
they come out clean.

1689
01:41:24,592 --> 01:41:26,719
And ifthey die,
they go straight up.

1690
01:41:26,794 --> 01:41:29,228
And hello!
We know what happens then, right?.

1691
01:41:29,297 --> 01:41:31,697
- Why don't theyjust kill themselves?.
- It's a mortal sin.

1692
01:41:31,766 --> 01:41:34,599
Die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They don't want to go to hell.

1693
01:41:34,669 --> 01:41:38,537
Then what, are we supposed to just wait
for a solution to fall from the sky?.

1694
01:41:42,743 --> 01:41:44,108
Friend ofyours?.

1695
01:41:44,178 --> 01:41:46,112
No, that was a cardinal.

1696
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:50,014
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1697
01:41:50,084 --> 01:41:52,678
It's one ofthem!
Kill that motherfucker!

1698
01:41:52,753 --> 01:41:54,015
Don'tyou listen?.

1699
01:41:54,088 --> 01:41:57,080
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1700
01:41:57,158 --> 01:41:59,456
He's been at it for a while now.

1701
01:41:59,527 --> 01:42:01,119
Please! Please!

1702
01:42:02,296 --> 01:42:04,230
We ran out of parishioners...

1703
01:42:04,298 --> 01:42:08,632
so he just started picking up folk
offthe road and just dropping 'em.

1704
01:42:08,703 --> 01:42:11,934
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1705
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:15,067
If only they'd let us jerk off.

1706
01:42:16,444 --> 01:42:18,207
Whoops.
Take a step back.

1707
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:23,983
Let me go!

1708
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:27,417
Why?.
What areyou trying to prove?.

1709
01:42:27,488 --> 01:42:30,889
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1710
01:42:31,892 --> 01:42:33,325
Jesus Christ!

1711
01:42:34,662 --> 01:42:36,596
I just wanted to go home.

1712
01:42:36,664 --> 01:42:38,495
But him, you know...

1713
01:42:38,566 --> 01:42:40,966
he just lost it.

1714
01:42:41,035 --> 01:42:44,266
He realized whoyou were
and whatyou were gonna have to do.

1715
01:42:44,338 --> 01:42:45,805
He just snapped.

1716
01:42:45,873 --> 01:42:49,502
The funny thing is, this guy
could never even stand to see me work.

1717
01:42:49,577 --> 01:42:52,671
He said he felt sorry
foryou people.

1718
01:42:53,714 --> 01:42:55,272
Now look at him.

1719
01:42:55,349 --> 01:42:57,408
This guy's fuckin' drunker than hell.

1720
01:42:57,485 --> 01:42:59,976
Which means he's human now.

1721
01:43:01,355 --> 01:43:03,448
His wings have been cut off.

1722
01:43:10,064 --> 01:43:11,998
The muse?.

1723
01:43:12,066 --> 01:43:14,159
Oh, no way!

1724
01:43:14,235 --> 01:43:17,033
I haven't seen you--
You look terrific. Wow!

1725
01:43:17,104 --> 01:43:19,265
What's with the tits?.
Can I--

1726
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:21,604
Haveyou walked
through the arch yet?.

1727
01:43:24,979 --> 01:43:28,540
Tell me. Have you gone in
and come out through the archwayyet?.

1728
01:43:28,616 --> 01:43:29,981
No!

1729
01:43:35,056 --> 01:43:36,489
He's back.

1730
01:43:59,814 --> 01:44:01,748
We were awaiting your arrival.

1731
01:44:01,816 --> 01:44:04,876
Bartleby, wait. Stop.
Listen to me.

1732
01:44:04,952 --> 01:44:07,682
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1733
01:44:07,755 --> 01:44:09,017
Ifyou go back--

1734
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:12,882
I've become aware ofthe repercussions.
I know what I'm doing.

1735
01:44:14,328 --> 01:44:16,023
You sick, twisted fuck!

1736
01:44:17,598 --> 01:44:18,860
Bethany.

1737
01:44:22,036 --> 01:44:25,369
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1738
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:28,374
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1739
01:44:28,442 --> 01:44:31,502
Butyou've only dealt with the pain
a fewyears.

1740
01:44:31,579 --> 01:44:34,673
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1741
01:44:34,749 --> 01:44:39,186
Whileyou never seeyour ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his newwife--

1742
01:44:40,755 --> 01:44:42,017
and he is--

1743
01:44:45,192 --> 01:44:49,925
seeing you people every day on this
perfect world He created foryou...

1744
01:44:49,997 --> 01:44:51,726
is a constant reminder...

1745
01:44:51,799 --> 01:44:54,859
that though my kind came first...

1746
01:44:54,935 --> 01:44:57,028
your kind was most revered.

1747
01:44:58,272 --> 01:45:00,638
And whileyou know forgiveness...

1748
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:02,642
we know only regret.

1749
01:45:03,711 --> 01:45:05,542
The lesson must be taught.

1750
01:45:05,613 --> 01:45:07,547
All are accountable...

1751
01:45:07,615 --> 01:45:08,877
even God.

1752
01:45:10,151 --> 01:45:12,346
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1753
01:45:12,419 --> 01:45:15,684
just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1754
01:45:16,924 --> 01:45:20,416
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1755
01:45:20,494 --> 01:45:21,984
will cease to be.

1756
01:45:22,062 --> 01:45:23,620
No. Hey. Hey!

1757
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:28,267
I can't letyou do that,
Bartleby.

1758
01:45:28,335 --> 01:45:30,428
This has gone too far.

1759
01:45:32,406 --> 01:45:34,840
I might have to takeyou down.

1760
01:45:36,377 --> 01:45:38,208
It's okay. Shh.

1761
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:39,871
I'll do it.

1762
01:45:44,652 --> 01:45:46,586
My compatriot.

1763
01:45:47,922 --> 01:45:50,482
Genocide takes a lot out ofhim.

1764
01:45:50,558 --> 01:45:51,820
He's weakened.

1765
01:45:51,892 --> 01:45:53,359
You're weak.

1766
01:45:53,427 --> 01:45:56,260
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1767
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:58,525
a condition which carries
two liabilities--

1768
01:46:00,334 --> 01:46:02,131
a conscience...

1769
01:46:02,937 --> 01:46:04,370
and...

1770
01:46:07,374 --> 01:46:09,968
a short life span.

1771
01:46:10,044 --> 01:46:12,842
I'm sorry, old friend,
butyou lost the faith.

1772
01:46:40,608 --> 01:46:42,542
He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1773
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:44,908
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1774
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:47,713
I can't believe this.

1775
01:46:47,781 --> 01:46:50,409
We're on the brink of nonexistence,
and God's still nowhere to be found.

1776
01:46:50,484 --> 01:46:53,578
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?.
- Amen to that.

1777
01:47:00,461 --> 01:47:02,588
What the hell areyou doing?.

1778
01:47:02,663 --> 01:47:06,190
Ifthe whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1779
01:47:10,237 --> 01:47:13,172
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1780
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:16,835
We can lay here all comatose like that
John DoeJersey bastard over there...

1781
01:47:16,911 --> 01:47:19,846
- orwe can get makin' with the love.
- What did you say?.

1782
01:47:19,914 --> 01:47:22,007
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1783
01:47:22,082 --> 01:47:23,606
No, aboutJohn DoeJersey.

1784
01:47:27,421 --> 01:47:30,413
That guy, the one theywon't take
offlife support--John DoeJersey.

1785
01:47:30,491 --> 01:47:32,550
This is where he's at--
St. Michael's Hospital.

1786
01:47:34,094 --> 01:47:35,561
Where's the nearest boardwalk?.

1787
01:47:35,629 --> 01:47:38,257
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1788
01:47:38,332 --> 01:47:40,800
- Where is it?.
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1789
01:47:40,868 --> 01:47:42,927
- Haveyou ever been there?.
- Once, with this chick.

1790
01:47:43,003 --> 01:47:46,029
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1791
01:47:46,106 --> 01:47:47,971
- Do they have skeeball there?.
- Yeah.

1792
01:47:51,378 --> 01:47:53,312
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1793
01:48:01,322 --> 01:48:04,416
Whateveryou do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1794
01:48:04,491 --> 01:48:06,652
Bob, come with me.
Come on!

1795
01:48:06,727 --> 01:48:09,423
- How am I supposed to do that?.
- Think of something!

1796
01:48:09,496 --> 01:48:11,726
I already did,
but it takes two of us!

1797
01:48:12,566 --> 01:48:14,796
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1798
01:48:14,868 --> 01:48:16,665
This is the apocalypse.

1799
01:48:16,737 --> 01:48:19,467
Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.

1800
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:21,303
Thank you.

1801
01:48:36,724 --> 01:48:38,351
Hey, Big Bi rd!

1802
01:48:39,226 --> 01:48:40,921
Ready for the counti ng game?.

1803
01:48:45,699 --> 01:48:47,667
Count the shel ls, Suck-a-Duck.

1804
01:49:15,863 --> 01:49:17,831
No more bullets.

1805
01:49:17,898 --> 01:49:20,093
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?.

1806
01:49:20,167 --> 01:49:23,102
Angels have to cut theirwings off
to become human.

1807
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:25,229
You just did him a favor,
stupid!

1808
01:50:11,985 --> 01:50:14,681
I hopeyou're the skeeball type.

1809
01:50:55,796 --> 01:50:58,230
Oh, Bartleby.

1810
01:50:58,298 --> 01:51:01,961
Was Wisconsin really that bad?.

1811
01:51:02,035 --> 01:51:04,128
Bow down, stupid!

1812
01:51:22,689 --> 01:51:24,623
I'm sorry.

1813
01:51:47,014 --> 01:51:50,211
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1814
01:51:50,284 --> 01:51:54,050
would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1815
01:51:54,121 --> 01:51:56,180
What the fuck?.

1816
01:52:02,329 --> 01:52:04,354
Thankyou.

1817
01:52:36,163 --> 01:52:37,824
It never ends!

1818
01:52:57,851 --> 01:52:59,944
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1819
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:02,511
What the fuck is this shit?.

1820
01:53:02,589 --> 01:53:04,318
Who the fuck areyou, lady?.

1821
01:53:04,391 --> 01:53:06,859
Why the fuck did you hug my head?.

1822
01:53:06,927 --> 01:53:09,862
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?.

1823
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:12,899
What the fuck is this, The Piano?.
Why ain't this broad talkin'?.

1824
01:53:12,966 --> 01:53:18,302
I believe the answers thatyou seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1825
01:53:18,372 --> 01:53:21,671
What the fuck does that mean?.
Has everyone gone fuckin' nuts?.

1826
01:53:21,742 --> 01:53:24,711
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head?.

1827
01:53:24,778 --> 01:53:26,769
Shh.

1828
01:53:42,296 --> 01:53:43,991
Where was she?.

1829
01:53:44,064 --> 01:53:46,624
Imprisoned in a body.

1830
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:49,635
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1831
01:53:51,138 --> 01:53:52,730
Hang on a minute.

1832
01:54:27,207 --> 01:54:29,141
You missed a bit.

1833
01:54:30,677 --> 01:54:33,612
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?.

1834
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:36,148
You ready to make some ofthose
changes I been talking about?.

1835
01:54:36,216 --> 01:54:37,376
We'll see.

1836
01:54:37,451 --> 01:54:39,009
Muse?.

1837
01:54:39,086 --> 01:54:41,680
Seeing as howyou
just had to get involved...

1838
01:54:41,755 --> 01:54:44,019
you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1839
01:54:44,091 --> 01:54:47,026
First I gotta say good-bye to Bethany.
Where is she?.

1840
01:54:47,094 --> 01:54:48,527
Oh, no.

1841
01:55:09,783 --> 01:55:12,251
Metatron, is she--

1842
01:55:12,319 --> 01:55:14,651
Afraid so.

1843
01:55:14,721 --> 01:55:18,714
One ofthe drawbacks to being a martyr
is that you have to die.

1844
01:55:18,792 --> 01:55:21,352
But no matter.

1845
01:55:30,871 --> 01:55:32,805
All is being taken care of.

1846
01:55:33,907 --> 01:55:35,340
How so?.

1847
01:55:36,476 --> 01:55:39,570
Wax on, wax off.

1848
01:56:03,136 --> 01:56:04,262
How did I--

1849
01:56:04,337 --> 01:56:06,032
She can rebuild you.

1850
01:56:06,106 --> 01:56:07,698
She has the technology.

1851
01:56:07,774 --> 01:56:11,870
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1852
01:56:17,651 --> 01:56:18,777
That's...

1853
01:56:19,853 --> 01:56:22,651
A very relieved deity.

1854
01:56:24,424 --> 01:56:27,120
You did well, little girl.
I knewyou'd come 'round.

1855
01:56:27,194 --> 01:56:29,628
Your kind always does.

1856
01:56:30,831 --> 01:56:33,299
You might want to
take good care ofyourself.

1857
01:56:33,366 --> 01:56:36,164
We're gonna need you down the road.

1858
01:56:36,236 --> 01:56:38,704
I know.
I'm the last scion.

1859
01:56:41,374 --> 01:56:44,502
Well, you're half right.

1860
01:56:44,578 --> 01:56:47,513
You were the last scion.

1861
01:56:49,249 --> 01:56:50,682
But now...

1862
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:53,275
this...

1863
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:56,113
is the last scion.

1864
01:56:59,159 --> 01:57:01,093
I'm pregnant?.

1865
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:05,591
Can't put anything pastyou.

1866
01:57:08,902 --> 01:57:11,427
Take care ofthat parcel for us.

1867
01:57:11,505 --> 01:57:15,441
She has a world ofwork
ahead ofher.

1868
01:57:26,853 --> 01:57:28,912
Thankyou for...

1869
01:57:28,989 --> 01:57:30,980
I don't know...

1870
01:57:31,057 --> 01:57:32,319
everything.

1871
01:57:36,062 --> 01:57:39,498
God, there's a million things
I wish I could askyou...

1872
01:57:39,566 --> 01:57:43,627
most ofit questioning your great plan,
and that'd be arrogant of me, I know.

1873
01:57:44,404 --> 01:57:46,531
But there is one I need to ask.

1874
01:57:46,606 --> 01:57:50,235
I'm sureyou get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?.

1875
01:57:52,212 --> 01:57:54,180
Why are we here?.

1876
01:58:10,764 --> 01:58:13,699
Didn't I tell you she was funny?.

1877
01:58:20,574 --> 01:58:23,168
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1878
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:26,071
It was an honor.

1879
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:33,685
You did so well.

1880
01:58:38,325 --> 01:58:41,260
I told you She was a woman.

1881
01:58:43,229 --> 01:58:45,595
She's not really a woman.

1882
01:58:45,665 --> 01:58:48,133
She's not really anything.

1883
01:58:48,201 --> 01:58:49,862
She's something, all right.

1884
01:58:51,071 --> 01:58:53,301
Crisis offaith over?.

1885
01:58:53,373 --> 01:58:56,308
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1886
01:58:56,376 --> 01:58:58,310
When it rains, it pours.

1887
01:58:58,378 --> 01:59:00,608
Areyou saying you believe?.

1888
01:59:01,915 --> 01:59:03,906
But I have a good idea.

1889
01:59:03,984 --> 01:59:05,417
Yes!

1890
01:59:09,356 --> 01:59:11,290
The Man was right aboutyou.

1891
01:59:11,358 --> 01:59:14,384
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell Him so.

1892
01:59:15,295 --> 01:59:17,229
And ifyou clean upyour language...

1893
01:59:17,297 --> 01:59:19,765
I just might put in
a good word foryou too.

1894
01:59:19,833 --> 01:59:21,425
Thanks.

1895
01:59:22,969 --> 01:59:25,403
Why don'tyou name the kid
after me?.

1896
01:59:28,241 --> 01:59:30,004
Rufus.

1897
01:59:56,403 --> 01:59:58,837
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1898
02:00:03,677 --> 02:00:05,611
Youse guys
wanna hear something sick?.

1899
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:08,614
I got half a stalk
when she kissed me.

1900
02:00:08,682 --> 02:00:11,116
I couldn't help it.
The bitch was hot.

1901
02:00:11,184 --> 02:00:15,746
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1902
02:00:15,822 --> 02:00:17,312
You're pregnant?.

1903
02:00:18,992 --> 02:00:22,519
You know, when you're pregnantyou can
have sex until the third trimester.

1904
02:00:22,595 --> 02:00:24,529
I'll keep that in mind.

1905
02:08:04,557 --> 02:08:08,459
So, that wouldmake Bethany
part black?
