1
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:06,766
Ninety-one, 92...

2
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:09,439
- It's down there.
- Where? If they catch us...

3
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,608
There's a million
bottles of booze in there.

4
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:13,299
You think they're
gonna miss one?

5
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,652
Weather is with us, sir.

6
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:34,225
We arrive in port
in a couple of hours.

7
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:35,990
Very good.

8
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,963
You're welcome, sir.

9
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:46,970
Man, I never smelt anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

10
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:50,409
Oh, what, your shit
smells like roses?

11
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:51,911
Hey, look.

12
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,881
I'll give you a hand.

13
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,583
- Thought you said it was booze.
- That's what the papers said.

14
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,762
Captain, we have a breach
in lower level. Look.

15
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,527
- Which section?
- 101.

16
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:15,702
Fuck. Take the wheel.

17
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:17,305
- Yes, sir.
- Fuck.

18
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,572
Close the door! Get the masks.

19
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,945
Holy shit.

20
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:32,612
Take care of them.

21
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,796
- Morning.
- Passport, please.

22
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:26,465
Rough seas?

23
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:30,342
The sea was smooth. The party was a
bit rough, if you know what I mean.

24
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:32,072
- Ibiza.
- Yeah.

25
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:33,716
Thanks.

26
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:47,126
When I was a kid, my father
used to take me fishing.

27
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:50,562
Never could figure out how
he knew where the fish were.

28
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:55,138
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

29
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:21,295
Security check.

30
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,291
Do I look like
a security risk?

31
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:26,627
Please step out of the car and
bring your documents to the office.

32
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,063
My documents are
right here, sir.

33
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:31,400
The computer is in the office.

34
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:34,137
Her too.

35
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,006
She's sleeping.

36
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:38,977
- With her documents.
- Okay, sure.

37
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,024
You're gonna lose it.

38
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,232
Close, inspector,
you're close.

39
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:08,044
That's a big one.
Go left, go left.

40
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:12,411
Don't let him get away.

41
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,349
You're close.

42
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,217
Go left, go left! Go right!

43
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,127
Must be Moby Dick you
hooked. Need some help?

44
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:32,393
No, thank you, Frank.

45
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:36,968
I have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.

46
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:45,747
You were close,
inspector. You were close.

47
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,983
Good thing that we French have such
a highly developed sense of humor.

48
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:56,725
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

49
00:06:56,927 --> 00:07:00,055
- Jerry Lewis is a genius.
- Dean was the genius.

50
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:03,324
No, Dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.

51
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:06,503
My point exactly. Anyone can
fall down and get a laugh.

52
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:09,935
How many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?

53
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:24,682
I am afraid our day of
leisure is cut short.

54
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:26,355
There is a mess in Marseilles.

55
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:29,424
Some madman driving an
Audi at impossible speeds.

56
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:33,896
Don't look at me.

57
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:36,965
That is the first place
the chief told me to look.

58
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:41,331
But I will tell him you
have the perfect alibi.

59
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:44,738
As usual.

60
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:51,642
Tarconi!

61
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,450
- Please!
- I am sorry, Frank.

62
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:57,746
- It's our first bite!
- Yeah, yeah.

63
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,354
- Please.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:02,024
Stop the boat. Come on.

65
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:04,956
- No. No, Frank.
- Come on, please.

66
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:48,763
Purpose of your
visit, Mr. Johnson?

67
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,529
Business.

68
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,336
What kind of business?

69
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:54,740
Environmental protection.

70
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:02,744
Thank you.

71
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,422
Mr. Minister, you're giving the
opening address at an EU conference...

72
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,355
...on environmental impact of
industry in Odessa tomorrow.

73
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:14,292
- What is top on your list of priorities?
- It's a short list.

74
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:17,228
There's one item: the
environment and how to protect it.

75
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,231
In the face of
increasing pressure...

76
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:22,371
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...

77
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:25,906
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.

78
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,079
Well, not as harsh as a polluted
and uninhabitable planet.

79
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,974
Gentlemen, if you'll
excuse me now...

80
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:34,378
...I have trees to save and
industrialists to disappoint.

81
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:40,283
- Your speech for tomorrow.
- Any good?

82
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:44,692
- It's going to piss off a lot of people.
- Excellent.

83
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:08,807
Hello?

84
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,783
Mr. Minister?

85
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:13,812
Who is this?

86
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:16,522
My name is not important.

87
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:18,957
I've been put in charge
of the negotiations...

88
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:21,563
...you are engaged
in with Ecocorp...

89
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:25,030
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the Ukraine.

90
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:27,703
You must be misinformed,
Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is.

91
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:29,964
I've terminated
negotiations permanently.

92
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:32,574
I think you will
reconsider that position...

93
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:36,177
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.

94
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:53,062
I'll be in touch.

95
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:36,669
Yeah, there's
been an accident.

96
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,373
Send an ambulance, 8
Route de la Falaise.

97
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:00,194
Malcolm.

98
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:02,058
Malcolm. Malcolm.

99
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,639
I asked you for your
price. What is this?

100
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:14,902
A man who might be interested
in taking the job. This man will.

101
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:17,276
My boss said you're
the man for the job.

102
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:19,142
Your boss got his facts wrong.

103
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,542
Two things you should
know about my boss:

104
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:26,985
He never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.

105
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,215
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

106
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:40,928
Well, not this time.

107
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:49,236
You don't wanna do this.

108
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:53,382
I don't think you're in a position to
tell me what I do and don't wanna do.

109
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,552
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

110
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,325
I'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

111
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:06,314
Malcolm. Malcolm.

112
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:07,512
You hear me?

113
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:12,525
Mal, I said drop in
anytime, but I didn't mean...

114
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:15,592
- Nowhere else to go.
- Just take it easy, okay?

115
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,528
Don't move me from the car.

116
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:22,694
- It's just till the ambulance arrives.
- No ambulance.

117
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:26,508
You need a doctor, you've been
shot. I can't take care of this.

118
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:30,880
Not far from car.

119
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:33,440
Relax.

120
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:38,447
Just try to stay calm. We'll
have you fixed up in no time.

121
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,491
He's inside.
Quick, it's serious.

122
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,062
Sir?

123
00:14:57,274 --> 00:15:00,471
- You wanna be careful moving him.
- We know our job, okay?

124
00:15:00,677 --> 00:15:03,168
Sir, can you hear me?

125
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,904
This car... No...

126
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,639
If you hear me, press my hand.

127
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:08,381
The car...

128
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:00,536
Am I in heaven?

129
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:03,205
Actually, you're in
a bit of the shit.

130
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:06,365
You'll help me out of it?

131
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,806
That depends on
how deep you're in.

132
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,307
- Don't trust anyone.
- Couldn't agree with you more.

133
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:16,109
- Come on.
- No! Don't leave the car!

134
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,482
- What's so special about the car?
- Not the car.

135
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:33,465
Wait!

136
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:03,254
I told you.

137
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:10,168
<i>Don't trust anyone.</i>

138
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,265
<i>I told you.</i>

139
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,922
I took the liberty
of bringing your suit.

140
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,292
It's what you wear when
you're working, correct?

141
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,162
Correct. But I'm not working.

142
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:16,797
- You see, boss? I told you.
- Please, Joseph.

143
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:21,466
Your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.

144
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:23,236
Thank you.

145
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:24,902
As I was saying...

146
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:28,243
...we came to you in good faith.
You said you were unavailable.

147
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:30,885
We contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.

148
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,611
He proved to be ineffective.

149
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:36,087
And now I am left with
unfinished business.

150
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:38,591
The way I see it,
you're responsible.

151
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:41,120
I understand your
point of view.

152
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,525
But I'm still unavailable.

153
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:46,001
Boss, can I say something?

154
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,068
Anyone else wanna
say something?

155
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,734
Good.

156
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,037
Find me a smarter one.

157
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:02,408
You have three seconds
to change your mind...

158
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:05,383
...or you're gonna be
permanently unavailable.

159
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:07,580
One.

160
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:10,848
Two.

161
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:15,156
One condition.

162
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,791
I'm listening.

163
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:22,698
I drive my own car.

164
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:25,474
Deal.

165
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:32,179
In anticipation of your answer, we
took the liberty of bringing your car.

166
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:36,318
Changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.

167
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,046
Left the switch-over
license plates. Love that.

168
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,520
Replaced the GPS
with one of our own.

169
00:19:42,726 --> 00:19:44,591
Preprogrammed. More
efficient that way.

170
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:49,021
Why I was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?

171
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:54,202
We're playing in a
much larger game here.

172
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:59,068
Don't think of this as just another
job. Think of it as a mission.

173
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:03,944
I'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.

174
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:06,206
I make a deal, that's
the deal. Just like you.

175
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,146
You don't like names. Neither
do I. We're both precise.

176
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:12,446
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...

177
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:16,614
...beyond what we are paid to
do. Those are your rules, right?

178
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:26,428
You forgot one.

179
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:29,937
- I work alone.
- I thought you might like the company.

180
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:32,705
Thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.

181
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:36,741
You're right. I do.

182
00:20:39,516 --> 00:20:40,710
Wait.

183
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:44,553
What, you wanna
change the rules?

184
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,920
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

185
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:53,322
You're the boss.

186
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,090
Anything else?

187
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:00,565
The jewelry. Anything
I should know?

188
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,868
You remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...

189
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,909
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?

190
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:12,013
Same principle, just refined.

191
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,910
Twenty-five feet
from the car...

192
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:17,518
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.

193
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,517
Fifty feet, orange.

194
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:22,052
Second liquid flows
into the chamber.

195
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:25,227
Seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.

196
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:32,230
Time to go.

197
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:36,432
This phone is programmed to
call only one number, mine.

198
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:41,375
When you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?

199
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:45,448
Money for gas and food.

200
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:46,842
Any other questions?

201
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:20,642
Would you mind
buckling your seat belt?

202
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:34,724
Don't suppose you wanna tell
me what this is all about?

203
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:42,437
Great.

204
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:00,714
Ocean Pearl requesting
cargo clearance.

205
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:04,916
The papers are with the
environmental agency.

206
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:07,228
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

207
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,058
- We'll inform you when they're signed.
- Okay.

208
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:21,337
I know what happened to you.

209
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:23,774
But what happened to Frank?

210
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,615
Colonel Medved over at Intelligence
has been given all the information.

211
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,621
He knows it's top priority.

212
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:38,385
He wants you to know he
has his best men on it.

213
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,756
He'll keep it out
of official channels.

214
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:44,627
He suggests you buy as
much time as you can.

215
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:44,788
Look, I don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. And I don't really care.

216
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:47,292
You were here first, you
know more than I do...

217
00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:49,192
...download me
on what you know.

218
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:50,957
I know nothing.

219
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,362
How did you know Malcolm?

220
00:24:53,803 --> 00:24:54,792
I didn't.

221
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:58,238
You just happened to end up in
a car with a man you don't know?

222
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,503
I'm now in a car
with man I don't know.

223
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,008
Aren't you supposed
to make a call?

224
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:14,856
<i>Nice to hear from you.</i>

225
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:18,118
You can skip the pleasantries.
Just give me the code.

226
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:20,088
<i>1- 1-
2-6.</i>

227
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,733
<i>Call me when you arrive.</i>

228
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:30,904
What's in Budapest?

229
00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:33,371
Goulash. Beer.

230
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:41,611
All right.

231
00:25:41,818 --> 00:25:44,616
Let's rewind here, start
with the proper introductions.

232
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:47,779
What happened to
the rule of no names?

233
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,050
I'm suspending that
rule for the moment.

234
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,325
I'm Frank Martin.

235
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:00,067
And your name is?

236
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,638
What matters, my name?

237
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:09,143
Well, we're in this
situation together.

238
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:11,236
No.

239
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:17,647
We're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.

240
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:20,755
I'd call that being
in the same situation.

241
00:26:21,224 --> 00:26:23,784
It's not. They are
going to kill you.

242
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:27,786
I'm aware of that.

243
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:31,757
In all probability, after they
kill me, you're next on the list.

244
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:35,495
Now, if I'm gonna keep that from
happening, I'm gonna need a little help.

245
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:38,333
From the top. We
have this problem.

246
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,509
You think I don't
know it's a problem?

247
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:42,842
I look stupid to you?

248
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:46,037
I didn't say you were stupid.

249
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:49,149
But we have a problem...

250
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:53,015
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.

251
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,954
I don't want to talk anymore.

252
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,595
Fine.

253
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:20,710
What did you say
your name was?

254
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:24,653
Frank. Frank Martin.

255
00:27:25,655 --> 00:27:27,782
Frank Martin.

256
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:30,182
Valentina.

257
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,753
Pleased to meet you.

258
00:28:31,754 --> 00:28:33,915
<i>The gentlemen from
Ecocorp are here.</i>

259
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:36,551
Show them in.

260
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:45,356
Gentlemen.

261
00:28:48,638 --> 00:28:50,162
Mr. Minister.

262
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:53,240
We'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...

263
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,377
...on such short notice.
- You make it very hard not to.

264
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:00,208
Well, yes. We do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.

265
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,617
Here are the contracts.

266
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:05,545
All in order.

267
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:08,414
We were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...

268
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,615
...unless you personally
signed off on them.

269
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:12,157
Ships?

270
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,161
I thought there was only one.

271
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:16,831
Oh, well, here's the thing.

272
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:19,763
In order to make the
venture more profitable...

273
00:29:19,969 --> 00:29:22,938
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.

274
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:24,766
How many ships are
we talking about?

275
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:28,740
Plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.

276
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:30,572
Eight.

277
00:29:30,947 --> 00:29:32,107
This year.

278
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:36,408
Protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.

279
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:38,610
You've said so
yourself, haven't you?

280
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:41,346
And I will do again
tomorrow in Odessa...

281
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:44,424
...where I will sign these.

282
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:48,158
We were really hoping
to settle this today.

283
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:52,733
I want to review them, now
that there are some addendums.

284
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:55,096
Twenty-four hours doesn't
make a difference...

285
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:57,670
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?

286
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:01,137
No, of course not.

287
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:05,337
Then I will see you tomorrow
in Odessa. Let's say 9 a. m.

288
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,619
<i>Yes.</i>

289
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:14,551
Okay, I'll stay.

290
00:30:14,757 --> 00:30:16,384
- But the material is leaking.
- And?

291
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:19,152
- We won't be able to hide it.
- I'll take care of it.

292
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:20,659
If ever they check...

293
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:23,161
<i>Easy. The deal will
be closed very soon.</i>

294
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,993
Twenty-four hours. No more.

295
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,876
- Yes?
- I've bought you another 24 hours.

296
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,378
You have until
tomorrow, 9 a. m.

297
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,414
That should be more
than enough time.

298
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:44,850
<i>Do you have a lead?</i>

299
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:46,851
Better than a lead.

300
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,679
A location.

301
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:29,231
I'm hungry.

302
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:32,757
We're 100 kilometers
from beer and sausage.

303
00:31:34,236 --> 00:31:36,636
I don't like sausage.

304
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,376
What would you like?

305
00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:47,175
Veal.

306
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:49,317
Roast, with carrots...

307
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:50,917
...and beets.

308
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,547
In gravy, with
Madeira in stock.

309
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:57,020
Nothing to start?

310
00:32:00,596 --> 00:32:02,564
A salad.

311
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:06,430
Greens tossed with balsamic.

312
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:08,398
From Modena.

313
00:32:08,604 --> 00:32:10,003
Aged?

314
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:12,174
Of course, aged.

315
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:17,202
And for dessert?

316
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:20,073
Sachertorte.

317
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:23,107
With whipped cream or without?

318
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:25,818
With.

319
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:28,453
To drink?

320
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:31,586
Wine.

321
00:32:31,794 --> 00:32:33,591
Tokaj, perhaps?

322
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,188
Ice wine.

323
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:38,162
Of course.

324
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,877
- What are you doing?
- Seeing a man about some jewelry.

325
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:06,117
He's gone off the reservation.

326
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:11,796
Send someone to
get him back on.

327
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:14,368
Don't kill him.

328
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,724
Frank. It's so good to
see you, 'mein Freund'.

329
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,331
Good to see you too, Otto.

330
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:49,193
You didn't mention
you bring company.

331
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:50,864
It's not really company.

332
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,034
It's...

333
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:55,335
...complicated.

334
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:58,513
With you, it's always complicated.
You can tell me about it...

335
00:33:58,714 --> 00:34:02,445
...over a nice schnitzel with
'Kartoffelsalat' I have prepared.

336
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,246
Hey, Otto, you know I
love your schnitzel...

337
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:07,888
...but we need to
get rid of this first.

338
00:34:10,426 --> 00:34:13,884
Binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.

339
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:15,590
English, please, Otto.

340
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:19,057
There's a program the
Pentagon has funded...

341
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:22,362
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...

342
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:25,904
...that's been experimenting
with this new kind of weaponry...

343
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,736
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

344
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:30,969
Very hush-hush stuff.

345
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:35,549
I didn't realize you were in the
loop on the Pentagon hush-hush.

346
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:37,776
You wouldn't believe
what you can discover...

347
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:40,148
...walking through
the Internet.

348
00:34:40,356 --> 00:34:42,586
You wanna see the
invasion plans for Iran?

349
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:44,787
Maybe some other time.

350
00:34:44,994 --> 00:34:48,430
Right now we need to get this thing
off without blowing myself to Iran.

351
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:51,065
I don't wanna bother
you with the details...

352
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:55,795
...but usually there's a
transmitter plate close by.

353
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:03,478
You should not be doing this.

354
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,670
First you don't talk,
now you offer advice.

355
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:08,349
Not advice. A warning.

356
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:10,675
Well, a little late for
warnings, don't you think?

357
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:18,652
I agree with you.

358
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:24,823
You're off course.

359
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:33,567
- Should I?
- Yeah, you should.

360
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:41,139
Look, fellas...

361
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:44,885
...some things in the car were
a bit off, needed checking.

362
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:48,620
In my profession, a man
is only as good as the car.

363
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:52,021
You take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.

364
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,528
The boss says,
"Back on the road. "

365
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:58,363
Frank?

366
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:00,157
Keep at it.

367
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:04,030
Back in the car, Frank.

368
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,934
No.

369
00:37:17,346 --> 00:37:19,405
- Find it?
- Not yet.

370
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:37,750
You're the smart one?

371
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,554
No. I'm the big one.

372
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:34,045
Not so big anymore, are you?

373
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,469
Found it.

374
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:05,202
- The transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

375
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:08,705
It's wired.

376
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,048
If I do:

377
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:11,036
You fight good.

378
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:16,175
But you tie bad.

379
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:22,812
Where are you going?

380
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,121
Tired.

381
00:41:26,328 --> 00:41:28,523
That's why I prefer
to deal with cars.

382
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:31,059
That makes two of us.

383
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,569
What do you want me to do when
they...? When they wake up?

384
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,830
Probably best to take
the rest of the day off.

385
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:57,317
I'm not amused.

386
00:41:57,526 --> 00:41:59,391
You'd be less amused
if you ended up dead.

387
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:01,994
<i>If you wanted me dead,
I'd be dead. You need me.</i>

388
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,995
You want me to complete the
job, I need some clarification.

389
00:42:06,635 --> 00:42:07,727
I'm listening.

390
00:42:08,203 --> 00:42:09,329
In person.

391
00:42:09,538 --> 00:42:10,971
We've already done in person.

392
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:13,266
<i>Well, not to my
satisfaction, apparently.</i>

393
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:16,910
Right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.

394
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:20,538
Same place. One hour.
Wait for my call.

395
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:18,497
Hello?

396
00:43:18,707 --> 00:43:20,641
You've disappointed me.

397
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:23,902
You won't be the first
and you won't be the last.

398
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:28,879
- I told you I wanted to do this in person.
- That won't be necessary. You see...

399
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,143
...since our little
chat at the beginning...

400
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:34,845
...I've been thinking I don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.

401
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:37,217
Any idiot with a
driver's license will do.

402
00:43:37,425 --> 00:43:40,451
So in the words of the
great American, Donald Trump:

403
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:43,995
I'm sorry, but you're fired.

404
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:31,369
Who are you?

405
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,374
- Your new chauffeur.
- I want the old one back.

406
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,915
He's about to go to pieces.

407
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:46,718
You're fired.

408
00:45:50,558 --> 00:45:51,582
How was your nap?

409
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,360
Restful. How was
your phone call?

410
00:45:54,562 --> 00:45:57,030
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

411
00:46:08,944 --> 00:46:09,933
Tarconi.

412
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:11,169
It's me.

413
00:46:12,347 --> 00:46:14,076
I was wondering
when you would call.

414
00:46:14,282 --> 00:46:15,476
I've been busy.

415
00:46:15,684 --> 00:46:18,312
Let me guess. In Budapest?

416
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:20,918
You've been busy too.

417
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:24,256
Never a problem keeping that
way with a friend like you.

418
00:46:24,459 --> 00:46:27,292
So I don't have to be
redundant, tell me what you know.

419
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:29,929
There is a black
Mercedes also in Budapest.

420
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:32,190
<i>Probably not occupied
by friends of yours.</i>

421
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,028
That is what I know. Now
tell me what you know.

422
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:39,170
I have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.

423
00:46:39,374 --> 00:46:41,274
Russian, I think.

424
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:43,670
I don't know what she
has to do with anything.

425
00:46:43,878 --> 00:46:45,846
Have you tried asking her?

426
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:48,106
Now, why didn't
I think of that?

427
00:46:48,116 --> 00:46:50,011
Sorry. Of course you've
asked. And she says?

428
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:51,949
I'm going to die.

429
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:54,451
Typical. Russians.

430
00:46:54,656 --> 00:46:56,851
They are so dark.

431
00:46:57,058 --> 00:47:00,550
I remember, in school, reading
Dostoyevsky and thinking...

432
00:47:00,762 --> 00:47:03,424
...when do these people laugh?

433
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:05,292
One page after the other...

434
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,469
...misery and suffering like
you wouldn't believe, Frank.

435
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:12,071
Inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? I'm blinking here.

436
00:47:12,273 --> 00:47:13,467
Is that code?

437
00:47:14,409 --> 00:47:17,845
No, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.

438
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:20,276
Wired to explode if we
get too far from the car.

439
00:47:20,482 --> 00:47:21,471
<i>They?</i>

440
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:23,207
Some American.

441
00:47:23,451 --> 00:47:26,284
<i>Can you be more specific?
A name? A number?</i>

442
00:47:26,488 --> 00:47:27,512
Nothing.

443
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:29,917
Why do you always
make it so easy, Frank?

444
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,820
It's my nature.

445
00:47:32,027 --> 00:47:33,858
<i>Where are you? I
will come there.</i>

446
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:36,530
That's not a good idea. They
have me on a short leash.

447
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:39,564
I can't be of much help if
you do not give me something.

448
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:43,329
How close are
you to a computer?

449
00:47:47,175 --> 00:47:48,267
Yes, Frank?

450
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:51,240
<i>That wasn't very nice,
back there in the market.</i>

451
00:47:51,446 --> 00:47:54,279
You were the one who
broke the rules, not me.

452
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:56,541
<i>Point well taken.</i>

453
00:47:56,818 --> 00:48:00,345
That makes us even. What say
we start with a clean slate?

454
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:03,683
So this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?

455
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:05,383
<i>More or less.</i>

456
00:48:05,593 --> 00:48:08,494
You have what I need to
get the bracelet off...

457
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:11,529
...I have the packages
you need delivered.

458
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:15,092
Here are the new
coordinates, then: 2-6-12.

459
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:16,970
<i>That'll take you
to the place...</i>

460
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:19,470
<i>...where we can have a
conclusion to this business.</i>

461
00:48:19,674 --> 00:48:21,403
I look forward to it.

462
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:28,712
Frank.

463
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:30,111
<i>Did you get it?</i>

464
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,057
Got the signal. Give
us a little time...

465
00:48:37,258 --> 00:48:39,488
<i>...and we should have
his number and location.</i>

466
00:48:40,862 --> 00:48:42,591
Your new phone, sir.

467
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,439
- Anything else?
- No.

468
00:48:54,943 --> 00:48:58,640
<i>Frank, do you know where
the signal is taking you?</i>

469
00:49:09,023 --> 00:49:13,153
I know restaurant there.
Fish like you never had.

470
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:16,524
Roasted with small
carrots and black pepper.

471
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:19,291
Romanian wine, not so good.

472
00:49:20,902 --> 00:49:23,735
But for the last
meal, could be worse.

473
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:29,506
You really should begin
to think more positive.

474
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:32,077
I'm realist.

475
00:49:34,015 --> 00:49:36,677
My friend was right when he
said you were doom and gloom.

476
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:39,752
What means "doom and gloom"?

477
00:49:39,954 --> 00:49:42,889
You know, you only see the
horrible and the terrible.

478
00:49:43,091 --> 00:49:46,060
Your friend, where does he
get this? He doesn't know me.

479
00:49:46,294 --> 00:49:49,559
He was talking about you in
general. Russians, as a people.

480
00:49:49,764 --> 00:49:51,891
I'm not Russian.
I'm Ukrainian.

481
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,658
Excuse me.

482
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:57,929
Not excused. We're different
people. We're different here...

483
00:49:58,139 --> 00:49:59,299
...and here.

484
00:50:04,979 --> 00:50:08,972
Me, personally, I think there's a
little bit of an optimist in you.

485
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,952
How you can make such a
statement? You don't know me.

486
00:50:14,956 --> 00:50:17,288
Well, I see you're
putting makeup on.

487
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:20,984
If you were so convinced we
was gonna die, why bother?

488
00:50:23,531 --> 00:50:26,967
What does looking good
have to do with dying?

489
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:35,834
Hello.

490
00:50:36,844 --> 00:50:38,004
What's that?

491
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:40,681
Souvenirs from Ibiza.
Do you want one?

492
00:50:40,982 --> 00:50:44,008
No, thank you. And neither
do you. We need to stay sharp.

493
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:47,782
Okay.

494
00:50:52,894 --> 00:50:54,384
You stay sharp.

495
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,463
I stay, how you say? Optimist?

496
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:01,299
Give me that. Give me that
thing. Give me the pill!

497
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:05,868
Give me that...

498
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:13,106
Jesus.

499
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,210
Great.

500
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,585
- Just great.
- Come on, Frank Martin, lighten up.

501
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,655
I should? How about
when those pills hit?

502
00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:27,487
You're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

503
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:28,753
That would be nice.

504
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,798
Boring. Boring. Boring?

505
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,934
Oh, yeah.

506
00:52:12,206 --> 00:52:13,969
You should stay in the car.

507
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:16,641
You want me to pee in car?

508
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:24,110
Okay. Go on.

509
00:52:28,022 --> 00:52:29,387
You remember.

510
00:52:55,616 --> 00:52:57,413
Don't.

511
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,164
Don't.

512
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:22,598
<i>Don't.</i>

513
00:53:43,297 --> 00:53:44,286
Oh, no.

514
00:54:22,537 --> 00:54:25,995
- Stop, all right?
- Why? I don't drive.

515
00:54:26,441 --> 00:54:27,430
I want to have fun.

516
00:54:27,642 --> 00:54:30,975
I want to be happy. You should
try happy instead of so serious.

517
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:34,338
It's important to stay
positive, like you say, yeah?

518
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:37,746
- Drink with me, Frankie.
- I don't want a drink.

519
00:54:40,521 --> 00:54:43,012
Now who is all
gloomy and doomy?

520
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:45,158
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

521
00:54:46,194 --> 00:54:48,321
Come on, get in the car.

522
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,489
I am free, like a bird.

523
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:01,270
The girl! Come on! Faster!

524
00:55:10,051 --> 00:55:12,645
- I have lost my friend!
- I'll buy you a new one.

525
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:29,025
Have any idea why we
have a car on our ass?

526
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:31,736
I don't know. I don't care.

527
00:55:34,075 --> 00:55:36,475
- You mind?
- First you say I'm doom and gloom...

528
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:39,510
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? Make up your mind.

529
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,664
- Yes, Frank?
- I thought we had an agreement.

530
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:33,094
We do.

531
00:56:33,334 --> 00:56:35,199
It had nothing to do
with a car on my ass.

532
00:56:36,837 --> 00:56:41,274
I don't have anything to do with
that. Someone else has issues with you?

533
00:56:41,475 --> 00:56:43,272
Likely.

534
00:56:46,047 --> 00:56:49,380
What I think is that there
are other forces at work here.

535
00:56:49,584 --> 00:56:51,984
Let me check into it,
see what I can find out.

536
00:56:52,186 --> 00:56:53,778
What do I do in the meantime?

537
00:56:53,988 --> 00:56:56,149
Drive faster.

538
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:31,922
What the hell is he doing?

539
00:58:34,955 --> 00:58:36,718
There!

540
00:58:36,924 --> 00:58:38,323
He's down there!

541
00:58:43,898 --> 00:58:45,195
I'm hungry.

542
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:47,560
Should have thought about
a sandwich, not vodka.

543
00:58:49,837 --> 00:58:50,861
Look!

544
00:58:57,278 --> 00:58:59,405
I wasn't hungry
then, I was thirsty.

545
00:58:59,613 --> 00:59:01,274
Why you are so mean to me?

546
00:59:02,616 --> 00:59:05,779
- I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.
- What means "preoccupied"?

547
00:59:11,459 --> 00:59:13,017
That means preoccupied.

548
00:59:24,772 --> 00:59:26,740
Shoot the tires!
Come on! Get him!

549
00:59:28,576 --> 00:59:31,136
- Get down!
- Shoot him!

550
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:43,153
Bloody hell!

551
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,428
Faster!

552
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,502
Stop the car!

553
01:00:03,377 --> 01:00:04,605
Oh, shit!

554
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:11,009
What are you doing?

555
01:01:11,245 --> 01:01:12,678
You're so tense.

556
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,105
You don't say.

557
01:01:19,687 --> 01:01:21,348
I make you relax, okay?

558
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,523
- Yeah.
- I'm good at this.

559
01:01:25,993 --> 01:01:28,223
Making tense go away.

560
01:01:37,238 --> 01:01:38,398
What are you doing?

561
01:01:38,606 --> 01:01:43,373
I want to feel sex one
more time before I die.

562
01:01:43,577 --> 01:01:45,044
Don't you?

563
01:01:47,314 --> 01:01:49,748
What is it with you and dying?

564
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:53,847
There is something
wrong with me?

565
01:01:54,455 --> 01:01:55,717
Am I not sexy?

566
01:01:57,091 --> 01:01:58,217
Yeah, you're sexy.

567
01:02:04,265 --> 01:02:05,254
You're the gay.

568
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:09,798
Nope, I am not the gay.

569
01:02:10,004 --> 01:02:11,904
I don't mind.

570
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,440
I'm not, okay?

571
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:20,540
Then what's the problem?

572
01:02:22,683 --> 01:02:26,449
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe I'm not in the mood?

573
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:47,298
- I thought rule is don't open package.
- It is.

574
01:02:47,508 --> 01:02:49,203
Why you have rules
if you break them?

575
01:02:50,477 --> 01:02:52,172
I keep asking myself
the same thing.

576
01:02:53,647 --> 01:02:55,638
Phone books.

577
01:03:04,058 --> 01:03:06,458
- You're the package.
- Yes.

578
01:03:07,494 --> 01:03:08,859
Could have said something.

579
01:03:09,396 --> 01:03:11,990
- Would it make a difference?
- Yes.

580
01:03:14,068 --> 01:03:15,433
Now what are you doing?

581
01:03:15,636 --> 01:03:18,070
You know, back in garage...

582
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:23,141
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.

583
01:03:23,344 --> 01:03:26,006
I was trying to keep five
cretins from caving my head in.

584
01:03:26,213 --> 01:03:27,646
I don't see the
turn-on in that.

585
01:03:27,848 --> 01:03:32,911
You think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?

586
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,145
I don't like where this
is going, Valentina.

587
01:03:35,356 --> 01:03:38,325
Would you striptease
for me again?

588
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:41,654
Give me the keys.
This is not funny.

589
01:03:41,862 --> 01:03:42,988
You want keys?

590
01:03:47,534 --> 01:03:49,832
I want you to stop playing
around, is what I want.

591
01:03:50,037 --> 01:03:53,302
Maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.

592
01:03:53,507 --> 01:03:55,998
This is not the time or
the place for playing.

593
01:03:56,210 --> 01:04:00,271
Why do I get feeling with
you it's never time or place?

594
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:02,779
If I wanna get analyzed,
I'll see a psychiatrist.

595
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:05,213
Now, give me the keys.

596
01:04:05,753 --> 01:04:08,085
Come on, Frank Martin.

597
01:04:08,288 --> 01:04:10,518
Make playtime for me.

598
01:04:30,577 --> 01:04:33,068
All right? That enough?

599
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,044
Not enough. That is
not a striptease, Frank.

600
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:39,742
Striptease is sexy. You
know, move your ass a little.

601
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,111
Come on, Frank Martin.

602
01:04:42,423 --> 01:04:44,323
You want keys?

603
01:04:44,725 --> 01:04:47,523
I want strip.

604
01:04:53,734 --> 01:04:56,328
You know what I'm gonna do
to you for making me do this?

605
01:04:56,537 --> 01:04:57,970
Spank me?

606
01:04:58,539 --> 01:04:59,767
For starters.

607
01:04:59,973 --> 01:05:02,567
- Tie me up?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

608
01:05:04,044 --> 01:05:06,638
I like the rough stuff.

609
01:05:10,017 --> 01:05:12,008
Really?

610
01:05:16,323 --> 01:05:19,087
Oh, but not too rough.

611
01:05:20,094 --> 01:05:22,460
Deal was a striptease
for the keys.

612
01:05:22,663 --> 01:05:26,121
New deal. Kiss
me for the keys.

613
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:35,173
Like you mean it.

614
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:44,544
Do you ever kiss like
you mean it, Frank?

615
01:05:45,686 --> 01:05:48,052
I'm thinking maybe not.

616
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:50,519
I'm thinking you live alone.

617
01:05:51,525 --> 01:05:53,459
Inside and outside.

618
01:05:54,261 --> 01:05:57,230
Thinking it is not
dying you're afraid of.

619
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:59,296
It's living.

620
01:05:59,566 --> 01:06:01,090
Live with me.

621
01:06:01,301 --> 01:06:03,064
Just this once.

622
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:06,728
Just this moment.
Live with me.

623
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:50,983
- What's his position?
- We lost him.

624
01:06:53,086 --> 01:06:57,045
He headed into the mountains.
We can't get reception up there.

625
01:06:57,257 --> 01:06:59,657
Hack into one of the
military satellites.

626
01:07:06,867 --> 01:07:07,959
Yes.

627
01:07:08,168 --> 01:07:10,432
You think we're playing
games here, Mr. Minister?

628
01:07:10,637 --> 01:07:12,434
I don't know what
you're talking about.

629
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:15,972
I'm talking about a black car full
of your incompetent operatives.

630
01:07:16,176 --> 01:07:19,236
<i>One more move like that and you
will never see your daughter again.</i>

631
01:07:19,446 --> 01:07:20,845
I want to hear her voice.

632
01:07:21,048 --> 01:07:23,676
When the contract is
signed and delivered.

633
01:07:23,884 --> 01:07:26,284
I will not sign until
I hear her voice.

634
01:07:26,486 --> 01:07:29,080
You are in no position to
play hardball, Mr. Minister.

635
01:07:29,289 --> 01:07:31,917
Well, neither are
you, Mr. Johnson.

636
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,789
<i>Yes, I know who you are.</i>

637
01:07:35,128 --> 01:07:38,188
And I can assure you, if
anything happens to my daughter...

638
01:07:38,398 --> 01:07:40,263
...I will use all
the power I have.

639
01:07:40,467 --> 01:07:45,905
I will hunt you down and make you
pay in a most hideous way for this.

640
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:50,537
We have to move now.

641
01:07:56,717 --> 01:07:58,412
Pick up, Frank. Pick up.

642
01:08:15,435 --> 01:08:18,097
I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

643
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:25,674
<i>Someone hands me
glass of champagne.</i>

644
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:27,676
<i>I drink.</i>

645
01:08:28,415 --> 01:08:30,883
<i>Then I don't feel so good.</i>

646
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,958
<i>I go to bathroom, and next
thing, I'm awake in the car.</i>

647
01:08:48,168 --> 01:08:51,968
I ask him, "Where is this?" He
tells me he's just a transporter.

648
01:08:55,842 --> 01:08:58,208
He's pretty good driver.

649
01:08:59,146 --> 01:09:01,307
Not like you good.

650
01:09:02,382 --> 01:09:08,218
I tell him, "Please. My
father a really powerful man.

651
01:09:08,422 --> 01:09:12,791
Big influence. Knows a lot
of people. Let me call him. "

652
01:09:13,193 --> 01:09:15,525
<i>He's afraid. He's
never done this before.</i>

653
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:20,892
It's supposed to be simple.
Pick up, drop off. Easy money.

654
01:09:21,101 --> 01:09:24,434
He's been told no
calls, never leave car.

655
01:09:25,072 --> 01:09:26,801
But I convince him.

656
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:30,336
<i>I call.</i>

657
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:33,241
<i>But before I say to my
father where we are...</i>

658
01:09:33,447 --> 01:09:34,744
Inside the car. Come on!

659
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:43,082
<i>We get away, but...</i>

660
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:48,887
There's people
shooting at us. Why?

661
01:09:49,096 --> 01:09:51,257
Why they shooting at us?

662
01:09:51,465 --> 01:09:56,368
He says they shoot because we
didn't go according to plan.

663
01:09:56,737 --> 01:10:01,197
I said, "Okay, that's the
old plan. What's new plan?"

664
01:10:01,408 --> 01:10:03,706
He says he has a friend.

665
01:10:12,619 --> 01:10:14,917
And then I met you.

666
01:10:17,724 --> 01:10:20,386
And then I feel
it's gonna be okay.

667
01:10:24,998 --> 01:10:27,228
You didn't even know me.

668
01:10:27,968 --> 01:10:29,367
Of course I don't know you.

669
01:10:29,569 --> 01:10:33,061
I talk about
feelings, not knowing.

670
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:39,542
Well, if you was feeling that way,
you sure had a funny way of showing it.

671
01:10:40,313 --> 01:10:43,908
Better for a woman to have
a little mystery to her.

672
01:10:44,117 --> 01:10:45,584
No?

673
01:10:47,154 --> 01:10:48,644
No.

674
01:10:49,156 --> 01:10:52,455
Yes. Just a little.

675
01:11:18,885 --> 01:11:21,046
He's back on the radar, sir.

676
01:11:26,092 --> 01:11:27,992
- Yeah.
- Where the hell are you?

677
01:11:28,195 --> 01:11:29,389
On the way to Bucharest.

678
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:31,128
Not any longer.

679
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,795
New coordinates:
3-7-13.

680
01:12:14,741 --> 01:12:16,504
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

681
01:12:17,177 --> 01:12:19,338
Sorry, just a minute.

682
01:12:19,546 --> 01:12:21,639
Inspector Tarconi,
from Marseilles.

683
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,514
Well, not exactly
Marseilles...

684
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:28,654
...but a small town to the east...
- What do you want, inspector?

685
01:12:28,855 --> 01:12:30,516
- A word with you.
- I have no time.

686
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:32,992
It's about your daughter.

687
01:12:41,268 --> 01:12:44,863
Odessa, Frank. My country.

688
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:48,633
You take me home. Thank you.

689
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:52,610
What happened to Bucharest?

690
01:12:54,214 --> 01:12:59,049
- Change of plans.
- It's a good change. I prefer Odessa.

691
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:01,311
Yeah.

692
01:13:02,255 --> 01:13:05,383
I was looking forward to that
fish with the carrots myself.

693
01:13:05,592 --> 01:13:07,583
Oh, it's much better here.

694
01:13:07,794 --> 01:13:10,888
- You know chicken Kiev?
- I do.

695
01:13:11,097 --> 01:13:13,292
I know restaurant here.

696
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,831
Best in the world.

697
01:13:15,035 --> 01:13:19,369
The chicken's so fresh. And the
butter, when it's coming out...

698
01:13:19,573 --> 01:13:21,700
Like you cannot
believe, it's so nice.

699
01:13:27,414 --> 01:13:29,848
You know what I feel like now?

700
01:13:32,519 --> 01:13:34,180
Hungry.

701
01:13:37,324 --> 01:13:39,053
Safe.

702
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:51,535
It's going to end up like the
movies, this happily ever after?

703
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,836
By tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.

704
01:13:58,311 --> 01:14:02,304
It's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken Kiev.

705
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:05,949
Liar.

706
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,163
<i>Mr. Minister, an
update, please.</i>

707
01:14:27,874 --> 01:14:32,311
I am ready to sign the contract
once I speak to my daughter.

708
01:14:34,147 --> 01:14:37,014
Hello? Hello?

709
01:14:37,584 --> 01:14:40,212
Have that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

710
01:14:48,862 --> 01:14:51,023
We are closing
the noose, Frank.

711
01:14:51,631 --> 01:14:54,964
Well, when it closes, make sure no
one tries to drag me out of the car.

712
01:14:55,168 --> 01:14:56,692
You know what
this is about yet?

713
01:14:57,937 --> 01:15:00,428
The girl. Her father.

714
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:03,299
Large amounts of toxic waste.

715
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:05,842
It is a trade. His
signature for her life.

716
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:10,640
I have a reputation to
uphold here, inspector.

717
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:14,081
One hundred percent
successful delivery rate.

718
01:15:14,287 --> 01:15:17,745
Am I detecting a
little attachment?

719
01:15:18,258 --> 01:15:23,525
That is not the Frank I know. With
his rules, no names, no attachment.

720
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,925
Why is everyone so
concerned about my rules?

721
01:15:26,633 --> 01:15:32,230
Frank, I always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.

722
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:35,196
Anything else?

723
01:15:36,409 --> 01:15:38,070
<i>Where is the rendezvous?</i>

724
01:15:38,278 --> 01:15:40,212
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

725
01:15:44,951 --> 01:15:47,579
- Yeah.
- We're almost at the end, Frank.

726
01:15:47,787 --> 01:15:50,347
- Just give me the coordinates.
- No more coordinates.

727
01:15:51,057 --> 01:15:53,048
The road you're on.

728
01:15:53,393 --> 01:15:54,724
Make your first left.

729
01:15:55,528 --> 01:15:57,018
I'd like to know
where I'm going.

730
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:04,269
You'll know when
you get there.

731
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,564
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

732
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:45,478
My compliments, Frank.

733
01:16:45,678 --> 01:16:49,307
Our trust in your
abilities was well deserved.

734
01:16:49,883 --> 01:16:51,646
<i>If you could please
send the girl out.</i>

735
01:16:53,353 --> 01:16:54,843
She's coming.

736
01:16:55,221 --> 01:16:57,314
I'm not coming.

737
01:16:58,024 --> 01:17:00,151
They need you.
They won't kill you.

738
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,692
But they will kill you.

739
01:17:03,196 --> 01:17:06,461
Do I look like a man who came halfway
across Europe to die on a bridge?

740
01:17:08,701 --> 01:17:09,690
Do I?

741
01:17:18,978 --> 01:17:21,446
We don't have all day, Frank.

742
01:17:25,285 --> 01:17:26,843
Look how many of them.

743
01:17:27,053 --> 01:17:28,987
They have all the guns.

744
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:30,349
How it's gonna be okay?

745
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:35,824
Tell you over dinner.

746
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:38,691
Now, go.

747
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:40,894
Go.

748
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,829
Kiss me.

749
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:01,209
Go.

750
01:18:06,092 --> 01:18:08,652
You're gonna get
me killed. Now, go.

751
01:18:33,353 --> 01:18:35,548
Get to her, you bastard.

752
01:19:00,914 --> 01:19:02,973
Better now, darling?

753
01:19:21,434 --> 01:19:22,924
Finish him.

754
01:19:42,455 --> 01:19:44,753
No! Frank!

755
01:19:56,035 --> 01:19:58,526
His beloved car
will be his grave.

756
01:19:58,738 --> 01:20:01,605
Leaves it, he blows. Stays, he
drowns. Let's get out of here.

757
01:20:12,852 --> 01:20:14,843
- Tarconi.
- They have the girl.

758
01:20:16,122 --> 01:20:19,558
Frank, we are trying to track
him through the phone signal.

759
01:20:19,759 --> 01:20:21,989
- Where are you?
- In a lake.

760
01:20:23,229 --> 01:20:24,856
A lake?

761
01:20:25,365 --> 01:20:27,230
Can you be more specific?

762
01:20:27,433 --> 01:20:28,695
There's a dam.

763
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:32,304
- A dam?
- I know the place, sir.

764
01:20:32,505 --> 01:20:34,302
- How far?
- Ten minutes at least.

765
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,371
Frank, we'll be
there in 10 minutes.

766
01:20:36,576 --> 01:20:37,873
Can you make it any faster?

767
01:20:38,344 --> 01:20:40,642
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you.

768
01:22:39,098 --> 01:22:40,588
Buy tickets for all of us.

769
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,599
Where to?

770
01:22:42,802 --> 01:22:46,738
Anywhere this train is going. We
need to keep moving for half an hour.

771
01:22:46,939 --> 01:22:48,873
Why don't we just
keep driving around?

772
01:22:54,514 --> 01:22:55,913
Another day.

773
01:23:10,429 --> 01:23:12,920
Sir! There!

774
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:34,279
- Out. Out!
- Everybody out!

775
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,919
- Come on.
- Move!

776
01:23:36,689 --> 01:23:38,213
Move, quick!

777
01:23:56,209 --> 01:23:57,870
- Mr. Minister?
- Yes.

778
01:23:58,511 --> 01:24:00,206
Someone wants to talk to you.

779
01:24:01,547 --> 01:24:04,209
- Papa.
- Are you all right?

780
01:24:08,788 --> 01:24:10,449
Don't sign.

781
01:24:11,157 --> 01:24:14,217
What you have is 15 minutes.

782
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,196
- You ever find out what this is about?
- Garbage.

783
01:24:24,403 --> 01:24:25,927
How much garbage
are we talking?

784
01:24:26,872 --> 01:24:30,433
Enough to pollute half the
country for a hundred years.

785
01:24:30,643 --> 01:24:31,632
Try it again.

786
01:24:52,365 --> 01:24:55,698
For a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.

787
01:24:55,968 --> 01:24:57,629
This is the new world.

788
01:24:58,804 --> 01:25:01,068
There are no more
countries. That's old think.

789
01:25:01,507 --> 01:25:04,874
There are just economic
realities. Profit and loss.

790
01:25:05,077 --> 01:25:07,807
Efficiency and waste.

791
01:25:08,014 --> 01:25:10,005
Think global, not local.

792
01:25:10,816 --> 01:25:12,750
Think this.

793
01:25:27,566 --> 01:25:29,534
- Yes?
- Where are we?

794
01:25:37,143 --> 01:25:38,633
We're almost there.

795
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,645
Where?

796
01:25:42,848 --> 01:25:44,873
Here. He is on a train.

797
01:25:45,518 --> 01:25:47,850
- And where are we?
- Here.

798
01:25:48,054 --> 01:25:50,249
We can get units there.

799
01:25:51,924 --> 01:25:53,721
That's a good idea. Do that.

800
01:25:57,697 --> 01:26:00,530
Oh, Frank, come on.

801
01:26:32,431 --> 01:26:34,991
Mr. Minister, I assure
you, everything is in order.

802
01:26:35,201 --> 01:26:37,066
I'm sure it is.

803
01:26:37,503 --> 01:26:41,337
- If there are any problems...
- I know you will solve them.

804
01:26:42,274 --> 01:26:44,174
Now, if you don't mind...

805
01:27:14,573 --> 01:27:18,100
You might not believe this,
but I am, at heart, a pacifist.

806
01:27:19,378 --> 01:27:21,437
I hate violence.

807
01:27:23,449 --> 01:27:26,247
It creates more
problems than it solves.

808
01:27:27,887 --> 01:27:30,720
You know, I never
wanted to do any of this.

809
01:27:32,224 --> 01:27:35,284
A client asked me
to obtain a result...

810
01:27:35,761 --> 01:27:37,854
...so I went about
creating an environment...

811
01:27:38,063 --> 01:27:39,826
...with the least
amount of bloodshed.

812
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:42,762
No one wanted to cooperate.
Not you, not the first driver...

813
01:27:42,968 --> 01:27:46,734
...not your father, not the
recently deceased Frank Martin.

814
01:27:47,873 --> 01:27:50,433
Everyone wanted to fight.

815
01:28:05,825 --> 01:28:07,019
What's so funny?

816
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:10,751
Hearing a dead man talking.

817
01:30:23,629 --> 01:30:25,563
One more step, Frank.

818
01:30:25,998 --> 01:30:27,522
Come on. One more.

819
01:31:11,143 --> 01:31:12,576
Look.

820
01:31:12,945 --> 01:31:13,969
It's over.

821
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,541
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

822
01:31:20,352 --> 01:31:22,445
Oh, my God.

823
01:31:27,726 --> 01:31:29,159
No, Frank. No, no.

824
01:32:10,169 --> 01:32:12,603
It's over, Frank. It's over.

825
01:32:13,872 --> 01:32:16,340
Mission accomplished. You
and the girl are free to go.

826
01:32:17,943 --> 01:32:20,275
Matter of fact, I'm so
impressed by your talent...

827
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:22,140
...I'd like to
offer you a position.

828
01:32:22,347 --> 01:32:25,646
I'd like to offer you
one. Permanently disabled.

829
01:32:44,937 --> 01:32:46,268
I hate to waste talent.

830
01:32:46,472 --> 01:32:48,770
But I really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.

831
01:32:48,974 --> 01:32:50,464
That's right.

832
01:33:14,266 --> 01:33:15,358
No!

833
01:33:19,304 --> 01:33:22,467
We wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.

834
01:33:27,045 --> 01:33:28,307
No, no.

835
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:40,649
No!

836
01:33:42,294 --> 01:33:43,522
No!

837
01:33:59,244 --> 01:34:01,109
You're doing the right thing.

838
01:34:20,966 --> 01:34:22,695
Valentina.

839
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,068
Valentina.

840
01:34:39,384 --> 01:34:41,511
Am I in heaven?

841
01:34:44,656 --> 01:34:46,920
Looks more like we're in hell.

842
01:34:47,426 --> 01:34:49,223
I don't care.

843
01:34:49,561 --> 01:34:51,222
As long as we're
there together.

844
01:35:03,575 --> 01:35:04,633
Yes?

845
01:35:04,843 --> 01:35:08,006
Mr. Minister, your
daughter is in good hands.

846
01:35:09,514 --> 01:35:11,106
Thank you.

847
01:35:25,631 --> 01:35:28,031
- What are you doing?
- What you said, the right thing.

848
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:31,464
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a conference to address...

849
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:34,605
...on the dangers of doing
business with people like you.

850
01:35:34,806 --> 01:35:35,795
Thank you very much.

851
01:35:54,993 --> 01:35:56,017
Is the launch ready?

852
01:35:56,228 --> 01:35:58,560
- It's on the water, sir, waiting.
- Time to leave.

853
01:35:59,298 --> 01:36:00,629
- Grab the log.
- Okay.

854
01:36:19,751 --> 01:36:22,618
I just don't understand it.

855
01:36:22,821 --> 01:36:24,789
When I was a boy,
my father and I...

856
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:28,323
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.

857
01:36:28,527 --> 01:36:30,154
Times change, inspector.

858
01:36:30,762 --> 01:36:32,491
As do people.

859
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,434
You referring to me?

860
01:36:39,004 --> 01:36:41,097
I don't think that's a
very accurate statement.

861
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,270
I drive the same car,
live in the same house.

862
01:36:44,476 --> 01:36:48,606
Oh, I was not referring
to your car or your house.

863
01:36:51,483 --> 01:36:53,849
The sea is so restful.

864
01:36:54,052 --> 01:36:55,212
Is lunch ready yet?

865
01:36:56,488 --> 01:36:59,787
Mademoiselle, there is a
certain progression to things.

866
01:36:59,992 --> 01:37:03,325
In order to eat the lunch, you
first have to catch the lunch.

867
01:37:03,528 --> 01:37:05,758
And if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...

868
01:37:05,964 --> 01:37:07,295
...we're gonna catch nothing.

869
01:37:07,499 --> 01:37:11,230
I have better idea. Why we
don't skip catching of lunch...

870
01:37:11,436 --> 01:37:13,370
...and go right
to eating of lunch?

871
01:37:13,572 --> 01:37:16,735
I know wonderful place
just up coast from here...

872
01:37:16,942 --> 01:37:19,843
...where they make
fish stew. Incredible.

873
01:37:20,045 --> 01:37:25,813
They use tomatoes and onions, and
little amount of wild lavender.

874
01:37:26,518 --> 01:37:28,418
What kind of wine?

875
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:30,349
Pink. From south.

876
01:37:31,656 --> 01:37:33,487
A Chteauneuf, perhaps.

877
01:37:33,959 --> 01:37:36,393
- Chilled.
- Of course, chilled.

878
01:37:36,595 --> 01:37:38,529
And for dessert?
