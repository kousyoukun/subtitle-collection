船队? Ships?

为了使这次冒险更具价值 In order to make the venture more profitable

290
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,600
我们需要增加份量 这样才会更有意义 we need to process the material in a volume that makes sense.

291
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,500
所说的船 到底有多少只? How many ships are we talking about?

292
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,400
加上在港口等待清关的 共八只 Plus the one in the port waiting on clearanceeight.

293
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,300
八只 Eight.

294
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,800
今年 This year.

295
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,100
保护环境并不能立竿见影 Protecting the environment is a long-term commitment.

296
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
你自己说的 没错吧? You've said so yourselfhaven't you?

297
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,000
我明天在敖德萨同样会说 And I will do again tomorrow in Odessa

298
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,100
这些东西到了那儿再签吧 where I will sign these.

299
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,900
我们真心希望今天就能解决这事儿 We were really hoping to settle this today.

300
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,400
我想再仔细看看 后面还有些附录 I want to review themnow that there are some addendums.

301
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,800
对这种长期承诺来说 Twenty-four hours doesn't make a difference

302
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,400
多二十四小时有何不同呢? on such a long-term commitmentwill it?

303
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,800
好吧 当然不会 Noof course not.

304
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
那么 明天敖德萨见 早上9点 Then I will see you tomorrow in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,300
好的 我等著 OkayI'll stay.

307
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,100
但是原料正在四处泄漏 然后呢? But the material is leaking everywhere. And?

308
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,900
我们隐瞒不下去了 我会处理的 再给我多点时间 We won't be able to hide it. I'll take care of itjust give me some time.

309
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,400
要是他们查起来... If ever they check...

310
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,900
别紧张 交易很快就会达成的 Easy. The deal will be closed very soon.

311
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,700
二十四小时 不能再拖了 Twenty-four hours. No more.

312
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,600
喂? 我为你们再争取了24小时 Yes? I've bought you another 24 hours.

313
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,100
到明天早上9点 You have until tomorrow9 a.m.

314
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,100
时间绰绰有余 That should be more than enough time.

315
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,600
有头绪了吗? Do you have a lead?

316
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
不止是有头绪 Better than a lead.

317
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400

我饿了 I'm hungry.

325
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,500
我们离啤酒和香肠还有100公里远 We're 100 kilometers from beer and sausage.

326
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,300
我不喜欢香肠 I don't like sausage.

349
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,600
偏离路线

350
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,800
他走错了道 He's gone off the reservation.

351
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,500
派人去教教他该怎么走 Send someone to get him back on.

352
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,100
别杀他 Don't kill him.

355
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,900
怎么没跟我说还带了女朋友来的啊 You didn't mention you bring company.

356
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
不是女朋友 It's not really company.

357
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,700
那个... It's...

358
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,000
有点复杂 complicated.

359

370
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,200
我可不知道你在五角大楼的极度机密的消息圈内 I didn't realize you were in the loop on the Pentagon hush-hush.

371
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
当你任由你的手指在互联网上漫步时 You wouldn't believe what you can discover

372
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,800
你所发现的东西 会让你觉得难以置信 when you left your fingers walking through the Internet.

373
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,300
你想看看入侵伊朗的计划书吗? You wanna see the invasion plans for Iran?

374
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,500
下次吧 Maybe some other time.

375
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,100
现在 我们得把这玩意儿弄下来 不然被轰到伊朗去的就是我了 Right now we need to get this thing off without blowing myself to Iran.

376
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,800
我不想拿细节来烦你 I don't wanna bother you with the details

377
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,500
但是 通常都会有个发射器在附近的 but usually there's a transmitter plate close by.

378
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,200
你不必这样做 You should not be doing this.

379
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
之前你不想说 现在你又来劝告 First you don't talknow you offer advice.

380
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,000
不是劝告 是警告 Not advice. A warning.

381
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
噢 你不认为警告来得有点迟了吗? Wella little late for warningsdon't you think?

382
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
我同意你 I agree with you.

男人就得跟他驾驶的车一样棒 这是职业经验 In my professiona man is only as good as the car he drives.

388
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,700
你照顾好车 车就会照顾好你 You take care of the carthe car will take care of you.

389
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,200
老板说 "回到路上" The boss says" Back on the road."

不 我是大家伙 No. I'm the big one.

397

398
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,200
找到了 Found it.

399
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,900
发射器 能拆下来么? The transmitter. Can you remove it?

400
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
有线连著 It's wired.

401
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,700
要是我拆了: 就爆了 If I do: it comes boom.

402
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,700
打得很漂亮 You fight good.

403
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,900
但领带打很烂 But your tie bad.

404
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
去哪儿? Where are you going?

405
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,800
累了 Tired.

406
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,200
那就是我更愿意与车相处的原因 That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

407
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,800
英雄所见略同 That makes two of us.

408
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,300
他们醒过来之后...? 醒了之后 我要怎么办? What do you want me to do when they? When they wake up?

409
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,500
或许今天先放个假 Probably best to take the rest of the day off.

410
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,000
我很不爽 I'm not amused.

411
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,100
要是你不死 你会更不爽 You'd be less amused if you ended up dead.

412
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,700
如果你想我死 我早就死了 你想让我活著 If you wanted me deadI'd be dead. You need me alive.

413
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,700
你想要我完成这个任务 我要说明一下 You want me to complete the jobI need some clarification.

414
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,400
我在听 I'm listening.

415
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,000
单独听 In person.

416
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,700
是单独听的 We've already done in person.

417
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,000
噢 显然我不满意 Wellnot to my satisfactionapparently.

418
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,600
现在 我是否满意是你首要关心的问题 Right nowmy satisfaction should be your main concern.

419
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,200
同一地点 一小时后 等我电话 Same place. One hour. Wait for my call.

420
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,200
喂? Hello?

421
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,300
你让我很失望 You've disappointed me.

422
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,600
你不是第一个 也不会是最后一个 You won't be the first and you won't be the last.

423
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,600
我告诉过你 我想一个人做这事儿 那没必要 你看... I told you I wanted to do this in person. That won't be necessary. You see...

424
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
在我们一开始的少许交谈后 since our little chat at the beginning

425
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,500
我就一直在想 其实我不需要找最优秀的人来做这种任务 I've been thinking I don't need the best for this mundane assignment.

426
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,900
任何持有驾照的白痴都能做到 Any idiot with a driver's license will do.

427
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,200
所以 引用伟大的美国人唐纳德・川普的话: So in the words of the great AmericanDonald Trump:

428
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,700
很抱歉 你被解雇了 I'm sorrybut you're fired.

429
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,100
你是谁? Who are you?

430
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,100
你的新司机 我要旧的那个 Your new chauffeur.  I want the old one back.

431
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,600
他就快被炸成肉酱了 He's about to go to pieces.

432
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,400
你被解雇了 You're fired.

433
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,300
睡得怎么样? How was your nap?

434
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,100
很安稳 你电话打得怎么了? Restful. How was your phone call?

435
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,700

是我 It's me.

438
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,800
我还在想你会什么时候打来呢 I was wondering when you would call.

439
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,200
我忙死了 I've been busy.

440
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,000
我来猜猜 在布达佩斯? Let me guess. In Budapest?

441

你也很忙嘛 You've been busy too.

442
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,000
用那种方式维系像你这样的朋友关系 不会有问题 弗兰克 Never a problem keeping that way with a friend like youFrank.

443

布达佩斯有一辆黑色的梅赛德斯 There is a black Mercedes also in Budapest.

445
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,900
或许并不归你的朋友所有 Probably not occupied by friends of yours.

446
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,700
我只知道那个 现在告诉我你知道的吧 That is what I know. Now tell me what you know.

447
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,900
我有两个包在后备箱 一个女孩在前座 I have two bags in the back and a girl in the front.

448
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,000
俄国人 我猜 RussianI think.

449
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,400
我不知道她跟这一切有什么关系 I don't know what she has to do with anything.

450
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,500
你试过问她吗? Have you tried asking her?

451
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,800
为什么我没有想到呢? 抱歉 Nowwhy didn't I think of that? Sorry.

452

你当然问过了 那她说什么? Of course you've asked. And she says?

453

我快死了 I'm going to die.

典型的 俄国人 Typical. Russians.

455
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,600
他们太抑郁了 They are so dark.

456
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,300
我还记得 在学校时 读著陀思托耶夫斯基 然后想 I rememberin schoolreading Dostoyevsky and thinking

457
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,100
这些人什么时候才会笑呢? when do these people laugh?

458
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,000
满满整页都写著 One page after the other

459

那是密码吗? Is that code?

462
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,500
不是 是他们给我们戴的像手镯一样的东西 Noit's some bracelet they accessorized us with.

463
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,000
如果我们离车太远 就会爆炸 Wired to explode if we get too far from the car.

464
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,200
他们? They?

465
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,900
是些美国人 Some American.

具体点呢? 姓名? 号码? Can you be more specific? A name? A number?

467
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
一无所知 Nothing.

468
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,600
你怎么总是不当回事 弗兰克? Why do you always make it so easyFrank?

469
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,500
天性使然 It's my nature.

470
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,600
你在哪儿? 我去找你 Where are you? I will come there.

471
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,200
这个想法可不怎么样 我们被看得很紧 That's not a good idea. They have me on a short leash.

472
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,300
要是你不告诉我点东西 我可帮不上什么忙 I can't be of much help if you do not give me something.

473
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,000
你身边有电脑么? How close are you to a computer?

474

被扔在市场上 感觉很不好啊 That wasn't very niceback there in the market.

476

我承认 Point well taken.

我们扯平了 我们重新来过怎么样? That makes us even. What say we start with a clean slate?

497
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,400
可是作为最后的晚餐 也不算太差 But for the last mealcould be worse.

498
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,200
你真该乐观一点儿 You really should begin to think more positive.

499
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,800
我是个现实主义者 I'm realist.

"悲观绝望"什么意思? What means "doom and gloom"?

502
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,600
你知道的 你只会看到恐惧和害怕 You knowyou only see the horrible and the terrible.

503
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,800
你的朋友 他凭什么这么说? 他又不认识我 Your friendwhere does he get this? He doesn't know me.

504
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,300
他只是大体上描述了一下 一个俄罗斯人 He was talking about you in general. Russiansas a people.

505
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,600

506
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,400
抱歉 Excuse me.

510
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,700

我只是想开心点儿 I want to have fun.

541
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,700
我想要开心点 你应该试著高兴点 而不是老这么严肃 I want to be happy. You should try happy instead of so serious.

不知道 我不在乎 I don't know. I don't care.

552
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,200
不介意小点儿声吧? 一开始你说我悲观绝望... You mind? First you say I'm doom and gloom...

的确 We do.

556
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,900
跟我身后的那辆车没有任何关系 It had nothing to do with a car on my ass.

557
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:41,000
我跟那一点关系也没有 是不是跟你有恩怨的人? I don't have anything to do with that. Someone else has issues with you?

558
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,000
可能吧 Likely.

559
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,100
我想是有其他势力在办事 What I think is that there are other forces at work here.

560
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,700
让我查一下 看看能不能找到什么 Let me check into itsee what I can find out.

开快点吧 Drive faster.

563
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,600

我饿啦 I'm hungry.

567
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,300
早该想到买块三明治 而不是伏特加 Should have thought about a sandwichnot vodka.

568
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,600
那儿! Look!

那会儿我不是饿 是渴 I wasn't hungry thenI was thirsty.

570
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,000
你为什么要那样针对我? Why you are so mean to me?

571
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,500
我不是针对 我才没这个心思 "没心思"是什么意思? I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied. What means "preoccupied"?

572
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,700
这就是没心思 That means preoccupied.

573
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,400
射轮胎! 快! 抓住他! Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

580
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,400
你太紧张了 You're so tense.

581
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,800
用不著你来说 You don't say.

582
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,000
我来给你放松放松 如何? I make you relaxokay?

583
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,200

01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,900
消除紧张 Making tense go away.

585
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,100
你干嘛呢? What are you doing?

586
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,100
我想在死之前 再一次感受性爱 I want to feel sex one more time before I die.

587
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,700
难道你不想吗? Don't you?

588
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,400
那跟你还有死 有什么关系? What is it with you and dying?

589
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,500
我有什么问题吗? There is something wrong with me?

590
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,400
难道我不够性感? Am I not sexy?

591
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,900
不是 你很性感 Yeahyou're sexy.

592
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
噢 你是同志 You're the gay.

593
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,500
不 我不是同志 NopeI am not the gay.

594
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,600
我不介意的 I don't mind.

595
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,100
我不是 好不好? I'm notokay?

596
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,200
那还有什么问题? Then what's the problem?

597
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,100
你有没有想到过 可能是我没心情? Did it ever occur to you that maybe I'm not in the mood?

598
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,000
我以为规则是 不能打开包裹 没错 I thought rule is don't open package. It is.

599
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,900
如果破坏了规矩 还要它干嘛? Why you have rules if you break them?

600
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,900
我也一直这样问我自己 I keep asking myself the same thing.

601
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,300
电话薄 Phone books.

602
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,200
你才是那个包裹 没错 You're the package. Yes.

603
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,600
为什么不早说 Could have said something.

604
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,700

你知道的 在停车场... You knowback in garage...

607
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,800
你脱掉衣服的时候 真是让人兴奋 it was very turn-on to me when you take off your clothes.

608
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,700
我当时正竭力不让那五个白痴抓住我们 I was trying to keep five cretins from caving my head in.

609
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,300
我可不觉得有什么好兴奋的 I don't see the turn-on in that.

610
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,600
你以为 只有男人才会被脱衣舞勾起欲望? You think it's only man gets turned on by striptease?

611
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,800
我可不喜欢事情变成这样 瓦伦蒂娜 I don't like where this is goingValentina.

612
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,000
你能为我再脱一次吗? Would you striptease for me again?

别闹了 这才是我想要的 I want you to stop playing aroundis what I want.

616
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,000
也许这是你我最后一次好好玩的机会了 Maybe it's last chance to play around for you and for me.

617
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,700
这不是玩的地方 现在也不是玩的时候 This is not the time or the place for playing.

618
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,900
那为什么我会在此时此刻 对你有感觉呢? Why do I get feeling with you it's never time or place?

619
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,500
如果我需要分析 我会去找心理医生 If I wanna get analyzedI'll see a psychiatrist.

把我绑起来? 你会喜欢的 不是吗? Tie me up? You'd like thatwouldn't you?

633
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,300
我喜欢粗暴型的 I like the rough stuff.

634
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,700
真的吗? Really?

635
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,800
哦 但别太粗暴了 Ohbut not too rough.

636
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,200
交易是脱衣舞换钥匙 Deal was a striptease for the keys.

637
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,800

你有真心吻过一个人么 弗兰克? Do you ever kiss like you mean itFrank?

640

我想也许没有 I'm thinking maybe not.

641
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,200
我猜 你是一个人住的 I'm thinking you live alone.

642
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
不论在家还是在外 Inside and outside.

643
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,900
我想 你并不惧怕死亡 Thinking it is not dying you're afraid of.

644
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,000
而是惧怕生活 It's living.

645
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,800
跟我一起生活吧 Live with me.

646
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,800

他的位置在哪? 我们跟丢了 What's his position? We lost him.

649
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,700
他进了山区 我们接收不到那里的信号 He headed into the mountains. We can't get reception up there.

650

你觉得我们是在玩游戏吗 部长先生? You think we're playing games hereMr Minister?

653
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,100
我不知道你在说什么 I don't know what you're talking about.

654
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,700
我在说一辆载著你无能手下的黑色轿车 I'm talking about a black car full of your incompetent operatives.

655
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,900
再有这样的动作 你就再也别想见到你女儿 One more move like that and you will never see your daughter again.

656
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,500
我想听听她的声音 I want to hear her voice.

657
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,400
等合约签好传过来之后吧 When the contract is signed and delivered.

658
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,000
听不到她的声音 我是不会签的 I will not sign until I hear her voice.

659
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,800
你没有强硬的资格 部长先生 You are in no position to play hardballMr Minister.

660
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,600
那好 你也没有 Johnson先生 Wellneither are youMr Johnson.

我敢保证 如果我女儿有什么闪失... And I can assure youif anything happens to my daughter...

663
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,000
我会动用我所有的权力 I will use all the power I have.

664
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:45,600
抓住你 让你用最可怕的方式来偿还 I will hunt you down and make you pay in a most hideous way for this.

665
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,200
开始行动 We have to move now.

666
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,100
接啊 弗兰克 快接 Pick upFrank. Pick up.

667
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,800
我正在伊比沙岛 度假 I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

668
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,400
有人递给我一杯香槟 Someone hands me glass of champagne.

669
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,400
我喝了 I drink.

670
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,600
然后觉得有点儿不舒服 Then I don't feel so good.

671
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,700
我去了洗手间 之后的事儿我就不知道了 等我醒来时 就在这车上了 I go to bathroomand next thingI'm awake in the car.

672
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,700
我问他 "这是哪儿?" 他说他只是个送货的 I ask him"Where is this?" He tells me he's just a transporter.

673
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,900
他的车开得很棒 He's pretty good driver.

674
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,000
当然 没有你棒 Not like you good.

675
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:07,900
我告诉他 "求你了 我父亲是个有权有势的人 I tell him"Please. My father a really powerful man.

676
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,500
很有影响力 认识很多人 让我给他打个电话吧" Big influence. Knows a lot of people. Let me call him."

677
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,200
他很害怕 他以前从没这样做过 He's afraid. He's never done this before.

678
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,600
本来应该很简单的 载人 离开 来钱很容易 It's supposed to be simple. Pick updrop off. Easy money.

679
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,100
有人告诉他 不能打电话 不能离开车 He's been told no callsnever leave car.

680
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,500
但我说服了他 But I convince him.

681
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,000
我打了电话 I call.

682
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,900
但我还没来得及跟父亲说上话... But before I say to my father where we are...

683
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,400
上车 快! Inside the car. Come on!

684
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,800
我们逃走了 但... We get awaybut...

685
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,600
有人朝我们开枪 为什么? There's people shooting at us. Why?

686
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,000
他们为什么要杀我们呢? Why they shooting at us?

687
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:56,100
他说他们开枪 是因为我们没有遵造计划 He says they shoot because we didn't go according to plan.

688
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,900
我说 "好吧 那是旧计划 新的计划呢?" I said"Okaythat's the old plan. What's new plan?"

689
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,400
他说他有一个朋友 He says he has a friend.

690
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,600
之后我就遇到了你 And then I met you.

691
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,100
见到你 我就觉得安全了 And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

692
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,900
你甚至都不认识我 You didn't even know me.

693
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,100
我当然不认识你 Of course I don't know you.

694
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,800
我说的是感觉 不是认不认识 I talk about feelingsnot knowing.

695
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:39,200
如果你有那种感觉 你表达的方式真是有趣 Wellif you was feeling that wayyou sure had a funny way of showing it.

696
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,600
对女人来说 有一点神秘感会更好 Better for a woman to have a little mystery to her.

697
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,300
不是吗? No?

你肯定不敢相信 会有多美味 Like you cannot believeit's so nice.

724

感觉安全 Safe.

727
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,200
这会像电影的结局那样吗 从此过著幸福快乐的生活? It's going to end up like the moviesthis happily ever after?

728
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,500
今晚 这一切都将成为褪色的回忆 By tonightthis is all gonna be a fading memory.

729
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
你跟我微笑著坐在基辅鸡店里 It's gonna be you and melaughing over chicken Kiev.

730
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,600
骗子 Liar.

731
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,900
部长先生 决定做好了吧 Mr. Ministeran updateplease.

733
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,700

01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,000
和大量的有毒废料 Large amounts of toxic waste.

740
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,500
这是一场交易 他的签名换她的命 It is a trade. His signature for her life.

741
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,300
我有我的信誉 警长 I have a reputation to uphold hereinspector.

742
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,800
完成送货任务率是百分之百 One hundred percent successful delivery rate.

743
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,400
我好像听出来点儿什么苗头? Am I detecting a little attachment?

744
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,200
那不是我所认识的弗兰克 他的规则是 不问姓名 不牵涉感情 That is not the Frank I know. With his rulesno namesno attachment.

745
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,600
为什么每个人都对我的规则那么感兴趣? Why is everyone so concerned about my rules?

746
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:31,900
弗兰克 我一直认为 其实你的内心是浪漫的 FrankI always suspected you are a romantic at heart.

747
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,900
还有别的事儿吗? Anything else?

748
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,800

753
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,400
第一个路口左拐 Make your first left.

754
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,700
我想知道我要去哪儿 I'd like to know where I'm going.

755
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,000
到了你就知道了 You'll know when you get there.

756
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,300
不要担心 这地方正是我想带他们来的 Don't worry. We got them right where we want them.

757
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,200
我很欣赏你 弗兰克 My complimentsFrank.

758

你的能力果然值得我们信任 Our trust in your abilities was well deserved.

759
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,300
现在你可以让那女孩出来了 Now if you could please send the girl out.

760
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,500
她马上出去 She's coming.

761
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,000
我不走 I'm not coming.

762
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,900
他们需要你 他们不会杀你的 They need you. They won't kill you.

763
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,400
但他们会杀你 But they will kill you.

764
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,200
难道我看上去像那种穿越半个欧洲 然后死在桥上的人吗? Do I look like a man who came halfway across Europe to die on a bridge?

765
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,400
我像吗? Do I?

766
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,100
我们可没有这么多耐心 弗兰克 We don't have all dayFrank.

他们有那么多人 Look how many of them.

不! 弗兰克! No! Frank!

780
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,200
他的爱车将成为他的坟墓 His beloved car will be his grave.

781
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,300
爬出来 他会被炸死 留里面 他会被淹死 我们撤吧 Leaves ithe blows. Stayshe drowns. Let's get out of here.

不管这车去哪儿 我们得继续走半个小时 Anywhere this train is going. We need to keep moving for half an hour.

796
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,600
为什么我们不继续开车走呢? Why don't we just keep driving around?

797
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,600
改日再算 Another day.

足够污染半个国家一百年的废料 Enough to pollute half the country for a hundred years.

810
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,300
再试一次 Try it again.

这是个新世界 This is the new world.

813
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,800
不再有国家 那是旧的观念 There are no more countries. That's old think.

814
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,600
只有现实的经济利益 赢利和亏损 There are just economic realities. Profit and loss.

815
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,500
效率和浪费 Efficiency and waste.

816
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,700
放眼全球 不再有地域之分 Think globalnot local.

817
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,500

831
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,100
我讨厌暴力 I hate violence.

832
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,900
暴力造成的问题比能解决的要多 It creates more problems than it solves.

833
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,400
现在的一切 也并不是我所愿意的 You knowI never wanted to do any of this.

834
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:35,000
客户提出了要求... A client asked me to obtain a result...

835
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,600
但我想用最少的血... so I went about creating an environment...

可是没有人愿意合作 你不想 第一个司机不想... No one wanted to cooperate. Not younot the first driver...

838
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:46,400
你父亲不想 刚死掉的弗兰克马丁也不想 not your fathernot the recently deceased Frank Martin.

839
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,100
每个人都想反抗 Everyone wanted to fight.

840
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,700
有什么好笑的? What's so funny?

841
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,500
听一个死人说话 Hearing a dead man talking.

事实上 你的能力让我印象深刻... Matter of factI'm so impressed by your talent...

01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,500
但我真的不觉得我们合得来 But I really don't think we'd make a very good fit.

不要! No!

858
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,200
我们是不合适 但你和手镯炸弹是天生一对 We wouldn't fitbut you and the bracelet were made for each other.

看起来更像是地狱 Looks more like we're in hell.
