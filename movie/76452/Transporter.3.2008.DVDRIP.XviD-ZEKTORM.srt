00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:40,619
91, 92, it's down there.
- And if they catch us?

3
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:45,016
There's a million bottle of booze in there .
Do you think they gonna miss one bottle?

4
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,927
The weather is with us, sir.

5
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,308
We arrive in port in couple of hours.

6
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:08,117
Very good.
- You're welcome, sir.

7
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:16,709
Oh man, I’ve never smelled anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

8
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:20,048
Or what?
Your shit smells like rose?

9
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:22,011
Look.

10
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:24,323
Come here.

11
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,041
I thought you said it was booze?
- It was at the papers.

12
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:40,531
Captain, we have breach in lower level.
Look.

13
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:43,182
Which section?
- 101

14
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,655
Take the wheel!
- Yes, sir.Fuck!

15
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,520
Guns and load!.
- Get the mask.

16
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,645
Holy shits.
- Take care of 'em.

17
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:43,389
Hello.

18
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,451
Morning.
- Passport, please.

19
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,828
Rough sea?
- The sea was smooth,

20
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:56,281
the party was a bit rough,
If you know what I mean.

21
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:59,006
Ibiza.
- Yeah,thanks.

22
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:10,223
When I was a kid, my father used to take
me fishing.

23
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:13,787
Never could figure out how he knew
where the fish were.

24
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,562
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

25
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,133
Security check.

26
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,196
Do we look like a security risk?

27
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,828
Please step out of the car and bring your documents to the office.

28
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:53,816
My documents right here, sir.
- The computer "is" in the office.

29
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:56,686
Her too.
- She's sleeping.

30
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:01,127
With her documents.
- Okay, sure.

31
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:07,699
I think I bite.

32
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:16,735
Come on, you're gonna lose it.

33
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:22,429
Little closer, inspector,
little closer.

34
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:29,044
That's a big one!
go left, go left.

35
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,529
Don't let him go,
don't let him get away.

36
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:39,066
Getting closer!
[Laughing]

37
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:45,905
Go left, go left, go right!.

38
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:50,734
[Speaking foreign language]
do you need some help?

39
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,797
No, thank you.

40
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:57,525
I have been fishing in this water
since before you were born.

41
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:04,502
You're close inspector,
you're close.

42
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:11,620
You're gonna thing that we French had set
such a highly developed sense of humour.

43
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,959
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

44
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:17,283
Jerry Lewis is a genius.

45
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:18,828
Dean was a genius.
- No.

46
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,440
Dean just stood there with a drink
and a cigarette.

47
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:24,157
My point exactly, everyone
can fall down and get a laugh.

48
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:27,826
But how many people can do it, standing still
with a drink and a cigarette?

49
00:06:38,122 --> 00:06:41,769
I'm afraid our there pleasure is
cut short.

50
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:47,304
There's a big mess in Marseille, some madman
driving an Audi at impossible speed.

51
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,478
Don't look at me.

52
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:53,554
This is the first place
chief told me to look.

53
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,651
But I will tell him you're
the perfect alibi.

54
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,017
As usual.

55
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:08,791
Tacorni.

56
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,265
Please!
- I'm sorry.

57
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,941
This is my first bite!.
- Yeah,yeah.

58
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,045
Please!.
- Yeah.

59
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,638
Stop the boat, come on!.
- No.

60
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:21,681
Come on,
Please!

61
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:02,660
What is the purpose of your visit,
Mr. Johnson?

62
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:06,261
Business.
- What kind of business?

63
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:09,540
Environmental protection.

64
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:17,149
Go.
- Thank you!

65
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:22,009
Mr Minister, the giving the opportunity dressed at the EU
conference

66
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:24,233
of environmental impact of on distribute
out of such mobile.

67
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,297
What is top in your list of priorities?

68
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,832
It is a short list with only one item:
" the environment and how to protect it. "

69
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,419
In the phase of increasing pressure for industries

70
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:34,643
to compete successful in global economy,

71
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,375
is that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities?

72
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,454
Not as harsh as a polluted
and inhabitable planet.

73
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:44,366
But gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now,
I have trees to save,

74
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:47,888
and industrialists to disappoint.

75
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:52,354
Your speech for tomorrow.
- Any good?

76
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:56,378
It's going to piss off a lot of people.
- Excellent.

77
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:02,091
Confidential.

78
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:20,280
Hello?

79
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:23,280
Mr. Minister.

80
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,502
Who is this?

81
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,956
My name is not important.

82
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,737
I have been put in charge with the negotiations
you are engage in with EGO Corp,

83
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,075
They should've a license
to do business in Ukraine.

84
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,760
You must be misinform mister,
of whatever your name is.

85
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:40,020
I've terminated the negotiations,
permanently.

86
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:47,173
I think you will reconsider that position once you have a
chance to study the documents in the envelope.

87
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,949
I'll be in touch.

88
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:44,412
Yes, there's been an accident.

89
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:46,014
Send an ambulance.

90
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:49,402
Track this phone.

91
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:06,637
Malcolm!

92
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:10,523
Malcolm!

93
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:16,852
I asked you for a price.
What is this?

94
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:19,209
I might not be interested
in taking the job.

95
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:21,305
This not well.

96
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,089
My boss said you're
the man for the job.

97
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:26,355
Your boss gets his facts wrong.

98
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:28,832
Two things
you should know about my boss.

99
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,504
He never gets his facts wrong,

100
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:32,369
He never takes 'no' for an answer.

101
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:35,529
Well, there’s a first time for everything.

102
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:46,237
Well, not this time.

103
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:53,659
You don't wanna do this.

104
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:57,849
I don't think you're in a position
to tell me what I do, and what I don't wanna do.

105
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:01,070
You have ten seconds
to change your mind.

106
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:08,964
I give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

107
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:07,056
Malcolm!.

108
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,380
Malcolm!, can you hear me?

109
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:13,837
I said drop in anytime,
but I don't mean..

110
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:17,988
I had nowhere else to go.
- Just take it easy okay.

111
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,566
Get me away from the car.

112
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:23,769
Just to make you to be comfortable until the end of this..
- I don't want any ambulance.

113
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:28,137
You're gonna need a doctor.
You've been shot.

114
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,231
Not far from car!.

115
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,078
Relax.

116
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,041
Just stay calm.

117
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:39,099
You'll be fix up in no time.

118
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,276
He's inside.
Quick, it's serious.

119
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:56,840
Sir.

120
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:59,953
You wanna be careful removing him.
- Sir, we know our job, okay?

121
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:02,532
Sir, can you hear me?

122
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:04,111
The car ... No ...

123
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:05,849
If you hear me,
press my hand.

124
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,315
The car.

125
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:58,233
Am I in heaven?

126
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:00,839
Actually, you're in the bit of a shit.

127
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:03,767
You help me out of it?

128
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:05,915
That depends on how deep you're in.

129
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,717
Don't trust anyone.

130
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:10,153
Couldn't agree with you more.

131
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,891
Come on.
- No, don't leave the car.

132
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,054
What's so special
about the car?

133
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:18,082
Not the car ...

134
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,710
Wait!

135
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:00,075
I told you.

136
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:04,297
Don't trust anyone.

137
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:07,968
I told you.

138
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,011
I took the liberty
of bringing you the suit.

139
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:00,845
Especially when you're working, correct?

140
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:04,451
Correct,
but I'm not working.

141
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:06,445
You see boss, I told you.

142
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:12,046
Please Josh, your purchase is not very effective in
presenting our proposal for the first time.

143
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,289
Thank you.

144
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,386
As I were saying.
We came to you in good faith.

145
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,659
You said you were unavailable.

146
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:22,855
We contacted with the man whose the number
you gave us, and it proved to be uneffective,

147
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,196
And now, I'm left with unfinished business.

148
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,881
The way I see it,
your responsible.

149
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,109
I understand your point of view.

150
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:34,189
But I'm still unavailable.

151
00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:36,894
Boss, can I say something?

152
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:41,215
Anyone else wanna say something?

153
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:44,996
Good.

154
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,930
Find me a smarter one.

155
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,806
You have three seconds to change your mind or
you're gonna be permanently unavailable.

156
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,261
One,

157
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,090
two ...

158
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,316
One condition.

159
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,708
I'm listening.

160
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,802
I drive my own car.

161
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,552
Deal.

162
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:20,368
In anticipation of your answer, we took the liberty
of bringing you a car lock.

163
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:24,299
Changed the oil, give it a tune up and
took out all the non-essential material.

164
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,737
Left the switch over licence plate, of them.

165
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:30,915
Replaced the GPS with one of
our own,pre-programme.

166
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,077
It's more efficient that way.

167
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:37,253
I was so insisted of using the best man
for this assignment.

168
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:41,297
We're playing a much larger game here.

169
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:46,125
Don't think of this as just another job,
think of it as a mission.

170
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,763
I'm so please to find we share the same
approach to our..

171
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,761
I make a deal
and that's the deal, just like you.

172
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:55,676
You don't like names, neither do I,
besides ...

173
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,819
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we paid to do,

174
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,590
beyond what we are paid to do.

175
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,225
Those are your rules, right?

176
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:12,511
You forgot one.

177
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,148
I work alone.

178
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:15,917
I thought you
might like the company.

179
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,635
I thought you wanted
me to complete the mission?

180
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,175
You're right, I do.

181
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:27,595
Wait!

182
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:31,034
What?
You wanna change the rules?

183
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:35,389
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

184
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:39,289
You're the boss.

185
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:42,938
Anything else?

186
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:46,660
The jewellery,
anything I should know?

187
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:51,094
Remember those joggers you're trying to blow up
in the airliners

188
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:53,942
by sneaking liquids through security and combining them onboard?

189
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,105
Same principle,
just refined.

190
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:59,053
25 feet from the car,
yellow light comes on,

191
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:01,214
Signal the first liquid
is ready.

192
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,637
50 feet, orange, second liquid
flows into the chamber.

193
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,940
75-feet, you're gonna see red.

194
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,561
Time to go.

195
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:19,574
This phone is programmed
to call only one number, Mine!

196
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:22,880
When you pass the first toll on the road going north,

197
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:25,089
Call me,
All right?

198
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:28,235
Money, for gas and food.

199
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,610
Any other questions?

200
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:02,940
Would you mind buckling your seat belt?

201
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,314
I suppose you want to tell me
what's this all about.

202
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:23,304
Great.

203
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:41,387
Ocean Blue requesting cargo clearance.

204
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:46,276
The papers of the environmental agency.
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

205
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:50,196
We'll inform you when they are signed.
- Okay.

206
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,808
I know what has happened to you
but what happened to Frank?

207
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,290
Colonel Medved All of Intelligence,
has been given all of the information’s.

208
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,930
He knows it is his priority.

209
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:16,514
He wanted you to know
he hires his best man in it.

210
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,036
He'll keep in touch for such short notice.

211
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:22,686
He suggests you buy him as much time
as you can.

212
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:33,921
Inspector, they ask if the car
can go through investigations?

213
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:38,135
Tell them to start.
I'll be there when I'm ready.

214
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,493
You can start.

215
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,731
Asshole.

216
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:48,429
Come on.

217
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:52,555
I am the police.

218
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:18,711
Look, I don't know whether you're part of this
or isn't..

219
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:20,612
and I don't really care.

220
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:22,438
But since you're here first,
you know more than I do,

221
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:24,640
So how about you telling me what you know?

222
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:28,918
I know nothing.
- How did you know Malcolm?

223
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:30,601
I didn't.

224
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:34,751
Just happen to be in a car
with a man you don't know?

225
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:38,670
I'm now in a car
with a man I don't know.

226
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:42,114
Aren't you suppose to make a call?

227
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,205
Nice to hear from you.

228
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:52,544
Skip the pleasant please and just
give me the code.

229
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:55,875
One, one, two, six.

230
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:01,467
Call me when you arrive.

231
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,730
What's in Budapest?.

232
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:07,694
Goulash, beer.

233
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:18,421
Let's be reminded to the beginning,
start with a proper introduction.

234
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,777
What happened to the rule
'no names'?

235
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:24,270
I suspending that rule for the moment.

236
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:30,551
I'm Frank Martin.

237
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,128
And your name is?

238
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:38,467
What matters my name?

239
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:41,839
Well, we are in the situation together.

240
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:44,477
No.

241
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:50,355
We sitting here in a car with two exploding bracelets on our wrist
under the same place,

242
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,812
I'll call that being in the same situation.

243
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:56,761
It's not,
they're going to kill you.

244
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:59,710
I'm aware of that.

245
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,931
And no probability, after they killed me,
you're next on the list.

246
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:06,599
Now, if you're gonna keep that from happening,
I’m gonna need a little help.

247
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:09,351
From the top ...
We have this problem.

248
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:11,775
You think I don't know
what's the problem?

249
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:14,427
I look stupid to you.

250
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:17,167
I didn't say you're stupid.

251
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:20,829
But we have a problem,
and it gonna be very helpful

252
00:25:20,914 --> 00:25:24,030
in participating for the solution of it.

253
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:27,709
I don't want to talk more.

254
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:36,423
Fine.

255
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,817
What did you say your name was?

256
00:25:50,903 --> 00:25:54,466
Frank,
Frank Martin.

257
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:59,642
My turn.
Valentina.

258
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:04,565
Pleased to meet ya.

259
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,570
Inspector.
There is no GPS anymore.

260
00:26:47,664 --> 00:26:51,987
Inspector?
- Yes, there is no GPS anymore. I know.

261
00:26:58,168 --> 00:27:01,645
The gentlemen from EGO Corp, are here.

262
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,074
Show them in.

263
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:13,337
Gentlemen.

264
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:20,232
Mr. Minister, we like to thank you for reconsidering our proposal
on such short notice.

265
00:27:20,316 --> 00:27:22,525
You make it very hard not to.
- Well, yes,

266
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,424
We do have a reputation of not taking 'no'
as an answer.

267
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,157
Here are the contracts.

268
00:27:29,787 --> 00:27:31,374
All in order.

269
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:33,431
We were told the ship cannot be cleared unless
you personally sign off on that.

270
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:35,799
unless you personally those documents
signing.

271
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:38,977
Ships?
I thought there was only one.

272
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:43,737
Oh well, here’s the thing.
In order to make the venture more profitable,

273
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,204
we need to be able to process the material in a
volume that makes sense.

274
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:49,369
How many ships are we talking about?

275
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:53,596
Less in the port waiting for clearance, eight.

276
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,072
Eight?

277
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,336
This year.

278
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,480
Protecting the environment is long-term commitment,

279
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:02,577
You said so yourself, haven’t you?

280
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:08,870
And I will do again tomorrow in Odessa,
where I will sign this.

281
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,493
We were really hoping
to settle this today.

282
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:15,916
I want to review them,
now there are some redundancy.

283
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,227
24 hours doesn't make much of a difference,
for such a long-term commitment, will it?

284
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:24,373
No, of course not.

285
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:27,061
And I will see you tomorrow, in Odessa.

286
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:30,358
Let say 09.00 A.M

287
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:36,492
Yes?
-Okay, I’ll stay.

288
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:38,663
but the materials are leaking everywhere.
- And?

289
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:40,835
We won't be able to hide them.
-I'll take care of that,

290
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,794
Just give me some time.
- If ever they check ...

291
00:28:42,878 --> 00:28:48,533
Easy, the deal will be closed very soon.
- 24 hours, no more.

292
00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:59,541
Yes?
- I've bought you another 24 hours.

293
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:02,099
You have until tomorrow, 09:00 AM.

294
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:04,229
That should be more than enough time.

295
00:29:04,314 --> 00:29:08,425
Did you have a lead?
- Even better than a lead,

296
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,319
A location.

297
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:12,862
Budapest
600 Km.

298
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,927
Inspector?
- Yes.

299
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:25,219
Interpol has your answer to the plate questioned.

300
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:31,204
This was flashed by the radar
towards the north.

301
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:33,237
Show them immediately
to our friends in Germany.

302
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:35,397
Yes, but what should I say?

303
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,932
What do you think?
What they expect from us?

304
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:49,054
I'm hungry.

305
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:52,494
We 100 kilometres from beers and sausage.

306
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:55,835
I don't like sausage.

307
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:00,854
What'd you like?

308
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:10,345
Chicken, roast with carrots
and bits.

309
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:13,746
and gravy with Mediterranean stock.

310
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,487
Under the stock?

311
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,926
A salad,

312
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:26,170
Rinced,toast with balsamiek from Medina.

313
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:27,711
Aged?

314
00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:30,550
Of course aged.

315
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:35,511
And for dessert?

316
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:37,772
Chocolate cake.

317
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:40,994
With whipped cream or without?

318
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,377
With.

319
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:46,305
To drink?

320
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,326
Wine.

321
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,652
Torquase perhaps?

322
00:30:50,737 --> 00:30:52,717
Iced wine.

323
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:55,097
Of course.

324
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:05,194
Wrong direction.

325
00:31:05,685 --> 00:31:06,976
What are you doing?

326
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,108
I'm gonna see a man about
some jewellery.

327
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:23,215
He's get off the reservation.

328
00:31:23,678 --> 00:31:27,331
Send someone to get him back on,

329
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:30,262
Don't kill him.

330
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:57,845
Frank, it's so good
to see you, my friend.

331
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:00,041
Good to see you too, Otto.

332
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,056
Oh,you didn't mention you bring company.

333
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:05,021
It's not really company.

334
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:07,186
It's ...

335
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,626
complicated.
- With you it's always complicated.

336
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,924
But you can tell me about it,
over a nice schnitzel with cut off salad I’ve prepared.

337
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:18,232
Hey Otto, you know
I love your schnitzel but ...

338
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:21,378
I'm gonna need to get rid of this fast.

339
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:23,150
Wonder Good.

340
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:26,753
Binary Freeform Magnetic Resolution Technology.

341
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:28,849
English please, Otto.

342
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:34,552
There's a program that Pentagon has funded
through one of their subsidiary front companies

343
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:37,896
They has been experimenting with this
new kind of weaponry.

344
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:40,781
Based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

345
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:44,273
Very 'hash' 'hash' stuff.

346
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,335
I realize you can give a loop on that
Pentagon 'hash' 'hash'.

347
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:51,761
You wouldn't believe what you can discover when you let your
fingers do the walking through the Internet.

348
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:56,382
You want to see the invasion plans for Iran?
- Maybe some other time.

349
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:59,824
But now I need to figure it out how to take this thing
off without blowing myself to Iran.

350
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:02,086
I don't wanna bother you
with the details..

351
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:06,690
But usually there's
a transmitted plate close by.

352
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,409
You should not be doing this.

353
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,441
First, you don't talk.
and now you offering an advice.

354
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:19,129
Not advice,
A warning.

355
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:22,798
A little late for one of those,
you think?

356
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:30,120
I'm agree with you.

357
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:35,335
You, of course.

358
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:43,754
Should I?
- Yes, you should.

359
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:50,693
Look, fellas ...

360
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:54,526
Somethings in the car were a bit off,
need a check in.

361
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,281
In my profession, the man is only as good
as the car he drives.

362
00:33:57,365 --> 00:34:01,331
If you take care of the car,
the car takes care of you.

363
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:05,181
The boss says;
'back on the road. "

364
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:07,407
Frank.

365
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,487
Keep at it.

366
00:34:10,837 --> 00:34:12,552
Back in the car, Frank.

367
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:14,870
Nope.

368
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:23,776
Find it?

369
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,385
Not yet.

370
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:39,751
Are you the small one?

371
00:36:39,835 --> 00:36:42,977
No, I'm the big one.

372
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,701
You should be getting more, are you?

373
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:57,904
Found it.

374
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,551
The transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

375
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:10,969
It's wired.
If I do that, 'kaboom'.

376
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:07,452
You fight good.

377
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:12,280
But your tie bad.

378
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:20,634
Where are you going?
- I'm tired.

379
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:24,091
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

380
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,154
Makes two of us.

381
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,302
What do you want me to do,
when they wake up?

382
00:39:29,387 --> 00:39:32,820
It'll be best to tell the rest,
the day's off.

383
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:51,230
I'm not amuse.

384
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:53,295
You'll be less amuse if you end up dead,

385
00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:55,784
If you want me dead, I’ll be dead,
if you need me alive..

386
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:57,448
but if you want me to stay alive and
play the job,

387
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:59,916
i'm gonna need some clarifications.

388
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,259
I'm listening.

389
00:40:01,343 --> 00:40:04,404
In person.
- We've already done in person.

390
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,061
Not to my satisfaction, apparently.

391
00:40:07,146 --> 00:40:10,798
Right now my satisfaction should
be your main concern.

392
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:14,816
Same place, one hour.
Wait for my call.

393
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,235
Hello.

394
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,104
You've disappointed me.

395
00:41:11,188 --> 00:41:14,328
It won't be the first and it
won't be the last.

396
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,251
I told you I wanna do this in person.

397
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:19,002
That won't be necessary, you see...

398
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:22,053
Since we had a little chat at the beginning of the mission..
I've been thinking,

399
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:25,004
We don't need the best man
for this demanding assignment.

400
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:27,265
Any idiot with a driver's license
would do.

401
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,214
So, in the words of great American, Donald Trump:

402
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:33,578
"Im sorry,
but you're fired. "

403
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:20,787
Who are you?
- The new driver.

404
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,509
I liked the other better.
- He had to agree.

405
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:44,111
I tell you to stop!

406
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:32,686
You're fired.

407
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:37,155
How was your nap?
- Restful.

408
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,712
How was your phone call?
- Reefed

409
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:42,453
Fasten your seat belt.

410
00:43:52,285 --> 00:43:55,345
Tarconi.
- It's me.

411
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,690
I was wondering when you'll call.
- I've been busy.

412
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:02,396
Let me guess.
In Budapest?

413
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,261
You've been busy too.

414
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:07,112
Never underestimate your old friend, Frank.

415
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:09,536
So you don't have to be redundant,
Tell me what you know.

416
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:14,548
There is a black Mercedes with some Budapest
probably not your cheap driver's friend of furious.

417
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:18,052
That is what I know
Now tell me what you know.

418
00:44:18,137 --> 00:44:21,687
I have 2 bags in the back
and a girl on the front.

419
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,652
Russian, I think.

420
00:44:23,737 --> 00:44:25,882
I don't know whether she has to do with anything.

421
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:27,451
Have you tried
asking her?

422
00:44:27,535 --> 00:44:29,353
Why didn't I think of that?

423
00:44:29,437 --> 00:44:32,463
Sorry, of course you've asked.
And she say?

424
00:44:32,547 --> 00:44:33,742
I'm going to die.

425
00:44:33,827 --> 00:44:36,328
Typical, Russians.

426
00:44:36,411 --> 00:44:38,457
They are so dark.

427
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:41,898
I remember at school
reading Dostoyevsky and thinking..

428
00:44:41,981 --> 00:44:44,747
"When do this people love?"

429
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:49,661
One page after the other, misery and suffering.
Like you won't believe, Frank.

430
00:44:49,744 --> 00:44:52,019
Inspector, skip the literature lesson for another time,
I'm blank in here.

431
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:54,998
- Is that good?

432
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:58,536
No, it's some bracelet I may access or rises with.

433
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,059
They'll explode it if we get too far from the car.

434
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:03,809
They?
- Some American.

435
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:07,151
Can you be more specific?
A name or number?

436
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:10,050
Nothing.
- Why couldn't you always make it so easy, Frank?

437
00:45:10,134 --> 00:45:12,294
It's my nature.

438
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:13,733
Where are you? I'll come there.

439
00:45:13,817 --> 00:45:16,224
That is not a good idea.
They have run a short list.

440
00:45:16,308 --> 00:45:20,272
I can't be much help if you don't
give me something.

441
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:23,778
How close you to a computer?

442
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:30,472
Yes, Frank?
- That was very nice.

443
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:33,319
You're the one that broke the rules, not me.

444
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:35,614
Point well taken.

445
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,447
That makes us even.
So we start with a clean slate.

446
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:42,932
So this call is about kiss and make up thing?

447
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:44,228
More or less.

448
00:45:44,313 --> 00:45:47,012
You have all I need to get the bracelet left.

449
00:45:47,098 --> 00:45:50,141
And the packages you need delivered.

450
00:45:50,928 --> 00:45:53,859
Here are the new coordinates,
two, six, twelve.

451
00:45:53,944 --> 00:45:57,823
That will take you to a new meeting place where we'll
have satisfactory conclusion to this business.

452
00:45:57,907 --> 00:46:00,134
I'll look forward to it.

453
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:06,732
Frank.

454
00:46:06,817 --> 00:46:09,170
Did you get it?

455
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:13,838
Get the signal, Frank.

456
00:46:13,923 --> 00:46:17,983
Give us a little time
and you should have his number and location.

457
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,320
Here you are.

458
00:46:25,322 --> 00:46:27,333
Anything else?

459
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,937
No.

460
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:36,034
Frank, do you know where the signal
is taking you?

461
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,954
I know restaurant there.

462
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:50,688
Fish like you never had.
Roasted with small carrots

463
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:55,460
and black pepper.
Romanian wine not so good.

464
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:59,347
But for the last milk ,
It could be worst.

465
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:04,333
You should really begin to think more positive.

466
00:47:04,757 --> 00:47:07,569
I'm realist.

467
00:47:08,754 --> 00:47:11,715
My friend was right when he said
you were all doom and gloom.

468
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,096
What means
"doom and gloom"?

469
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,447
You know..
You'll only see the horrible and the terrible.

470
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:20,788
Your friend, where does he get this?
He doesn't know me.

471
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:23,933
She told about you in general.
Russians, as in people.

472
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:26,979
I'm not Russian.
I'm Ukrainian.

473
00:47:27,064 --> 00:47:29,171
Excuse me.
- Not excuse.

474
00:47:29,256 --> 00:47:34,413
We're different people.
We're different 'here' and 'here'.

475
00:47:38,691 --> 00:47:43,207
Personally I think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.

476
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:47,630
How can you make such a statement?
You don't know me.

477
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:50,661
I see you putting makeup on.

478
00:47:50,745 --> 00:47:55,358
You were so convinced you're gonna die,
why bother?

479
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:59,588
What does looking good
has to do with dying?

480
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:08,920
Hello.

481
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:12,212
What's that?
- Souvenirs from Ibiza.

482
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:14,569
Do you want one?
- No, thank you.

483
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:17,748
I had a deal.
We need to stay sharp

484
00:48:18,486 --> 00:48:20,579
Ok.

485
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:27,639
You stay sharp, I’ll still
have you say,

486
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,737
Optimist?.

487
00:48:29,821 --> 00:48:31,558
Give me that!

488
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:35,368
Let me go.

489
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:40,047
Give me that!
Let me go!

490
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,522
Jesus!

491
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,943
Great.

492
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:53,384
Just great.
- Come on, Frank Martin, let it knock.

493
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,514
I should be lighting up?
How about those pills?

494
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,036
You'll be lighting up like a
goddamn Christmas tree.

495
00:48:58,121 --> 00:48:59,903
That would be nice.

496
00:48:59,988 --> 00:49:02,820
Boring.

497
00:49:40,668 --> 00:49:42,613
You should stay in the car.

498
00:49:42,697 --> 00:49:46,140
Want me to pee in the car?

499
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:52,425
Okay, go on.

500
00:49:55,997 --> 00:49:59,402
You remember.

501
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:24,586
Don't.

502
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:47,381
Don't.

503
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:49,254
Stop.
- Why? I don't drive.

504
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:51,437
I want to have fun.
I want to be happy.

505
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:54,057
You should try to be happy
instead of so serious.

506
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:57,006
It is important to stay positive
like you say,yeah?

507
00:51:57,091 --> 00:52:01,254
Drink with me, Frankie.
- I don't want to drink.

508
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:08,371
And now who is all gloomy and doomy?
I say try it? Let me do that?

509
00:52:08,455 --> 00:52:11,172
Come on, get in the car.

510
00:52:11,363 --> 00:52:14,806
I'm free like a bird.

511
00:52:21,032 --> 00:52:23,946
The girl!
Come on! faster!

512
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:35,318
I have lost my friend!
- Buy you a new one.

513
00:52:47,466 --> 00:52:50,593
Have you any idea why we
have a car on our ass?

514
00:52:50,678 --> 00:52:53,850
I don't know, I don't care..I..

515
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:58,610
First you say I'm doom and gloom
and now you tell me do not be happy?

516
00:52:58,694 --> 00:53:01,056
Decide once.

517
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:49,483
Yes, Frank?
- I thought we had an agreement?

518
00:53:49,568 --> 00:53:50,695
We do.

519
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:54,299
Tell me more that it had nothing to do with
a car on my ass.

520
00:53:54,384 --> 00:53:55,969
I don't know anything to do with that, Frank.

521
00:53:56,054 --> 00:53:58,655
Is it possible that someone else
has issues with you?

522
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,560
Likely.

523
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,222
I think is that other forces at work here.

524
00:54:06,306 --> 00:54:08,972
Let me check into it
and see what I can find out.

525
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:10,840
And what you suppose I do
in the meantime?

526
00:54:10,925 --> 00:54:13,374
Drive faster.

527
00:54:46,004 --> 00:54:48,754
What the hell is he doing?

528
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,627
Here!

529
00:55:49,712 --> 00:55:52,069
He's down there!

530
00:55:56,196 --> 00:55:57,389
I'm hungry.

531
00:55:57,473 --> 00:56:01,596
You should thought about buying a sandwich
instead a bottle of vodka.

532
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,711
Look!

533
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:11,408
I wasn't hungry then.
I was thirsty.

534
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,815
Why are you so mean to me?

535
00:56:14,114 --> 00:56:18,528
I'm not being mean, I'm being pre-occupied.
- What means pre-occupied?

536
00:56:22,794 --> 00:56:26,000
That means pre-occupied!

537
00:56:35,731 --> 00:56:38,379
Shoot the tires!
Come on! Get it!

538
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:40,788
Get down!

539
00:56:40,873 --> 00:56:43,197
Shoot him!

540
00:56:51,846 --> 00:56:54,041
Watch out!

541
00:57:10,484 --> 00:57:12,658
Stop the car!

542
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:15,290
Holy shit!

543
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:18,985
What are you doing?
- You're so tense.

544
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,627
Like you'll say.

545
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:28,026
I make you relax, okay?

546
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:31,269
Yeah.
- I'm good at this.

547
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:34,240
I get tense go away.

548
00:58:42,097 --> 00:58:43,487
What are you doing?

549
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:51,587
I want to feel sex, one more time,
before I die, won't you?

550
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,634
What is it with you with dying?

551
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,390
Is there something wrong with me?

552
00:58:58,475 --> 00:59:01,026
Do I'm not sexy?

553
00:59:01,259 --> 00:59:03,908
Yes, you're sexy.

554
00:59:08,202 --> 00:59:10,280
You're the gay?

555
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:13,621
Nope, I am not the gay.

556
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:16,062
I don't mine.

557
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:20,483
I'm not, okay?

558
00:59:21,173 --> 00:59:24,511
Then, what’s the problem?

559
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:30,702
Didn't it ever occur to you that maybe
I'm not in the mood?

560
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:48,636
I thought rules is
not to open package?

561
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,337
It is.
- Why you have rules, if you break them?

562
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:58,055
I'm asking myself the same thing.
Phone books!

563
01:00:05,424 --> 01:00:08,779
You're the package.
- Yes.

564
01:00:08,865 --> 01:00:10,579
You could've said something.

565
01:00:10,664 --> 01:00:14,349
Would that make a difference?
- Yes.

566
01:00:15,053 --> 01:00:16,641
Now what you're doing?

567
01:00:16,725 --> 01:00:21,553
You know, back in garage,
saw your sweaty body is good.

568
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:24,239
Take off your clothes.

569
01:00:24,323 --> 01:00:26,499
I was trying to keep five cretins from
craving my heads in.

570
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:28,563
I don't see what time on is, in it..

571
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:33,541
I think it's only man, it’s soon or noon, my striptease..

572
01:00:33,624 --> 01:00:38,782
I don't like where this is going, Valentina.
- Just striptease for me again.

573
01:00:38,866 --> 01:00:40,519
Give me the keys.

574
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:44,461
This is not funny.
- Do you want the keys?

575
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:49,459
I want you to stop playing around,
that's what I want.

576
01:00:49,543 --> 01:00:52,997
Maybe this is the last chance to play around,
for you and for me.

577
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,455
This is not the time, the place,
for playing.

578
01:00:55,539 --> 01:00:59,615
Why do I get feeling with you it's
never the time or place.

579
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:04,758
If I wanna get out of the lies,
I would see a psychiatrist. Now,give me the keys.

580
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:07,180
Come on, Frank Martin.

581
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:10,408
Make play time for me.

582
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,369
All right?

583
01:01:30,455 --> 01:01:34,105
Fair enough?
- Not enough. That is not a striptease, Frank.

584
01:01:34,189 --> 01:01:37,642
Striptease is sexy, you know.
Move your ass a little.

585
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:39,804
Come on, Frank Martin.

586
01:01:39,888 --> 01:01:41,981
You want keys?.

587
01:01:42,148 --> 01:01:45,196
I want striptease.

588
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:53,396
You know what I'm going to do to you
for making me do this?

589
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:55,328
Spank me.

590
01:01:55,414 --> 01:01:58,145
Starters
- Tie me up?

591
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:04,247
You like that, wouldn’t you?
- I like the rough stock.

592
01:02:06,386 --> 01:02:08,447
Really?

593
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,200
But not too rough.

594
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,387
There was the striptease with the keys.

595
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:22,275
You did.
Kiss me for the keys.

596
01:02:29,248 --> 01:02:31,901
You can't mean it.

597
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:39,953
Do you ever kissed and look at me, Frank?

598
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:43,052
I think you maybe not.

599
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:46,164
I'm thinking, you live alone.

600
01:02:46,249 --> 01:02:48,750
Inside and outside.

601
01:02:48,835 --> 01:02:53,926
There's no time you were afraid of,
to live in.

602
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:57,301
Live with me.
Just this once.

603
01:02:57,385 --> 01:03:00,852
Just this one minute.
Live with me.

604
01:03:41,341 --> 01:03:44,727
What's his position?
- We lost him.

605
01:03:44,976 --> 01:03:46,562
He headed into the mountains.

606
01:03:46,647 --> 01:03:49,216
I can't get reception on there
and they could moving out of place.

607
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,444
Hack into one of the military satellites.

608
01:03:58,275 --> 01:03:59,532
Yes?

609
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:02,087
Do you think we're playing games here,
Mr. Minister?

610
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:03,857
I do not know what you're talking about.

611
01:04:03,942 --> 01:04:07,394
I talking about a black car,
full with your incompetent operatives.

612
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,342
One more foolish like that anymore,
and you'll never see your daughter again.

613
01:04:10,427 --> 01:04:11,849
I want to hear her voice.

614
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:14,304
When the contract is signed
and delivered.

615
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:17,056
I would not sign until
I hear her voice.

616
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,776
You're in no position to play hard bomb,
Mr Minister.

617
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,345
Well neither are you,
Mr Johnson.

618
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,476
Listen, I know who you are.

619
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,521
And I can assure you,
if anything happens to my daughter,

620
01:04:28,605 --> 01:04:31,606
I will use all the power I have
and I will hunt you down

621
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:36,560
and I'll make you pay
in the most heist way for this.

622
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,096
We have to move now.

623
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:48,652
Pick up, Frank.
Pick up.

624
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,352
I'm in Ibiza, making holiday.

625
01:05:11,677 --> 01:05:16,105
Someone has me a glass of champagne.
I drink.

626
01:05:16,493 --> 01:05:19,662
Then I don't feel so good.

627
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:35,306
I go to bathroom
and next thing I'm awake in the car.

628
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,239
I asked him what is this.

629
01:05:37,324 --> 01:05:40,858
He tells me he was just a transporter.

630
01:05:42,826 --> 01:05:45,604
He's pretty good driver.

631
01:05:45,873 --> 01:05:48,621
Not like you good.

632
01:05:48,918 --> 01:05:50,442
I told him,

633
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:56,629
Please, my father were really powerful man,
with influence.

634
01:05:56,713 --> 01:05:59,382
There was a lot of people.
Let me call him.

635
01:05:59,467 --> 01:06:02,329
He's afraid.
He's never done this before.

636
01:06:02,414 --> 01:06:04,097
It suppose to be simple.

637
01:06:04,182 --> 01:06:06,882
Pick up, drop off.
Easy money.

638
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:10,681
He's been told no calls,
never leave cars.

639
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,609
But I convinced him.

640
01:06:14,206 --> 01:06:16,478
I called.

641
01:06:16,564 --> 01:06:18,836
But before I said to my father
where we were.

642
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:21,772
Boarding!
Come on!

643
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:29,053
We gonna wait, but ...

644
01:06:31,056 --> 01:06:36,032
These people shooting at us.
Why? Why they shooting at us?

645
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:41,045
He says they shoot
because we didn't adhere the plan.

646
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,819
He said :
"Okay, That's the old plan"

647
01:06:43,905 --> 01:06:45,402
"What's the new plan? "

648
01:06:45,486 --> 01:06:48,629
He says he has a friend.

649
01:06:56,294 --> 01:06:58,646
And then I met you.

650
01:07:01,306 --> 01:07:03,757
And then I felt it's going to be OK.

651
01:07:08,216 --> 01:07:10,740
But you don't know me.

652
01:07:11,066 --> 01:07:16,770
Of course I don't know you.
Talk about feelings. Not knowing

653
01:07:18,108 --> 01:07:22,135
Well, if you has feeling that way,
you should've know a way of showing it.

654
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:27,440
Better for a woman
to have a little misfortune for her, you know?

655
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,388
No.

656
01:07:31,472 --> 01:07:32,861
Yes.

657
01:07:32,946 --> 01:07:35,431
Just a little.

658
01:07:59,902 --> 01:08:02,747
They're back on the radar, sir.

659
01:08:07,077 --> 01:08:08,890
Yes?
- Where the hell are you?

660
01:08:08,977 --> 01:08:12,762
On the way to Bucharest.
- Not any longer.

661
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:17,976
New coordinates,
three, seven, thirteen.

662
01:08:53,555 --> 01:08:55,817
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

663
01:08:56,109 --> 01:08:58,089
Say, just a minute.

664
01:08:58,173 --> 01:09:01,150
Inspector Tarconi, from Marseille.

665
01:09:01,613 --> 01:09:04,902
Well, not exactly in Marseille
but a small town.

666
01:09:04,986 --> 01:09:07,456
What do you like inspector?
- A word with you.

667
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:09,518
I've no time.

668
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:12,424
It's about your daughter.

669
01:09:19,103 --> 01:09:22,438
Odessa, Frank, my country.

670
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:26,917
You take me home.
Thank you.

671
01:09:27,948 --> 01:09:31,093
What happened to Bucharest?

672
01:09:31,321 --> 01:09:33,102
They changed the plan.

673
01:09:33,188 --> 01:09:36,543
It's a good change.
I prefer Odessa.

674
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:38,858
Yeah.

675
01:09:38,987 --> 01:09:42,275
I was looking for to that fish with
the carrots to myself.

676
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,845
It's much better here.
Do you know

677
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,482
I do.

678
01:09:47,566 --> 01:09:51,215
I know restaurant here.
Best in the world.

679
01:09:51,299 --> 01:09:55,605
The chicken so fresh
and the butter when it's coming out.

680
01:09:55,689 --> 01:09:59,517
Like you cannot believe that it's
so nice.

681
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:06,233
You know what I feel now right know?

682
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:10,559
Hungry.

683
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:15,435
Safe.

684
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:27,467
It's going to end up like more like this is.
Happily ever after?.

685
01:10:29,818 --> 01:10:32,848
Well tonight this is all gonna be
a faded memory.

686
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:36,959
It's gonna be you and me laughing over
a chienkiev.

687
01:10:38,827 --> 01:10:41,579
Liar.

688
01:10:57,529 --> 01:11:00,507
Mr. Minister,
an update, please.

689
01:11:01,066 --> 01:11:03,767
I'm ready to sign the contract.

690
01:11:03,851 --> 01:11:06,597
I want to speak to my daughter.

691
01:11:07,061 --> 01:11:09,959
Hello?

692
01:11:10,043 --> 01:11:13,576
Keep that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

693
01:11:21,703 --> 01:11:23,846
We are closing the news, Frank.

694
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:27,219
Yeah, well let it close, just make sure no one tries to drag
me out of the car with it.

695
01:11:27,303 --> 01:11:29,676
You know what this is about yet?

696
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,642
The girl, her father,
large amount of toxic waste.

697
01:11:34,804 --> 01:11:38,911
It's a trade,
a signature of life.

698
01:11:38,996 --> 01:11:42,155
I have a reputation
to repoll them, inspector.

699
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,267
100% successful deliveries, right?

700
01:11:45,351 --> 01:11:49,362
Hear what I have doubts about you?

701
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:54,077
That's not the Frank I know,
with its rules, no names.

702
01:11:54,162 --> 01:11:57,223
Why is everyone so concern
about my rules?

703
01:11:57,308 --> 01:12:03,928
Well Frank, I've always suspected,
you're romantic, a heart

704
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:06,690
Anything else?

705
01:12:06,773 --> 01:12:10,862
For now, no.
- I'll call you back.

706
01:12:15,093 --> 01:12:17,662
Yeah?
- We're almost to do end, Frank.

707
01:12:17,746 --> 01:12:20,741
Just give me the coordinates.
- No more coordinates.

708
01:12:20,825 --> 01:12:25,325
The road you're on,
make your first left.

709
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:28,453
I like to know where I'm going.

710
01:12:31,108 --> 01:12:34,084
You'll know when you get there.

711
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:05,826
Don't worry
I've got them, right where we want them.

712
01:13:11,135 --> 01:13:13,146
My compliments, Frank.

713
01:13:13,232 --> 01:13:16,633
Our trust in your abilities
is well-deserved.

714
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,320
Now if you could please send
the girl out.

715
01:13:20,405 --> 01:13:22,351
She's coming.

716
01:13:22,436 --> 01:13:24,823
I'm not coming.

717
01:13:25,122 --> 01:13:27,165
They need you.
They won't kill you.

718
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:29,935
But they will kill you.

719
01:13:30,395 --> 01:13:35,176
Do I look like a man who came off from Europe
to die on a bridge?

720
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:47,625
We don't have all day, Frank.

721
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:54,809
Look how many of them.
They have all the guns.

722
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:57,645
How's that gonna be OK?

723
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:02,883
Tell at you over dinner.

724
01:14:03,084 --> 01:14:05,029
Go now.

725
01:14:05,113 --> 01:14:06,405
Go.

726
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:09,435
Kiss me.

727
01:14:30,565 --> 01:14:33,807
You're gonna get me kill,
now go!

728
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:59,490
Go to hell,
you bastard.

729
01:15:22,611 --> 01:15:25,524
Better now,
darling?

730
01:15:42,361 --> 01:15:44,852
Finish him.

731
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:04,667
Frank, no!

732
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:18,275
His beloved car will be his grave.

733
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:20,320
He leaves, he blows,
He stays, he's drowns.

734
01:16:20,404 --> 01:16:22,963
Let's get out of here.

735
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:34,637
Tarconi.
- They have the girl.

736
01:16:34,867 --> 01:16:39,510
Frank? We are trying to track him.
Where are you?

737
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:43,724
In a lake!
- Lake?

738
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:47,641
Can you be more specific?.
- It's a dam.

739
01:16:48,557 --> 01:16:50,504
A dam?
- I know the place, sir.

740
01:16:50,589 --> 01:16:52,470
How far?
- 10 minutes, at least.

741
01:16:52,555 --> 01:16:54,631
Frank, we'll be there in ten minutes.

742
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:57,384
Make it a bit faster.
- We'll do our best.

743
01:16:57,469 --> 01:16:59,760
Thank you.

744
01:18:52,074 --> 01:18:55,658
Buy tickets for all of us.
- Where to?

745
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:59,557
Anywhere this train is going,
we need to keep moving for half an hour.

746
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,484
Why don't we, you see..
driving around?

747
01:19:06,847 --> 01:19:09,961
Another day.

748
01:19:22,177 --> 01:19:24,404
Sir!

749
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:47,071
Get out!

750
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:07,717
Mr. Minister?
- Yes.

751
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:10,817
Someone wants to talk to you.

752
01:20:10,914 --> 01:20:13,719
Papa!
- Are you alright?

753
01:20:17,597 --> 01:20:19,870
Don't sign.

754
01:20:19,955 --> 01:20:23,914
What you have is 15 minutes.

755
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,760
Have you found out
what this is all about?

756
01:20:31,845 --> 01:20:35,067
Garbage
- How much garbage are we talking about?

757
01:20:35,152 --> 01:20:38,700
Enough to pollute half the country
for 100 years.

758
01:20:38,784 --> 01:20:41,735
Try it again.

759
01:20:59,031 --> 01:21:03,041
For a modern woman
you're very unformed.

760
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,726
This is the 'new world'.

761
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:08,444
There are no more countries,
That's old think.

762
01:21:08,528 --> 01:21:11,787
There's economic reality.
Profit and loss.

763
01:21:11,871 --> 01:21:14,440
Efficiency and waste.

764
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:17,485
Think global, not local.

765
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:20,125
Think this.

766
01:21:33,357 --> 01:21:36,576
Yes?
- Where are we?

767
01:21:42,561 --> 01:21:45,598
We're almost there.

768
01:21:48,064 --> 01:21:50,665
Well?
Here, he's on train.

769
01:21:50,749 --> 01:21:52,794
And where are we?
- Here.

770
01:21:52,878 --> 01:21:55,854
You can get units there.

771
01:21:56,613 --> 01:21:59,589
That's a good idea, do that.

772
01:22:02,246 --> 01:22:05,648
Oh Frank, come on!.

773
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:38,224
Mr. Minister, I assure you
everything is in order.

774
01:22:38,309 --> 01:22:40,418
I'm sure it is.

775
01:22:40,503 --> 01:22:44,033
If there are any problems ...
- I know, you will solve them.

776
01:22:45,088 --> 01:22:47,871
If you don't mind.

777
01:23:15,846 --> 01:23:20,608
You may not believe this,
but I’m at heart a pacifist.

778
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:23,602
I hate violence.

779
01:23:24,393 --> 01:23:27,538
It creates more problems,
than it solves.

780
01:23:29,012 --> 01:23:32,254
You know,
I never want to do any of this.

781
01:23:33,073 --> 01:23:35,915
A client asked me to obtain
the results, so ...

782
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:40,556
I'm about creating an environment with that result could be
obtain with the least amount of blood being shed.

783
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,995
But nobody wanted to cooperate, not you,
not the first driver, not your father ...

784
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,223
nor the recently deceased, Frank Martin.

785
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:50,952
Everybody wanted to fight.

786
01:24:05,402 --> 01:24:07,414
What's so funny?

787
01:24:07,498 --> 01:24:10,515
You're hearing that man talking.

788
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,349
One more step, Frank.

789
01:26:19,433 --> 01:26:22,249
Come on.
One.

790
01:27:02,668 --> 01:27:06,154
Look.
It's over.

791
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,346
Two minutes to nine.
He signed.

792
01:27:11,644 --> 01:27:14,094
Oh, my God.

793
01:27:18,718 --> 01:27:21,438
No, Frank. No.

794
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,723
It's over, Frank.

795
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,950
It's over.

796
01:28:03,035 --> 01:28:06,913
Mission accomplished.
You and the girls free to go.

797
01:28:06,998 --> 01:28:11,108
As a matter fact, I'm so impressed by your talent
I like to offer you a position.

798
01:28:11,192 --> 01:28:15,564
I like to offer you one.
Permanently disable.

799
01:28:32,612 --> 01:28:36,753
I hate to waste time Frank, but at this point
I really don't think we make a good fit.

800
01:28:36,837 --> 01:28:39,224
You're right.

801
01:29:05,628 --> 01:29:10,608
You make a good fit.
You and the bracelet were made for each other.

802
01:29:43,988 --> 01:29:47,333
You're doing the right thing.

803
01:30:04,422 --> 01:30:06,978
Valentina!.

804
01:30:11,104 --> 01:30:13,554
Valentina!.

805
01:30:22,109 --> 01:30:24,791
Am I in heaven?

806
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,722
It's more like in hell.

807
01:30:29,806 --> 01:30:35,116
I don 't care,
as long as we're there together.

808
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:50,751
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

809
01:30:50,836 --> 01:30:53,384
Thank you.

810
01:31:06,493 --> 01:31:09,027
What are you doing?
- What you said, the right thing.

811
01:31:09,112 --> 01:31:11,191
And now gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me.

812
01:31:11,274 --> 01:31:15,253
I have a conference to address on the dangerous
of doing business with people like you.

813
01:31:15,338 --> 01:31:18,481
Thank you very much.

814
01:31:34,431 --> 01:31:35,788
Is the boat ready?

815
01:31:35,872 --> 01:31:38,836
It's on the water sir, waiting for us!
- Time to leave!.

816
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,607
Ride along!.
- Okay.

817
01:31:58,472 --> 01:32:01,533
I just don't understand it.

818
01:32:01,617 --> 01:32:06,840
When I was a kid, my father and I used to pull fish
out of this very spot all day long.

819
01:32:06,924 --> 01:32:12,356
Times change inspector.
- As the people.

820
01:32:13,605 --> 01:32:16,294
You refer to me?

821
01:32:16,882 --> 01:32:19,712
I don't think that's a very
accurate statement.

822
01:32:19,797 --> 01:32:22,790
Ride the same car,
live in the same house.

823
01:32:22,874 --> 01:32:26,733
I was not referring to
your car or your house.

824
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:33,502
It's seems restful.
Is lunch ready yet?

825
01:32:33,586 --> 01:32:36,973
Miss, there is a certain
progression to seem.

826
01:32:37,057 --> 01:32:40,675
In order to eat a lunch,
you must first have to catch the lunch.

827
01:32:40,759 --> 01:32:44,343
And if we keep talking instead of
concentrating, we're gonna catch nothing.

828
01:32:44,428 --> 01:32:45,587
I have better idea.

829
01:32:45,672 --> 01:32:49,746
Why wouldn't skip catching the lunch?
And go right to eating the lunch?

830
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:53,252
I know wonderful place,
just up coast from here.

831
01:32:53,336 --> 01:32:56,298
Where they make fish soup incredible.

832
01:32:56,382 --> 01:33:01,331
They use tomatoes and onions
and little amount of white lavender.

833
01:33:02,508 --> 01:33:04,485
What kind of wine?

834
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:07,490
Pink, from south.

835
01:33:07,618 --> 01:33:10,778
It should be enough, perhaps.
- Chilled?

836
01:33:10,861 --> 01:33:14,709
Of course chilled.
- And for dessert?

837
01:33:17,271 --> 01:33:30,812
