They only mate with their own kind.

It's yuppie inbreeding.

That's why they're retarded
and wear the same clothes.

57
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,372
They don't feel love.
They only negotiate love moments.

They're evil, Edwin.

00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,319
Are you gonna do
a little work today or what?

161
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,072
Hm? What, out there?

162
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,200
They're not terrorists,
Jack.

163
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,995
They're just ordinary people,
like you and me.

164
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,585
Breakfast of champions,
right?

165
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,214
That one.

166
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,550
It'll be funny, and then
the scary one will do.

167
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,887
That one. A scary one
and a funny one.

168
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,514
Oh. Oh!

169
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,186
- Excuse me.
- Can you help me?

170
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,854
I've looked for an hour,

171
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,481
and I'm losing my mind.

172
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,401
What I'm in the mood for
is a Katharine Hepburn-y,

173
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,236
Cary Grant-y kind of thing.

174
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,196
Nothing heavy.
I couldn't take heavy.

175
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,283
Something zany.
I'm looking for something zany.

176
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:22,204
Or something modern, like a Goldie
Hawn-y, Chevy Chase-y thing.

177
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,916
You know, funny. I wanna laugh.
I have to laugh tonight, really.

178
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:30,045
Oh, do you have anything with
that comedian? He's on that show.

179
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:34,967
It's On the Radio. You know the guy.
He says, "Hey, forgive me!"

180
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,386
I get such a kick
out of the way he says that.

181
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,971
He's so goddamn adorable.

182
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,141
That would be perfect.
Didn't he make a movie?

183
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,644
Ordinary Peepholes.

184
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,484
It's kind of a big-titty,
spread-cheeky kind of thing.

185
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,822
Excuse me, I just want to
borrow him for a minute.

186
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,787
You're gonna love that.

187
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,836
Frightening woman.
Are you in a mood today?

188
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,130
If she didn't get something zany,

189
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,468
she would've killed us all.
Are you in an "emotional abyss"?

190
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,430
Will you explain this to me?
I don't understand these moods.

191
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,517
Anne, they're my moods.
You wanna understand? Have your own.

192
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,188
I hate desperate people.
Sweetie, baby, love of my life,

193
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,732
you hate people.

194
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,945
Look, why don't you take the day off,
go upstairs, put your feet up?

195
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,407
I'll cook tonight, okay?

196
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,077
Right.

197
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,163
You seen my orange cup
with the teddy bear?

198
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,123
Grandma used it
for her urine specimen.

199
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,585
I'll kill her!

200
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:56,340
Here I am, I'm dying.
The doctors are dividing up my estate!

201
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,178
I gotta hide my trophy cups in case
Grandma finds herself in a beer hall.

202
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,764
It's funny. What do you want?

203
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,516
It's not funny.

204
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,184
Then why do we watch it?

205
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,687
It makes me feel good
to see how not funny it is.

206
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,983
America doesn't know funny.
It makes it easier not being a funny TV celebrity.

207
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,986
Because that would just mean
I'm not really talented.

208
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,157
You are a sick fuck,
you know that?

209
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,494
I don't know why you...

210
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,829
Shh, shh!

211
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,498
Don't you do that.
I'm trying to watch!

212
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,418
You have too many thoughts
rolling around up there.

213
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,255
You're very self-absorbed, Jack.
God, divert yourself.

214
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,798
My God, read a book.

215
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,508
It's important to think.

216
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,513
It separates us from lentils and
people that read books like Love Song.

217
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,725
Great book, dumb title.

218
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,106
You know, you used to say
that you liked that about me.

219
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,068
You said you liked that we
didn't have to think all the time.

220
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,322
That we could just be together
and not think.

221
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:08,662
Well, suicidal paranoiacs
will say anything to get laid.

222
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,634
Have another drink, Jack.
It's on the house, like everything else.

223
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,473
I hope your children treat you
with the same disrespect.

224
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,558
I got a fever. I'm dying.

225
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,810
- You're not dying.
- You have a cold.

226
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,729
Besides, you can't die
before Sunday,

227
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,856
because we have to go
to the Billy Joel concert.

228
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:41,236
Ah. Well, forgive me!

229
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,781
Madness.

230
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,627
Shit!

231
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,883
Fuck!

232
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,096
Forgive me!

233
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,810
Fuck.

234
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,651
Hey, watch it, asshole!

235
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,112
Well, forgive me, fuckhead!

236
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,917
Hey! Hey, over here!

237
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,544
Here I am!

238
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,547
Oh, taxi!

239
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,508
Hello! Merry Christmas!

240
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,139
Hey, buddy.
Buddy, help a guy out.

241
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,142
Help me out with a quarter.
Come on, sport!

242
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,311
Sport.
Hey, I told you!

243
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,146
What's the matter with you?

244
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,983
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

245
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,234
You're a maniac!

246
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,654
- You're crazy!
- Mr. Bum.

247
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,325
Here.

248
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,385
Hey, anybody here named Jiminy?

249
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,393
You ever read any Nietzsche?

250
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,689
Nietzsche says there are two kinds
of people in the world.

251
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,067
People who are destined
for greatness,

252
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,737
like Walt Disney

253
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,238
and Hitler.

254
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,949
And then there's the rest of us.

255
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,704
He called us
"the bungled and the botched."

256
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,206
We get teased.

257
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,960
We sometimes
get close to greatness,

258
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,463
but we never get there.

259
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,176
We're the expendable masses.

260
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,391
We get pushed in front of trains,
take poison aspirin,

261
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,103
get gunned down in Dairy Queens.

262
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,735
You wanna hear the new title
of my biography,

263
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,071
my little Italian friend?

264
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:36,620
The Jack Lucas Story.

265
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,705
You like it?

266
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,919
Il no-va esta fucking picnic-o.

267
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,256
You're a good kid.

268
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,801
You say no to drugs.

269
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,400
You ever get the feeling sometimes,

270
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,778
you're being punished
for your sins?

271
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,561
Woo-hoo!

272
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,618
Hey, what's going on?

273
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,833
I said,
what's going on?

274
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,213
What are you
doing here, man?

275
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,550
You shouldn't
hang around here!

276
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,844
I was just leaving.

277
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,055
People spend a lot of money
for this neighborhood.

278
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,390
It's not fair.

279
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,560
Looking out their windows to see
your ass asleep on the streets!

280
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,853
Yes, I agree.

281
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,147
Good. That's very good.

282
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,107
Do you believe this drunk?

283
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,235
Me neither, man! Do it!

284
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,659
Hold, varlet!

285
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,662
Or feel the sting of my shaft!

286
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,542
In the name of Blanche de Fleur,

287
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,545
unhand that errant knight!

288
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,131
Do you speak English?

289
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,800
Let the bum go, dipshit!

290
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:01,306
Mendacity! Why are two
attractive city squires like you

291
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,141
abusing a knight like this?

292
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,684
Are you
a faggot too?

293
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,271
Faggot? No, but I do
believe in fairies.

294
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,899
Not without dinner.
Are you fucking nuts?

295
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,277
Viola! Let's show him
what he's won!

296
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,112
I advise you to let us go.

297
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,656
You advise us, huh?

298
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,492
Yes. You're outnumbered, son.
Ha-ha-ha.

299
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,786
Can't you see?

300
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,295
Looks like Night of the Living Dead.

301
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,130
Come on, go for it!

302
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,425
- They can't do nothing!
- Can't do nothing.

303
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,094
Can't do nothing!

304
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,929
Nothing?!

305
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,473
Gentlemen!

306
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,145
♪ I like New York in June ♪

307
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,690
♪ How about you? ♪

308
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,527

309
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,446
♪ How about you? ♪♪

310
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,532
Oh, look. It's showtime.

311
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,117
You know, boys,

312
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,953
there's three things
in this world that you need:

313
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,955
Respect for all kinds of life,

314
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,541
a nice bowel movement
on a regular basis

315
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,627
and a navy blazer.
Oh, and one more thing:

316
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,131
Never take your eye off the ball!

317
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,469
The ability to be a shithead
can be a fabulous advantage.

318
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,645
Hey, hey, hey!

319
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,774
Please. Don't hurt me!

320
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,987
Why? So you can be healthy
when you jump? No.

321
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,157
You can't leave me tied up
out here alone, you faggot!

322
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,285
You're not gonna be alone.

323
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,995
Huh?

324
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,498
Come and get it!

325
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,834
I need a drink.

326
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,379
Hey, I know a fabulous place
with great ambiance.

327
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,018
What do you think
of the death penalty?

328
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,772
Death's definitely a penalty.
Ain't no fucking gift.

329
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,649
Life's too goddamn short.

330
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,150
Great place, huh?

331
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,202
How are you tonight?
Not bad, John. You?

332
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,370
Can't complain.

333
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,163
Can I interest anybody in a fruit pie?

334
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,750
No, thank you. Too fattening.
Crazy fucking...

335
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,735
Have a drink!
I better be leaving.

336
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,405
Drink, goddamn it!
No.

337
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,495
I think they like you.

Hi.

345
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,516
Welcome back.

346
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,686
How you feeling?

347
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,771
Have I died?
Oh, no.

348
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,734
Hey, easy, easy.
Want to get up?

349
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,904
There you go. Gravity works.
Take it real slow. There you go.

350
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,990
Take a few breaths, huh?

351
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,285
Where am I?
My domicile.

352
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,620
It's my humble abode.

353
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,627
Want something to eat?
Your stomach must be a real tabula rasa.

354
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:03,131
I don't know if these are raisins or rat shit.
You can't tell.

355
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,633
Oh. Oh, heh.

356
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,926
How about a fruit pie?

357
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,473
I was off by a couple of months.

358
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,603
It's nice to have company.
Hi.

359
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,313
Where are my shoes?

360
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,606
What?
Where?

361
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,316
What? Shh. Shh.
What?

362
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,318
Excuse me.

363
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,237
What is it?
We've got company.

364
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,906
What?

365
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,201
I knew it.
I knew it last night.

366
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,036
I did too. I did. Don't...

367
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,662
Don't...

368
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,082
He's the one!

369
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,000
Can you keep a secret?

370
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,668
No.
Good.

371
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,089
Know what the little people told me?
The little people?

372
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,257
Oh. You know.

373
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,761
They said you're the one.

374
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,889
The one what?

375
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,809
Shut up!

376
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,519
Get away from him!

377
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:58,895
This'll get rid...

378
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,481
Wintergreen.
So sorry about this.

379
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,775
Oh, there we are.

380
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,362
They said you're not ready
to know yet.

381
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,988
I'm not?

382
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,907
He is too!

383
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,575
Get out of here. Fuck off!

384
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,868
Beat it!

385
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,121
I have rights! Oh, yeah.

386
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,706
Fly up there. Oh, yeah.

387
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,418
Come on! Out of here! Yah!

388
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,632
Hey! You can't be in there.

389
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,094
You're frightening him!

390
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,179
Do you know who I am?

391
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,349
I'm drawing a blank.
Take a guess.

392
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,601
Let him guess.

393
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,436
Uh...

394
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,858
You seem to be
some kind of vigilante.

395
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,402
That happens along the way,
of course.

396
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,028
Here's a clue.

397
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,035
A hood ornament?
No.

398
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,704
I'm a knight.

399
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,664
On a special quest.

400
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,292
And I need help.

401
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,172
Quest?

402
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,717
That's why they sent you.

403
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,428
The little...
Yes, yes.

404
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,599
You see,
they work for him.

405
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,267
So do I.

406
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,394
Him?

407
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,229
God.

408
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,690
I'm the janitor of God.

409
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,276
I know.

410
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,864
I know how you feel.

411
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,533
They came to me
about a year ago.

412
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,954
I was sitting on the john, having a
really satisfying bowel movement.

413
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,458
Those ones that border
on mystical, where you're like:

414
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,679
Oh!

415
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,098
And there they were.

416
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:04,103
Hundreds of
the cutest little fat people

417
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,814
floating right in front of me.

418
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,235
It was wonderful. And then,

419
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,028
they spoke.

420
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,365
And they said
that I had been chosen

421
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,701
to get back something
very special that he had lost.

422
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,454
My part will be very dangerous.
I said, "Whoa!"

423
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,915
"Hold it right there." I mean...

424
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:28,962
If you see floating little fat people
say you're on a mission from God,

425
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:33,883
they'll slap you some heavy Thorazine.
I said, "Give me a sign."

426
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:39,138
And they said, "Look in Progressive
Architecture, February '88, page 33."

427
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,892
That's pretty specific, huh?

428
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,770
Bingo! He knows.

429
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,232
He knows. He does.
It's right here.

430
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,235
Where is it?
A, B, F, M. M!

431
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,904
Under Miscellaneous,
not Mythology.

432
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,699
Look at this. Here it is.

433
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,580
See it?

434
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,083
- Langdon Carmichael.
- No, no.

435
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,044
Right there. See it?

436
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,088
What?

437
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,425
The Grail.

438
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,013
The Holy Grail.

439
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,600
It's God's symbol
of divine grace.

440
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,644
The Holy...
Yes.

441
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:31,274
Some billionaire has got the Holy
Grail in his library on Fifth Avenue?

442
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,235
I know. Who'd think you'd
find anything divine there?

443
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,573
I don't mean to be flippant or enrage
you, but you're a psychotic man.

444
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,826
I know.
A very nice psychotic man.

445
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,620
I appreciate what you did.

446
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:48,624
It was a brave and noble thing.
You're embarrassing me.

447
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:52,754
I'll see a lot of you on various
talk shows when you get the Grail.

448
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,005
Please don't go!

449
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,716
I can't.

450
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,427
I can't get it.

451
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,805
Because he's out there.

452
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,558
He's always out there.

453
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,105
That's why you can get it.
That's why you're the one.

454
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,275
I'm not the one.

455
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,944
I'm not anyone.

456
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,658
Forget about the shoes.

457
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,911
I'm gonna take a cab.

458
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,372
Parry.
Parry, I'm Jack.

459
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,831
I know.

460
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:37,590
Oh! Oh, wait! Listen, don't...

461
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,425
They're... Here they are.

462
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,346
Jack. Jack.

463
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,306
Here you go.
As they were.

464
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,477
Uh, you can keep the doll.

465
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,607
Hey, thanks a mil, huh?

466
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,777
Now that you know where we are,
don't be a stranger.

467
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,904
Come back. We'll rummage.

468
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,534
Take care of yourself, Jack.
Give my love to the wife.

469
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:09,080
I'm not married.
Really? You look married.

470
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,876
Don't be a stranger.

471
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,422
See you.

472
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,019
Hey. Hey, where you
coming from?

473
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,356
The basement, I think.

474
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,860
I tell him no visitors!

475
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,487
Hey, hold it! Hold it.
Huh?

476
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,699
Listen. You a friend of Parry's?
No.

477
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,617
I don't allow no entertaining.

478
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,204
I let him stay out of the goodness
of my heart because of the tragedy.

479
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,873
But I'm not running a hotel.

480
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,542
And nobody's taking
advantage of me.

481
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:55,918
Tragedy?

482
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,379
He and his wife were in some bar

483
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,592
and some nut comes in with
a shotgun and blew the place apart.

484
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,595
Splattered her brains
all over the walls.

485
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,389
She was a beautiful girl.

486
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,391
Never knew what hit her.

487
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,770
You ought to have heard about
that nut who listened to the radio.

488
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,316
You could've been attacked,
raped, God knows!

489
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,526
I was up all night long, Jack.

490
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,819
Sorry.

491
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,280
- Yeah?
- A guy wants

492
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,074
to check out the pornos.
So send him back.

493
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,160
What the hell happened?

494
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,828
I was attacked.

495
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,288
What?

496
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,790
Oh, baby!

497
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,419
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Oh, my God.

498
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,047
Ow.
What did they do to you?

499
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,882
You almost done?

500
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,260
Are you looking for a story?
I've seen most of them.

501
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,805
Here. Creamer Versus Creamer.
Won an award. Go.

502
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,313
Did you call the police?
Do you want me to call up the doctor?

503
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,650
Are you sure?

504
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,072
So where did you
sleep last night?

505
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,617
I stayed at a friend's,
Anne.

506
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:15,039
Okay, Jack. I want you to be
up front with me now.

507
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,792
If you're seeing
somebody else, tell me.

508
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,211
Don't pour gasoline
all over yourself

509
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,005
and light a match
just to break up with me.

510
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:24,465
Just tell me the truth.

511
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,593
Anne, I was not
seeing anyone else.

512
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,054
I really was attacked.

513
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,975
Okay.

514
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,567
I've got a cut here.
Okay, I see it now. I'm sorry.

515
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,528
I love you.
What are you gonna do?

516
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,990
You don't have to say it back.

517
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,951
Although it wouldn't
break your jaw to try.

518
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,373
You know what the Holy Grail is?

519
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,916
Holy Grail?

520
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,212
Yeah, I know that one.
That was like Jesus' juice glass.

521
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,800
Oh. Yeah, I used to be
such a Catholic.

522
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,387
Do you still believe in God?
You gotta believe in God.

523
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:15,558
But I don't believe that God
made men in his image.

524
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,269
Most of the shit that happens
is because of men.

525
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,772
No, I think man was made
in the devil's image

526
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,983
and women were
created out of God.

527
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,653
After all, women have babies,
which is kind of like creating.

528
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,449
And it accounts for the fact
that women are so attracted to men.

529
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,453
Let's face it, the devil is
a hell of a lot more interesting.

530
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:39,123
I've slept with some saints in my day,
and I know what I'm talking about.

531
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,583
Boring.

532
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,795
So the whole point of life,

533
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,840
I think, is for
men and women

534
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:52,011
to get married, so that God
and the devil can get together

535
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,096
and work it out.

536
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,601
Not that we have to
get married or anything.

537
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,603
God forbid.

538
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,689
You have a little thing
right here.

539
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,191
What, a pimple?

540
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:09,070
This stuff is supposed to blend
with my skin. Like it works.

541
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:16,619
No, I don't think I'm up for it
tonight, honey.

542
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,207
I just had a very
traumatic experience.

543
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,627
I'm getting sick.

544
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,255
Ow, ow, ow. Ow.
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Ow.

545
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,633
Careful, careful, careful now.

546
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,136
Anne, I spent the night
in a boiler room.

547
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,971
I'm tired.

548
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,598
I'm upset. I don't...

549
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,395
I'm not in the mood, okay?
Okay.

550
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,669
Parry?

551
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,297
Parry?

552
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,075
Oh! Gee.
Can I help you?

553
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,620
I was looking for Parry.

554
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,663
He's not here.

555
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,168
The hospital said it'd be best if we
kept certain things away from him.

556
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,505
There, that's his real name.
Henry Sagan.

557
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,799
He was a teacher
at Hunter College.

558
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:39,178
They kept him in a mental place
over on Staten Island.

559
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:43,432
He did not speak for a year, and then
all of a sudden he started talking.

560
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,935
Only now, he's this "Parry" guy.

561
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,022
He and his wife
used to live upstairs.

562
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,982
When he got released,

563
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,109
they sent him here.

564
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,196
I felt bad.

565
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,323
He couldn't work.

566
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,408
Nobody wanted him.

567
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,869
So I let him stay
in the basement.

568
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,997
He helped out.
I'd give him a couple of dollars.

569
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,334
People throw things away,
he gets them.

570
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,462
She was a beautiful girl.

571
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,382
He was crazy about her.

572
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,804
I appreciate the way you deal
with people. I'm a big fan.

573
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,931
I enjoy appreciation.

574
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,977
I especially appreciated it when
you told that homeless schmuck...

575
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,605
Who does he think he is,
talking about the money you made?

576
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,773
Yeah, well, I...

577
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,193
Who was he to ask
Jack Lucas anything?

578
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,320
Asshole.

579
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,616
I did the same thing the other day.

580
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,702
It was perfect.

581
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,871
I listen to you every day.

582
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,583
You are a consistent,
integral man. I mean it.

583
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,293
What's the matter, baby?

584
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,919
Can't sleep?

585
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,758
Yeah.

586
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,678
I'll tell you something, Anne.

587
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,598
I really feel cursed.

588
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,892
Stop it.

589
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,768
Things will change.

590
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,105
I feel like I'm a magnet,
but I attract shit.

591
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,858
Out of all the people in this city,

592
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,360
why'd I meet a man
whose wife I killed?

593
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,697
You didn't kill anybody.
Stop it.

594
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,992
I wish there was
some way I could...

595
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:31,248
just pay the fine and go home.

596
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,757
I know, I know.

597
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,344
Oh, baby.

598
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,369
Have you seen Parry?

599
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,223
- Affliction thou hast
made me suffer.

600
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:34,061
Deign, princess, to remember thy slave
who endures misery for love of thee.

601
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,441
Uh... Parry.
Hi, Jack.

602
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,655
I thought you could use...

603
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,115
Come on.

604
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,078
Shh.

605
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,334
Oh... Uh... I'm sorry. I...

606
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,044
She'll be back.

607
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,054
Isn't she a vision?

608
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,473
Yeah, gorgeous.
I just wanted to...

609
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:12,683
Come on.

610
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,145
Wait, wait. Hey, look.

611
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,481
I'm leaving. I'm going.
I wanted to give you...

612
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,151
Shit!

613
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,946
Wait.

614
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,032
Now!

615
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,287
Here. Come here!

616
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,415
This way. Down!

617
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:40,836
Jack.

618
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,550
She buys a new book
every two days.

619
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,430
Sweetheart,
what the hell you doing?

620
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,933
She's into trash.
But what are you gonna do?

621
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,815
Jack.

622
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,321
Jack, come here.

623
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,865
Oh.

624
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,493
Oh, she loves dumplings.

625
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,953
That's the Wednesday ritual.

626
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,833
Oh, it's so sweet.
She does that every time.

627
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,006
We're looking through the window.
You got a problem with that?

628
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm looking through
the fucking window!

629
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,844
Jack
Come on, let's go.

630
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:40,270
If they said I'd love a girl who chews
jawbreakers, I'd say they were nuts.

631
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,147
But look at that jaw. Oh.

632
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,197
There she goes.

633
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,787
Oh.
You follow her every day, huh?

634
00:40:57,038 --> 00:41:00,082
Oh, it's not like that.
I'm deeply smitten.

635
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,501
What's her name?
I don't know.

636
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,170
A cooler! Oh.

637
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,965
Oh. This is beautiful. Needs work.

638
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,008
Here. Come here.

639
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,928
I just would like to help you.

640
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,722
Fifty dollars?

641
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,766
All right, here.

642
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,185
Here's another 20.
Will that do it?

643
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,104
Seventy dollars?

644
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,858
How much is this gonna take?

645
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,236
You're so nice, I...

646
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,989
Aw, Jack.
That's okay.

647
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,032
It's okay.

648
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,704
Hey, can I take you to lunch?
Huh?

649
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,873
No, I gotta go back to work.

650
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,168
Take care of yourself.

651
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:01,351
Sell!

652
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,858
Buy! Buy!

653
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,152
Buy!

654
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,486
Fuck them all!

655
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,323
What are you doing?
Give that back!

656
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,033
Jack! Jack! Jack!

657
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,077
What are you doing?
Jack, let go!

658
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,206
What the fuck are you doing?
Jack, why did you do that?

659
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,583
I gave that to you!
What am I gonna do...?

660
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,794
I don't know, but I gave it to you
to help you, not to help him.

661
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,757
Jack, do you really
wanna help me?

662
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,228
Okay, you can open your eyes.

663
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,146
Pretty impressive, huh?

664
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,733
As formidable as it seems,
everything has its weakness.

665
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,193
There's no moat.

666
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,905
You can't just break into
Langdon Carmichael's house.

667
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,241
He's done nothing...
I'll deal with it!

668
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,284
Let's go through this
again, okay?

669
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,912
Listen to me.
There is the Holy Grail...

670
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,623
Don't drool or roll your eyes
when I tell you this.

671
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,377
But you shouldn't be doing this.
There is no Holy Grail.

672
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,046
Jack, ye of little faith.

673
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,967
There has to be. What were the
Crusades, the Pope's publicity stunt?

674
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,636
You heathen, there's a Grail.
Come on.

675
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,639
Hey, hey. Wait, look. Wait a minute.
Hey! Ha-ha-ha.

676
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,266
You're only partly insane.

677
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,852
People like you can lead
semi-normal lives.

678
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,020
You can get a job.

679
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,982
I have a job, Jack.
I have a quest.

680
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,443
I take it back.
You're fucking deranged.

681
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,821
You'll get yourself killed
trying to get in.

682
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,490
That's so sweet.

683
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,326
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to protect me.

684
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,786
You think there's danger.

685
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:47,040
No, I think you're a moron,
and I don't want to get in trouble.

686
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,209
You care.

687
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,086
First the money, now this.

688
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:55,173
That's so sweet.
Oh, you fabulous guy, you...!

689
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,259
Don't hug me in public again.

690
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,177
"Men with men." Oh, Jack!

691
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:02,055
I love this guy!

692
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,350
You hear me?
I love this guy!

693
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,728
Oh, you hear me, jaded city?

694
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,605
- Will you shut up?
- I love Jack! He cares.

695
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:14,401
Oh, Jack, in this jaded
motherfucking city, that you...

696
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,652
Shut up!

697
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,323
You hear me? I'm loopy about this guy.
Oh, Jack.

698
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,492
Oh, you're a real human being.

699
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:25,370
You're a friend. A true friend.

700
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,582
I'm not. Believe me.

701
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,127
I'm scum.
Come on.

702
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,629
I won't listen.
You're a good guy.

703
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,090
I'm self-centered. I'm weak.

704
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,010
I don't have the willpower
of a fly on shit.

705
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,388
That's why the little people sent you.
It's magic...

706
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,184
I don't believe in
little floating people, okay?

707
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,394
There is no magic.

708
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,981
But you're still gonna help me.
That's what matters.

709
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,692
Parry. Parry,
or whatever your name is,

710
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,278
you know this isn't true,
the Grail, voices.

711
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,489
Part of you knows
it's not true!

712
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,574
We have to start planning now.

713
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,327
Parry, listen to me!
Jack, Jack.

714
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:06,787
You're acting weird.

715
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,373
I know who you are.

716
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,666
You're an intelligent...
Jack! Let go!

717
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,211
You used to teach
at Hunter College!

718
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,631
Parry, you're a teacher! Parry!
No! No!

719
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,813
Parry!

720
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,606
Aah!
Parry!

721
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,113
What are you looking at?

722
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,157
Parry.

723
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,163
Jack.

724
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,920
He's afraid of you.

725
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,675
We've got him!
Come on!

726
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,930
Holy shit!

727
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,099
Parry!

728
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:18,984
Parry!

729
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,534
Hey! Parry!

730
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,537
We got him, Jack!

731
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,548
Aha!

732
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,394
Parry.

733
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,191
Yes!

734
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,074
Whoa!

735
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:11,328
I've got you!

736
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,504
Aah!

737
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,820
I'm dying.

738
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,365
I can't breathe.

739
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,953
Isn't this a beautiful spot,
Jack?

740
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,373
Who have we been chasing?

741
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,416
Can I ask this question now?

742
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,294
He's gone now.

743
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,588
We had him on the run.

744
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,341
If we had horses,
we'd have had his ass.

745
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:07,551
Who?

746
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,969
What?

747
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,139
Who have we been chasing?

748
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,225
Jack, I thought
you saw him.

749
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,810
Saw who?

750
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,645
The Red Knight.

751
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,273
Okay.

752
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,902
I gave you the money.

753
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,405
You want to keep it, fine.

754
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,407
You want to give it away, fine.

755
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:35,161
I just want you to know I did
give him the money, okay?

756
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,913
Are we clear?

757
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,127
Who are you talking to, Jack?

758
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:48,258
Help me! Somebody, please!

759
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:52,137
Heaven be praised for an opportunity
to fulfill the duties of my profession.

760
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:59,853
These cries proceed from a miserable
male or female in need of my aid.

761
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,147
This is too hard.

762
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,150
Help me!

763
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:09,446
You lady on the horse,
please trample me!

764
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,157
Over here!
What are...?

765
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,411
No, no. Get away
from me! Get away!

766
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,955
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- I'm not gonna hurt you!

767
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,125
That's what the other guy said!
Leave me alone!

768
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:23,418
I want to help you.

769
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,880
No, I want to go.
Please, let me go now!

770
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,342
Scarecrow, they knocked
your stuffing out. Let me help.

771
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,845
No, I want a debutante
on a horse to step on me.

772
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,514
Parry.
Leave me alone.

773
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,309
Sorry, but the days
of debutantes are over.

774
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,269
Isn't it awful?

775
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,229
Poor little Gloria.

776
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,565
Poor Brenda Frazier.

777
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,902
They ruined them.
They ate them alive!

778
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,404
What about Slim Keith?
That Guggenheim girl?

779
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,908
Imposters!
Leave me alone.

780
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,284
Jack, lend a hand.

781
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,287
He needs to sleep it off.
Somebody'll take care of him.

782
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,540
Who? Mother Teresa?
She's retired. It's just us.

783
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:05,168
Maybe he wants to stay.
You want to stay?

784
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,922
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll just love
bleeding in horseshit.

785
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,800
How very Gandhi-esque of you.

786
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,260
Jack.

787
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,977
- No, please...
- Doctor!

788
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,648
I was born in a place like this.
I don't want to be here.

789
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,525
- Please, let me...
- Come on.

790
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,321
Take care of him.
No, no, no.

791
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,198
I want to go.
Please let me go.

792
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,075
Where do you want to go?

793
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:40,161
A nice place
that I know about.

794
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:41,746
We can go there later.

795
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,124
We can't go
there tonight.

796
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:48,336
Maybe. Where do you want to go?
We can't. No, we can't.

797
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,010
Hey, come on.

798
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,221
Where do you want to go?

799
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,473
Venice.

800
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,977
Like Katharine Hepburn
in Summertime.

801
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,522
Why can't I be
Katharine Hepburn?

802
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,442

803
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,986

00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,196
That's it!

805
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,656

Goddamn daughter-in-law.

00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,507
Comes in looking for dust balls.

813
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:38,178
Get the fuck out of
my dining room, you asshole!

814
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,638
Wonderful feeling,
but you're stretching.

815
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,683
Come on, tempo.
Allegro, people, allegro.

816
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,727
Okay.
Ahem. When you, um...

817
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,854
♪ I like New York in June ♪♪

818
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,775
Did you lose your mind
all of a sudden,

819
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,819
or was it a slow, gradual process?

820
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,115
Well...

821
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,744
I'm a singer by trade.

822
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,289
Summer stock, nightclub revues,
that sort of thing.

823
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:09,626
And God, I absolutely lived for it.

824
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:14,047
I can do Gypsy, every part.
I can do it backwards.

825
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,050
Then one night, in the middle
of singing "Funny,"

826
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,052
suddenly it hit me.

827
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,513
What does all this mean?

828
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:26,518
I mean, that, plus the fact
that I'd watched all my friends die.

829
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:32,106
Sound like a veteran,
don't I? Heh, heh.

830
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,359
- Fuck off!
- My dad would be so proud of me.

831
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:35,985
Hey.

832
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,530
- Pizza!
- About time.

833
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,261
Never gonna find her
in this crowd.

834
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:05,890
She's like clockwork. She comes
here at the same time every day.

835
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,559
She's late.

836
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,689
Thank you.

837
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,569
Parry. Parry.

838
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,530
Did you hear Jimmy Nickels
got picked up yesterday?

839
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:25,869
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

840
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,663
He got caught pissing
on a bookstore.

841
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,540
Man's a pig.

842
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,459
No excuse for that.
Thank you, babe.

843
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:37,630
We're heading for social anarchy
when people piss on bookstores.

844
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,509
Asshole.

845
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,761
Didn't even look at you.

846
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,432
Well, he's paying
so he don't have to look.

847
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,020
See, guy goes to work
every day,

848
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,105
eight hours a day,
seven days a week.

849
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,232
Gets his nuts so tight in a vice,

850
00:53:56,442 --> 00:54:00,361
he starts questioning
the very fabric of his existence.

851
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,072
Then one day,
about quitting time,

852
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,575
boss calls him in the office
and says,

853
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:09,954
"Hey, Bob, why don't you come
in here and kiss my ass for me?"

854
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,499
Well, he says, "Hell with it."

855
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,585
I don't care what happens.

856
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,589
I just want to see the expression
on his face

857
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,884
"as I jam this pair of scissors
into his arm."

858
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,263
Then he thinks of me.

859
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,766
He says, "Wait a minute."

860
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,310
I got both my arms.
I got both my legs.

861
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,979
"At least I'm not begging
for a living."

862
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:40,526
Sure enough, Bob's gonna put those
scissors down and pucker right up.

863
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,781
See, I'm what you call kind of
a moral traffic light, really.

864
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,701
I'm like saying,
"Red. Go no further.

865
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:52,038
Boop! Boop, boop, boop..."

866
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:15,598
I do not need this.

867
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,519
A woman my age.

868
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,314
I'm a person. There's a person here.
This is kid stuff!

869
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:27,068
You come, you go.
All I do is cook, like a jerk!

870
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,030
You waste a good lasagna.

871
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,573
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

872
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,660
I don't need this.
Find yourself another dope.

873
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,292
Son of a bitch.

874
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,473
God, what a beautiful night, Jack.

875
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,767
Don't you think
it's time to go now?

876
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,895
Running around
in the day is okay,

877
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,149
but at night, we could be
killed by a variety of people.

878
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,317
That's stupid, Jack.

879
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,155
This park is mine
as much as it is theirs.

880
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,574
Is it fair that they can
keep us out?

881
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,993
To make us think
we might get killed?

882
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,995
I think it's very fair.
I don't.

883
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,957
What are you doing?
I'm cloud-busting. You ever done it?

884
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:27,503
Lie back, concentrate on the clouds
and break them apart with your mind.

885
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,464
But you have to be nude.
You can't do this.

886
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,925
No one's allowed
to be naked

887
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,094
in a field in New York.
It's too Midwestern.

888
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,847
Come on, Jack. It's wild!
It's really freeing!

889
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,058
Your nipples are hard,
little guy's dangling in the wind.

890
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,186
Come on.
What are you afraid of?

891
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,687
You're pissing me off.

892
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,939
We're bare-assed naked
in the middle of it!

893
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,192
I'm not doing this.
This is nuts!

894
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,485
I'm leaving.
Free yourself!

895
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,280
You know why dogs do this?
Yow! It feels good!

896
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,865
I'm not doing that.

897
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,366
Yes, yo!

898
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,119
I'm leaving.
Come on.

899
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,288
Get back to your roots.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

900
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:06,292
The man talks to invisible people,
he sees invisible horses,

901
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,003
and he's lying naked
in the middle of Central Park.

902
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,131
I'm not surprised,
I'm out of my mind to be here!

903
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:14,050
Who are you talking to?

904
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,595
I'm talking to the little people!

905
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,013
Are they here?

906
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,058
They're saying,
"Jack, go to the liquor store,"

907
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:26,145
findeth the Jack of Daniels
that ye may be shitfaced!

908
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,980
"Doolang, doolang!"

909
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,273
They said that?

910
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,109
You are out of your fucking mind!

911
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,028
Bingo!

912
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:38,074
Come on. Free up the little guy.
Let him flap in the breeze.

913
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:41,827
Oh, Jack.

914
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,457
Nothing's happening.

915
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,917
Concentrate.

916
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,336
What if some
homophobic jogger runs by

917
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,922
and kills us to get back
at his father?

918
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:57,551
"Jack Lucas, found dead
next to a dead, naked man.

919
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:01,264
The two were dead.
His companion was naked."

920
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,102
I hate it when they use the word
"companion." It's so insinuating.

921
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,021
Probably boost the sales
of my biography.

922
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,607
The public has a fascination
with celebrity murders

923
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,526
that involve nakedness.
Bastards.

924
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,195
Jack, I may be going
out on a limb here,

925
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,198
but you don't seem
like a happy camper.

926
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,289
Did you ever hear the story
of the Fisher King?

927
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,165
No.

928
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:33,546
Begins with the king as a boy
having to sleep alone

929
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,341
in the forest to prove his courage
so he can become king.

930
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,886
While he's spending
the night alone,

931
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,432
he's visited by a sacred vision.

932
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:48,019
Out of the fire
appears the Holy Grail,

933
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,314
symbol of God's divine grace.

934
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,609
A voice said to the boy,
"You shall be keeper of the Grail

935
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,612
so that it may heal
the hearts of men."

936
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,992
But the boy was blinded by
greater visions of a life

937
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,745
filled with power
and glory and beauty.

938
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,499
And in this state
of radical amazement,

939
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:14,045
he felt for a brief moment,
not like a boy,

940
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,547
but invincible.

941
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,591
Like God.

942
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,969
So he reached in the fire
to take the Grail,

943
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,472
and the Grail vanished,

944
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:29,060
leaving him with his hand
in the fire to be terribly wounded.

945
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,813
Now, as this boy grew older,

946
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,608
his wound grew deeper.

947
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,235
Until one day,

948
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,364
life for him lost its reason.

949
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,534
He had no faith in any men,
not even himself.

950
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,828
He couldn't love

951
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,791
or feel loved.
He was sick with experience.

952
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,834
He began to die.

953
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:58,756
One day, a fool wandered
into the castle

954
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,549
and found the king alone.

955
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,971
And being a fool, he was simple-minded.
He didn't see a king.

956
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,099
He only saw a man alone

957
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,725
and in pain.

958
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:13,270
And he asked the king,
"What ails you, friend?"

959
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,523
And the king replied,

960
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,527
"I'm thirsty. I need
some water to cool my throat."

961
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:26,200
So the fool took a cup from beside
his bed, filled it with water

962
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,702
and handed it to the king.

963
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,455
And as the king began to drink,

964
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,542
he realized his wound
was healed.

965
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:37,670
He looked and there
was the Holy Grail,

966
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,005
that which he sought
all of his life.

967
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:41,966
He turned to the fool and said,

968
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:46,429
"How could you find that which
my brightest and bravest could not?"

969
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,973
The fool replied,

970
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,808
"I don't know.

971
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,353
I only knew that you were thirsty."

972
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,275
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

973
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:08,325
I think I heard that at a lecture once.
I don't know.

974
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,539
Some professor...

975
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,293
Heh, heh. At Hunt...

976
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,423
You all right?

977
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,550
Hunt...

978
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,014
Parry.

979
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,269
Hey, Parry.

980
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,439
Jack.
Hey.

981
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,986
How come you never ask
that girl for a date?

982
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,489
I can't ask,
I have to earn her.

983
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:50,659
Come on, this is the 20th century.
You don't have to earn a woman.

984
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,953
Maybe after we get the Grail.

985
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,372
But she could help you
get the Grail.

986
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:58,584
You know, I mean,
women are great.

987
01:03:58,835 --> 01:03:59,960
They make homes,

988
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,755
and they kill the livestock

989
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,257
so the knights can go out
and get Grails.

990
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,551
Slaughter villages
with a clear head.

991
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:11,096
Where would King Arthur be
without Guinevere?

992
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,265
Happily married,
probably.

993
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,936
Well, that's a bad example.
But trust me on this.

994
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:21,357
A woman who loves you keeps you
going, gives you strength.

995
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,068
Makes you feel like
you can do anything.

996
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,737
Is that what your girlfriend
does for you?

997
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,907
Sure, yeah.

998
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,369
Hm?

999
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,154
Get out of the
fucking way!

1000
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:35,347
Yes. Two Hearts Publishing?

1001
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,267
May I speak to Lydia, please?

1002
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,352
Lydia?
Who is Lydia?

1003
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,271
I don't know her last name.

1004
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:46,025
You are calling Lydia
from my apartment?

1005
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,319
You must think I'm some dope.
No, no.

1006
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,195
You son of a bitch!

1007
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:53,365
Her name is Lydia!
You stay out all night long.

1008
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,576
You stroll in here at noon.
Hey!

1009
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,786
You think I need this? I don't.
Lydia!

1010
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,830
No, no, no.
Oh, shit!

1011
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,793
I was not with a woman last night.
I was out with Parry!

1012
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,211
The moron?

1013
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:07,713
He's not a moron.

1014
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,049
Who's Lydia?

1015
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,761
Lydia is the girl that Parry likes.

1016
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,847
I thought...

1017
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,184
What?
You wouldn't understand.

1018
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:24,897
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
That pisses me off.

1019
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,941
I'm sorry.
I feel indebted to the guy, okay?

1020
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,234
What's that mean?

1021
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:31,779
There, you see?
What does it mean?

1022
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,949
I thought that if I could
help him in some way

1023
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,952
get him this girl that he loves

1024
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,038
that maybe, you know,

1025
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,165
things would change for me.

1026
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,466
Forget it. It's a dumb fucking idea.

1027
01:06:55,929 --> 01:07:00,099
You big galoot.
You are such a mess.

1028
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,689
Well, listen.

1029
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:10,234
Stranger things

1030
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,153
have been known

1031
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,282
to happen.

1032
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,878
♪ I've got the power ♪

1033
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,799
Hello? Hello?

1034
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,095
Who is this?

1035
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,180
Hello, Lydia.

1036
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:44,727
This is Jack Lucas.
I'm calling from Video Spot Video Rentals.

1037
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:48,856
Lydia, you are a major
credit-card holder, are you not?

1038
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:53,026
Lydia, Lydia, I've got
some good news for you.

1039
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:57,197
Of several credit-card holders, in
conjunction with several companies...

1040
01:07:57,449 --> 01:08:00,826
- Which ones? Which ones?
- All of them.

1041
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:05,038
Which means that you have just won
a free membership at our store.

1042
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,919
How did this happen?

1043
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,881
My name was...?

1044
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,968
Is my name on a list?

1045
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:21,305
Did you pick it out of a hat?
It was a list.

1046
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,099
Were a lot of people there?
Or just you?

1047
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,185
There were, uh...

1048
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,271
What's the difference?

1049
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,107
This phone...
I've never won anything in my life.

1050
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,610
And I don't even have a VCR...

1051
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,404
You'll get a free VCR
with a membership...

1052
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,740
For a short time,
until you get your own.

1053
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:42,868
Why don't you come on
down to the store,

1054
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,995
check it out,
see if you're interested?

1055
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:48,290
No. Did Phyllis tell you
to call me and...?

1056
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,043
Did Phyllis in Accounting do that?

1057
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:54,129
No, I told you,
you won a contest.

1058
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,048
You have just...

1059
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:03,889
This is gonna be rough.

1060
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,730
Shh, shh, shh.

1061
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,899
Well, I need to warm up.

1062
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:18,320
I'm Anne Morrow Lindbergh.
I can't find my baby.

1063
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,907
I knew I could make you smile.

1064
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,913
Look, one chorus
and then you're out of there.

1065
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,374
Jack, I'm a man with a mission.

1066
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:35,170
I can't believe I'm on a first-name
basis with these people.

1067
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,675
Can I help you?

1068
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:42,302
Is a mousy little woman
named Lydia here?

1069
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,929
Yes. If you wait, I'll get...

1070
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,556
No. It's a personal message.

1071
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,809
I have to give it to her in person.
You can't go back there!

1096
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,452
Jack. Jack.

1097
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,624
Yeah, this'll be good.

1098
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,918
You'll smell like a forest.

1099
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,193
Hello. My name is
Lydia Sinclair.

1100
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,654
Oh, hi. How you doing?

1101
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,574
Congratulations. Jack Lucas.
Nice to finally meet you.

1102
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,909
This is Anne Napolitano.
Video Spot owner.

1103
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:54,745
Hello.
Congratulations.

1104
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,247
And this is our coworker,

1105
01:12:57,832 --> 01:12:59,249
Parry. Parry...

1106
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,917
Parry Parry?

1107
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:03,003
No, just Parry.

1108
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,714
Oh. Like Moses.

1109
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,679
How do we do this?

1110
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:17,100
Well, first we'll have you sign out
an official membership card there.

1111
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:21,438
Sign that, if you would, and we'll
have that laminated for you.

1112
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:24,191
Would you like to laminate
Miss Sinclair's card?

1113
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:25,650
Oh, yeah.

1114
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,527
This will last you
for a year,

1115
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:31,698
after which you can renew, if you
wish, at a membership discount.

1116
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,992
Yeah, but not for free, right?

1117
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,327
Yeah.

1118
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:38,830
- You get 10 videos.
- Free?

1119
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,957
Free.
Only the first 10.

1120
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:44,169
After that,
they're 2.99 a rental.

1121
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,256
Jack. Jack.

1122
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,051
All right, all right. Go on.

1123
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,511
Go on.

1124
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,522
Can I help you?
No, no. I can look myself.

1125
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,065
Okay.

1126
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:19,454
Hell Merchants.
Good choice.

1127
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,124
I don't like horror movies.

1128
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,669
How about, uh...

1129
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,005
The Purple Bread?

1130
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:32,884
It's a big new Speizak's film.
Let's see.

1131
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:38,181
It's set against a sweeping
background of a polish bakery.

1132
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:42,185
Polish. That's a Polish bakery.
That's why it's in subtitles.

1133
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,397
Don't like love...
Polish love stories.

1134
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,566
I like musicals.
Musicals.

1135
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:49,901
Musicals?

1136
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,653
Over here.

1137
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:53,822
Here's our
entertainment center.

1138
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:56,658
Here's Fred Astaire.
That's good.

1139
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,827
Yeah, Jolson. Mammy.

1140
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,913
Have you got any Ethel Merman?
Ethel Merman?

1141
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,331
She's...

1142
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,253
Ethel Merman?

1143
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:12,799
We're all out of Ethel Merman.

1144
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,261
Ah...! What a gyp!
That sucks.

1145
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,640
I think I actually ordered
some just the other day.

1146
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,475
Did you or didn't you?

1147
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,061
Yeah.
They'll be in soon.

1148
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:27,939
Well...

1149
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,401
I'll come back then.

1150
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:32,819
Oh, uh...

1151
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,947
Miss Sinclair, your card.
Don't forget it.

1152
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:41,203
I like your nails.

1153
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,246
Where'd you get them done?

1154
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,748
Actually, I...

1155
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:48,251
I do them myself.
I used to work in a beauty parlor.

1156
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,296
- I like the stars.
- You know,

1157
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:54,925
Anne does other people.
Sort of as a sideline.

1158
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:56,927
She could do your nails.

1159
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,304
How much?

1160
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,349
Well, you're a member. We could...
Forty dollars.

1161
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,022
Forty dollars?

1162
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,191
Forty?

1163
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,697
Forty. For... Um...

1164
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:22,953
Okay.

1165
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:25,956
- When will you do them?
- I don't know. Next...

1166
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,457
Tonight?

1167
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:34,923
Tonight.

1168
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,060
Thank you.

1169
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,107
Jack, getting your nails
done is one thing,

1170
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,819
but going out to dinner
with strangers, and that one...

1171
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,863
We'll make it very casual.
She didn't look at him.

1172
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:00,198
It won't be a date.

1173
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,909
You got any more
starchy food?

1174
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:07,998
Oh, clumsy moi.

1175
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:16,256
Thank you.

1176
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:23,346
I've gone out with some bums,
but they were beautiful.

1177
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:25,849
That's the only reason
to go out with a bum.

1178
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:29,102
This food is delicious,
Anne. Really.

1179
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,981
You're a wonderful cook,
and you have a great set of dishes.

1180
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:36,318
Jack, he's trying to
start a conversation.

1181
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,404
Well, talk, then.
He's not gonna bite you.

1182
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,323
Thank you.

1183
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,241
You're welcome.

1184
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:44,409
You know,

1185
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,954
you are a beautiful woman.
You got your own business.

1186
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:52,292
I am surprised some guy doesn't
just snatch you up all for his own.

1187
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,210
Oh, you're surprised?

1188
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:58,131
Guess I never met the right guy.
What are you gonna do?

1189
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:01,551
No. I'm shocked.

1190
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,888
I mean, a childbearing
body like yours...

1191
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,807
A guy would have to be
out of his mind.

1192
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:09,851
Most guys are.

1193
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,104
No.

1194
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:14,898
You?

1195
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:18,610
This incredible woman going
to waste before my very eyes.

1196
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:21,654
No, this is outrageous!

1197
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,449
I will not hear this.
No! No, come on.

1198
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,410
Jack, get over here.
I am your man, then!

1199
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,704
Let's do it right here!

1200
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,499
Let's go to that place
of splendor in the grass!

1201
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,378
Behold my magic wand and free
your golden orbs right now!

1202
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,254
You know
what I'm saying.

1203
01:18:38,506 --> 01:18:40,298
What are you?
Out of your mind?

1204
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:43,134
♪ What a wonderful way
Of saying how much you... ♪♪

1205
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:45,804
Close your pants.
Took you long enough.

1206
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,597
What are you,
a 40 in a jacket?

1207
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,307
Yeah, that's it.

1208
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,184
This is gonna work.

1209
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,527
You let me know, because you're
too good a woman to go to waste.

1210
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:24,509
Oh.

1211
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,094
Welcome.

1212
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,637
Come in.

1213
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,102
I've never been in an apartment
above a store before.

1214
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:37,021
You always walk past them
on the street,

1215
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:40,358
but you never really think
anyone lives in them.

1216
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:50,785
Can I get you something?
A little coffee?

1217
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:54,539
A little tea? A little tequila?
No. Nope.

1218
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,719
Will it hurt?

1219
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,180
That all depends on you.

1220
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,474
You sure
you don't want a drink?

1221
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,018
Yes.

1222
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,979
You just enjoy this.
Thattaboy.

1223
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:21,024
This is mud.
We just washed that off.

1224
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:23,526
This is gonna
make you look great.

1225
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:25,820
It's good mud. Heh.

1226
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,323
Shh.
Shh.

1227
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:30,200
Close.
Mm-hm.

1228
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,076
Lips.
Mm.

1229
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,164
Heh. Jack.

1230
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,540
Close.

1231
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,791
What are you doing?

1232
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,378
There we go.

1233
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,715
Now, you just relax.

1234
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:50,428
So anybody special in your life?

1235
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:53,890
Does it look like there's
anybody special in my life?

1236
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,393
You don't have
to say it like that.

1237
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:00,688
It's not so, you know,
crazy an idea.

1238
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:04,025
You're healthy. You have a steady job.
You're not cross-eyed.

1239
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,694
Nope, there is nobody special.

1240
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,446
Okay, fine.

1241
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:14,619
I mean, it's not easy
in this day and age.

1242
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,496
What's not easy?

1243
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:20,875
Meeting people.
Oh, God. Tell me about it.

1244
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,586
I've been dating longer
than I've been driving.

1245
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,547
I can't believe that.

1246
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:32,136
I have never been through
a dating period.

1247
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,181
It's a disgusting process.

1248
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:37,600
You haven't missed a thing.

1249
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:39,686
Hold still.

1250
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:41,521
I'm so excited.

1251
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,401
Did you feel like this
when you first met Anne?

1252
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,445
She's a wonderful woman.
She loves you too much.

1253
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,948
But you love her too,
don't you?

1254
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,075
I mean, you know you do.

1255
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:56,744
It's just that you're
an asshole sometimes.

1256
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,204
Sorry.

1257
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,375
Thanks.

1258
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:08,673
My mother calls me once a week,
like an ongoing nightmare.

1259
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,925
"Have you met anyone?"
"No, Mom."

1260
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,636
"What's going to happen?"
"I don't know, Mom."

1261
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:16,347
Thank God I moved out
of that house!

1262
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:19,475
I cannot believe you lived
with her as long as you did.

1263
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:23,438
If I had to live with my mother,
I would stab myself six times.

1264
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:29,444
I think some people
are meant to be alone.

1265
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:31,779
This is my idea:

1266
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,907
That I was born a man
in a former life,

1267
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,869
and I used women for pleasure.

1268
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,495
So now...

1269
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,540
I'm paying for it.

1270
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,752
I wouldn't mind so much
if I could

1271
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:48,254
just remember the pleasure parts.

1272
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:52,342
I think you're getting
a little too complicated.

1273
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,302
What, in your opinion,

1274
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,638
is the actual problem?

1275
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,307
I don't make an impression
on people.

1276
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:04,854
At office parties,
I rearrange the hors d'oeuvres

1277
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:09,317
while people are eating them,
so that the platters will remain full.

1278
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:13,905
I never start any of the conversations,
because I just don't know...

1279
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:18,951
I don't know where
to make it end, to go.

1280
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:23,915
Listen, listen. You gotta be
a little easier on yourself, doll.

1281
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,625
A conversation

1282
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,919
has a life of its own,
you know?

1283
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,588
You have to have
some faith in that fact.

1284
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,632
I mean, look at us.

1285
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,759
We're having

1286
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:38,846
a very lovely conversation.

1287
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:40,515
I'm paying you.

1288
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:45,061
Will you stop it? I'm not like that.
I don't do people favors.

1289
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,522
If I talk to you,
it's because I want to.

1290
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,650
You're not a supermodel.
We can't all be Jerry Hall.

1291
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:54,028
What a boring world it'd be
if we were all Jerry Hall.

1292
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,489
You do the best you can
with what you got.

1293
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,741
You're not so invisible.

1294
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:01,035
Hey, you want
a personality?

1295
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,121
Try this on for size:

1296
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:06,082
You can be a real bitch.

1297
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,801
Really?
Yeah.

1298
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,515
Really?

1299
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,316
I'm gonna give you my wallet

1300
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,235
so you can pay for dinner.

1301
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:37,321
You're a nice man, Jack,
doing all this for me.

1302
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,409
I'm scared.
No, no, no.

1303
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,619
I mean, I feel
so much for her.

1304
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,955
I feel like something awful
is gonna happen.

1305
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:48,624
Nothing awful is gonna happen.
No, no, no.

1306
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:51,294
Anne is gonna be there.
I'm gonna be there.

1307
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,505
Nothing awful is gonna happen.
Okay?

1308
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:55,715
I'm still scared.

1309
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,425
I know. It's gonna be fine.

1310
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,427
Okay. All right.

1311
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,721
You're looking good.
You too.

1312
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:04,640
Just remember to breathe.
I gotta breathe.

1313
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,434
Big breaths.

1314
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:14,692
Anne? Anne? Anne?

1315
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,444
Oh. Oh, oh.

1316
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,696
- Aah!
- Hey, look! Lydia, how you doing?

1317
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:21,949
Parry, look. It's Lydia Sinclair,
our membership winner.

1318
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:23,367
I know.

1319
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:25,286
What have you fellas
been up to?

1320
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,206
Everything's locked up.
We thought we'd get some dinner.

1321
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,582
Oh.

1322
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,043
- Parry!
- Ja... Ow! Jack.

1323
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,713
Say, anybody up for Chinese?

1324
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,466
- Ooh. Ooh.
- Would you like to join us?

1325
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:39,675
No, thank you.

1326
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,428
Watch your nails.
I'd rather go home.

1327
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,556
Me too.
Parry, Parry, Parry. Come on.

1328
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,392
You still have to eat.
No, I'd like to...

1329
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:51,312
Don't blow this. Hey...

1330
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,148
I'd rather go home.
What'd I tell you? It's only dinner.

1331
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,734
Come on. You're gonna do this.

1332
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,320
You'll have something
to tell your mother.

1333
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,781
You are coming!

1334
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,117
Fine.

1335
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,374
What do you do?

1336
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:15,586
Well, I get to read
the book sometimes.

1337
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:18,881
But mostly, I calculate
production costs,

1338
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:24,971
Calculation costs

1339
01:26:25,222 --> 01:26:28,683
from first-edition hardcover to,
sorry, softcover.

1340
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,811
And after softcover,
it's somebody else's problem.

1341
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,021
Boy, that sounds
real exciting.

1342
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:37,066
Why does it sound exciting?
It's not exciting at all.

1343
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,693
Why not?

1344
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:44,365
Your calculations determine whether
a book is published or not.

1345
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:48,119
You know, maybe it's a book that
changes the way people think

1346
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,787
or, you know, act.

1347
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:54,166
Yeah, but what we publish is
mostly trashy romance novels.

1348
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:55,626
Don't say that.

1349
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,296
There's nothing trashy
about romance.

1350
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,341
In romance is passion.

1351
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:07,471
There's imagination.
There's beauty.

1352
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,183
Besides, you find

1353
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,186
some pretty wonderful things
in the trash.

1354
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,284
Ooh, dumplings.

1355
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,620
I could eat all of these.

1356
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:33,998
Would you like a dumpling?

1357
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,919
Some tea?
Yes, please.

1358
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:45,217
There you go.

1359
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:48,679
Parry.

1360
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,523
Oh.
Ooh.

1361
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,817
Ooh, boy.
Heh, heh, sorry.

1362
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:04,987
Oh. Hey.

1363
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:12,995
Sorry.

1364
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,256
It's hot.
Whew.

1365
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,646
Help her with that.

1366
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:50,783
Thanks.

1367
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:57,999
Excuse me.

1368
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,875
Excuse me.

1369
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,920
It's contagious.
What do you think?

1370
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,756
- Ha!
- It's good stuff, huh?

1371
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,510
I think that they were made
for each other.

1372
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,847
Scary, but true.

1373
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:15,516
You got it?

1374
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,436
You got it?
I got it. You got it.

1375
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,023
There it is. Okay.

1376
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,119

1397
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,829
Did you see her with the noodles?

1398
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,749
She had a noodle hanging
down her head!

1399
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,336
I couldn't believe it!

1400
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:13,467
Then they started in
on the dumplings.

1401
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,845
Playing hockey with it
on the table...

1402
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,180
It was broccoli!

1403
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,015
No, it was a dumpling.
Ha-ha-ha.

1404
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,977
They were batting it around
with chopsticks.

1405
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,647
Stop. I'm gonna lose it.
Wait, the burping...

1406
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,361
Yo, Lydia!

1407
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:33,988
Watch out! Hey.

1408
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:41,120
Tell me more about yourself.
I'd like to know everything.

1409
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,205
There's nothing more to tell.

1410
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:44,748
Oh, don't say that.

1411
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,501
No, that's it.
It's enough for me.

1412
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,879
I think she went for him.
I know.

1413
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,173
I can't believe I did it.

1414
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:55,926
What?

1415
01:31:56,178 --> 01:31:57,553
It's Latin.

1416
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,264
It means "love conquers all."

1417
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,391
I don't mean us.

1418
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,435
I mean everybody else.

1419
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,773
Do you think it'll work out?
Who knows? Who knows?

1420
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:13,861
Two people could be across from each
other and never find each other.

1421
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:17,198
Another two people could be
on opposite sides of the world

1422
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,700
and nothing could keep them apart.

1423
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,327
Who knows?

1424
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:24,872
The thing is, if a thing is
meant to happen...

1425
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,963
What?
Nothing. Go on.

1426
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:34,632
Wait a minute.

1427
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:37,801
You must be very
proud of yourself.

1428
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:41,764
You did a great thing
for somebody tonight.

1429
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,394
I was very proud to be
with you tonight.

1430
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:50,731
You were great.

1431
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,651
Thank you.

1432
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:07,831
You're welcome.

1433
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,966
Steamed dumplings.

1434
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,552
Moo Shu pork!

1435
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,556
You don't have to say that.

1436
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:26,642
I never say anything
I have to.

1437
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:30,354
No, I mean you don't have
to say nice things to me.

1438
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,732
It's old-fashioned, considering
what we're about to do.

1439
01:33:33,984 --> 01:33:36,527
What are we about to do?
You're walking me home.

1440
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:38,028
Mm-hm.

1441
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:41,532
I think you're
a little attracted to me.

1442
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,075
Yeah.

1443
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:51,125
And you'll probably want to come
upstairs for some coffee.

1444
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:52,668
I don't drink coffee.

1445
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,004
Then we'll probably have a drink.

1446
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:57,881
And talk
and get to know each other

1447
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,301
a little bit better, get comfortable.

1448
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:02,261
And then you'll...

1449
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,185
You'll sleep over.

1450
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,314
And in the morning, you'll awake,

1451
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,025
and you'll be distant.

1452
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:20,195
And you won't be able
to stay for breakfast.

1453
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:22,698
Maybe just a cup of coffee.

1454
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:24,575
I don't drink coffee.

1455
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,243
And then

1456
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,787
we'll exchange
phone numbers.

1457
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:31,040
And you'll leave...

1458
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:35,210
and never call.

1459
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:39,631
And I'll go to work
and I'll feel so good

1460
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:42,718
for the first hour, and then,

1461
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:46,889
ever so slowly,
I'll turn into a piece of dirt.

1462
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:56,482
I don't know why I'm putting myself
through this.

1463
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:04,990
It was really nice to meet you.

1464
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:08,786
Good night.

1465
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:10,871
Good night.

1466
01:35:12,499 --> 01:35:14,708
Excuse me! Wait, just...

1467
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:17,336
Hey! Sorry. Wait one minute.

1468
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,004
Excuse me. Please wait.

1469
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,424
I'm not feeling very well.
Well, no wonder.

1470
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,720
We just met, made love and broke up,
all in the space of 30 seconds.

1471
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:30,099
I don't remember the first kiss,
which I think is the best part.

1472
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:32,351
It was so very special
to meet you.

1473
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:36,313
It was for me too, but I think
it's time you should shut up now.

1474
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:37,689
Shut up.

1475
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:39,233
Please?

1476
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:47,574
I'm not coming up to your apartment.
That was never my intention.

1477
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:48,951
Oh.

1478
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,703
You don't want to.
Oh, no, I want to.

1479
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:55,290
I have a hard-on for you
the size of Florida.

1480
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:59,253
But I don't want just one night.

1481
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,258
I have a confession
I have to make to you.

1482
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:07,469
You're married? You're divorced?
No, no.

1483
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,055
You have a disease?
No, please stop.

1484
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:15,519
I'm in love with you.

1485
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:19,940
Shh.

1486
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,485
And not just from tonight.

1487
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:26,155
I've known you for a long time.

1488
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:31,994
I know that you come out from work
and fight your way out that door.

1489
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:35,122
You get pushed back in,
and then you come back out.

1490
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,083
I walk with you to lunch.
It's a good day

1491
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:41,253
if you stop and get that
romance novel at that stall.

1492
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,923
I know on Wednesdays,
you go to that dim sum parlor.

1493
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:49,720
And I know that you get a jawbreaker
before you go back into work.

1494
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:55,559
And I know you hate your job
and you don't have many friends.

1495
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,479
Sometimes
you feel uncoordinated

1496
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:01,815
and you don't feel as wonderful
as everybody else.

1497
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:05,986
Feeling as alone and separate
as you feel you are...

1498
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:14,536
I love you.

1499
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:18,957
I think you're the greatest thing
since spice racks.

1500
01:37:19,209 --> 01:37:22,461
I'd be knocked out if I could
just have that first kiss.

1501
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,172
And I won't be distant.

1502
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:28,926
I'll come back in the morning.
I'll call you, if you'll let me.

1503
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:33,305
But I still don't drink coffee.

1504
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:37,142
Shh.

1505
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,491
You're real...

1506
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,161
aren't you?

1507
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:09,800
Bye.

1508
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,302
It's the wrong door.

1509
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:18,559
You can call me.

1510
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,066
She didn't give me the number.

1511
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:18,035
No! No!

1512
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:21,580
Please, let me have this.

1513
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:29,546
Let me have it!

1514
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:29,583
Where are you?!

1515
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:44,765
We're tired of looking at you people!

1516
01:42:00,907 --> 01:42:02,449
Thank you.

1517
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,666
Ha, ha. Yeah, well,
I'm feeling good.

1518
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:13,960
I don't know how else to put it, Lou.

1519
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:18,965
Yeah, well, I had those
personal problems to work out.

1520
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:22,135
And I have, and now
I wanna get back to work.

1521
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:24,179
Do you think that's possible?

1522
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,933
Yeah, I understand.

1523
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:31,561
I am, yeah.

1524
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:34,815
I won't.

1525
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:37,943
I will.

1526
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,156
Great. When?

1527
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:46,535
Tuesday's fine.

1528
01:42:46,786 --> 01:42:49,412
Tuesday's great, Lou.
I'll see you then.

1529
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:51,957
Thanks a lot. Okay, bye.

1530
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:55,168
Who's Lou?
Lou is my agent.

1531
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,254
You're kidding.
I called my agent.

1532
01:42:57,505 --> 01:42:59,214
What did he say?

1533
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:02,884
He says that if I want to get
back to work, no problem.

1534
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:05,053
That I just come in

1535
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,223
and we talk and that's it.

1536
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:10,183
Oh, baby!

1537
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:11,977
That's terrific!

1538
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:14,896
I gotta get these tapes organized.
You seen my jacket?

1539
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:16,565
It's in the bathroom.

1540
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:19,442
The bathroom...
I got coffee here if you want.

1541
01:43:19,694 --> 01:43:21,361
You made coffee?

1542
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:25,073
You are going back to work
and you made coffee?

1543
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:27,158
I'm loving this.

1544
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:33,206
Oh, you know
what would be neat?

1545
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:36,751
Now that there's gonna be
another income coming in,

1546
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,170
I'd love to look
for a bigger place.

1547
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:41,756
I mean, I don't want
to rush anything,

1548
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:44,718
but I'd like to start
looking anyway, you know?

1549
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,344
Maybe a two-bedroom

1550
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:49,347
or maybe even
the top floor of a house?

1551
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:51,933
Say, in Brooklyn...

1552
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:53,435
Heights?

1553
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:57,606
What?

1554
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:00,734
You don't wanna commute, right?
That's all right. We could...

1555
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:02,402
Come here.

1556
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:06,197
You are an incredible woman.

1557
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:09,743
I'm an incredible woman?
What's this, a death sentence?

1558
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,829
No, no, I want to talk about this.

1559
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:16,374
So much has happened

1560
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:20,712
that I think it would be
a good thing for both of us

1561
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:22,631
if we...

1562
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:25,550
slowed down a little.

1563
01:44:25,927 --> 01:44:28,386
Slowed down?
Have we been going fast here?

1564
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:30,597
Now, look, this has been

1565
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:34,935
a real, real difficult time
for me this past year or so.

1566
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:39,314
I feel like I'm above water
for the first time.

1567
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:44,110
I feel like I know a lot more now, and I
don't want to make any more mistakes.

1568
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,404
I think I need time

1569
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:48,740
to make the right choices...

1570
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:50,867
Wait, wait. I'm lost here.

1571
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,286
I think that maybe I should...

1572
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,372
be alone for a while.

1573
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:01,753
Now that I know more,
you know, I feel

1574
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:08,093
that I should focus on my career
now that everything's taken care of.

1575
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:11,846
All right, first of all, let me
just say one thing, okay?

1576
01:45:12,098 --> 01:45:15,642
You don't know shit. Okay?

1577
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:17,477
Secondly,

1578
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:21,898
as far as we go, what have we
been doing here except time?

1579
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:25,402
Have I ever pressured you
once, ever?

1580
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,781
No. So, what time
do you need, baby?

1581
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:34,703
I love you, you love me.
You wanna get your career going?

1582
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:37,747
I think that's the greatest
thing in the world.

1583
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:40,834
I want to be there
when it happens.

1584
01:45:41,127 --> 01:45:44,587
So, what do you need time
to figure out, huh?

1585
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:50,844
All right, let me just
ask you one thing.

1586
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:54,305
Do you love me?

1587
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:58,351
I don't know.

1588
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:04,816
You can't even
give me that, can you?

1589
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:09,237
Jesus, Jack. What were you
planning on doing here?

1590
01:46:09,447 --> 01:46:12,741
Packing up and dropping me a note
when you met somebody new?

1591
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,243
I have no idea
what I was planning to do.

1592
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:16,953
I just said I need time.

1593
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:20,123
Bullshit! If you're gonna
hurt me, hurt me now.

1594
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:23,168
Not some long, drawn-out hurt
that takes months of my life

1595
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,670
because you don't
have the balls!

1596
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:31,092
Okay. I'll pack my stuff tonight.

1597
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:34,596
- What have you been doing here?
- Can you tell me that?

1598
01:46:34,764 --> 01:46:36,514
What have you been doing here?

1599
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:39,934
We both got something out of it.
What did I get?!

1600
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:41,770
What did I get?!

1601
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:44,981
What did I get I couldn't
have gotten from anybody

1602
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:46,983
any night of the week?!

1603
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:49,444
Do you think your company
is such a treat?

1604
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:52,155
Your moods, your pain,
your problems.

1605
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,032
You think
this has been entertaining?

1606
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,201
Then what do you
wanna stay with me for?

1607
01:46:59,038 --> 01:47:01,790
Because I love you.

1608
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:06,252
You stupid fucking...

1609
01:47:07,379 --> 01:47:09,589
Hey, hey.

1610
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:12,717
Anne.

1611
01:47:12,885 --> 01:47:14,511
Shh. Shh.

1612
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,054
Anne.

1613
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:29,109
No. Stop it, stop it. Don't.

1614
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,778
No, you don't get to be nice!

1615
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:36,866
I ain't gonna play a stupid game
where we act like friends

1616
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:40,161
so you get to walk out
feeling good about yourself.

1617
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,413
I'm not a modern woman.

1618
01:47:42,832 --> 01:47:44,707
If this is over,

1619
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:47,210
let's just call it over.

1620
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:14,237
Yeah? Yeah.

1621
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,325
My wallet? What do you mean?

1622
01:48:32,548 --> 01:48:33,840
Parry.

1623
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:37,760
Parry.

1624
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:42,098
Parry?

1625
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:43,933
He can't hear you.

1626
01:48:45,227 --> 01:48:48,730
I'm Dr. Mandeville.
I was on duty when they brought him in.

1627
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:53,776
I went over his record.
He was brought in once before.

1628
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:57,488
Catatonic stupor,
condition rendered him nonverbal.

1629
01:48:57,698 --> 01:48:59,616
Yeah. So he's
been beat up.

1630
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,035
He's got a concussion,
right?

1631
01:49:02,995 --> 01:49:05,205
Right? He's gonna snap out of it.

1632
01:49:05,456 --> 01:49:07,207
I'm afraid not.

1633
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,251
The beating's bad,
but it's not the problem.

1634
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:13,004
He seems to be
re-experiencing catatonia.

1635
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:15,465
Like before, he could
snap out of it in an hour,

1636
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:18,259
or 13 months, 13 years.

1637
01:49:21,138 --> 01:49:23,139
There's no way to be sure.

1638
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:29,646
A person could re-experience
the full effect of a tragedy

1639
01:49:29,855 --> 01:49:32,106
long after
the event took place.

1640
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:35,026
I was reading
how he lost his wife.

1641
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:37,320
Are you relatives?

1642
01:49:38,656 --> 01:49:41,491
Well, it doesn't matter.
We'll take care of him.

1643
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:44,827
He'll have to be sent back
to the same institution.

1644
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:48,957
What if I was a relative?

1645
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:51,960
You'd have the option
to care for him at home.

1646
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:56,256
My advice is, I wouldn't recommend it.
It wouldn't be good for him.

1647
01:49:56,465 --> 01:49:58,591
He needs hospital care.

1648
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:02,262
I thought you could sign the release
forms, but the city can do that.

1649
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:05,473
I'm sorry.

1650
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,563
Poor Lydia.

1651
01:50:13,148 --> 01:50:16,734
She finally finds her prince
and he falls into a coma.

1652
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:20,488
Some women just have
no luck, huh?

1653
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:30,039
Anne. Anne.

1654
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,292
Anne.

1655
01:50:41,927 --> 01:50:43,845
I'll call you, okay?

1656
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,394
Two dwarfs and a melon.

1657
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:54,605
Have a perfect weekend.
And remember, on Monday

1658
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:57,442
we have as our special guest,

hit TV show On the Radio.

1660
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:05,992
From one of the botched to all of you
bungled cats out there, I love you,

1661
01:51:06,243 --> 01:51:07,702
and right back at you.

Yeah, Lou. Look, I said I want
an offer or they can forget it.

1666
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:25,011
Uh-huh. Tell them I'm talking to the
cable people about a talk show.

1667
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,596
What?

1668
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:29,932
Beth's father set it up.

1669
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:32,101

Hey, come on. Come on.

Jack, can I talk to you, please?

1680
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:11,766
I need to talk...

1681
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,352
- We spent time together.
- Let's go.

1682
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:17,897
Please let me talk to him.
Do you know this guy?

1683
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:20,274
Why won't you talk to me?

1684
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:22,276
Leave me alone!

1685
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:24,529
Jack!

1686
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:26,656
♪ I've got the power ♪♪

1687
01:52:26,865 --> 01:52:29,283
It's a weekly comedy
about the homeless.

1688
01:52:29,535 --> 01:52:31,244
But it's not depressing
in any way.

1689
01:52:31,453 --> 01:52:34,163
We want to find a funny,
upbeat way

1690
01:52:34,415 --> 01:52:37,125
of bringing the issue
of homelessness to television.

1691
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:41,587
So we've got three wacky
homeless characters.

1692
01:52:42,047 --> 01:52:44,799
But they're wise.
They're wacky and wise.

1693
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,926
The hook is
they love being homeless.

1694
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:49,387
They love the freedom,
the adventure.

1695
01:52:49,638 --> 01:52:53,975
It's about the joy of living,
Money, politics.

1696
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:58,354
And the best part is,
it's called Home Free.

1697
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:01,482
Ooh. I'm getting a rush.

1698
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:05,111
Oh. Really.

1699
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:07,405
Is this another disappearing act
with this guy?

1700
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:11,534
No. It's not a problem.
It's a bathroom break.

1701
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:13,161
I'll check.

1702
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,009
Shit!

1703
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:36,559
Oh, Parry.

1704
01:53:36,727 --> 01:53:39,437
- There.
- What?

1705
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:42,773
It's a Grail.

1706
01:53:43,192 --> 01:53:45,485
The Holy Grail.

1707
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:47,778
The Holy...

1708
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:53,451
Some billionaire has got the Holy
Grail in his library on Fifth Avenue?

1709
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,788
I know. Who'd think you'd
find anything divine there?

1710
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:02,752
They said

1711
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:04,670
you're the one.

1712
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,047
Henry Sagan?

1713
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:06,232
Pardon me. Not long ago,
I left some new sheets for Parry.

1714
01:55:06,483 --> 01:55:10,278
They were lime-colored, much like
this color, with watermelons.

1715
01:55:10,529 --> 01:55:13,406
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
They're being cleaned.

1716
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:16,242
The doctor had a little
accident with the hypo.

1717
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:19,662
Just make sure that he does
get them when they are clean.

1718
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,205
Thank you.

1719
01:55:32,593 --> 01:55:34,552
Guys, settle down.

1720
01:55:43,562 --> 01:55:46,230
Hi. It's Jack.

1721
01:55:49,234 --> 01:55:51,444
How you doing?
You're looking good.

1722
01:55:51,903 --> 01:55:53,321
You do.

1723
01:55:56,158 --> 01:55:57,491
Hey.

1724
01:56:03,415 --> 01:56:05,541
You gonna wake up for me? Hm?

1725
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:24,602
This isn't over, is it?

1726
01:56:26,772 --> 01:56:29,440
You think you'll make me
do this, don't you?

1727
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:32,109
Well, forget it. No fucking way.

1728
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,446
I don't feel responsible for you
or for anybody.

1729
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:39,241
Everybody's got bad things
that happen to them. I'm not God.

1730
01:56:39,493 --> 01:56:41,077
I don't decide...

1731
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:45,081
People survive.

1732
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:51,253
Say something!

1733
01:57:02,224 --> 01:57:04,475
Everything's been going great.

1734
01:57:04,685 --> 01:57:05,893
Great.

1735
01:57:07,354 --> 01:57:09,647
I'm gonna have
my own cable talk show.

1736
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,190
Mm-hm.

1737
01:57:11,358 --> 01:57:14,235
With an incredible equity,
I might add.

1738
01:57:14,736 --> 01:57:19,031
I've got an incredible...
Incredibly fucking gorgeous girlfriend.

1739
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:22,368
I'm living an incredible
fucking life.

1740
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:26,247
So don't lay there
in your comfortable coma

1741
01:57:26,498 --> 01:57:30,126
and think I'm gonna risk all that
because I feel responsible for you.

1742
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:32,753
I'm not responsible!

1743
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:38,384
I don't feel guilty.
You've got it easy. I'm out there,

1744
01:57:38,593 --> 01:57:40,720
every fucking day

1745
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:43,639
trying to figure out
what the hell I'm doing.

1746
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:47,184
No matter what I have,
it feels like I have nothing.

1747
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:53,441
I don't feel sorry for you.
It's easy being nuts. Try being me.

1748
01:57:58,113 --> 01:57:59,739
So I won't do it.

1749
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:02,199
I don't believe in this shit.

1750
01:58:04,995 --> 01:58:07,621
Don't give me that stuff
about me being the one.

1751
01:58:07,873 --> 01:58:09,498
There's nothing,

1752
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:12,209
nothing special about me.

1753
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:16,589
I control my own destiny,

1754
01:58:17,299 --> 01:58:20,176
not some floating,
overweight fairies.

1755
01:58:20,385 --> 01:58:23,929
I decide what I'm gonna do,
and I'm not gonna risk my life

1756
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:27,683
to get some fucking cup
for some fucking vegetable!

1757
01:58:27,893 --> 01:58:29,602
Motherfucker!

1758
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:31,228
What am I supposed to do?!

1759
01:58:34,316 --> 01:58:41,322
What am I supposed to do?

1760
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:44,116
Cup...

1761
01:58:50,916 --> 01:58:53,667
All right, for sake of argument,
let's say I do do this.

1762
01:58:53,835 --> 01:58:57,046
Okay? If I do this,

1763
01:58:58,298 --> 01:59:02,218
I want you to know it wouldn't be
because I felt I had to

1764
01:59:02,385 --> 01:59:05,763
or because I felt cursed
or guilty or responsible.

1765
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:07,681
If I do this...

1766
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,937
Shit.

1767
01:59:17,943 --> 01:59:19,985
If I do this,

1768
01:59:20,487 --> 01:59:22,279
and I mean if...

1769
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:27,910
it's because I want to do this
for you.

1770
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:30,204
That's all.

1771
01:59:31,289 --> 01:59:32,873
For you.

1772
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:42,716
Don't go anywhere.

1773
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:03,612
Shit!

1774
02:00:42,861 --> 02:00:44,236
Great.

1775
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:51,118
I'm hearing horses now.
Parry will be so pleased.

1776
02:00:52,329 --> 02:00:55,289
Radio personality turns screwball
on mission from God.

1777
02:00:57,208 --> 02:00:59,168
I just hope when they put me away,

1778
02:00:59,419 --> 02:01:02,171
they find me a place
right next to his.

1779
02:01:06,051 --> 02:01:07,509
Okay.

1780
02:01:48,426 --> 02:01:49,927
Fuck!

1781
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:08,278
Thank God nobody looks up
in this town.

1782
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:40,394
Shit.

1783
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:22,996
"Lannie Carmichael.

1784
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:26,667
Christmas 1932."

1785
02:04:46,771 --> 02:04:48,230
Shit.

1786
02:04:48,857 --> 02:04:53,026
Hey. Hey, come on. Wake up!

1787
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:01,577
Christ!

1788
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:03,096
All right, I did my side
of the bargain.

1789
02:06:05,892 --> 02:06:07,684
Here's your cup.

1790
02:06:12,148 --> 02:06:13,941
You gonna wake up now?

1791
02:06:23,159 --> 02:06:25,827
You want to think about it
a little more.

1792
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:28,664
Okay.

1793
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,501
Take your time.

1794
02:07:51,164 --> 02:07:53,415
I had this dream, Jack.

1795
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:55,917
I was married.

1796
02:07:57,503 --> 02:08:00,630
I was married
to this beautiful woman.

1797
02:08:02,759 --> 02:08:04,676
And you were there too.

1798
02:08:08,097 --> 02:08:10,724
I really miss her, Jack.

1799
02:08:12,435 --> 02:08:14,269
Is that okay?

1800
02:08:15,813 --> 02:08:18,023
Can I miss her now?

1801
02:08:21,319 --> 02:08:22,903
