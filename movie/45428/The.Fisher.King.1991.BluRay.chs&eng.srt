I'm leaving. Come on.

Get back to your roots. Ooh, ooh, ooh!

1004
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:06,827
他和看不到的人说话
The man talks to invisible people, he sees invisible horses,

1005
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:09,538
又赤裸裸躺在中央公园
and he's lying naked in the middle of Central Park.

1006

1010

They're saying, "Jack, go to the liquor store,

1011
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:26,687

1012

-他们这样说？ -你疯了
Doolang, doolang!"

1013
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:29,773
他们说了这些？
They said that?

1014

PARRY: Concentrate.

1022
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:50,872
如有人杀了我们会怎样？
JACK: What if some homophobic jogger runs by

1023
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:53,464
然后回去说：
and kills us to get back at his father?

1024
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:58,090
“杰克卢卡和裸男死在一起”
"Jack Lucas, found dead next to a dead, naked man.

1025
00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:01,800
他俩都死了，他的同伴赤裸
The two were dead. His companion was naked."

1026
01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:06,640
我讨厌“同伴”，像别有意思
I hate it when they use the word "companion." It's so insinuating.

1027
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:09,568
但那会使我的自传畅销
Probably boost the sales of my biography.

1028
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:14,527
大家喜欢名人的死涉及这种事
The public has a fascination with celebrity murders

1029
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,526
that involve nakedness. Bastards.

1030
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,195
Jack, I may be going out on a limb here,

1031
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,743
我可能错了，但你像不快乐
but you don't seem like a happy camper.

1032
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,829
你听过“国王与圣杯”？
Did you ever hear the story of the Fisher King?

1033
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,165
No.

1034
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,084
他还是小孩时，曾夜探森林
Begins with the king as a boy having to sleep alone

1035
01:00:34,302 --> 01:00:37,884
在森林证明他的勇气最后成为国王
in the forest to prove his courage so he can become king.

1036
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,430
他独自一人，见到神圣的幻象
While he's spending the night alone,

1037
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:44,972
他有一种神圣的幻觉
he's visited by a sacred vision.

1038
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:48,563
神圣的圣杯在火中出现
Out of the fire appears the Holy Grail,

1039
01:00:49,151 --> 01:00:51,855
有神的光环
symbol of God's divine grace.

1040
01:00:53,113 --> 01:00:56,149
并有声音说
A voice said to the boy, "You shall be keeper of the Grail

1041
01:00:56,408 --> 01:00:59,159
“你会有可医治心灵的圣杯”
so that it may heal the hearts of men."

1042
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:03,538
但他的心正沉醉于权力、名声
But the boy was blinded by greater visions of a life

1043
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:06,286
装满权利光荣美女
filled with power and glory and beauty.

1044
01:01:08,212 --> 01:01:11,047
他非常惊讶
And in this state of radical amazement,

1045
01:01:11,673 --> 01:01:14,590
并觉得自己不像小孩
he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy,

1046
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:17,092
但不可征服
but invincible.

1047
01:01:17,596 --> 01:01:19,138
而像神
Like God.

1048
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:22,514
他伸手去取圣杯，它消失不见
So he reached in the fire to take the Grail,

1049
01:01:23,102 --> 01:01:25,011
圣杯消失了
and the Grail vanished,

1050
01:01:25,854 --> 01:01:29,602
他的手在火中严重烧伤了
leaving him with his hand in the fire to be terribly wounded.

1051
01:01:31,068 --> 01:01:33,356
他越长大
Now, as this boy grew older,

1052
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,153
伤口越深
his wound grew deeper.

1053
01:01:37,074 --> 01:01:38,781
直至一天
Until one day,

1054
01:01:39,493 --> 01:01:41,900
生命对他失却意义
life for him lost its reason.

1055
01:01:43,122 --> 01:01:46,076
他对人没有信心，对自己也是
He had no faith in any men, not even himself.

1056
01:01:46,792 --> 01:01:48,369
他不能去爱
He couldn't love

1057
01:01:48,961 --> 01:01:52,330
也不能被爱
or feel loved. He was sick with experience.

1058
01:01:53,216 --> 01:01:55,089
他厌恶自己的人生，快要死了
He began to die.

1059

[???]

1060
01:01:56,385 --> 01:01:59,302
一天，有一个蠢人走进皇宫
One day, a fool wandered into the castle

1061
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:01,091
他所看到的不是国王，只是人
and found the king alone.

1062
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:06,515
像个傻瓜，他没看到国王
And being a fool, he was simple-minded. He didn't see a king.

1063
01:02:06,729 --> 01:02:08,638
只看到一个人
He only saw a man alone

1064
01:02:08,856 --> 01:02:10,266
在痛苦中
and in pain.

1065
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,817
他问国王“你怎么了？”
And he asked the king, "What ails you, friend?"

1066
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:16,064
国王回答说
And the king replied,

1067
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:20,065
“我很渴”我要一些水
"I'm thirsty. I need some water to cool my throat."

1068
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:26,738
那人就倒了一杯水
So the fool took a cup from beside his bed, filled it with water

1069
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,242
交给了他
and handed it to the king.

1070
01:02:29,836 --> 01:02:31,994
国王开始喝
And as the king began to drink,

1071
01:02:32,213 --> 01:02:35,083
他感到伤口在痊K
he realized his wound was healed.

1072
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:38,212
手中拿的就是圣杯
He looked and there was the Holy Grail,

1073
01:02:38,428 --> 01:02:40,550
一生追求的圣杯
that which he sought all of his life.

1074
01:02:40,764 --> 01:02:42,507
他惊讶地说：
He turned to the fool and said,

1075
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:46,977
“你怎找到连我最勇敢的人都找不的杯子？”
"How could you find that which my brightest and bravest could not?"

1076
01:02:48,021 --> 01:02:49,515
那人说我不知道
The fool replied,

1077
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:51,355
我不知道
"I don't know.

1078

我只知道你很渴
I only knew that you were thirsty."

They make homes,

他们会杀家禽
and they kill the livestock

1098
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:05,802
所以骑士们能去得到圣杯
