2
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:45,070
How's it going? Is it close to Ho Chi Minh City

3
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,406
The perfect resort for Boss Choi

4
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:49,950
Why is development slow here

5
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:52,327
It used to be a semiconductor factory

6
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:55,539
The project was approved as a tourist destination when they heard it was closed

7
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,041
Look at the location and the view

8
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:00,669
I'm sure a lot of tourists will come once the development starts

9
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:04,172
Who did you say I was meeting today

10
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,591
He's the head of a car rental agency

11
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,051
He said he must meet President Choi

12
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:09,970
How much did you charge

13
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:12,305
For what? - For what

14
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:14,474
Is that what you think I am

15
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:15,809
What do you take me for

16
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:19,437
He'd do anything to hang out with you

17
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,944
Cui presidents

18
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,945
Are you sober

19
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,614
How the hell did that drink cost so much yesterday

20
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:32,951
I had the honor to drink wine Louis XIII for the first time yesterday with the light of Cui's boss

21
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,786
Why did you let him do that

22
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,954
I should have stopped him

23
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,539
Don't you make a lot of money, too

24
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,166
I made a lot of money

25
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,292
But we need to spend our money wisely

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,295
Don't spend money on booze every fucking day

27
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,130
Come on, let's get this day over with and get a hangover

28
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:48,216
He begged me for hours to see you in person

29
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:49,217
I hear he's got a lot of money

30
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:51,428
Well, he's not just dealing with Koreans

31
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,097
There are many buildings in Ho Chi Minh City

32
00:02:58,186 --> 00:02:59,227
you

33
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:00,270
The boss is Choi Yong-ki

34
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:01,396
Is my hello

35
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,190
I've heard so much about you

36
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:04,483
Please get on the bus

37
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,984
Well, you guys talk

38
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,154
Don't you hot

39
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,822
You're eating a cookie

40
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:13,909
Why don't you eat something good

41
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,502
I heard what Jonghoon said

42
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,421
He said you ran a pretty big car rental business

43
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:27,797
I hear you have a lot of money

44
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:28,798
what

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,051
You his mama

46
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:33,261
You son of a bitch

47
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:45,649
- Oh, it's hot. - Hey, what the fuck are you doing

48
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,526
What are you doing, son of a bitch

49
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,027
Get out of the way points

50
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,908
Do I look like I run a car rental agency to you

51
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:08,255
You were kidnapped

52
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:16,930
Hey, you son of a bitch put that knife down

53
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,181
Hey, put the knife down, boy

54
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,433
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - I didn't say that

55
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,601
I'm the fucking shin of Yeongdeungpo

56
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:22,561
I know, I know

57
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,229
- Said he knew, boy. - What's he talking about

58
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:25,355
What the hell do you know

59
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:27,857
- Hey. - Leave the girl alone, boy

60
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,192
What the fuck?

61
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,486
- Don't fucking touch me. - Come on

62
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,321
Get over here and I'll give you a fucking knife

63
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:35,949
Why the fuck are you not answering your phone again

64
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:38,368
Oh, oh, here, here

65
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,289
It's this way

66
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:43,957
- There you are. - Here, here

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,166
Hello? Where? Where?

68
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,627
- In there. - No, I mean tin channel. Where is he

69
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:49,588
He's not answering his phone

70
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:50,839
This his mama

71
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,386
Get over here, get over here

72
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,513
I need you to put that knife down

73
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:02,517
You are here

74
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,519
What's the

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,854
What took you so long to get here

76
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,940
Oh, I went on that blind date thing

77
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,483
What kind of blind date goes on once a week

78
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,652
Well, he has to get married, too

79
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:13,695
What's wrong with him

80
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:15,905
Young Shin named Yeongdeungpo is a total lunatic

81
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,240
- New? - You sons of bitches

82
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,992
- Just escaped from a mental hospital. - Don't worry about me

83
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:19,909
The hostage?

84
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:22,370
The shopkeeper's aunt and a college girl altogether two

85
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:23,622
Hey, man, why don't we just break in

86
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,081
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

87
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,709
It's too dangerous. Maybe we should call it suppression

88
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,919
Now we don't know what this maniac is capable of

89
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,129
Where are all of us

90
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:34,049
Hey, keep your hands down and there's a lot of people watching

91
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:35,759
You puppies

92
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,136
Do you know how hard it is for the yakuza

93
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,055
Calm down, calm down

94
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:42,682
What's wrong with your mother

95
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,017
Can't cook

96
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:44,976
- What are you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa

97
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,686
Yeah, you must be tired

98
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,314
Get the fuck over here

99
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:50,648
Watch out. I gave you all the knives

100
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,361
Where are you from

101
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:58,990
Oh, shit.

102
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:00,867
Oh, my god

103
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:02,327
hello

104
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:04,788
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

105
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,164
- What are you doing, man? - What

106
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,374
- Come here and talk. - Why

107
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,292
yeah

108
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:11,044
- Stay away. - Not you

109
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:12,420
- Stay the fuck away. - Wait, wait, wait

110
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,672
This is dangerous

111
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,839
Hey, you boy

112
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,591
Is it the first time you've seen me and the first time I've seen you

113
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:17,926
what

114
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:18,927
Can you believe me

115
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,470
I don't fucking believe that

116
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,430
Danger put the knife down

117
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,932
I told you to put the fucking knife down

118
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,979
- Hey, get the men out of here. - Yeah

119
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,564
- Hong Seok. - Get out, get out

120
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,732
To this to this

121
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,275
Hurry up

122
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:35,568
Get them in the car

123
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,320
- Get your hands off me. - Hey, boy

124
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:38,905
If you stab someone with a knife

125
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:40,573
You say it hurts you say it hurts

126
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:42,242
- Does it hurt? - It hurts

127
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:43,701
Smelly boy

128
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:44,869
Give me up

129
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,791
You fucking

130
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,000
What the fuck

131
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:53,628
You fucking

132
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,255
You're not a zombie

133
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:00,718
Come here please don't take pictures

134
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:02,053
Come here please don't take pictures

135
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,889
Excessive police repression hospitalized for 12 weeks

136
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,224
Excessive police repression hospitalized for 12 weeks

137
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,142
Excessive police repression hospitalized for 12 weeks

138
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:10,353
What kind of excessive repression is that

139
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:12,647
In front of some lunatic with a knife

140
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:15,024
Is the police going to make a deal and say, Sir, please calm down

141
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,235
I told you how good you were doing and gave you thumbs up

142
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,194
These guys are still writing stories like this

143
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:18,653
These guys are still writing stories like this

144
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:21,114
ok

145
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:22,574
I had my eyes covered and I didn't know it was me

146
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,701
Hey eee, you should cover up

147
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,411
You can't tell

148
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:27,912
- Tell me the truth. - What

149
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:30,331
Anyone would think you were a criminal based on your face

150
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:31,833
Boy's got a lot of nerve

151
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:32,917
No more our big brother

152
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:35,378
Kind of a Russian mob vibe

153
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,629
Hey, hey, if you say that

154
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,506
Your class leader and the others have more

155
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:39,841
He's just a terrorist

156
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,887
His face has been growing down since high school

157
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,430
- Don't you think so? - Yeah

158
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,432
There is a feeling of standing in the community of changsheng column

159
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,808
You know what I mean

160
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,477
It feels like yesterday's length is different than today's

161
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:52,479
- Don't you think so? - That's when I first met the squad leader

162
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,272
- Quiet, quiet. - Almost put the cuffs on him

163
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,024
Be quiet with your buttoned-up cuffs

164
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:00,153
Interesting?

165
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,323
Was it that much fun?

166
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,533
You have come

167
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:07,202
It's

168
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:10,038
You seem pretty happy to be in the news

169
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,290
I am hard luck!

170
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,793
I just should

171
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,838
- Ugh. - What a terrible thing to be called

172
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,174
I'll go and plead with the chief and come back

173
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,802
That's it. That's it

174
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,678
You should go to Vietnam

175
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,096
- Vietnam. - Vietnam for what

176
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:28,515
Meet Yoo Jong-hoon

177
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:30,350
- I don't know who. - Isn't that who

178
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:32,644
The same guys who robbed the gold and silver store in Garifong last year

179
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:33,645
This is the boy on the lookout

180
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:34,229
This is the boy on the lookout

181
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,147
Oh, yeah, yeah, this guy got it

182
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,649
For he is

183
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,151
He turned himself in in Vietnam for stealing gold and silver

184
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,320
- Why? - I don't know

185
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,738
So you're in charge of bringing him in

186
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:45,824
Think of it as a business trip for two days and three nights

187
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,284
Haven't been abroad for a long time

188
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,244
- Who are you going with? - Dude

189
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,621
My dad was a Vietnam warrior

190
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,122
It should be me, the son, this time

191
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:54,791
Big brother my sister's brother's friend's

192
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,210
- Best friend lives in Vietnam. - What's wrong with this guy

193
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,003
- I'll try. - You son of a bitch

194
00:08:59,046 --> 00:08:59,754
You had nothing to do with this

195
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,214
- You want to put your hands down? - Feed you guys

196
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,968
What do you think this is for fun

197
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:06,761
We're on our way to pick up a murderer

198
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:08,763
This is very important shit

199
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,849
I go with him

200
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,851
cut

201
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,852
- Wait, wait, wait. - What

202
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,353
How are we supposed to go with each other

203
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,480
- We need someone who speaks English. - English

204
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:18,481
Monitor do you speak English

205
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,859
- Are you talking to me about English now? - Tell me

206
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:23,987
I'd like a salad, but

207
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,952
- Is that all right? - You speak English so well

208
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:32,370
yeah

209
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,163
If you go abroad with me

210
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,415
Everything is ok

211
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,459
All right, all right, all right, I'm done talking to you

212
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,586
Just trust me and come with me

213
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:41,129
Wow, our monitor is really decent

214
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,348
Yo! Fuck

215
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:54,225
Didn't you say it was okay to go with you

216
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,688
They don't understand British pronunciation at all

217
00:09:58,689 --> 00:09:59,772
Aye yo mama

218
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,525
I knew something was wrong when you said what kind of vinegar

219
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,404
I just wanted to see Vietnam

220
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:08,865
That what the hello

221
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:10,658
hello hello

222
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:12,243
That what I

223
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,203
We are the police in Korea

224
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:15,246
The police

225
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,249
We're too busy to leave now

226
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:19,959
Out right Out

227
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,753
quiet

228
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:26,174
- You don't understand a word of fucking English. - Don't call me names

229
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,092
I can understand Korean

230
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:29,636
sit

231
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,680
I sit down first

232
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,099
I'm sorry

233
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,189
thank you

234
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,316
Alas!

235
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:44,150
I'm running a little late

236
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:47,153
I am Park Chang-soo, police resident officer at the Korean Consulate General

237
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,237
-Uh-oh

238
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,656
Nice to see you

239
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:51,199
I am the full-time monitor of Jinchuan City

240
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,367
- So you're class president? - Yeah

241
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:53,368
I'm Ma Xidao in charge

242
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:54,702
- The person in charge. - Yeah, yeah, yeah

243
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,412
The staff I work for

244
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,664
He didn't speak a word of English

245
00:10:58,374 --> 00:11:00,500
It's been a bit of a farce

246
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,712
ok

247
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:05,838
Do you want to eat before you go out

248
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,840
- Yeah, sure, sure. - Sure, sure

249
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:08,967
Well, you take your bag and your luggage

250
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,760
- Bao Bao. - But there's nothing to eat here

251
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,178
Here, here, here, here

252
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,888
Where is all that stuff

253
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,723
- There. - Ah

254
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:26,109
Is this only a thousand dollars a thousand

255
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:28,236
- Yeah. - Oh, my God

256
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:30,613
I don't know how I can travel without money

257
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:31,656
They all need a discount

258
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:34,158
Those guys over there are Korean gangsters

259
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,037
- Right? - Korean gangsters everywhere you go

260
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:40,832
There are a lot more Koreans doing business around here

261
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,916
The underworld has also increased

262
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,711
Violent crime also gives me a headache

263
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:48,214
What the fuck are you looking at

264
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:50,800
Underworld hello

265
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,261
- All the way to Vietnam. - Fuck you

266
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,721
- It's a cop. - Are you sure

267
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:56,180
- Cops. - Really? You sure

268
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:57,265
- Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Put it on

269
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,100
Hey, there's some weird stuff in there

270
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:00,268
And what looked like marijuana

271
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,644
Those guys are weird

272
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:02,854
What? Marijuana isn't.

273
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,440
- I'm on my way. - Oh, no

274
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,691
- Oh, you. - Not one of them

275
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,693
Can we take a break

276
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,737
- Look, they're leaving. Look, look. - Go, go, go

277
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,155
- Korean, right? - Yeah

278
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,656
- Hey, hey, hey. - We're having our opening

279
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:14,866
- The price is perfect right now. - What are you doing

280
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:17,035
- Service like Gangnam price like Ho Chi Minh - how so many Koreans

281
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,037
- All right, all right, kid. - Like Vietnam

282
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:19,954
Take away!

283
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:20,580
- Hey, hey. - Hey

284
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:23,041
Temasek,

285
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,584
You are the essential oil

286
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,295
The eldest brother

287
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:28,379
The kid

288
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:29,505
What the hell are you doing here

289
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,842
I have to think about life, too

290
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:33,718
Don't you get it

291
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:36,512
I can't spend my whole life in Korea like that

292
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,723
Whoa, whoa, then you shouldn't be doing this

293
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:40,558
I think I could do it in the morning

294
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,101
Our brother is very active in his work

295
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,269
This is who

296
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:45,104
I am cooking oil

297
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,398
What's cooking oil?

298
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,067
But I don't know what you're doing here

299
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,318
Are you here to arrest a prisoner

300
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:52,403
A vacation for a vacation

301
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,615
Be careful, brothers

302
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:56,783
Police in South Korea

303
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:57,784
It's not gonna work here

304
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,244
In the underworld here

305
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,371
There are a lot of guys who carry guns

306
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:03,372
- The gun? - Yeah

307
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:04,957
Some with guns and some with marchetti

308
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,667
A sword

309
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,294
The atmosphere here is totally different from Korea

310
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:08,795
right

311
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,799
It's none of our business. We're just here on vacation

312
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,550
- How could we get shot? - Yeah

313
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:16,594
- Then come and play. - Yeah

314
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:18,638
- Sure. - The service is like Gangnam

315
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,556
- Where are we going? Forget it. - Prices like Ho Chi Minh

316
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,937
The consulate is no different than our office

317
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,147
Oh, it's a bad environment

318
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:30,483
Anyway, at least we have air conditioning

319
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:32,109
Yeah, it's hot

320
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,611
- How could you do that? - You waited

321
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,071
ok

322
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:36,656
It's really hot

323
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:37,198
Yeah, it's hot

324
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:40,243
Looks like there's a lot of missing passengers around here

325
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,411
Yeah, over 30,000 visitors a month

326
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,621
There will be more cases

327
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:45,790
There are also many iron heart of their own play disappear

328
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,709
It's all about money

329
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,211
Just sign your name right here

330
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:51,337
You just take this file

331
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:52,547
Give it to immigration control

332
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,798
After 10:00 tomorrow morning

333
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,299
You can take the person away

334
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,176
But why so many files

335
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:00,888
- Because this case is also very rare. - What

336
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:03,975
The criminal came to the consulate to answer for it

337
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,184
There's no precedent

338
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,686
Vacate a room in a hurry

339
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:08,020
He was temporarily detained

340
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:10,606
But we also have many difficulties

341
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,110
But why did he turn himself in

342
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:17,405
He said it was his conscience

343
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,490
Feel what you feel

344
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,368
He said he had a bad conscience

345
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,578
Conscience is the task of

346
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,499
- Conscience. - What the hell

347
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,458
Ah this

348
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:32,003
Oh, shit, I made a mistake

349
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:32,962
The whole conscience

350
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:36,299
I'm sorry to trouble you

351
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:43,931
Zhong Xun!

352
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,225
Why did you turn yourself in

353
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,812
I'm really soul-searching

354
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,273
I'm going to Korea to be punished

355
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:54,775
You want to go to South Korea

356
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,199
You're eating a lot of food

357
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:02,742
It's

358
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,202
Monitor of the class

359
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,704
To the real room

360
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:09,248
Take this?

361
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,004
Well know

362
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:15,504
Give it to me

363
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:26,182
Well done

364
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:28,935
Well, you keep an eye on it

365
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:30,144
ok

366
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,397
Yeah, it's okay. It's okay.

367
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,568
Elder brother know

368
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,445
I don't know what you know

369
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,156
Why did you say you turned yourself in again

370
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,783
Because your conscience smitten you

371
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,701
- A guilty conscience? - Ah

372
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,248
Clock clock clock clock

373
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,041
Clock bell

374
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,377
Jondo tried to kill me

375
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,170
The clock is there

376
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:57,964
Is that Jong-du Lee with you

377
00:15:57,965 --> 00:15:59,423
- He's here, too, isn't he? - No

378
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:02,385
Isn't it

379
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:05,471
HSS

380
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:07,265
I know everything, don't I

381
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,268
Or we could take an ear off

382
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,270
Ear ear ear

383
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,771
Vice President

384
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,897
You go easy

385
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:16,816
There are a lot of ears. It wouldn't hurt to take one off

386
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,567
I need you to start talking

387
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:20,361
- Why would Lee kill you? - Pain pain

388
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,280
Pain pain

389
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,449
I touched a woman that Chung was seeing

390
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,576
Take the damn thing off his ear

391
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:30,496
Hey, if Lee Jong-du is here

392
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:31,956
That gold from the white is also in the choice

393
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,000
Didn't the three of you work together

394
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:34,750
- No. - Oh

395
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:37,003
HSS

396
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:38,629
No, no, no, no, no

397
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,715
Even if you don't say

398
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:42,508
I know everything, too

399
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,427
It's not what you're doing here

400
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:46,053
Is that the kuang one? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

401
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:48,055
Why are you doing this all of a sudden

402
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,850
Don't move. Don't move before you get hurt

403
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:53,227
If you move, you're dead

404
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,522
Save me

405
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:57,690


406
00:16:57,691 --> 00:17:00,401
Is it under construction

407
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:02,028
- My eardrums are bursting. - Don't do it

408
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,946
Pain, Don't play

409
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,448
Not that I really don't know

410
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,576
I don't know where to start

411
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,746
Ah, you don't know where it is, do you

412
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,331
That means you know where the clock is, right

413
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:19,754
I think we're just gonna go down there and arrest people

414
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:21,088
I don't think so

415
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,214
I was on my way to pick up a guy

416
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,258
You caught a couple of them so you can go back and get promoted

417
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,384
No, no, no.

418
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,511
We can't do this without jurisdiction

419
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:30,097
It's illegal for you to investigate or arrest here

420
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:31,223
Hello I said

421
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:32,516
I was just trying to convince him to turn himself in

422
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:33,642
What kind of investigation is that?

423
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,436
You go there and you investigate

424
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:36,771
Aren't you on a blind date

425
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:38,230
- That's research. - Get over here

426
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:39,899
- What are you talking about? - Yoo Jong-hoon

427
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,400
Did you say anything

428
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:43,361
I've been talking bullshit ever since

429
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,862
Monitor this file

430
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,364
I'll just hand it over to immigration

431
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,406
Ah well

432
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,367
Oh, I have a brother here that I know

433
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,910
- I have to go see him. - Okay

434
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:52,453
Do you know where this is, perhaps

435
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:54,872
It's not that far from us, is it

436
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,208
But it's kind of a rough neighborhood

437
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,502
That's not a problem

438
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,628
He is more dangerous

439
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:14,266
Is this

440
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:16,268
Hello, somebody, somebody.

441
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,897
Fuck locked

442
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,982
- Is it locked? Yes

443
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,780
!

444
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,408
opened

445
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,410
Hey, how did you break the lock

446
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:36,288
- Shit. - Jongdo Jonghoon already told us everything

447
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:38,958
South Korea

448
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,167
!

449
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:42,169
This is what

450
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,214
- why - fuck

451
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:49,051
Oh my god

452
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:51,303
What the fuck is going on here

453
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:54,348
This is a homicide

454
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,268
- Ugh. - Damn it

455
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,019
That's a big head

456
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,605
Call Consul Park

457
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,195
Hey, get up, boy

458
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,738
up

459
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,700
What are you lying about here, boy

460
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:14,034
What's the matter

461
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,203
Lee Jong-du was murdered

462
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:20,166
Tell me what you've been doing here

463
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:22,918
- You want to get beat up? - Sergeant

464
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,378
Not vice president that could be a problem

465
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:25,629
Squad leader, talk to him

466
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,506
I need you to talk some sense into him

467
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:29,717
Don't start work

468
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:31,677


469
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,762
Hey, why don't you stop looking like that

470
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,973
- LET me let you go. - What

471
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,683
- I think that's a good idea. - What

472
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:38,684
Hurry up to come over

473
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:40,352
- Come here. - It's not a police officer

474
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,687
I turned myself in

475
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,814
Surrender?

476
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,274
I will not accept surrender you get out

477
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:48,694
- Get out of here. - Didn't I fucking turn myself in

478
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,988
Arguing in front of who the fuck

479
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,323
Dare to swear in front of anyone

480
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:53,574
I'll walk you out

481
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:54,909
- Help me! - Get out of here

482
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,910
Save me

483
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,244
- Go home. - Wait, wait, wait

484
00:19:57,245 --> 00:19:58,329
- What is this about? - I was wrong

485
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,830
- What are you doing? - I'm wrong

486
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:00,206
Let him down

487
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:04,543
I am in Vietnam

488
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:07,046
Ran into a kid named Jiang Haishang and we kidnapped a guy

489
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:09,548
Who is Jiang Hai Shang

490
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:10,925
Jianghai is he

491
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:13,469
Encouraging us to kidnap Choi Yong-ki, who runs the resort

492
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,262
Because Choi yong-ki's family is rich

493
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:17,890
I'm too young to be polite

494
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:20,142
Spending money like water

495
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:20,726
Give me a

496
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:25,022
It's only $50,000

497
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,192
Fuck not even 90 million Korean dollars

498
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:29,860
If you got the

499
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,070
Less than 20 million won per person

500
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:33,113
What the hell is that talking about

501
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:34,323
hello

502
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:35,449
What's the matter

503
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,159
Don't tell me you went through all this trouble for a little money

504
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,036
Tell me about it

505
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,829
Clock degrees

506
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,581
I let them in because you said they were sophisticated

507
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,291
I didn't realize it was a bunch of rookies

508
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:45,459
- What? - You mean a novice

509
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:47,419
Is it too innocent

510
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,588
What the fuck

511
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,550
What the fuck

512
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,717
Mama of

513
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:56,762
What are you talking about hello

514
00:20:56,763 --> 00:20:58,597
If it wasn't for boss Choi's money

515
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,723
I would have killed it for you

516
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,477
Oh, look at you for getting fucked

517
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,437
Son of a bitch

518
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,232
Don't you want to make money

519
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:10,442
Enough is enough

520
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,319
You talk a little bit

521
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,487
- What the fuck. - Hey, hey

522
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:14,738
- Hey, hey, hey. - Let go

523
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:16,156
Enough is enough

524
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,159
- What the fuck is this guy? - Put him in fucking custody

525
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,288
Stop! Stop! Stop

526
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:24,582
I'll come back to it later

527
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,626
Get that son of a bitch

528
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,053
You stop the fuck right there

529
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:40,889
You fucking

530
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,225
We can't let him get away

531
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:44,893
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

532
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:48,480
Fuck what?

533
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,316
Get the fuck out of him

534
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:52,818
Hey, stand over there fucking right now

535
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,778
I have no choice but to come here

536
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,616
Get the fuck over here.

537
00:22:02,203 --> 00:22:03,954
I have no choice but to come here

538
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:07,207
- Get the fuck over here. - You son of a bitch

539
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,293
Fuck your mother

540
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,086
Do you want to die

541
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:12,713
Hold on, hold on, hold on

542
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:14,798
I'll I'll give you 100 million each

543
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,550
- I'll give you $100 million each. - Fuck

544
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,011
- Fuck. - $100 million each

545
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:21,305
- Are you serious? - In my hotel room

546
00:22:21,348 --> 00:22:23,098
It's over 200 million and a little bit of gold

547
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,391
Just cut me some slack, please

548
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,935
So what the fuck is the code

549
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:28,729
2963

550
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,813
2963?

551
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:31,482
2963 that's right!

552
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,108
So I said

553
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,360
If you'd given me the money when I asked for it

554
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:36,654
- Isn't that all? - I'm sorry

555
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,447
I wish you had told me

556
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,865
It's a fucking effort.

557
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,035
Why don't we make a resort until the kid gets here

558
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:44,662
Your fucking mouth

559
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,498
You fucking lie one more time and you're dead

560
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,708
Mama of

561
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,931
Dead?

562
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,811
You must be a fucking lunatic

563
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,104
Are you crazy

564
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,230
What if you kill someone

565
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,481
You have no choice

566
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,483
Don't kill the money before you get it

567
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:15,693
You son of a bitch

568
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,487
Fucking money...

569
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,531
What's going on? Fuck.

570
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:31,583
It's good to lose personal money

571
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,680
What the fuck is this all about

572
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,348
You're not gonna do your job right

573
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:47,766
Hurry up, boy

574
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:58,777
It's really convenient to work abroad

575
00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:00,821
The police don't mind their own business

576
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:02,364
Convenient operation

577
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:03,991
From the hotel safe

578
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:07,161
200 million and a little nugget

579
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,456
That's it?

580
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:12,666
I think we can get some more

581
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,960
again

582
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,754
Hello to you

583
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:20,466
First, don't move

584
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:16,104
Then it takes about two days for the money to arrive

585
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:17,856
The clock and I just ran away

586
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:20,818
That kid's eyes changed when the money came in

587
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,194
And then not long ago

588
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:24,321
Strange people started poking around me

589
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,740
This guy is Jiang Haishang

590
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:29,243
Sent his men here to kill me, too

591
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,329
I'm sorry

592
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:35,332
All the more reason you should have said something sooner

593
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,376
Is that why you turned yourself in

594
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:39,127
right

595
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:40,295
He clock degrees

596
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:41,880
Jiang Hai Shang must have killed him, too

597
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,258
He'd kill me if he knew I was here

598
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:45,467
please

599
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,095
Take me back to Korea, brother

600
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,305
What are we gonna do about this

601
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,267
Look for the bodies

602
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,227
You're happy, aren't you? Damn it

603
00:25:55,228 --> 00:25:56,645
You write down the address here

604
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:58,730
- The address? - Yeah

605
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,482
The vice monitor

606
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:01,859
And then things get very complicated

607
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,402
I didn't say anything like that

608
00:26:03,403 --> 00:26:05,612
We need to at least get this address

609
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:07,364
Ok ok

610
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,241
Monitor of the class

611
00:26:09,242 --> 00:26:10,659
This really needs to be handled by the police

612
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,287
Or you will be forcibly sent home

613
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:14,538
Then please

614
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,457
- What? - Will you just forcibly repatriate him, please

615
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,458
Forget it

616
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,502
Sergeant, can I do this for you

617
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,174
Alas! The eldest brother

618
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,260
Interesting?

619
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:30,053
Look up the name Jiang Hae-shang

620
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:32,055
Let's see if we have a record

621
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:35,767
Then check if there have been any reports of choi yong-ki's disappearance recently

622
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:37,811
Kang Hae-sang and Choi Yong-ki

623
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:40,188
Any other details

624
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,398
Didn't the

625
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:43,817
Hung up the

626
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,027
Good good

627
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:46,570
Thank you

628
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,989
So did you say anything

629
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,576
It's the same cops who don't understand cops

630
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,912
It's gonna be a month before we get a warrant

631
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,538
When the time comes jiang Hai is still that boy

632
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:58,123
He's gone to another country

633
00:26:58,124 --> 00:26:59,958
Well, it's not Korea

634
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:00,918
That's right Yesterday the whole

635
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,420
Is there anything we can do about him

636
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,089
- I said no. - No, I can't

637
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,258
- Shit. - Where are you going

638
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:09,301
Vice President

639
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:11,303
Squad leader deputy squad leader where are we going

640
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:13,055
I need you to talk to him

641
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,806
Let's go talk to him

642
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,225
He must have listened even less

643
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:19,394
Have you seen this man

644
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,979
I don't know what you're talking about

645
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:25,609
Hello tin road,

646
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,778
I know I can't stop you

647
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,404
But this is not Garibong Dong

648
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:33,659
Wait etc.

649
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,744
- Oh, you are. - Wait a minute

650
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:37,287
What are you doing here, Officer Ma

651
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:38,914
I just want to take this kid down

652
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,041
Get out of my way

653
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:42,751
Wait a minute

654
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:43,752
The police officer

655
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:45,087
You really can't

656
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:47,172
Will you be responsible if anything goes wrong here

657
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:48,465
That's illegal

658
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:50,467
I'm not saying if the laws of this country

659
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:51,760
Can't protect the people of our country

660
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,470
Well, at least we can protect them, right

661
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:54,888
You're right

662
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:55,681
Isn't it

663
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,269
Mama of

664
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,315
Call the police the police

665
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,359
Then we'll all be taken away

666
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:18,078
But are you sure there's something to it

667
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:20,664
Are you farming

668
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,583
Dig for me seriously faster faster

669
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:28,296
- It's an earthworm. - Shit

670
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:32,634
What thing

671
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,647
Hey, I got it. I got it

672
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,025
I fuck

673
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,861
There's also here

674
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:51,737
It would have been

675
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:55,782
What a mess

676
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:57,701
I'll contact the police

677
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,051
There were four bodies

678
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,429
I'm really here on vacation

679
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,973
- What's up, man? - Hello

680
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:22,100
Have you heard of jiang Haishang

681
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,437
Why are you going after this kid, too

682
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:27,105
How do you know him

683
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:29,066
There's a Korean underworld

684
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:31,443
It's quite famous around here as a ra-nine

685
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:33,695
It's been around since about three days ago

686
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:35,697
Jianghai still find

687
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:37,365
- Pull nine? - Yeah

688
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,366
Where is the boy now

689
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,243
I don't know about that

690
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:41,328
Is there something wrong with you

691
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,246
Text me when you find out

692
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:44,414
The eldest brother eldest brother

693
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,425
- What hotel? - What? What

694
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:56,885
No no no hotel

695
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,096
- We are. - I'm calling you

696
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,097
Mom let go

697
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,598
- We're cops, too. - Squad leader

698
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,225
So many people have died in our country

699
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:04,726
- How could I do nothing? - Squad leader

700
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,645
How do we not have the right to investigate

701
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:08,980
I pulled a gun gun gun gun

702
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,315
That's also the case

703
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:11,691
So let me do it here

704
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:12,901
- Why don't you go back to the hotel? - Okay, okay

705
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,736
Ok, I know. Sorry, sorry

706
00:30:14,737 --> 00:30:16,196
- Got it. - OK, I know

707
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:18,073
This kid has to be caught

708
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,992
Just bring it to the Korean consulate

709
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:22,744
I think I can get a plane back to Korea

710
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:24,579
How are you gonna catch it

711
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:25,872
Any plans

712
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:29,918
Come with me

713
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:44,516
Wow, it's really hot

714
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,064
Are you there yet?

715
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:52,691
- Where? - Here, here, here

716
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:54,150
The boss

717
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:55,652
Let's go

718
00:30:57,446 --> 00:30:59,948
I want half a million dollars in cash

719
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:03,910
- You checked with your own eyes, right? - There are a lot of tourist bags

720
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:05,662
Sure that's right

721
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,289
I confirmed it myself

722
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,791
I also saw Jiang Haishang went out this morning

723
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:15,922
Did go

724
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,757
good

725
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,218
thank you

726
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,138
Wow, so many

727
00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:26,183
Look at this guy

728
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,144
At least a billion dollars

729
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,520
How many people did you kill? This is

730
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,355
Let's get the money out of here

731
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,190
ok

732
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,193


733
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,320
To find the

734
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,244
How did you get here

735
00:31:46,245 --> 00:31:47,704
I came by bus

736
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:51,291
Do you think it

737
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:53,960
All of them are Korean

738
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:58,048
feed

739
00:31:58,507 --> 00:31:59,966
You come over

740
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,092
To come over

741
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:03,720
- What? - What

742
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,848
Pull the nine nine call what he is to me

743
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:08,433
Who are you

744
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:10,769
All of these are Korean gangsters

745
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:12,646
Hey, everybody get over here

746
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,023
Are you the police

747
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:17,359
Get out of here and stop looking for trouble

748
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:18,401
Is there

749
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:19,653
Where to go

750
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,539
Just lie down. Lie down

751
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,624
Could get hurt

752
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:34,626
Just lie down

753
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:49,015
- Hey. - Lie down

754
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,809
The Korean police came to someone else's place of business

755
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:52,560
What the hell is wrong with you sons of bitches

756
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,521
Are you the police

757
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:55,981
You must be Ra-koo

758
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,608
Yeah, I'm a fucking asshole

759
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:03,822
You are what

760
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,991
- I'm the little one. - That's really bad

761
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:13,164
You are all dead

762
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:14,624
This is Vietnam

763
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,710
This is not Korea

764
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,545
fuck

765
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:21,965
That's a real gun the kid's got

766
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,508
So, this kid's gonna kill somebody

767
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,509
Come here, come here, come here

768
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,303
I'll shoot you in the head

769
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,804
- Don't fuck me. - Spare my life

770
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,014
Stay the fuck away from me

771
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:29,764
Don't move don't move

772
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:31,850
All don't move

773
00:33:31,892 --> 00:33:34,894
Don't move or I'll shoot you

774
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:38,314
Don't move, either of you

775
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,317
If you don't tell the truth from now on

776
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,193
- All right? - All right

777
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:43,820
Make it clear to me

778
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,697
Why do you want Jiang Haishang

779
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:46,740
We did take the money

780
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:48,783
We were given the address details and I don't know

781
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,618
So I said who

782
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:52,370
All I know is it's from Korea

783
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:55,123
I know nothing but professional killers

784
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,041
Killer?

785
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:58,043
right

786
00:33:58,044 --> 00:33:59,711
So we found Jiang Haishang

787
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,631
That little strip over there

788
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:05,508
hello

789
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:06,801
Who are you

790
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,846
- I owe you. - Don't owe you. Get over here

791
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:13,725
- I'll be right back. - Hard work

792
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:18,104
Brother, where are you?

793
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:20,440
We just got Kang Hae-sang's location and we're heading there

794
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,858
Did you learn anything

795
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:24,235
Jiang Haizang requested a friend of the department of information

796
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,487
A survey of

797
00:34:25,488 --> 00:34:27,614
There is something strange about Choi's remarks

798
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:30,366
- He wasn't reported missing. - Really

799
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:33,370
What about his parents and the rest of his family

800
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,746
What does his father do

801
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:36,539
The name is Cui Chunbai

802
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,583
The owner of JOEUNCAPITAL, a private loan firm

803
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,169
Where does Cui Chunbai seem to have heard of this name

804
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,837
HSS this person

805
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,547
He was the head of the myeongdong loan market

806
00:34:44,548 --> 00:34:47,258
The name of the loan company is actually lending money to corporations

807
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:49,928
A day's worth of cash

808
00:34:50,012 --> 00:34:51,554
More than many chaebol

809
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:54,557
But the son went missing and never reported it

810
00:34:54,558 --> 00:34:55,767
I'm not gonna dig into him again

811
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:57,477
Okay, look into it and I'll call you back

812
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,728
good

813
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:01,314
How's that

814
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:03,483
He must have been Choi yong-ki's father

815
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:06,069
Send someone to kill the man who kidnapped his son

816
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,986
what

817
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,842
Here we go

818
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:09,692
Yo, look at this guy

819
00:38:45,914 --> 00:38:46,623
Give me death

820
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:57,925
Are you from Korea

821
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:29,791
Did you take my money

822
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:41,219
Who sent you

823
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,598
Fucking roll

824
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,773
Cui Chunbai

825
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:57,360
Cui Chunbai cui Chunbai

826
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,319
Yong-ki's father, right

827
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:16,754
Yonki's father

828
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:19,465
I am Jiang Haishang

829
00:40:19,925 --> 00:40:22,176
You're not dead yet

830
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:24,846
Did you send someone to kill me

831
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:27,390
You take money and you kill people

832
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,101
You think you're gonna be fine

833
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:32,729
I told him to go home

834
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:35,732
But I didn't say anything about bringing him home alive

835
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:40,945
I'm gonna kill you for sure

836
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:47,452
Why did you take my money

837
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:49,954
what

838
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:51,289
Give it back to me

839
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,624
Otherwise I would have gone back to Korea

840
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,136
This helpless courtesy was eaten by the dog

841
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:19,567
Hey, wait, wait, wait

842
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,111
- All right. - What are you doing with that gun

843
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:25,114
I just forgot to give it back

844
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,532
Under such an inferior

845
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,287
The door was open

846
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:32,955
Mama of

847
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:35,208
You must have run away on the scent

848
00:41:39,505 --> 00:41:43,966
What the fuck is that

849
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,594
That's a couple of dead people

850
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,013
I think we're a little late

851
00:41:49,932 --> 00:41:51,599
Mama of

852
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:03,027
But why are there so many travel bags

853
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,238
Young dog

854
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,532
Pick on one of our own

855
00:42:08,951 --> 00:42:10,535
Look at these passports.

856
00:42:10,953 --> 00:42:11,661
This is what

857
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,456
We found Choi Yong-ki

858
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,208
Mama of

859
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:32,014
Get the fuck over here

860
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:52,952
You son of a bitch

861
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,454
Are you Jiang Haishang

862
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:04,046
Is the police

863
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:06,799
Don't move

864
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:09,760
Put the knife down

865
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:12,179
Put the knife down

866
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:10,863
Monitor of the class

867
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:16,494
What the fuck

868
00:44:16,495 --> 00:44:19,205
This thing is not called a gun shit

869
00:44:23,085 --> 00:44:24,335
I have no idea

870
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:27,421
No, that's not a bad thing to say

871
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:30,174
How is this for our own people

872
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:31,425
The things that come up

873
00:44:31,426 --> 00:44:33,427
If that's what we're gonna do

874
00:44:33,428 --> 00:44:36,097
Of course I know there's an order to everything

875
00:44:36,098 --> 00:44:37,848
Hello tin road,

876
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,225
We got to catch that son of a bitch

877
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:40,643
I was so angry

878
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,478
You know I'm gonna catch that kid

879
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,314
- You need to calm down. - How do I calm down

880
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:46,899
I can't even pee alone right now

881
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:49,151
Damn it, call me if you need to pee

882
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,780
Oh, come back

883
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:54,031
We're stuck here

884
00:44:54,032 --> 00:44:56,367
How long are you staying

885
00:44:56,368 --> 00:44:58,202
-Uh-huh. Hong Seok

886
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,870
Big brother, are you okay

887
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,205
How about the monitor and others

888
00:45:01,206 --> 00:45:02,957
Sergeant, he's fine.

889
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Jianghai yet?

890
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,168
Intelligence has been gathering information about what's going on in Southeast Asia

891
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:09,296
Documents on the kidnapping and murder of Korean tourists

892
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:11,215
Philippines Cambodia

893
00:45:11,216 --> 00:45:13,926
However, the four cases are the same as Jiang Hae-sang's crime methods

894
00:45:14,136 --> 00:45:15,553
After getting close, I got familiar

895
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:17,722
Threatening money for kidnapping

896
00:45:17,723 --> 00:45:20,224
But no one came back alive after the transfer

897
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:21,517
How many people in all

898
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,019
So far we've got four

899
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,146
Oh, the eldest brother

900
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,857
Director he also said

901
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,275
I want you to stop getting in trouble and get back here

902
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:30,901
I got it. Let's go

903
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:32,570
How are you, Monitor

904
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:34,071
- Is everything okay? - Ouch

905
00:45:34,072 --> 00:45:34,864
Ok ok

906
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:36,073
It's just an exaggerated cry of pain

907
00:45:36,658 --> 00:45:39,160
So didn't I tell you to go back to the hotel

908
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:41,120
Is really of alas

909
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:43,247
You two

910
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:44,415
They've all been deported

911
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:47,668
- What? - When the person in charge comes

912
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:49,170
You need to get to the airport now

913
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:50,254
- Wait a minute. - Wait a minute

914
00:45:50,255 --> 00:45:51,297
I need you to behave yourself

915
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:53,758
That boy Hae-sang Jiang I'm gonna catch him here

916
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:55,051
The police officer

917
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,302
Not the eldest brother

918
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:58,429
I said you were so obsessed with catching people out of town

919
00:45:58,638 --> 00:46:01,057
What is the reason

920
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:04,435
What reason is there to arrest a murderer

921
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:07,188
Bad guys are what you catch

922
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,230
To grasp

923
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:10,274
I'm not leaving until I have that kid

924
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:11,859
I don't go

925
00:46:12,194 --> 00:46:13,778
- I'm sorry. - I really can't leave

926
00:46:13,779 --> 00:46:15,071
- Shit. - I'm really pissed off

927
00:46:16,156 --> 00:46:17,865
- I'm not leaving. - Right

928
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,077
I just brought in the tall guy

929
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:28,751
what

930
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:53,818
You have no choice

931
00:46:54,736 --> 00:46:55,778
hello

932
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,863
Jiang Haishang where is he

933
00:46:59,366 --> 00:47:01,700
Eight dead people and you're gonna take them all on yourself

934
00:47:03,662 --> 00:47:06,497
You'll be killed by the police here anyway

935
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,041
hello

936
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,503
If you tell me where Jiang Haishang is

937
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:16,173
I'll be in charge of requesting your return

938
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,052
immediately

939
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:21,929
You will be deported from Vietnam

940
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:26,934
I can't walk

941
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,561
- I'm not leaving. - Wait

942
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:30,271
Wait, stop, stop, stop

943
00:47:30,272 --> 00:47:31,355
- Tin lane. - Move, move, move, move

944
00:47:31,356 --> 00:47:33,399
Don't do this. Don't do this

945
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,692
To come to

946
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:36,402
- Come on, let's go. - Let's go

947
00:47:36,444 --> 00:47:37,570
- Let's go. - Let's go

948
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:38,863
- Korea. - Korea for what

949
00:47:38,905 --> 00:47:39,864
We were evicted, weren't we

950
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:41,282
We should be evicted

951
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:43,534
- We're being evicted? - Of course we're obeying the law

952
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:44,702
Help me out

953
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,291
We Korea Korea go fast

954
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:52,668
OK, let's go, let's go

955
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:54,587
- We have to go. - Are you crazy

956
00:47:54,588 --> 00:47:56,046
Hey, aren't we here to catch Jiang Hai Shang

957
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:58,632
Jiang Haishang he went to Korea to see Cui Chunbai

958
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:01,176
- Come on. - Go, go, go

959
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:07,099
Oh, man, this maniac is laughing his ass off

960
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,934
- Oh, man. - Yeah

961
00:48:08,935 --> 00:48:10,853
Hey whistle our monitor how to do this

962
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,104
Don't say

963
00:48:12,105 --> 00:48:15,524
About a dozen guys came over with big knives like this

964
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,193
- If it wasn't for me. - You go home and rest

965
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,361
Back from the

966
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:21,989
I need to go back and talk to the authorities

967
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,908
- Because I'm the monitor. - Give him his luggage

968
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:25,326
- All right. - Let's get out of here, too

969
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:27,244
What the hell are you doing

970
00:48:27,245 --> 00:48:29,330
I need you to help me carry it

971
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:31,373
This hand of mine is like this

972
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:33,417
Flying is so tiring

973
00:48:33,418 --> 00:48:35,294
Ouch what to do

974
00:48:35,295 --> 00:48:37,296


975
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:40,382
We're circling the west Sea crossing to see if there's any boats sneaking in

976
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:41,383
But the eldest brother

977
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:42,551
You're sure he's back in town

978
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,011
For sure

979
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:47,223
By the way, your squad leader almost died

980
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:50,768
The thought of that wicked criminal makes my blood boil

981
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,729
He attacked a police officer

982
00:48:54,356 --> 00:48:56,732
Just let me see it again

983
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,415
Where are you going

984
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,960
- I'm going to the third floor. - Let's go

985
00:49:16,044 --> 00:49:17,586
There must be no mistake about it this time

986
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:18,796
- The rest of the money - Jajangmyon takeout

987
00:49:18,797 --> 00:49:21,257
I didn't send the guy who ran away at the airport

988
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,676
- Where do you want it? - Just put it there

989
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:27,137
The boss

990
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:36,438
Would you please slowly

991
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:41,777
I'm gonna tear this place apart for you

992
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,030
- You eat it. - Fuck

993
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:47,700
- And I ordered sweet and sour pork. - Then I'm out of my way

994
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:49,159
Order these for one person

995
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,580
How did you know I was here

996
00:49:53,581 --> 00:49:55,207
Do you know navigation

997
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,333
Enter the navigation and it all comes out

998
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:58,627
hello

999
00:49:59,337 --> 00:50:00,296
Sit down

1000
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,630
Illegal aliens sit down

1001
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:03,799
I've been legal for a long time

1002
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:06,010
Ever since I came back from the knife

1003
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:08,178
I'll just do what's legal

1004
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:10,723
Is it legal to take money from smugglers and put them to work

1005
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:11,807
- Kick your ass. - Hey, hey

1006
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,684
I don't have time right now

1007
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:16,562
I need you to tell me the boat route from China to South Korea

1008
00:50:16,563 --> 00:50:19,648
I told you I haven't done it in a while

1009
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:23,485
What are you doing? That's rude

1010
00:50:23,903 --> 00:50:25,237
You can't do that

1011
00:50:25,238 --> 00:50:27,448
Long time no see

1012
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:29,450
to

1013
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:32,328
-you didn't hear me

1014
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:34,955
I'm not the jang I-soo I used to be

1015
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,626
now

1016
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:41,837
I'm not gonna let you do this to me

1017
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:48,886
HSS

1018
00:50:57,645 --> 00:50:58,687
So said

1019
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:01,357
Did any ships come in yesterday or today

1020
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,276
Know the

1021
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:05,527
Hung up the

1022
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:07,363
Who?

1023
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,240
Nicknamed Captain One-eyed

1024
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,785
He runs all the smuggling boats from China

1025
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:15,162
There was a strange ship

1026
00:51:15,163 --> 00:51:17,247
Arrived at Gongping Port early this morning

1027
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:19,458
- Hey, call Hong Seok. - Okay

1028
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,711
Hello, Hong Seok, where are you now

1029
00:51:22,754 --> 00:51:24,588
Ah, not where you put the surveillance near Gongping Port

1030
00:51:24,589 --> 00:51:26,256
Bring it all in

1031
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:28,467
- Yeah, wait. - There's more

1032
00:51:30,178 --> 00:51:31,386
There are

1033
00:51:31,846 --> 00:51:33,889
- No more. - Yeah, that's all

1034
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:35,682
I'm not saying you popped in

1035
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:37,684
- Bullying again. - Cut the crap

1036
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:39,770
I call you and I get it

1037
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:41,397
- Let's go. - Okay

1038
00:51:42,857 --> 00:51:45,651
What a fucking dog I am

1039
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,239
- Did you call me? - No

1040
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:51,406


1041
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:56,787
Oh, god damn it. Oh, god damn it

1042
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,997


1043
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,377
Where is this?

1044
00:52:03,378 --> 00:52:05,754
This is the parking lot behind Gongping Port

1045
00:52:05,797 --> 00:52:07,756
There's nothing there

1046
00:52:08,216 --> 00:52:10,509
Look at the next

1047
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,177
!

1048
00:52:13,054 --> 00:52:14,096
The eldest brother

1049
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:15,222
What's the matter

1050
00:52:16,558 --> 00:52:16,974
There's something weird about this guy

1051
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:20,018
He's blowing a tire

1052
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:21,395
Is that a car key

1053
00:52:21,855 --> 00:52:24,231
- Uh, I think I found it. - Did you find it

1054
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,191
Play back the

1055
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:28,235
Take a look at

1056
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,112
suspended

1057
00:52:30,572 --> 00:52:31,446
amplification

1058
00:52:32,657 --> 00:52:33,991
Wu, 26, 8251

1059
00:52:33,992 --> 00:52:35,617
Yeah, that's the guy

1060
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,660
Wanted on this car

1061
00:52:36,661 --> 00:52:38,287
This guy finally got you

1062
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,173
President of

1063
00:52:49,174 --> 00:52:51,592
I think Kang Hae-sang came to Korea

1064
00:52:51,926 --> 00:52:54,052
Reconnect with the killers

1065
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:56,054
Bring it from the outside

1066
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:58,265
The first two

1067
00:52:58,266 --> 00:53:00,475
Two more when you bring the guy in front of me

1068
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:01,518
yes

1069
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:03,312
Bring it to me, alive or dead

1070
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:04,897
Okay, got it.

1071
00:53:29,464 --> 00:53:30,589
We'll release the explanation to the press

1072
00:53:31,216 --> 00:53:33,342
Get out of here

1073
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:38,138
hello Temasek,

1074
00:53:38,473 --> 00:53:39,473
I told you to go back in peace

1075
00:53:39,474 --> 00:53:41,517
You're spreading the word all over the place

1076
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,935
Are you trying to make things worse

1077
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:43,977
To bore me to death

1078
00:53:44,312 --> 00:53:45,646
What's the big deal

1079
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:47,022
I'm trying to catch a prisoner

1080
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,150
So why are you arresting people there

1081
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:52,194
They have their own police there, too

1082
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,320
And you

1083
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,948
You said you'd supervise him and I got you out of here

1084
00:53:55,949 --> 00:53:57,324
And you two got me in trouble together

1085
00:53:57,325 --> 00:53:58,367
Also shot

1086
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:01,203
Ah, the gun didn't work so well that I didn't fire it too many times

1087
00:54:02,163 --> 00:54:02,829
Ah, but the chief's handing it over to external affairs

1088
00:54:03,957 --> 00:54:05,374
What does that mean?

1089
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:07,376
It's not that we managed to gather surveillance data

1090
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:10,128
How can you hand over the case to them now that we're close to solving it

1091
00:54:12,507 --> 00:54:14,299
You tell me there's nothing I can do

1092
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:17,094
- Shit. - Why can't you always do that

1093
00:54:17,095 --> 00:54:18,345
It's really strange

1094
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,889
ah

1095
00:54:21,015 --> 00:54:22,808
Oh, our chief is not again

1096
00:54:23,184 --> 00:54:25,769
You didn't read your report carefully, did you

1097
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:26,770
- Oh, you didn't read it? - Yeah

1098
00:54:26,771 --> 00:54:28,355
I don't work

1099
00:54:28,356 --> 00:54:29,898
What do you mean

1100
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:31,525
oh

1101
00:54:31,818 --> 00:54:34,987
There are now four bodies recovered in Vietnam

1102
00:54:35,196 --> 00:54:37,239
In the Philippines and Cambodia

1103
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,491
In the case of the kidnapping of Koreans

1104
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:42,119
The suspect is Kang Hae-sang four more cases

1105
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,413
This guy is a nut job

1106
00:54:44,455 --> 00:54:46,707
So I forwarded it to foreign Affairs

1107
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:49,751
If these are the only ones that should be handed over to foreign Affairs

1108
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:50,836
Anything else?

1109
00:54:51,296 --> 00:54:53,255
The father of Choi Yong-ki, who is now dead

1110
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,756
Because he killed his own son

1111
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:56,508
He hired thugs in Korea

1112
00:54:56,509 --> 00:54:58,927
Tell them to kill Jiang Haishang and his crew

1113
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:01,597
But Jiang Haizang killed all those thugs

1114
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:03,682
Now I'm looking for Cui Chunbai

1115
00:55:03,725 --> 00:55:05,434
At this time if Jianghai still appear

1116
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:07,436
Cui Chunbai will he endure

1117
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,605
- Isn't that a headache? - That's a headache

1118
00:55:09,897 --> 00:55:12,065
Cui Chunbai hired thugs to look for them everywhere

1119
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,067
Then Seoul is a sea of blood

1120
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,902
Then we'll all be on TV

1121
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:17,112
On TV

1122
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,739
- Then we're all screwed. - We're all screwed

1123
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,782
- Especially brother. You're the worst. - Worst

1124
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:22,534
- Because you're in charge. - Because you're in charge

1125
00:55:22,994 --> 00:55:24,578
Did you write that in the report

1126
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:25,829
Is it gonna get this big

1127
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,706
So please

1128
00:55:27,749 --> 00:55:29,958
Just read the report, please, please, please

1129
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,544
I told you to read it carefully

1130
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:35,380
I can only block it for a week

1131
00:55:35,757 --> 00:55:37,174
You have a week to solve this case

1132
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:38,216
A week

1133
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:39,343
- Got it. - Ah

1134
00:55:39,344 --> 00:55:40,927
- A week. - A week

1135
00:55:40,928 --> 00:55:43,472
- My mother a week. - Oh, my god

1136
00:55:45,058 --> 00:55:46,933
alas

1137
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:06,119
I brought my yonky home

1138
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,455
You must be the detective

1139
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,249
is

1140
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:17,089
Thank you

1141
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:20,258
Please make sure you have a meal before you go

1142
00:56:21,427 --> 00:56:22,594
good

1143
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:28,975
To remarry.

1144
00:56:28,976 --> 00:56:32,104
No children with his dead first wife

1145
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:34,731
That Choi Yong-ki is the only blood

1146
00:56:35,983 --> 00:56:37,275
Understand why you hired a goon

1147
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:39,194
Ah really

1148
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,113
Oh, what a bunch of bastards

1149
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:42,364
Gather a lot of

1150
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,490
yeah

1151
00:56:45,076 --> 00:56:46,827
Ah, what a lovely day!

1152
00:56:46,828 --> 00:56:49,079
Can't we reimburse you for the gas

1153
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,664
You don't think that's possible

1154
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:52,666
Mama of

1155
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:55,127
Hey, you bought this in installments

1156
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:56,503
- 60 months - days

1157
00:56:56,504 --> 00:56:58,171
There are 59 months left

1158
00:56:58,172 --> 00:57:00,048
You take care of it not to solve a crime

1159
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,050
Sacrifice it, you know

1160
00:57:02,093 --> 00:57:03,719
You know how much I love this car

1161
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,512
- It's not a used car. - Yeah, Dong-gyun

1162
00:57:05,513 --> 00:57:07,764
Well know

1163
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,184

00:57:11,185 --> 00:57:12,894
East are found jiang Haishan in the car

1165
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:14,688
- I'm going over there. - Let's go. I'll drive

1166
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:16,106
The forehead is not you

1167
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:17,607
Keep a good eye on Cui Chunbai here

1168
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,693
You stay here and check the surveillance, okay

1169
00:57:19,694 --> 00:57:21,737
- Okay. - Hey, give him your car keys

1170
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,946
- My car keys? - Give me yours

1171
00:57:22,947 --> 00:57:25,031
I'm much more comfortable with this USB

1172
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:27,284
This is called the SUV

1173
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,543
alas

1174
00:57:36,544 --> 00:57:37,711
I can't convince you

1175
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:47,387
Oh brother

1176
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,680
Hey, did you find anything

1177
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,265
Ah Jiang Hai shang this guy can be really careful

1178
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,559
I cleaned it up before I threw it away

1179
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,978
- Shit. - Didn't find anything

1180
00:57:54,979 --> 00:57:56,730
And there's no surveillance around here

1181
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,940
Things are getting a little tricky

1182
00:58:19,378 --> 00:58:21,588
He waited in the underground parking lot

1183
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:24,466
It's president Zhu's side of the Chinese triad

1184
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,301
They can be trusted

1185
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,762
If I fail this time I'll kill you first

1186
00:58:28,763 --> 00:58:30,096
is

1187
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:34,100
The president is going downstairs. Get ready

1188
00:58:44,028 --> 00:58:45,612
Yeah, I'm coming down.

1189
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,949
Know the

1190
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:53,286
Let's go

1191
00:58:58,209 --> 00:58:59,501
, etc.

1192
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,546
What's wrong with these guys

1193
00:59:15,017 --> 00:59:17,435
Tut doesn't look like anything

1194
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:23,692


1195
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,070
I am Jiang Haishang

1196
00:59:27,572 --> 00:59:28,572
You this guy

1197
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,207
You this bastard

1198
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:42,168
ahhh

1199
00:59:51,262 --> 00:59:54,556
Give me to death

1200
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,826
I said I would come to Korea

1201
01:00:15,328 --> 01:00:17,412
Where's my money

1202
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,497
Say hello to the president

1203
01:00:19,498 --> 01:00:22,375
All we have to do is kill someone named Jiang Hae-sang

1204
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,968
ah

1205
01:00:35,222 --> 01:00:36,598
Who the fuck is this

1206
01:00:56,869 --> 01:00:58,411
You got to get over here

1207
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:20,975
Long time no see

1208
01:01:21,769 --> 01:01:23,520
What the hell is wrong with the Chinese

1209
01:01:24,772 --> 01:01:26,523
You're gonna have to give me a little more money

1210
01:01:33,364 --> 01:01:34,322
!

1211
01:01:34,782 --> 01:01:35,949
What circumstance

1212
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:37,617
Mama of

1213
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:40,620
Hong Xige is on the first floor underground

1214
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:43,665
Cui Chunbai was kidnapped

1215
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:48,420
And so on mother's

1216
01:01:56,303 --> 01:01:58,680
First floor underground Equus Equus

1217
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:02,308
Fucking stop! Stop! Stop! Stop

1218
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:07,814
Mama of

1219
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,525
Feed stopped

1220
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:14,112
Mama of

1221
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:17,866
Big brother, are you okay

1222
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,242
Hey, did you see the license plate

1223
01:02:19,243 --> 01:02:20,326
Look at the

1224
01:02:23,622 --> 01:02:25,123
Is the camera on

1225
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,332
Open the camera

1226
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:28,042
Can see!

1227
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:32,255
This is where you're gonna lose your head tomorrow

1228
01:02:32,256 --> 01:02:34,507
This is it

1229
01:02:37,428 --> 01:02:38,928
$2 billion by tomorrow

1230
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,347
Keep your phone on

1231
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:46,936
this

1232
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:49,022
When did you receive it

1233
01:02:50,524 --> 01:02:53,359
I picked it up at home last night

1234
01:02:57,698 --> 01:02:59,282
- Go ahead and play it. - Okay

1235
01:03:01,827 --> 01:03:03,995
- These two are brothers, aren't they? - Yes

1236
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,915
Special robber of commission killing

1237
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:09,417
Oh, these guys

1238
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,252
These guys are never gonna make it back

1239
01:03:11,879 --> 01:03:15,131
These guys fled to the Philippines after they were wanted in Korea

1240
01:03:15,132 --> 01:03:18,051
Interpol is also looking for them for murder cases involving Koreans

1241
01:03:18,177 --> 01:03:19,469
But investigate the movement

1242
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:23,348
They had the same travel schedule as Kang hae-sang in the Philippines for about six months

1243
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,683
This looks like an abandoned factory

1244
01:03:25,726 --> 01:03:28,645
Were there any abandoned factories near where we found the car

1245
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:32,524
We don't have any extra backup right now

1246
01:03:32,566 --> 01:03:33,608
You used to

1247
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,528
Go to the police station over there and dig through it carefully

1248
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:38,279
Well know

1249
01:03:43,577 --> 01:03:44,577
hello

1250
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:46,913
Are we gonna be enough on our own

1251
01:03:46,914 --> 01:03:48,540
If it fails, it's us

1252
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:51,709
There is no time now

1253
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,419
Even though Yonki is with

1254
01:03:53,754 --> 01:03:56,131
His dad did a lot of things wrong

1255
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,007
But they are my family

1256
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:01,344
Please do something to catch him

1257
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:05,557
What should I do

1258
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:09,060
Yeah, so that's what it means

1259
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,646
We can't send him money

1260
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,315
It's hard to track him if he's moving money to offshore accounts

1261
01:04:14,316 --> 01:04:16,359
Nor does it guarantee your husband's safety

1262
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,612
Yeah, that's why it needs to be done in person

1263
01:04:19,613 --> 01:04:21,948
I need you to lead him on

1264
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:24,325
And don't get excited when you talk to him

1265
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:27,120
We'll guide you when you call

1266
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:28,830
I'm really sorry for asking you to do this

1267
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,665
There's no need to be sorry

1268
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,167
There's no other way

1269
01:04:34,879 --> 01:04:36,880
There's a phone call. Phone call

1270
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:38,798
Hey, come on, get ready.

1271
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:39,674
- Hey, be quiet. - Wait

1272
01:04:43,971 --> 01:04:44,929
Pick up!

1273
01:04:49,768 --> 01:04:51,019
hello

1274
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:53,021
I am Jiang Haishang

1275
01:04:54,106 --> 01:04:57,108
You just do what I say and he'll be fine, okay

1276
01:04:57,484 --> 01:04:58,735
Do you have the money

1277
01:04:59,236 --> 01:05:01,905
I'll send you my bank account number now

1278
01:05:01,906 --> 01:05:02,739
- Are you an idiot? - Ah

1279
01:05:03,824 --> 01:05:05,617
Why would I give you $2 billion

1280
01:05:05,618 --> 01:05:07,035
- Uh-huh. - Wait

1281
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,954
- Wait a minute. - You son of a bitch

1282
01:05:09,997 --> 01:05:12,665
I gave you my money and my son is still dead

1283
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:15,835
I don't know if you're gonna kill my husband this time

1284
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,004
How could I possibly send you money

1285
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:19,422
You don't even try

1286
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,257
Then your husband will die, too

1287
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:23,801
Well, thank you for that

1288
01:05:25,012 --> 01:05:26,512
What you say

1289
01:05:26,513 --> 01:05:27,597
hello

1290
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,557
You killed my son

1291
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,517
If you kill my husband again

1292
01:05:31,518 --> 01:05:32,769
Then you tell me who the money goes to

1293
01:05:33,354 --> 01:05:34,771
You're going overseas anyway

1294
01:05:35,814 --> 01:05:37,273
Isn't it

1295
01:05:37,608 --> 01:05:39,734
I'll give you $2 million

1296
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:42,904
You pay me in person and you pay me in person

1297
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,240
I'll give it to you as soon as I know my husband is alive

1298
01:05:45,282 --> 01:05:47,825
You are so grand, ma 'am

1299
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:49,619
good

1300
01:05:51,163 --> 01:05:54,165
Then you'll give me $2 million tomorrow in a suitcase

1301
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:55,917
There are

1302
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,543
If you put a tracker in there

1303
01:05:57,544 --> 01:05:59,003
Or some weird little stunt where I kill your husband and meet you at your house

1304
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:03,341
Got it!

1305
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:04,968
Until 1:00 a.m. tomorrow

1306
01:06:04,969 --> 01:06:07,553
It's on Central Avenue in Sun Hill and you're driving here alone

1307
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:09,222
Have you got it

1308
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:11,349
I can't drive.

1309
01:06:11,392 --> 01:06:13,101
I need a driver

1310
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:15,520
- Oh, my God. - Don't you agree

1311
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,438
Is the deal off?

1312
01:06:17,439 --> 01:06:19,107
There can only be one driver

1313
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:20,775
good

1314
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:23,945
We'll close the deal tomorrow and save your husband...

1315
01:06:28,242 --> 01:06:30,118
The whole family looks the same

1316
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,040
- Can I have a glass of water? - Yes

1317
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,208
good

1318
01:06:37,209 --> 01:06:38,418
call

1319
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,378
hard

1320
01:06:44,717 --> 01:06:46,592
A glass of water

1321
01:06:56,103 --> 01:06:57,478
ha

1322
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,025
Wow, this old lady is no ordinary person

1323
01:07:02,026 --> 01:07:04,360
Wow, I really want to catch that guy

1324
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:08,448
Hey, back to who we're sending to drive

1325
01:07:08,449 --> 01:07:10,533
We can't he'll find out

1326
01:07:10,534 --> 01:07:12,118
Who sent that

1327
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:14,370
Hey, tut, if a bad pie is found

1328
01:07:14,371 --> 01:07:16,456
That could be a big deal

1329
01:07:22,546 --> 01:07:24,630
Pretending to be married is not a bad thing

1330
01:07:24,631 --> 01:07:27,884
This is how you start your new life

1331
01:07:27,885 --> 01:07:30,887
Just close your eyes for three months

1332
01:07:33,223 --> 01:07:34,140
the

1333
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:35,558
Did you get the money

1334
01:07:39,313 --> 01:07:40,438
However,

1335
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:42,398
- What does a guy look like? - Ah

1336
01:07:42,399 --> 01:07:43,941
What do you look like?

1337
01:07:44,818 --> 01:07:46,861
Yeah, I'll be right back

1338
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,949
hello

1339
01:07:52,117 --> 01:07:54,577
Why didn't you answer your phone

1340
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:57,288
You're the one who made a busy man like me stop by

1341
01:07:57,289 --> 01:07:58,790
What's going on with this

1342
01:07:58,791 --> 01:07:59,957
Ah, what are you doing again

1343
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:02,293
Business wasn't so good anyway, you know

1344
01:08:02,294 --> 01:08:03,920
What kind of confirmation is this

1345
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:05,421
Feed you this guy you

1346
01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:08,007
This guy's a liar and you can go home

1347
01:08:08,425 --> 01:08:10,635
Well, you can't give him the money and go home

1348
01:08:10,677 --> 01:08:12,553
Hurry up. Hurry up

1349
01:08:12,554 --> 01:08:14,931
- He's an illegal stowaway, too. - Oh, yeah

1350
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,058
You come here you come here

1351
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,768
You're going to drive a car

1352
01:08:18,769 --> 01:08:20,228
Hurry up to come over

1353
01:08:21,522 --> 01:08:22,688
Lao zhang

1354
01:08:22,856 --> 01:08:24,148
What can I do for you

1355
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,650
Hey, Cyclops, get me a boat

1356
01:08:26,318 --> 01:08:27,443
Which day of the

1357
01:08:27,861 --> 01:08:29,570
- Tomorrow. - Tomorrow

1358
01:08:30,197 --> 01:08:31,906
What's all this sudden?

1359
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,159
This is a little difficult

1360
01:08:35,202 --> 01:08:37,578
Maybe with a little more money

1361
01:08:38,122 --> 01:08:39,372
Double to you

1362
01:08:39,832 --> 01:08:41,165
When and how many people

1363
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:42,875
Three at one o 'clock

1364
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:45,294
One point three people, please

1365
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:46,754
good

1366
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:50,425
I think he's on the right track

1367
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,093
All access to China is now blocked

1368
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:52,635
He's the only one who wants to sneak in quietly

1369
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:53,970
He's the only one who wants to sneak in quietly

1370
01:08:55,472 --> 01:08:56,973
Here we are now

1371
01:08:56,974 --> 01:08:57,974
Go up

1372
01:08:58,308 --> 01:09:00,518
Enter the city and turn around

1373
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:03,104
I'll give you the signal and you'll bring him down

1374
01:09:03,147 --> 01:09:04,480
Let's get rid of grandma here

1375
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:05,940
Just take the money and go on the boat

1376
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,233
Why are we the only ones going

1377
01:09:07,234 --> 01:09:08,693
Mama of

1378
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,153
Are you trying to be clever

1379
01:09:10,487 --> 01:09:13,656
You want to take it all without us

1380
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:18,953
You're gonna pick up the money anyway

1381
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,455
What are you gonna do with all this distrust

1382
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:24,041
Do you believe us

1383
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:26,335
And you?

1384
01:09:27,754 --> 01:09:29,839
Hey, we must catch Jiang Hai Shang today

1385
01:09:30,257 --> 01:09:31,716
That guy knows my face with the captain

1386
01:09:31,717 --> 01:09:33,259
So you guys just follow me

1387
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,511
Get out of the car and look around

1388
01:09:35,512 --> 01:09:36,888
good

1389
01:09:40,058 --> 01:09:42,143
Jang Yi-soo set out

1390
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,772
Oh, shit. That's fucking bad luck

1391
01:09:49,693 --> 01:09:50,985
Ha!

1392
01:09:59,286 --> 01:10:00,328
Get on the bus

1393
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,163
Put the money in the back seat, please

1394
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:03,206
So I can see

1395

She's on her way with a chauffeur

1396
01:10:20,432 --> 01:10:22,016
No cops with you

1397
01:10:22,476 --> 01:10:23,684
There is no

1398
01:10:24,228 --> 01:10:26,812
When they get to Central Avenue follow the battle plan

1399
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:29,398
You have to do what I say, okay

1400
01:10:30,234 --> 01:10:34,570
This guy knows how to keep his fucking mouth shut

1401
01:10:34,571 --> 01:10:37,156
He still thinks he's our boss

1402
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,841
- Detective. - Yeah

1403

Big brother found the abandoned factory area

1418
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:47,935
But the search was too extensive

1419
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:49,562
It takes a while

1420
01:11:49,563 --> 01:11:51,897

Hey, you guys get this guy out of here

01:25:42,645 --> 01:25:45,021
What happened to him? Did he die

1678
01:25:45,022 --> 01:25:46,148
Fed up!

1679
01:25:53,322 --> 01:25:54,114
It's nice to be

1680

And who the hell is this little bastard

True his mama

1683
01:26:36,407 --> 01:26:37,574
Step on the gas.

1684
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,665
Hello the

Get out of here, you little bastards

1687
01:27:18,115 --> 01:27:20,659
That's how you start a new life

1688
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,249
The eldest brother

1689
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:30,001
First of all, Zhang Yi Zhu threw off Jiang Hai is still

1690
01:27:30,294 --> 01:27:31,545
But Jiang Haishang is the fucking kid

1691
01:27:31,796 --> 01:27:33,255
And now he's on the run after stabbing a vigilante

1692
01:27:33,798 --> 01:27:35,048
The fuck

1693

01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:41,221
Ah, the monitor took him to the hospital

1696
01:27:41,555 --> 01:27:43,765
Eldest brother could not get in touch with Jang Yi-soo

1697
01:27:43,766 --> 01:27:44,891
Don't answer the phone

1698
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:46,434
Looks like he took the money and ran

1699
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:49,813
The gang that staged the kidnapping downtown

1700
01:27:49,814 --> 01:27:51,022
caught

1701

A nationwide manhunt is underway for the stabbing of one of the vigilantes

1702
01:27:52,483 --> 01:27:54,526
After the escape of the main culprit Jiang mou

01:27:58,614 --> 01:27:59,572
On suspicion of murder.

On suspicion of murder.

1707
01:27:59,991 --> 01:28:00,907
Trade at ransom

1708
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:01,658
Trade at ransom

1709
01:28:01,659 --> 01:28:02,242
Jang, an Ethnic Korean with 2 million dollars

1710
01:28:02,285 --> 01:28:03,785
Jang, an Ethnic Korean with 2 million dollars

1711
01:28:04,203 --> 01:28:07,205
Police speculated that Jang would smuggle himself into China

1712
01:28:07,206 --> 01:28:09,499
So they're searching the west coast

1713
01:28:16,841 --> 01:28:17,882
fuck

1714
01:28:21,804 --> 01:28:23,471
- Hello. - One-eyed

1715
01:28:23,764 --> 01:28:24,472
What's the matter

1716
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,391
Please find me a ship to China

1717
01:28:26,767 --> 01:28:27,934
A ship to China

1718
01:28:28,728 --> 01:28:30,895
Ah, no boats now

1719
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:32,981
Oh, fuck you to find it for me

1720
01:28:33,149 --> 01:28:35,066
Ha, you think a boat is a taxi

1721
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:36,776
That's all of a sudden

1722
01:28:36,777 --> 01:28:38,278
What else was I supposed to do

1723
01:28:38,571 --> 01:28:40,447
- Fuck. - I told you there was no boat

1724
01:28:40,698 --> 01:28:41,948
I'll give you double double

1725
01:28:42,241 --> 01:28:43,992
If it was double that, there'd be a boat

1726
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:47,203
Hiss but there's no room for this one

1727
01:28:47,204 --> 01:28:48,455
Mama of

1728

I'll give you double double, you little bastard

1729
01:28:51,876 --> 01:28:52,709
Where are you

1730
01:28:52,918 --> 01:28:55,462
I'm sending my youngest son to pick you up right now

1731
01:28:56,088 --> 01:28:57,339
From behind the waterfront parking lot

01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:09,549
Brains are smarter than they look

Well, that's smart

1775

You need a good beating

Oh, yeah. I told him to catch criminals

How did they send someone to the funeral

01:37:14,503 --> 01:37:16,045
Fuck you, ma Sai, you boy

You worked your ass off, son

01:37:37,943 --> 01:37:39,777
And they put a warrant out on me

1819
01:37:40,362 --> 01:37:43,072
And just say it's hard and that's it

1820
01:37:55,294 --> 01:37:56,586
I knew it

1821
01:38:01,133 --> 01:38:03,634
Son of a bitch
