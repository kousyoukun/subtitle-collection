1
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,376
"So, even though he wanted to do a lot as President,

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,725
"he died of pneumonia after only 32 days.

3
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,603
"So, we can all learn from William Henry Harrison

4
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:07,024
"to wear our coats and wash our hands,
so we have better immune systems.

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,734
"The end."

6
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,200
Good job, Annie.

7
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,411
Okay, Annie B., your turn.

8
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:25,417
You sure there's time?
I don't wanna keep anyone from vacation.

9
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,627
Just get up here.

10
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,714
- Where's your essay?
- Up here.

11
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,342
And it's more of a performance piece.

12
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,094
Here we go.

13
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,596
My president is Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,809
He was elected in 1932, when almost everyone was poor.

15
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,145
So, pretty much just like now, but without the lnternet.

16
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,108
Everyone except the front row, you be the poor people.

17
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,861
You're hungry and mad.
So, growl and stomp your feet.

18
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,037
Front row, good news, you're the rich people.

19
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,331
Laugh and clap like you're better than everybody.

20
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:14,299
But FDR didn't like it that everyone was poor,
so, he gave them all jobs.

21
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,468
He called it the New Deal.

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,721
Work hard, and you get rich.

23
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,266
So, when I tap you, you're rich.

24
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,810
He had people build roads and got paid.

25
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,355
Cut down trees and got paid.

26
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,150
Made it easy to buy a house, go to college.

27
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,152
Soon, the whole country was happy.

28
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,945
But don't worry, rich people.

29
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,073
You're still better than everyone
because you get even richer!

30
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,583
Good job, Annie.
Have a good vacation, everyone!

31
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,836
- You gonna make it in time?
- I always do.

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,714
- We'll cover for you. Good luck.
- Luck's for suckers.

33
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,735
Tomorrow...
To-To-Tomorrow

34
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,820
To-Tomorrow

35
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:24,286
It's the hard-knock life for us

36
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,959
- Excuse me! Do you have any time left?
- I have about 10 minutes.

37
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,669
- I'll return it for you.
- Really?

38
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,754
Promise.

39
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,715
Thanks!

40
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,279
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

41
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:12,626
I think I'm gonna like it I'm sure I'm gonna like it

42
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,338
I think I'm gonna like it here

43
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,634
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

44
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:25,055
five, four, three, two, one.

45
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,519
Light it up!

46
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,607
How many of you guys want some free Stacks phones, huh?

47
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,984
I can't hear you!

48
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,541
Any reservations for Bennett?

49
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,042
Honey, I told you.

50
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,088
If anyone I think
could even remotely be your parents walk in,

51
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,048
I'm gonna let you know.
And I mean remotely.

52
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,303
Name's Bennett, Senate, Pomegranate, black, white, other.

53
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,804
I'll let you know.

54
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,181
- I'm guessing you're gonna wait anyway.
- Yep.

55
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,830
Get your free Stacks phone.
Never drop a call.

56
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,374
Thanks, thanks. Cool.

57
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,876
Free Stacks phone. Okay?

58
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,337
- Thank you. Thank you.
- All right.

59
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,048
And there we are, ma'am. Free Stacks phone.
Never drop a call.

60
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,842
I'm totally gonna vote for you for mayor now.

61
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,762
Yeah, well, you know what?
This isn't a campaign event.

62
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,096
But I would totally love that.

63
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,186
Okay, that's it. We're done. Thanks.

64
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,563
- Hose me down. I feel like I'm on fire.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,731
You should clean your tongue.

66
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,524
You kissed a few babies.
You don't want to catch colic.

67
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,902
- You know what? You're right.
- Will!

68
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,363
You shake 500 hands, and you tell me how you feel, huh?

69
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,405
Feel like a zookeeper.

70
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,115
- Marry me, Will!
- Okay, sure.

71
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,306
Sorry.

72
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,351
It's okay. I just come for the cannoli.

73
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,728
- I'll see you next Friday?
- You know it.

74
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,241
- Hey, girl. How'd it go?
- Nah.

75
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,576
- Can I?
- Sure.

76
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,286
As long as you give those to my lady.

77
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,413
Thanks.

78
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,232
Freeze!

79
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,735
I said freeze, you little rat.

80
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,779
I know you heard me.

81
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,905
Get over here.

82
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,868
These are from Lou.

83
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,787
They look like they're from Lou.

84
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,372
I'll tell him you loved them.

85
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,041
You think the world wants a smart-mouthed little girl?

86
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,044
No, they don't, or you wouldn't be here.

87
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:48,467
And the only reason you are here
is because I get $157 a week from the state.

88
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,178
Which, believe me, is not worth it.

89
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,681
I should put a leash on you, you little...

90
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,266
You're so pretty.

91
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,729
I used to be a bright star.

92
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,733
I was in the biggest band in the world, C+C Music Factory.

93
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,985
About to go on Arsenio Hall Show.

94
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,362
September 16th, 1991.

95
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,074
But I was too good for them!
Fired me right before I went out on stage.

96
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,826
You have a very pretty voice.

97
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,786
I will die with that secret!

98
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,335
Hey, you little monster,
I wasn't done with you! Get back here!

99
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,671
I haven't told you
how I was almost one of Hootie's Blowfish.

100
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,884
How did I get here?

101
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,763
- Did you find them?
- Nah, but it's okay.

102
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,765
- So sorry.
- Sorry, Annie.

103
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,891
The witch will hear us.

104
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,685
- They're never gonna be at that restaurant.
- Be quiet, Pepper. Yes, they are.

105
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,229
You be quiet, lsabella.

106
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,606
Annie's never gonna find her family.
None of us are.

107
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,858
- Don't say that.
- Don't listen to her, Mia.

108
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,528
You're gonna get adopted. I promise.

109
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:54,074
You keep saying that. I'm almost 13.
No one wants a teenager.

110
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,660
Yes, they do.
We all have families somewhere.

111
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,746
- Can you read your note again?
- Okay.

112
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,706
Oh, God. For the millionth time?

113
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,959
Yeah, read it, Annie. But quietly.

114
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,257
They went to Domani's, ordered two cannolis,

115
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,800
and wrote me this note.

116
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,762
"Please take care of our baby.
Her name's Annie.

117
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,556
"We'll be back to get her soon.

118
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,478
"There's half a locket around her neck,
and we have the other half,

119
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,190
"so when we come for her,
you'll know that she's our girl."

120
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,400
Can I see it?

121
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,656
They're gonna come back for all of us.
I promise.

122
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:40,412
Maybe far away

123
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:45,208
Or maybe real nearby

124
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,421
He may be pouring her coffee

125
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:55,051
She may be straightening his tie!

126
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,180
Maybe in a house

127
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:04,311
All hidden by a hill

128
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,607
She's sitting playing piano

129
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,153
He's sitting paying a bill!

130
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,322
Betcha they're young

131
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,158
Betcha they're smart

132
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:22,203
Bet they collect things Like ashtrays, and art!

133
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,623
Betcha they're good

134
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,375
Why shouldn't they be?

135
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,794
Their one mistake

136
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,133
Was giving up me!

137
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,181
So maybe now it's time

138
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:46,686
And maybe when I wake

139
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:51,566
They'll be there calling me "baby"

140
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,151
Maybe

141
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,090
- Betcha he reads
- Betcha he reads...

142
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,258
- Betcha she sews
- Betcha she sews...

143
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,513
Maybe she's made me A closet of clothes!

144
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,015
Maybe they're strict

145
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,643
As straight as a line

146
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,603
Don't really care

147
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,608
As long as they're mine

148
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,614
So maybe now this prayer's

149
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,032
Maybe now this prayer...

150
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,745
The last one of its kind

151
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:54,122
Won't you please come get your "Baby"

152
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:58,592
Maybe

153
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:30,081
Wake up! Wake up, rats. Get out of bed!

154
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,001
- It's so early.
- And it's Saturday.

155
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,045
Thanks for the time and date.
Now, over to Stormy for the weather.

156
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,505
It's raining!

157
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,176
The city called. They're coming to inspect.
You gotta go and clean this whole place up!

158
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,386
Aren't they supposed to give a couple days' notice?

159
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,430
Aren't I supposed to be married to George Clooney?

160
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,390
Get out of bed and start cleaning!

161
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,100
Who's George Clooney?

162
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,020
Exactly, girlfriend. Exactly.

163
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,607
No breakfast until this place is spotless!

164
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,942
I hate her so much.

165
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,321
And if you find any loose change over a nickel, it's mine.

166
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:07,368
I was having the best dream.
I was ice-skating on real, live ice.

167
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,623
Save your dreams for good stuff.
Like shopping with an unlimited credit card.

168
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,041
Or swimming in candy.

169
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,504
Or flying to the moon in a rocket ship.
All things that will never happen.

170
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,550
Now, clean like your life depends on it.
'Cause it does!

171
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:33,554
It's the hard-knock life.

172
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,280
Wait. What does "hard-knock life" mean?

173
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,824
It means our life sucks.

174
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,536
Then, yeah.

175
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,707
It's the hard-knock life for us!

176
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,877
- 'Steada treated
- We get tricked!

177
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,922
- 'Steada kisses
- We get kicked!

178
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,674
It's the hard-knock life

179
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,717
Less singing and more cleaning!

180
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,762
And make sure my bathroom shines!

181
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,348
But don't touch my medicine cabinet!

182
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,273
It's the hard-knock life for us!

183
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,150
- 'Steada treated
- We get tricked!

184
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,112
- 'Steada kisses
- We get kicked!

185
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,239
It's the hard-knock life

186
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,460
Don't it feel like the wind is always howling?

187
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,505
Don't it seem like there's never any light?

188
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,174
Once a day don't you wanna throw the towel in?

189
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,344
It's easier than puttin' up a fight

190
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,097
No one's there when your dreams at night get creepy!

191
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,558
No one cares if you grow or if you shrink!

192
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,562
Empty belly life!

193
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,439
Rotten smelly life!

194
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,025
Full of sorrow life!

195
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,236
No tomorrow life!

196
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,031
Santa Claus we never see

197
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,992
- Santa Claus
- What's that? Who's he?

198
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,661
No one cares for you a bit

199
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,831
When you're a foster kid!

200
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,958
It's the hard-knock life!

201
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:24,881
"Make my bathroom shine!
But don't touch my medicine cabinet!"

202
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,466
Good one, Mia.

203
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,679
- It's the hard-knock life for us
- Yank the whiskers from her chin

204
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,724
- It's the hard-knock life for us
- Jab her with a safety pin

205
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,435
- 'Steada treated, we get tricked
- Send her to the loony bin

206
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,188
'Steada kisses, we get kicked

207
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm so sorry!

208
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,156
- Toss me the broom!
- Incoming.

209
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,659
Plastic!

210
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,619
Paper! Can!

211
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,962
- It's the hard-knock life for us
- Yank the whiskers from her chin

212
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,798
- It's the hard-knock life for us
- Jab her with a safety pin

213
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,717
- No one cares for you a bit
- Send her to the loony bin

214
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,637
When you're a foster kid!

215
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,472
It's the hard-knock life

216
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,808
I said no singing and dancing!

217
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,018
It's the hard-knock life

218
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,776
The inspector's here. Here, read a book.
Braid her hair. Blow on this.

219
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,654
Put this together. It's a kitty cat.

220
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,739
- What should I do?
- Pray.

221
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,700
I've tried. It hasn't worked yet.

222
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,453
Okay. Showtime!
You guys, act well cared-for.

223
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,581
We love you, Miss Hannigan!

224
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,376
Take it down a thousand.
Nobody's gonna believe that.

225
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,088
Get under here.

226
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,720
Well, hello there.

227
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,680
Are you Colleen Hannigan?

228
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,100
My maiden name. But I'm not married to it,
if you know what I mean.

229
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,728
- No.
- Come on in. The girls are just recreating.

230
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,113
- Should we start here in the bathroom?
- Why, Mr. lnspector, how forward you are.

231
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,157
But I'm right behind you.

232
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,450
- What?
- What?

233
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,535
- No, I'm asking you.
- This way.

234
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,870
Wait, what?

235
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,538
Your arms are so strong!

236
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,914
The dude dropped this.

237
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,083
This has all of our information.

238
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,711
- Really?
- You're kidding.

239
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,797
- Damn. I've been in a lot of homes.
- This says I've been in millions.

240
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,966
That's your Social Security number, dummy.

241
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,052
What's a scoso curcurity murder?

242
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,429
It's what the government uses to keep track of us.

243
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:40,683
Wait. This is what I need to get my records.
And find my parents.

244
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,602
I'll copy it down. Plan your exit.

245
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,187
Okay.

246
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,690
You know, people come for the bathroom,
but they stay for the bedroom.

247
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,400
- What?
- You know it.

248
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,194
Can I go to the library to study?

249
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:55,656
Can we talk about this after the handsome
inspector with no wedding ring is gone?

250
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,866
Okay.

251
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,827
Can I have some floss?

252
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,538
I think I have some nutritious breakfast
stuck in my teeth.

253
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,664
What?

254
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,370
Pretty sure I saw some in the medicine cabinet.

255
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,417
Right there?

256
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,088
You know, I just remembered.
We're out of floss.

257
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,257
Maybe you wanna pick some up on your way to the library.

258
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,759
Thank you, Miss Hannigan.

259
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,095
- Bye, Mr. lnspector.
- Bye, now.

260
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,346
Seems like a great kid.

261
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,389
Yeah, she seems great.

262
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,772
I know that run. How much you need, mija?

263
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,941
$43.55.

264
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,110
- By when?
- Now?

265
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,946
Go rob Bank of America.
Here, I'll loan you my mask.

266
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,240
I'll work for it. Please, Lou.

267
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,742
That face.

268
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,120
Take the expired drinks from the cooler.
Go ahead.

269
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,454
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

270
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,915
Whoa, what are you doing, girl?

271
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,794
This ain't no Whole Foods.
Don't throw them out. Change the date.

272
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,297
I believe in hard work.
I don't just settle for "okay."

273
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,967
"Great" is all I know.

274
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
I built my company to be a worldwide leader.

275
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:03,307
And that's what I wanna do with the city.
I wanna make it great again.

276
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,059
You're 20 points down in the polls.

277
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,812
You've got billions to spend and it's not working.

278
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,480
How are you gonna change people's minds?

279
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,232
Everybody wants to count my money.

280
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,567
4.3 billion.

281
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,319
You know, I have feelings.
And I feel for people that are out there...

282
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,988
- Baba Booey! Baba Booey!
- Yes. See.

283
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,366
That's probably one of my satisfied customers right there.

284
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,161
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is terrible.

285
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,745
Do you really think a businessman can run the city?

286
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,416
At Stacks Mobile,
I made a cell network that never drops a call.

287
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,085
As mayor, I'm gonna make a government

288
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,838
that never drops a citizen.

289
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,674
Yeah, as long as those citizens live below 96th Street.

290
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:40,261
You're lucky you can't vote yet, mija.
Politicians are all liars.

291
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,054
What dates should I change these to?

292
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,390
One week for the milk.
Two weeks for the juice.

293
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,685
You need to smile more.
You only smiled four times.

294
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,728
Is that right? Really?

295
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,189
Voters respond 23% more favorably to full-teeth smiles.

296
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,982
Yeah. How about thumbs up, huh?

297
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,026
Sixteen percent better if you give them a single.

298
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,360
Thirty-eight percent if you shoot them the double.

299
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,488
Why do I get the feeling like I'm wasting
my time here? Am I gonna win, or not?

300
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,450
- 'Cause this seems like a waste of time.
- You hired me to win. You're gonna win.

301
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,452
- Put this on.
- Why? I'm already dressed.

302
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,995
- How you doing?
- Here.

303
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,705
Whoa, I gotta feed the hobos?

304
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,373
Don't say "hobos." Say "bums."

305
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,042
For some crazy reason, everybody thinks

306
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,628
you're a rich elitist that can't relate to regular people.

307
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,339
So, the girl from Oxford
is trying to tell me how to keep it real.

308
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,049
I'm telling you if you want a chance at this,

309
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,717
you're gonna have to remember where you came from.

310
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,219
Okay, Gatsby?

311
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,262
Compliment them on the food, but not too much.

312
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,056
- I ain't eating this food.
- You're gonna eat the food.

313
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,308
And you're gonna like it,
but you're not gonna love it, okay?

314
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,101
We don't want to seem like we're pandering.

315
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,520
- I don't eat hobo food.
- All right. That's good.

316
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,858
How we doing, folks? Starving?

317
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,401
How do you sleep at night?

318
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,403
Silk sheets and Ambien.

319
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,113
Look at all these handsome faces!

320
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,824
There you go. All right.

321
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,534
And here we go. God bless.

322
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,996
Bet you never had mashed potatoes, Mr. Stacks.

323
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,750
Are you kidding me?

324
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,337
Why, my grandmother made some of
the best mashed potatoes in Queens.

325
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,507
You know, that's where I'm from.
Born and raised.

326
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,343
On the playground's where I spent most of my days.

327
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,511
And look at this.

328
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,931
It's not amazing, but it ain't terrible.
Look at this.

329
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,188
Went down the wrong pipe.

330
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,777
This is disgusting.

331
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,570
Look, it's terrible.

332
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,030
Oh, God. You're a child.

333
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,540
Well, how do you guys think that went?

334
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,168
Nash, you saw it. Would you vote for me
if you didn't work for me?

335
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,461
No, sir.

336
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,672
Thank you for your honesty. You're fired.

337
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,175
That didn't take long.

338
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,929
And there are already parodies.

339
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,764
Mashed potatoes Mashed potatoes

340
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,975
Mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes In Queens

341
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,519
- See, this is why China's winning.
- Not really.

342
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,899
Maybe this is a blessing in disguise.

343
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,985
Just because you can run for mayor,
doesn't mean that you should.

344
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,945
We already discussed this is great for my profile.

345
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,155
It's going to grow the company.

346
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,241
Plus, the city needs me.

347
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,493
All right. Take it easy, Batman.

348
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,829
You let all your employees talk to you like this?

349
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,247
The ones that make me billions, I do.

350
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,791
You make me mayor, you can say anything you want.

351
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,917
Hey!

352
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,755
Oh, no. Not again.

353
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,256
Nash. Why we stopping?

354
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,925
Sorry, Mr. Stacks. I'll fix it.

355
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,939
Next!

356
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,193
I'd like to get my records please.

357
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,528
You'll need DOH form number 4380...

358
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,614
.7-8.

359
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,451
- And $43 and...
- 55 cents.

360
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,245
And an application signed by a parent or a...

361
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,955
Guardian. Bam.

362
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,091
It's all there.

363
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,891
Are you going to stare at me the whole time?

364
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:14,975
Sorry.

365
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,492
- Next!
- Can you read it? I'm too nervous.

366
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,249
"Annie Bennett.
Abandoned outside 26th Precinct.

367
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,252
"Age estimate at time of abandonment, four years.

368
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,422
"Placed in state foster care. No further data."

369
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,215
What does "no further data" mean?

370
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,468
That's all there is to know about you.
Sorry, honey.

371
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,596
It's okay. I'll figure it out.

372
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,874
The sun'II come out tomorrow

373
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,086
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

374
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,214
There'II be sun

375
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,052
Just thinkin' about tomorrow

376
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,515
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow

377
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,727
'Til there's none

378
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,896
When I'm stuck with a day

379
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,649
That's gray, and lonely

380
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,320
I just stick out my chin and grin

381
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:53,157
And say, oh

382
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,992
Faster, Daddy!

383
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,621
The sun'II come out tomorrow

384
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:03,417
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

385
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,754
Come what may

386
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,673
Tomorrow, tomorrow

387
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,718
I love you, tomorrow

388
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:17,097
You're always a day away!

389
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,572
When I'm stuck with a day

390
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,117
That's gray, and lonely

391
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,496
I just stick out my chin and grin

392
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,626
And say, oh

393
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,421
The sun'II come out tomorrow

394
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,884
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

395
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,720
Come what may

396
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,723
Tomorrow, tomorrow

397
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,518
I love you, tomorrow

398
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:06,981
You're always a day away!

399
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,901
Tomorrow, tomorrow

400
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,571
I love you, tomorrow

401
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:19,159
You're always a day

402
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,161
Away!

403
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,425
Get it! Get it!

404
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,801
- Come on!
- Hey!

405
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,177
Throw something at it!

406
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,721
Throw the can!

407
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,015
- Hey! Stop!
- Mind your own business!

408
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,436
What's going on?

409
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,521
I don't know. I'm not a chemist.

410
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,608
Jimmy Neutron here had me
throw this experimental engine in.

411
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,443
It shows that he cares about the environment.

412
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,445
You know, that he's forward-thinking.

413
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,741
Oh, great. Here they come with the pictures.
We gotta distract her. Something whimsical.

414
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,867
Let's get into a leaf fight!

415
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,577
Ma'am.

416
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,037
- Okay, okay.
- I'm gonna call a car.

417
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,788
- Hey!
- I'm gonna go walk.

418
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,123
What?

419
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,583
- Where's he going?
- I wanna be alone.

420
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,210
- We don't really have time.
- I know how to walk down the street!

421
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,712
I'll text you directions!

422
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,921
Don't need them.

423
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,549
- This is all your fault.
- Take it easy, pantsuit.

424
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,552
And, you... I'm sorry.

425
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:25,225
Hey, Stacks!
Your phone bill's killing me, bro!

426
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,729
- Get it!
- I told you to stop!

427
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,487
Try to hit it!

428
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,821
Leave it alone!

429
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,907
Hey!

430
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,826
- All right, kick it! Kick it!
- Stop!

431
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,291
- Leave it alone!
- See how scared it is!

432
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,081
Leave it...

433
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,919
- Watch where you're going, kid!
- Are you okay?

434
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,921
- Let's get out of here!
- You could've got run over.

435
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,215
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry. You be careful.

436
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,593
- Why're you running?
- Gets me to places quicker.

437
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,265
Little kids. Kids with germs.

438
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,944
How was the library?

439
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,237
Educational.

440
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,905
Well, I have some more education for you.

441
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,658
I told the inspector I don't wanna foster you anymore.

442
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,285
As of next week, you're somebody else's problem.

443
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,704
Did they say who?

444
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,832
Not a who, sweetie. A what.

445
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,291
Group home.

446
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,377
Okay.

447
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,715
Maybe that'll teach you to stop running your mouth.

448
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,348
So, where are we with our new phones?

449
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,309
- Well, we've got the battery up to 150 hours.
- That's not a week.

450
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,312
I said I need the charge
to last a week, Grace. Specifically.

451
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,846
At the moment, unfortunately,
the phone is burning up in people's hands.

452
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,941
What?

453
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,069
That's what I told Mom.
And she says to me, she...

454
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,989
You burned me!

455
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,240
Don't worry. She signed a waiver.

456
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,867
You burned me!

457
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:05,909
What up, Guy-O?

458
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,495
You're up. Five points in the polls.

459
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,165
Really? They liked that he vomited on a homeless man?

460
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,877
No, Grace. They liked the fact that
he saved a little girl from getting hit by a van.

461
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,088
Some guy recorded it, put it on the Internet.
Check it out.

462
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,174
"I'm a little girl who doesn't see where I'm going.

463
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,844
"Well, look! I bumped into the future
mayor of New York who just saved my life!"

464
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,345
This is fantastic, Will.

465
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,306
I'm telling you.
It's the most human thing you've done

466
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,933
- this entire campaign, all due respect.
- None taken.

467
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,603
You didn't tell me you saved a little girl.
You didn't tell me anything.

468
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,687
Like Batman.

469
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,939
Hey, listen to me.
You gotta capitalize on this.

470
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,473
- Of course we do.
- You invite her to lunch.

471
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,650
- No.
- See how she's doing.

472
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,360
Snap a few pics. The press'II eat this up.

473
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,112
- Do we know who she is?
- That's the best part.

474
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,781
She's a foster kid from Harlem.

475
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,950
Did you hear what I said? Foster kid! Harlem!

476
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,869
Your undereye vein is bulging.

477
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,022
- I'm gonna go get her.
- No. I'm gonna let Grace go get her.

478
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,414
- What? Why?
- What? That's a terrible idea!

479
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,542
Do you actually want 5-hour Energy
to go over there and scare this little child?

480
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,378
- I don't even know what this is about.
- Grace, please. For me, Grace. Please.

481
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,880
- Thank you.
- Will, let me go to Harlem.

482
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,800
- Please. Don't send her.
- They will whoop your ass in Harlem.

483
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,426
- Don't shut me off.
- Thank you.

484
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,719
Don't shut me off!

485
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,808
Yeah.

486
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,019
Is that Colleen Hannigan?

487
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:21,985
I was wanting to talk to you about a girl in your care.

488
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,362
Annie.

489
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,245
I work for William Stacks and
he would love to take Annie out for lunch.

490
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,329
Why?

491
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,249
They ran into each other yesterday.
She didn't tell you?

492
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,667
No.

493
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:42,256
We didn't have a chance
to have our girl-talk jawbone last night.

494
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,841
Annie!

495
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,093
So you said he ran into her?

496
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,430
'Cause I noticed that
her neck did seem a little whiplash-y.

497
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,268
We are happy to make a donation
to the charity of your choice.

498
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,770
Gosh! There's so many to choose from.

499
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,022
- There is.
- Let's see, Save the Whales, of course.

500
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,860
And Clean Water, but you can't have whales without water.

501
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,780
Gosh. You know what?
Just make it out to "cash." I'll divvy it up.

502
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,283
- Perfect.
- Annie!

503
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,784
You know, she's such an angel.

504
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,537
We don't inherit the Earth,
we borrow it from our children.

505
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,830
It's a lovely sentiment.

506
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,331
There she is.

507
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,541
Hi, Annie. I'm Grace.

508
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,878
I work for Mr. Stacks,
the gentleman that you ran into yesterday.

509
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,170
He'd like to invite you to lunch.

510
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,172
I promise we won't keep you long.

511
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,008
You can keep me as long as you want.

512
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,728
- No way!
- Is this for real?

513
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,147
- This car's as big as a subway!
- You're so lucky!

514
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,315
It's incredible.

515
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,318
- Oh, my gosh. I want that!
- Oh, my gosh!

516
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,236
Help yourself to whatever you want.

517
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,571
No way. Really?

518
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,822
Sure.

519
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,075
- Give me this! Give me this! I want this!
- Oh, my God!

520
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,953
- I want that one! I want that!
- This is crazy! My God!

521
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,247
Kids love candy, huh?

522
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,959
Hey, Annie! Maybe I should come with you

523
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,379
and make sure that everything's USDA Grade A awesome, huh?

524
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,464
I'm good. Thanks.

525
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,840
Bye, Annie!

526
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,550
- Bye!
- Later.

527
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,010
- Thanks!
- Oh, my gosh.

528
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,929
Hey, gorgeous!

529
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,805
How does it feel to have a famous kid?

530
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,932
What are you talking about?

531
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,850
It's Annie!

532
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,143
Your Annie!

533
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:23,065
Hey, you wanna go out tonight?
I got my dance pants on.

534
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,150
I haven't hit that rock bottom yet.

535
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,361
I love it when you throw me shade!

536
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,030
- Here, Lou.
- It's okay. She likes me.

537
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,826
Oh, my God, this is so good.

538
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,621
Mr. Stacks would like to take
some pictures with you, if that's all right.

539
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,291
- I guess so. Why?
- People wanna know that you're okay.

540
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,543
- What people?
- Everybody who saw that.

541
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,131
My hair's gigantic.

542
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,052
- We can listen to whatever you like.
- Can you put on talk radio?

543
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,221
Are you sure you don't wanna listen to music?

544
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,182
I love talk radio. It calms me.

545
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,143
So do I. I loved it when I was a little girl.

546
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,813
I used to think that they were all my friends.

547
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:07,901
Sorry, that sounded very sad. Sorry.

548
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,070
I have a lot of friends, so don't worry about me.

549
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,573
I mean, so I work a lot. I do.
And I could have some more friends.

550
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,617
But how many friends do you really need?

551
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:20,706
I mean, if you were my parents asking me,
"Are you fulfilled and are you happy, Grace?"

552
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,207
That's a whole different conversation, right?

553
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,417
But we're not having that conversation.

554
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,087
And, frankly, it's really
not your position to ask me that at all. So...

555
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,672
Okay.

556
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,474
There she is. Our own Little Orphan Annie.

557
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,437
Foster kid.

558
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,778
She's here.

559
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:57,284
Hey, this is the one, right? All right.
Let's get this.

560
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,203
Slow your roll.

561
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,789
- Excuse me?
- Can we eat first? It was a long drive.

562
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, yeah. Go, go.

563
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:09,087
Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's eat.
We got time for that.

564
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,338
All right.

565
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,426
So, how are you feeling from yesterday?

566
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,345
So, what's the hustle?

567
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,806
What makes you think there's a hustle?
There's no hustle.

568
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,974
Come on, come on.

569
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,187
I'm 10. I'm not an idiot.

570
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,022
I never said you were...

571
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,232
an idiot. Or 10.

572
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,652
Truth of the matter is, I don't know how old you are.

573
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,572
- Ten.
- Well, now we know that you're not an idiot.

574
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,742
But there are a lot of people out there that are
and when they saw that photo of us,

575
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,378
they thought that I would make a great mayor.

576
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,870
Why?

577
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,538
Why? Because I'm a...

578
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,749
I'm a rich guy. I saved an orphan.

579
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,585
I'm not an orphan, I'm a foster kid.

580
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,878
And you didn't save me.

581
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,547
I didn't save you? I didn't just
push you out of the way of a van?

582
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,092
Why don't I call that van back
and have him finish up what he...

583
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,719
You know what?

584
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,013
The more we're seen together,
the better it is for my campaign.

585
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,100
- Wait. That's how a mayor gets elected?
- Yes. lnsane, isn't it?

586
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,602
I bet if I moved in with you, you'd become president.

587
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,522
Move in with me?

588
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,525
This is not that kind of party.

589
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,984
That's it. That's it. That's it.

590
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,072
I think he wants to tell you something.

591
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,450
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
Annie coming to live with you.

592
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,618
- What?
- What?

593
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:25,038
From what I understand, it's very crowded where you live.

594
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:29,626
How'd you like some more space?
Is that something that you might like?

595
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,338
Living with the richest guy in the world?
Yeah, that's something I might like.

596
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,882
- Great. Perfect.
- Guy. What are you talking about?

597
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,176
Listen to me. It'll only be for a few weeks.

598
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,886
Then she'll go back to wherever she came from.

599
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,223
Taking in a foster kid, that's
an automatic 15 point jump in the polls.

600
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,724
- Guaranteed.
- You want me to play Daddy?

601
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:49,354
It's easy. All I need is a bed and meals.
You don't have to do anything else.

602
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,440
And you get $157 a week.

603
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,361
Do I look like I need $157 a week?

604
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,406
Everybody needs an extra $157 a week.

605
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,008
You're not really thinking about doing this?

606
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,743
You want photos, right?

607
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,372
- I'm sure there's easier ways to get photos.
- Not with me in them.

608
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,167
Smile.

609
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,669
Mr. Stacks!

610
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,297
- Are you really doing this?
- Yeah, won't even know she's there.

611
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,008
- It's like having a turtle.
- I wonder if she has her shots.

612
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,593
- How was your lunch?
- What's your name?

613
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,637
Her name is Annie, and
she'll be staying with Mr. Stacks for awhile.

614
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,014
He's going to adopt you?

615
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:29,436
No, no, no. I have parents.
This is just temporary. If he gets approved.

616
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,855
- What now?
- Next.

617
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,441
I need a temporary guardian approval, please.

618
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:39,863
There is a six-week waiting period
and you need form NYS 84-...

619
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,281
Sweet Lord.

620
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,493
Hi.

621
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,828
Bam.

622
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:53,710
You know, I don't normally do the site visits,
but I've taken such a liking to young Annie.

623
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,547
I forget sometimes, you know, why I got into this.

624
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,467
It's for my files.

625
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,555
So, does the guardian have
"adequate income to provide basic shelter"?

626
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,771
I'm just gonna go ahead and check that box.

627
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,359
Come on in.

628
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,573
...about $95 per share in cash and stock.

629
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,618
...detonated an explosive while fire...

630
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,834
- Whoa.
- Oh, yeah, whoa.

631
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,462
Hey, is there a co-temporary guardian?

632
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,925
- No.
- Would you like a co-temporary guardian?

633
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,886
Why don't I take these guys on a tour,
and you can get back to work.

634
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,137
Best idea of the day.

635
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,305
I'll come with you.

636
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,225
Will. Will, Will!

637
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:54,145
Okay, so the state says that you must have at least

638
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,606
one water source in...

639
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,275
Check.

640
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,403
And a window that's... Okay.

641
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:06,032
And then at least one chair per 10 persons.

642
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,744
And I think the Starship Enterprise
is gonna count. I'm gonna check that box.

643
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,538
How does it do this?

644
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,914
It's a smart house.

645
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,042
So, it recognizes your voice
and then adjusts itself accordingly.

646
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,669
It's like a friend.

647
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,922
I consider it a friend.
But I have real friends that aren't robots.

648
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:25,802
Let's forget this conversation and
the previous conversation and start afresh.

649
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,721
Got that? Great.

650
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,433
I'm gonna record your voice now, Annie,
and it'll be in the system.

651
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,144
So, just say something into this.

652
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,354
- What should I say?
- Anything.

653
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,566
I think I'm gonna like it here.

654
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,736
Got it.

655
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,280
Great. It's all yours.

656
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,240
Have a go. And I'll be back.

657
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,242
Ma'am?

658
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,746
Excuse me.
You are not allowed to go in there.

659
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,206
This is very nice. Are those halogen bulbs?

660
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,335
- Ma'am.
- This sink is bigger than my entire country.

661
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,723
I think I'm gonna like it here.

662
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,270
I think I'm gonna like it

663
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,607
I'm sure I'm gonna like it

664
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:25,403
I think I'm gonna like it here

665
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,949
So, think it and it shall appear

666
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,744
I think I'm gonna like it here

667
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,955
Because it knows just what you wanna see

668
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,124
Wait, I think it and it comes to me?

669
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,630
Here's something grand for you to play

670
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,095
Wait, I couldn't do that yesterday

671
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,559
I think I'm gonna like it here

672
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,355
It's very hard not to, my dear

673
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:07,946
- Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here
- Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here

674
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,866
- Think I'm gonna like it here
- Think I'm gonna like it here

675
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,410
I think I'm gonna like it here

676
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:20,542
- Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here
- Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here

677
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,754
- Think I'm gonna like it here
- Think I'm gonna like it here

678
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,548
Look!

679
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,384
It knows the temp you're comfy in.

680
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,970
That's great. Can it teach me to swim?

681
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,557
We'll get a coach, no need to fear.

682
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,852
I think I'm gonna like it here

683
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,603
The water's cold!

684
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,773
Everything you've ever dreamed

685
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,318
Is at your fingertips

686
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,738
And if you haven't dreamed it yet

687
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,868
Add it to your wish list

688
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,748
Is this Mr. Stacks' room?

689
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,584
No, Annie, this is your room.

690
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,085
Sweet Lord.

691
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,882
I think I'm gonna like it

692
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,843
I know I'm gonna like it

693
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,971
I know you're gonna like it

694
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,266
Damn right, you're gonna like it

695
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:24,147
I think I'm gonna like it here!

696
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:31,571
- Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here
- Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here

697
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,241
- Think I'm gonna like it here
- Think I'm gonna like it here

698
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,951
I think I'm gonna like it here

699
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:44,459
- Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here
- Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here

700
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:48,713
- Think I'm gonna like it here
- Think I'm gonna like it here

701
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,216
Yes, yes!

702
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,637
The closet was so big, I thought it was the living room.

703
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,639
- Really?
- How big was the living room?

704
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,475
- I thought it was Connecticut.
- Oh, my gosh.

705
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,685
- Is he nice?
- I think so.

706
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,270
He just doesn't know it yet.

707
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,730
We're gonna miss you, Annie.

708
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,191
I'm not. Finally can get a little space in here.

709
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,736
Well, whenever you miss me, all you gotta do is call.

710
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,821
- Bam, bam.
- What? Are you serious?

711
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,365
- Bam.
- Stacks phones?

712
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,909
Even one for you, Pepper.
I know you're gonna miss me. Bam.

713
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,038
No case, huh? This is janky.

714
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,712
Hey, Mr. Will Stacks.

715
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,674
Or should I say Soon-To-Be-Mr.-Mayor?

716
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,842
No, thank you.
We're just waiting on someone.

717
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,762
I'm not looking for temporary companionship.

718
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,013
Not judging you.

719
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,057
God has a path for us all.

720
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,643
- Your path should be away from the car.
- What?

721
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,145
Ma'am, wanna move away from the car, please?

722
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,647
How dare you...

723
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,315
Oh, really, you're gonna spray me?

724
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,608
You think you're better than me?

725
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,026
Is that what it is?
You think you're better than me?

726
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,237
I do. I do think I'm better than you.

727
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,947
- Hey, Miss Hannigan.
- What?

728
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,076
I just wanna thank you for everything you've done for me.

729
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,247
You think your life is a fairy tale?
There is no happily ever after.

730
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,875
And the worst thing is to get a little taste
of something good 'cause it never lasts.

731
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,878
And then all you can taste from then on out is

732
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,297
not that taste.

733
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,134
Just let her talk when she gets like this, remember?

734
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,427
Shut up!

735
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,597
Colleen Hannigan! H-bomb!
Like me on Facebook!

736
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,725
I don't like you in Harlem.
Why would I like you on Facebook?

737
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,561
Come on, rats, let's go!

738
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,229
- Inside!
- Bye, Annie.

739
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,272
Bye.

740
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,108
- What was that?
- Don't worry about it.

741
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,152
All right, Nash, we can take off.

742
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,987
I can't, there's a truck.

743
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,364
Bogey on your left, Nash, bogey on your left. Steady.

744
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,283
No, thank you.
I'm not looking for companionship.

745
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,368
- What is it with this neighborhood?
- No, that's Lou.

746
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,162
- You know her name?
- It's a he.

747
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,832
- Hey, girl.
- Hey. I got you something.

748
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,336
No, thanks. Those things are evil.
They steal your private information

749
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,672
so that big business can spy on you and crush your soul.

750
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,882
Really?

751
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,550
I'm happy for you though, mija.

752
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,928
- Getting off the block. Take care.
- Bye, Lou.

753
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,764
Stay warm, Mr. Stacks.

754
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,308
Sorry. He just doesn't like you.

755
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,353
A lot of people don't like me.
That's why we're doing this.

756
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,772
Don't worry, I got a game face.

757
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,774
Let's take some photos.

758
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,338
My opponent wants to be mayor for two reasons.

759
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,549
To feed his ego, and bolster his business interests.

760
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,428
And now he coincidentally takes in a foster kid?
Come on.

761
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,223
Don't pee in my ear and tell me it's hot rain.

762
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,392
Are you saying Annie is a political move?

763
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,560
I'm surprised he hasn't gotten a dog yet.

764
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,486
Are you sure I can have one?

765
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,196
- No.
- Yes.

766
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:04,450
Look, kids love dogs. Come on,
they see them on the street and they all go...

767
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,285
- Am I right?
- Hello.

768
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,204
- You know, women do the same thing.
- Hello.

769
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,081
Hello.

770
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,752
What about that one?

771
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,464
She was separated from her pack too early.
She just needs a little love.

772
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,218
Don't pick that one, it's licking its own hoo-hah.

773
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:26,556
Hey, girl, we found each other.
I'll never leave you again, I promise.

774
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,391
Annie, what are you gonna name it?

775
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,642
She's like a hurricane.

776
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,769
Sandy. Her name's gonna be Sandy.

777
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,151
I told you.

778
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,070
- Annie, will you take a picture with us?
- Sure.

779
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,990
Thanks, Annie.

780
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,287
She really likes you.

781
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,198
Look.

782
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,836
Hey.

783
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,464
Something wrong?

784
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,759
Couldn't sleep. So quiet up here.

785
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,844
- What you doing?
- I'm working.

786
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,430
- This late?
- Always.

787
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,183
- When do you have fun?
- This is fun.

788
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,978
I haven't been to Disneyland,
but I don't think they have a paperwork ride.

789
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,648
Look, if you're hungry,
there's not a lot of food here. Only takeout.

790
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,982
Fridge.

791
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,943
Cool.

792
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,319
Knock yourself out.

793
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,781
You don't have a cook?
Or like a million servants?

794
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,324
Nope, I don't. I like to be alone.

795
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,159
So why do you need all this space?

796
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,746
'Cause I like to be alone with a lot of space.

797
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,668
Look, I think people surround themselves with other people

798
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,211
just so they can feel loved.
I don't believe in that.

799
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,422
I believe the people that actually love you,
you can count them on one hand.

800
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,675
You know you're making a fist.

801
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,136
Whatever.

802
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,429
Where are your people?

803
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:34,600
Wow, you ask a lot of questions, little one.
My people aren't around.

804
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,270
- You don't want new ones?
- I'm good.

805
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,564
You know what? I am hungry.

806
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:43,359
I can make a meal out of anything.
Pick five ingredients.

807
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,403
- I don't want to.
- Come on, this'll be fun.

808
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,990
- Annie, listen, I don't have time...
- Not work, but almost as fun.

809
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:55,580
All right.
Fusilli, pancetta, steak, pomegranate,

810
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,540
truffle, sun-dried tomatoes.

811
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,668
- I've only heard of two of those things.
- Google it.

812
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,963
- Okay, where are your pots and pans?
- Pots and pans.

813
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,341
I know.

814
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,801
- Cool.
- Cool.

815
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,101
Put some in there.

816
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,814
- Put in some carrot?
- You're not gonna chop that carrot?

817
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,777
You lactose-intolerant?

818
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,154
I'm kid-intolerant.

819
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,366
- How's your cholesterol?
- It's good right now.

820
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,745
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get some supplies. See you later.

821
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,706
Orange you glad I'm back?

822
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,792
The sixth ingredient is my jokes.

823
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,379
Order up.

824
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,757
- Are we really doing this?
- Cheers.

825
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,889
You gotta be kidding me.

826
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,140
Sorry, it's gross.

827
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,809
But you gotta learn to stop spitting.
You're not a camel.

828
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,106
Guy has this crazy idea that I should take you
to a movie premiere tomorrow night.

829
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,399
A movie premiere?

830
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:07,652
Yes.

831
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,071
- Can I bring my friends?
- There's more of you?

832
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,281
More photos. Click, click.

833
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,451
All right. More photos.

834
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,702
More photos.

835
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,997
- It's worse the second time.
- Yeah.

836
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,345
This is kind of like a bunk bed.

837
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,313
- Morning, Annie.
- Good morning, Nash.

838
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,901
I know this sounds crazy, but do you guys
spy on people with your phones?

839
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,111
Why?

840
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,029
I really need to find some people.

841
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,490
Come with me.

842
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,868
Come on, you got it. There you go.

843
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,497
Stacks Mobile Control Center.

844
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,708
We can trace every call, every data transmission

845
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,377
made on every carrier over the past 20 years.

846
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,545
Whoa.

847
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,423
People shouldn't be scared of governments.

848
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,717
They should be scared of cell phone companies.

849
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,885
- Check for Bennett.
- Checking.

850
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,222
That's a lot of Bennetts.

851
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,974
Can you please go back six years?

852
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,726
Around the 26th Precinct.

853
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,730
It'll take a bit, but we'll let you know.

854
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,939
Thanks.

855
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,327
Oh, my God!

856
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,829
Did Hannigan catch you?

857
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,456
No, she's passed out.

858
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,541
Things that make you go glug-glug.

859
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,170
Mr. Stacks, who are you wearing?

860
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,296
Armani.

861
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,715
Annie, who are you wearing?

862
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,175
This is my friend lsabella's,

863
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,219
and this I think I found somewhere.

864
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,306
Annie, how'd you like the French toast
you had for breakfast this morning?

865
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,058
Wait. How'd you know that?

866
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,310
You tweeted it. @annie4realz

867
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:08,856
I started you a Twitter account.
1 .3 million followers so far.

868
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,275
You get it? "4realz."

869
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,360
Because she's "for reals."

870
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,363
- All right.
- You get it, right?

871
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,742
Hey! Stacks Phones! Never drop a call.

872
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,577
And vote for me, too.

873
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,708
Things happen for a reason.

874
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,002
Says the boy who doesn't have to go home
to the moon every night.

875
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,212
Then don't go.

876
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,465
You know it's not my choice.

877
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,008
What the hell is happening?

878
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,636
- Her moon tears are running out.
- Of course they are.

879
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,597
Then I'll make it my choice.

880
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,350
Did you just grab yourself?

881
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,601
You're buzzing.

882
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,353
It's your phone.

883
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,979
Hey, it's one of our phones.

884
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,731
It's time.

885
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,651
- That cost us $500,000.
- What?

886
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:57,154
Product placement. It's the only thing
that's keeping the movie business afloat.

887
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,157
Execute your orders and return to the queendom.

888
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:04,036
You succeed, and your mother will be set free.

889
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,329
If not...

890
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,211
We are ready down there.

891
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,631
Once the moon sets, we will attack.

892
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:16,924
Thanks, Sakana.

893
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,092
What is going on?

894
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,970
- The fish are going to attack the moon.
- But they should attack already.

895
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,555
There's not gonna be enough time for Kyle and Saffron

896
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,557
to get away from the Luna Monsters.

897
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:29,937
Attack, Sakana, attack!

898
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,023
Quiet.

899
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,203
Sakana, Sakana!

900
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,538
Sakana!

901
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,956
Sit down.

902
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,668
I can't believe Sakana told on them.

903
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,713
Of course you can. You can't trust
the fish people. Gwarklark warned them.

904
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,006
I think she was bluffing.

905
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,008
Nah, it was a warning.
They come back in the next movie.

906
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,385
- There's a next movie?
- There're four more.

907
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,970
Shut up!

908
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,972
- Whoa!
- Cool!

909
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,851
I gotta get back to work.

910
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,144
You can't stay for the party?

911
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:14,356
No. I haven't worked in two hours
and three of my men think I'm dead.

912
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,524
I'm alive.

913
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,986
You've worked enough. If your building
gets any taller it's gonna hit the sun.

914
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,990
You got this crazy way of turning a no into a yes.

915
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,950
How do you do that?

916
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:29,288
I think when people say no,
they're just really scared of saying yes.

917
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,332
Well, I'm not scared. No!

918
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,958
- Please!
- No!

919
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,668
- Please.
- Yes.

920
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,545
- Yes!
- Come on!

921
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,130
Listen. I don't know.

922
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,590
- Well, okay.
- This is amazing.

923
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,294
Mr. Stacks! Will!

924
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,714
I can't believe how long you've been here.

925
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,134
We're gonna be late for the Jets-Giants game.
You're doing the ceremonial coin flip.

926
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,428
And remember, they're both New York teams,

927
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,431
so, heads or tails, you gotta be equally happy and sad.

928
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,474
You're right.

929
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,059
You go, I'll stay here with the kids.

930
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,394
- You sure?
- Yeah.

931
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,770
All right, come on, let's go.

932
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,190
What is that?

933
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,405
Look, Tessie!

934
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,329
Can we make one more stop?

935
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,456
- Sure.
- Don't wake up Hannigan.

936
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,292
- Bye!
- Bye, girls!

937
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,924
You come here every Friday?

938
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,468
It's the only day they serve cannoli.

939
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,806
And that's all you've got to go on?

940
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,811
Do you think you'll remember what they look like?

941
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,855
I think I'll just know.

942
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,467
What are you doing still up?

943
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,595
Where did you get all of this stuff?

944
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,181
Where'd you get it? Where'd you get it?

945
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,476
We went with Annie to the movies,
and we got candy and soda,

946
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,978
and we went ice skating, and Mr. Stacks is so cool,

947
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,355
and I got fish earrings.

948
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,522
Nice, Tessie.

949
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,316
I can't keep a secret. I got fish earrings.

950
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,484
Pack it up. It's going back.

951
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,985
- Why?
- Because you don't deserve it.

952
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,154
Yes, we do. It's from our friend.

953
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,741
She's not your friend. And neither is Mr. Stacks.

954
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,577
They're all just a bunch of parasites
who suck the life out of you

955
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,955
and move on once you're not the shiny
new object in the Factory anymore.

956
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,207
You're being mean.

957
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,584
I'm being educational!

958
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,796
Now pack it up! You look ridiculous.

959
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,843
I didn't fall.

960
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,181
...reptile in the bathtub.

961
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:38,227
Mama.

962
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,276
Little girls, little girls

963
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:49,196
Everywhere I turn I can see them

964
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,785
Little girls, little girls

965
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,871
Night and day I eat, sleep and breathe them

966
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,998
Get out of here!

967
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:04,253
I should be anywhere but here

968
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,215
Private planes, on the stage or MTV

969
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,636
But I find myself here at the snot house

970
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,264
Little shoes, little socks

971
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,474
Please kill me. I'm serious, please kill me.

972
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,560
I'm not singing, I'm asking.

973
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,689
Locked in a cage with all the rats
I've slipped through the cracks

974
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:28,569
And now I'm stuck with the scraps
And I can't seem to find my way back

975
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,864
Get me out, get me out of here

976
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,073
Oh, get her out

977
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:36,410
I'm ready for stardom after all these years

978
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:40,372
I'm done with little girls

979
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:45,252
I wanna be someone in this world

980
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,463
Little girls, little girls

981
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,215
Everywhere I turn I can see them

982
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,721
Little girls, little girls

983
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,974
Night and day I eat, sleep and breathe them

984
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,226
Get out of here!

985
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,898
Locked in a cage with all the rats
I've slipped through the cracks

986
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:10,903
And now I'm stuck with the scraps
And I can't seem to find my way back

987
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,072
Oh, get me out, get me out of here

988
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,365
Oh, throw me a rope

989
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,535
I'm ready for stardom after all these years

990
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,456
I'm done with little girls

991
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:27,419
I wanna be someone in this world

992
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,796
Little girls, little girls

993
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,020
Oh, my God. That was beautiful.

994
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,314
Your voice matches your beauty.

995
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:52,528
You sound like a church bell,
if it was stuck on top of a beautiful woman,

996
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,696
or if a beautiful woman was inside a church bell.

997
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,199
Not that you look like a church bell.
That's not what I'm saying.

998
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,535
If you looked like a church bell,
I'd go to church every day.

999
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,619
What?

1000
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,956
I got you a T-shirt, and you're gonna love it.
Here, you ready? Here.

1001
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,672
What...

1002
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,510
It's not your color? Not your size.
I got more in the store.

1003
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,762
You know what I'm talking about, the church bell, right?

1004
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,651
Cannoli. One for your pretty friend.

1005
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,152
Thank you.

1006
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,905
- Sorry, kid.
- It's okay.

1007
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:43,495
Can you not tell Mr. Stacks about this?
I don't want to bother him with it.

1008
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,746
Sure.

1009
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,126
He's worked selflessly his entire life for New York.

1010
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,753
From his first job teaching in inner-city schools,

1011
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,755
to his 25 year stint on the City Council...

1012
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,008
- Whose voice is that?
- I don't know.

1013
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,052
Endorsed by The New York Times, the New York Post,

1014
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:02,055
and me, Michael J. Fox.

1015
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,933
Michael J. Fox? It's over. We're finished.

1016
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,269
If Michael J. Fox endorses him, then I'll vote for him.

1017
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,526
Listen to me, Michael J. Fox is
not as great a guy as you think.

1018
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,737
Oh, no, no. Come on, he's a saint.

1019
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,608
- I hear there's a tape.
- Forget it. I don't wanna hear it.

1020
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,109
- You've plateaued.
- Michael J. Fox.

1021
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,278
Pay attention. Follow the little green dot.

1022
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,739
- That's you there.
- I don't need a pointer to read a graph.

1023
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,950
Well, read this.
Annie's taken you as far as she can, okay?

1024
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,243
But it's not over.

1025
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,466
- How bad do you want this?
- I don't start things I can't win.

1026
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,997
Well, how far are you willing to go?

1027
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,375
Or should I say, how far do you want me to go?

1028
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:35,130
I pay you a lot of money for you
not to ask me those types of questions.

1029
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,340
Okay, Guy-O?

1030
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,718
Rat-a-tat-tat, message received, boss.

1031
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,507
- Good morning.
- Made you breakfast.

1032
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,176
You made me breakfast.

1033
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:27,099
Hey, I was thinking maybe you would wanna
go in to work with me today.

1034
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,017
- Cool.
- That'd be cool?

1035
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,519
- I'll go make us drinks.
- All right.

1036
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,688
Don't let your food get cold.

1037
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:36,817
Okay. I won't. This is amazing.

1038
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,988
Annie, you really outdid yourself.

1039
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,865
Annie, this is a triumph, honey.

1040
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,035
You got me eating this thing up like a dog.

1041
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,621
This is good. What is it?

1042
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,499
Paprika, oregano.

1043
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,836
What is... What is that, Gouda cheese?

1044
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,463
You wanna know what's Gouda?
This breakfast.

1045
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,971
Cool, a helicopter!

1046
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,307
Yeah.

1047
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,727
- Make sure you duck!
- Why?

1048
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,687
I don't know.
They always duck in the movies!

1049
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,899
Hop on up.

1050
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,571
All right. Here we go.

1051
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:23,905
Do you get airsick?

1052
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:28,493
Don't know. I've never been in the air before.
I threw up on the swings once.

1053
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:34,166
Annie, we're gonna do a cell tower check.
Make sure they're all working.

1054
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,876
You do that yourself?

1055
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,627
Yep, told you work was fun.

1056
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,421
Gilbert, let's roll.

1057
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,594
You'll be all right.

1058
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,683
You wanna know the secret to "Never drop a call"?

1059
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,101
Not really.

1060
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,438
Yes, yes, I do. Desperately.

1061
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:57,856
Good.

1062
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:02,068
See, we have five times as many cell towers
as the other guys.

1063
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,864
But we hide them in plain sight.
Like right there. You see?

1064
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,785
No.

1065
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,369
It's in her crown.

1066
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,373
Yeah!

1067
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,002
That's so cool.

1068
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,506
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1069
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:25,967
How'd you do this?
How'd you become king of the world?

1070
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,302
Well, I wouldn't say king of the world.

1071
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,553
But I work my butt off.

1072
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,389
The harder I work, the more opportunities I get.

1073
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,767
See, you gotta play the cards that you've been dealt,

1074
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,644
no matter how bad the cards are.

1075
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,938
What if you don't have any cards?

1076
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,523
Then you bluff.

1077
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:43,485
See, that's what I love about this city.
No matter who you are or what you are,

1078
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,822
you just gotta want it bad enough,
and work with what you got.

1079
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,705
This is just the start of your story

1080
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,542
If you got guts, you'll get glory

1081
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:02,504
Anyone can make their dreams come true

1082
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,214
In New York City

1083
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,092
And now's the time you gotta stand tough

1084
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,845
'Cause if you work hard, you can rise up

1085
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:13,974
Anyone can make it, even you

1086
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,684
In New York City

1087
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,436
Look at me, I'm just blood pumpin'

1088
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,189
You and me are two hearts thumpin'

1089
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:25,610
We are two souls feeling the same beat

1090
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:31,324
So take it all, the city's yours

1091
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:35,036
It's worth fighting for

1092
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,372
It's all yours

1093
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,375
So take it all

1094
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,878
The city's yours

1095
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,339
It's worth fighting for

1096
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,717
It's all mine

1097
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,970
It's all yours

1098
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,390
Why don't you go above 96th Street?

1099
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,850
No reason.

1100
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,688
Gilbert, go uptown.

1101
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,485
This is my New York City.

1102
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,446
Where'd you live?

1103
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,364
Everywhere.

1104
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,160
- I see a cell tower!
- Where?

1105
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,912
See it? Right there.

1106
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,164
Right under that devil bird.

1107
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,583
Good eyes.

1108
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:25,295
You know, Annie, sometimes what you're looking for

1109
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,840
is right in front of your face.

1110
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,467
In New York City

1111
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,846
- So take it all
- So take it all

1112
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,724
- The city's yours
- The city's mine

1113
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,936
- Worth fighting for
- It's worth fighting for

1114
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,438
- It's all mine
- It's all mine

1115
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,274
- So take it all
- So take it all

1116
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,235
- The city's yours
- The city's mine

1117
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,197
- Worth fighting for
- It's worth fighting for

1118
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,408
- It's all mine
- It's all mine

1119
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,494
It's all yours

1120
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,457
In New York City

1121
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,583
Grace.

1122
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,002
What's our presence past 96th Street?

1123
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,129
Well, we're mostly focused below,

1124
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,464
but I've been saying for a while we should try...

1125
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,299
No, but I had it this way.

1126
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,551
Let me do this. I've got it.

1127
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,136
I know what I'm doing.

1128
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,763
Miss Farrell?

1129
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,765
- It arrived. Thanks.
- What's that?

1130
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,309
I bought a dress for Annie to wear to the event tonight.

1131
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,145
It's gorgeous. I just need you to tie the bow
and make sure that the satin...

1132
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,313
- I tie the bow?
- Yeah.

1133
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,898
- I'm dressing her?
- You just have to tie the bow.

1134
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,317
No, I... What kind of bow?

1135
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,652
- It's just a simple bow.
- Like a slipknot?

1136
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,321
- 'Cause you know I didn't take Boy Scouts.
- It's very easy, Will.

1137
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,490
- And have the satin facing out.
- The satin?

1138
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:36,781
- Yeah.
- I knew a girl named Satin.

1139
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,743
I'm sure you did.
You don't need to elaborate.

1140
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,997
- Satin and bows is not necessarily my...
- You know what? I'll come over.

1141
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,082
- Yeah, I mean, either way.
- Great.

1142
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,959
She's gonna look gorgeous.

1143
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,171
Annie.

1144
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:34,007
You did not...

1145
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,718
- You didn't see anything?
- I didn't see anything.

1146
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:40,221
Good. Good. 'Cause I... Well, I don't know.
I thought I saw you...

1147
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,515
Nope! Here the whole time.

1148
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:45,143
What were you guys doing?
Just hanging out?

1149
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,563
- Hi.
- Evening.

1150
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:49,814
Wow.

1151
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,233
Grace, you look great.

1152
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,488
Please. You look handsome, lovely.

1153
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,614
- No.
- Yes.

1154
01:07:57,698 --> 01:08:00,700
This is old. This is my grandmother's.
It's nothing.

1155
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,035
Your grandmother is hot.

1156
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,704
I mean, not that I've...
I've never seen your grandmother. I'm not...

1157
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,081
I'm saying that the dress is nice.

1158
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,999
Well, you're sweet.

1159
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,502
You look good.

1160
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,961
So do you.

1161
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,048
Let's go and get you dressed. Let's go!

1162
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:17,675
Her dressed. I was already dressed.

1163
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,052
- Come on!
- Yes.

1164
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,346
- Come on.
- Yeah. Get some...

1165
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,857
- Ready?
- Yes. I'm very excited.

1166
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:41,950
Annie, it's gorgeous. You're just gorgeous.

1167
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,993
I can't believe it.

1168
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,789
All right, ladies, let's go. Let's go.
We're running late.

1169
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,874
Annie! Wow.

1170
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,585
I know, right? I've never seen a bow this big.

1171
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,130
Yes, and I noticed that you put the satin
on the outside of the bow.

1172
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,256
That's a very interesting choice.

1173
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,924
You know what? Get out of here.
We're not done yet.

1174
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,801
You know what?
When did this stop being my house?

1175
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,302
- Out!
- Okay, fine.

1176
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,221
You know what? You're changing everything.

1177
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,640
As a matter of fact, this used to be a Basquiat.

1178
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,809
Now it's a dog and a deer in a meadow.

1179
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:09,894
Why is that combination so cute?

1180
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,440
Come on. Let's do your hair.

1181
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,401
Why aren't you and Mr. Stacks together?

1182
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,320
That's a complicated question.

1183
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,157
Not really. Do you like him?

1184
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:26,327
Well, you know, I work for him. You know,
liking him doesn't really come into play.

1185
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,495
Okay.

1186
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,832
I mean, is he my friend? Yes.
Do I find him attractive? Sure.

1187
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:34,669
And not just in the physical sense.
But he is very good-looking.

1188
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,839
He's got lovely shoulders and a great, chiseled face.

1189
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,133
Lovely lips. Good hair.

1190
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,843
I wouldn't bank on the hair, sister.

1191
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:46,514
Well, I'm far too busy to be bothered
with anything like that anyway, so...

1192
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:49,017
That sounds like something Mr. Stacks would say.

1193
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:52,145
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1194
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:55,190
When my friend Pepper liked this boy
at school, she punched him in the face.

1195
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:59,027
She got suspended, but they play in the park together now.

1196
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,863
Sometimes I'd like to punch Mr. Stacks in the face.

1197
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:06,701
I'm just meaning punching. That's it.
I just want to punch him. He's annoying.

1198
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:17,337
Thanks for doing this, Will.
Your name's gonna look great up there.

1199
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:20,340
Now, you sure the Guggenheims are okay
with me taking their name off?

1200
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,258
You gave me 100 million reasons not to care.

1201
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,511
Did they find anything on my parents?

1202
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,556
No, not yet. And we dug real deep. I'm sorry.

1203
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,391
Thanks for trying.

1204
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,893
Annie!

1205
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:34,145
Annie, come on! Annie, Annie!

1206
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:38,524
New Yorkers face challenges every single day.

1207
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,985
Challenges that seem insurmountable.

1208
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:45,323
We all tell ourselves "no" a lot.
We say, "No, I won't get that job,"

1209
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,368
or, "No, I can't afford college."

1210
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:51,913
Unless it's you, Franklin, coming
from the mean streets of Martha's Vineyard.

1211
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,415
Hey! Yeah.

1212
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,211
Let's change those noes to yeses.

1213
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:03,007
Because when we say no,
we're actuallyjust scared to say yes.

1214
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:07,971
So, let's start saying yes to ourselves,
and let's say yes to a brighter future.

1215
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:14,560
Now, many of you know that
I've had a visitor staying with me recently.

1216
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,605
She only knows the word "yes." Annie?

1217
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,899
Could you come up, please?

1218
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,402
Go on. You'll be great. Go on, darling.

1219
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:24,570
Swallow your shrimp, Annie.

1220
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,076
Now, Annie, I don't wanna embarrass you.

1221
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,413
I just want everyone to see
what the future of our city is all about.

1222
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:34,956
Now, do you have anything you want to say

1223
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,584
to these good people
that are just oozing with liberal guilt?

1224
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,295
Except for you, Senator.

1225
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:43,047
I know you're trying to build that fence.

1226
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,761
I can't believe I'm here.

1227
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,639
I'm in a dress that feels like a cloud.

1228
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,475
I'm standing in the middle of a giant cinnamon roll.

1229
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:59,063
With a band that has little violins,

1230
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,733
big violins,

1231
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,360
one of those.

1232
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,071
A piano.

1233
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,325
Mr. Stacks has taught me so much.

1234
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:14,078
He's given me such a big opportunity.

1235
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:19,208
Under the glow of the very bright lights

1236
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:28,051
I turn my face towards the warm night skies

1237
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:35,767
And I am not afraid of a thousand eyes

1238
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:43,483
When they're above five hundred smiles

1239
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,695
Oh, I used to think

1240
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,697
Oh, she used to think

1241
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,699
What wouldn't I give

1242
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,451
What wouldn't she give

1243
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:57,372
For a moment like this

1244
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:01,751
This moment, this gift

1245
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,545
Now look at me

1246
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,173
And this opportunity

1247
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,884
Is standing right in front of me

1248
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:15,390
But one thing I know It's only part luck and so

1249
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:18,518
I'm putting on my best show

1250
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:23,356
Under the spotlight I'm starting my life

1251
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,359
Big dreams becoming real tonight

1252
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:31,406
So look at me and this opportunity

1253
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,325
You're witnessing my moment, you see?

1254
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:39,330
My big opportunity

1255
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,751
Oh, I used to think

1256
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,586
Oh, she used to think

1257
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,588
What I wouldn't give

1258
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,257
What wouldn't she give

1259
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:53,511
For a moment like this

1260
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:58,558
This moment, this gift

1261
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,268
And now look at me

1262
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:03,354
And this opportunity

1263
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,566
Is standing right in front of me

1264
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:11,279
But one thing I know It's only part luck and so

1265
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:14,866
I'm putting on my best show

1266
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:19,328
Under the spotlight I'm starting my life

1267
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:23,166
Big dreams becoming real tonight

1268
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,462
So look at me and this opportunity

1269
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,548
You're witnessing my moment, you see?

1270
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,052
My big opportunity

1271
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,139
I won't waste it

1272
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:41,601
I guarantee.

1273
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,440
Take a bow.

1274
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,069
That was great.

1275
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,821
- Now read my speech.
- What?

1276
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,241
That speech I wrote you. My speech.
It's right there.

1277
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,869
Is everything all right?

1278
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:01,871
I'll make it bigger for her.

1279
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,123
There it is. "Thank you, Mr. Stacks."

1280
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,541
- Hold on a second.
- No.

1281
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,001
Annie, is everything okay?

1282
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:10,588
Leave me alone.

1283
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:13,925
Annie! Annie!

1284
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,094
Annie?

1285
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:24,018
This is your big opportunity

1286
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:26,395
To vote for William Stacks

1287
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:29,315
Annie.

1288
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,863
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

1289
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,281
Annie!

1290
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,743
Hey! Wait, Annie. Slow down.
What are you doin'?

1291
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:43,079
- Annie.
- Wait, wait, wait. I got it.

1292
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,789
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

1293
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,958
Young lady, you're have to tell me
what's going on with you now!

1294
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,253
No, I don't! You're not my dad.

1295
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,630
Wow.

1296
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:58,719
Well, I know that. I know I'm not your dad.

1297
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,889
But I would like to know what's going on with you.

1298
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:06,852
I can't read.

1299
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:12,275
What do you mean you can't read?
I've watched you read, Annie.

1300
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,068
Maybe you were just nervous.

1301
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:16,279
Sorry I ruined your shrimp event.

1302
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,491
- What happened?
- I don't know. She freaked out.

1303
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,619
Hey, what were you two talking about earlier?

1304
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:26,914
She asked me to help her find her parents,
but it was a dead end.

1305
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:29,333
Even asked some of my old buddies on the force.

1306
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,668
There's nothing on that kid.

1307
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,044
Her parents.

1308
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,589
Genius.

1309
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:37,383
- Annie, what's wrong?
- Get back! Hey, hey, get back!

1310
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:38,843
- Grace!
- Get back!

1311
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:40,761
- Nash!
- Hey!

1312
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,930
- Make room!
- She's a kid. Get back. She's a kid.

1313
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,891
- Come on.
- Get back. She's a kid!

1314
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,654
Who is it?

1315
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,532
It's Guy Danlily. I work for Will Stacks.

1316
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:12,043
Come in.

1317
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:30,603
Hello there.

1318
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,105
Colleen Hannigan?

1319
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:34,482
That's my maiden name.

1320
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:38,027
But I'm not married to it, if you know what I mean.

1321
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,906
Can I buy you another drink?

1322
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:45,743
So, if he wins, I get paid a fortune.

1323
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,162
More than anything I've ever been paid combined.

1324
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:49,205
Why so much?

1325
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,624
It's like getting paid long odds on a dark horse.

1326
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:54,710
Do you know how hard it is to get Will Stacks elected?

1327
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,879
"Never drop a call."
What does that even mean?

1328
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,005
Everybody texts now.

1329
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,341
There have been worse politicians than him.

1330
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,385
I know. I got them elected.

1331
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:05,096
Schwarzenegger, Kim Jong-Il, that blood diamonds guy.

1332
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,098
- What?
- But I'm over it.

1333
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,935
I'm tired of being the cockroach
everybody needs, but treats like a...

1334
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,395
- Cockroach?
- Exactly.

1335
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,023
This is my last roll at the table.
Get paid and get out.

1336
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,943
There's no such thing as a way out. Trust me.

1337
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,028
There's always a way out. Trust me.

1338
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,907
And in this particular case,
it's all about finding Annie's parents.

1339
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:30,621
You know, I'm tired of being the black hat

1340
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,249
Of running the show down in the snake pit

1341
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,750
Are you singing to me?

1342
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:38,212
So this is our chance to get out of this place

1343
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:39,463
Is this really happening?

1344
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:44,260
So come on, let's run for it to

1345
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:45,092
Easy street

1346
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:57,022
Where you sleep till noon

1347
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:58,899
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1348
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:03,821
If Stacks reunites Annie with her parents,
80% surge in the polls for sure.

1349
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,366
We talked about this already.
They don't exist.

1350
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,701
We'll make them exist.

1351
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:11,537
Find a couple people to pretend to be her parents.

1352
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:12,830
They learn every detail

1353
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,624
and miraculously show up right before the election.

1354
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,126
Add water, instant parents.

1355
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,836
What's in it for me?

1356
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,838
Same as for me. Ka-ching.

1357
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,841
And no more being a cockroach.

1358
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,429
Yeah, I'll be the girl who's dripping in jewelry

1359
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,766
The crowds'll go wild when I sing

1360
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:36,437
I won't have to look out on a fire escape

1361
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:37,813
Two.

1362
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:40,775
The view will be billboards of me

1363
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:45,154
- On easy street
- On easy street

1364
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,325
- Easy street
- Easy street

1365
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:50,493
To a way out.

1366
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:54,705
- Where we all get paid
- Where we all get paid

1367
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,208
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

1368
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,296
- Move them feet to
- Move them feet to

1369
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:06,550
- Easy street
- Easy street

1370
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:14,635
- When you get there
- When you get there

1371
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:20,105
- Stay
- Stay

1372
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,273
I knew I liked you.

1373
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:27,530
Okay, we're not doing that right now.
That's fine. Yolo, yolo. That's fine.

1374
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,198
To easy street.

1375
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,047
I've been telling her she can do
anything she wants to do in this city,

1376
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,258
and come to find out she can't even read.

1377
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,219
How does that happen?

1378
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,472
A lot of kids get lost, Will.
A lot of people get lost.

1379
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:54,765
Well, it's unacceptable.

1380
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,767
We gotta get her a tutor.

1381
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:00,062
For her, though, right? Not just for the press.

1382
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:01,438
For her.

1383
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:04,900
What?

1384
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,903
I can feel you smiling
with those Britisher-than-thou lips.

1385
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:10,072
Your secret's safe with me, Batman.

1386
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,366
- What secret?
- That you care about her.

1387
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,035
I care about the kids that are in New York City.

1388
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,453
And Annie.

1389
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,874
Well, she lives in New York.

1390
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,585
So, therefore, she's cared for.

1391
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:26,589
It's a blanket...
She's within the structure of the whatever.

1392
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,435
Annie? Where you going?

1393
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:44,148
Thanks for everything.
Sorry I messed up last night.

1394
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,525
Hope you can still be mayor.

1395
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,485
What are you talking about? Get back here.

1396
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,364
It's okay. I'm good at this part.

1397
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:55,326
I've had a lot of practice getting kicked out of places.

1398
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,037
Annie.

1399
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,583
Listen, put your bag down.
You're not going anywhere.

1400
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,002
- Sandy's gotta go.
- Stop it.

1401
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,213
You and Sandy are staying here,
and I don't care what happened last night.

1402
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,883
No, I mean Sandy's gotta go.

1403
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,677
No, I mean... Sandy's gotta go. Okay.

1404
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,889
- Well, is it champagne or gelato?
- What?

1405
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:19,183
Is it Mountain Dew or is it just plain old doo?

1406
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:21,310
Is it lemonade or chicken nuggets?

1407
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:25,105
I should go.
Now I wanna go because my bladder's full.

1408
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,357
Come on, let's go.

1409
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,525
I saw you sign your name.

1410
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,611
That's all you gotta know how to do.

1411
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:33,238
But what about your teachers?
How is this possible?

1412
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,240
I'm good at hiding it.

1413
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:37,368
Okay, at home. They didn't catch it at home?

1414
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,286
"At home"?

1415
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:41,372
How come you didn't tell anybody about this?

1416
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:44,208
It's not like the whole world wants
a foster kid to begin with.

1417
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:47,795
And plus, it's embarrassing.
I didn't want anyone to know.

1418
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:53,092
You know what?

1419
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,011
I wanna show you something.

1420
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:04,436
This is good here.

1421
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,730
- Where are we?
- Queens.

1422
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,732
Do I need my passport?

1423
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,780
Truth is, Annie, everybody's got something
that they don't want anybody to know.

1424
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:16,615
Including me.

1425
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:19,868
For me, this is it.

1426
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,329
This is my family.

1427
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,915
Can you see them right now?

1428
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,918
No, I don't. I see them in my mind.

1429
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,920
Like this part of the track right here?

1430
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,840
This is where my father worked 20 hours a day.

1431
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:34,675
Work, and work, and work, and work.

1432
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,761
And then he died.

1433
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,264
I was 12 years old.

1434
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:41,932
What was he like?

1435
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,853
I don't know. I barely knew him.
He was always working.

1436
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,940
And that's why I felt like if I worked hard enough,

1437
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:52,568
then that'd probably bring me closer to him.

1438
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:57,698
And that's why I developed this.

1439
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,366
Well,

1440
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,787
now, you got this.

1441
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:14,631
Yeah, all right, Annie. You know, this pollen
or something's got my eyes all scratchy.

1442
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:18,052
Let's walk this way.
We can see where the trains go.

1443
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:25,976
It's so good to see you after all these years!

1444
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:31,106
Yo, suit. No cuts, no butts, no coconuts.
You gotta sign in.

1445
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:32,900
- For what?
- The auditions.

1446
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:34,109
Audition?

1447
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,737
Oh, my God!

1448
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:37,863
Wait!

1449
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,700
"We've been trying so hard to find you!"

1450
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:44,119
- Where is she?
- Back there. Why?

1451
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:45,287
Wait!

1452
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:47,372
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1453
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:48,582
Wait!

1454
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,085
That's an interesting choice.

1455
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:54,963
"Oh, darling girl!
It's so good to see you after all these years!"

1456
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:57,091
"We've been trying so hard to find you,

1457
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:01,386
"and then we saw pictures of you
with the nice man running for mayor."

1458
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:04,807
"Let's sing our special song only us three know."

1459
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:06,100
Locket!

1460
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,022
The sun will come out

1461
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,440
Pronto!

1462
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:17,027
- Bet your sweet bottom, fella, that
- Bet your sweet bottom, fella, that

1463
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,279
Pronto!

1464
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,074
There'II be sun!

1465
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,120
What the hell is this?

1466
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:27,329
A disaster.

1467
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,623
You're garbage. You're pitchy.

1468
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:30,791
- Next!
- Come on.

1469
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,751
- I really like the script.
- David Kramer says hello!

1470
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,378
- Out!
- That hack.

1471
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,380
What are you doing?

1472
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,966
You told me to find two people to play her parents.

1473
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:41,135
I meant some friends or some neighborhood toughs.

1474
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,678
Not open auditions.

1475
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:45,139
These are callbacks. I know, right?

1476
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:47,516
- And why are they singing?
- People love musicals.

1477
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,811
Bursting into song for no apparent reason. It's magical!

1478
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:52,396
There's a window There's a bed

1479
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,814
Here's a table There's your head

1480
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:55,023
Okay. You're done.

1481
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:58,569
I'll take care of finding the parents.
You don't do anything.

1482
01:25:58,653 --> 01:25:59,820
I'll call you when I need you.

1483
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:02,406
- But...
- No buts. We're running out of time.

1484
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:17,838
- Touch the sign!
- I did it!

1485
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,303
You ever see Casper the Friendly Ghost throw up?

1486
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:25,429
No.

1487
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:32,186
Would you like a marshmallow?

1488
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,105
Psych! How about a graham cracker?
You son of a...

1489
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:40,110
You make me laugh.

1490
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,999
Hey, Grace. Let me ask you something.

1491
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:00,839
Exactly how hard would it be to become a foster parent?

1492
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:03,634
And not temporarily either. More like a...

1493
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:07,387
Well, you know, permanent situation.

1494
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,556
You mean, adopt Annie?

1495
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,975
Yeah, well, whatever the word is.

1496
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:14,311
That's the word, Will.

1497
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,730
Then...

1498
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:19,733
Yeah.

1499
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,674
Sandy.

1500
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,301
We slept in the bed.

1501
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:49,429
Which one do you prefer, Will?

1502
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:51,723
Red.

1503
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:57,521
It's been two hours. I don't think
she's completely learned to read yet.

1504
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:58,981
Yeah, well, not completely, but...

1505
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:00,732
Will! Will!

1506
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:02,276
We got our game changer.

1507
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,820
Every election needs a game changer.
We got our game changer.

1508
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:06,822
- Stop saying "game changer."
- Annie's parents.

1509
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:09,449
They saw her picture, and they called us.
It's a miracle.

1510
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,620
"Game changer." Apparently,
they've been looking for her for years,

1511
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:14,830
but she's not in the system.

1512
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:16,623
How do they know she's their daughter?

1513
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,793
Well, they know everything about her.
They know about the locket, the note,

1514
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,296
and oh, yeah, I ran a DNA test.

1515
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:24,881
Boom goes the dynamite.

1516
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,262
DNA test.

1517
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:34,683
All right, but don't tell her.

1518
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:37,436
I wanna meet them before Annie finds out.

1519
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,934
I wouldn't have it any other way.
I mean, you should totally be the one

1520
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:42,024
who tells Annie that we found her parents!

1521
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:43,692
You found my parents?

1522
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:48,322
- Yes, honey, we did. Well, we think so.
- Really?

1523
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:51,199
Yeah. We're gonna meet them at a place called the Domani.

1524
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:52,629
- That's where the note is from!
- No way!

1525
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:53,660
I knew they'd come for me.

1526
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,918
I'm happy for you, Annie.
I know this is what you always wanted.

1527
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:03,337
And it's all because of you.

1528
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:15,223
I can't believe I'm gonna see my parents.
I'm kind of freaking out.

1529
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:23,440
Annie! Annie! Over here!

1530
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,067
Are you happy? Are you happy?

1531
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:28,862
- Very happy for you.
- Thanks.

1532
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:31,114
Annie, The Reunion.

1533
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,577
- Annie.
- My girl.

1534
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,956
Is it a match? Let's see, huh?

1535
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,586
It's a match.

1536
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,881
- We thought we'd lost you forever.
- Me, too.

1537
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:49,383
We fell upon hard times.

1538
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,502
We just felt it was best
for someone else to look after you.

1539
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:52,552
I figured.

1540
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:54,304
I've never forgiven myself for it.

1541
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,682
But when we got back on our feet,
well, we just couldn't find you, kid.

1542
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,143
But the angels were looking out.

1543
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,229
- Where do you live?
- New Jersey.

1544
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,316
But we're moving to Brazil for my job.

1545
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:08,693
- I think you're gonna like it there.
- Cool.

1546
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:10,237
Okay, let's get started.

1547
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,030
Everything is in order.

1548
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:15,909
We have the DNA test signed by the judge.

1549
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:18,578
Now, we just need signatures of the parents.

1550
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,497
- That's you guys.
- That's us.

1551
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:24,668
Ma'am, sign right there.

1552
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,379
Hey. Remember me from before?

1553
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:29,423
- You know what, I do.
- That's right.

1554
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,633
I didn't know that you were Annie's foster mom.

1555
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:33,510
- Amongst other things.
- I know.

1556
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:34,974
She said that you're a very good singer.

1557
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,473
What'd she say? "She's a really good singer."

1558
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:42,185
No, she didn't do any of that. She just said
you have a very nice voice, and she liked it.

1559
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,688
- She did?
- Yep.

1560
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:48,567
Said it made her feel good about herself.

1561
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:50,902
Thank you, Rodney.

1562
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,238
The guardian of record.

1563
01:30:53,322 --> 01:30:55,866
That's you, stretch. Come on. Right here.

1564
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,202
You sure about this?

1565
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,246
That this is gonna win you the election?
Yeah.

1566
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,790
No. Annie.

1567
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:06,001
You don't pay me to worry about her.

1568
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:11,173
And the current temporary guardian, William Stacks.

1569
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,925
Mr. Stacks, we meet again.

1570
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,803
That is a very big pen.

1571
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:20,056
Thank you.

1572
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:23,685
Okay. Well, according to the State of New York,

1573
01:31:23,936 --> 01:31:27,189
you are officially reunited.

1574
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:28,648
- Yay!
- Great!

1575
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,569
- We'll pick you up at 4:00.
- Great.

1576
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,656
All right.

1577
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,825
What were they like?

1578
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,076
Hey! Wait!

1579
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,912
How did you do the DNA test?

1580
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:43,997
You can do anything with money.

1581
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:46,958
Well, who are those people,
and what's your plan with her, anyhow?

1582
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:49,294
Don't worry about it. She served her purpose.

1583
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:50,504
What does that mean?

1584
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,214
That they'll hold her for a while

1585
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,591
then dump her back in the system till after the election.

1586
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:56,051
No harm, no foul.

1587
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:58,178
You can't do that to her.
I mean, she's still a little girl.

1588
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:01,181
What do you care? Look, just go home
and keep your mouth shut.

1589
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,642
Hey! You can't talk to me like that.

1590
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,435
I know things about you.

1591
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,565
Well, if you know what's good for you,
you'll go home, and keep your mouth shut.

1592
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,319
Mr. Stacks! Has it helped you in the polls?

1593
01:32:14,403 --> 01:32:18,532
Hey, folks, Mr. Stacks is thrilled
for Annie and her family.

1594
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:21,785
Never drop a citizen. Vote Stacks for mayor.

1595
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:25,580
Annie! Annie! Did you enjoy seeing them?
How was it?

1596
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,766
- We're gonna miss you, Annie.
- Yeah.

1597
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:49,187
We can finally get those bubbles out of the apartment.

1598
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:53,358
Yeah.

1599
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:04,703
Warm enough?

1600
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:06,913
Yeah. Are you?

1601
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:10,375
Yeah.

1602
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,170
Is it dusty in here?

1603
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,089
Nah.

1604
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:19,593
The New York Post reports Will Stacks
reuniting Annie with her parents

1605
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:22,387
has pushed him into a dead heat in the race for mayor.

1606
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:25,223
He was once trailing by as much as 30 points.

1607
01:33:26,225 --> 01:33:29,019
Hey, baby.
So, I haven't seen you in here for a minute.

1608
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,313
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- Take it easy.

1609
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:33,523
How you doing?

1610
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,483
Not super awesome.

1611
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:37,861
You want me to make you a sandwich?

1612
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:39,696
How about if I make you a key?

1613
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:45,994
You ever do anything that you thought
was really a good idea at the time,

1614
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:48,204
but then after, it's like you're not so sure.

1615
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,873
Yeah. Putting up that key sign.

1616
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:52,042
I don't know the first thing about making keys.

1617
01:33:53,377 --> 01:33:55,211
What's the matter, sweetie?
What did you do?

1618
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:57,589
'Cause, whatever it is, you know I'm here to help.

1619
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:01,593
Why are you so nice to me, the way I treat you?

1620
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:06,765
Because under all that bitter,
there's a sweet lady with a big heart.

1621
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:10,268
She's just been gone for a while. That's all.

1622
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:14,773
Yeah.

1623
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:27,285
Who am I, and what have I become?

1624
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:32,332
Do I stand for something or for money?

1625
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:38,922
Who am I, and where's my good girl gone?

1626
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:43,843
You know I had a good heart once, you see

1627
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:50,892
Who am I now that my armor's gone?

1628
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:56,981
You gave me what I didn't know I needed

1629
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:03,029
Who am I now that my heart is won?

1630
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:08,993
I didn't know I needed anyone

1631
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:12,163
- But I've got today
- But I've got today

1632
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:15,417
- I gotta make
- I gotta make

1633
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:20,880
- The best I can of it
- The best I can of it

1634
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:27,387
- 'Cause yesterday is dead and gone
- 'Cause yesterday is dead and gone

1635
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:32,684
- And me along with it
- And me along with it

1636
01:35:32,768 --> 01:35:35,645
- I want to start again
- I want to start again

1637
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:39,232
- So I look within
- So I look within

1638
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:44,904
- Remember what I wanted
- Remember what I wanted

1639
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:47,741
- 'Cause I don't know
- 'Cause I don't know

1640
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:51,411
- Who I've become
- Who I've become

1641
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,706
- But I will trust in it
- But I will trust in it

1642
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,917
- Yeah, I will trust in it
- Yeah, I will trust in it

1643
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:03,381
Who am I? I spent my life alone

1644
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:08,470
Forever looking for some place to call home

1645
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:15,310
Who am I? About to meet myself

1646
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:19,981
This should feel right, but something don't

1647
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:23,985
I want to start again

1648
01:36:24,069 --> 01:36:27,530
So I look within

1649
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:32,619
Remember what I wanted

1650
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:39,751
'Cause I don't know who I've become

1651
01:36:39,835 --> 01:36:42,921
But I will trust in it

1652
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:51,005
I will trust in it

1653
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:02,524
But today I gotta make

1654
01:37:04,109 --> 01:37:07,111
The best I can of it

1655
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:15,245
'Cause yesterday is dead and gone

1656
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:18,915
And me along with it

1657
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:22,877
I wanna start again.

1658
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:35,515
Cinderella dressed in yellow

1659
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:37,767
Went upstairs to kiss her fella

1660
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,395
Made a mistake and kissed a snake How many doctors...

1661
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:43,773
Guys, I need your help.

1662
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:50,864
- Hey.
- Hey.

1663
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:56,244
Gotta give this back to you.
It won't work in Brazil.

1664
01:37:56,328 --> 01:38:00,540
Yeah, we're not in Brazil yet.
We're in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia...

1665
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:03,585
Actually, southern Colombia. Now, Bogota,
that's a tough place to penetrate.

1666
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:05,712
Yeah, I've heard that about Bogota.

1667
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:11,175
- Made you something.
- Really?

1668
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,933
That's me, that's Sandy, and that's you.

1669
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:21,352
I copied "Stacks" from my phone.

1670
01:38:25,608 --> 01:38:27,483
I'm gonna miss you.

1671
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:36,200
- Annie.
- Hi.

1672
01:38:36,285 --> 01:38:38,285
- You ready?
- We're gonna go straight to the airport, kid.

1673
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:39,370
Okay.

1674
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:44,000
It's been great getting to know you, Annie.
You're such a special little girl.

1675
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:50,173
You should punch Mr. Stacks in the face
so you can go play in the park together.

1676
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,800
Then you'll have a real friend.

1677
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:55,637
- That was between us! Okay?
- Okay.

1678
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,180
I'd like to help you out.

1679
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:01,809
No, thank you. We don't believe in handouts.

1680
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:04,187
Only hand ups.
And you've already given us one.

1681
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:09,651
Bye, Annie.

1682
01:39:12,154 --> 01:39:14,781
- Never slow your roll.
- You neither.

1683
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,204
What a cute dog.

1684
01:39:22,706 --> 01:39:24,499
- Come on.
- Bye.

1685
01:39:26,168 --> 01:39:27,293
Bye.

1686
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:34,592
Goodbye, Annie.

1687
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:37,887
The press is eating this up.
We're gonna crush.

1688
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:42,600
Goodbye, Harold Gray, you pathetic, nonprofit do-gooder.

1689
01:39:47,856 --> 01:39:49,440
Grace, where are we with that phone battery?

1690
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:50,483
What?

1691
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:52,944
A full week on one charge, where are we with that?

1692
01:39:53,028 --> 01:39:54,946
- We're close.
- Close is not good enough.

1693
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:58,199
- Well, we don't have the...
- We've already wasted enough time.

1694
01:39:58,283 --> 01:40:01,077
I'm gonna go call the research department.

1695
01:40:09,294 --> 01:40:10,586
Knock them dead, kid.

1696
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:14,924
Bye, Annie!

1697
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:31,566
- Will? I hate seeing you like this.
- Grace, I'm fine. Let's just...

1698
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:33,693
Mr. Stacks, I think you're gonna wanna hear this.

1699
01:40:33,777 --> 01:40:34,902
Annie's in trouble.

1700
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:36,779
- What?
- Those weren't her real parents.

1701
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:39,866
- What? What is happening?
- Ignore her, 'cause she's clearly insane.

1702
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,451
Watch your mouth, chango.

1703
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:44,328
Look, I did something terrible, and I'm really sorry.

1704
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:46,122
What do you mean those aren't her real parents?

1705
01:40:46,498 --> 01:40:49,042
He had them take her somewhere.

1706
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:51,419
- I can't believe I danced with you!
- You danced with him?

1707
01:40:51,503 --> 01:40:53,296
I was desperate. He was a little handsy.

1708
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,506
- Where is Annie?
- What have you done?

1709
01:40:55,591 --> 01:40:56,924
Where's Annie?

1710
01:40:57,634 --> 01:40:59,302
Is it cold in Brazil?

1711
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:03,473
- Just be cool.
- She's asking questions.

1712
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:07,977
- Do you collect ashtrays?
- No.

1713
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:10,646
- Art?
- No.

1714
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:13,107
- Do you play piano?
- Just shut up.

1715
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,233
Where are we going?

1716
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,945
We're just taking you someplace
for a little bit. Just relax.

1717
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,614
You're not my real parents, are you?

1718
01:41:22,284 --> 01:41:24,410
- Sit back. Sit still.
- What are you doing? Stop that.

1719
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:26,996
Let me go!
When Mr. Stacks finds out about this...

1720
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:30,083
Stacks doesn't need you anymore.
Why do you think we're taking you?

1721
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:35,421
You work for Mr. Stacks?
He wouldn't do this.

1722
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:39,008
Yeah, well, I guess he has enough photos.

1723
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:44,764
Mr. Stacks did this?

1724
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:53,940
Call my guy at the FBI.
I want to get everyone on it.

1725
01:41:54,024 --> 01:41:54,982
I got it.

1726
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:56,400
I'm already on with the police.

1727
01:41:56,485 --> 01:41:57,693
I didn't think anything like this could happen.

1728
01:41:57,778 --> 01:41:59,403
How could you not know who has her?

1729
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:01,614
I got a guy who takes care of these kinds of things.

1730
01:42:01,698 --> 01:42:03,074
It keeps our hands clean. Trust me.

1731
01:42:03,158 --> 01:42:05,034
I can't trust you. You took Annie.

1732
01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:23,052
Hey!

1733
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:24,595
Hey, look!

1734
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,347
It's me! Annie!

1735
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:28,683
- Hey, girl!
- Help!

1736
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:29,976
Get her. Grab her.

1737
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,311
- Sit, sit, sit still.
- Don't touch me!

1738
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:33,479
Sit still!

1739
01:42:38,193 --> 01:42:39,652
Everybody, listen up.

1740
01:42:39,736 --> 01:42:42,697
- Check every call within a 10-mile radius.
- On it.

1741
01:42:42,781 --> 01:42:44,073
I knew they could do that!

1742
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:46,075
Someone just posted a picture ofAnnie on Twitter.

1743
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:48,077
- Where?
- 54th and 6th.

1744
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,496
Another one on an Annie blog.
It looks like she's waving.

1745
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:52,039
- 57th and 6th.
- Let's go.

1746
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,960
Hey. You do this, and everyone will know.

1747
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:58,713
Forget about being mayor.
It'll destroy your whole business!

1748
01:42:58,797 --> 01:42:59,922
I don't care.

1749
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:03,217
You're making a huge mistake.
Think about everything you've worked for.

1750
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:04,635
That everything means nothing.

1751
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,387
You're fired.

1752
01:43:06,471 --> 01:43:08,014
You! Talk to him.

1753
01:43:08,765 --> 01:43:10,433
You're the only one he'll listen to.

1754
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,812
It's not 'cause she likes you.

1755
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:17,648
She's got these pointy little...

1756
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:23,529
Nice chopper! What is this, a Bell 429?

1757
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:24,697
What?

1758
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:27,033
What, a guy like me can't know about helicopters?

1759
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:29,827
I don't know anything about helicopters!
It's written right here.

1760
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:32,205
- Gilbert, let's go.
- Roger that.

1761
01:43:32,289 --> 01:43:33,581
- Who's Roger?
- Who's Roger?

1762
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:40,129
Is anyone else dizzy?

1763
01:43:43,592 --> 01:43:45,718
- Look! It's Annie!
- Help.

1764
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,929
Another picture on lnstagram. 65th and 10th.

1765
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:49,222
Head west, Gil.

1766
01:43:57,648 --> 01:43:59,523
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey!

1767
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:00,608
Hold her still.

1768
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:07,490
We'll find her, Will.

1769
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:10,427
Just posted on the George Washington Bridge.

1770
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:13,412
She's waving. She's doing it on purpose!

1771
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:14,580
Head uptown, Gil.

1772
01:44:24,341 --> 01:44:25,967
There she is!

1773
01:44:26,843 --> 01:44:28,261
Don't lose them.

1774
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:35,643
On an Annie blog!
She's heading to the State Park.

1775
01:44:35,727 --> 01:44:36,978
They're headed into the park.

1776
01:44:37,062 --> 01:44:39,230
Gilbert, don't make me come up there
and fly this helicopter.

1777
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,402
There they are!

1778
01:44:44,486 --> 01:44:46,320
- Annie! Annie!
- Annie!

1779
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:47,905
I don't think she can hear you.

1780
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:58,082
What? It's the cops.

1781
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:10,678
Oh, no. It's Stacks.

1782
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,763
Why would he be following us?

1783
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:22,315
- Watch it!
- Whoa!

1784
01:45:23,191 --> 01:45:24,400
Watch out!

1785
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:29,864
- Annie!
- Annie.

1786
01:45:37,956 --> 01:45:39,457
- Gil, let's land this!
- Cut them off.

1787
01:45:41,793 --> 01:45:44,045
I really hope we find Annie soon.

1788
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:47,131
No!

1789
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:50,259
Annie!

1790
01:45:50,927 --> 01:45:52,011
Get them!

1791
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:53,721
NYPD, hold it!

1792
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,266
Annie!

1793
01:45:57,726 --> 01:46:00,686
- Annie, are you okay?
- I'm fine. We even now?

1794
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,480
- What?
- Want another photo?

1795
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:07,902
- It's not like that, honey.
- It's exactly like that.

1796
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:10,529
You don't care about me.
I was just an opportunity to you.

1797
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:12,114
- No, that's not true.
- It is true.

1798
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:14,784
You did all this to me so you could be stupid mayor!

1799
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:18,371
- No... Listen, you gotta trust me!
- I can't trust you. I can't trust anybody!

1800
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,956
- No!
- Just let me go!

1801
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:23,834
Listen, I'm sorry for what happened to you.

1802
01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:25,044
I can't look you in the eye

1803
01:46:25,128 --> 01:46:26,921
and tell you that I didn't know
that something was going on.

1804
01:46:27,005 --> 01:46:30,132
But I did not know that those people weren't your parents.

1805
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,675
You gotta believe me.

1806
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:36,680
This is you, Annie.

1807
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,143
It's you.

1808
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:46,315
Wait, wait.

1809
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,483
Sir! Sir.

1810
01:46:47,567 --> 01:46:50,319
I officially withdraw from this mayoral race.

1811
01:46:51,863 --> 01:46:55,658
I think that this city deserves someone better than I am.

1812
01:46:55,992 --> 01:46:59,745
I wanna take time out to concentrate
on things that really matter to me the most,

1813
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,539
and that's this amazing little girl, Annie.

1814
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,376
Because...

1815
01:47:09,548 --> 01:47:11,340
It's kind of dusty.

1816
01:47:15,303 --> 01:47:17,555
No, it's not dusty.

1817
01:47:17,639 --> 01:47:19,098
I'm crying.

1818
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:22,393
That's my family.

1819
01:47:23,145 --> 01:47:24,228
Thank you.

1820
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:40,411
I need one more thing from you.

1821
01:47:41,413 --> 01:47:44,999
You are always on the hustle.
What is it now?

1822
01:47:46,084 --> 01:47:48,002
Stop playing games.

1823
01:47:52,924 --> 01:47:54,383
Oh, yeah, I got this.

1824
01:47:55,969 --> 01:47:58,637
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1825
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:03,142
Grace, listen, I've always had a problem
with realizing what's right in front of me,

1826
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:07,062
and, well, I'm learning.

1827
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:08,647
Would you like to go out to dinner with me?

1828
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:10,816
What?

1829
01:48:12,152 --> 01:48:14,820
I mean, without you, I can't function.

1830
01:48:14,905 --> 01:48:16,864
That just doesn't mean work either.

1831
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:18,991
You're right about everything.

1832
01:48:19,075 --> 01:48:20,618
You're right about the phone, you're right about Guy,

1833
01:48:20,702 --> 01:48:22,786
you're right about this mayoral race,
right about the wind...

1834
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:23,871
Shut up!

1835
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:44,475
Together at last!

1836
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:46,810
Together forever!

1837
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:49,146
We're tying a knot

1838
01:48:49,731 --> 01:48:51,732
They never can sever!

1839
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:56,111
I don't need sunshine now To turn my skies to blue

1840
01:48:57,113 --> 01:49:01,075
I don't need anything but you!

1841
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:03,953
You've wrapped me around

1842
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:06,455
That cute little finger

1843
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:08,916
You've made life a song

1844
01:49:09,292 --> 01:49:11,544
You made me a singer!

1845
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:13,629
You're not warm and fuzzy

1846
01:49:14,297 --> 01:49:16,257
And ain't the most shyest girl

1847
01:49:16,633 --> 01:49:18,884
- But nothing on Earth
- But nothing on Earth

1848
01:49:18,969 --> 01:49:23,764
- Could ever divide us!
- Could ever divide us!

1849
01:49:23,848 --> 01:49:25,099
Today was terrible.

1850
01:49:25,183 --> 01:49:26,725
Today was a straight-up nightmare.

1851
01:49:27,143 --> 01:49:28,602
- But that was then
- But that was then

1852
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:31,230
- 'Cause I was looking for something
- 'Cause I was looking for something

1853
01:49:31,314 --> 01:49:33,482
- Looking for my loose end
- Looking for my loose end

1854
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:36,610
- Now I don't need anything but you
- Now I don't need anything but you

1855
01:49:36,695 --> 01:49:38,070
- But that was then
- But that was then

1856
01:49:38,446 --> 01:49:40,948
- I was looking for something
- I was looking for something

1857
01:49:41,032 --> 01:49:42,992
- Looking for my loose end
- Looking for my loose end

1858
01:49:43,326 --> 01:49:47,246
- Now I don't need anything but you

1859
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,915
- But nothing on Earth
- But nothing on Earth

1860
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,126
- Could ever divide us!
- Could ever divide us!

1861
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,628
- But nothing on Earth
- But nothing on Earth

1862
01:49:54,713 --> 01:49:57,590
- Could ever divide us!
- Could ever divide us!

1863
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:59,425
- But nothing on Earth

1864
01:49:59,509 --> 01:50:01,594
- Could ever divide us!

1865
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:04,179
- But nothing on Earth

1866
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:06,348
- Could ever divide us!
- Could ever divide us!

1867
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,520
Yeah, all right.

1868
01:50:21,114 --> 01:50:23,407
Everybody dance now

1869
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:25,993
No, no. It's their thing, mami.

1870
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:28,495
Together at last!

1871
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,664
Together forever!

1872
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:33,500
We're tying a knot

1873
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:35,586
- They never can sever!
- They never can sever!

1874
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,005
You're two of a kind

1875
01:50:38,089 --> 01:50:40,758
The happiest pair now

1876
01:50:40,842 --> 01:50:43,218
Like bright shooting stars

1877
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,220
You're floating on air now

1878
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:50,726
And what's the title of the dream that just came true?

1879
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:54,647
I don't need anything

1880
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:56,899
- Anything
- Anything

1881
01:50:57,859 --> 01:51:01,528
I don't need anything but you

1882
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:05,491
Keeps singing and dancing like that,
there's no way he was ever gonna win.

1883
01:51:06,618 --> 01:51:10,079
"The city is full of opportunity.
It's yours to take.

1884
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:12,748
"The sun will come out tomorrow."

1885
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:19,171
The sun'II come out tomorrow

1886
01:51:19,255 --> 01:51:23,342
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

1887
01:51:23,426 --> 01:51:25,636
There'II be sun

1888
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:29,973
Just thinkin' about tomorrow

1889
01:51:30,058 --> 01:51:34,353
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow

1890
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:36,605
'Til there's none

1891
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,649
When I'm stuck with a day

1892
01:51:38,733 --> 01:51:42,111
That's gray, and lonely

1893
01:51:42,195 --> 01:51:45,489
I just stick out my chin and grin

1894
01:51:45,573 --> 01:51:48,242
And say

1895
01:51:48,326 --> 01:51:51,704
The sun'II come out tomorrow

1896
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:55,624
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

1897
01:51:56,042 --> 01:51:58,502
Come what may

1898
01:51:58,586 --> 01:52:01,630
- Tomorrow, tomorrow!
- But nothing on Earth

1899
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:04,967
- I love you, tomorrow!
- Could ever divide us

1900
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:07,678
- You're always a day away!
- But nothing on Earth

1901
01:52:07,762 --> 01:52:10,723
- Could ever divide us
- Tomorrow!

1902
01:52:10,807 --> 01:52:12,641
- But nothing on Earth
- Tomorrow!

1903
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:15,144
- Could ever divide us
- I love you, tomorrow

1904
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:20,691
You're always a day

1905
01:52:20,942 --> 01:52:21,442
Away!

1906
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:30,451
To-To-To-To-Tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a day away!

1907
01:52:30,618 --> 01:52:31,869
Yeah!

1908
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,290
You do you, Saffron!

1909
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,502
That's what I'm talking about.
