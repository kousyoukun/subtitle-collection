You know, people come
for the bathroom,

340

but they stay for the bedroom.

341

to study?

This is terrible.

Do you really think
a businessman can run the city?

386
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,416
At Stacks Mobile, I made a cell
network that never drops a call.

387
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,085
As mayor, I'm gonna
make a government

that never drops a citizen.

389

Yeah, as long as those citizens
live below 96th Street.

I change these to?

Uh, Sixteen percent better
if you give them a single.

Thirty-eight percent if you
shoot them the double.

399
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,342
Why do I get the feeling
like I'm wasting my time here?

400

Am I gonna win, or not?

'Cause this seems
like a waste of time.

You're gonna win.

already dressed.

relate to regular people.

00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,858
And Clean Water,
but you can't have

641
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,860
whales without water. (GROANS)

642
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,780
Gosh. You know what? Just make it
out to "cash." I'll divvy it up.

643
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,283
Perfect. Annie!

644
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,784
You know, she's such an angel.

645
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,035
We don't inherit the Earth,

646
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,537
we borrow it from our children.

647
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,830
It's a lovely sentiment.

648
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,331
Oh! There she is.

649
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,541
Hi, Annie. I'm Grace.

650
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,878
I work for Mr. Stacks, the gentleman
that you ran into yesterday.

651
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,170
He'd like to invite
you to lunch.

652
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,172
I promise we won't
keep you long.

653
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,008
You can keep me
as long as you want.

654
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,728
No way! Is this for real?

655
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,147
This car's as big as a subway!
You're so lucky!

656
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,315
It's incredible.

657
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,066
Oh, my gosh. I want that!

658
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,318
Oh, my gosh!

659
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,236
Help yourself
to whatever you want.

660
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,571
No way. Really?

661
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,822
Sure.

662
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,908
Give me this! Give me this!
I want this!

663
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,075
Oh, my God!

664
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,535
I want that one! I want that!

665
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,953
This is crazy! My God!

666
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,247
Kids love candy, huh?

667
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,498
(GASPING)

668
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,959
Hey, Annie! Maybe
I should come with you

669
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,379
and make sure that everything's USDA
Grade A awesome, huh?

670
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,464
I'm good. Thanks.

671
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,840
Bye, Annie!

672
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,550
Bye! Later.

673
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,010
Thanks! Oh, my gosh.

674
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,929
Hey, gorgeous!

675
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,805
How does it feel
to have a famous kid?

676
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,932
What are you talking about?

677
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,850
It's Annie!

678
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,143
Your Annie!

679
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:23,065
Hey, you wanna go out tonight?
I got my dance pants on.

680
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,150
I haven't hit
that rock bottom yet.

681
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,069
I love it when you
throw me shade!

682
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,111
(SCOFFS)

683
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,030
Here, Lou. It's okay.
She likes me.

684
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,826
Oh, my God, this is so good.

685
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,621
Mr. Stacks would like to take some pictures
with you, if that's all right.

686
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,456
I guess so. Why?

687
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,291
People wanna know
that you're okay.

688
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,417
What people?

689
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,543
Everybody who saw that.

690
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,131
Whoa, my hair's gigantic.

691
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,550
We can listen
to whatever you like.

692
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,052
Can you put on talk radio?

693
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,221
Are you sure you don't
wanna listen to music?

694
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,182
I love talk radio. It calms me.

695
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,143
So do I. I loved it when
I was a little girl.

696
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,780
I used to think that they were
all my friends.

697
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,813
(CHUCKLES)

698
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,316
Sorry, that sounded very sad.

699
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,918
(LAUGHS)
Sorry.

700
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,070
I have a lot of friends,
so don't worry about me.

701
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,573
I mean, so I work a lot. I do. And
I could have some more friends.

702
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,617
But how many friends
do you really need?

703
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,328
I mean, if you were
my parents asking me,

704
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,706
"Are you fulfilled
and are you happy, Grace?"

705
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,207
That's a whole different
conversation, right?

706
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,417
But we're not having
that conversation.

707
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,087
And, frankly, it's really not your position
to ask me that at all. So...

708
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,672
Okay.

709
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,474
There she is. Our own
Little Orphan Annie.

710
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,437
Foster kid.

711
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,778
She's here.

712
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:57,284
Hey, this is the one, right?
All right. Let's get this.

713
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,162
Slow your roll.

714
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,789
Excuse me? Can we eat first?
It was a long drive.

715
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,000
(WHISPERING)
Yeah, yeah. Go, go.

716
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:09,087
Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's eat.
We got time for that.

717
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,338
All right.

718
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,426
So, how are you feeling
from yesterday?

719
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,345
So, what's the hustle?

720
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,806
What makes you think there's a hustle?
There's no hustle.

721
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,974
Come on, come on. Uh...

722
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,187
I'm 10. I'm not an idiot.

723
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,022
I never said you were...

724
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,232
An idiot. Or 10.

725
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,652
Truth of the matter is,
I don't know how old you are.

726
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,572
Ten. Well, now we know
that you're not an idiot.

727
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,312
But there are a lot of people
out there that are

728
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,742
and when they saw
that photo of us,

729
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,378
they thought that I would make
a great mayor.

730
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,870
Why?

731
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,538
Why? Because I'm a...

732
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,749
I'm a rich guy.
I saved an orphan.

733
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,585
I'm not an orphan,
I'm a foster kid.

734
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,878
And you didn't save me.

735
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,254
Oh, I didn't save you?
I didn't just

736
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,547
push you out of the way
of a Van?

737
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,924
Why don't I call that Van
back and have him

738
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,491
finish up what he...

You know what?

740
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,013
The more we're seen together,
the better it is for my campaign.

741
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,057
Wait. That's how a mayor
gets elected?

742
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,100
Yes. Insane, isn't it?

743
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,602
I bet if I moved in with you,
you'd become president.

(COUGHING)
Move in with me?

745
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,525
This is not that kind of party.

746
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,984
That's it. That's it. That's it.

crowded where you live.

that you might like?

Listen to me. It'll only be
for a few weeks.

Then she'll go back
to wherever she came from.

15 point jump in the polls.

Guaranteed. You want
me to play Daddy?

It's easy. All I need
is a bed and meals.

You don't have to do
anything else.

an extra $157 a week.

about doing this?

You want photos, right?

770
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,288
I'm sure there's easier
ways to get photos.

Are you really doing this?

00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,297
Yeah, won't even know
she's there.

776
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,673
It's like having a turtle.

777
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,008
I wonder if she has her shots.

778

How was your lunch?
What's your name?

779
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,637
Her name is Annie, and she'll be
staying with Mr. Stacks for awhile.

00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,014
He's going to adopt you?

781
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,474
No, no, no. I have parents.

782
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,436
This is just temporary.
If he gets approved.

a liking to young Annie.

00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,560
I'm surprised he hasn't
gotten a dog yet.

956
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,486
Are you sure I can have one?

957
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,196
No. Yes.

958
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,948
GUY: Look, kids love dogs.

959
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,450
Come on, they see them on the street
and they all go, "Aw."

960
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,285
Am I right? Hello.

961
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,543
You know, women do
the same thing.

962
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,996
Hello. (BARKS TWICE)

963
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,081
Hello.

965
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,752
What about that one?

966
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,464
She was separated from her pack too early.
She just needs a little love.

967
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,218
Don't pick that one,
it's licking its own hoo-hah.

968
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,886
Hey, girl, we found each other.

969
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,556
I'll never leave you
again, I promise.

970
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,391
FEMALE REPORTER: Annie,
what are you gonna name it?

971
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,642
She's like a hurricane.

972
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,769
Sandy. Her
name's gonna be Sandy.

973
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,526
I told you. Ow!

974
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,819
Annie, will you take
a picture with us?

975
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,070
Um, sure.

976
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,449
Thanks, Annie.

977
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,287
She really likes you.

978

(SANDY PANTING)

979
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,198
Look.

980
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,836
Hey.

981
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,464
Something wrong?

982
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,759
Couldn't sleep.
So quiet up here.

983
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,844
What you doing? I'm working.

984
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:47,929
This late?

985
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,430
Always.

986
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,848
When do you have fun?

987
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,183
This is fun.

988
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,559
I haven't been to Disneyland,

989
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,978
but I don't think they have
a paperwork ride.

990
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,648
Look, if you're hungry, there's not
a lot of food here. Only takeout.

991
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,982

992
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,943
Cool.

Knock yourself out.

994
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,781
You don't have a cook? Or
like a million servants?

995
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,324
Nope, I don't.
I like to be alone.

996
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,159
So why do you need
all this space?

997
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,746
'Cause I like to be alone
with a lot of space.

998
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,668
Look, I think people surround
themselves with other people

999
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,211
just so they can feel loved.
I don't believe in that.

1000
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,838
I believe the people
that actually love you,

1001
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,422
you can count them on one hand.

1002
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,675
You know you're making a fist.

1003
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,136
Whatever.

1004
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,429
Where are your people?

1005
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:34,600
Wow, you ask a lot of questions,
little one. My people aren't around.

1006
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,060
You don't want new ones?

1007
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,270
I'm good.

1008
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,564
You know what? I am hungry.

1009
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,440
I can make a meal
out of anything.

1010
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,359
Pick five ingredients.

1011
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,403
I don't want to. Come
on, this'll be fun.

1012

I don't have time...

1013

of two of those things.

Okay, where
are your pots and pans?

1020
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,963
Pots and pans.

1021
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,341
I know.

1022
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,801
Cool. Cool.

Eh...

1025
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,438
Put in some carrot?

1026
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,814
You're not gonna
chop that carrot?

1027
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,777
You lactose-intolerant?

I'm kid-intolerant.

1029
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,157
How's your cholesterol?

1030
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,366
It's good right now.

1031

I'm gonna go downstairs and get
some supplies. See you later.

is my jokes.

It's worse the second time.
Yeah.

1051

This is kind of like a bunk bed.

I know this sounds
crazy, but do you guys

spy on people with your phones?

Why?

I really need to find
some people.

1058

we will attack.

What is going on?

00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,552
The fish are going
to attack the moon.

But they should attack already.

I can't believe
Sakana told on them.

Of course you can. You can't
trust the fish people.

I think she was bluffing.

Nah, it was a warning. They
come back in the next movie.

No. I haven't
worked in two hours

You got this crazy way
of turning a no into a yes.

How do you do that?

I think when people say no, they're
just really scared of saying yes.

00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,755
to his 25 year stint
on the City Council...

1274
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,923
Whose voice is that?

1275
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,008
I don't know.

1276
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,052
Endorsed by The New York
Times, the New York Post,

1277
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,680
and me, Michael J. Fox.

1278
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,933
Michael J. Fox? It's over.
We're finished.

1279
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,269
If Michael J. Fox endorses
him, then I'll vote for him.

1280
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,437
Listen to me, Michael J. Fox

1281
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,479
is not as great
a guy as you think.

1282
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,702
Oh, no, no. Come
on, he's a Saint.

1283
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,636
I hear there's a tape. Forget it.
I don't wanna hear it.

1284
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,109
You've plateaued.
Michael J. Fox.

1285
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,778
Pay attention. Follow
the little green dot.

1286
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,760
That's you there. I don't need
a pointer to read a graph.

1287
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,950
Well, read this. Annie's taken
you as far as she can, okay?

1288
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,243
But it's not over.

1289
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,369
How bad do you want this?

1290
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,454
I don't start
things I can't win.

1291
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,997
Well, how far are you
willing to go?

1292
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,375
Or should I say, how far
do you want me to go?

1293
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,086
I pay you a lot of money

1294
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,130
for you not to ask me
those types of questions.

1295
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,340
Okay, Guy-O?

1296
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,718
Rat-a-tat-tat, message
received, boss.

1297
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,396
(SANDY WHIMPERS QUIETLY)

1298
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,367
(WHIMPERS QUIETLY)

1299
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,507
Good morning. Made
you breakfast.

1300
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,176
You made me breakfast.

1301
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,803
(CLEARS THROAT)

1302
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:27,099
Hey, I was thinking maybe you would wanna
go in to work with me today.

1303
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,059
Cool. That'd be cool?

1304
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,477
I'll go make us drinks.
All right.

1305
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,688
Don't let your food get cold.
Mmm!

1306
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:36,834
(MOUTH FULL)
Okay. I won't. This is amazing.

1307
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:39,611
Oh...

1308
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,988
Annie, you really
outdid yourself.

1309
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,865
Annie, this is a triumph, honey.

1310
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,035
You got me eating this
thing up like a dog.

1311
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,286
Oh! Mmm!

1312
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,621
This is good. What is it?

1313
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,499
Mmm, paprika, mmm, oregano.

1314
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,836
What is... Mmm, mmm! What
is that, Gouda cheese?

1315
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,463
You wanna know what's Gouda?
This breakfast.

1316
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,971
Cool, a helicopter!

1317
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,307
Yeah.

1318
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,727
Oh! Make sure you duck! Why?

1319
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,687
I don't know. They always
duck in the movies!

1320
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,899
Hop on up.

1321
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,571
All right. Here we go.

1322
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:23,905
Do you get airsick?

1323
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,991
Don't know. I've never
been in the air before.

1324
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,493
Ah. I threw
up on the swings once.

1325
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,914
Annie, we're gonna do
a cell tower check.

1326
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,166
Make sure they're all working.

1327
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,876
You do that yourself?

1328
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,627
Yep, told you work was fun.

1329
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,421
Gilbert, let's roll.

1330
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,594
You'll be all right.

1331
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,683
STACKS: You wanna know the secret
to "Never drop a call"?

1332
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,101
Not really.

1333
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,438
Yes, yes, I do. Desperately.

1334
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:57,856
Good.

1335
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,275
See, we have five times

1336
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,068
as many cell towers
as the other guys.

1337
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,362
But we hide them in plain sight.

1338
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,864
Like right there. You see?

1339
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,785
No.

1340
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,369
It's in her crown.

1341
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,373
Yeah!

1342
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,458
(CHUCKLES)

1343
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,002
ANNIE: That's so cool.

1344
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,506
STACKS: It's beautiful,
isn't it?

1345
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:25,967
How'd you do this? How'd you
become king of the world?

1346
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,363
Well, I wouldn't say
king of the world.

1347
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,553
But I work my butt off.

1348
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,389
The harder I work, the more
opportunities I get.

1349
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,767
See, you gotta play the cards
that you've been dealt,

1350
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,644
no matter how bad the cards are.

1351
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,938
What if you don't
have any cards?

1352
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,523
Then you bluff.

1353
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,983
See, that's what I love
about this city.

1354
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,485
No matter who you
are or what you are,

1355
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,822
you just gotta want it bad enough,
and work with what you got.

1356
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,705
This is just the start
of your story.

1357
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,542
If you got guts,
you'll get glory.

1358
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:02,504
Anyone can make
their dreams come true.

1359
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,214
In New York City.

1360
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,092
And now's the time you
gotta stand tough.

1361
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,845
'Cause if you work
hard, you can rise up.

1362
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:13,974
Anyone can make it, even you.

1363
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,684
In New York City.

1364
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,436
Look at me, I'm
just blood pumpin'

1365
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,189
You and me
are two hearts thumpin'

1366
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:25,610
We are two souls
feeling the same beat.

1367
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:31,324
So take it all,
the city's yours.

1368
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:35,036
It's worth fighting for.

1369
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,372
It's all yours.

1370
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,375
So take it all.

1371
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,878
The city's yours.

1372
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,339
It's worth fighting for.

1373
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,717
It's all mine.

1374
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,970
It's all yours.

1375
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,390
Why don't you go
above 96th Street?

1376
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,850
No reason.

1377
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,688
Gilbert, go uptown.

1378
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,485
This is my New York City.

1379
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,446
Where'd you live?

1380
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,364
Everywhere.

1381
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,160
- Oh, I see a cell tower!
- STACKS: Where?

1382
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,912
See it? Right there.

1383
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,164
Right under that devil bird.

1384
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,583
STACKS: Good eyes.

1385
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:25,295
You know, Annie, sometimes
what you're looking for

1386
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,840
is right in front of your face.

1387
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,467
In New York City.

1388
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,846
So take it all.

1389
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,306
The city's yours.

1390
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,724
The city's mine.

1391
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,559
Worth fighting for.

1392
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,936
It's worth fighting for.

1393
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,438
It's all mine.

1394
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,274
So take it all.

1395
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,609
The city's yours.

1396
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,235
The city's mine.

1397
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,487
Worth fighting for.

1398
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,197
It's worth fighting for.

1399
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,408
It's all mine.

1400
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,494
It's all yours.

1401
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,457
In New York City.

1402
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,583
Grace. Hmm?

1403
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,002
What's our presence
past 96th Street?

1404
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,129
Um, well, we're
mostly focused below,

1405
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,464
but I've been saying
for a while we should try...

1406
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,299
No, but I had it this way.

1407
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,551
Let me do this. I've got it.

1408
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,136
I know what I'm doing.

1409
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,763
Miss Farrell?

1410
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,765
Oh. It arrived. Thanks.
What's that?

1411
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,309
I bought a dress for Annie
to wear to the event tonight.

1412
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,103
It's gorgeous. I just
need you to tie the bow

1413
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:24,145
and make sure that the satin...

1414
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,313
I tie the bow? Yeah.

1415
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,898
I'm dressing her? You
just have to tie the bow.

1416
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,317
No, I... (CLEARS THROAT)
What kind of bow?

1417
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,652
It's just a simple bow.
Like a slipknot?

1418
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,028
'Cause you know I didn't
take Boy Scouts.

1419
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,363
It's very easy, Will.

1420
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,490
And have the satin facing out.
The satin?

1421
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:36,700
Yeah. I knew a girl named Satin.

1422
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,743
I'm sure you did. You
don't need to elaborate.

1423
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,370
Satin and bows is not
necessarily my...

1424
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:41,997
You know what? I'll come over.

1425
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,082
Yeah, I mean, either way. Great.

1426
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,959
She's gonna look gorgeous.
Mmm-hmm.

1427
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,171
Annie.

1428
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,881
(CHUCKLES)

1429
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,007

How is this possible?

didn't catch it at home?

anybody about this?

of the track right here?

worked 20 hours a day.

Work, and work,
and work, and work.

1775

And then, uh, he died.

1776
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,264
I was 12 years old.

1777
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:41,932
What was he like?

1778
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,143
I don't know. I barely knew him.

1779
01:23:44,227 --> 01:23:45,853
He was always working.

1780
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,940
And that's why I felt
like if I worked hard enough,

1781
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:52,568
then that'd probably
bring me closer to him.

1782
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:57,698
And that's why I developed this.

01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,375
(GASPS)

1902
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,586
It's a match.

1903
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:46,822
MOM: We thought
we'd lost you forever.

1904
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:47,881
Me, too.

1905
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:49,383
DAD: We fell upon hard times.

1906
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,467
We just felt it was best for someone
else to look after you.

1907
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:52,552
I figured.

1908
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:54,304
I've never forgiven
myself for it.

1909
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,056
But when we got
back on our feet,

1910
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,682
well, we just couldn't
find you, kid.

1911
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,143
But the angels were looking out.

1912
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,229
Where do you live? New Jersey.

1913
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,106
Ooh. (CHUCKLES)

1914
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,316
But we're moving
to Brazil for my job.

1915
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,609
I think you're gonna
like it there.

1916
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:08,693
ANNIE: Cool.

1917
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:10,237
GUY: Okay, let's get started.

1918
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,030
Everything is, uh, in order.

1919
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:15,909
We have the DNA test
signed by the judge.

1920
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:18,578
Now, we just need
signatures of the parents.

1921
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,497
That's you guys. That's us.

1922
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:24,668
MRS. KOVACEVIC: Ma'am,
sign right there.

1923
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,379
Hey. Remember me from before?

1924
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:29,423
You know what, I do.
That's right.

1925
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,633
I didn't know that you
were Annie's foster mom.

1926
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:33,510
Amongst other things. I know.

1927
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:34,974
She said that you're
a very good singer.

1928
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,096
What'd she say?

1929
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:38,459
(WHINY) "Oh! She's a really
good singer."

1930
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:39,766
No, she didn't do any of that.
She just said

1931
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,185
you have a very nice
voice, and she liked it.

1932
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,688
She did? Yep.

1933
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:48,567
Said it made her feel
good about herself.

1934
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:50,902
MRS. KOVACEVIC: Thank you, Rodney.

1935
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,238
The guardian of record.

1936
01:30:53,322 --> 01:30:55,866
That's you, stretch. Come on.
Right here.

1937
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,202
You sure about this?

1938
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,246
That this is gonna win
you the election? Yeah.

1939
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,790
No. Annie.

1940
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:06,001
You don't pay me
to worry about her.

1941
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:11,173
And the current temporary
guardian, William Stacks.

1942
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,925
Mr. Stacks, we meet again.

1943
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,803
That is a very big pen.

1944
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:20,056
Thank you.

1945
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:23,685
Okay. Well, according
to the State of New York,

1946
01:31:23,936 --> 01:31:27,189
you are officially reunited.

1947
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:28,648
ANNIE: Yay! Great!

1948
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,569
We'll pick you up at 4:00.
Great.

1949
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,404
(CLAMORING)

1950
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,656
All right.

1951
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,825
REPORTER 2: What were they like?

1952
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,076
Hey! Hey, hey, wait!

1953
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,912
How did you do the DNA test?

1954
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:43,997
You can do anything with money.

1955
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:46,958
Well, who are those people,
and what's your plan with her, anyhow?

1956
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:49,294
Don't worry about it.
She served her purpose.

1957
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:50,504
What does that mean?

1958
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,214
That they'll hold
her for a while

1959
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,591
then dump her back in the system
till after the election.

1960
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:56,051
No harm, no foul.

1961
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:58,178
You can't do that to her. I mean,
she's still a little girl.

1962
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:01,181
What do you care? Look, just go
home and keep your mouth shut.

1963
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,642
Hey! You can't talk
to me like that.

1964
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,435
I know things about you.

1965
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,229
Well, if you know
what's good for you,

1966
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:10,524
you'll go home, and keep
your mouth shut.

1967
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:11,983
(ENGINE STARTS)

1968
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,319
REPORTER 3: Mr. Stacks! Has
it helped you in the polls?

1969
01:32:14,403 --> 01:32:18,532
Hey, folks, Mr. Stacks is thrilled
for Annie and her family.

1970
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:21,785
Never drop a citizen.
Vote Stacks for mayor.

1971
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:25,539
REPORTER 4: Annie! Annie! Did you
enjoy seeing them? How was it?

1972
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,165
(CLAMORING)

1973
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,640
We're gonna miss you, Annie.

1974
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:44,766
Yeah.

1975
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:49,187
We can finally get those bubbles
out of the apartment. (CHUCKLES)

1976
01:32:52,334 --> 01:32:53,376
(SOFTLY)
Yeah.

1977
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:03,201
(SIGHS)

1978
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:04,703
Warm enough?

1979
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:06,913
Yeah. Are you?

1980
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:10,375
Yeah.

1981
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,170
Is it dusty in here?

1982
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,089
Nah.

1983
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:17,882
NEWSCASTER: The New York
Post reports Will Stacks

1984
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:19,593
reuniting Annie with her parents

1985
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:22,387
has pushed him into a dead
heat in the race for mayor.

1986
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:25,223
He was once trailing
by as much as 30 points.

1987
01:33:26,225 --> 01:33:29,019
Hey, baby. So, I haven't seen
you in here for a minute.

1988
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:30,186
To what do I owe this pleasure?

1989
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:31,313
Take it easy.

1990
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:33,523
How you doing?

1991
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,442
Not super awesome.

1992
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:37,861
You want me to make you a sandwich?
(SCOFFS, GAGS)

1993
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:39,696
How about if I make you a key?

1994
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:41,740
(SIGHS)

1995
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:43,450
You ever do anything
that you thought

1996
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:45,994
was really a good
idea at the time,

1997
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:48,204
but then after,
it's like you're not so sure.

1998
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,873
Yeah. Putting up that key sign.

1999
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:52,042
I don't know the first
thing about making keys.

2000
01:33:53,377 --> 01:33:55,211
What's the matter, sweetie?
What did you do?

2001
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:57,589
'Cause, whatever it is, you
know I'm here to help.

2002
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:01,593
Why are you so nice to me,
the way I treat you?

2003
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:06,765
Because under all that bitter,
there's a sweet lady with a big heart.

2004
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:10,268
She's just been gone for a while.
That's all.

2005
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:12,729
Hmm.

2006
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:14,773
Yeah.

2007
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:27,285
Who am I, and what have
I become?

2008
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:32,332
Do I stand for something
or for money?

2009
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:38,922
Who am I, and where's my good
girl gone?

2010
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:43,843
You know I had a good
heart once, you see.

2011
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:50,892
Who am I now
that my armor's gone?

2012
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:56,981
You gave me what I didn't
know I needed.

2013
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:03,029
Who am I now
that my heart is won?

2014
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:08,993
I didn't know I needed anyone.

2015
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:12,163

01:53:44,984 --> 01:53:47,611
It's the hard-knock life.

2374
01:53:56,996 --> 01:54:00,332
Don't it feel like the wind
is always howling?

2375
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:03,168
Don't it seem
like there's never any light?

2376
01:54:03,253 --> 01:54:06,380
Once a day don't you wanna
throw the towel in?

2377
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:09,007
It's easier than puttin'
up a fight.

2378
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:12,010
No one's there when your
dreams at night get creepy!

2379
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,513
No one cares if you
grow or if you shrink!

2380
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,391
Empty belly life!

Full of sorrow life!

2383

Santa Claus What's that?
Who's he?

2386
01:54:31,781 --> 01:54:34,658
No one cares for you a bit.

2387
01:54:34,742 --> 01:54:37,619
When you're a foster kid!

2388

01:55:28,713 --> 01:55:30,589
Moonquake, moonquake

2403
01:55:30,673 --> 01:55:32,591
I want to take
a swim in Lake Moon.

2404
01:55:32,675 --> 01:55:35,385
Now I am awake, awake.

2405

Nah-nah-nah-nah Nah-nah-nah.

2414

Ready to destroy
all of humankind.

Nah-nah-nah-nah Nah-nah-nah.

2416
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:05,123
Fierce and fighting

They were never meant to meet.

2427
01:56:28,356 --> 01:56:29,815
But fate didn't listen.

2428
01:56:29,899 --> 01:56:32,985
They were never meant to be.

2429

Like the day we never met.

Moonquake, moonquake.

2468
