1
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:14,932
Even he does not want to do as many presidents...

2
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:18,079
he died of ammonia after 32 days.

3
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,297
So that we can all learn
William Henry Harrison...

4
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:23,674
to wear our skirts
and to wash our hands...

5
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:27,308
so we have a better immune system.
End.

6
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:37,962
Well done, Annie.
Well, Annie B, your turn.

7
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:44,025
Are you sure?
I do not want off of the holiday.

8
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,587
Now come here.

9
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:49,830
Where is your essay?
- Here.

10
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,407
And it's a one-off performance.
- Here we go.

11
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:58,673
My president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
He ​​was elected in 1932.

12
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:03,666
When almost everyone was poor.
Pretty much now, but without the Internet.

13
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:07,807
Everyone except the front row,
are the poor people.

14
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:12,463
You are hungry and angry.
So snarl and stomp your feet.

15
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:23,059
Good news. You are the rich people.
Laugh and clap like you're better.

16
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,525
He liked that, everyone was poor.

17
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:33,587
So He gave them all a job.

18
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,862
He called it "a new deal".

19
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,487
Work hard and you will be rich.

20
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,065
So when I touch you,
you rich.

21
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:43,714
He had people to weigh
and were paid.

22
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:45,988
Trees to cut and were paid.

23
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:48,625
Maybe buy a house.

24
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:52,188
Go to school.
So everyone was happy.

25
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,916
But do not worry people...

26
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,862
you're better than the rest because
you will only get richer.

27
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:06,078
Well done, Annie.
Everyone a good holiday.

28
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:09,632
Go get it?
- I always do.

29
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:12,829
We cover you, good luck.
- That's for losers.

30
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:46,865
Pardon.

31
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:49,669
Do you have time?
- Ten minutes approximately.

32
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,513
I'll bring you back.
- Really?

33
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,162
Promised.

34
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,342
Thanks.

35
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,346
That's loud enough.

36
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:53,819
How many of you want it free? Huh?

37
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,061
I can not hear you.

38
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:09,605
Movies Unlimited ?presents "Annie"
Translation: Unlimited Movies ?

39
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,552
Are there any reservations Bennet?
- Honey, I told you...

40
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:17,003
If there is someone that I think
they are your parents and walk inside...

41
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:19,113
I'll let you know and I mean right.

42
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:22,817
The names Bennet, Sannit, Pannagrannik...
black, white, others...

43
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,411
I let you know.

44
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:26,858
I recommend that you continue to wait.
- Yes.

45
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,915
It is a free SMS phone
never forget a call.

46
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,431
Thanks.

47
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,540
Free SMS phone, right?
- Thanks.

48
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,064
It's good.

49
00:05:57,434 --> 00:06:00,019
A free text phone,
never forget a call.

50
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,559
Now I definitely vote for you for the citizen mastery.

51
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:05,262
You know, this is not a campaign though.

52
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:07,254
But I would love it.

53
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:13,036
Well, that's it. We are ready. Thanks.

54
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:15,459
Give me something, I have the feeling that I am
fire.

55
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:18,194
Make your tongue clean, you've kissed a few
babies, you do not get cramps.

56
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,554
You're right.
- Will anyway.

57
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,342
Shake hands but you
and tell me how you feel.

58
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,030
I feel like a zookeeper.
- Marry me, Will.

59
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,648
Well, of course.

60
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:53,130
Sorry.
- It is good. I only come for the Cannoli.

61
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,699
Will I see you again on Friday?
- You know that.

62
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:07,447
Hey, girl. How did it go?

63
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,353
May I?
- Of course.

64
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:13,221
As long as you give them but to my mom.
- Thanks.

65
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,302
Halt.

66
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,068
I said stop, you little rat.
I know you heard me.

67
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:48,177
Come here.

68
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:54,068
These are Lou.
- If they look too.

69
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:58,669
I will say that you loved them.
- Do you think the world would like an up hand?

70
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:01,838
No, do not want them.
Otherwise you would not be here.

71
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:07,269
And the only reason you are here is because I
get $ 175 a week from the state.

72
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:10,161
And believe me, it's not worth it.

73
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:12,935
I should do up the belt.

74
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,146
You're so handsome.

75
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,169
I was a star.

76
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,472
I was in the biggest band in the world.
C + C Music Factory.

77
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,817
I would go to the "Arsenio Hall Show.

78
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,270
September 16th, 1991.

79
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:32,114
But I was too good for them.
Fired me before I was on the stage.

80
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,522
You have a very nice voice.
- That secret I take my grave.

81
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:41,742
Hey, little monster, I'm not finished with you.
Come here.

82
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:45,320
I have not told you that I was almost
one of Hogies Blowfish.

83
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,698
How did I get here?

84
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:53,680
Have you found them?
- No, but that does not matter.

85
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:56,502
I'm so sorry.
- The witch will hear us.

86
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,612
They will never get to the restaurant.
- Silent, Pepper, they do so.

87
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:02,543
You be quiet, Isabella.
- Annie, will never find her family.

88
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:04,707
None of us.
- Do not say that.

89
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:07,971
Do not listen to her, Mia.
You will be adopted, I promise.

90
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:12,588
That you keep calling.
I'm almost thirteen. Nobody want a teenager.

91
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:15,691
That they want.
We all sit somewhere family.

92
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:18,043
Would you read it again?
- Good.

93
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:21,793
My God, for the millionth time?
- Yes read it, Annie.

94
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:23,551
But quietly.

95
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:30,395
They went to Domani, ordered two Cannoli and
wrote this letter to me.

96
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:34,702
Please get for my baby.
Her name is Annie.

97
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:39,023
We soon for her.
There's half a pendant around her neck.

98
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,102
And we have the other half.

99
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:45,704
So when we come for her,
you know so that she is ours.

100
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:47,789
Can I see it?

101
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:53,820
They all come to us.
I promise.

102
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,888
<i>Maybe far away...</i>

103
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:03,987
<i>or maybe very close</i>

104
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,779
<i>He bestows perhaps coffee...</i>

105
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:13,715
<i>it will establish him perhaps the tie</i>

106
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:17,965
<i>Maybe in a house...</i>

107
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,654
<i>or hidden behind a hill </i>.

108
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:27,455
<i>She plays piano...</i>

109
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,831
<i>He is busy with the bill</i>

110
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:36,848
<i>I bet they're young...
they are smart</i>

111
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:41,333
<i>I bet they collect things like ashtrays and art
</i>

112
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:46,052
<i>I bet they are good.
Why would not it be?</i>

113
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:52,045
<i>Their only fault...
was to give me</i>

114
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:59,732
<i>So maybe it's time...</i>

115
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:05,213
<i>and perhaps when I wake up...</i>

116
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:09,862
<i>they call me baby...</i>

117
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,749
<i>Maybe</i>

118
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,942
<i>I bet he reads...
I bet she's sewing</i>

119
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:40,568
<i>Maybe she does have a closet full of clothes for me
</i>

120
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:45,366
<i>Maybe they are strictly...
Candle Right</i>

121
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:51,273
<i>Makes me nothing...
long as they are mine</i>

122
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:59,262
<i>So maybe now this prayer...</i>

123
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:04,773
<i>The last of his kind </i>.

124
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:09,938
<i>Will you please pick up your child...</i>

125
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:15,236
<i>Will you please pick up your child</i>

126
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:22,490
<i>might</i>

127
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,355
wake up.

128
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:49,026
Wake up, rotblagen.
You out of bed.

129
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:51,910
It's so early.
- And it's Saturday.

130
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:54,550
Thanks for the time and date.
And now the weather.

131
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,152
It's raining. The city administration has called,
they come to inspect.

132
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:02,037
You have to clean the whole house.
- Should they not indicate in advance?

133
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:05,826
Should not I be married to George Clooney?
Your bed and go clean.

134
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:10,975
Who is George Clooney?
- Exactly, girlfriend. Exactly.

135
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,401
No breakfast here until it is spotless.
- I hate her so much.

136
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,817
And if you find more money than a penny,
it's mine.

137
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:26,104
I had the best dream ever.
I was skating on real ice.

138
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:30,582
Save your dreams for the really good stuff.
As shopping with a limitless credit card.

139
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:34,028
Or unlimited candy.
- Or fly to the moon in a rocket.

140
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:36,701
These are all things that will never happen.

141
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:41,448
Now clean as if your life depended on it, because
it is.

142
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,922
It's a hard life.

143
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:49,008
It's a hard life.

144
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:03,125
It's a hard life.
- Wait, what does that mean?

145
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:04,875
That our life sucks.

146
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:13,458
<i>It's a hard life for us</i>

147
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:16,740
<i>Well handled.
We hustled</i>

148
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,623
<i>And kisses.
We are beaten</i>

149
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:21,467
<i>It's a hard life</i>

150
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:26,601
Less sing and cleaning more.
And make sure my bathroom shines.

151
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,127
And do not touch my greenhouse to medications.

152
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:34,017
<i>It's a hard life for us</i>

153
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:37,161
<i>It's a hard life for us</i>

154
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,856
<i>Well handled.
We hustled</i>

155
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,668
<i>And kisses.
We are beaten</i>

156
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:45,388
<i>It's a hard life </i>.

157
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:58,109
<i>Does not it feel like the wind is howling</i>

158
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,179
<i>Does not seem like there is never light</i>

159
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:06,806
<i>Would you ever throw down the towel ?
This is easier than to enter battle</i>

160
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:09,931
<i>There is no one like you
dreams at night are scary</i>

161
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:12,683
<i>Nobody does it matter whether you
grows or shrinks</i>

162
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:15,434
<i>Living with an empty stomach</i>

163
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:18,254
<i>A rotten life</i>

164
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:21,115
<i>A life full of sorrow <. / i>

165
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,903
<i>No future</i>

166
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:26,732
<i>Santa Claus we have never seen</i>

167
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,717
<i>Santa Claus? What is that, who is he?</i>

168
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:32,593
<i>Nobody cares not one soul to you</i>

169
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,569
<i>Because you're a monster child.
It's a hard life</i>

170
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:43,414
Make my bathroom spotless.
But do not get my medication to greenhouse.

171
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,575
<i>It's a hard life for us.
Remove the whiskers from her chin</i>

172
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:53,766
<i>It's a hard life for us.
Prick it with a safety pin</i>

173
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:58,955
<i>Well handled. We are cheated.
And kisses. We are beaten</i>

174
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,453
I'm so sorry.

175
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:09,445
The broom.
- Coming right up.

176
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:12,389
Plastic. Paper.

177
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,759
<i>It's a hard life for us.
Remove the whiskers from her chin.</i>

178
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:25,737
<i>It's a hard life for us.
Prick it with a safety pin</i>

179
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,744
<i>No one gives a soul to you</i>

180
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,788
<i>Because you're a monster child.
It's a hard life</i>

181
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:35,742
I did not sing and dance.

182
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,424
<i>It's a hard life</i>

183
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:45,778
The inspector is there. Here, read a book.
Bostel your hair, blow here.

184
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:48,528
Put ​​this together.
It's a kitty cat.

185
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,231
What should I do?
- Praying.

186
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,513
I tried.
It has not worked yet.

187
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,122
Showtime. You act as if there
good for you will be provided.

188
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:59,051
We love you Miss Hannigan.

189
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:01,724
What is less so, no one believes that.

190
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:05,917
Here you come.

191
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:12,535
Hello, then.

192
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:15,488
Are you Colleen Hannigan?
- That's my maiden name.

193
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,417
But I'm not married with
if you know what I mean.

194
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,808
Come on, the girls are to entertain.

195
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:31,210
Shall we start in the bathroom?
- Mr. Inspector, what are you forward.

196
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:33,758
But I'm right behind you.
- What?

197
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:35,328
What?
- No, I'm asking you.

198
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:37,353
Here.
- Wait, what?

199
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:40,985
He dropped this.

200
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:44,400
This is all the information.

201
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,283
I've been in many homes.

202
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,665
Is this in millions?
- This is our Social Security number, idiot.

203
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,055
What is a citizen service murderer?
- If the government can follow us.

204
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,400
Guard. I must get my file from.
So I can find my parents.

205
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:02,175
I will copy it. You keep them busy.
- Good.

206
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,409
Do you know that people come to the bathroom
but stay in the bedroom?

207
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,222
What?
- You know?

208
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:10,051
Can I go to the library to study?

209
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:14,490
Can we discuss that after the handsome
inspector without wedding ring road?

210
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:21,634
Can I floss, I think I still have a delicious breakfast
I sit in my teeth?

211
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:25,549
The floss is in the medicine greenhouse.
- There?

212
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:29,228
You know, I just remembered,
that we do not floss more.

213
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:31,994
You might want to get some
way to the library?

214
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:35,627
Thank you, Miss Hannigan. Day, Mr. Inspector.
- Goodbye.

215
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:38,502
Sounds like a great kid.
- Yes, it seems so.

216
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,785
That riff I know. How much do you need?
- 42 dollars and 55 cents.

217
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,755
When?
- Now.

218
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,787
Go but rob the bank.
Here's my mask.

219
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,431
I will work for it.
Please, Lou.

220
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:58,571
That face.

221
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,728
Pick them but standing on the corner.

222
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:04,252
Thanks.
- What are you doing, girl?

223
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:08,617
This is not a supermarket.
Change the date.

224
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:14,172
<i>I believe in hard work.
I will not settle with just good. For what I know...</i>

225
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:18,027
<i>I have built my business
to be a global player</i>

226
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:20,578
<i>And that's what I want to with the city do.
I want...</i>

227
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:22,204
<i>I want to make it big again</i>

228
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:26,423
You lie 20 points behind in the polls, have to spend billions
, but it does not work.

229
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,540
How do you change the minds of the people?

230
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:31,243
Everyone counts my money, huh?
- 4.3 billion.

231
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:34,805
I also theaters and sympathize with people who...

232
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:40,188
Satisfied customers there.
- My God.

233
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:42,062
My God, this is terrible.

234
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:43,742
Do you really think a businessman
the city can lead?

235
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:47,375
With Stacks I made a phone network
who never let a call over.

236
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:49,626
As mayor, I make a public...

237
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,985
who never lets a citizen.

238
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:55,749
While citizens live below 69th Street.

239
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:59,194
You are lucky that you can not vote yet.
Politicians are all liars.

240
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,195
How many days do I have to resist them,
these two?

241
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,477
One week before the milk, two for the juice.

242
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:06,945
You should laugh more, you laugh but four times.
- Is that so?

243
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:10,219
Our voters react,
we need a full smile.

244
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,860
And the thumbs up then?
- 16 percent better...

245
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:15,024
when one does, 48 ​​percent.

246
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,213
Why I feel
I wasting my time? I win or not?

247
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:21,009
Because this seems a waste of time.
- We're going to win.

248
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,632
Do this.
- Why? I'm all dressed up.

249
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:28,202
What are you doing? Are we at the Hobo's?
- Do not say that. Say bumbs.

250
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,651
For some reason
they think you're rich.

251
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:32,429
They find you at least not normally.

252
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:35,251
So the girl from Oxford
trying to tell me that it must be me.

253
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,251
I tell you that if you want to have a chance...

254
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:39,994
Do you have to remember where you come from
. Well, Gatsby?

255
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:41,956
Give them compliments the food,
but not too much.

256
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:44,308
I do not eat that food.
- You're going to eat.

257
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:46,300
You like it, but not too much.

258
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:49,535
You do not want too weird look.
- I do not eat food Hobo.

259
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,445
How are people hungry?

260
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:58,085
How can you sleep at night?
- Silk sheets.

261
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,781
See all handsome faces once.

262
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:04,274
Here we go. God bless.

263
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:08,360
I bet you have never had mashed potatoes
Mr. Stacks.

264
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:14,940
Take you kidding me?
My Grandma made the best in Queens.

265
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:18,141
Where I come from.
Born and raised.

266
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,297
Spent on the playground the most time.

267
00:21:20,797 --> 00:21:24,547
I see this once. It's not insane,
but not terrible.

268
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:26,094
See once.

269
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:38,799
This is disgusting.

270
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,487
How awful.

271
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,359
Well...

272
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,992
what did you think of that?

273
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:55,286
Nash, you've seen it. Would you vote for me
if you do not work for me?

274
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:57,532
No, sir.
- Thank you for your honesty.

275
00:21:57,564 --> 00:21:59,251
You're fired.

276
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:02,311
That did not last long.

277
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:05,929
And there is already a parody.

278
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,572
Why winning the Chinese.
- Not really.

279
00:22:15,855 --> 00:22:17,918
Maybe this is a blessing in disguise.

280
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,825
Because you can not go on for mayor,
does not mean you should not do it.

281
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:23,622
We have already discussed, it is good for growing
my profile and the company, plus...

282
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:25,551
that the city needs me.

283
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,036
Easy, Batman.

284
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,356
Let all your staff so talk to you?
- Degen who earn billions for me, though.

285
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:35,397
You make me mayor?
Then you can say anything you want.

286
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,541
Nash, why do we stop?
- Sorry, Mr. Stacks. I'll take it.

287
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:58,086
Next.

288
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:00,766
I want my file.

289
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:04,742
You DO8 form 4380...
- .7 /

290
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,286
And 43 dollars and...
- 55 cents.

291
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:12,820
And an application signed by a parent or...
- a guardian.

292
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:23,841
The entirely true.

293
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:33,694
Do you stare at me all the time?
- Sorry.

294
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,857
Next.
- Would you read it?

295
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,998
I'm too nervous.

296
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:59,005
Annie Bennet. Entered in the 26th district,
estimated age for leaving...

297
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:03,278
four years. State foster care residence,
no further data.

298
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,124
What does no further data?

299
00:24:05,163 --> 00:24:08,569
That there is nothing more.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

300
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:11,744
It gives nothing.
I'll find out there.

301
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:38,592
<i>The sun will come out tomorrow...
...</i>

302
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:42,737
<i>Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow...</i>

303
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:46,145
<i>Sun there will be</i>

304
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:51,027
<i>Just thinking about tomorrow...</i>

305
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:55,138
<i>Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow away...</i>

306
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:58,328
<i>until no more</i>

307
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:04,078
<i>If I were stuck in the day
which is gray and lonely...</i>

308
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:10,762
<i>I just do my chin
up and grin and say...</i>

309
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:17,292
<i>The sun will come out tomorrow...
...</i>

310
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:21,581
<i>so you have to hold on to tomorrow.</i>

311
00:25:22,014 --> 00:25:24,904
<i>what happens </i>.

312
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:31,193
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you, tomorrow...</i>

313
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:35,827
<i>You're only a day away</i>

314
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:55,547
<i>If I were stuck in
the day that's gray and lonely...</i>

315
00:25:55,812 --> 00:26:02,780
<i>I just do my chin up
and grin and say...</i>

316
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:08,198
<i>The sun will come out
... Tomorrow...</i>

317
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:12,433
<i>so you have to hold on to tomorrow</i>

318
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,402
<i>what happens</i>

319
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,285
<i > Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you, tomorrow...</i>

320
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,669
<i>You're only a day away</i>

321
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:32,298
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you, tomorrow...</i>

322
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:50,077
<i>You're only a day away </i>.

323
00:26:57,763 --> 00:26:59,474
That's not your business.

324
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,191
What is going on?
- No idea, I'm not a chemist.

325
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:09,324
Jimmy Neutron showed me this
experimental engine put in it.

326
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:11,660
It shows that he is thinking of the environment.

327
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,082
He thinks ahead.
Oh, nice, here come the pictures.

328
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:17,394
I have to distract her.

329
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:19,597
Let's give her leaves.

330
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:22,276
Madam.
- I'll get a car.

331
00:27:22,347 --> 00:27:24,800
I'm going to run.
- What?

332
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:27,648
I want to be alone.
- We do not have time for.

333
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,765
I know how to walk on the street.
- I will SMS you the route.

334
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:33,038
Not required.
- This is all your fault.

335
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:37,172
Easy, pants.
And you... I'm sorry.

336
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,479
Hey Stacks.

337
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:43,783
Your phones murder me, mate.

338
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,487
Grab him.
- I told you to stop.

339
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:56,660
Try to hit him.
- Leave him alone.

340
00:28:01,668 --> 00:28:03,738
Leave him alone.
- He became afraid.

341
00:28:04,285 --> 00:28:06,035
Leave him...

342
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,338
Watch where you walk.
- You all right?

343
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:13,471
You had reason to be.
- I'm sorry.

344
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,425
This need not, be careful.

345
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,616
Why are you running?
- I'm faster.

346
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:22,243
Children.

347
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:24,602
Children with bacteria.

348
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:36,992
How was the library?
- Educational.

349
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:38,969
What does the word educational for you?

350
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:41,736
I told the inspector
that I no longer want to be your guardian.

351
00:28:41,775 --> 00:28:44,369
Starting next week, you're someone else's problem
.

352
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,854
Did they say who?
- Not one who, sweetheart.

353
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,175
A somewhat. Group House.

354
00:28:53,707 --> 00:28:56,489
Maybe you could learn to talk your mouth off.

355
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:07,693
And, how about that new phones?
- The battery we now have 150 hours.

356
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:11,569
That's not a week, I said I need a week.

357
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:14,836
Currently the fire
phone in the hands of the people.

358
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,485
<i>And then I said it to mommy
and she said to me...</i>

359
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:20,625
<i>she said...
You burn me </i>.

360
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,329
Do not worry
she has signed a statement.

361
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,052
What is Guy?
- You're leading. Five points in the polls.

362
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:30,013
Really? She liked
that he threw the homeless?

363
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,920
<i>No, she liked that he rescued a little girl
which was almost run over by a truck</i>

364
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:37,045
<i>Someone has included
and put on the net, look .</i>

365
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:39,030
<i>I'm a little girl
who does not see where I'm going...</i>

366
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:42,726
<i>But look, the future mayor
save my life.</i>

367
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,594
<i>This is great, Will. I'm telling you...</i>

368
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:47,360
<i>this is the most humane
what you've done so far</i>

369
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,821
With all due respect.
- Displays nothing.

370
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:51,423
You did not tell me,
you tell me anything.

371
00:29:51,478 --> 00:29:54,931
As Batman.
- Listen you must exploit this.

372
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,410
Course.
- Invite her to dinner.

373
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:58,888
<i>Look at how it is with her, a few photos,
the press sucks this</i>

374
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,919
We know we have them?
- That's the best part.

375
00:30:00,974 --> 00:30:05,684
<i>She is a foster child from Harlem.
Did you me? Foster child, Harlem</i>

376
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:07,733
You puffiness go spheres.

377
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:10,092
I'll get her.
- No, I'll get her Grace.

378
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:14,365
Do you want to let him go
to make that little girl afraid?

379
00:30:14,404 --> 00:30:18,661
I do not even know what this is about.
- Please, for me. Thanks.

380
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,675
They hit you completely rotten in Harlem.
- Put me right off.

381
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,847
Thanks.
- Do not turn from me.

382
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:32,435
Is this Colleen Hannigan?

383
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:35,052
<i>No Hable Ingles</i>

384
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:40,675
I wanted to talk about a girl that you care.

385
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,376
Annie.

386
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:50,205
I work for William Stacks
and he wants to take Annie likes to eat out.

387
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:53,415
Why?
- They ran into each other yesterday.

388
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,353
Did not she tell you that?
- No.

389
00:30:55,378 --> 00:31:00,854
We did not have the chance to do our
girls chat last night.

390
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:05,147
Annie. So you said he
had risen against her, huh?

391
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:09,380
Because I've noticed that her neck was a bit
whiplassie.

392
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:13,174
We would like to make a donation
to the charity of your choice.

393
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:15,620
There is so much to choose from.

394
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:18,153
Let's see, of course, save the whales and...

395
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:21,084
clean water,
but you have no whales without water.

396
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,858
You know what, do it in cash.

397
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,663
I go there about sit brooding.

398
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,663
Nice.
- Annie.

399
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:29,147
You know, she's an angel.

400
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,412
We have not inherited the Earth,
but borrowed from our children.

401
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:35,099
That's nice sentiment.
- Here she is.

402
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:39,537
Day Annie, I'm Grace, I work for Mr. Stacks,
the gentleman walked on where you are at.

403
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,334
He would like to invite you to dinner.

404
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:45,002
I promise you that we will not keep you long.
- I can as long as you want.

405
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,915
Is this real?

406
00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:00,470
Unbelievable.

407
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:06,414
Take what you want.
- Really?

408
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,984
Course.

409
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:13,228
I want that, that.

410
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:16,329
Children love candy, huh?

411
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:23,142
Annie? Maybe I should go to
make sure that everything is going great, huh?

412
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,525
I'm fine, thanks.
- Day.

413
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:30,780
Hey, beauty.

414
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:34,085
How does it feel to have a famous child?
- What are you talking about?

415
00:32:34,273 --> 00:32:37,015
It's Annie. Your Annie.

416
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:43,871
Will you go out tonight?
- So low I'm still not sunk.

417
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:47,036
I love it when you treat me so.

418
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:48,826
It's good, she likes me.

419
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:53,622
My God, this is so good.

420
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:56,670
Mr. Stacks would like to take some pictures of you
if that is good.

421
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,358
I think so. Why?

422
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,351
People want to know if you're okay.
- What people?

423
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:03,351
Anyone who has seen it.

424
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,066
Me it is gigantic.

425
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,840
You can listen to whatever you want.
- Talk Radio Can it?

426
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:15,053
Will not you listen to music?
- Love Talk Radio amazing.

427
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,951
There I will be quiet from.
- Me too.

428
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:19,313
I loved it when I was a little girl
...

429
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:22,530
I thought were my friends.
Sorry.

430
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:25,898
That sounded very sad.

431
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:28,610
Sorry. I have many friends.
Do not worry.

432
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:33,142
I work a lot but I had more friends
have.

433
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,003
How many friends do you actually need?

434
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:39,102
I mean when I'm with my parents
and they ask me if I'm lucky...

435
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:42,060
That's a whole different story, right?
But we do not.

436
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:45,580
The fact is that it is not up to you
to that question, so...

437
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,931
Good.

438
00:33:54,172 --> 00:33:58,297
There she is.
Our own little orphan Annie.

439
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:01,984
Foster Child.

440
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:16,338
Hey, this is...
This has got her? Let's do this.

441
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:19,462
Not now.
- Pardon?

442
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,845
Can we eat first, it was a long drive.

443
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,673
Yeah, sure, let's...

444
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:28,697
Let's eat, where we have time for.
Good.

445
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,890
So, how are you after yesterday?

446
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:38,244
What is this about?
- Why do you think?

447
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,768
It's just...

448
00:34:41,761 --> 00:34:45,198
I'm ten, not an idiot.
- I never said.

449
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:49,724
An idiot... or ten. It's actually so...

450
00:34:49,784 --> 00:34:53,010
I do not know how old you are.
- Ten.

451
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:54,768
Now we know you're not an idiot...

452
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,603
but there are many people who
when she saw that picture of us...

453
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,495
thought I would be a good mayor.
- Why?

454
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:03,518
Why? Because I'm a rich guy.

455
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:07,252
I have an orphan rescued.
- Not me, I'm a foster child.

456
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:09,730
And you have not saved me.
- Is that so?

457
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:13,971
I Have not pulled away for a car?
I'm not ready...

458
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:16,579
You know what?

459
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,517
The more we see each other,
the better that is for my campaign.

460
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:22,111
Being elected as the mayor?
- Yeah, crazy, right?

461
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:25,080
I bet if I come to you live
is your president.

462
00:35:25,502 --> 00:35:27,432
That will...

463
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,486
This is not the case.

464
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:35,811
According to him tell me something.

465
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,427
Actually, that's not a bad idea,
Annie who comes to live with you.

466
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:41,787
From what I understand like...

467
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,982
is very busy where you live.

468
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:48,138
Would you like to have some more space?
Do you like that?

469
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:52,055
Living among the richest guy who is there?
Yes, I would like to.

470
00:35:52,087 --> 00:35:54,501
Perfect.
- Guy? What are you talking about?

471
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:58,766
Listen, it's only for a few weeks.
Then she goes back to where they came from.

472
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:01,822
A foster child record, which is at least
15 points in the polls.

473
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:03,782
Guaranteed.
- You want me to play daddy?

474
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:08,361
It's easy. A bed and a meal,
the rest do not have to do anything.

475
00:36:08,386 --> 00:36:11,409
And you get $ 157 a week.

476
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:18,131
I look like I need it?
- Everybody needs that.

477
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:20,148
Here you do not think seriously about it?

478
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:22,679
You wanted to photos?

479
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:26,374
Now she wants the picture.
- We together.

480
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,249
Laughing.

481
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:32,678
Do you really do this?

482
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:35,428
Yes, we do not even notice it is there.
If you have a turtle.

483
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:36,796
I ask myself.

484
00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:38,632
How was lunch?
- What is your name?

485
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:41,319
Her name is Annie. She remains a provisional
at Mr Stacks.

486
00:36:41,351 --> 00:36:43,468
Will he adopt you?
- No.

487
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:45,194
I have parents.

488
00:36:45,226 --> 00:36:48,351
This is only temporary as it is approved.

489
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,679
What?
- Next.

490
00:36:50,718 --> 00:36:53,343
I have a temporary guardian approval
needed, please.

491
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:58,422
There is a waiting period of six weeks
and you form NYS84 /...

492
00:36:58,447 --> 00:37:00,462
Dear God.

493
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:10,895
I do this not normal, but something
I have never encountered before.

494
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:16,014
Young Annie.
Sometimes I forget why I chose this.

495
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:19,501
For my archives.

496
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:24,658
Does the guardian to provide a good home?

497
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,954
Go ahead.

498
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,425
Come in.

499
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:57,589
Is there a temporary replacement guardian?
- No.

500
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,674
Want a temporary replacement guardian?

501
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,558
Shall I lead them around so that you can to work?

502
00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:06,558
Best idea of ​​the day.
- I'm with you.

503
00:38:08,742 --> 00:38:14,494
The state says that at least you
must have a water source...

504
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:18,651
screen.
A window.

505
00:38:20,016 --> 00:38:24,359
And at least one chair per person.

506
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:28,656
I think this Starship Enterprise complies.
I will check off.

507
00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:31,376
How does this work?
- It's a smart home.

508
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:35,953
It recognizes your voice and reacts to it.
Just as a friend.

509
00:38:35,978 --> 00:38:39,774
I see it as a friend.
I have real friends. That are not robots.

510
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:42,752
Let's forget this conversation and the previous one.

511
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:46,033
And start again.
Good.

512
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:48,597
I'm going to record your voice.

513
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:52,472
And then it will be in the system.
Say something.

514
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:55,346
What should I say?
- Does not matter.

515
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:58,205
I think I'm going to like it here.

516
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:03,753
Gotcha. Beautiful.
It's all yours.

517
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,369
I have to go. I'll come back and...
Mrs.?

518
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:11,283
Pardon. Since you may not come.

519
00:39:28,254 --> 00:39:30,941
I think I'll find it fun.

520
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:36,317
<i>I think I'm gonna like it...</i>

521
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:39,584
<i>I'm sure I'll like it</i>

<i>I think I'm going to like it here </i>.

525
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:54,703
<i>Because it knows what you want to see</i>

526
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:57,344
<i>Cool. When I think emerges the</i>

527

00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:09,108
<i>Cool. This allowed me yesterday not</i>

<i>I think I'm going to find it like here</i>

00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:19,254
<i>It's hard to not like

531
00:40:19,905 --> 00:40:23,529
<i>I think I'm going to find it like here.
Yes, yes</i>

532
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:26,942
<i>I think I'm going to like it here</i>

533

534
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:36,185
<i>I think I'm going to find it like here.

535
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,554
<i>I think I'm going to like it here</i>

536
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:43,414
<i>I think I'm going to like it here </ i. >

537
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:48,158
<i>It automatically sets the temperature</i>

538
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,916
<i>That's great. Can learning to swim me</i>

539
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,645
<i>We take a teacher, you need not be afraid</i>

540

<i>I think I'm going to find it like here <. / i>

541
00:40:59,565 --> 00:41:05,127
<i>Everything you dreamed about
sits under your fingerprint</i>

542
00:41:06,036 --> 00:41:15,868
<i>And if it have not dreamed
add it to your wishlist </i>.

543
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,626
Is this the room of Mr. Stacks?

544
00:41:19,665 --> 00:41:22,986
No Annie, this is your room.
- Dear God.

545
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:27,484
<i>I think I'm gonna like it...</i>

546
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:30,485
<i>I know I'm going to like it...</i>

547
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:33,822
<i>I know you will like it</i>

548
00:41:33,901 --> 00:41:37,026
<i>Are you sure you will like it</i>

549
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:42,822
<i>I think I'm going to like here find</i>

550
00:41:42,955 --> 00:41:46,181
<i>Yes, yes. I think I'm gonna like it here</i>

551
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:50,471
<i>Yes, yes.
I think I'm going to like it here</i>

552
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:54,503
<i>I think I'm going to like it here</i>

553
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:56,738
<i>I think I'm going to like it here . Yes, yes</i>

554
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:59,809
<i>I think I'm going to like it here.
Yes, yes</i>

555
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:02,608
<i>I think I'm going to like it here</i>

556
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:07,263
<i>I think I'm going to like it here </i>.

557
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:10,415
Yes, yes.

558
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:14,291
The closet was so big,
I thought it was the living room.

559
00:42:14,322 --> 00:42:16,423
Really?
- How large the living area was then?

560
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:19,025
I thought it was Connecticut.
- My God.

561
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:23,134
Is he nice?
- I think so. He just does not know it yet.

562
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,290
We will miss you, Annie.
- I do not.

563
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:28,743
Finally a little space.
- Well, if you miss me...

564
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:30,595
all you have to do is call.

565
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:37,034
Even for you, Pepper.
I know you're going to miss me.

566
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:41,419
None briefcase huh?
This is junk.

567
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,333
Day Mr. Stacks, or should I say soon
Mr. Mayor?

568
00:42:51,494 --> 00:42:56,275
No thanks, we'll wait here alone.
I'm not looking for companionship.

569
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:59,828
I do not condemn you.
God for all of us is a way.

570
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:02,313
Yours is that you should leave the car.
- What?

571
00:43:02,376 --> 00:43:06,165
Miss? Would you leave the car?
- How dare you...

572
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:10,589
Really? Are you going besprayen me?
Do you think you're better than me?

573
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:13,167
True. I think so.

574
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:15,160
Hey, Miss Hannigan.
- What?

575
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:18,729
I just want to thank
for everything you have done for me.

576
00:43:18,754 --> 00:43:22,637
Do you think your life is a fairy tale?
There is no happy ending.

577
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:27,112
The worst thing is that there is a bit of inherits
because it never lasts forever.

578
00:43:27,152 --> 00:43:30,987
And what you have there of about...
is not so good.

579
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:35,975
Let her speak as she does, remember?
- Shut up.

580
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:39,610
Colleen Hannigan to stay.
Like me on Facebook.

581
00:43:39,642 --> 00:43:42,236
I must not and not to Facebook.

582
00:43:43,509 --> 00:43:45,173
Let's go.

583
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:49,118
Day.
- What was that?

584
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:52,590
Do not worry about it.
- Okay, Nash, we can go.

585
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,747
That does not work, there's a truck.

586
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:59,080
Boogie on your left, Nash. No thanks,
I'm not looking for companionship.

587
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:01,222
What is it with this neighborhood?
- No, that's Lou.

588
00:44:01,261 --> 00:44:03,355
Do you know her name?
- It's a he.

589
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,524
Hey, girl.
- Hey, I got something for you.

590
00:44:06,555 --> 00:44:10,098
No thanks, those are bad.
They steal your private information...

591
00:44:10,123 --> 00:44:13,476
so that large companies you can spy on
and crush your soul.

592
00:44:13,523 --> 00:44:17,609
Really?
- I'm happy for you. That comes your way here.

593
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:19,804
I wish you well.
- Day, Lou.

594
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:21,538
Stay warm, Mr. Stacks.

595
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:25,602
Sorry, he may just not you.
- Many people do not like me.

596
00:44:25,657 --> 00:44:29,305
Why we do this.
- Do not worry, I have a good face.

597
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,469
Let's go take some pictures.

598
00:44:33,817 --> 00:44:36,286
STACKS HAS A BOOST NEEDED

599
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:40,294
STACKS HORSES AROUND foster child

600
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:45,255
FIREFIGHTERS ARE HOT AT STACKS

601
00:44:51,076 --> 00:44:53,912
STACKS IS FRIENDS WITH foster child
He ​​wants to be mayor for two reasons.

602
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:57,466
To feed his ego
and expand his business from.

603
00:44:57,514 --> 00:45:00,076
And now he takes a foster child in the home.

604
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,101
Come on. Do not pee in my ear
and then tell me that the warm rain.

605
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:06,414
Are you saying that Annie is a political movement?

606
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:09,100
It amazes me that he no dog
purchased yet.

607
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:15,464
KATY PERRY:
ANNIE WHO IS THIS?

608
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,093
Are you sure I can have one?
- No.

609
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:20,561
But children love dogs.

610
00:45:20,586 --> 00:45:23,274
If they see
go on the street they all of oooooh.

611
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:25,174
Do I right?

612
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:26,980
Women do the same.

613
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,326
And then?
- Who was separated too early from her group.

614
00:45:35,351 --> 00:45:37,593
She just needs a little love.

615
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:40,953
Not that, licking his own hoeha.

616
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:45,077
Hey, girl, we found each other.
I never leave you, I promise.

617
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:46,945
Annie, how do you call him?

618
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:50,630
It's like a hurricane.
- Sandy. They will be named Sandy.

619
00:45:50,757 --> 00:45:53,014
STACKS CLOSE THE HOLE.

620
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,030
I told you so.

621
00:45:57,124 --> 00:45:59,280
Annie, do you want with us in the picture?

622
00:46:01,132 --> 00:46:02,780
Thank you, Annie.

623
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,307
They really like you.

624
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:11,893
GIRL WITH ANNIE freaks, MAKING A selfie

625
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,351
Who would have thought...
STACKS MAYOR OF NEW YORK?

626
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:44,003
See then.

627
00:46:59,085 --> 00:47:01,717
Is something wrong?
- I can not sleep.

628
00:47:01,742 --> 00:47:04,554
So peaceful here.
What are you doing?

629
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:06,868
I'm at work.
- So late?

630
00:47:06,893 --> 00:47:09,713
Always.
- When do you favor?

631
00:47:09,768 --> 00:47:12,443
That's it.
- I've never been to Disneyland...

632
00:47:12,468 --> 00:47:14,792
but I do not think they have a
administration rollercoaster.

633
00:47:14,817 --> 00:47:18,277
Are you hungry? There is not much to eat here,
only takeaway. 'Fridge...

634
00:47:20,828 --> 00:47:23,359
Go ahead.
- Do not cook?

635
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,127
Or a million servants?
- No, I want to be alone.

636
00:47:27,152 --> 00:47:30,934
Why do you need than all that space?
- Because I want to be alone.

637
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:32,777
Lots of space.

638
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:39,107
I think people
surrounded himself with people just to fill the gap.

639
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:42,616
I believe that the people who really care about you,
you can count on one hand.

640
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:44,821
Do you know that you make a fist?

641
00:47:46,424 --> 00:47:48,134
Also good.

642
00:47:48,189 --> 00:47:51,572
Where are your people?
- You ask a lot of small.

643
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:54,801
My people around me.
- Want new?

644
00:47:54,903 --> 00:47:57,153
It's good.
- You know what?

645
00:47:57,203 --> 00:48:00,203
I'm hungry.
I can make a meal anywhere.

646
00:48:00,228 --> 00:48:02,453
Choose from five ingredients.
- I do not want.

647
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:05,406
Come on. This is fun.
- Listen, I have no time...

648
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,774
It's not a job, but almost as fun.

649
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:16,313
Good. Fusilli, bacon, beef, pomegranate,
truffle, sun-dried tomatoes.

650
00:48:16,347 --> 00:48:18,886
I only have two of those things
ever heard.

651
00:48:19,253 --> 00:48:23,198
Well, where are your pans?
- Pans.

652
00:48:24,765 --> 00:48:26,624
I know.

653
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:36,568
There somewhat.

654
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:41,490
What root there.
- Should you do not chop?

655
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,169
Do you like toast?
- I'm crazy.

656
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:50,787
How is your cholesterol?
- That is good so far.

657
00:48:50,873 --> 00:48:54,373
I'm going down to get some things.
You later.

658
00:48:55,357 --> 00:48:58,014
Are not you glad I'm back?

659
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,662
The sixth ingredient are my jokes.

660
00:49:02,592 --> 00:49:04,193
At the table.

661
00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:06,834
Should we do this?

662
00:49:11,661 --> 00:49:13,247
You take me in the leg.

663
00:49:13,636 --> 00:49:18,582
Sorry, it's dirty, but you must learn to spit
anymore. You're not a camel.

664
00:49:19,535 --> 00:49:22,714
Guy had the crazy idea that I should take note
premiere a movie.

665
00:49:22,808 --> 00:49:24,863
A movie premiere?

666
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:29,289
Can I bring my friends?
- Are there more of you?

667
00:49:29,351 --> 00:49:31,609
More photos.

668
00:49:32,654 --> 00:49:35,333
Good. More photos.

669
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,849
The second time it was even nastier.
- Yes.

670
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:53,733
This seems almost like a bunk bed.

671
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,024
Good morning, Annie.
- Good morning, Nash.

672
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:07,625
I know this sounds crazy, but
spy on you people with the phones?

673
00:50:07,688 --> 00:50:10,992
Why?
- I really want to find some people.

674
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:13,559
Come with me.

675
00:50:13,919 --> 00:50:16,731
Come on, it fails you.
You see.

676
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:20,394
This is the mobile control center.

677
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:22,183
We can sleuth every conversation...

678
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:25,099
every data transmission
done over the past 20 years.

679
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:31,339
People are afraid of the government, but would be afraid of
phone companies.

680
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:33,971
Check for Bennet.
- Check.

681
00:50:35,486 --> 00:50:40,822
There are many coins.
- Can you six years ago, around the 26th district?

682
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:45,739
That will take a while, but we'll let you know.
- Thanks.

683
00:50:59,196 --> 00:51:02,485
Hannigan Has not gotten hold of you?
- No, she's unconscious.

684
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:04,322
From the drink.

685
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:09,136
Mr. Stacks, who are you wearing?
- Our money.

686
00:51:09,355 --> 00:51:11,316
Annie, whom you wear?

687
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:16,356
This is my Isabelle's and this
I found somewhere.

688
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:20,670
Annie, how did you like the French Toast morning?
- How do you know that?

689
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:23,217
You've tweeted.
Annie For reels.

690
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:27,770
I have a Twitter account for you.
1.2 million followers so far.

691
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:29,616
Do you understand?
For reels?

692
00:51:30,131 --> 00:51:32,217
She is for real.

693
00:51:33,072 --> 00:51:34,947
Okay, you get the idea, right?

694
00:51:35,752 --> 00:51:40,294
Stacks phones, never leave a message.
And also vote on me.

695
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:46,760
Things happen for a reason.

696
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:49,259
<i>Says the boy who does not go home
to the moon to go every night</i>

697
00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:50,838
<i>Do not</i>

698
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,119
<i>You know it is not my choice</i>

699
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:54,869
What is happening?

700
00:51:54,924 --> 00:51:58,025
Her moon tears running out.
- Oh, yes. Of course.

701
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:01,852
Did you just say?

702
00:52:03,055 --> 00:52:06,094
<i>You buzzed.
It's your phone</i>

703
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:08,063
That's one of my phones.

704
00:52:08,088 --> 00:52:09,705
<i>It's time </i>.

705
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:12,166
That will cost us $ 500,000.
- What?

706
00:52:12,191 --> 00:52:16,066
Surreptitious advertising.
So you keep it in the market.

707
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:19,035
<i>Enter your orders and return
to the Queen's dome</i>

708
00:52:19,074 --> 00:52:22,363
<i>If you succeed, your mother will be released</i>

709
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:24,379
<i>If not...</i>

710
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:32,700
<i>We're ready.
- Once the moon has settled...</i>

711
00:52:32,763 --> 00:52:35,543
<i>we attack.
- Thanks, Shakana</i>

712
00:52:35,576 --> 00:52:38,216
What is happening.?
- They attack the moon.

713
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:42,545
I know, but that they should have been doing.
There is no longer enough time to get away.

714
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,160
Attack.

715
00:52:54,366 --> 00:52:58,936
<i>He is our vision, he's our man.
'Moon Break'</i>

716
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,725
I can not believe
that they have not told him.

717
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,569
Of course not,
you can not trust the vismensen.

718
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:16,008
That saw you Wanda.
- I think she was bluffing.

719
00:53:16,033 --> 00:53:17,812
It was a warning.
They come back in the next movie.

720
00:53:17,868 --> 00:53:20,352
Will there be a next film?
- Four more.

721
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:22,008
You're kidding.

722
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:27,324
I have to get back to work.

723
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,479
Can not you stay for the party?
- No.

724
00:53:30,023 --> 00:53:33,475
I have not worked for two hours
and three people think I'm dead.

725
00:53:33,742 --> 00:53:37,913
You have worked enough. If you're building
still longer, it touches the sun.

726
00:53:38,908 --> 00:53:41,986
You have a crazy way to
no one to turn to a yes.

727
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:43,650
How do you do that?

728
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:47,979
I think when people say 'no',
they are actually afraid to say "yes."

729
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:50,791
Well, I'm not afraid. No.
- Please.

730
00:53:50,846 --> 00:53:52,681
No.
- Please.

731
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,565
Yes.

732
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,467
I can not believe how long you've been here.

733
00:54:39,498 --> 00:54:42,834
We'll be late for the game.
You do the ceremonial coin toss.

734
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:46,497
And know that both New York teams,
so heads or tails...

735
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,325
you're both happy and sad.
- You're right.

736
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:52,240
You guys go, I stay with the kids.
- You sure?

737
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:57,381
What is that?

738
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:11,839
Can we make a stop?
- Of course.

739
00:55:20,224 --> 00:55:25,193
Do you come here every Friday?
- That's the only day they serve Canoli.

740
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:28,930
And that's all you need to do with it?

741
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:36,448
Do you remember what she looks like?
- I just know it.

742
00:56:03,436 --> 00:56:06,193
What is this?

743
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:08,662
How did you get that?

744
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:11,056
Where did you get it?

745
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:12,962
We are Annie went to the movie...

746
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:15,448
and have candy and soda
and his being skates.

747
00:56:15,494 --> 00:56:18,314
Mr. Stacks is so cool and I fish earrings.

748
00:56:18,369 --> 00:56:21,048
Well done Tessie.
- I can not keep a secret.

749
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:22,846
Packing, it comes back.
- Why?

750
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,721
Because you do not deserve it.
- That we do so.

751
00:56:24,775 --> 00:56:27,181
It is our friend.
- It's not.

752
00:56:27,236 --> 00:56:29,439
And Mr. Stacks either.

753
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:32,440
You are all parasites that suck the life out of you...

754
00:56:32,465 --> 00:56:35,636
and move on when there is nothing more.

755
00:56:35,665 --> 00:56:39,017
You're mean.
- I'm educational.

756
00:56:39,087 --> 00:56:42,383
Pack now.
You look ridiculous.

757
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,007
I did not fall.

758
00:57:02,408 --> 00:57:07,868
<i>Little girls, little girls...
Everywhere I look I see them </i>.

759
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:16,540
<i>Little girls, little girls...
Night and day, eat, sleep and breathe them in I</i>

760
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,728
Get out of here.

761
00:57:19,322 --> 00:57:23,314
<i>I should be anywhere but here</i>

762
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:26,790
<i>Private aircraft, on stage, on TV
</i>

763
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,737
<i>But I'm here in this madhouse...</i>

764
00:57:31,974 --> 00:57:35,115
<i>Small shoes, small socks, I get crazy</i>

765
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:38,537
<i>I mean it, sing no more, I ask you </ i. >

766
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:43,503
<i>I'm locked in a cage until I am crazy</i>

767
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:47,746
<i>I want to leave, but can not,
try to fight my way out</i>

<i>I'm ready to be a star
after all these years,</i>

770
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:59,154
<i>I'm done with it...
With little girls</i>

771
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:04,038
< i> I want someone in this world</i>

772
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:08,992
<i>Little girls, little girls...
Everywhere I look I see them</i>

773
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:17,654
<i>Little girls, little girls...
Night and day eat, sleep, and breathe them in</i>

774
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,149
Get out.

775
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:25,773
<i>I'm locked in a cage until I am crazy</i>

776
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:29,798
<i>I want to leave, but can not,
try to fight my way out</i>

777
00:58:29,823 --> 00:58:32,932
<i>Get me out of here, get me out of here.</i>

778
00:58:33,378 --> 00:58:37,205
<i>I'm ready to be a star

779
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,245
<i>I'm done with it...

00:58:41,322 --> 00:58:45,978
< i> I want someone in this world</i>

781
00:58:46,003 --> 00:58:49,167
<i>Little girls, little girls...</i>

782
00:59:01,603 --> 00:59:05,883
That was great,
hear your voice in your beauty.

783
00:59:05,908 --> 00:59:11,134
You sounded like a church bell as it was stuck
atop a beautiful woman...

784
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:15,041
as a beautiful woman in a church bell sat
not that you looks like.

785
00:59:15,066 --> 00:59:18,870
I do not mean, if you looked like a church bell
I went every day to the church.

786
00:59:18,902 --> 00:59:22,206
I have a t-shirt for you,
you find it, ready?

787
00:59:30,928 --> 00:59:34,771
What? Not your color? Not your size?
I have more in store.

788
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:37,496
You know what I mean call the church, right?

789
00:59:47,887 --> 00:59:52,629
Canoli. One for your lovely girlfriend.
- Thanks.

790
00:59:53,124 --> 00:59:55,953
Sorry girl.
- It is good.

791
00:59:57,941 --> 01:00:02,026
Want to Mr. Stacks not tell you about here?
I would drop him not bother with it.

792
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:03,785
Course.

793
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:08,348
<i>He worked all his life for New York</i>

794
01:00:08,373 --> 01:00:12,623
<i>From his first job as a teacher
until his 25th year in the service of the city</i>

795
01:00:12,701 --> 01:00:14,639
Whose voice is that?
- I do not know.

796
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:20,646
<i>He does it for the New York Times, New York Post
and I, Michael J Fox </i>.

797
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:23,902
Michael J Fox, it's over.

798
01:00:23,956 --> 01:00:26,120
If Michael J Fox is for him,
I vote for him.

799
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:28,675
Listen, he's not such a nice guy
if you think he is.

800
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:30,471
He is a saint.
- I heard there is a tape.

801
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,839
I do not want to hear it.
- You brought it up.

802
01:00:33,058 --> 01:00:36,222
Note, that's you, right?

803
01:00:36,293 --> 01:00:38,543
I do not read graphics.
- Read this then.

804
01:00:38,621 --> 01:00:42,051
Annie brings you as far as she can.
But it is not over.

805
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:43,090
How badly do you want this?

806
01:00:43,144 --> 01:00:44,598
I do not start at
things that I can not win.

807
01:00:44,636 --> 01:00:47,558
How far are you willing to go?
Or should I say...

808
01:00:47,597 --> 01:00:49,402
how far should I go?

809
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,617
I pay you lots of money...

810
01:00:51,703 --> 01:00:55,024
so you're not that kind of questioning me, understood, Guy?

811
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,856
Message received, boss.

812
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:36,585
Good morning.
- I made you breakfast.

813
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:40,288
You have breakfast made for me.

814
01:01:41,955 --> 01:01:46,197
I was thinking of you today
want to come with me to work.

815
01:01:47,383 --> 01:01:49,399
I make drinks for us.
- Good.

816
01:01:49,424 --> 01:01:51,275
Do not eat cold.

817
01:01:53,932 --> 01:01:55,783
This is great.

818
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:02,859
Annie, you've outdone yourself.
This is a win, baby.

819
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:05,700
You let it eat me like a dog.

820
01:02:06,617 --> 01:02:09,617
What is it?
A special?

821
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:11,877
A regulair?

822
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,682
What is that, cheese?

823
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,346
Do you know what's good?
This breakfast.

824
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:25,094
Look, a helicopter.

825
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:30,508
You need to duck.
- Why?

826
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:33,127
No idea that they always do in the film.

827
01:02:35,158 --> 01:02:36,783
Move on.

828
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:40,886
Here we go.

829
01:02:41,074 --> 01:02:44,964
Will you airsick?
- No idea, never been in the air.

830
01:02:45,641 --> 01:02:48,328
I once vomited in the roller coaster.

831
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:53,078
Annie, we're going to do a cell tower check.
Need to know if they all work.

832
01:02:53,118 --> 01:02:56,633
Do you do that yourself?
- Yes, I told you that it is fun.

833
01:02:56,697 --> 01:02:58,658
Let's go.

834
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:04,628
It'll be okay.

835
01:03:08,265 --> 01:03:10,718
Want to know the secret of every
broken conversation?

836
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:12,312
Not really.

837
01:03:12,986 --> 01:03:16,329
Yes, I'll accept that, really like.
- Good.

838
01:03:16,728 --> 01:03:21,157
You know, we have five times
cell towers above the rest.

839
01:03:21,182 --> 01:03:24,807
But we hide them in public
like there, you see it?

840
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:30,182
No.
- It's in the crown.

841
01:03:35,539 --> 01:03:37,735
That's cool.

842
01:03:39,321 --> 01:03:41,203
It's beautiful, is not it?

843
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:44,609
How did you do this?
How did you become the king of the world?

844
01:03:44,674 --> 01:03:47,705
I would not say, but I work
me trashed.

845
01:03:47,752 --> 01:03:50,111
The harder I work, the more opportunities I get.

846
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:54,353
You have to play with the cards you got
, how bad they are.

847
01:03:54,738 --> 01:03:58,152
But if you have no cards?
- Then your bluff.

848
01:03:58,488 --> 01:04:00,488
I love about this city.

849
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:04,011
Whoever you are or what you are,
you have to want it badly enough.

850
01:04:04,082 --> 01:04:05,832
And working with what you have.

851
01:04:11,593 --> 01:04:14,733
<i>This is only the beginning of your story</i>

852
01:04:14,765 --> 01:04:17,648
<i>If you have guts get glory</i>

853
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,990
<i>Everyone can make his dreams come .</i>

854
01:04:21,015 --> 01:04:23,179
<i>In New York City</i>

855
01:04:23,204 --> 01:04:28,875
<i>thousands of times you have to get up.
Because if you work hard, climb up</i>

856
01:04:29,072 --> 01:04:32,697
<i>Everyone can make it, even you</i>

857
01:04:32,722 --> 01:04:34,736
<i>In New York City</i>

858
01:04:34,761 --> 01:04:40,659
Look at me I'm full of confidence.
Even if two hearts are together.

859
01:04:40,684 --> 01:04:44,363
When two souls who want the same.

860
01:04:44,388 --> 01:04:50,106
<i>So take the baby...
The city is yours</i>

861
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:52,638
<i>It's worth fighting for</i>

862
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,857
<i>The is all of you</i>

863
01:04:55,882 --> 01:05:01,546
<i>So take the baby...
The city is yours</i>

864
01:05:01,571 --> 01:05:04,782
<i>It's worth fighting for.</i>

865
01:05:04,844 --> 01:05:10,758
<i>It's all mine.
It is all of you</i>

866
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:15,729
Why did no on 69th Street?
- Just like that.

867
01:05:18,709 --> 01:05:20,584
Gilbert, to the city.

868
01:05:23,821 --> 01:05:26,305
This is my New York City.

869
01:05:26,368 --> 01:05:29,477
Where have you lived?
- Everywhere.

870
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,174
I see a cell tower.
- Where?

871
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:37,705
You see it, there? That devil bird.

872
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:40,365
Good eyes.

873
01:05:40,576 --> 01:05:44,052
Are you Annie...
Sometimes what you're looking for on...

874
01:05:45,565 --> 01:05:47,643
is exactly for you.

875
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:53,551
<i>So get</i>

876
01:05:53,605 --> 01:05:56,512
<i>The city is yours.
- The city is mine</i>

877
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:59,708
<i>It's worth fighting for</i>

878
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:02,324
<i>It's all mine</i>

879
01:06:02,364 --> 01:06:05,168
... <i> So get</i>

880
01:06:05,193 --> 01:06:08,091
<i>The city is yours.

881
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:10,973
<i>It's worth fighting for </i>..

882
01:06:11,035 --> 01:06:13,949
<i>It's all mine</i>

883
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:16,036
<i>It's all of you</i>

884
01:06:18,668 --> 01:06:21,379
<i>In New York City</i>

885
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:24,543
Where our district at 68th Street?

886
01:06:25,168 --> 01:06:29,042
Usually that is down,
but I see it as not.

887
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:33,823
Let me do this. I have it.
I know what I'm doing.

888
01:06:33,879 --> 01:06:36,652
Miss?
- It has come, thanks.

889
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:39,863
What is that?
- I bought a dress for Annie.

890
01:06:40,055 --> 01:06:42,953
It's beautiful.
You must tie the bow...

891
01:06:42,978 --> 01:06:43,962
The bow?
- Yes.

892
01:06:44,025 --> 01:06:46,307
Should I wear it?
- You regulates the bow.

893
01:06:46,697 --> 01:06:49,478
What snare?
- It is a simple bow.

894
01:06:49,533 --> 01:06:52,220
I have not been in the scouts.
- It's very simple, Will.

895
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:54,510
And Satin upwards.
- Satin?

896
01:06:54,535 --> 01:06:56,769
I was a girl named Satin.
- That will be best.

897
01:06:56,794 --> 01:06:59,262
Should I imagine?
- Satin bows is not necessary.

898
01:06:59,325 --> 01:07:02,145
You know what? I'll come along.
- Also good.

899
01:07:02,395 --> 01:07:04,505
You will look beautiful.

900
01:07:53,453 --> 01:07:55,523
You did not see anything.
- No, nothing.

901
01:07:55,578 --> 01:07:57,734
Good. Because I...

902
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,530
I thought I...
No. Seen nothing.

903
01:08:00,992 --> 01:08:03,953
What do you do? Just hang out?

904
01:08:04,617 --> 01:08:07,008
Hello.
- Good evening.

905
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:13,472
Grace, you look great.
- Please, you look...

906
01:08:13,832 --> 01:08:15,887
Handsome, gorgeous.
- No.

907
01:08:15,919 --> 01:08:18,926
Yes, this is old. It is of my grandmother...

908
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:20,992
nothing.
- Your grandmother looked good.

909
01:08:21,038 --> 01:08:23,249
Not that I've ever seen her.

910
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:25,140
I mean that the dress is beautiful.

911
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:28,819
Well, you're sweet.
- You look good.

912
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:30,645
You too.

913
01:08:31,254 --> 01:08:36,582
Let's go and you get dressed. Come on.
- She, yes. I'm all dressed up.

914
01:08:36,662 --> 01:08:38,201
Come on.
- Yes.

915
01:08:48,019 --> 01:08:51,636
Ready?
- Yes. I'm very excited.

916
01:08:56,921 --> 01:09:02,782
Annie, it's beautiful. Simply beautiful.
- I can not believe it.

917
01:09:03,509 --> 01:09:06,485
Ladies we go, we're late.

918
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:11,386
I know.
I have never seen so large a bow.

919
01:09:11,597 --> 01:09:14,636
Yes, and you should do the satin
on the outside of the bow.

920
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:18,619
You know what, like, we're not done yet.
- This is my house.

921
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:21,877
Out.
- Good. Change everything but...

922
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:26,291
This was a Baskien.
Now a dog and a deer.

923
01:09:26,581 --> 01:09:29,299
Why is this combination so ugly?

924
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:32,870
Come on, let's do it.

925
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,081
Why are you not a couple?

926
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:40,455
That's a complicated question.
- Not really, you like him?

927
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:45,187
I work for him.
We can not go together.

928
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,916
I mean he's my friend? Yes.
I find him attractive? Of course.

929
01:09:49,997 --> 01:09:53,473
Not physically, but he looks good.

930
01:09:53,498 --> 01:09:57,763
Beautiful shoulders and cute face.
Beautiful lips.

931
01:09:58,021 --> 01:10:00,771
Beautiful hair.
- I would not bet on it, sister.

932
01:10:01,552 --> 01:10:04,786
I'm far too busy in order to keep me busy so
.

933
01:10:05,184 --> 01:10:07,723
That would be Mr. Stacks say.

934
01:10:08,255 --> 01:10:10,443
Yes, that is so not you?

935
01:10:10,468 --> 01:10:13,929
If my girlfriend Pepper a boy liked
she hit him on the nose.

936
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:17,974
She was suspended, but they play together
in a play.

937
01:10:18,035 --> 01:10:20,519
Sometimes I want Mr. Stacks also hit on his nose.

938
01:10:20,566 --> 01:10:23,378
I mean only hit, I just want to hit him.

939
01:10:23,403 --> 01:10:25,395
He is annoying.

940
01:10:32,759 --> 01:10:36,009
Thank you want to do this, Will.
Your name will look great on it.

941
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:38,862
Do they think the good
that you get their name off?

942
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:41,690
You gave me a hundred million reasons
I have nothing to give.

943
01:10:42,425 --> 01:10:45,487
Have they found anything about my parents?
- No, not yet.

944
01:10:45,558 --> 01:10:49,440
Sorry.
- Thanks for trying.

945
01:10:53,803 --> 01:10:59,623
New Yorkers go challenges every day.
Challenges that seem invincible.

946
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:04,561
We all tell ourselves that fails.
We get that job or not...

947
01:11:04,586 --> 01:11:08,118
no, I can not afford me that school
unless it's you, Franklin.

948
01:11:08,172 --> 01:11:11,226
Coming from the Main Streets
Martins vineyard.

949
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:16,946
Let's change that no's into yes's.

950
01:11:16,971 --> 01:11:21,385
Because if we say 'no'
we are actually afraid to 'yes' to say.

951
01:11:21,829 --> 01:11:26,922
So let 'yes' to say to ourselves
and 'yes' to a better future.

952
01:11:28,787 --> 01:11:33,045
Many of you know that I have recently
a guest.

953
01:11:33,381 --> 01:11:35,358
They only know the word 'yes'.

954
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,695
Will you come here, please?

955
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,976
Go.

956
01:11:41,094 --> 01:11:43,219
Come on, Annie.

957
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:52,198
I do not want to embarrass you, but just let
see where the future of this city is about.

958
01:11:52,223 --> 01:11:57,348
Want something against these people say
which are full of liberal guilt...

959
01:11:57,373 --> 01:12:01,021
except you, Senator. I know you've
tried to build that fence.

960
01:12:04,902 --> 01:12:07,035
I can not believe I'm here.

961
01:12:07,472 --> 01:12:10,449
I have a dress that fills the room.

962
01:12:10,597 --> 01:12:13,628
I am in the middle of a giant cinema wall.

963
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:18,292
With a band that has little violins...

964
01:12:18,676 --> 01:12:20,473
Big violins...

965
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:23,043
And one of those.

966
01:12:23,668 --> 01:12:25,918
A piano.

967
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:29,333
Mr. Stacks has taught me so much.

968
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,693
He gives me a huge opportunity.

969
01:12:33,318 --> 01:12:38,403
<i>Under the glow of bright lights</i>

970
01:12:41,136 --> 01:12:47,121
<i>I turn my face to the hot air</i>

971
01:12:47,432 --> 01:12:55,197
<i>And I'm not afraid of a thousand eyes</i>

972
01:12:55,378 --> 01:13:02,896
<i>If they laugh over five hundred sit</i>

973
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:07,832
<i>I always thought...
- She always thought </i>...

974
01:13:08,296 --> 01:13:12,182
<i>What I would not give for it.
- What she would not give for it</i>

975
01:13:12,273 --> 01:13:16,329
<i>A moment like this..
- A moment like this</i>

976
01:13:16,354 --> 01:13:20,822
<i>This moment, this gift</i>

977
01:13:21,234 --> 01:13:26,015
<i>And see me now with this opportunity</i>

978
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,470
<... i> That is exactly for me</i>

979
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:34,228
<i>One thing I know, it's one-time</i>

980
01:13:34,253 --> 01:13:37,737
<i>I'm going to do my best </i>.

981
01:13:37,762 --> 01:13:42,090
<i>In the spotlight I start my life</i>

982
01:13:42,115 --> 01:13:45,256
<i>A big change is going to happen tonight</i>

983
01:13:45,281 --> 01:13:50,187
<i>Look at me, with this huge opportunity.</i>

984
01:13:50,212 --> 01:13:53,219
<i>You are witnessing my time </i>.

985
01:13:54,732 --> 01:13:58,037
<i>My big chance</i>

986
01:14:00,146 --> 01:14:04,286
<i>I always thought...
- She always thought</i>

987
01:14:04,449 --> 01:14:08,331
<i>What I would not give for it..
- What she would not give for it</i>

988
01:14:08,394 --> 01:14:12,448
<i>A moment like this..
- A moment like this</i>

989
01:14:12,473 --> 01:14:16,973
<i>This moment, this gift</i>

990
01:14:17,504 --> 01:14:21,972
<i>And see me now with this opportunity</i>

991
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:25,338
<... i> That is exactly for me</i>

992
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:30,267
<i>One thing I know, it's one-time</i>

993
01:14:30,315 --> 01:14:33,724
<i>I'm going to do my best </i>.

994
01:14:33,818 --> 01:14:38,208
<i>In the spotlight I start my life</i>

995
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:41,389
<i>A big change is going to happen tonight </i>.

996
01:14:41,467 --> 01:14:46,021
<i>Look at me, with this huge opportunity</i>

997
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:49,468
<i>You are witnessing my time</i>

998
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:53,871
<i>My big chance </i>.

999
01:14:54,918 --> 01:14:57,168
<i>That I will not waste</i>

1000
01:14:59,121 --> 01:15:00,934
<i>I guarantee you</i>

1001
01:15:05,107 --> 01:15:06,810
Take a bow.

1002
01:15:09,177 --> 01:15:12,239
That was great.
Now read my speech for.

1003
01:15:12,264 --> 01:15:14,725
What?
- The speech.

1004
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:18,436
Is everything okay?

1005
01:15:18,553 --> 01:15:20,678
I will be bigger for her.

1006
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:24,186
There. Thank you Mr. Stacks...
- Wait.

1007
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:26,358
No.
- Annie, are you OK?

1008
01:15:28,046 --> 01:15:29,936
Leave me alone.

1009
01:15:38,964 --> 01:15:42,784
This is your big chance.

1010
01:15:42,816 --> 01:15:45,113
To William Stacks to fill.

1011
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,683
Guard.

1012
01:15:58,097 --> 01:16:00,690
What do you do. Wait.
- Honey?

1013
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:03,636
What is it?
- Nothing.

1014
01:16:03,683 --> 01:16:06,964
Young lady tells me immediately what is.
- No.

1015
01:16:07,472 --> 01:16:09,199
You're not my father.

1016
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:17,194
I know.
I know I'm not your father.

1017
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:21,161
But I want to know what is.

1018
01:16:23,889 --> 01:16:25,655
I can not read.

1019
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:32,763
What do you mean? I've seen you read, Annie.
Maybe it was just nervous.

1020
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:35,038
I'm sorry I ruined your campaign.

1021
01:16:36,351 --> 01:16:38,749
What is happening?
- No idea, they panicked.

1022
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:42,523
What were you just talking about?

1023
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:45,851
Or I could help her find her parents,
but it was a dead end.

1024
01:16:45,876 --> 01:16:49,508
I even had some old buddies
of service put it. Nothing at all.

1025
01:16:49,533 --> 01:16:51,401
Her parents.

1026
01:16:52,009 --> 01:16:53,642
Genius.

1027
01:16:54,773 --> 01:16:57,438
Backwards.
- Grace.

1028
01:17:00,096 --> 01:17:02,314
Out of the way, she is still a child.

1029
01:17:02,776 --> 01:17:04,354
She is still a child.

1030
01:17:16,108 --> 01:17:20,373
Who's there?
- Guy. I work for Will Stacks.

1031
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:31,012
Come in.

1032
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:53,023
Colleen Hannigan?
- That's my maiden name.

1033
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:55,859
But I'm not married to it,
if you know what I mean?

1034
01:17:56,487 --> 01:18:00,526
Can I treat you...
on another drink?

1035
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:06,861
So if he wins, I get paid richly,
I mean more than ever.

1036
01:18:06,886 --> 01:18:10,260
Why so much?
- As if it was impossible.

1037
01:18:10,308 --> 01:18:14,136
Do you know how hard it is to make your Will Stacks
election?

1038
01:18:14,191 --> 01:18:16,941
Never an interrupted conversation.
What does that mean? Everybody texting.

1039
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:21,222
There are worse politicians than him.
- I know, I took care of that.

1040
01:18:21,247 --> 01:18:24,536
Schwarzenegger, Kim Jong Il, who
blood diamonds guy?

1041
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:26,090
But I'm over.

1042
01:18:26,427 --> 01:18:29,802
They treat you like a cockroach, as...

1043
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,458
Cockroaches?
- Exactly.

1044
01:18:31,763 --> 01:18:34,731
This is my last chance.
Paid and out steps.

1045
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:37,677
No such thing as a way out.
Believe me.

1046
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:39,998
That is always there, believe me.

1047
01:18:40,295 --> 01:18:43,928
In this case involves finding
Annie's parents.

1048
01:18:44,911 --> 01:18:48,887
<i>I'm tired of the black hand to be</i>

1049
01:18:49,084 --> 01:18:52,326
<i>To do the show in a snake pit</i>

1050
01:18:52,351 --> 01:18:53,857
You sing for me?

1051
01:18:53,889 --> 01:18:57,280
<i>This is our chance to get out of here</i>

1052
01:18:57,335 --> 01:18:58,428
Is this really happening?

1053
01:18:58,476 --> 01:19:02,874
<i>So come on, let's go for it</i>

1054
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:05,640
<i>Easy Street</i>

1055
01:19:06,704 --> 01:19:10,032
<i>Easy Street</i>

1056
01:19:10,651 --> 01:19:16,236
<i > Where to sleep late in the afternoon</i>

1057
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:22,913
If Stacks parents think of Annie
80 percent will go to him choose.

1058
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:25,961
Here we have talked about,
they do not exist.

1059
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:30,235
Then let them exist.
Find a couple who pretend.

1060
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:34,111
Learning every detail of her and
miraculously appear just before the election.

1061
01:19:34,237 --> 01:19:36,502
Water there, and you have parents.

1062
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:38,776
What's in it for me?
- Same as me.

1063
01:19:39,878 --> 01:19:42,745
And, no cockroach anymore.

1064
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:47,346
<i>I'll be the girl in jewelry</i>

1065
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:50,995
<i>The crowd goes wild when I sing</i>

1066
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:55,902
<i>I do not have to look at a fire escape</i>

1067
01:19:55,927 --> 01:19:59,997
<i>There will be signs of me</i>

1068
01:20:00,607 --> 01:20:03,755
<i>Easy Street</i>

1069
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,036
<i>Easy Street </i>.

1070
01:20:08,364 --> 01:20:10,114
In a way out.

1071
01:20:17,297 --> 01:20:20,716
<i>Move those feet.
To...</i>

1072
01:20:21,552 --> 01:20:24,443
<i>Easy Street </i>.

1073
01:20:25,369 --> 01:20:29,557
<i>If you're there...</i>

1074
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:32,948
<i>If you're there...</i>

1075
01:20:33,526 --> 01:20:36,932
<i>If you're there...</i>

1076
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:41,210
I like you.

1077
01:20:42,374 --> 01:20:44,952
Then not too good.

1078
01:20:46,128 --> 01:20:48,011
On Easy Street.

1079
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:04,123
I told her that she can do what she wants
in this city and...

1080
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,358
discover that they can not even read.

1081
01:21:06,943 --> 01:21:08,779
How can that be?

1082
01:21:09,589 --> 01:21:13,354
She is lost, many people do.
- That is unacceptable.

1083
01:21:13,886 --> 01:21:15,698
We should arrange a teacher for her.

1084
01:21:16,066 --> 01:21:19,698
For her, not for the press?
- To her.

1085
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:23,368
What?

1086
01:21:23,686 --> 01:21:26,561
I feel you laugh with those pouting lips.

1087
01:21:26,608 --> 01:21:29,654
Your secret's safe with me.
- What secret?

1088
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,482
That you care about her.
- I give to the children in New York City.

1089
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:35,342
And Annie.

1090
01:21:36,334 --> 01:21:38,209
Well, she lives in New York.

1091
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:40,326
Why do I care for her.

1092
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:43,363
She is a warm blanket, it's...

1093
01:21:43,457 --> 01:21:45,793
What a drama,...

1094
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,775
Annie? Where are you going?

1095
01:21:59,892 --> 01:22:03,149
Thanks for everything.
I'm sorry I screwed up last night.

1096
01:22:03,228 --> 01:22:05,532
I hope you still
mayor may be.

1097
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,845
What are you talking about? Come back.

1098
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:11,334
It's good.

1099
01:22:11,412 --> 01:22:14,155
I have practiced a lot to be kicked out.

1100
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:19,824
Listen... Put your bag down.

1101
01:22:20,214 --> 01:22:22,675
You're going nowhere.
- Sandy should look like.

1102
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:24,971
Stop it, you and Sandy remain here.

1103
01:22:24,996 --> 01:22:27,246
And I do not care
what happened yesterday.

1104
01:22:27,271 --> 01:22:29,324
I mean, Sandy must.

1105
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:31,950
No... Sandy needs?

1106
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:34,873
Well, the Champagne or gelatte?

1107
01:22:35,022 --> 01:22:38,264
What?
- Is Mountain do, or just do?

1108
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:40,483
Is lemonade or kipnugguts?

1109
01:22:40,584 --> 01:22:44,694
I should go, now I want to go.
For my bladder is full, come on.

1110
01:22:45,304 --> 01:22:49,327
I saw you write your name.
- That's the only thing I can.

1111
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:53,468
And your teachers, how is this possible?
- I can hide it well.

1112
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:57,506
And at home? Did not they get caught there?
- Home?

1113
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:00,045
Why did no one tell this?

1114
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:03,266
It's not that the world
To a foster child.

1115
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:07,001
And it's embarrassing.
I do not want anyone knowing.

1116
01:23:09,844 --> 01:23:11,445
You know what?

1117
01:23:13,345 --> 01:23:15,056
I want to show you something.

1118
01:23:21,582 --> 01:23:24,824
Stop here but.
- Where are we?

1119
01:23:24,894 --> 01:23:27,347
Queens.
- Do I need my passport?

1120
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:33,821
The truth is that everyone has something
what nobody knows.

1121
01:23:34,212 --> 01:23:35,720
Including me.

1122
01:23:35,946 --> 01:23:38,579
For me... this is it.

1123
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:41,762
This is my family.

1124
01:23:41,919 --> 01:23:44,067
Can you see them now?

1125
01:23:44,989 --> 01:23:46,849
I say in my thoughts.

1126
01:23:46,973 --> 01:23:50,348
This part of the job, as did my father.

1127
01:23:50,418 --> 01:23:53,582
20 hours a day.
Work, work, work.

1128
01:23:53,957 --> 01:23:56,770
And then...

1129
01:23:57,387 --> 01:23:59,231
I was twelve.

1130
01:23:59,475 --> 01:24:01,756
What was he like?
- No idea.

1131
01:24:01,804 --> 01:24:04,241
Could he barely. He always worked.

1132
01:24:04,526 --> 01:24:08,018
And so I thought if I worked hard enough...

1133
01:24:08,996 --> 01:24:11,965
me to bring it closer to him.

1134
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:16,542
And that's why I developed this.

1135
01:24:16,793 --> 01:24:18,308
Well...

1136
01:24:19,606 --> 01:24:22,027
Now... you got this.

1137
01:24:29,471 --> 01:24:33,549
You know Annie, I have something in my eye...

1138
01:24:33,596 --> 01:24:36,556
Let's go there.
Since the trains go.

1139
01:24:46,776 --> 01:24:49,924
Hey, tailored suit, you need to register first.

1140
01:24:49,964 --> 01:24:52,089
What?
- Auditions.

1141
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:57,001
Guard.

1142
01:24:57,681 --> 01:25:00,463
We've been trying to find.

1143
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:02,376
Where is she?
- There, why?

1144
01:25:03,026 --> 01:25:06,432
Guard. Stop.

1145
01:25:07,643 --> 01:25:09,440
That's an interesting choice.

1146
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:13,635
Honey, it's so good to see you,
after all these years.

1147
01:25:13,682 --> 01:25:17,940
We tried to find and
when we saw pictures of you with...

1148
01:25:17,965 --> 01:25:20,574
that nice man who stands for election.

1149
01:25:20,636 --> 01:25:23,761
Let us sing
special song that we only have three.

1150
01:25:23,793 --> 01:25:25,215
Medal.

1151
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:31,101
The sun will shine again...

1152
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:32,655
Pronto.

1153
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:35,664
Bet your bottom dollar that...

1154
01:25:35,689 --> 01:25:37,595
Pronto.

1155
01:25:37,712 --> 01:25:41,837
There will be sun.

1156
01:25:43,657 --> 01:25:46,516
What is this?
- A disaster.

1157
01:25:46,586 --> 01:25:48,993
You're dirty, you false. Next.

1158
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:51,844
I think it's really good script.
David Clemend says hello.

1159
01:25:51,892 --> 01:25:53,540
Out.

1160
01:25:54,134 --> 01:25:55,634
What are you doing?

1161
01:25:55,681 --> 01:25:57,688
You told me to find two people
to play the parents.

1162
01:25:57,766 --> 01:26:01,313
I meant your friends.
No audition hold round.

1163
01:26:01,361 --> 01:26:03,853
These were returned calls, I know
right?

1164
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:06,424
And why do they sing?
- They love musicals.

1165
01:26:06,502 --> 01:26:09,549
With a song, without reason,
is suddenly magical.

1166
01:26:09,588 --> 01:26:12,791
There is a window a bed there,
a table here your hat there.

1167
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:18,327
You're done. I rule the parents.
You do nothing. I'll call you when I need you.

1168
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:21,405
But.
- But no. We run out of time.

1169
01:26:40,856 --> 01:26:43,426
Once the castle seen from the friendly dragon?

1170
01:26:43,465 --> 01:26:45,075
No.

1171
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:53,136
Do you also marshmallows?
Snack?

1172
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,108
You make me laugh.

1173
01:27:08,794 --> 01:27:10,559
Hey, Grace...

1174
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:13,490
I want to ask you something.

1175
01:27:14,665 --> 01:27:19,758
How difficult is it exactly
to become a foster parent?

1176
01:27:19,896 --> 01:27:22,755
<i>And not temporary, but more...</i>

1177
01:27:23,419 --> 01:27:26,341
You know, a permanent situation.

1178
01:27:26,505 --> 01:27:29,232
You mean adopt Annie?
- Yes...

1179
01:27:29,548 --> 01:27:33,415
how you call it.
- If you call it, Will.

1180
01:27:33,969 --> 01:27:35,820
Dan...

1181
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:38,773
Yes.

1182
01:28:02,329 --> 01:28:05,227
We have overslept.

1183
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,281
Which do you prefer, Will?

1184
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,414
Red.

1185
01:28:12,358 --> 01:28:16,037
It's been two hours ago,
she's not ready yet.

1186
01:28:16,085 --> 01:28:18,124
Not quite but...

1187
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:21,109
We have another battle plan.

1188
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:24,296
We really have a different battle plan.
- Do not say that.

1189
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:28,429
Annie's parents. They have seen her picture
and called us, it's a miracle.

1190
01:28:29,164 --> 01:28:30,749
Other regroup.

1191
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:33,797
They searched her for years,
but she is not in the system.

1192
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:36,376
How do they know that she is their daughter?
- They know everything about her.

1193
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:39,642
From the medallion, the letter and yes...

1194
01:28:40,012 --> 01:28:43,699
I've done a DNA test.
Bingo.

1195
01:28:47,304 --> 01:28:48,968
DNA test.

1196
01:28:50,929 --> 01:28:52,890
Tell her yet.

1197
01:28:53,487 --> 01:28:57,349
I want to see first, Annie knows.
- I would not want it otherwise.

1198
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:01,045
You must be the one who
told Annie that we found her parents.

1199
01:29:01,077 --> 01:29:03,163
Have you found my parents?

1200
01:29:04,287 --> 01:29:07,037
Yes, we think.
- Really?

1201
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,739
Yes, we meet them at Domani.

1202
01:29:09,764 --> 01:29:12,725
Here comes the letter from.
I knew they were coming.

1203
01:29:16,207 --> 01:29:18,246
I'm happy for you, Annie.

1204
01:29:18,473 --> 01:29:22,585
I know you always wanted this.
- And all thanks to you.

1205
01:29:29,044 --> 01:29:33,520
I can not believe I see them.
I flip all.

1206
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:47,448
I'm very happy for you.
- Thanks.

1207
01:29:48,114 --> 01:29:50,677
Annie. The Reunion.

1208
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,285
Annie.
- My girl.

1209
01:29:56,278 --> 01:29:58,996
She passes together.
Let's see.

1210
01:30:01,197 --> 01:30:03,259
They fit together.

1211
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:06,541
We thought we'd lost you forever.
- Me too.

1212
01:30:06,566 --> 01:30:10,378
We struggled and found it
the best that someone else made for you.

1213
01:30:10,441 --> 01:30:12,863
I thought so - I've never forgive myself..

1214
01:30:12,996 --> 01:30:16,769
And then we were back on its feet,
we could not find it again.

1215
01:30:16,861 --> 01:30:19,236
But the Angels babysat you.

1216
01:30:19,322 --> 01:30:21,259
Where do you live?
- New Jersey.

1217
01:30:22,453 --> 01:30:25,101
But we move to Brazil for my job.

1218
01:30:25,156 --> 01:30:27,086
You will find there be fun.

1219
01:30:27,242 --> 01:30:30,757
Well, let's begin.
- Everything is in order.

1220
01:30:30,782 --> 01:30:34,617
We have the DNA test
signed by the judge.

1221
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:37,369
Now we have only the signature of the parents
needed.

1222
01:30:37,423 --> 01:30:39,900
That you are.
- We.

1223
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:43,277
Ma'am, sign there.

1224
01:30:44,604 --> 01:30:47,557
Do you remember me?
- You know what I do?

1225
01:30:48,081 --> 01:30:51,863
I did not know you were Annie's foster parent.
- Among others.

1226
01:30:51,902 --> 01:30:54,050
I know. She said you sing very well.

1227
01:30:54,075 --> 01:30:57,137
Then she said, she can sing very well.

1228
01:30:57,162 --> 01:31:00,496
No, she said you had a good voice
and liked.

1229
01:31:01,427 --> 01:31:03,693
Is that so?
- Yes.

1230
01:31:04,185 --> 01:31:07,185
She said that she felt there good.

1231
01:31:09,809 --> 01:31:14,457
The foster parent must also sign here.

1232
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,611
Are you sure?
- How you are going to win the election? Yes.

1233
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:22,564
No... Annie.

1234
01:31:22,589 --> 01:31:24,901
You do not pay me to make me worry about her.

1235
01:31:25,058 --> 01:31:30,104
And temporary foster parents, William Stacks.

1236
01:31:30,815 --> 01:31:33,409
Mr. Stacks, we see each other again.

1237
01:31:33,674 --> 01:31:35,815
This is a very large pen.

1238
01:31:36,885 --> 01:31:38,541
Thanks.

1239
01:31:38,566 --> 01:31:42,597
Well, according to the New York State...

1240
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:46,301
you're officially reunited.

1241
01:31:48,131 --> 01:31:51,513
We pick you at four hours.
- Nice.

1242
01:31:57,969 --> 01:32:00,539
Guard. How did you do the DNA test?

1243
01:32:00,813 --> 01:32:02,860
We have not done anything with money.

1244
01:32:02,922 --> 01:32:05,703
Who are these people, what's your plan further?

1245
01:32:05,738 --> 01:32:09,081
Do not worry, she did what needed.
- What do you mean by that?

1246
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:13,301
They hold her for a while and then
throw back into the system after the elections.

1247
01:32:13,326 --> 01:32:17,021
Nothing to worry about.
- I can not do your hair, she is still small.

1248
01:32:17,046 --> 01:32:20,624
What do you care?
Go home and keep your mouth shut.

1249
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:24,256
Do not talk to me.
I know things about you.

1250
01:32:24,281 --> 01:32:28,960
If you know what's good for you,
you go home and you keep your mouth shut.

1251
01:32:33,091 --> 01:32:37,076
People, Mr. Stacks is very happy
for Annie and her family.

1252
01:32:37,101 --> 01:32:40,608
Never Drop a citizen.
Rate Stacks for mayor.

1253
01:33:01,169 --> 01:33:03,857
We will miss you, Annie.
- Yes.

1254
01:33:04,714 --> 01:33:07,620
Can finally that bubbles out of your apartment.

1255
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:25,353
Warm enough?
- Yes. You too?

1256
01:33:30,894 --> 01:33:34,729
Is it dusty here?
- No.

1257
01:33:34,754 --> 01:33:39,183
The New York Post reports the reunification
Annie with her parents by Will Stacks...

1258
01:33:39,208 --> 01:33:42,279
as he climbs in the polls...

1259
01:33:45,099 --> 01:33:47,716
Hey, baby I got you one minute
not seen.

1260
01:33:47,787 --> 01:33:49,646
Where I thank this?
- Calm down.

1261
01:33:50,012 --> 01:33:53,887
How are you?
- Not really amazing.

1262
01:33:54,051 --> 01:33:56,051
Do I make you a sandwich?

1263
01:33:56,488 --> 01:33:58,692
Or a key?

1264
01:34:00,204 --> 01:34:05,842
Ever done something that you thought
it was a good idea, but afterwards...

1265
01:34:05,882 --> 01:34:08,671
know you're not so sure?
- Yes, key service.

1266
01:34:08,718 --> 01:34:11,085
But I do not know.

1267
01:34:11,984 --> 01:34:15,062
What is it? What have you done?
Whatever it is...

1268
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,906
I am here to help you.

1269
01:34:18,015 --> 01:34:20,570
Why are you so nice to me?

1270
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:23,163
Because I know that underneath all that bitter...

1271
01:34:23,265 --> 01:34:25,890
a sweet woman sitting with a big heart.

1272
01:34:26,617 --> 01:34:29,226
She plays just a moment before God
that's all.

1273
01:34:41,144 --> 01:34:45,191
<i>Who am I and what I have become</i>

1274
01:34:45,641 --> 01:34:51,289
<i>I Stand for something or money for only </i>?

1275
01:34:52,825 --> 01:34:57,684
<i>Who am I and what is my good side</i>

1276
01:34:57,830 --> 01:35:00,963
<i>You know you once had a good heart</i>

1277
01:35:01,065 --> 01:35:03,244

1278
01:35:05,207 --> 01:35:10,121
<i>Who am I now my Annie way</i>

1279
01:35:10,473 --> 01:35:15,168
<i>You gave me what I needed and did not know</i>

1280
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:22,191
<i>Who am I now my heart is warm</i>

1281
01:35:22,422 --> 01:35:27,804
<i>I did not know he needed someone</i>

1282
01:35:27,829 --> 01:35:33,943
<i>But I have today and will have...</i>

1283
01:35:33,968 --> 01:35:39,750

1286
01:35:46,535 --> 01:35:51,620
<i>And with me there</i>

1287
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:54,543

<i>Remember what I want</i>

1290
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,774

1292
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:16,645

01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:21,706
<i>Who am I to live my life alone</i>

1294
01:36:22,048 --> 01:36:27,423
? = = <i> Always looking for a place to call home
</i>

1295
01:36:29,262 --> 01:36:33,903
<i>Who am I to meet myself</i>

1296
01:36:33,928 --> 01:36:38,443
<i>Because it feels good, but something not again</i>

1297
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:42,712

1298

<i>And with me there</i>

1312
01:37:39,417 --> 01:37:41,628
I will begin again.

1313
01:37:58,709 --> 01:38:01,857
Boys?
I need your help.

1314
01:38:11,346 --> 01:38:15,017
I give this back to you.
It will not do it in Brazil.

1315
01:38:15,103 --> 01:38:18,313
We have not yet, but Ecuador, Bolivia...

1316
01:38:18,377 --> 01:38:22,666
Columbia and Bogota that is difficult to enter.

1317
01:38:22,691 --> 01:38:24,394
There I heard about it, yes.

1318
01:38:26,745 --> 01:38:29,847
I made something for you.
- Really?

1319
01:38:33,823 --> 01:38:37,081
That's me, that is sandy and that's you.

1320
01:38:37,433 --> 01:38:39,643
I have taken Stacks of the phone.

1321
01:38:44,028 --> 01:38:45,942
I will miss you.

1322
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:57,095
Are you ready?
- We go directly to the airport.

1323
01:38:58,161 --> 01:39:02,489
It was great to know you, Annie.
You're such a special girl.

1324
01:39:05,018 --> 01:39:06,733
You must save his nose Mr. Stacks.

1325
01:39:06,758 --> 01:39:09,214
See if you
together in the park can play.

1326
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:13,916
Then you have a true friend.
- That was between us. Good?

1327
01:39:14,457 --> 01:39:16,754
I'd like to help.

1328
01:39:17,074 --> 01:39:19,371
No, thanks.

1329
01:39:19,396 --> 01:39:22,763
We do not believe in.
In aid, and you did.

1330
01:39:30,681 --> 01:39:34,134
Word never limp.
- You needed it.

1331
01:39:37,801 --> 01:39:40,176
What a cute dog.

1332
01:39:41,223 --> 01:39:43,036
Come on.
- Day.

1333
01:39:50,887 --> 01:39:53,106
Day, Annie.

1334
01:39:53,247 --> 01:39:55,934
The press eats us.
We're going to strike.

1335
01:39:56,108 --> 01:40:01,412
Day, Harold.
Pathetic guest.

1336
01:40:06,311 --> 01:40:08,678
Grace, where we stayed with that battery?

1337
01:40:08,741 --> 01:40:11,397
What?
- Another week, how about it?

1338
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,632
Almost done.
- That's not enough.

1339
01:40:13,695 --> 01:40:16,235
But... - We've wasted enough time.

1340
01:40:16,814 --> 01:40:19,290
I'm going to call the research department.

1341
01:40:27,710 --> 01:40:29,749
Go for it, girl.

1342
01:40:47,741 --> 01:40:50,170
I hate to see you like this.
- I'm fine.

1343
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:52,702
Mr. Stacks, this want to know.

1344
01:40:52,727 --> 01:40:54,383
Annie is in trouble.
- What?

1345
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:55,977
Those were her parents.
- What?

1346
01:40:56,016 --> 01:40:58,859
What is going on?
- Ignore her because she is obviously crazy.

1347
01:40:58,884 --> 01:41:00,594
Keep your big mouth, drizzles.

1348
01:41:00,665 --> 01:41:03,165
I've done something terrible
and I'm sorry.

1349
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:05,063
What do you mean, it's not her parents?

1350
01:41:05,088 --> 01:41:07,457
He Annie's take on something
go.

1351
01:41:07,482 --> 01:41:10,509
I can not believe I've danced with you.
- Have you danced with him?

1352
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:12,619
I was desperate.
- Where's Annie?

1353
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:15,400
What have you done?
- Where's Annie?

1354
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:17,986
Is it cold in Brazil?

1355
01:41:23,621 --> 01:41:26,910
Gather your ashtrays?
- No.

1356
01:41:27,059 --> 01:41:29,473
Arts?
- No.

1357
01:41:29,621 --> 01:41:31,957
Do you play the piano?
- Shut up close.

1358
01:41:31,982 --> 01:41:36,677
Where are we going?
- We take you for a while. Relax.

1359
01:41:36,702 --> 01:41:38,788
You are not my real parents, right?

1360
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:42,616
Sit.
- What are you doing?

1361
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:44,350
Sit silent.
- Let me go.

1362
01:41:44,375 --> 01:41:47,396
If Mr. Stacks finds out...
- That you do not want.

1363
01:41:47,421 --> 01:41:49,272
Why do you think we can do?

1364
01:41:50,366 --> 01:41:52,429
Do you work for Mr. Stacks?

1365
01:41:52,811 --> 01:41:55,561
He would not do this.
- Yeah, well...

1366
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:57,819
I think he has enough photos.

1367
01:42:01,029 --> 01:42:03,342
Has Mr. Stacks done this?

1368
01:42:09,837 --> 01:42:13,040
Call the FBI, I want everyone to have on it.

1369
01:42:13,095 --> 01:42:14,766
Regularly.
- I want the police.

1370
01:42:14,822 --> 01:42:16,790
I'm an idiot,
never thought this would happen.

1371
01:42:16,845 --> 01:42:18,469
How can you not know who it is?

1372
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:21,922
I have a man who controls it all.
So we stay clean, trust me.

1373
01:42:21,954 --> 01:42:24,555
I can not trust,
you stole Annie.

1374
01:42:42,207 --> 01:42:45,348
Look.
- I agree, Annie.

1375
01:42:47,096 --> 01:42:49,252
Grab her.

1376
01:42:49,463 --> 01:42:51,455
Sit silent.
- Do not touch me.

1377
01:42:56,383 --> 01:42:58,242
Everybody listen.

1378
01:42:58,305 --> 01:43:01,375
I want you each call
checked within a radius of 10 km.

1379
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:03,002
That you could do that?

1380
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:05,322
Someone put a picture of Annie
Twitter.

1381
01:43:05,369 --> 01:43:07,181
Where?
- 54th and 6th.

1382
01:43:07,236 --> 01:43:09,471
And another on Annie's blog.
She was waving.

1383
01:43:09,525 --> 01:43:11,283
57th and 6th.
- Let's go.

1384
01:43:12,539 --> 01:43:14,867
If you do this everyone knows.

1385
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:17,703
Remember mayor
it destroys your company.

1386
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:20,196
That does not matter to me.
- You're making a huge mistake.

1387
01:43:20,221 --> 01:43:22,151
Think of everything you've worked for.

1388
01:43:22,195 --> 01:43:24,351
That means nothing.
You're fired.

1389
01:43:25,078 --> 01:43:29,383
You. Talk to him.
You are the only one to whom he listens.

1390
01:43:31,846 --> 01:43:33,838
Not that they can hear you.

1391
01:43:39,057 --> 01:43:40,870
The next problem.

1392
01:43:40,909 --> 01:43:42,909
Is this a Bell 429?
- What?

1393
01:43:42,979 --> 01:43:45,589
Can a guy if I do not understand
helicopters?

1394
01:43:45,895 --> 01:43:48,871
I know nothing of helicopters, it is here.

1395
01:43:48,924 --> 01:43:51,010
Gilbert, let's go.
- Roger.

1396
01:43:57,068 --> 01:43:59,216
Is anyone else dizzy?

1397
01:44:04,346 --> 01:44:06,839
Another picture on Instagram, 65th end.

1398
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:08,558
To the west.

1399
01:44:16,133 --> 01:44:17,719
What are you doing?

1400
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,789
Keep her quiet.

1401
01:44:24,191 --> 01:44:26,207
We will find her, Will.

1402
01:44:26,832 --> 01:44:29,441
She is seen on the George Washington Bridge.

1403
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:33,824
She waves, she does it on purpose.
- To the Town.

1404
01:44:42,236 --> 01:44:44,392
There she is.

1405
01:44:44,798 --> 01:44:46,806
Not lose her sight.

1406
01:44:52,068 --> 01:44:54,732
In Annie's blog, she goes to the park.

1407
01:44:54,771 --> 01:44:58,123
To the park increased.
Do not let me fly this helicopter.

1408
01:45:02,051 --> 01:45:04,793
There they are.
- Hey, Annie.

1409
01:45:05,107 --> 01:45:07,255
I do not think they can hear you.

1410
01:45:15,322 --> 01:45:17,025
There is the police.

1411
01:45:28,397 --> 01:45:31,061
Stacks. Why is he following us?

1412
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:58,808
Country him.
- Cut them off.

1413
01:46:00,217 --> 01:46:03,256
I hope we find Annie quickly.

1414
01:46:16,691 --> 01:46:19,769
Everything good?
- Yes. Are we even now?

1415
01:46:19,808 --> 01:46:21,707
Do you want a picture?

1416
01:46:22,996 --> 01:46:26,121
So it is not.
- Yes.

1417
01:46:26,379 --> 01:46:29,364
You do not care about me
I was just a chance for you.

1418
01:46:29,395 --> 01:46:31,012
That is not so.
- Yes.

1419
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:35,074
This made you so you could be mayor.
- No, you have to trust me.

1420
01:46:35,106 --> 01:46:37,410
I can not, I can not trust anyone.

1421
01:46:37,887 --> 01:46:39,684
Let me go.

1422
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:43,644
I'm sorry about what happened.
I can not look right...

1423
01:46:43,676 --> 01:46:47,840
and tell you that I did not know there was something
going on but I did not.

1424
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:50,867
You have to believe me.

1425
01:46:54,032 --> 01:46:56,329
This is you, Annie.

1426
01:46:58,360 --> 01:46:59,938
You're it.

1427
01:47:05,984 --> 01:47:09,515
I retire officially back
for mayor.

1428
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:14,394
I think the city
deserves someone better than me.

1429
01:47:14,419 --> 01:47:18,291
I want to have time to concentrate
matters that are important to me...

1430
01:47:18,316 --> 01:47:20,410
and that is this great girl, Annie.

1431
01:47:22,398 --> 01:47:24,015
Because...

1432
01:47:27,951 --> 01:47:30,060
It's dusty here.

1433
01:47:33,259 --> 01:47:35,345
So dusty it is not.

1434
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,867
That my family.

1435
01:47:41,719 --> 01:47:43,274
Thanks.

1436
01:47:57,031 --> 01:47:59,257
I need one thing from you.

1437
01:48:00,047 --> 01:48:02,109
You keep going.

1438
01:48:02,367 --> 01:48:04,234
What now?

1439
01:48:04,758 --> 01:48:06,992
Stop playing games.

1440
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:13,355
Course.

1441
01:48:14,316 --> 01:48:17,362
Everything good?
- Yes.

1442
01:48:18,525 --> 01:48:22,135
Listen, I've always had a problem
to see what's in front of me...

1443
01:48:22,822 --> 01:48:24,455
But I'm learning it.

1444
01:48:25,775 --> 01:48:27,798
Want to eat out with me?

1445
01:48:28,353 --> 01:48:29,853
What?

1446
01:48:30,595 --> 01:48:33,876
I mean... without you I can not function.

1447
01:48:33,901 --> 01:48:36,089
That this does not work like that, I mean...

1448
01:48:36,267 --> 01:48:41,204
You were right about everything,
on Guy on the wind...

1449
01:48:41,238 --> 01:48:43,379
About everything.
- Stop.

1450
01:49:00,977 --> 01:49:05,805
<i>Together at last.
- Together forever</i>

1451
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:10,455
<i>We make a knot,
that they can never break</i>

1452
01:49:10,747 --> 01:49:15,075
<i>I do not need sunshine
to blue to color the sky.. .</i>

1453
01:49:15,495 --> 01:49:20,190
<i>I do not need anything more than you</i>

1454
01:49:20,609 --> 01:49:25,405
<i>You have wrapped me
that cute little finger</i>

1455
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:30,289
<i>You made life a song.
You made me a singer</i>

1456
01:49:30,314 --> 01:49:35,313
<i>You are not warm and fuzzy.
- And the most intelligent guy</i>

1457
01:49:35,338 --> 01:49:41,291
<i>But now I'm back, it could not be better </i>..

1458
01:49:42,289 --> 01:49:45,750
I'm telling you, it was horrible.
- Today was a nightmare.

1459
01:49:45,783 --> 01:49:49,720
<i>But that was then, because I was looking for...</i>

1460
01:49:49,745 --> 01:49:52,472
<i>looking for my final piece</i>

1461
01:49:52,509 --> 01:49:56,376
<i>Now I have nothing else need more than you</i>

1462
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,348
<i>Because I was looking for...</i>

1463
01:49:59,637 --> 01:50:01,918
<i>looking for my final piece</i>

1464
01:50:01,943 --> 01:50:06,052
<i>Now I have nothing more necessary than you</i>

1465
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:10,937
<i>But I know nothing can separate us...
</i>

1466
01:50:10,962 --> 01:50:15,868
<i>But nothing that I know...
can separate us</i>

1467
01:50:15,893 --> 01:50:20,861
<i>But I know nothing can separate us...
</i>.

1468
01:50:20,886 --> 01:50:25,878
<i>But I know nothing can separate us...
</i>

1469
01:50:39,374 --> 01:50:42,257
<i>Everybody dance now</i>

1470
01:50:42,296 --> 01:50:44,929
No, it's dance now.

1471
01:50:44,974 --> 01:50:49,302
<i>Together at last.
Together forever</i>

1472
01:50:49,472 --> 01:50:54,518
<i>We make a knot,
that they can never break</i>

1473
01:50:54,543 --> 01:50:59,535
<i>You belong together.
The happiest couple now</i>

1474
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:04,372
<i>When stars that float on air now</i>

1475
01:51:04,397 --> 01:51:08,733
<i>And what is the title of the
dream come true </ i? >

1476
01:51:11,042 --> 01:51:16,073
<i>I have nothing else, different, different...</i>

1477
01:51:16,454 --> 01:51:20,383
<i>I do not need anything more than you</i>

1478
01:51:20,408 --> 01:51:23,689
If he continues to dance and sing like that,
he would never win.

1479
01:51:25,118 --> 01:51:28,813
The city is full of opportunities.
It's up to you to use it.

1480
01:51:28,877 --> 01:51:30,978
The sun will come out tomorrow.

1481
01:51:31,703 --> 01:51:37,679
