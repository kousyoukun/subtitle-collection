1
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,370
虽然他为了当总统  付出了很多
"So, even though he wanted to do a lot as President,

2
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,720
但是仅仅上任32天后  就死于肺炎
"he died of pneumonia after only 32 days.

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,600
因此  威廉·亨利·哈里森的故事告诉我们
"So, we can all learn from William Henry Harrison

4
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,020
要注意保暖  勤洗手  这样才能拥有更好的免疫系统
"to wear our coats and wash our hands, so we have better immune systems.

5
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,730
说完了
"The end."

6
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,200
安妮  真棒
Good job, Annie.

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,410
好了  2号安妮  该你了
Okay, Annie B., your turn.

8
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,410
快下课了吧  我可不想耽误大家的假期时间
You sure there's time? I don't wanna keep anyone from vacation.

9
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,620
先上来
Just get up here.

10
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,710
你的演讲稿呢  在这里
Where's your essay? Up here.

11
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,340
而且还有即兴表演
And it's more of a performance piece.

12
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,090
开始吧
Here we go.

13
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,590
我演讲的总统是富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福
My president is Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,800
他于1932年当选  那时候人人都很穷
He was elected in 1932, when almost everyone was poor.

15
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,140
就像现在一样  不过那时没有英特网
So, pretty much just like now, but without the lnternet.

16
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,100
除了各行业的尖端人才  其他都是穷人
Everyone except the front row, you be the poor people.

17
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,860
饥饿与愤怒  让你咆哮  让你跺脚
You're hungry and mad. So, growl and stomp your feet.

18
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,030
恭喜第一排的同学  你们是富人
Front row, good news, you're the rich people.

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,330
一边微笑  一边鼓掌  你们比其他人做得好
Laugh and clap like you're better than everybody.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,290
但是富兰克林不想大家都那么穷  于是他给了大家工作
But FDR didn't like it that everyone was poor, so, he gave them all jobs.

21
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,460
他将这项措施  称为新政
He called it the New Deal.

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,720
勤奋工作  你就会变得富裕
Work hard, and you get rich.

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,260
我拍了一下的  都是富人
So, when I tap you, you're rich.

24
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,810
他让人们修路赚钱
He had people build roads and got paid.

25
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,350
砍树也可以赚钱
Cut down trees and got paid.

26
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,150
买房子  上大学都变得简单了
Made it easy to buy a house, go to college.

27
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,150
很快  整个国家的人民都很高兴
Soon, the whole country was happy.

28
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,940
富人们  你们也别担心
But don't worry, rich people.

29
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,070
你们还是比其他人富裕  因为你变得更富裕了
You're still better than everyone because you get even richer!

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,580
说得好  安妮  祝大家假期愉快
Good job, Annie. Have a good vacation, everyone!

31
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,830
你可以及时赶到吗  我一向都可以的
You gonna make it in time? I always do.

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,710
我们帮你做掩护  祝你好运  运气是给失败者准备的
We'll cover for you. Good luck. Luck's for suckers.

33
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,730
明天...明天
Tomorrow... To-To-Tomorrow

34
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,820
明天
To-Tomorrow

35
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:24,280
我们的生活举步维艰
It's the hard-knock life for us

36
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,950
不好意思  你的车还剩多少时间归还  还有10分钟
Excuse me! Do you have any time left? I have about 10 minutes.

37
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,660
我来帮你还吧  真的吗
I'll return it for you. Really?

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750

I think I'm gonna like it here

43
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,630

你应该洗洗你的舌头

我说了别动  你这个小鬼
I said freeze, you little rat.

83

我知道你听见了
I know you heard me.

88
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,040
你以为大家喜欢一个  伶牙俐齿的小女孩吗
You think the world wants a smart-mouthed little girl?

89
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,040
不喜欢  或者说  你不该在这儿的
No, they don't, or you wouldn't be here.

90
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,990
让你待在这儿的唯一原因是
And the only reason you are here is

91
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,460
国家每周会给我157美元
because I get $157 a week from the state.

92
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,170
相信我  其实根本不值得的
Which, believe me, is not worth it.

93
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,680
我应该用皮带  把你绑起来  你这个小鬼
I should put a leash on you, you little...

94
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,260

September 16th, 1991.

99
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,070
我对他们太客气了  我还没上台  就把我炒了
But I was too good for them! Fired me right before I went out on stage.

100
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,820
你的嗓子很好
You have a very pretty voice.

101

我到死都会守着这个秘密

Hey, you little monster, I wasn't done with you! Get back here!

我还没有告诉你
I haven't told you

104
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,670
我差点就加入  猫头鹰与河豚鱼乐队了
how I was almost one of Hootie's Blowfish.

105
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,880
我怎么会这样
How did I get here?

106
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,760
你找到他们了吗  没有  不过没关系
Did you find them? Nah, but it's okay.

107
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,760
真遗憾  真遗憾  安妮
So sorry. Sorry, Annie.

108
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,890
那个巫婆会听见我们说话的
The witch will hear us.

109
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,420
他们永远都不会去那间餐馆的
They're never gonna be at that restaurant.

110
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,680
闭嘴  佩珀  他们会去的
Be quiet, Pepper. Yes, they are.

111
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,220
你才闭嘴  伊莎贝拉
You be quiet, lsabella.

112
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,600
安妮永远也找不到她的家人  我们都找不到
Annie's never gonna find her family. None of us are.

113
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,850
别这么说  别听她的  米娅
Don't say that. Don't listen to her, Mia.

114
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,520
很快就会有人收养你了  我保证
You're gonna get adopted. I promise.

115
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,070
你总是这么说  我已经13岁了  没有人想要青少年
You keep saying that. I'm almost 13. No one wants a teenager.

116
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,660
会有人要的  我们的家人肯定在某个地方
Yes, they do. We all have families somewhere.

117
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,740
你可以再读一遍你的留言吗  好的
Can you read your note again? Okay.

118
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,700
天啊  读了一百万遍了吧
Oh, God. For the millionth time?

119
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,950
对  快读  安妮  不过小声点
Yeah, read it, Annie. But quietly.

120
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,250
他们去了多玛尼餐馆  点了两份油煎酥饼
They went to Domani's, ordered two cannolis,

121
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,800
然后给我写了这封留言
and wrote me this note.

122
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,760
"请照顾我们的孩子  她叫安妮
"Please take care of our baby. Her name's Annie.

123
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,550
我们很快就会来接她
"We'll be back to get her soon.

124
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,470
她的脖子上有半个盒式挂链  另一半在我们这儿
"There's half a locket around her neck, and we have the other half,

125
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,190
等我们遇到她了  就能认出她是我们的孩子"
"so when we come for her, you'll know that she's our girl."

126
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,400
我可以看看嘛
Can I see it?

127
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,650
他们会过来找我们的  我保证
They're gonna come back for all of us. I promise.

128
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,410
Maybe far away

129
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,200
Or maybe real nearby

130
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,420
He may be pouring her coffee

131
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,050
She may be straightening his tie!

132
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,180
Maybe in a house

133
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,310
All hidden by a hill

134
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,600
She's sitting playing piano

135
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,150
He's sitting paying a bill!

136
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,320
Betcha they're young

137
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,150
Betcha they're smart

138
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,200
Bet they collect things Like ashtrays, and art!

139
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,620
Betcha they're good

140
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,370
Why shouldn't they be?

141
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,790
Their one mistake

142
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,130
Was giving up me!

143
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,180
So maybe now it's time

144
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,680
And maybe when I wake

145
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,560
They'll be there calling me "baby"

146
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,150
Maybe

147
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,090
Betcha he reads Betcha he reads...

148
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,250
Betcha she sews Betcha she sews...

149
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,510
Maybe she's made me A closet of clothes!

150
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,010
Maybe they're strict

151
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,640
As straight as a line

152
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,600
Don't really care

153
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,600
As long as they're mine

154
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,610
So maybe now this prayer's

155
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,030
Maybe now this prayer...

156
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,740
The last one of its kind

157
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Won't you please come get your "Baby"

158
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,590
Maybe

159
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,080
起来  快起来  小鬼们
Wake up! Wake up, rats. Get out of bed!

160
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,000
还早呢  今天是星期六
It's so early. And it's Saturday.

161
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,040
谢谢你们提醒我时间和日期  现在我们再说说天气吧
Thanks for the time and date. Now, over to Stormy for the weather.

162
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,500
下雨了
It's raining!

163
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,930
市里来电话了  他们要过来检查
The city called. They're coming to inspect.

164
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,170
你们快起来大扫除了
You gotta go and clean this whole place up!

165
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,380
他们没有提前几天通知我们吗
Aren't they supposed to give a couple days' notice?

166
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,430
我是不是应该嫁给乔治·克鲁尼
Aren't I supposed to be married to George Clooney?

167
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,390
快起来打扫
Get out of bed and start cleaning!

168
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,100
乔治·克鲁尼是谁
Who's George Clooney?

169
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,020
问得好  小朋友
Exactly, girlfriend. Exactly.

170
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,600
不打扫干净  就不能吃早餐
No breakfast until this place is spotless!

171
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,940
我好讨厌她
I hate her so much.

172
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,320
要是找到任何零钱  只要超过5美分的都是我的
And if you find any loose change over a nickel, it's mine.

173
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,360
我刚刚正在做一个美梦  我在滑雪  真正的雪
I was having the best dream. I was ice-skating on real, live ice.

174
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,910
还是把美梦留到好事上吧
Save your dreams for good stuff.

175
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,620
比如拿着无限卡购物
Like shopping with an unlimited credit card.

176
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,040
在糖果里游泳
Or swimming in candy.

177
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,500
坐火箭飞到月球上  这些事永远也不可能
Or flying to the moon in a rocket ship. All things that will never happen.

178
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,550
快点  快起来扫地  因为这就是你们的命
Now, clean like your life depends on it. 'Cause it does!

179
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:33,550
举步维艰
It's the hard-knock life.

180
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,280
等等"举步维艰"  是什么意思
Wait. What does "hard-knock life" mean?

181
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,820
就是生活就像屎一样
It means our life sucks.

182
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,530
那确实
Then, yeah.

183
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,700
It's the hard-knock life for us!

184
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,870
'Steada treated We get tricked!

185
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,920
'Steada kisses We get kicked!

186
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,670
It's the hard-knock life

187
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,710
大扫除的时候别唱歌
Less singing and more cleaning!

188
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,760
要把我的浴室擦得亮堂堂
And make sure my bathroom shines!

189
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,340
不过别碰我的医药箱
But don't touch my medicine cabinet!

190
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,270
It's the hard-knock life for us!

191
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,150
'Steada treated We get tricked!

192
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,110
'Steada kisses We get kicked!

193
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,230
It's the hard-knock life

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,460
Don't it feel like the wind is always howling?

195
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,500
Don't it seem like there's never any light?

196
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,170
Once a day don't you wanna throw the towel in?

197
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,340
It's easier than puttin' up a fight

198
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,090
No one's there when your dreams at night get creepy!

199
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,550
No one cares if you grow or if you shrink!

200
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,560
Empty belly life!

201
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,430
Rotten smelly life!

202
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,020
Full of sorrow life!

203
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,230
No tomorrow life!

204
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,030
Santa Claus we never see

205
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,990
Santa Claus What's that? Who's he?

206
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,660
No one cares for you a bit

207
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,830
When you're a foster kid!

208
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,950
It's the hard-knock life!

209
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,880
"要把我的浴室擦得亮堂堂  不过别碰我的医药箱"
"Make my bathroom shine! But don't touch my medicine cabinet!"

210
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,460
好样的  米娅
Good one, Mia.

211
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,670
It's the hard-knock life for us Yank the whiskers from her chin

212
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,720
It's the hard-knock life for us Jab her with a safety pin

213
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,430
'Steada treated, we get tricked Send her to the loony bin

214
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,180
'Steada kisses, we get kicked

215
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,320
对不起
I'm so sorry!

216
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,150
把扫把递给我  来了
Toss me the broom! Incoming.

217
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,650
塑料
Plastic!

218
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,610
纸罐头
Paper! Can!

219
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,960
It's the hard-knock life for us Yank the whiskers from her chin

220
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,790
It's the hard-knock life for us Jab her with a safety pin

221
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,710
No one cares for you a bit Send her to the loony bin

222
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,630
When you're a foster kid!

223
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,470
It's the hard-knock life

224
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,800
我说了  不要唱歌跳舞
I said no singing and dancing!

225
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,010
举步维艰
It's the hard-knock life

226
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,770
检察员来了  给  看书  帮她梳头  你吹这个
The inspector's here. Here, read a book. Braid her hair. Blow on this.

227
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,650
把这些拼好  是凯蒂猫
Put this together. It's a kitty cat.

228
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,730
那我干什么  你祈祷
What should I do? Pray.

229
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,700
我试过了  一点都没用
I've tried. It hasn't worked yet.

230
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,450
来了  好好表现  要表现出我照顾的很好
Okay. Showtime! You guys, act well cared-for.

231
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,580
我们爱你  汉尼根小姐
We love you, Miss Hannigan!

232
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,370
这还是算了  没人会相信的
Take it down a thousand. Nobody's gonna believe that.

233
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,080
快进去
Get under here.

234
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,720
你好
Well, hello there.

235
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,680
你是科琳·汉尼根吗
Are you Colleen Hannigan?

236
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,990
这是我婚前的名字
My maiden name.

237
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,100
不过我还没有结婚  你懂我的意思吧
But I'm not married to it, if you know what I mean.

238
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,720
不懂  快进来  孩子们都在里面玩呢
No. Come on in. The girls are just recreating.

239
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,150
我们从浴室开始检查吧
Should we start here in the bathroom?

240
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,110
为什么  检察员  你怎么这么心急
Why, Mr. lnspector, how forward you are.

241
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,150
不过我都听你的
But I'm right behind you.

242
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,450
什么  什么
What? What?

243
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,530
不是  是我在问你  这边
No, I'm asking you. This way.

244
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,870
等等  你说什么
Wait, what?

245
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,530
你真强壮
Your arms are so strong!

246
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,910
这家伙掉了这个
The dude dropped this.

247
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,080
上面有我们的全部信息
This has all of our information.

248
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,710
真的吗  你在开玩笑吧
Really? You're kidding.

249
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,790
该死的  我住过很多家庭  上面说我住过上百万的家庭
Damn. I've been in a lot of homes. This says I've been in millions.

250
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,960
那是你的社保号  傻瓜
That's your Social Security number, dummy.

251
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,050
社保号是什么
What's a scoso curcurity murder?

252
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,420
就是政府跟进我们用的
It's what the government uses to keep track of us.

253
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,680
等等  这正是我要找的  用它来找我的父母
Wait. This is what I need to get my records. And find my parents.

254
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,600
我要复印下来  想办法出去
I'll copy it down. Plan your exit.

255
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,180
好的
Okay.

256
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,690
人们一般进了浴室  就不想出去了
You know, people come for the bathroom, but they stay for the bedroom.

257
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,400
什么  你懂得
What? You know it.

258
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,190
我可以去图书馆学习吗
Can I go to the library to study?

259
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,540
我们可以等这个
Can we talk about this after

260
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,650
没带结婚戒指的检查员帅哥走了再说嘛
the handsome inspector with no wedding ring is gone?

261
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,860
好吧
Okay.

262
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,820
那我去找牙线
Can I have some floss?

263
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,530
我猜是营养的早餐  害得我塞住牙缝了
I think I have some nutritious breakfast stuck in my teeth.

264
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,660
什么
What?

265
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,370
牙线在医药箱吧
Pretty sure I saw some in the medicine cabinet.

266
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,410
在那里吗
Right there?

267
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,080
我才想起来  我们的牙线用完了
You know, I just remembered. We're out of floss.

268
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,250
你还是拿几本书去图书馆看书吧
Maybe you wanna pick some up on your way to the library.

269
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,750
谢谢  汉尼根小姐
Thank you, Miss Hannigan.

270
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,090

Bye, Mr. lnspector. Bye, now.

271
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,340
这孩子就像个大人一样
Seems like a great kid.

272
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,380
是的  她很不错
Yeah, she seems great.

273
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,770
我知道怎么回事  你要多少
I know that run. How much you need, mija?

274
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,940
43  55美元
$43.55.

275
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,110
什么时候要  现在
By when? Now?

276
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,940
去抢银行吧  我借你头套
Go rob Bank of America. Here, I'll loan you my mask.

277
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,240
我可以帮你做事  求你了  卢
I'll work for it. Please, Lou.

278
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,740
看你那表情
That face.

279
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,120
去把过期的饮料  从冰箱里拿出来  快去
Take the expired drinks from the cooler. Go ahead.

280
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,450
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

281
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,910
你干什么  小鬼
Whoa, what are you doing, girl?

282
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,790
这不是全食公司的嘛  别扔了  改一下保质期
This ain't no Whole Foods. Don't throw them out. Change the date.

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,290
我相信任务艰巨  我不会接受"好"
I believe in hard work. I don't just settle for "okay."

284
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,960
我只接受"很棒"
"Great" is all I know.

285
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,880
我的公司跻身于世界前列
I built my company to be a worldwide leader.

286
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,300
对于这个城市  我也想这么做  我想再次成功
And that's what I wanna do with the city. I wanna make it great again.

287
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,050
你还落后了20%的选票
You're 20 points down in the polls.

288
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,810
你已经花费数十亿  却毫无成效
You've got billions to spend and it's not working.

289
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,480
你打算怎么改变大家的想法
How are you gonna change people's minds?

290
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,230
大家都想数一数我的钱
Everybody wants to count my money.

291
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,560
43亿
4.3 billion.

292
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,310
我很有感触  我明白人民的感受
You know, I have feelings. And I feel for people that are out there...

293
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,980
巴巴布伊  巴巴布伊  你看
Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Yes. See.

294
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,360
他可能就是我的忠实粉丝
That's probably one of my satisfied customers right there.

295
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,160
我的天啊  太糟糕了
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is terrible.

296
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,740
你真的认为  一个商人可以经营这个城市
Do you really think a businessman can run the city?

297
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,230
在斯塔克斯手机公司
At Stacks Mobile,

298
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,410
我搭建了一个从不漏接电话的手机网络
I made a cell network that never drops a call.

299
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,080
作为一个市长  我创建的政府
As mayor, I'm gonna make a government

300
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,830
将从不落下一个市民
that never drops a citizen.

301
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,670
是啊  只要那些市民都住在市中心
Yeah, as long as those citizens live below 96th Street.

302
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,260
你要庆幸你还不能投票  政治家都是骗子
You're lucky you can't vote yet, mija. Politicians are all liars.

303
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,050
这两个的保质期要怎么改
What dates should I change these to?

304
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,390
牛奶改成一个星期  果汁改两个星期
One week for the milk. Two weeks for the juice.

305
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,680
你要多一些微笑  你只笑了4次
You need to smile more. You only smiled four times.

306
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,720
是吗  真的吗
Is that right? Really?

307
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,180
如果你多笑笑  选票会上涨23%
Voters respond 23% more favorably to full-teeth smiles.

308
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,980
那竖大拇指呢
Yeah. How about thumbs up, huh?

309
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,020
如果你竖一个大拇指的话  可以上涨16%
Sixteen percent better if you give them a single.

310
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,360
如果双手竖大拇指的话  可以上涨38%
Thirty-eight percent if you shoot them the double.

311
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,620
我怎么觉得  自己是在浪费时间呢
Why do I get the feeling like I'm wasting my time here?

312
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,480
我到底能不能赢
Am I gonna win, or not?

313
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,810
因为这简直就是浪费时间
'Cause this seems like a waste of time.

314
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,450
你请我就是为了赢得选票  你会赢的
You hired me to win. You're gonna win.

315
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,450
带上这个  为什么  我已经穿了
Put this on. Why? I'm already dressed.

316
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,990
你好吗  给
How you doing? Here.

317
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,700
我要给流浪汉做东西吃吗
Whoa, I gotta feed the hobos?

318
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,370
别说"流浪汉"  叫"游荡者"
Don't say "hobos." Say "bums."

319
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,040
由于某种原因  大家都认为
For some crazy reason, everybody thinks

320
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,620
你是个富有的杰出人物  不像普通人那么好相处
you're a rich elitist that can't relate to regular people.

321
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,330
于是  牛津大学的高才女  要告诉我怎么赢得选举
So, the girl from Oxford is trying to tell me how to keep it real.

322
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,040
我告诉你  你要是想赢得选举
I'm telling you if you want a chance at this,

323
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,710
你要记住你是从哪里来的
you're gonna have to remember where you came from.

324
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,210
好了吗  盖茨比
Okay, Gatsby?

325
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,260
用食物恭维他们  不过不是很多
Compliment them on the food, but not too much.

326
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,050
我不会吃的  你要吃这些食物
I ain't eating this food. You're gonna eat the food.

327
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,300
你要喜欢这些食物  但是不要爱上它们  明白吗
And you're gonna like it, but you're not gonna love it, okay?

328
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,100
我不想看起来像个拉皮条的
We don't want to seem like we're pandering.

329
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,520
我不吃流浪汉的食物  好了  很好
I don't eat hobo food. All right. That's good.

330
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,850
大家好  你们饿了吗
How we doing, folks? Starving?

331
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,400
你晚上睡得怎样
How do you sleep at night?

332
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,400
有丝绸床单  都还得吃安眠药
Silk sheets and Ambien.

333
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,110
快看看这些俊男靓女
Look at all these handsome faces!

334
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,820
给你  好了
There you go. All right.

335
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,530
给你  上帝保佑你
And here we go. God bless.

336
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,990
我猜你从来都不吃土豆泥  斯塔克斯先生
Bet you never had mashed potatoes, Mr. Stacks.

337
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,750
怎么可能
Are you kidding me?

338
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,330
我奶奶曾经是  皇后区最好的土豆泥厨师
Why, my grandmother made some of the best mashed potatoes in Queens.

339
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,500
我就是从那儿来的  出生和成长都在那
You know, that's where I'm from. Born and raised.

340
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,340
我一天当中  大部分时间都在操场上度过
On the playground's where I spent most of my days.

341
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,510
你看这个
And look at this.

342
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,930
没什么特别的  一点也不可怕  你看
It's not amazing, but it ain't terrible. Look at this.

343
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,180
噎到了
Went down the wrong pipe.

344
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,770
这太恶心了
This is disgusting.

345
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,570
太难吃了
Look, it's terrible.

346
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,030
天啊  你就像个小孩子
Oh, God. You're a child.

347
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,540
你们觉得刚刚进展如何
Well, how do you guys think that went?

348
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,760
纳什  你也看到了
Nash, you saw it.

349
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,160
要是你不在我手下做事  你会投我吗
Would you vote for me if you didn't work for me?

350
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,460
不会的  先生
No, sir.

351
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,670
谢谢你这么诚实  你被解雇了
Thank you for your honesty. You're fired.

352
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,170
速度真快
That didn't take long.

353
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,920
而且  新闻也发布出来了
And there are already parodies.

354
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,760
土豆泥  土豆泥
Mashed potatoes Mashed potatoes

355
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,970
土豆泥  皇后区的土豆泥
Mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes In Queens

356
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,510
这就是为什么中国会赢的原因  不是的
See, this is why China's winning. Not really.

357
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,890
也许这会因祸得福
Maybe this is a blessing in disguise.

358
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
因为这表明你可以做市长  但不表明你应该做市长
Just because you can run for mayor, doesn't mean that you should.

359
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,940
我们已经讨论过了  当市长的经历
We already discussed this is great for my profile.

360
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,150
对公司的成长很有帮助
It's going to grow the company.

361
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,240
再说了  这个城市需要我
Plus, the city needs me.

362
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,490
好吧  放松点  蝙蝠侠
All right. Take it easy, Batman.

363
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,820
你的所有员工  都是这么跟你说话的吗
You let all your employees talk to you like this?

364
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,240
那些让我赚几十亿的人可以这样
The ones that make me billions, I do.

365
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,790
你让我当上市长  你想怎么说都行
You make me mayor, you can say anything you want.

366
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,910
嘿
Hey!

367
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,750
不是吧  又来了
Oh, no. Not again.

368
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,250
那是  怎么回事
Nash. Why we stopping?

369
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,920
抱歉  斯塔克斯先生  我会修好的
Sorry, Mr. Stacks. I'll fix it.

370
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,930
下一个
Next!

371
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,190
我想看看我的资料  谢谢
I'd like to get my records please.

372
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,520
你要填表格  编号是4380
You'll need DOH form number 4380...

373
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,610
78
7-8.

374
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,450
还有43美元  55分
And $43 and... 55 cents.

375
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,240
还有父母或监护人的
And an application signed by a parent or a...

376
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,950
签名
Guardian. Bam.

377
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,090
都在这了
It's all there.

378
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,890
你打算就这样一直盯着我吗
Are you going to stare at me the whole time?

379
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,970
抱歉
Sorry.

380
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,490
下一个  你能帮我读一下吗  我太紧张了
Next! Can you read it? I'm too nervous.

381
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,240
"安妮·班尼特  被遗弃在26区外
"Annie Bennett. Abandoned outside 26th Precinct.

382
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,250
估计遗弃年龄为4岁
"Age estimate at time of abandonment, four years.

383
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,420
现处于家庭寄养  无其他信息"
"Placed in state foster care. No further data."

384
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,210
"无其他信息"  是什么意思
What does "no further data" mean?

385
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,460
意思是你的信息只有这么多  抱歉  亲爱的
That's all there is to know about you. Sorry, honey.

386
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,590
没关系  我会想办法的
It's okay. I'll figure it out.

387
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,870
The sun'II come out tomorrow

388
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,080
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

389
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,210
There'II be sun

390
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,050
Just thinkin' about tomorrow

391
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,510
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow

392
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,720
'Til there's none

393
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,890
When I'm stuck with a day

394
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,640
That's gray, and lonely

395
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,320
I just stick out my chin and grin

396
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,150
And say, oh

397
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,990
快点  爸爸
Faster, Daddy!

398
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,620
The sun'II come out tomorrow

399
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,410
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

400
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,750
Come what may

401
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,670
Tomorrow, tomorrow

402
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,710
I love you, tomorrow

403
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,090
You're always a day away!

404
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,570
When I'm stuck with a day

405
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,110
That's gray, and lonely

406
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,490
I just stick out my chin and grin

407
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,620
And say, oh

408
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,420
The sun'II come out tomorrow

409
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,880
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

410
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,720
Come what may

411
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,720
Tomorrow, tomorrow

412
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,510
I love you, tomorrow

413
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,980
You're always a day away!

414
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,900
Tomorrow, tomorrow

415
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,570
I love you, tomorrow

416
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,150
You're always a day

417
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,160
Away!

418
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,420
抓住它  快抓住它
Get it! Get it!

419
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,800
快点  嘿
Come on! Hey!

420
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,170
扔点东西过去
Throw something at it!

421
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,720
扔罐头
Throw the can!

422
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,010
嘿  站住  别管闲事
Hey! Stop! Mind your own business!

423
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,430
怎么了
What's going on?

424
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
我不知道  我不是机修工
I don't know. I'm not a chemist.

425
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,600
这个引擎还在试验阶段
Jimmy Neutron here had me throw this experimental engine in.

426
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,440
这表明了他爱护环境
It shows that he cares about the environment.

427
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,440
这是他具有前瞻性的想法
You know, that he's forward-thinking.

428
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,630
太好了  有人来拍照了
Oh, great. Here they come with the pictures.

429
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,740
我们得让她走  这太奇怪了
We gotta distract her. Something whimsical.

430
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,860
我去找树叶
Let's get into a leaf fight!

431
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,570
女士
Ma'am.

432
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,030
好  我来叫车
Okay, okay. I'm gonna call a car.

433
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,780
嘿  我走路回去
Hey! I'm gonna go walk.

434
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,120
什么
What?

435
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,580
他要去哪里  我想一个人静一静
Where's he going? I wanna be alone.

436
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,210
我们没有时间了  我知道要怎么走
We don't really have time. I know how to walk down the street!

437
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,710
我把方位发给你
I'll text you directions!

438
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,920
不用
Don't need them.

439
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,540
这都是你的错  别激动
This is all your fault. Take it easy, pantsuit.

440
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,550
还有你  抱歉
And, you... I'm sorry.

441
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,220
嘿  斯塔克斯  你的手机话费快害死我了
Hey, Stacks! Your phone bill's killing me, bro!

442
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,720
抓住它  我说了  站住
Get it! I told you to stop!

443
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,480
再快点
Try to hit it!

444
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,820
别追它了
Leave it alone!

445
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,900
嘿
Hey!

446
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,820
好了  踢它  快踢它  住手
All right, kick it! Kick it! Stop!

447
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,290
别动它  看它多害怕
Leave it alone! See how scared it is!

448
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
别管
Leave it...

449
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,910
你还是管好自己吧  小鬼  你没事吧
Watch where you're going, kid! Are you okay?

450
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,920
我们快走  你差点就被压过去了
Let's get out of here! You could've got run over.

451
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,210
抱歉  别抱歉  你要小心点
Sorry. Don't be sorry. You be careful.

452
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,590
你为什么要跑  因为我赶时间
Why're you running? Gets me to places quicker.

453
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,260
小孩子  有细菌的小孩子
Little kids. Kids with germs.

454
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,940
图书馆怎么样
How was the library?

455
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,230
深受教育
Educational.

456
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,900
我也要教育一下你
Well, I have some more education for you.

457
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,650
我和检察员说  我不想再收养你了
I told the inspector I don't wanna foster you anymore.

458
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,280
下个星期  你就要成为别人的麻烦了
As of next week, you're somebody else's problem.

459
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,700
那他说了是谁吗
Did they say who?

460
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,830
那就不是谁了  而是什么
Not a who, sweetie. A what.

461
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,290
收留所
Group home.

462
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,370
好吧
Okay.

463
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,710
也许那样能教你怎么管住你的嘴
Maybe that'll teach you to stop running your mouth.

464
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,340
新手机有什么特点
So, where are we with our new phones?

465
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,480
我们的电池  待机时间超过150小时
Well, we've got the battery up to 150 hours.

466
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,300
那还不到一个星期
That's not a week.

467
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,310
我说了要待机一个星期的  格蕾丝  我还特地说过的
I said I need the charge to last a week, Grace. Specifically.

468
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,840
很不幸  目前  手机会烧伤人们的手
At the moment, unfortunately, the phone is burning up in people's hands.

469
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,940
什么
What?

470
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,060
这就是我想说的  妈妈  他跟我说  她
That's what I told Mom. And she says to me, she...

471
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,980
你烫到我了
You burned me!

472
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,240
别担心  她签了弃权声明
Don't worry. She signed a waiver.

473
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,860
你烫到我了
You burned me!

474
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,900
什么情况
What up, Guy-O?

475
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,490
你的支持率提升了5%
You're up. Five points in the polls.

476
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,160
真的吗  他们喜欢向流浪汉呕吐吗
Really? They liked that he vomited on a homeless man?

477
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,360
不是  格蕾丝
No, Grace.

478
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,870
他们喜欢他救了一个差点被货车撞到的小女孩
They liked the fact that he saved a little girl from getting hit by a van.

479
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,080
有人拍下来了  把他放在网上  来看看吧
Some guy recorded it, put it on the Internet. Check it out.

480
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,170
"我是个小女孩  没有看路
"I'm a little girl who doesn't see where I'm going.

481
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,590
你看  跌倒了
"Well, look!

482
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,840
未来的纽约市长  救了我的命"
I bumped into the future mayor of New York who just saved my life!"

483
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,340
这太棒了  威廉
This is fantastic, Will.

484
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,300
我告诉你  恕我直言  这是你有史以来
I'm telling you. It's the most human thing you've done

485
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,930
做的最人道的事  不足挂齿
this entire campaign, all due respect. None taken.

486
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,600
你怎么没告诉我  你救了一个小女孩  你什么也没说
You didn't tell me you saved a little girl. You didn't tell me anything.

487
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
就像蜘蛛侠一样
Like Batman.

488
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,930
听着  你要利用这一点
Hey, listen to me. You gotta capitalize on this.

489
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,470
那当然  你要请她过来吃饭
Of course we do. You invite her to lunch.

490
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,650
不行  看看她怎么样
No. See how she's doing.

491
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,360
拍几张照片  媒体就爱吃这一套
Snap a few pics. The press'II eat this up.

492
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,110
我们认识她吗  这才是最重要的
Do we know who she is? That's the best part.

493
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,780
她是黑人区收养的孩子
She's a foster kid from Harlem.

494
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,950
你听到我说什么了吗  她是孤儿  黑人区的
Did you hear what I said? Foster kid! Harlem!

495
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,860
你眼部的血管都鼓起来了
Your undereye vein is bulging.

496
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,020
我会找到她的  不要  我让格蕾丝去找她
I'm gonna go get her. No. I'm gonna let Grace go get her.

497
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,410
什么  为什么  什么  这个主意太糟糕了
What? Why? What? That's a terrible idea!

498
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,930
那你想让这个人
Do you actually want 5-hour Energy to go over there

499
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,540
过去吓坏这个小女孩吗
and scare this little child?

500
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,480
我都不知道是怎么回事  格蕾丝  拜托
I don't even know what this is about. Grace, please.

501
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,370
就当为了我  格蕾丝
For me, Grace. Please.

502
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,880
谢谢  威廉  让我去黑人区吧
Thank you. Will, let me go to Harlem.

503
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,800
拜托  别让她去  去黑人区  你会被爆菊的
Please. Don't send her. They will whoop your ass in Harlem.

504
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,420
别关掉  谢谢
Don't shut me off. Thank you.

505
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,710
别关掉
Don't shut me off!

506
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,800
你好
Yeah.

507
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,010
是科琳·汉尼根吗
Is that Colleen Hannigan?

508
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,980
我想进去和你谈谈  你照顾的一个小孩的情况
I was wanting to talk to you about a girl in your care.

509
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,360
安妮
Annie.

510
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,240
是威廉·斯塔克斯叫我来的  他想请安妮共进午餐
I work for William Stacks and he would love to take Annie out for lunch.

511
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
为什么
Why?

512
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,240
他们昨天撞到了  她没跟你说吗
They ran into each other yesterday. She didn't tell you?

513
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
没有
No.

514
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,250
昨天晚上  我们没有时间好好谈话
We didn't have a chance to have our girl-talk jawbone last night.

515
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,840
安妮
Annie!

516
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,090
你是说他撞到她了
So you said he ran into her?

517
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,430
因为我注意到她的脖子  好像有点僵硬
'Cause I noticed that her neck did seem a little whiplash-y.

518
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,260
我们非常乐意  捐助你选的机构
We are happy to make a donation to the charity of your choice.

519
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,770
天啊  那选择太多了
Gosh! There's so many to choose from.

520
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,020
是的  比如  拯救鲸鱼机构
There is. Let's see, Save the Whales, of course.

521
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,860
净水组织  没有干净的水  鲸鱼怎么生存
And Clean Water, but you can't have whales without water.

522
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,310
天啊  你知道吗
Gosh. You know what?

523
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,780
你把现金给我就可以了  我来帮你分配
Just make it out to "cash." I'll divvy it up.

524
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,280
太好了  安妮
Perfect. Annie!

525
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,780
她就像个天使
You know, she's such an angel.

526
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,530
可遇而不可求  我们把她当亲生女儿看待
We don't inherit the Earth, we borrow it from our children.

527
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,830
你们感情真好
It's a lovely sentiment.

528
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,330
她来了
There she is.

529
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,540
嗨  安妮  我是格蕾丝
Hi, Annie. I'm Grace.

530
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,870
我是斯塔克斯先生的下属  就是昨天撞你的那位先生
I work for Mr. Stacks, the gentleman that you ran into yesterday.

531
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,170
他想请你共进午餐
He'd like to invite you to lunch.

532
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,170
我保证  不会耽误你太多时间的
I promise we won't keep you long.

533
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,000
你让我待多久都可以
You can keep me as long as you want.

534
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,720
不会吧  这是真的吗
No way! Is this for real?

535
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,140
这辆车跟地铁一样大  你太幸运了
This car's as big as a subway! You're so lucky!

536
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,310
真不可思议
It's incredible.

537
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,310
我的天啊  我也想上车  我的天啊
Oh, my gosh. I want that! Oh, my gosh!

538
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,230
想吃什么都可以
Help yourself to whatever you want.

539
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,570
不是吧  真的吗
No way. Really?

540
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,820
当然
Sure.

541
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,070
给我这个  我要这个  噢  我的天啊
Give me this! Give me this! I want this! Oh, my God!

542
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,950
我要那个  我要那个  太过瘾了  我的天啊
I want that one! I want that! This is crazy! My God!

543
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,240
小孩这么喜欢吃糖啊
Kids love candy, huh?

544
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,950
嘿  安妮  或许我应该跟你一起去
Hey, Annie! Maybe I should come with you

545
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,370
确保一切进行的更顺利  对吧
and make sure that everything's USDA Grade A awesome, huh?

546
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
我可以的  谢谢
I'm good. Thanks.

547
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,840
再见  安妮
Bye, Annie!

548
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,550
再见  再见
Bye! Later.

549
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,010
谢谢  我的天啊
Thanks! Oh, my gosh.

550
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,920
嘿  美女
Hey, gorgeous!

551
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,800
有个出名的孩子  感觉如何
How does it feel to have a famous kid?

552
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,930
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

553
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,850
这是安妮
It's Annie!

554
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,140
你的安妮
Your Annie!

555
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,060
令晚想和我约会吗  我买了跳舞的裤子
Hey, you wanna go out tonight? I got my dance pants on.

556
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,150
我的人格还没这么低
I haven't hit that rock bottom yet.

557
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,360
我就喜欢你这么对我说话
I love it when you throw me shade!

558
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,030
给  卢  没事  她会喜欢我的
Here, Lou. It's okay. She likes me.

559
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,820
天啊  这太好吃了
Oh, my God, this is so good.

560
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,620
斯塔克斯先生  想和你合影  可以吗
Mr. Stacks would like to take some pictures with you, if that's all right.

561
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,290
应该可以  为什么  人们想知道你没事
I guess so. Why? People wanna know that you're okay.

562
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,540
哪些人  所有看到新闻的人
What people? Everybody who saw that.

563
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,130
我的头发蓬的好大
My hair's gigantic.

564
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,050
你想收听什么节目都可以  我可以听一下脱口秀吗
We can listen to whatever you like. Can you put on talk radio?

565
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,220
你确定不想听音乐吗
Are you sure you don't wanna listen to music?

566
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,180
我喜欢听脱口秀  可以让我平静
I love talk radio. It calms me.

567
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,140
我也是  我小时候超爱听
So do I. I loved it when I was a little girl.

568
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,810
我曾经认为  他们都是我的朋友
I used to think that they were all my friends.

569
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:07,900
抱歉  那听起来太伤感了
Sorry, that sounded very sad. Sorry.

570
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,070
我有很多朋友  不用担心我
I have a lot of friends, so don't worry about me.

571
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,570
我的工作很忙  真的  我本来可以交更多朋友的
I mean, so I work a lot. I do. And I could have some more friends.

572
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,610
但是你真正需要的朋友  又有几个呢
But how many friends do you really need?

573
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,550
有时我父母问起我
I mean, if you were my parents asking me,

574
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,700
"你过得充实  幸福吗  格蕾丝"
"Are you fulfilled and are you happy, Grace?"

575
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,200
这完全跑题了
That's a whole different conversation, right?

576
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,410
我们还是不说这个了
But we're not having that conversation.

577
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,080
老实说  你没这个资格  问我朋友多不多  所以
And, frankly, it's really not your position to ask me that at all. So...

578
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,670
好吧
Okay.

579
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,470
她来了  我们的小孤儿安妮
There she is. Our own Little Orphan Annie.

580
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,430
是收养的孩子
Foster kid.

581
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,770
她来了
She's here.

582
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:57,280
嘿  就是她  对吧  好了  我们开始吧
Hey, this is the one, right? All right. Let's get this.

583
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,200
等一下
Slow your roll.

584
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,780
你说  我们可以先吃饭吗  坐了很长时间的车
Excuse me? Can we eat first? It was a long drive.

585
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,000
好  快去
Yeah, yeah. Go, go.

586
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,080
好的  当然  我们先吃  我们有的是时间拍照
Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's eat. We got time for that.

587
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,330
好了
All right.

588
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,420
你昨天撞了我后  有什么感受
So, how are you feeling from yesterday?

589
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,340
别演戏了
So, what's the hustle?

590
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,800
你怎么这么想  我没有演戏
What makes you think there's a hustle? There's no hustle.

591
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,970
快  快
Come on, come on.

592
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,180
我10岁了  我不是傻瓜
I'm 10. I'm not an idiot.

593
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,020
我从来没说你是
I never said you were...

594
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,230
什么傻瓜  或10岁
an idiot. Or 10.

595
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,650
事实是  我还不知道你多大
Truth of the matter is, I don't know how old you are.

596
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,570
10岁  好  我们知道  你不是傻瓜
Ten. Well, now we know that you're not an idiot.

597
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,280
但是还有很多人
But there are a lot of people out there

598
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,740
看了我救你的照片
that are and when they saw that photo of us,

599
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,370
他们都觉得  我会是个好的市长
they thought that I would make a great mayor.

600
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,870
为什么
Why?

601
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,530
为什么  因为我是
Why? Because I'm a...

602
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,740
我是个富人  我救了一个孤儿
I'm a rich guy. I saved an orphan.

603
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,580
我不是孤儿  我是被收养的孩子
I'm not an orphan, I'm a foster kid.

604
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,870
而且你并没有救我
And you didn't save me.

605
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,540
我没有救你  不是我把你从火车前抱起来的吗
I didn't save you? I didn't just push you out of the way of a van?

606
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,090
要不我把那辆车找回来  完成他所做的
Why don't I call that van back and have him finish up what he...

607
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,710
你知道吗
You know what?

608
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,010
越多人看到我们在一起  我的竞选就越有可能
The more we're seen together, the better it is for my campaign.

609
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,050
等下  市长就是这么被选出来的吗
Wait. That's how a mayor gets elected?

610
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,100
是的  很出入意料吧
Yes. lnsane, isn't it?

611
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,600
要是我跟你一起住的话  那你不是可以当总统了
I bet if I moved in with you, you'd become president.

612
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,520
跟我一起住
Move in with me?

613
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,520
这不是什么派对
This is not that kind of party.

614
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,980
好了  好了
That's it. That's it. That's it.

615
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,070
我觉得他有话想跟你说
I think he wants to tell you something.

616
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,450
其实这个主意不错  安妮搬过来跟你一起住
Actually, that's not a bad idea. Annie coming to live with you.

617
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,610
什么  什么
What? What?

618
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,030
据我所知  你住的地方很拥挤
From what I understand, it's very crowded where you live.

619
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,620
你想不想住一个宽阔的地方  你可能会喜欢的地方
How'd you like some more space? Is that something that you might like?

620
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,280
跟一个世界首富一起住
Living with the richest guy in the world?

621
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,330
这个我喜欢
Yeah, that's something I might like.

622
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,880
太好了  你在搞什么鬼
Great. Perfect. Guy. What are you talking about?

623
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,170
听我说  只要住几周就行了
Listen to me. It'll only be for a few weeks.

624
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,880
然后她就可以回去了
Then she'll go back to wherever she came from.

625
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:43,220
领养一个孩子  马上可以赢得15%的选票
Taking in a foster kid, that's an automatic 15 point jump in the polls.

626
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,720
我保证  一你要我扮演奶爸
Guaranteed. You want me to play Daddy?

627
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,930
很简单的  我只需要一日三餐和一张床
It's easy. All I need is a bed and meals.

628
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,350
其他你什么都不用管
You don't have to do anything else.

629
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,440
而且一周你还可以拿到157美元
And you get $157 a week.

630
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,360
我像那种需要157美元一周的人吗
Do I look like I need $157 a week?

631
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,400
每个人都不会拒绝一周157美元的
Everybody needs an extra $157 a week.

632
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,000
你不会真的想这样吧
You're not really thinking about doing this?

633
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,740
你想跟我合影  对吧
You want photos, right?

634
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,610
我相信要合影  还有很多更简单的办法
I'm sure there's easier ways to get photos.

635
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,370
那绝对不是跟我拍
Not with me in them.

636
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
微笑
Smile.

637
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,660
斯塔克斯先生
Mr. Stacks!

638
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,290
你真的想这样吗  没错  我要每个人都知道
Are you really doing this? Yeah, won't even know she's there.

639
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,000
就像养了一只乌龟一样  她可不是省油的灯
It's like having a turtle. I wonder if she has her shots.

640
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,590
午餐怎么样  你叫什么名字
How was your lunch? What's your name?

641
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,630
她叫安妮  她要过来跟斯塔克斯先生住一段时间
Her name is Annie, and she'll be staying with Mr. Stacks for awhile.

642
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,010
他打算领养你吗
He's going to adopt you?

643
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:29,430
没有  我有父母  这只是暂时的  如果通过批准的话
No, no, no. I have parents. This is just temporary. If he gets approved.

644
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,850
现在怎么办  下一个
What now? Next.

645
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,440
我需要申请临时监护人
I need a temporary guardian approval, please.

646
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,860
这需要6周的时间  还要填写表格
There is a six-week waiting period and you need form NYS 84-...

647
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,280
亲爱的上帝
Sweet Lord.

648
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,490
嗨
Hi.

649
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,890
我通常都不做实地考察的
You know, I don't normally do the site visits,

650
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,710
但是看你这么喜欢这个可爱的安妮
but I've taken such a liking to young Annie.

651
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,540
有时候我会忘记自己  为什么要这么做
I forget sometimes, you know, why I got into this.

652
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,460
就是为了存档
It's for my files.

653
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,550
监护人是否"有能力提供一个合适的住所"
So, does the guardian have "adequate income to provide basic shelter"?

654
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,770
我只是按流程办事
I'm just gonna go ahead and check that box.

655
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,350
请进
Come on in.

656
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,570
...每股95美元的现金和股票
...about $95 per share in cash and stock.

657
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,610
这绝对是个爆炸性的新闻...
...detonated an explosive while fire...

658
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,830
哇  是啊  哇
Whoa. Oh, yeah, whoa.

659
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,460
嘿  这里有临时监护人伙伴吗
Hey, is there a co-temporary guardian?

660
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,920
没有  那你想要找一个临时监护人伙伴呜
No. Would you like a co-temporary guardian?

661
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,880
我带他们四处转转吧  你专心工作
Why don't I take these guys on a tour, and you can get back to work.

662
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,130
这个主意不错
Best idea of the day.

663
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,300
我跟你一起去
I'll come with you.

664
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,220
威廉  威廉
Will. Will, Will!

665
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,140
好了  国家要求  房屋至少有
Okay, so the state says that you must have at least

666
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,600
一处水源
one water source in...

667
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,270
没问题
Check.

668
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,400
还有一个窗户  也没问题
And a window that's... Okay.

669
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,030
10个人至少要有一张椅子
And then at least one chair per 10 persons.

670
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,740
我觉得这个星际飞船应该算了  我再看看
And I think the Starship Enterprise is gonna count. I'm gonna check that box.

671
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,530
这是怎么做到的
How does it do this?

672
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,910
这是智能家居
It's a smart house.

673
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,040
它能够识别你的声音  并作出相应调整
So, it recognizes your voice and then adjusts itself accordingly.

674
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,660
就像一个朋友
It's like a friend.

675
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,760
我把它当作朋友
I consider it a friend.

676
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,920
不过我有真正的朋友  他们不是机器人哦
But I have real friends that aren't robots.

677
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,220
我们还是别谈这个话题了
Let's forget this conversation

678
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,800
我们继续先前的话题  重头开始
and the previous conversation and start afresh.

679
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,720
明白吗  太好了
Got that? Great.

680
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,430
现在我要录下你的声音  安妮  你会被记录到系统中
I'm gonna record your voice now, Annie, and it'll be in the system.

681
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,140
对着这个说几句话
So, just say something into this.

682
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,350
我要说什么  任何事都可以
What should I say? Anything.

683
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,560
我觉得我会喜欢这里的
I think I'm gonna like it here.

684
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,730
成功了
Got it.

685
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,280
太好了  这都听你的了
Great. It's all yours.

686
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,240
你试试看  我等下再过来
Have a go. And I'll be back.

687
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,240
女士
Ma'am?

688
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,740
抱歉  你不能进去
Excuse me. You are not allowed to go in there.

689
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,200
这里太棒了  这些是卤素灯泡吗
This is very nice. Are those halogen bulbs?

690
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,330
女士  这个水槽比我家还大
Ma'am. This sink is bigger than my entire country.

691
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,720
我觉得我会喜欢这里的
I think I'm gonna like it here.

692
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,270
我觉得我会喜欢这里的
I think I'm gonna like it

693
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,600
我确定我会喜欢这里的
I'm sure I'm gonna like it

694
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,400
我觉得我会喜欢这里的
I think I'm gonna like it here

695
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,940
那么  想好了就来吧
So, think it and it shall appear

696
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,740
我觉得我会喜欢这里的
I think I'm gonna like it here

697
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,950
因为它知道我想看什么
Because it knows just what you wanna see

698
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,120
等等  我觉得它想来见我
Wait, I think it and it comes to me?

699
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,630
这儿有架大钢琴可以弹
Here's something grand for you to play

700
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,090
等下  我昨天还没有这些的
Wait, I couldn't do that yesterday

701
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,550
我觉得我会喜欢这里的
I think I'm gonna like it here

702
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,350
想不喜欢都难  亲爱的
It's very hard not to, my dear

703
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:04,430
是的  我觉得我会喜欢这里的
Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here Yes,

704
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,940
是的  我觉得我会喜欢这里的
yes, I think I'm gonna like it here

705
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,860
我觉得我会喜欢这里的  我觉得我会喜欢这里的
Think I'm gonna like it here Think I'm gonna like it here

706
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,410
我觉得我会喜欢这里的
I think I'm gonna like it here

707
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,250
是的  我觉得我会喜欢这里的
Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here Yes,

708
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,540
是的  我觉得我会喜欢这里的
yes, I think I'm gonna like it here

709
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,750
我觉得我会喜欢这里的  我觉得我会喜欢这里的
Think I'm gonna like it here Think I'm gonna like it here

710
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,540
看
Look!

711
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,380
是自动温控泳池
It knows the temp you're comfy in.

712
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,970
太棒了  能教我游泳吗
That's great. Can it teach me to swim?

713
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,550
我们去请个教练  别怕
We'll get a coach, no need to fear.

714
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,850
我觉得我会喜欢这里的
I think I'm gonna like it here

715
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,600
水好冷
The water's cold!

716
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,770
曾经的梦
Everything you've ever dreamed

717
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,310
尽在指尖
Is at your fingertips

718
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,730
如果有你没梦到的
And if you haven't dreamed it yet

719
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,860
把它添入愿望清单
Add it to your wish list

720
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,740
这是斯塔克斯先生的房间吗
Is this Mr. Stacks' room?

721
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,580
不  安妮  这是你的房间
No, Annie, this is your room.

722
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,080
我的天啊
Sweet Lord.

723
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,880
我觉得我会喜欢的
I think I'm gonna like it

724
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,840
我觉得我会喜欢的
I know I'm gonna like it

725
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,970
我知道你会喜欢的
I know you're gonna like it

726
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,260
你肯定会喜欢的
Damn right, you're gonna like it

727
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,140
我觉得我会喜欢这的
I think I'm gonna like it here!

728
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,210
是的  我觉得我会喜欢的
Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here Yes,

729
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,570
是的  我觉得我会喜欢的
yes, I think I'm gonna like it here

730
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:35,240
我觉得我会喜欢的  我觉得我会喜欢的
Think I'm gonna like it here Think I'm gonna like it here

731
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,950
我觉得我会喜欢的
I think I'm gonna like it here

732
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:41,020
是的  我觉得我会喜欢的
Yes, yes, I think I'm gonna like it here Yes,

733
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,450
是的  我觉得我会喜欢的
yes, I think I'm gonna like it here

734
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,710
我觉得我会喜欢的  我觉得我会喜欢的
Think I'm gonna like it here Think I'm gonna like it here

735
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,210
是的  是的
Yes, yes!

736
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,630
衣橱超级大  大到我还以为是客厅
The closet was so big, I thought it was the living room.

737
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,630
真的吗  那客厅有多大
Really? How big was the living room?

738
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,470
就像康涅狄格州那么大  我的天啊
I thought it was Connecticut. Oh, my gosh.

739
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,680
他人好吗  挺好的
Is he nice? I think so.

740
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,270
只是他自己还不知道这点
He just doesn't know it yet.

741
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,730
我们会想你的  安妮
We're gonna miss you, Annie.

742
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,190
我才不会想你  这里终于清净了
I'm not. Finally can get a little space in here.

743
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,730
当你们想我了  你们都可以给我打电话
Well, whenever you miss me, all you gotta do is call.

744
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,820
什么  不会吧
Bam, bam. What? Are you serious?

745
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,360
斯塔克斯手机
Bam. Stacks phones?

746
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,900
你也有份  佩珀  我知道你会想我的
Even one for you, Pepper. I know you're gonna miss me. Bam.

747
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,030
没有盖子啊  垃圾
No case, huh? This is janky.

748
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,710
嘿  威廉·斯塔克斯先生
Hey, Mr. Will Stacks.

749
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,670
我是不是应该叫你"准市长"
Or should I say Soon-To-Be-Mr.Mayor?

750
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,840
不用  谢谢  我在等人
No, thank you. We're just waiting on someone.

751
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,760
我可没想找什么临时伙伴
I'm not looking for temporary companionship.

752
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,010
不是嫌弃你
Not judging you.

753
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,050
上帝为我们每个人指明了道路
God has a path for us all.

754
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,640
你的道路就是离这车远一点  什么
Your path should be away from the car. What?

755
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,140
女士  麻烦离车远点
Ma'am, wanna move away from the car, please?

756
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,640
你竟敢
How dare you...

757
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,310
不是吧  你想喷我
Oh, really, you're gonna spray me?

758
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,600
你以为你比我好吗
You think you're better than me?

759
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,020
是吗  你以为你比我好吗
Is that what it is? You think you're better than me?

760
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,230
没错  我确实比你好
I do. I do think I'm better than you.

761
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,940
嘿  汉尼根小姐  什么事
Hey, Miss Hannigan. What?

762
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,070
我只想感谢你为我付出的一切
I just wanna thank you for everything you've done for me.

763
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,000
你以为你的生活就像童话吗
You think your life is a fairy tale?

764
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,240
根本就没有"从此过上了幸福的生活"
There is no happily ever after.

765
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,410
幸福就像昙花一现
And the worst thing is to get a little taste of something good

766
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,870
绝对不会持久的
'cause it never lasts.

767
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,870
在那之后  你的生活就不再是
And then all you can taste from then on out is

768
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,290
那么幸福了
not that taste.

769
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,130
她想说什么  让她说就好了  记住没
Just let her talk when she gets like this, remember?

770
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,420
闭嘴
Shut up!

771
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,590
科琳·汉尼根  上我微博上赞我
Colleen Hannigan! H-bomb! Like me on Facebook!

772
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,720
我不喜欢黑人区的人  我为什么要去微博上赞你
I don't like you in Harlem. Why would I like you on Facebook?

773
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,560
快进去  小鬼们
Come on, rats, let's go!

774
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,220
快进去  再见  安妮
Inside! Bye, Annie.

775
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,270
再见
Bye.

776
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,100
怎么回事  不用担心
What was that? Don't worry about it.

777
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,150
好了  纳什  我们走吧
All right, Nash, we can take off.

778
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,980
走不了  前面有辆卡车
I can't, there's a truck.

779
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,360
注意你的左边  纳什  注意你的左边  淡定
Bogey on your left, Nash, bogey on your left. Steady.

780
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,280
不用  谢谢  我们不找什么伙伴
No, thank you. I'm not looking for companionship.

781
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
这附近的人是怎么了  不是的  他是卢
What is it with this neighborhood? No, that's Lou.

782
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,160
你认识她  他是男的
You know her name? It's a he.

783
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,830
嘿  姑娘  嘿  我有东西要送给你
Hey, girl. Hey. I got you something.

784
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,100
不用  谢谢  那都是坑人的东西
No, thanks. Those things are evil.

785
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,330
它会窃取你的私人信息
They steal your private information

786
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,670
这样的大企业就可以监控你  然后榨干你的灵魂
so that big business can spy on you and crush your soul.

787
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,880
真的吗
Really?

788
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,550
不过我还是替你感到高兴
I'm happy for you though, mija.

789
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:00,920
能够离开这里  保重  再见  卢
Getting off the block. Take care. Bye, Lou.

790
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,760
对她好点  斯塔克斯先生
Stay warm, Mr. Stacks.

791
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,300
抱歉  他只是不太喜欢你而已
Sorry. He just doesn't like you.

792
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,350
很多人不喜欢我  所以我才这么做
A lot of people don't like me. That's why we're doing this.

793
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,770
别担心  我有一张讨人喜欢的脸
Don't worry, I got a game face.

794
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,770
我们再拍些合影吧
Let's take some photos.

795
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,330
我的对手要有两个原因
My opponent wants to be mayor for two reasons.

796
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,540
第一  满足他的自大心理  第二  增加商业利益
To feed his ego, and bolster his business interests.

797
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,420
他现在却领养了一个女孩儿  拜托
And now he coincidentally takes in a foster kid? Come on.

798
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,220
别把我当傻子
Don't pee in my ear and tell me it's hot rain.

799
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,390
你觉得领养安妮  是一项政治谋划
Are you saying Annie is a political move?

800
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,560
我很好奇  他连狗都没养过
I'm surprised he hasn't gotten a dog yet.

801
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,480
我真的可以养一只吗
Are you sure I can have one?

802
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,190
不行  可以
No. Yes.

803
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,330
小孩喜欢狗  拜托
Look, kids love dogs. Come on,

804
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,450
在街上看到狗  他们都会
they see them on the street and they all go...

805
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,280
我说的对吗  狗狗
Am I right? Hello.

806
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,200
女人也是一样  狗狗
You know, women do the same thing. Hello.

807
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,080
你好啊
Hello.

808
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,750
那只怎么样
What about that one?

809

00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,660
我真不敢相信  萨卡纳竟然告诉他们了
I can't believe Sakana told on them.

946
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,640
那当然  你不会相信美人鱼的
Of course you can. You can't trust the fish people.

947
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,710
沃拉克警告过他们了
Gwarklark warned them.

948
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:57,000
我觉得她故意吓唬他们
I think she was bluffing.

949
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,000
不是  那只是个预示  说明还有下一部
Nah, it was a warning. They come back in the next movie.

950
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,380
还有下一部  还有4部
There's a next movie? There're four more.

951
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,970
闭嘴
Shut up!

952
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,970
哇  太赞了
Whoa! Cool!

953
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,850
我得回去工作了
I gotta get back to work.

954
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,140
你不留下来参加聚会吗
You can't stay for the party?

955
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,690
不能  我已经有两个小时没工作了
No. I haven't worked in two hours

956
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,350
我的下属肯定会以为我死了
and three of my men think I'm dead.

957
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,520
我还活着
I'm alive.

958
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,830
你已经工作的够多了
You've worked enough.

959
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,980
如果你的事业再高一点  就要撞到太阳了
If your building gets any taller it's gonna hit the sun.

960
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,990
你说服别人的方式真是奇怪
You got this crazy way of turning a no into a yes.

961
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:24,950
你是怎么做到的
How do you do that?

962
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:29,280
我觉得人们说"不"  的时候  他们只是害怕说"好"
I think when people say no, they're just really scared of saying yes.

963
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,330
好吧  我并不害怕  不行
Well, I'm not scared. No!

964
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,950
求你了  不行
Please! No!

965
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,660
求你了  好
Please. Yes.

966
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,540
太好了  走吧
Yes! Come on!

967
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,130
我不知道
Listen. I don't know.

968
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,590
好吧  太过瘾了
Well, okay. This is amazing.

969
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,290
斯塔克斯先生  威廉
Mr. Stacks! Will!

970
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,710
你竟然在这里待了这么久
I can't believe how long you've been here.

971
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,530
比赛我们就要迟到了
We're gonna be late for the Jets-Giants game.

972
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,130
你还要在仪式上扔硬币
You're doing the ceremonial coin flip.

973
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,420
还有一点  这两支队伍都是纽约的
And remember, they're both New York teams,

974
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:29,430
去还是不去  一样可以高兴或伤心的
so, heads or tails, you gotta be equally happy and sad.

975
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,470
你说得对
You're right.

976
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,050
你快去吧  我陪这些孩子
You go, I'll stay here with the kids.

977
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,390
你确定  是的
You sure? Yeah.

978
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,770
好了  快走吧
All right, come on, let's go.

979
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,190
怎么回事
What is that?

980
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,400
看  泰西
Look, Tessie!

981
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,320
我们可以再去一个地方吗
Can we make one more stop?

982
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,450
可以  别吵醒汉尼根了
Sure. Don't wake up Hannigan.

983
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,290
再见  再见  小美女们
Bye! Bye, girls!

984
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,920
你每周五都会来这里吗
You come here every Friday?

985
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,460
只有这天  他们才卖油煎酥饼
It's the only day they serve cannoli.

986
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,800
你只知道这一点吗
And that's all you've got to go on?

987
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:15,810
你还记得他们长什么样子吗
Do you think you'll remember what they look like?

988
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:17,850
我觉得我还记得
I think I'll just know.

989
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,460
你们怎么还没睡觉
What are you doing still up?

990
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,590
你们从哪儿拿的这些东西
Where did you get all of this stuff?

991
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,180
从哪儿拿的  从哪儿拿的
Where'd you get it? Where'd you get it?

992
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,470
我们和安妮去看电影了  我们还吃了糖果  喝了汽水
We went with Annie to the movies, and we got candy and soda,

993
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,970
我们还溜冰了  斯塔克斯先生太好了
and we went ice skating, and Mr. Stacks is so cool,

994
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,350
我还买了鱼人耳环
and I got fish earrings.

995
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,520
说得好  泰西
Nice, Tessie.

996
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,310
我忍不住这个秘密了  我买了鱼人耳环
I can't keep a secret. I got fish earrings.

997
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,480
包起来  送回去
Pack it up. It's going back.

998
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,980
为什么  因为这不是你们应得的
Why? Because you don't deserve it.

999
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,150
这就是我们应得的  是我们朋友给我们的
Yes, we do. It's from our friend.

1000
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,740
她不是你们的朋友  斯塔克斯先生也不是
She's not your friend. And neither is Mr. Stacks.

1001
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,570
他们都只是一群寄生虫  吸取你们的心血
They're all just a bunch of parasites who suck the life out of you

1002
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,950
等你不再优秀了  他们会寻找新的目标
and move on once you're not the shiny new object in the Factory anymore.

1003
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,200
你真讨厌
You're being mean.

1004
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,580
我在教育你们
I'm being educational!

1005
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,790
快收起来  你们太荒唐了
Now pack it up! You look ridiculous.

1006
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,840
我没有摔倒
I didn't fall.

1007
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,220
妈妈
Mama.

1008
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,270
小女孩儿  小女孩儿
Little girls, little girls

1009
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,190
她们随处可见
Everywhere I turn I can see them

1010
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,780
小女孩儿  小女孩儿
Little girls, little girls

1011
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,870
不管白天黑夜  不管吃饭睡觉  都能感受到她们
Night and day I eat, sleep and breathe them

1012
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,990
快滚开
Get out of here!

1013
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,250
我不该在这儿的
I should be anywhere but here

1014
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,210
私人飞机  舞台或者音乐电视
Private planes, on the stage or MTV

1015
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:12,630
在电视里的舞台上表演
But I find myself here at the snot house

1016
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,260
小鞋子  小袜子
Little shoes, little socks

1017
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,470
请杀了我吧  我说真的  杀了我吧
Please kill me. I'm serious, please kill me.

1018
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:19,560
我没有唱歌  我在请求
I'm not singing, I'm asking.

1019
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,680
我跟这些兔崽子  关在笼子里  我从缝隙里偷偷溜过
Locked in a cage with all the rats I've slipped through the cracks

1020
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:28,560
现在我卡在缝隙中  找不到回去的路
And now I'm stuck with the scraps And I can't seem to find my way back

1021
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,860
放我出去  放我出去
Get me out, get me out of here

1022
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,070
放她出去
Oh, get her out

1023
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,410
这些年来  我已经准备好当明星了
I'm ready for stardom after all these years

1024
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:40,370
我受够了这些小女孩
I'm done with little girls

1025
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:45,250
我想成为世上的重要人物
I wanna be someone in this world

1026
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:47,460
小女孩儿  小女孩儿
Little girls, little girls

1027
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,210
她们无处不在
Everywhere I turn I can see them

1028
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,720
小女孩儿  小女孩儿
Little girls, little girls

1029
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,970
不管白天黑夜  不管吃饭睡觉  都能感受到她们
Night and day I eat, sleep and breathe them

1030
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,220
快滚开
Get out of here!

1031
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,890
我和这些兔崽子  关在这里  我从缝隙里偷偷溜过
Locked in a cage with all the rats I've slipped through the cracks

1032
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,900
现在我被卡在缝隙中  找不到回去的路
And now I'm stuck with the scraps And I can't seem to find my way back

1033
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,070
放我出去  放我出去
Oh, get me out, get me out of here

1034
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,360
救救我吧
Oh, throw me a rope

1035
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,530
这些年  我已经准备好当明星了
I'm ready for stardom after all these years

1036
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,450
我受够了这些小女孩儿
I'm done with little girls

1037
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:27,410
我想成为世上的重要人物

1038
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,790
小女孩儿  小女孩儿
Little girls, little girls

1039
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,020
我的天啊  天籁之音
Oh, my God. That was beautiful.

1040
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,310
声音跟人一样美
Your voice matches your beauty.

1041
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,750
听起来就像教堂的钟声
You sound like a church bell,

1042
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,520
如果特别喜欢一个漂亮女人的话
if it was stuck on top of a beautiful woman,

1043
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,690
或者如果一个漂亮女人在教堂的钟声里
or if a beautiful woman was inside a church bell.

1044
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,190
并不是说你像教堂的钟  我不是这个意思
Not that you look like a church bell. That's not what I'm saying.

1045
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,530
如果你是教堂的钟  我一定会每天去教堂的
If you looked like a church bell, I'd go to church every day.

1046
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,610
什么
What?

1047
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,650
我给你买了一件T恤  你会喜欢的
I got you a T-shirt, and you're gonna love it.

1048
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,950

怎么了
What...

1050
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:16,510
你不喜欢这个颜色吗  还是不合尺寸  我店里还有很多
It's not your color? Not your size. I got more in the store.

1051
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,760
你知道我在说什么的  教堂钟声
You know what I'm talking about, the church bell, right?

1052
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:32,650
油煎酥饼  给你的美女朋友

谢谢
Thank you.

1054
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,900
抱歉  孩子  没事
Sorry, kid. It's okay.

1055
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:43,490
你可不可以  别告诉斯塔克斯吗  我不想麻烦他
Can you not tell Mr. Stacks about this? I don't want to bother him with it.

1056
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,740
好的
Sure.

1057
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:49,120
他把他的一生  无私的奉献给了纽约
He's worked selflessly his entire life for New York.

1058
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,750
最早在市中心学校工作
From his first job teaching in inner-city schools,

1059
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,750
其后的25年就职于议会
to his 25 year stint on the City Council...

1060
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,000
这是谁的声音  我不知道
Whose voice is that? I don't know.

1061
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,050
支持他的有"纽约时报"和"纽约邮报"
Endorsed by The New York Times, the New York Post,

1062
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,050
以及我  迈克尔•福克斯
and me, Michael J. Fox.

1063
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,930
迈克尔•福克斯  完了  我们完了
Michael J. Fox? It's over. We're finished.

1064
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,260
如果迈克尔•福克斯支持他  那我也会投票给他的
If Michael J. Fox endorses him, then I'll vote for him.

1065
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:09,520
听我说  迈克尔•福克斯没你想的那么厉害
Listen to me, Michael J. Fox is not as great a guy as you think.

1066
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,730
拜托  他可是个圣人
Oh, no, no. Come on, he's a saint.

1067
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:12,600
我听过这个磁带  算了吧  我不想听
I hear there's a tape. Forget it. I don't wanna hear it.

1068
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,100
你已经进入稳定阶段了  迈克尔•福克斯
You've plateaued. Michael J. Fox.

1069
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,270
注意  看着绿点
Pay attention. Follow the little green dot.

1070
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,730
那就是你  我看图表不需要什么绿点
That's you there. I don't need a pointer to read a graph.

1071
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,950
你看这个  安妮正在努力提升你  好吗
Well, read this. Annie's taken you as far as she can, okay?

1072
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,240
这还没有结束
But it's not over.

1073
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,460
你到底有多想要这个  没把握的事  我不做
How bad do you want this? I don't start things I can't win.

1074
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:26,990
你想做到什么程度
Well, how far are you willing to go?

1075
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:30,370
或者说  你想要我做到什么程度
Or should I say, how far do you want me to go?

1076
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,130
我花那么多钱请你  不是让你来问我这些问题的
I pay you a lot of money for you not to ask me those types of questions.

1077
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,340
好吗  盖伊
Okay, Guy-O?

1078
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,710
明白了  老大
Rat-a-tat-tat, message received, boss.

1079
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,500
早上好  给你做了早餐
Good morning. Made you breakfast.

1080
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,170
你给我做早餐了
You made me breakfast.

1081
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,090
嘿  我在想  你今天想跟我一起去工作吗
Hey, I was thinking maybe you would wanna go in to work with me today.

1082
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,010
好啊  答应了
Cool. That'd be cool?

1083
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,510
我去弄点喝的  好啊
I'll go make us drinks. All right.

1084
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,680
快点  趁热吃
Don't let your food get cold.

1085
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:36,810
好  这太好吃了
Okay. I won't. This is amazing.

1086
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,980
安妮  你真厉害
Annie, you really outdid yourself.

1087
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,860
安妮  你做的很成功
Annie, this is a triumph, honey.

1088
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,030
我像只狗一样  在吃你做的早餐
You got me eating this thing up like a dog.

1089
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,620
太好吃了  这是什么
This is good. What is it?

1090
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,490
辣椒  牛汁
Paprika, oregano.

1091
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,830
这又是什么  高达奶酪
What is... What is that, Gouda cheese?

1092
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,460
你想知道高达奶酪是什么吗  吃了就知道了
You wanna know what's Gouda? This breakfast.

1093
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,970
太赞了  直升机
Cool, a helicopter!

1094
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,300
是的
Yeah.

1095
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:11,720
要弯腰  为什么
Make sure you duck! Why?

1096
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,680
我不知道  电影里都是这样
I don't know. They always duck in the movies!

1097
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,890
快上去
Hop on up.

1098
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:22,570
好了  坐好了
All right. Here we go.

1099
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,900
你会晕机吗
Do you get airsick?

1100
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,510
我不知道  我没坐过飞机
Don't know. I've never been in the air before.

1101
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,490
我以前在秋千上吐过一次
I threw up on the swings once.

1102
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:34,160
安妮  我们现在去检查手机信号塔  要确保没有问题
Annie, we're gonna do a cell tower check. Make sure they're all working.

1103
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,870
这都是你自己做吗
You do that yourself?

1104
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,620
是啊  我跟你说过这很有趣的
Yep, told you work was fun.

1105
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,420
吉尔伯特  起飞吧
Gilbert, let's roll.

1106
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,590
不会有事的
You'll be all right.

1107
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,680
你知道"不漏接电话"  的秘密吗
You wanna know the secret to "Never drop a call"?

1108
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,100
不知道
Not really.

1109
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,430
我想  我想知道  特别想
Yes, yes, I do. Desperately.

1110
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,850
很好
Good.

1111
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:02,060
你看  我们的信号塔比其他手机要多5倍
See, we have five times as many cell towers as the other guys.

1112
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,860
但是我们把它们藏在显眼的地方  就像那个  你看
But we hide them in plain sight. Like right there. You see?

1113
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,780
没看到
No.

1114
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,360
在她的王冠上
It's in her crown.

1115
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,370
真是啊
Yeah!

1116
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,000
太棒了
That's so cool.

1117
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,500
很漂亮吧
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,960
你是怎么做到的  你是怎么成为世界之王的
How'd you do this? How'd you become king of the world?

1119
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:27,300
我才不是什么世界之王
Well, I wouldn't say king of the world.

1120
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,550
但我工作很努力
But I work my butt off.

1121
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,380
我越努力工作  机会就越多
The harder I work, the more opportunities I get.

1122
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,760
你看  你得打好手里的牌
See, you gotta play the cards that you've been dealt,

1123
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,640
不管手里的牌有多烂
no matter how bad the cards are.

1124
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,930
要是手里没牌怎么办
What if you don't have any cards?

1125
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,520
那你就虚张声势
Then you bluff.

1126
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,060
这就是  我为什么喜欢这个城市
See, that's what I love about this city.

1127
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:43,480
不管你是谁  干什么的
No matter who you are or what you are,

1128
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,820
只要对你想要的  为之付出  你就会有所回报
you just gotta want it bad enough, and work with what you got.

1129
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,700
This is just the start of your story

1130
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,540
If you got guts, you'll get glory

1131
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:02,500
Anyone can make their dreams come true

1132
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,210
In New York City

1133
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,090
And now's the time you gotta stand tough

1134
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:09,840
'Cause if you work hard, you can rise up

1135
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,970
Anyone can make it, even you

1136
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,680
In New York City

1137
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,430
Look at me, I'm just blood pumpin'

1138
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,180
You and me are two hearts thumpin'

1139
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:25,610
We are two souls feeling the same beat

1140
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:31,320
So take it all, the city's yours

1141
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,030
It's worth fighting for

1142
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,370
It's all yours

1143
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,370
So take it all

1144
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:42,870
The city's yours

1145
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,330
It's worth fighting for

1146
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,710
It's all mine

1147
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,970
It's all yours

1148
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,390
要不去96号街上空看看吧
Why don't you go above 96th Street?

1149
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:56,850
没问题
No reason.

1150
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,680
吉尔伯特  去市郊
Gilbert, go uptown.

1151
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,480
这就是我的纽约城
This is my New York City.

1152
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:09,440
你住在哪里
Where'd you live?

1153
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,360
四海为家
Everywhere.

1154
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,160
我看到一个手机信号塔了  哪里
I see a cell tower! Where?

1155
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,910
看到了吗  就在那
See it? Right there.

1156
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:19,160
在恶鸟下面
Right under that devil bird.

1157
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,580
好眼力
Good eyes.

1158
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,290
你知道吗  安妮  有时候你要找的东西
You know, Annie, sometimes what you're looking for

1159
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,840
就在你眼前
is right in front of your face.

1160
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,460
In New York City

1161
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:34,840
So take it all So take it all

1162
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:37,720
The city's yours The city's mine

1163
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,930
Worth fighting for It's worth fighting for

1164
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,430
It's all mine It's all mine

1165
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,270
So take it all So take it all

1166
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:49,230
The city's yours The city's mine

1167
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,190
Worth fighting for It's worth fighting for

1168
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,400
It's all mine It's all mine

1169
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,490
It's all yours

1170
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,450
In New York City

1171
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:03,580
格蕾丝
Grace.

1172
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,000
96号街的实时交通状况怎样
What's our presence past 96th Street?

1173
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,120
我们大多数都注意下面
Well, we're mostly focused below,

1174
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:09,460
我试试看  可能要找一会儿
but I've been saying for a while we should try...

1175
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,290
不用了  我找过的
No, but I had it this way.

1176
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,550
我来  我找到了
Let me do this. I've got it.

1177
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,130
我知道我在干什么
I know what I'm doing.

1178
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,760
法雷尔小姐
Miss Farrell?

1179
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,760
它到了  谢谢  是什么
It arrived. Thanks. What's that?

1180
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,300
我买了一条裙子给安妮  今晚去参加活动
I bought a dress for Annie to wear to the event tonight.

1181
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:22,070
很漂亮的
It's gorgeous.

1182
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,140
你只要帮她绑蝴蝶结  确保绸子...
I just need you to tie the bow and make sure that the satin...

1183
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,310
我绑蝴蝶结  对啊
I tie the bow? Yeah.

1184
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,890
我帮她穿裙子  你只要帮她绑蝴蝶结
I'm dressing her? You just have to tie the bow.

1185
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,310
什么样的蝴蝶结
No, I... What kind of bow?

1186
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,650
就是个简单的蝴蝶结  就像活结一样吗
It's just a simple bow. Like a slipknot?

1187
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:33,320
你要知道  我没参加过童子军  很简单的  威廉
'Cause you know I didn't take Boy Scouts. It's very easy, Will.

1188
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,490
还有绸子  要弄出来  绸子
And have the satin facing out. The satin?

1189
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:36,780
对  我知道有个女孩叫绸子
Yeah. I knew a girl named Satin.

1190
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,740
我相信你  你不用跟我详细描述了
I'm sure you did. You don't need to elaborate.

1191
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:41,990
绸子和蝴蝶结绝对不是我的强项  你知道吗  我会去的
Satin and bows is not necessarily my... You know what? I'll come over.

1192
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,080
那好吧  太好了
Yeah, I mean, either way. Great.

1193
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,950
她一定会很漂亮的
She's gonna look gorgeous.

1194
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,170
安妮
Annie.

1195

你没有
You did not...

1196
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,710
你没看到什么吗  我什么也没看到
You didn't see anything? I didn't see anything.

1197
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,220
很好  很好  因为我  我不知道  我以为我看到你
Good. Good. 'Cause I... Well, I don't know. I thought I saw you...

1198
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,510
没有  我一直都在这里
Nope! Here the whole time.

1199

What were you guys doing? Just hanging out?

1200
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:48,560
嗨  晚上好
Hi. Evening.

1201
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,810

No. Yes.

1205
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,700
这很旧了  这是我奶奶的  没什么
This is old. This is my grandmother's. It's nothing.

1206
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,030
你奶奶很漂亮
Your grandmother is hot.

1207
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,700
我是说我没  我从没见过你奶奶  我没有
I mean, not that I've... I've never seen your grandmother. I'm not...

1208
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,080
我是说这条裙子很漂亮
I'm saying that the dress is nice.

1209
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,990
你真会说话
Well, you're sweet.

1210

Let's go and get you dressed. Let's go!

1213
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:17,670
她还没换  我已经换了
Her dressed. I was already dressed.

1214
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,050
快点  对
Come on! Yes.

1215
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:21,340
快点  对
Come on. Yeah. Get some...

1216
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,850
准备好了吗  我很期待
Ready? Yes. I'm very excited.

1217
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,950
安妮  真漂亮  你太漂亮了
Annie, it's gorgeous. You're just gorgeous.

1218
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:43,990
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1219
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:47,780
好了  女士们  快走吧  我们就要迟到了
All right, ladies, let's go. Let's go. We're running late.

1220
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,870
安妮  哇
Annie! Wow.

1221
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,580
漂亮吧  我从没见过这么大的蝴蝶结
I know, right? I've never seen a bow this big.

1222
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,130
是啊  我发现  你把绸子放在蝴蝶结外面
Yes, and I noticed that you put the satin on the outside of the bow.

1223
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:56,250
这个想法真有趣
That's a very interesting choice.

1224
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,920
你知道吗  你快出去  我们还没弄完
You know what? Get out of here. We're not done yet.

1225
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,800
这里什么时候变成你们的了
You know what? When did this stop being my house?

1226
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,300
出去  好吧
Out! Okay, fine.

1227
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,220
你知道吗  一切都变了
You know what? You're changing everything.

1228
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,640
实际上  这以前还是巴斯奎特
As a matter of fact, this used to be a Basquiat.

1229
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,800
现在都是狗和鹿在草地上
Now it's a dog and a deer in a meadow.

1230
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,890
这样的组合有什么可爱的
Why is that combination so cute?

1231
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,440
过来  我们来梳头发
Come on. Let's do your hair.

1232
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,400
你和斯塔克斯为什么不在一起呢
Why aren't you and Mr. Stacks together?

1233
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,320
这是个复杂的问题
That's a complicated question.

1234
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:22,150
一点也不复杂  你喜欢他吗
Not really. Do you like him?

1235
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,620
我是他的下属  你知道的
Well, you know, I work for him. You know,

1236
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,320
喜欢他也不能代表什么
liking him doesn't really come into play.

1237
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:27,490
好吧
Okay.

1238
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,830
他是我的朋友吗  是的  我觉得他有魅力吗  当然有
I mean, is he my friend? Yes. Do I find him attractive? Sure.

1239
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:34,660
而且不只是感觉  他真的很帅
And not just in the physical sense. But he is very good-looking.

1240
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:37,830
他的肩膀很好看  面部轮廓也很好
He's got lovely shoulders and a great, chiseled face.

1241
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,130
嘴唇可爱  发型好看
Lovely lips. Good hair.

1242
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,840
我不赞成他的发型  姐姐
I wouldn't bank on the hair, sister.

1243
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,510
我还是太忙了  没空整这些事  所以．．．
Well, I'm far too busy to be bothered with anything like that anyway, so...

1244
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,010
这话就像斯塔克斯说的一样
That sounds like something Mr. Stacks would say.

1245
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:52,140
是吗
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1246
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,230
我朋友佩珀  当她喜欢一个男生
When my friend Pepper liked this boy at school,

1247
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,190
她就会用拳头打他
she punched him in the face.

1248
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,020
后来她退学了  不过他们现在一起去公园玩
She got suspended, but they play in the park together now.

1249
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,860
有时候我也想打斯塔克斯的脸
Sometimes I'd like to punch Mr. Stacks in the face.

1250
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,880
我是说真正的打
I'm just meaning punching.

1251
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,700
我真的想打他  他很讨人厌
That's it. I just want to punch him. He's annoying.

1252
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,330
谢谢你做的这一切  威廉  你的名字在上面看起来很好
Thanks for doing this, Will. Your name's gonna look great up there.

1253
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,340
你确定古根海姆  同意删除他们的名字
Now, you sure the Guggenheims are okay with me taking their name off?

1254
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,250
你给了我无数个理由  可以不用管他们
You gave me 100 million reasons not to care.

1255
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,510
他们找到我父母了吗
Did they find anything on my parents?

1256
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:28,550
还没有  我们会尽力的  抱歉
No, not yet. And we dug real deep. I'm sorry.

1257
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,390
谢谢
Thanks for trying.

1258
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:31,890
安妮
Annie!

1259
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,140
安妮  快过来  安妮
Annie, come on! Annie, Annie!

1260
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:38,520
纽约人每天都会面临挑战
New Yorkers face challenges every single day.

1261
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,980
看是不可逾越的挑战
Challenges that seem insurmountable.

1262
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,110
我们都会对自己说"不"
We all tell ourselves "no" a lot.

1263
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:45,320
我们说"我得不到那份工作的"
We say, "No, I won't get that job,"

1264
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,360
或者"不  我付不起大学学费"
or, "No, I can't afford college."

1265
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,020
除非你是富兰克林
Unless it's you, Franklin,

1266
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,910
来自马沙文雅岛的穷街陋巷
coming from the mean streets of Martha's Vineyard.

1267
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,410
嗨
Hey! Yeah.

1268
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:58,210
我们把"不"  改成"好"
Let's change those noes to yeses.

1269
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:03,000
因为你说不的时候  其实我们只是害怕说好
Because when we say no, we're actuallyjust scared to say yes.

1270
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:06,210
所以我们要开始对自己说好
So, let's start saying yes to ourselves,

1271
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,970
对美好的未来说好
and let's say yes to a brighter future.

1272
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:14,560
你们大多数人都知道  最近有个小客人跟我一起住
Now, many of you know that I've had a visitor staying with me recently.

1273
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,600
她只知道"好"  安妮
She only knows the word "yes." Annie?

1274
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,890
你能上来一下吗
Could you come up, please?

1275
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,400
去吧  你很棒的  快去吧  亲爱的
Go on. You'll be great. Go on, darling.

1276
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,570
快咽下嘴里的虾  安妮
Swallow your shrimp, Annie.

1277
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,070
安妮  我不想让你尴尬
Now, Annie, I don't wanna embarrass you.

1278
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,410
我只想让各位看看  这个城市的未来是怎样的
I just want everyone to see what the future of our city is all about.

1279
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:34,950
你有什么话想对这些
Now, do you have anything you want to say

1280
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,580
心藏愧疚的好人说吗
to these good people that are just oozing with liberal guilt?

1281
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,290
除了你  参议员
Except for you, Senator.

1282
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:43,040
我知道你在反对
I know you're trying to build that fence.

1283
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:48,760
我真不敢相信  我会来这里
I can't believe I'm here.

1284
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,630
我穿着像云一样的裙子
I'm in a dress that feels like a cloud.

1285
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,470
我站在一个巨型肉桂卷的中央
I'm standing in the middle of a giant cinnamon roll.

1286
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,060
身边组合  他们拿着小提琴
With a band that has little violins,

1287
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,730
大提琴
big violins,

1288
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,360
还有那个
one of those.

1289
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,070
钢琴
A piano.

1290
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,320
斯塔克斯教会了我很多
Mr. Stacks has taught me so much.

1291
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,070
他给了我一个很棒的机会
He's given me such a big opportunity.

1292
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:19,200
Under the glow of the very bright lights

1293
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:28,050
I turn my face towards the warm night skies

1294
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:35,760
And I am not afraid of a thousand eyes

1295
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:43,480
When they're above five hundred smiles

1296
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,690
Oh, I used to think

1297
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,690
Oh, she used to think

1298
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,690
What wouldn't I give

1299
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,450
What wouldn't she give

1300
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:57,370
For a moment like this

1301
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:01,750
This moment, this gift

1302
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:04,540
Now look at me

1303
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,170
And this opportunity

1304
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,880
Is standing right in front of me

1305
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:15,390
But one thing I know It's only part luck and so

1306
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:18,510
I'm putting on my best show

1307
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:23,350
Under the spotlight I'm starting my life

1308
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,350
Big dreams becoming real tonight

1309
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:31,400
So look at me and this opportunity

1310
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,320
You're witnessing my moment, you see?

1311
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,330
My big opportunity

1312
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,750
Oh, I used to think

1313
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:45,580
Oh, she used to think

1314
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,580
What I wouldn't give

1315
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,250
What wouldn't she give

1316
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:53,510
For a moment like this

1317
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:58,550
This moment, this gift

1318
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,260
And now look at me

1319
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:03,350
And this opportunity

1320
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,560
Is standing right in front of me

1321
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:11,270
But one thing I know It's only part luck and so

1322
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,860
I'm putting on my best show

1323
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:19,320
Under the spotlight I'm starting my life

1324
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:23,160
Big dreams becoming real tonight

1325
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,460
So look at me and this opportunity

1326
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:30,540
You're witnessing my moment, you see?

1327
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:35,050
我的伟大机会
My big opportunity

1328
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,130
我不会浪费的
I won't waste it

1329
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:41,600
我保证
I guarantee.

1330
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,440
鞠躬
Take a bow.

1331
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:52,060
太棒了
That was great.

1332
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,820
现在读我写的演讲稿  什么
Now read my speech. What?

1333
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,240
我给你写的演讲稿  就在那儿
That speech I wrote you. My speech. It's right there.

1334
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,860
有什么问题吗
Is everything all right?

1335
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,870
我帮她放大一点
I'll make it bigger for her.

1336
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,120
这里开始"谢谢  斯塔克斯先生"
There it is. "Thank you, Mr. Stacks."

1337
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,540
等一下  不要
Hold on a second. No.

1338
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,000
安妮  有什么问题吗
Annie, is everything okay?

1339
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,580
让我一个人  静一静
Leave me alone.

1340
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:13,920
安妮  安妮
Annie! Annie!

1341
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:17,090
安妮
Annie?

1342
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:24,010
这是你们的大机会
This is your big opportunity

1343
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,390
给威廉·斯塔克斯投票
To vote for William Stacks

1344
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:29,310
安妮
Annie.

1345
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,860
等等  等一下
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

1346
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,280
安妮
Annie!

1347
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,740
嘿  等一下  安妮  慢点  你干什么
Hey! Wait, Annie. Slow down. What are you doin'?

1348
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,070
安妮  等一下  我来
Annie. Wait, wait, wait. I got it.

1349
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,780
怎么回事  没什么
What's going on? It's nothing.

1350
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:46,950
小姑娘  你要告诉我  你现在是怎么回事
Young lady, you're have to tell me what's going on with you now!

1351
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,250
不  我不要  你又不是我爸爸
No, I don't! You're not my dad.

1352
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,630
哇
Wow.

1353
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:58,710
我知道  我知道  我不是你爸爸
Well, I know that. I know I'm not your dad.

1354
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,880
但是我想知道  你到底怎么了
But I would like to know what's going on with you.

1355
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:06,850
我不会读
I can't read.

1356
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:12,270
不会读是什么意思  我看你读过书啊  安妮
What do you mean you can't read? I've watched you read, Annie.

1357
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:14,060
你可能只是太紧张了
Maybe you were just nervous.

1358
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:16,270
抱歉  我搞砸了你的晚会
Sorry I ruined your shrimp event.

1359
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,490
怎么回事  我不知道  她吓到了
What happened? I don't know. She freaked out.

1360
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,610
嘿  你们俩之前在聊什么
Hey, what were you two talking about earlier?

1361
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:26,910
她要我帮她找她父母  不过毫无希望
She asked me to help her find her parents, but it was a dead end.

1362
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:29,330
即使找我警局的朋友  也帮不上忙
Even asked some of my old buddies on the force.

1363
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,660
什么也找不到
There's nothing on that kid.

1364
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,040
她的父母
Her parents.

1365
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,580
太好了
Genius.

1366
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:37,380
安妮  怎么了  往后退  让开
Annie, what's wrong? Get back! Hey, hey, get back!

1367
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,840
格蕾丝  让开
Grace! Get back!

1368
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,760
纳什  嘿
Nash! Hey!

1369
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,930
让一让  她只是个孩子  让开  她只是个孩子
Make room! She's a kid. Get back. She's a kid.

1370
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,890
拜托  让开  她只是个孩子
Come on. Get back. She's a kid!

1371
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,650
谁啊
Who is it?

1372
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,530
我是盖伊  我是威廉·斯塔克斯的下属
It's Guy Danlily. I work for Will Stacks.

1373
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,040
进来
Come in.

1374
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,600
你好
Hello there.

1375
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,100
科琳·汉尼根
Colleen Hannigan?

1376
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:34,480
那是我的婚前姓
That's my maiden name.

1377
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,020
不过我还没有结婚  你明白我的意思吧
But I'm not married to it, if you know what I mean.

1378
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:41,900
我可以再请你喝一杯吗
Can I buy you another drink?

1379
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,740
要是他被选上了  我就会得到一笔钱
So, if he wins, I get paid a fortune.

1380
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,160
比我之前得到的都要多
More than anything I've ever been paid combined.

1381
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,200
为什么那么多
Why so much?

1382
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,620
就像赌了一匹黑马一样
It's like getting paid long odds on a dark horse.

1383
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,710
你知道  帮威廉·斯塔克斯赢得选举有多难吗
Do you know how hard it is to get Will Stacks elected?

1384
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:56,870
"绝不漏接一个电话"  这有什么意义
"Never drop a call." What does that even mean?

1385
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,000
现在大家都发短信了
Everybody texts now.

1386
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,340
还有比他更糟的官员呢
There have been worse politicians than him.

1387
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,380
我知道  是我帮他们选上的
I know. I got them elected.

1388
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:05,090
施瓦辛格  金正日  那个卖钻石的家伙
Schwarzenegger, Kim Jong-Il, that blood diamonds guy.

1389
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,090
什么  那都是过去的事了
What? But I'm over it.

1390
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,930
我已经厌倦了  做一只人人需要的蟑螂  还要把我当作
I'm tired of being the cockroach everybody needs, but treats like a...

1391
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:12,390
蟑螂  没错
Cockroach? Exactly.

1392
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,020
干了这次我就不干了  拿了钱就退出
This is my last roll at the table. Get paid and get out.

1393
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,940
根本就没有什么能够全身而退的  相信我
There's no such thing as a way out. Trust me.

1394
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,020
一定会有办法全身而退的  相信我
There's always a way out. Trust me.

1395
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,900
这次很特殊  只要找到安妮的父母
And in this particular case, it's all about finding Annie's parents.

1396
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:30,620
我不想再做一只黑猫了
You know, I'm tired of being the black hat

1397
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,240
整天围着疯人院团团转
Of running the show down in the snake pit

1398
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:34,750
你在对我唱歌
Are you singing to me?

1399
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,210
这是我们逃离这里的机会
So this is our chance to get out of this place

1400
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,460
这不是幻觉吧
Is this really happening?

1401
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:44,260
快起来  我们一起奔向
So come on, let's run for it to

1402
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,090
康庄大道
Easy street

1403
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:57,020
睡到自然醒
Where you sleep till noon

1404
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,890
耶  耶  耶
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1405
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,170
如果斯塔克斯帮安妮找到父母
If Stacks reunites Annie with her parents,

1406
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,820
绝对有80%的人会投他
80% surge in the polls for sure.

1407
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,360
我们已经聊过这个了  他们根本不存在
We talked about this already. They don't exist.

1408
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,700
我们可以让他们存在
We'll make them exist.

1409
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:11,530
找一对夫妇  假装成她的父母
Find a couple people to pretend to be her parents.

1410
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,830
他们了解各种细节
They learn every detail

1411
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:15,620
然后奇迹般的出现在选举之前  就可以了
and miraculously show up right before the election.

1412
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,120
就这样  很快就有父母了
Add water, instant parents.

1413
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,830
那我有什么好处
What's in it for me?

1414
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,830
跟我得到的一样
Same as for me. Ka-ching.

1415
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,840
不用再做蟑螂了
And no more being a cockroach.

1416
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,420
我将成为一个不愁珠宝的大富婆
Yeah, I'll be the girl who's dripping in jewelry

1417
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,760
我唱歌时  大家为我而疯狂
The crowds'll go wild when I sing

1418
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:36,430
我不用再面临那个防火梯
I won't have to look out on a fire escape

1419
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:37,810
是两个
Two.

1420
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:40,770
马上就上排行榜
The view will be billboards of me

1421
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:45,150
康庄大道  康庄大道
On easy street On easy street

1422
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,320
康庄大道  康庄大道
Easy street Easy street

1423
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,490
敬我们的出路
To a way out.

1424
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:54,700
变成有钱人  变成有钱人
Where we all get paid Where we all get paid

1425
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,200
耶  耶  耶  耶  耶
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah

1426
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,290
行动起来  行动起来
Move them feet to Move them feet to

1427
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,550
康庄大道  康庄大道
Easy street Easy street

1428
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:14,630
等你到那儿了  等你到那儿了
When you get there When you get there

1429
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,100
就别走了  就别走了
Stay Stay

1430
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,270
我就知道我喜欢上你了
I knew I liked you.

1431
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,530
好吧  那我们现在别这样  没事  没关系
Okay, we're not doing that right now. That's fine. Yolo, yolo. That's fine.

1432
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:29,190
敬康庄大道
To easy street.

1433
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,040
我告诉过她  她在这个城市  想干什么都可以
I've been telling her she can do anything she wants to do in this city,

1434
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:47,250
但是我现在才发现  她竟然不会读书
and come to find out she can't even read.

1435
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,210
怎么会这样
How does that happen?

1436
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:53,470
不光是孩子迷失  威廉  很多大人也会迷失
A lot of kids get lost, Will. A lot of people get lost.

1437
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,760
这不能接受
Well, it's unacceptable.

1438
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,760
我们要给她找个家教
We gotta get her a tutor.

1439
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:00,060
不过是为了她吧  这回不是为了媒体了
For her, though, right? Not just for the press.

1440
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,430
是为了她
For her.

1441
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:04,900
笑什么
What?

1442
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,900
我能感觉到  你美丽动人的嘴唇  在微笑
I can feel you smiling with those Britisher-than-thou lips.

1443
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:10,070
我会替你保守秘密的  蝙蝠侠
Your secret's safe with me, Batman.

1444
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:12,360
什么秘密  你关心她
What secret? That you care about her.

1445
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,030
我关心所有纽约的孩子
I care about the kids that are in New York City.

1446
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,450
还有安妮
And Annie.

1447
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:19,870
当然  她住在纽约
Well, she lives in New York.

1448
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,580
所以她也受到关心
So, therefore, she's cared for.

1449
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:26,580
是全部人  她也包括在内
It's a blanket... She's within the structure of the whatever.

1450
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:39,430
安妮  你要去哪里
Annie? Where you going?

1451
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:44,140
谢谢你做的一切  抱歉我昨晚搞砸了
Thanks for everything. Sorry I messed up last night.

1452
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,520
希望你还能做市长
Hope you can still be mayor.

1453
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,480
你在说什么  快回来
What are you talking about? Get back here.

1454
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:52,360
没关系  这方面我很有经验
It's okay. I'm good at this part.

1455
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,320
我经常被别人  赶出去
I've had a lot of practice getting kicked out of places.

1456
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,030
安妮
Annie.

1457
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:02,580
快把包放下  你哪儿也不许去
Listen, put your bag down. You're not going anywhere.

1458
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:05,000
桑迪也要走  别说了
Sandy's gotta go. Stop it.

1459
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,210
你和桑迪都待在这里  我不管昨天发生了什么
You and Sandy are staying here, and I don't care what happened last night.

1460
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,880
不是  桑迪真的要走了
No, I mean Sandy's gotta go.

1461
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,670
不  我是说...桑迪要走好
No, I mean... Sandy's gotta go. Okay.

1462
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,880
是要香槟还是冰淇淋  什么
Well, is it champagne or gelato? What?

1463
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:19,180
要山露汽水还是普通的饮料
Is it Mountain Dew or is it just plain old doo?

1464
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,310
要柠檬水还是鸡块
Is it lemonade or chicken nuggets?

1465
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:25,100
我也该走了  我也想去  因为我的膀胱都快爆了
I should go. Now I wanna go because my bladder's full.

1466
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,350
快点  走吧
Come on, let's go.

1467
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:28,520
我看到你签字了
I saw you sign your name.

1468
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,610
你只想知道是怎么做到的吗
That's all you gotta know how to do.

1469
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:33,230
但是你的老师呢  这是怎么做到的
But what about your teachers? How is this possible?

1470
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,240
我善于隐藏
I'm good at hiding it.

1471
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,360
在家呢  他们在家都没有发现吗
Okay, at home. They didn't catch it at home?

1472
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:39,280
"在家"
"At home"?

1473
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,370
你怎么没有告诉任何人
How come you didn't tell anybody about this?

1474
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:44,200
首先  不是整个世界都会关心一个领养的孩子
It's not like the whole world wants a foster kid to begin with.

1475
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,790
其次  这很丢人  我不想别人知道
And plus, it's embarrassing. I didn't want anyone to know.

1476
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:53,090
你知道吗
You know what?

1477
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:56,010
我想给你看样东西
I wanna show you something.

1478
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,430
这里很不错
This is good here.

1479
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,730
这是哪里  皇后区
Where are we? Queens.

1480
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:08,730
我需要护照吗
Do I need my passport?

1481
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:13,570
安妮  事实上  每个人都有
Truth is, Annie, everybody's got something

1482
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,780
不想被别人知道的秘密
that they don't want anybody to know.

1483
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:16,610
我也是
Including me.

1484
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,860
对于我  这就是
For me, this is it.

1485
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,320
这是我的家庭
This is my family.

1486
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:24,910
你现在能看到他们吗
Can you see them right now?

1487
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:27,910
看不到  但他们在我的脑海里
No, I don't. I see them in my mind.

1488
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,920
就像这一段铁轨
Like this part of the track right here?

1489
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,840
这是我父亲建造的  每天工作20个小时
This is where my father worked 20 hours a day.

1490
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,670
除了工作  还是工作
Work, and work, and work, and work.

1491
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,760
然后他死了
And then he died.

1492
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:40,260
那时我12岁
I was 12 years old.

1493
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,930
他长什么样子
What was he like?

1494
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:45,850
我不知道  我几乎不了解他  他总是在工作
I don't know. I barely knew him. He was always working.

1495
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:49,940
这就是我为什么觉得  如果我工作的够努力的话
And that's why I felt like if I worked hard enough,

1496
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:52,560
那我就有可能  离他更近了
then that'd probably bring me closer to him.

1497
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:57,690
所以我有了这个
And that's why I developed this.

1498
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:59,360
好吧
Well,

1499
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:03,780
现在  你有了这个
now, you got this.

1500
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:12,090
是啊  安妮
Yeah, all right, Annie.

1501
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,630
我眼睛里好像有花粉什么的  好痛
You know, this pollen or something's got my eyes all scratchy.

1502
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:18,050
我们走这边吧  我们还可以看到火车要去哪里
Let's walk this way. We can see where the trains go.

1503
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:25,970
这么多年没见了  见到你真好
It's so good to see you after all these years!

1504
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:31,100
西装男  少废话  你要先登记
Yo, suit. No cuts, no butts, no coconuts. You gotta sign in.

1505
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:32,900
为什么  试演
For what? The auditions.

1506
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:34,100
试演
Audition?

1507
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:36,730
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

1508
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:37,860
等下
Wait!

1509
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:41,700
"我们一直都在找你"
"We've been trying so hard to find you!"

1510
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:44,110
她在哪里  在后面  怎么了
Where is she? Back there. Why?

1511
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,280
等下
Wait!

1512
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:47,370
嘿  站住  站住
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1513
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:48,580
等下
Wait!

1514
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,080
这个想法很有趣
That's an interesting choice.

1515
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,960
"噢  亲爱的孩子  这么多年没见  见到你真好
"Oh, darling girl! It's so good to see you after all these years!"

1516
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,090
"我们一直在找你"
"We've been trying so hard to find you,

1517
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:01,380
"后来我们看到  你和竞选市长的男神在一起的照片"
"and then we saw pictures of you with the nice man running for mayor."

1518
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,800
"我们来唱一首特别的  只有我们3个人知道的歌"
"Let's sing our special song only us three know."

1519
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:06,100
盒式吊坠
Locket!

1520
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,020
The sun will come out

1521
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,440
Pronto!

1522
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:17,020
Bet your sweet bottom, fella, that Bet your sweet bottom, fella, that

1523
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:19,270
Pronto!

1524
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,070
There'II be sun!

1525
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,120
这是怎么回事
What the hell is this?

1526
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,320
太糟糕了
A disaster.

1527
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:29,620
你是垃圾  你是一坨屎
You're garbage. You're pitchy.

1528
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:30,790
下一组  拜托
Next! Come on.

1529
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:32,750
我很喜欢这个台词  大卫·克雷默来过了
I really like the script. David Kramer says hello!

1530
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:34,370
快出去  白痴
Out! That hack.

1531
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,380
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1532
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:38,960
是你说要找两个人来演她的父母
You told me to find two people to play her parents.

1533
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:41,130
我是说找朋友或邻居
I meant some friends or some neighborhood toughs.

1534
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:42,670
不是公开试演
Not open auditions.

1535
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,130
这些人都很糟糕  我知道
These are callbacks. I know, right?

1536
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,510
他们为什么还要唱歌  大家喜欢音乐
And why are they singing? People love musicals.

1537
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,810
用音乐开头不需要理由  这样十分有魔力
Bursting into song for no apparent reason. It's magical!

1538
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:52,390
这儿有窗  这儿有床
There's a window There's a bed

1539
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,810
这儿有桌子  这儿有你的头
Here's a table There's your head

1540
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:55,020
好了  够了
Okay. You're done.

1541
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:58,560
我去找父母  你什么也不用做
I'll take care of finding the parents. You don't do anything.

1542
01:25:58,650 --> 01:25:59,820
等我需要你了  再打给你
I'll call you when I need you.

1543
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:02,400
但是  没有但是  我们没有时间了
But... No buts. We're running out of time.

1544
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,830
摸一下指示牌  我摸到了
Touch the sign! I did it!

1545
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,300
你有没有见过鬼马小精灵呕吐
You ever see Casper the Friendly Ghost throw up?

1546
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,420
没有
No.

1547
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,180
你喜欢棉花糖吗
Would you like a marshmallow?

1548
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,100
全麦饼干怎么样  你这个混
Psych! How about a graham cracker? You son of a...

1549
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,110
你笑死我了
You make me laugh.

1550
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,990
嘿  格蕾丝  我问你一件事
Hey, Grace. Let me ask you something.

1551
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:00,830
想成为一个监护人  到底有多难
Exactly how hard would it be to become a foster parent?

1552
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:03,630
而且不是暂时的  就像
And not temporarily either. More like a...

1553
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:07,380
你知道的  那种永久性的
Well, you know, permanent situation.

1554
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,550
你是说  要领养安妮
You mean, adopt Annie?

1555
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,970
是的  不管用什么词
Yeah, well, whatever the word is.

1556
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,310
就是这个词  威廉
That's the word, Will.

1557
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,730
那
Then...

1558
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,730
好
Yeah.

1559
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,670
桑迪
Sandy.

1560
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:46,300
我们在床上睡觉了
We slept in the bed.

1561
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,420
你更喜欢哪一个  威廉
Which one do you prefer, Will?

1562
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,720
红色
Red.

1563
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,520
已经两个小时了  我觉得她完全学会识字了
It's been two hours. I don't think she's completely learned to read yet.

1564
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,980
嗯  不是完全  不过
Yeah, well, not completely, but...

1565
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,730
威廉  威廉
Will! Will!

1566
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,270
我们找到变革者了
We got our game changer.

1567
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,820
每个竞选都有一个变革者  我们找到我们的变革者了
Every election needs a game changer. We got our game changer.

1568
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,820
别再说"变革者"了  安妮的父母
Stop saying "game changer." Annie's parents.

1569
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:09,440
他们看到她的照片  他们打电话给我们了  这就是奇迹
They saw her picture, and they called us. It's a miracle.

1570
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:13,620
"变革者"  很明显  他们这些年一直在找她
"Game changer." Apparently, they've been looking for her for years,

1571
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,830
但她不在失踪儿童的系统里
but she's not in the system.

1572
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:16,620
他们怎么知道  她就是他们的女儿
How do they know she's their daughter?

1573
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,790
他们了解她的一切  他们知道盒式吊坠  纸条
Well, they know everything about her. They know about the locket, the note,

1574
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,290
我还帮他们做了DNA测试
and oh, yeah, I ran a DNA test.

1575
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:24,880
这下好了
Boom goes the dynamite.

1576
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,260
DNA  测试
DNA test.

1577
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,680
好的  先别告诉安妮
All right, but don't tell her.

1578
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,430
我想在安妮知道之前  先见见他们
I wanna meet them before Annie finds out.

1579
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,930
好的  没问题  不过应该由你
I wouldn't have it any other way. I mean, you should totally be the one

1580
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:42,020
来告诉安妮  是我们找到她的父母
who tells Annie that we found her parents!

1581
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:43,690
你找到我父母了
You found my parents?

1582
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,320
是的  亲爱的  我们找到了  真的吗
Yes, honey, we did. Well, we think so. Really?

1583
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,190
是的  我们要去一个叫多玛尼的餐馆  见他们
Yeah. We're gonna meet them at a place called the Domani.

1584
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,620
那就是留下纸条的地方  不会吧
That's where the note is from! No way!

1585
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:53,660
我就知道他们会来找我的
I knew they'd come for me.

1586
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,910
安妮  我真替你高兴  我知道这是你一直想要的
I'm happy for you, Annie. I know this is what you always wanted.

1587
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,330
这都要谢谢你
And it's all because of you.

1588
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,220
我真不敢相信  我就要看到我父母了  我有点害怕
I can't believe I'm gonna see my parents. I'm kind of freaking out.

1589
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,440
安妮  安妮  快过来
Annie! Annie! Over here!

1590
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,060
你开心吗  你开心吗
Are you happy? Are you happy?

1591
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:28,860
我们真替你高兴  谢谢
Very happy for you. Thanks.

1592
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,110
安妮与父母重聚
Annie, The Reunion.

1593
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:35,570
安妮  我的女儿
Annie. My girl.

1594
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,950
能匹配吗  我看看
Is it a match? Let's see, huh?

1595
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:44,580
刚好吻合
It's a match.

1596
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,880
我们还以为要永远失去你了呢  我也是
We thought we'd lost you forever. Me, too.

1597
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,380
我们一直过得不好
We fell upon hard times.

1598
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,500
我们觉得  让别人来照顾你  那样会更好
We just felt it was best for someone else to look after you.

1599
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,550
我明白
I figured.

1600
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:54,300
我一直都无法原谅我自己
I've never forgiven myself for it.

1601
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:57,680
但是我们回去找你的时候  我们又找不到你了  孩子
But when we got back on our feet, well, we just couldn't find you, kid.

1602
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:00,140
不过天使一直在照顾你
But the angels were looking out.

1603
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,220
你们住在哪里  新泽西
Where do you live? New Jersey.

1604
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,310
不过我们搬到巴西了  因为我的工作调动
But we're moving to Brazil for my job.

1605
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,690
我觉得你会喜欢那里的  太好了
I think you're gonna like it there. Cool.

1606
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:10,230
好了  我们开始吧
Okay, let's get started.

1607
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,030
一切都很顺利
Everything is in order.

1608
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:15,900
我们还有法官签字的  DNA测试结果
We have the DNA test signed by the judge.

1609
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,570
现在  我们只需要家长签字了
Now, we just need signatures of the parents.

1610
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,490
叫你们呢  叫我们
That's you guys. That's us.

1611
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,660
女士  签在这里
Ma'am, sign right there.

1612
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:27,370
嘿  还记得我吗
Hey. Remember me from before?

1613
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:29,420
我记得  是的

01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:14,780
要幸福下去  你也是
Never slow your roll. You neither.

1746
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,200
狗狗真可爱
What a cute dog.

1747
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:24,490
走吧  再见
Come on. Bye.

1748
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,290
再见
Bye.

1749
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,590
再见  安妮
Goodbye, Annie.

1750
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:37,880
媒体就爱吃这套  我们以压倒性的优势赢了
The press is eating this up. We're gonna crush.

1751
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:42,600
再见  哈罗德·格雷  你这个可怜的公益空想家
Goodbye, Harold Gray, you pathetic, nonprofit do-gooder.

1752
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:49,440
格蕾丝  手机电池的事情怎么样了
Grace, where are we with that phone battery?

1753
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,480
什么
What?

1754
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,940
一周的续航  那件事进展怎么样了
A full week on one charge, where are we with that?

1755
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,940
我们就快完成了  那就是还没有完成
We're close. Close is not good enough.

1756
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:58,190
我们没有  我们已经浪费很多时间了
Well, we don't have the... We've already wasted enough time.

1757
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:01,070
我要召集研发部门
I'm gonna go call the research department.

1758
01:40:09,290 --> 01:40:10,580
要听话  孩子
Knock them dead, kid.

1759
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,920
再见  安妮
Bye, Annie!

1760
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,800
威廉  我不喜欢看到你这样
Will? I hate seeing you like this.

1761
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,560
格蕾丝  我没事  我们
Grace, I'm fine. Let's just...

1762
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:33,690
斯塔克斯先生  我觉得你得听听这个
Mr. Stacks, I think you're gonna wanna hear this.

1763
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:34,900
安妮有麻烦了
Annie's in trouble.

1764
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,770
什么  那不是她亲生父母
What? Those weren't her real parents.

1765
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:39,860
什么  怎么回事  别理她  她肯定是疯了
What? What is happening? Ignore her, 'cause she's clearly insane.

1766
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,450
说话注意点  混蛋
Watch your mouth, chango.

1767
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:44,320
我做了一件坏事  我真的很遗憾
Look, I did something terrible, and I'm really sorry.

1768
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:46,120
你说他们不是她亲生父母是什么意思
What do you mean those aren't her real parents?

1769
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:49,040
他让他们把她带到别的地方
He had them take her somewhere.

1770
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,410
我真不敢相信  我竟然跟你跳舞  你跟他跳舞了
I can't believe I danced with you! You danced with him?

1771
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,290
当时我很绝望  他又有点动手动脚的
I was desperate. He was a little handsy.

1772
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,500
安妮在哪儿  你干什么了
Where is Annie? What have you done?

1773
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:56,920
安妮在哪儿
Where's Annie?

1774
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:59,300
巴西冷不冷
Is it cold in Brazil?

1775
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,470
有点冷  她在问你问题
Just be cool. She's asking questions.

1776
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:07,970
你在收集烟灰缸吗  没有
Do you collect ashtrays? No.

1777
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,640
艺术品  没有
Art? No.

1778
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:13,100
你会弹钢琴吗  闭嘴
Do you play piano? Just shut up.

1779
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:14,230
我们要去哪里
Where are we going?

1780
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:17,940
我们要带你去个地方  就一段时间
We're just taking you someplace for a little bit. Just relax.

1781
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,610
你们不是我的亲生父母  是不是
You're not my real parents, are you?

1782
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:24,410
坐好  别动  你干什么  别这样
Sit back. Sit still. What are you doing? Stop that.

1783
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:26,990
放我走  等斯塔克斯发现了
Let me go! When Mr. Stacks finds out about this...

1784
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:30,080
斯塔克斯再也不需要你了  要不然我们为什么要带走你
Stacks doesn't need you anymore. Why do you think we're taking you?

1785
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:35,420
你是斯塔克斯的手下  他才不会这么做的
You work for Mr. Stacks? He wouldn't do this.

1786
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:39,000
我觉得他已经拍了足够多的照片了
Yeah, well, I guess he has enough photos.

1787
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:44,760
这是斯塔克斯干的
Mr. Stacks did this?

1788
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,940
召集FBI所有人手  我要所有人都出动
Call my guy at the FBI. I want to get everyone on it.

1789
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:54,980
我知道
I got it.

1790
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,400
我已经让警察负责了
I'm already on with the police.

1791
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:57,690
我以为不会发生这种事
I didn't think anything like this could happen.

1792
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:59,400
你怎么会不知道她是怎样的人
How could you not know who has her?

1793
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,610
我有手下负责这种事
I got a guy who takes care of these kinds of things.

1794
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:03,070
我们没必要插手  相信我
It keeps our hands clean. Trust me.

1795
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,030
我怎么可能相信你  你把安妮带走了
I can't trust you. You took Annie.

1796
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:23,050
嘿
Hey!

1797
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:24,590
嘿  听着
Hey, look!

1798
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,340
是我  安妮
It's me! Annie!

1799
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:28,680
嘿  有个女孩  救命
Hey, girl! Help!

1800
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:29,970
快抓住她  快抓住她
Get her. Grab her.

1801
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,310
坐好  快坐好  别碰我
Sit, sit, sit still. Don't touch me!

1802
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:33,470
别动
Sit still!

1803
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:39,650
所有人  都听好
Everybody, listen up.

1804
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:42,690
查一下方圆10公里内的每一个电话  好的
Check every call within a 10-mile radius. On it.

1805
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:44,070
我就知道他们可以查到
I knew they could do that!

1806
01:42:44,150 --> 01:42:46,070
有人把安妮的照片  发到微博上了
Someone just posted a picture ofAnnie on Twitter.

1807
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:48,070
在哪儿  54号和6号街
Where? 54th and 6th.

1808
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,490
还有一条关于安妮的博客  她好像在挥手
Another one on an Annie blog. It looks like she's waving.

1809
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,030
好像是57号到6号街  我们走
57th and 6th. Let's go.

1810
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:55,960
嘿  你要是去的话  所有人都会知道的
Hey. You do this, and everyone will know.

1811
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,710
别再想着当什么市长了  你会把一切都毁掉的
Forget about being mayor. It'll destroy your whole business!

1812
01:42:58,790 --> 01:42:59,920
我不在乎
I don't care.

1813
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,210
你这是犯一个天大的错误  想想你之前付出的一切
You're making a huge mistake. Think about everything you've worked for.

1814
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:04,630
这都不重要了
That everything means nothing.

1815
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,380
你走人吧
You're fired.

1816
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:08,010
你去跟他说说
You! Talk to him.

1817
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,430
他只听你的
You're the only one he'll listen to.

1818
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:14,810
你这样  她不会喜欢你的
It's not 'cause she likes you.

1819
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:17,640
她打人还真疼
She's got these pointy little...

1820
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:23,520
这飞机不错  这是什么  贝尔4297
Nice chopper! What is this, a Bell 4297

1821
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:24,690
你说什么
What?

1822
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,030
怎么了  我这种家伙不能了解直升机吗
What, a guy like me can't know about helicopters?

1823
01:43:27,110 --> 01:43:29,820
其实我对直升机一点也不懂  都写在这里
I don't know anything about helicopters! It's written right here.

1824
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:32,200
吉尔伯特  我们走吧  收到了
Gilbert, let's go. Roger that.

1825
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:33,580
"收"  是谁
Who's Roger? Who's Roger?

1826
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:40,120
有人晕机吗
Is anyone else dizzy?

1827
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:45,710
看  是安妮  救命
Look! It's Annie! Help.

1828
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,920
又发了一张照片  65号和10号街
Another picture on lnstagram. 65th and 10th.

1829
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:49,220
往西边去  吉尔伯特
Head west, Gil.

1830
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,520
嘿  你在干什么  嘿
Hey, what are you doing? Hey!

1831
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,600
让她别动
Hold her still.

1832
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:07,490
我们会找到她的  威廉
We'll find her, Will.

1833
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,420
又有一条是在华盛顿大桥发的
Just posted on the George Washington Bridge.

1834
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:13,410
她在挥手  她是故意挥手的
She's waving. She's doing it on purpose!

1835
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:14,580
去郊区  吉尔
Head uptown, Gil.

1836
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:25,960
在那里
There she is!

1837
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,260
别跟丢了
Don't lose them.

1838
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,640
又有一条博客  他正前往国家公园的方向
On an Annie blog! She's heading to the State Park.

1839
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,970
他们去往公园
They're headed into the park.

1840
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:39,230
吉尔伯特  你要小心点
Gilbert, don't make me come up there and fly this helicopter.

1841
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,400
他们在那儿
There they are!

1842
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,320
安妮  安妮
Annie! Annie! Annie!

1843
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,900
她听不见的
I don't think she can hear you.

1844
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:58,080
不是吧  警察
What? It's the cops.

1845
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:10,670
不是的  是斯塔克斯
Oh, no. It's Stacks.

1846
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:12,760
他为什么要跟着我们
Why would he be following us?

1847
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:22,310
小心  哇
Watch it! Whoa!

1848
01:45:23,190 --> 01:45:24,400
小心
Watch out!

1849
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,860
安妮  安妮
Annie! Annie.

1850
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:39,450
吉尔伯特  在这里着陆  截住他们
Gil, let's land this! Cut them off.

1851
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:44,040
我真的希望能快点找到安妮
I really hope we find Annie soon.

1852
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:47,130
不要
No!

1853
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:50,250
安妮
Annie!

1854
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:52,010
抓住他们
Get them!

1855
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:53,720
纽约警察  别动
NYPD, hold it!

1856
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:57,260
安妮
Annie!

1857
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:00,680
安妮  你没事吧  我没事  我们扯平了
Annie, are you okay? I'm fine. We even now?

1858
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:02,480
什么  还想拍照吗
What? Want another photo?

1859
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:07,900
不是这样的  亲爱的  就是这样
It's not like that, honey. It's exactly like that.

1860
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:10,520
你根本不关心我  我只不过是你的棋子
You don't care about me. I was just an opportunity to you.

1861
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,110
不是的  这不是真的  就是真的
No, that's not true. It is true.

1862
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:14,780
你对我做的这一切  都是你为了当一个愚蠢的市长
You did all this to me so you could be stupid mayor!

1863
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:16,610
不是的  听我说  你要相信我
No... Listen, you gotta trust me!

1864
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:18,370
我不会相信你的  我不会相信任何人
I can't trust you. I can't trust anybody!

1865
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:20,950
不要  让我走
No! Just let me go!

1866
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:23,830
听着  发生这种事  我很抱歉
Listen, I'm sorry for what happened to you.

1867
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:25,040
我不能看着你的眼睛
I can't look you in the eye

1868
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:26,920
跟你说我不知道发生了什么事
and tell you that I didn't know that something was going on.

1869
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,130
但是我真的不知道  他们不是你的亲生父母
But I did not know that those people weren't your parents.

1870
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,670
你要相信我
You gotta believe me.

1871
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:36,680
这就是你  安妮
This is you, Annie.

1872
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,140
这就是你
It's you.

1873
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:46,310
等等  等等
Wait, wait.

1874
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,480
先生
Sir! Sir.

1875
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:50,310
我正式宣布退出竞选市长
I officially withdraw from this mayoral race.

1876
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:55,650
我相信有人比我更适合这个职位
I think that this city deserves someone better than I am.

1877
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:57,960
我要花更多的时间
I wanna take time out to concentrate on things

1878
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,740
去关注我最重要的人
that really matter to me the most,

1879
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,530
那就是这个了不起的小女孩  安妮
and that's this amazing little girl, Annie.

1880
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,370
因为
Because...

1881
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,340
眼睛进灰了
It's kind of dusty.

1882
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,550
不是灰
No, it's not dusty.

1883
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:19,090
是我哭了
I'm crying.

1884
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:22,390
她是我的家人
That's my family.

1885
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:24,220
谢谢
Thank you.

1886
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:40,410
我还要你答应我一件事
I need one more thing from you.

1887
01:47:41,410 --> 01:47:44,990
你总是这么古灵精怪  什么事
You are always on the hustle. What is it now?

1888
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,000
别再玩游戏了
Stop playing games.

1889
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,380
噢  对  我明白了
Oh, yeah, I got this.

1890
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:58,630
你还好吗  我没事
You all right? I'm fine.

1891
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:02,120
格蕾丝  我自己总是不能很好的意识到
Grace, listen, I've always had a problem with realizing

1892
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,140
什么才是对的
what's right in front of me,

1893
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,060
我正在学习
and, well, I'm learning.

1894
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:08,640
你愿意跟我共进晚餐吗
Would you like to go out to dinner with me?

1895
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:10,810
什么
What?

1896
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:14,820
要是没有你  我一事无成
I mean, without you, I can't function.

1897
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:16,860
这不只是工作方面
That just doesn't mean work either.

1898
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:18,990
所有事  你都是对的
You're right about everything.

1899
01:48:19,070 --> 01:48:20,610
手机你说对了  盖伊你也说对了
You're right about the phone, you're right about Guy,

1900
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,780
市长竞选  你也说对了  风向你也
you're right about this mayoral race, right about the wind...

1901
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:23,870
别说了
Shut up!

1902
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,470
终于在一起了
Together at last!

1903
01:48:44,930 --> 01:48:46,810
永远在一起
Together forever!

1904
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,140
我们打个结
We're tying a knot

1905
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:51,730
他们永远也解不开
They never can sever!

1906
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:56,110
我不需要太阳把天空变蓝
I don't need sunshine now To turn my skies to blue

1907
01:48:57,110 --> 01:49:01,070
除了你  我什么都不要
I don't need anything but you!

1908
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:03,950
你用你可爱的小手
You've wrapped me around

1909
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:06,450
缠绕着我
That cute little finger

1910
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:08,910
你把我的生活  写成了歌
You've made life a song

1911
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:11,540
你让我变成一名歌手
You made me a singer!

1912
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:13,620
你不温不热
You're not warm and fuzzy

1913
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:16,250
你不是最好的女孩儿
And ain't the most shyest girl

1914
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:18,880
但是地球上没有什么
But nothing on Earth But nothing on Earth

1915
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,760
能够分离我们
Could ever divide us! Could ever divide us!

1916
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,090
今天太可怕了
Today was terrible.

1917
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:26,720
今天简直就是个噩梦
Today was a straight-up nightmare.

1918
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:28,600
但是那已成过去
But that was then But that was then

1919
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,230
因为我一直在寻找一样东西
'Cause I was looking for something 'Cause I was looking for something

1920
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:33,480
寻找我生命的最后篇章
Looking for my loose end Looking for my loose end

1921
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:36,610
但是现在除了你  我什么都不需要
Now I don't need anything but you Now I don't need anything but you

1922
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:38,070
不过后来
But that was then But that was then

1923
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,940
我一直在寻找
I was looking for something I was looking for something

1924
01:49:41,030 --> 01:49:42,990
寻找我生命的最后篇章
Looking for my loose end Looking for my loose end

1925
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:47,240
但是现在除了你  我什么都不需要
Now I don't need anything but you Now I don't need anything but you

1926
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,910
地球上没有什么
But nothing on Earth But nothing on Earth

1927
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,120
可以分离我们
Could ever divide us! Could ever divide us!

1928
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,620
地球上没有什么
But nothing on Earth But nothing on Earth

1929
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:57,590
可以分离我们
Could ever divide us! Could ever divide us!

1930
01:49:57,670 --> 01:49:59,420
地球上没有什么
But nothing on Earth But nothing on Earth

1931
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,590
可以分离我们
Could ever divide us! Could ever divide us!

1932
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:04,170
地球上没有什么
But nothing on Earth But nothing on Earth

1933
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:06,340
可以分离我们
Could ever divide us! Could ever divide us!

1934
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,520
对  很好
Yeah, all right.

1935
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:23,400
让我们跳起来
Everybody dance now

1936
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:25,990
不行  这是他们的事  妈咪
No, no. It's their thing, mami.

1937
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:28,490
终于在一起了
Together at last!

1938
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,660
永远在一起
Together forever!

1939
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,500
我们打个结
We're tying a knot

1940
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:35,580
他们永远都解不开
They never can sever! They never can sever!

1941
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,000
你俩是
You're two of a kind

1942
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,750
最幸福的一对
The happiest pair now

1943
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:43,210
就像流星一样闪亮
Like bright shooting stars

1944
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:45,220
欣喜若狂
You're floating on air now

1945
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:50,720
这就是梦想成真吗
And what's the title of the dream that just came true?

1946
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:54,640
我什么也不要
I don't need anything

1947
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:56,890
不要  不要
Anything Anything

1948
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:01,520
除了你们  我什么也不要
I don't need anything but you

1949
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:05,490
像他那样不停唱歌跳舞  他不可能赢的
Keeps singing and dancing like that, there's no way he was ever gonna win.

1950
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:10,070
这座城市充满了机遇  就靠你们去把握
"The city is full of opportunity. It's yours to take.

1951
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:12,740
明天太阳照样升起
"The sun will come out tomorrow."

1952
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,170
The sun'II come out tomorrow

1953
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:23,340
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

1954
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:25,630
There'II be sun

1955
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:29,970
Just thinkin' about tomorrow

1956
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:34,350
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow

1957
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:36,600
'Til there's none

1958
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,640
When I'm stuck with a day

1959
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:42,110
That's gray, and lonely

1960
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:45,480
I just stick out my chin and grin

1961
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:48,240
And say

1962
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,700
The sun'II come out tomorrow

1963
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:55,620
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

1964
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,500
Come what may

1965
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:01,630
Tomorrow, tomorrow! But nothing on Earth

1966
01:52:01,710 --> 01:52:04,960
I love you, tomorrow! Could ever divide us

1967
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:07,670
You're always a day away! But nothing on Earth

1968
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:10,720
Could ever divide us Tomorrow!

1969
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,640
But nothing on Earth Tomorrow!

1970
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:15,140
Could ever divide us I love you, tomorrow

1971
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:20,690
You're always a day

1972
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:21,440
Away!

1973
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:30,450
To-To-To-To-Tomorrow... Tomorrow is a day away!

1974
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:31,860
Yeah!

1975
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,290
好样的  莎佛朗
You do you, Saffron!

1976
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,500
这就是我想说的
That's what I'm talking about.
