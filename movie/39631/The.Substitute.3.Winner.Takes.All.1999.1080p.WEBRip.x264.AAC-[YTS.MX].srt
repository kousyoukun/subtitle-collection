Secretary of Defense
William Cohen reiterated

00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,665
his earlier comment
that NATO credibility

8
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,625
is now on the line
in Kosovo.

00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,878
In Washington,

Reporter #2:
As the military
buildup continues,

11
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,548
American officials
have publically warned

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,009
Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,178
that he's risking
NATO air strikes.

their sole objective
now that the latest

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,439
round of battle
seems to be over.

18
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,857
Kosovo, however,
remains...

- ( chatter )
- ( distant gunfire )

20
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,364
Yugoslavian air defenses
are far more effective

21
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,991
than those of,
say, Iraq.

22
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,577
And NATO wants to avoid
sending a green light

23
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,621

The current standoff between
the Yugoslav president

and the international
community threatens

34
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,947
to derail this work.

35
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,366
The time has come
for a reluctant NATO

36
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,618
to make some
very difficult decisions.

of 45 ethnic Albanians.

The international
outcry at the massacre

41
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:13,133
has grown only louder
since Yugoslavia started
its own investigation.

The defense secretary said
he had warned Milosevic

for the latest victim
in war-ravaged Kosovo.

48
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,067
Mourners gathered along
the rugged stretch of land

49
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,278
that had just weeks before
been the scene

50
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,321
of some of the bloodiest
fighting yet

51
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,948
in the separatist struggle.

52
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,741
The victim's father,
who has lost

53
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,244
two other children
to violence in the region,

54
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,288
cried out that he could
no longer go on living

55
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,957
and begged for those present
to end his life

56
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,168
and lay him in the grave
next to his children.

( groans )
You gotta admire
a guy like that.

68
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,845
He knows what to do
with a rifle butt.

69
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,183
It makes me
jealous when you get
all the attention.

70
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,727
Well, I tipped him.

71
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,271
That's why he gave me
that last shot in the spine.

00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,386
Man:
I don't feel anything
below my neck.

78
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,139
Why don't you just make me
a little more comfortable

79
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,977
and then you skip town
by yourself?

80
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,646
What, and give up
my favorite dance partner?

81
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,357
- Not a chance.
- I mean it, Karl.

82
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,945
Otherwise we'll both
end up dying in here.

83
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,155

My pocket.

86
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,209
That one.

87
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,135
From my last tour
in the Mekong.

88
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:08,099
I want you
to give it to Nicole,

my daughter.

90
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,271
I've been out of her life
more than in.

91
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,358
Give it to her
so she remembers

92
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,195
before I was a mercenary...

93
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,407
I was a soldier.

94
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,327
You still are, Macy.
The best.

95
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,412
Help me out here.

96
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,335
Please.

( woman grunting )

98
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,972
I'll be seeing you, kid.

99
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,100
- I'll be looking for ya.
- Do it.

100
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,145
( muffled groans )

101
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,230

Come on, come on.

108
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,181
- ( laughing )
- Woman: I think you should.

109
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,557
- Man: Oh, yeah?
- Right now.

110
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,434
Man: That's cool.
All right.

111
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,564
Teacher:
So everyone,
in some way or another,

112
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,274
is searching
for their father.

113
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,068
At least that's what
Thomas Wolfe believed.

114
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,613
And this idea
of a father quest
is dominated

115
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,908
not only in his work,
but in countless other works
of literature

116
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,036
dating back to the Bible
and before.

117
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,039
Gentlemen.

118
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,832
( laughs )

119
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,127
Thank you.

120
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,379
It's a very common theme--

121
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,466
trying to find one's father,
then connect with him,

122
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,177
and ultimately to win
his approval.

123
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,972
I came to college
to get away from my father.

124
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,934
- ( students laughing )
- That's ironic that
you say that.

125
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,395
Have you heard the adage
before that women end up
marrying their fathers?

126
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,273
Sure, they do...
in Mississippi.

127
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,445
Put the ball down.

128
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,864
Josh, thank you for that
scholarly contribution

129
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,283
from someone who obviously
hasn't read the assignment.

130
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,995
You can stay after class.
Maybe you can enlighten
me further.

131
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,790
What I meant
when I'm saying that...

132
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,750
women marry their fathers--

133
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,253
I meant that a lot of women
end up with men

134
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,796
who remind them
of their father,

135
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,214
whether it's
conscious or not.

136
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,592
Is that not in one way
considered a father quest?

137
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,844
Yeah, I went searching
for my old man last week.

138
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,596
Where'd you find him?

139
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,558
Same place I always do--
passed out in a puddle of piss

140
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,560
with a warm beer
in his hand.

141
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,812
( students laughing )

142
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,148
So you come from a family
of intellectuals.

143
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,483
Students: Ooh.

144
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,569
Let me tell you something,
all three of you--

145
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,738
playing football may
give you a free ride
in this school,

146
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,116
but in my class
you are not going
to get academic credit

147
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,909
for running
pass patterns.

148
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,828
You're this close
from failing this class.

149
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,204
All of you are.

150
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,123
And if you do,
I just want to remind you

151
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,666
that the only football
you're going to be seeing

152
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,085
is on the television
in your frat house.

153
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,212
Think about it.

154
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,928
( school bell rings )

155
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,639
- That wraps it up
for today, everybody.
- Bitch!

156
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,433
( students laughing )

157
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,274
That winds up class for today.
I'll see you all next week.

158
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,027
- Man: Dude, let's get
out of here.
- ( chatter )

159
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,329
Hey, come on!

160
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,213
Look, Miss Stewart,

161
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,258
I can't fail another class
this semester, okay?

162
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,178
I mean, if I do,
my father may cut me off.

163
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,265
All you do in this class,
Josh, is crack jokes

164
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,642
and check out my ass,

165
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,518
neither of which
is on the syllabus.

166
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,775
- Look at me, bitch!
- Get out of here.

167
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,155
Get out!

168
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,866
Didn't anyone ever
tell you not to play
with knives?

169
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,285
Karl, you son of a bitch.
I've been waiting an hour
here for you.

170
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,997
Hey, Rahmel.

171
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,166
Damn, it's good
to see you.

172
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,085
For a while there,
I thought they got
you and Macy.

173
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,129
No.
Did you find anything
on his daughter?

174
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,256
Yeah.

175
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,216
She's a professor
at Eastern Atlantic College.

176
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,760
- Address and phone number?
- Everything's in there.

177
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,178
Great.

178
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,723
You know, a disaster
like at Kosovo

179
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,641
makes me want to do
one thing.

180
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,436
What's that?

181
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,230
Go back for more.

182
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,157
Professor Stewart?
Nicole Stewart?

183
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,242
Yes, my name
is Karl Thomasson.

184
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,995
I knew your father.

185
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,289
Is there some place
we could meet?

186
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,458
I have something
he wanted me to give to you.

187
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,334
( rock music playing )

188
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,254
Lunch date stand you up?

189
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,631
Relax.
We just want
to talk to you.

190
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,052
Then call me
during office hours.

191
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,305
- Jock: Ooh.
- ( jock #2 chuckles )

192
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,102
You're new on campus,
so you might be interested

193
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,271
in learning what's what
around here.

194
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,065
Yeah, like Reality 101.

195
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,235
See, we've got
a winning football team,

196
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,738
the first winning team
this school's had
in a long time,

197
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,239
and we're a big part
of it.

198
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,617
Yeah, so why are you
riding us so hard, huh?

199
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,119
Don't you got
no school spirit, bitch?

200
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,371
I'm a college professor,
not a cheerleader.

201
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,125
( cup clatters )

202
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,211
Jock:
Are you even
listening to us?

203
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,507
Jock #2:
We make a lot of money
for this school.

204
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,801
We pay your salary.

205
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,136
So you better get
with the program

206
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,765
or it's going to be your ass
that gets thrown out of here.

207
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,231
Excuse me.

208
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,901
I'm collecting
for the local blood bank.

209
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,820
Anyone care
to make a donation?

210
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,201
- Man: Oh, no.
- Woman: Oh, no.

211
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,329
Eh, I left my wallet
in my locker.

212
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,791
Well, I wasn't
talking about money.

213
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,334
Ah!

214
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,092
Oh!

215
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,981
- Hey.
- Jock: Oh, damn.

216
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,191
You're dead!

217
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,827
- Sorry.
- Eh, no problem. Hoo.

218
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,170
Nicole?
I'm Karl Thomasson.

219
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,172
- Hi.
- Hello.

220
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:48,846
- What was that all about?
- Oh, they're students of mine.
Football players.

221
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,598
They're mad at me
because I expect them

222
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,850
to do the same work
as everybody else.

223
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,226
Well, if it's
any consolation,

224
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,729
they'll be
on the disabled list
for a while.

225
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,731
Well, actually,
it's not.

226
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,317
The school administrators
encourage them to think
that way

227
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,360
and the dean doesn't
come right out and say it,

228
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,071
but the message
is very clear.

229
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,074
Maybe you didn't notice,
but those guys were
completely wired.

230
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,660
Maybe it was coke,
maybe it was steroids,

231
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,121
but they were
totally out of control.

232
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,832
Why don't you let me
deal with them?

233
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,336
I've had enough military
intervention in my life,
thank you very much.

234
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,380
I can take care of myself.
I always have.

235
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,342
Like today?

236
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:30,971
Players:
Break!

237
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,266
There's no way that bitch
is going to pass us now,

238
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,018
even if we made up
the work.

239
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,312
Yeah, my eyes are still
burning from the pizza joint.

240
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,231
I'm gonna have
to kill that guy
next time I see him.

241
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,609
We've got to do something
about that teacher, man.

242
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,236
- Get her off our backs.
- Yeah, you're right.

243
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,072
What do you do
when someone's standing

244
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,116
between you
and the end zone?

245
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,202
You chop block his ass
into next week.

246
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,329
Send him home
on a stretcher.

247
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,123
Hey, what about Tony?

248
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,585
You know, Tony usually
fixes things like this
all the time.

249
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,879
Nah, I want a piece
of that bitch myself.

250
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,173
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

251
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,175
Just what are you
doing here?

252
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,222
Your father wanted me
to give you this.

253
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,475
Mm. Yeah.

254
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,561
I have a deeper relationship
with my dry cleaner

255
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,438
than I did with my father.

256
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,191
He moved out of the house
before I even could say
his name.

257
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,735
He'd drop back in
every two or three years

258
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,029
and hang around
just long enough
to make it look like

259
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,240
he was going to start
acting like a father.

260
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,326
And every time
I believed him,
that phone would ring

261
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,120
and he'd be right back
out the door.

262
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,832
He was a professional soldier
and a damn good one.

263
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,500
Just like you, huh?

264
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,466
Look, I don't know what kind
of deathbed promise

265
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,344
my father wrung out
of you, but here and now

266
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,806
I am absolving you
of your obligation, okay?

267
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,266
Okay.

268
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,187
I'd like to keep this
to remind me of him,

269
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,274
except I have no idea
who he is.

270
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,527
Keep it.

271
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,529
It means
something to you.

272
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,706
( yelling, grunting )

273
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,377
( whistle blows )

274
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,350
( whistle blows )

275
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,735
( whistle blows )

276
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,030
Set. Hut!

277
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,157
All right.
Keep your legs moving.

278
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,369
Man:
Do it, Bo!
Do it!

279
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,956
( whistle blows )

280
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,916
What the hell was that,
Robinson?

281
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,253
You may look like
the Michelin Man, but you hit
like the Pillsbury Doughboy.

282
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,006
Now get in there
and hit somebody.
Come on.

283
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,092
- Man: Come on, Bo!
- Man #2: Knock him on his ass!

284
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,301
( players yelling )

285
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,095
Come on, get him, Bo!
Get him now!

286
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,264
- Come on, Bo, get him!
- Knock his ass over, Bo!

287
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,061
( whistle blows )

288
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,271
Well, I guess we're just going
to have to widen the bench,

289
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,899
because that's where
your fat ass is going
to be planted come Saturday.

290
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,696
- Everybody, listen up!
- ( players shouting )

291
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,574
- ( whistles ) Listen up.
- ( shouting stops )

292
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,910
If you're not willing
to put your body on the line

293
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,162
every time you line up,
I don't want you
on the field.

294
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,207
If you're not willing to do
anything and everything
it takes to win,

295
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,458
I don't want you
on this team.

296
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,210
- You understand that?
- Players: Yes, sir!

297
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,130
Good. Because if you're
not willing to put
this football team

298
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,589
above everything else
in your life,

299
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,258
I don't really care
if you live or die.

300
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,634
- Do you understand that?
- Players: Yes, sir!

301
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,552
Good.

302
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:01,140
- Robinson, are you willing
to put your body on the line?
- Yes, sir!

303
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,600
- Are you willing to do
everything it takes to win?
- Yes, sir!

304
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,353
- Is this football team more
important than everything?
- Yes, sir!

305
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,397
- Then get in there
and hit somebody!
- ( yelling )

306
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,315
( players yelling )

307
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,570
You hit or you sit!
Do you understand that?

308
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,073
( grunting )

309
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,203
You're dead!

310
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,164
Man:
Get him, Bo!
Kill him!

311
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,340
Do it, Bo!

312
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,183
They'll be here
in an hour.

313
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,231
( whistle blows )

314
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,234
- Okay, that's enough.
- ( whistle blows )

315
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,153
All right, that's enough.
Break it up.

316
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,906
Let's save it for Saturday.

317
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,158
You guys are lifting weights.
Hit the iron.

318
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
The rest of you take a lap.
Let's go, hustle up.

319
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,995
Man:
Come on, man!

320
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,623
Parker, Phillips,
come here.

321
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,249
Hustle.

322
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,131
- Phillips: What's up, Coach?
- I just got word we got
a random urine test

323
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,133
this afternoon
for you and Parker.

324
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,886
Athletic Association boys
will be here in about an hour.

325
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:25,057
One more thing, I got
another grade warning report
from your English professor.

326
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,976
Says you're about this close
from academic ineligibility.

327
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,937
Now listen to me.

328
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,314
We're coming into
the home stretch of my first
winning season in years

329
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,399
and I can't afford
to lose you boys.

330
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,568
- Am I making myself clear?
- Yeah.

331
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,445
- We'll take care of it, Coach.
- You better be.

332
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,949
- Now go get ready
for the test.
- All right.

333
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,080
You know what--
I wish someone

334
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,207
would make these guys
take a random drug test.

335
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,209
- ( toilet flushes )
- Maybe they'd find a couple
of female chromosomes

336
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,379
floating around in their piss
and somebody could tell
their wives about it.

337
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,426
- Here, I got it.
Go get yours.
- All right.

338
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,019
Dude, how do you
get a job like that?

339
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,771
Man:
Is that right?

340
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,815
( engine starts )

341
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,361
( chatter, laughter )

342
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,749
Man:
Over here.

343
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,172
Psst.

344
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,971
- Hey.
- ( screams )

345
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,312
Maybe hire ourselves
out for a private gig
down in the Gulf?

346
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,191
Work for one of those
big oil companies,
you know?

347
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,447
You're killin' me.

348
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,659
Good run.

349
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,745
Karl: Hey,
that's Macy's daughter.

350
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,206
- She going to be all right?
- Doctor: Eventually.

351
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,293
With the internal injuries
she's suffered, coupled
with the concussion

352
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,420
and broken ribs,
she's not going to be
leaving anytime soon.

353
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,213
Would you mind if we stay
with her for a while?

354
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,341
Actually,
it's very reassuring
to have family around

355
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,176
when a patient regains
consciousness.

356
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,553
I'll be back
to check on her
in a couple of minutes.

357
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,638
( heart monitor beeping )

358
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,488
( man yelling )

359
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,619
- ( breathing heavily )
- ( man yelling )

360
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,627
- No.
- ( laughing )

361
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,130
No.
( groaning )

362
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,841
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right.

363
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,180
You're all right, okay?

364
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,520
Okay.

365
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,158
Well, boss...

366
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,786
looks like we've got
ourselves a mission.

367
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,623
- ( knocks on door )
- Hey! Come on in!

368
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,834
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, Ed.

369
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,294
- ( dog barking )
- I'm on with my bookie.
Hold on a minute.

370
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,255
Yeah, what's the line?

371
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,257
All right. Good.
Give me 50 on them.

372
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,717
No, I don't care
how many games
they've lost.

373
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,011
- I do my research, pal.
- ( beeps )

374
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,431
- Shithead.
- Research?

375
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,350
Yeah, I've got a bug
in his office and a tap
on his phone,

376
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,561
so whatever he gets
on the inside comes to me.

377
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,938
So what's up, fellas?

378
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,731
Well, we need to get
inside the football program

379
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,068
- at Eastern Atlantic College.
- Eastern Atlantic?

380
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,364
Yeah, and when do you need
these installations by?

381
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,117
- Monday.
- Oh, come on.

382
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,870
You know, you're really
cutting into my weekend
sports viewing here.

383
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,498
Sit down.
Take a load off.
Make yourself at home.

384
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,676
So, why the sudden interest
in college athletics?

385
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,136
- You remember Macy?
- Yeah.

386
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,263
His daughter's
a professor there.

387
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,890
She was assaulted
last night.

388
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,683
I think it was one
of the football players

389
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,060
and I'd kind of like
to know which one.

390
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:42,397
Eastern Atlantic.
Yeah, they're having
a hell of a season.

391
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,233
They've got
this lineman kid,
Bo Robinson.

392
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,027
He's built like
a wall with legs.

393
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,987
Now, the word is
he got this way juicing.

394
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,531
Sounds like junior's
been taking steroids.

395
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,074
Yeah, that's what they say
about every kid

396
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,077
that gains 60 pounds
of muscle in less than a year.

397
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,788
- You know, I'm going to
need back-up on this.
- Whatever you want.

398
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,207
Rahmel will cover you.

399
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,250
I'm going to go in,
get close to him.

400
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,627
- You're going in?
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,420
As what?
A janitor?

402
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,090
No, Ed.
A professor.

403
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,510
I'm taking over
Nicole's classes
while she's out.

404
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,803
A pro-- professor?
How are you going
to pull that off?

405
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,014
I have a doctorate
in contemporary literature.

406
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,683
- No way.
- Way.

407
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,229
Oh, yeah,
he's an undercover
stealth teacher.

408
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,650
I could have been
a college professor,
you know.

409
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,154
You guys hungry?

410
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,576
- What?
- Karl: Let us know when
you got something, Ed.

411
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,662
- What did I say?
- Rahmel: We'll call ya.

412
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,046
- So she said--
- Move it, punk.

413
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,298
- Hey, what's up?
- Get your ass
out of the way, punk.

414
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,175
Do you believe
these guys?

415
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,594
Running around here
thinking they can do
whatever they want to you.

416
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,361
( chatter )

417
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,118
Oh, you must be
Professor Stewart's
substitute.

418
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,996
- Bill Braden,
head football coach.
- Oh, hi. Dan Cooper.

419
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,374
Man, get your punk ass
out of my way.

420
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,794
Yo, Free Willy,
wanna give me a break
over here or what?

421
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,546
Man, what you say?
What did you call me?

422
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,214
- Free--
- Oh, sh--

423
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,882
Let me tell you
something now.

424
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,135
When you see me
coming down here,
you better step off

425
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,928
before I have to
bust your skinny ass.

426
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,764
Bo, Bo,
chill out, man.

427
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,142
You know Josh is my buddy
from high school.

428
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,937
Well, he's about
to get his beat-down.

429
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,525
- Jesus, man.
- Sorry about that, man.

430
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,069
You just need to
bulk up a little bit.

431
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,863
Bo, what's up?
Word.

432
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,906
- That game
was fat on Saturday.
- Back up off me.

433
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,824
- Who you callin' fat?
- Dude, Bo, not you, man.

434
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,578
Boy, you guys have really
turned it around this year--
six and one.

435
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,122
- You must be excited.
- Well, that's why I thought
we'd have a little chat.

436
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,334
You got three
of my first-stringers in
the class you're taking over.

437
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,003
Now, from what I hear,
you're a great teacher
and we're lucky to have you,

438
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,173
but I've got to tell you,
it's not an Ivy League school,
you know?

439
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,217
- Have you got lunch in here?
- Uh, yeah.

440
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,720
- You got enough for everybody?
- No, just you, Bo.

441
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,556
Yeah, I don't need that.

442
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,558
You were a damn good corner
in high school.

443
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,977
How come you haven't
tried out for the team
the last couple seasons?

444
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,646
I had to bulk
up my grades, man.
That's what I need.

445
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,148
Pssh, dude,
if you're on the team,

446
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,233
you don't have to worry
about any of that crap.

447
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,820
- Didn't seem that way here
in Stewart's class.
- Where is she now?

448
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,490
A winning football team
provides good, clean fun
for everybody--

449
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,867
students, players,
not to mention the alumni

450
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,370
that contributes lots
of money to departments
like yours and ours.

451
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,246
Well, I think I get
what you're driving at.

452
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,416
Good 'cause I'm just hoping
you'll cut my players
a little slack.

453
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,378
Like Professor McMurdo here.

454
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,129
He's one of our
biggest boosters.

455
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,964
- Wayne McMurdo.
- Dan Cooper.

456
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,259
- Follows every game.
- When my schedule permits.

457
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:02,180
( chuckles )
So if you need anything,
like tickets, just let me know.

458
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,099
Oh, don't worry, Coach.

459
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,810
I know this is going to be
a memorable season.

460
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,273
- Bo: You got
more money in there?
- Student: No, man.

461
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,775
- You sure?
- I gave it all to you.

462
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,276
- You got it all.
- It's all in here?

463
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,779
- You sure? You sure?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

464
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,863
Excuse me.

465
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,782
- You got it all.
- You sure?

466
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,951
- Oh, yeah.
- Excuse me!

467
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,452
( chatter stops )

468
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,954
Is there a problem?

469
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,208
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, I'm talking to you.

470
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,586
Hey, man, here.
Sit your ass down.

471
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,755
That's the guy
from the pizza parlor.

472
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,762
- No problem.
- Then sit down.

473
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,645
Hey, do that again
and you're out of here.

474
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,523
- And you'll fail
for the semester.
- Whatever.

475
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,817
- Ooh.
- Man: Tough guy.

476
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,529
As you all know,
Professor Stewart
has been hospitalized.

477
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,072
For the rest
of the semester,

478
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,449
I'm going to be
her replacement.

479
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,617
Let's see how long
he lasts.

480
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,703
My name
is Professor Cooper.

481
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,747
Give me that, man.

482
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,084
Let's get started.

483
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,837
"This is the patent age
of new inventions

484
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,506
for killing bodies,
and for saving souls.

485
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,718
All propagated
with the best intentions."

486
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,178
- Who said that?
- You did.

487
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,555
( class laughs )

488
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,016
That's right, but not until
after Byron said it.

489
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,893
- Man, who the fuck is Byron?
- Now, can anybody tell me

490
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,394
how that relates
to your last assignment--

491
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,938
the story of
"The Quiet American."

492
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,108
- Yes.
- The story shows us

493
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,778
how our failure
in Vietnam

494
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,738
was due to our...

495
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,364
arrogance as a culture.

496
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,366
We overestimated
our strength

497
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,912
and underestimated
the enemy's will to prevail.

498
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,581
Good. Was that Cliffs
or Monarch?

499
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,168
- Cliffs.
- I like Cliffs.

500
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,004
Yeah? What does that
have to do with anything?

501
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,381
( laughs )

502
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,093
Well, after Grenada,
Libya, and the Gulf War,

503
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,222
a lot of people
have begun to fear that
that same attitude

504
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,140
is becoming prevalent again
in America today.

505
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,559
Hey, we only lost Vietnam

506
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,145
because of hippies
and draft dodgers.

507
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,939
And you wouldn't see
that crap today.

508
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,483
- So, uh, what's your name?
- Jeremy.

509
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,735
So, Jeremy, you're saying
that domestic unrest

510
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,986
undermined
the military abroad.

511
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,363
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

512
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,656
And where
did you learn that?

513
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,908
From one of your
political science professors?

514
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,286
- "Rambo."
- Man: There's a role model.

515
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,289
Nice.

516
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,959
"Rambo."

517
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,961
Hmm.

518
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,255
- Stand up.
- Me?

519
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,882
No, you.

520
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,094
- Stand up.
- No, you don't want
none of me, man.

521
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,013
Oh, yes, I do.
Stand up.

522
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,141
- Man: He's callin' you out.
- Do it, Bo.

523
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:56,145
- I'm up.
- Okay. Let's move these desks
as far back as we can.

524
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,898
- Man: That's what
I'm talkin' about!
- Make some room.

525
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,942
- Move them back.
- Take him out, man.

526
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,360
Yeah, nigga.

527
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,779
All right, now, Bo--

528
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,155
it is Bo, isn't it?

529
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,617
- Yeah, that's right.
- Come on up here to me.

530
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,328
( class laughing )

531
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,082
( class whooping )

532
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,167
Shit.

533
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:22,672
Okay, now, we're going
to test Jeremy's theory.

534
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,092
A second chance
at the same situation.

535
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,427
Bo, you're going
to represent America

536
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,387
with all of its military
and industrial might,

537
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,891
and I am going to be
a very small guerilla force--

538
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,434
no technology, no tanks,
no helicopters,

539
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,478
sometimes no guns.

540
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,190
All I have is my will
to prevail.

541
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,153
- Hit me.
- Students: Ooh!

542
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,989
- Karl: Come on.
- Slap him, Bo. Do it, man.

543
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,284
- Take him out.
- You all heard me say it.

544
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,202
You all heard me say it.
Didn't you, class?

545
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,454
Did you hear me say it?

546
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,082
I told him to hit me.
Come on, Bo, hit me.

547
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,212
Yeah. I'm gonna enjoy
kicking your ass.

548
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,758
- Man: Whoa!
Come on, Bo.
- ( grunting )

549
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,678
- Come on.
- I told you to hit me, Bo.

550
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,639
You don't want
a failing grade, do you?

551
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,307
- Woman: Here he comes.
- Man: He's fast.

552
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,101
- He's gonna kill him now.
- ( grunts )

553
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,895
Come on, Bo!

554
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,357
- Come on, man.
- Get up! Get up, Bo!

555
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,192
Jeez, Bo.
I'm disappointed in you.

556
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,611
I thought football players
were supposed to hit.

557
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,364
Maybe you can
only hit people when
you're coming from behind.

558
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,534
( growls, yelling )

559
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,537
( gasps )

560
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,209
Well, Jeremy,
it looks like your thesis

561
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,294
doesn't hold up
to empirical research.

562
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,213
( groaning )

563
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,091
You see,
a true guerilla force

564
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,718
- owns the night.
- ( groans )

565
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,179
Attacking the enemy

566
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,181
when he's blind
and can't see.

567
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,808
- ( yelling )
- ( gasping )

568
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,227
Oh!

569
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,699
Come on, man.
Get up. Come on.

570
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,492
Now you all saw
what I did.

571
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,953
I never initiated contact
with the enemy.

572
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,205
I forced him to pursue me,

573
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,541
to fight me on my terms,
not his.

574
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,962
That's how the VC
and the Afghans and Castro

575
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,006
and even our own forefathers
here in America

576
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,926
prevailed over
vastly superior armies.

577
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,428
Any questions?

578
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,892
Good.

579
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,187
What in the hell
was that all about?

580
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:49,110
Yeah. If that isn't the guy
from the pizza parlor,
I'm Snow White.

581
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,279
So he acted like
he had no problem,

582
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,033
like he understood
the situation,

583
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,077
but he was playing me.

584
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,621
He was playing me
like a fool.

585
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,209
- ( car horn honking )
- Braden: I'll get in
the faculty office

586
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,836
and dig up
everything I can.

587
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,212
Let's go.

588
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:12,550
- ( beeping )
- Come on, keep going.

589
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,511
Hey, Coach, I thought you
were going to meet a guy
about those vitamins.

590
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,889
We're, uh, getting low.

591
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,434
I want two more
of those sets.

592
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:25,354
Rahmel, Elvis
has left the building.

593
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,356
Stick with him.

594
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,030
I have a feeling
he's not going to
the health food store.

595
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,324
Got him.

596
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,709
- One more, one more.
- ( grunting )

597
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,172
That's it.

598
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,328
- ( grunting )
- Seven!

599
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,997
- ( others cheering )
- Eight!

600
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,250
- Nine!
- Come on, come on.

601
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,753
- Push!
- Come on, Josh!

602
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,213
Push!

603
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,676
( all shouting )

604
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,407
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Yeah!

605
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,576
Give me some, Bo!
Give me some! Yeah!

606
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,370
- ( all cheering )
- Right on! Yeah!

607
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,921
So while I monitored
the locker room,

608
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,798
Rahmel tailed Braden.

609
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,050
And that's when
he made this buy here.

610
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,677
Karl: Bingo.

611
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,053
Ed:
Yeah, so I figured
Braden would return

612
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,055
to the athletic building,
and that was great.

613
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,891
I could keep my eyes
and ears on him.

614
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,518
And I tailed the dealer
and he was one busy guy.

615
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,771
Karl: And you think it was
steroids he was dealing?

616
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,273
( scoffs )
By the gallon.

617
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,443
That guy could have been
dealing anything to those kids.

618
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:39,030
I wondered about that myself,
so I took up a collection.

619
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,044
And those are steroids,
all right.

620
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,712
What happened to the dealer?
Where did he disappear to?

621
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,174
- Sports bar on Soldier Hill.
- The Brass Ball.

622
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,510
- Yeah.
- Ah, shit. These guys
are Soldier Hill boys.

623
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,304
Yeah. They're a crew
that operates out of there.

624
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,473
They're run by this kid--
Tony Lo Russo.

625
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,183
They call him Tony Lo.

626
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,769
Yeah, and his old man
is Vinny "The Brick."

627
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,021
He's a capo
in the Marsono family.

628
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,233
- They operate
under his flag.
- Vinny "The Brick"?

629
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,277
Yeah. It's his
weapon of choice.

630
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,029
You know, some people
use ice picks.

631
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,031
He got his rep
using a brick.

632
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,325
( laughing )

633
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,954
He's also got
some legitimate businesses.

634
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,997
Earthmoving
equipment mostly.

635
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,167
Where is this legitimate
earthmoving business at?

636
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,169
He's got a warehouse
over on Industry Road.

637
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,130
Ed, can we get a DV camera
and a condenser microphone
in the bar?

638
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,259
Something selective
that can cut through
ambient noise.

639
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,803
- Yeah.
- Rahmel: You know, something
that might be a little better

640
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,222
is to get somebody
undercover in there.

641
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,848
You know, somebody
that can get close to him.

642
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,809
I wonder what Andy's up to?

643
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,561
Are you fucking kidding me?
You want me to pose

644
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,480
as a waitress
in a fucking titty bar?

645
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,066
- No, a sports bar.
- Yeah, right.

646
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,069
- Okay. Sports and titties.
- See.

647
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,948
Come on. These guys have been
selling illegal steroids
all over campus.

648
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,785
I think there's a chance
they might involved in the
attack on Macy's daughter.

649
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,327
- I see.
- ( grunts )

650
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,078
- Incredible point man.
- That's right.

651
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,291
- What do you say? Come on.
- Come on, Karl. Look at me.

652
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,126
I can't pose as a waitress
in a titty bar.

653
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,044
I mean, in order to work
in a place like that,

654
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,171
you've got to have a bra size
bigger than your IQ.

655
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,173
Andy, come on.
I need you on this one.

656
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:25,720
- Where have I
heard that before?
- This time I really mean it.

657
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,139
- Why do I always have
to do the undercover stuff?
- You're the best at it.

658
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,934
- Besides, who am I going
to send in? Ed?
- It's an idea.

659
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,687
Come on. Please.
I need you on this one.
Come on.

660
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:43,446
Gentlemen, tonight's specials
are double shots of tequila

661
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,990
- and me.
- I owe you.

662
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,326
Nah, you don't owe me.

663
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,121
- ( grunts )
- ( groans )

664
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:58,044
- Oh, boy.
- You owe me big-time.

665
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,628
I hate when you do that.

666
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,092
- Hey.
- What's up?

667
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:09,263
I'm from Derosa's Amusements.
I'm here to fix your jukebox.

668
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,183
- My what?
- Your jukebox. The thing
that plays the music.

669
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,518
Oh, well. Come on.

670
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,399
Ah!

671
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,787
- You look stronger.
- Mm. That's encouraging,

672
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,082
considering I feel
like a freight train
just ran over me.

673
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,252
You know, this is very nice
of you and everything,

674
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,922
but shouldn't you be off
assassinating someone?

675
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,133
Listen to me.

676
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,428
Your father saved
my life more than once.

677
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,430
He was a good friend.
Besides, I owe him.

678
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,100
I owe his memory,
but that does not
give you the right

679
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,811
to talk to me
like one of your
undergraduates.

680
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,733
You're right.
I'm sorry.

681
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,194
I apologize.
That was uncalled for.

682
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,113
( sighs )

683
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,241
- It's just that--
- What?

684
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,331
I've just
had better days.

685
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,294
We're going to find
the people that did this
to you, Nicole.

686
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,257
Yeah, and then what?

687
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,259
And then you go back
to leading a normal life.

688
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,973
You know, I've never
had a normal life.

689
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,601
Ed: Okey-dokey.
It looks good to me.
( humming )

690
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,818
- Better?
- Mm-hmm.

691
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,196
You know, sometimes
I say things that...

692
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,825
- You don't mean?
- Oh, no. I always
mean them.

693
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,286
I just shouldn't say them.

694
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:58,247
I do appreciate
what you're doing for me.

695
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,292
- Honest.
- I believe you.

696
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,044
I'm gonna go.

697
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,383
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

698
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,218
( intermittent traffic
blaring )

699
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,305
Did you know that steroids
cause testicular atrophy?

700
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,265
What do you mean?
They make your nuts shrink?

701
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,435
- That's right.
- My ex-wife

702
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,312
had the same effect on me.

703
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,400
( chuckling )

704
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,486
- ( chatter )
- ( machine beeping )

705
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,448
Well, what do you think?

706
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,825
I think it's time
to go to work.

707
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,954
( coin clinking )

708
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,998
( music playing )

709
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,878
- Ed: Say hello.
- Karl: Rahmel, can you hear me?

710
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,881
You know,
you're very photogenic.

711
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,133
If that's an offer,
I'm flattered,

712
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,968
but I already
have plans for tonight.

713
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,513
( chuckles )

714
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,642
How do the Chinese eat
with these damn things?

715
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,061
American fork.

716
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:07,358
Look at Andy in that getup.
Madon'. I never knew that--

717
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,152
- knew that Andy was--
- What?

718
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,572
Well, you know,
she's got such, uh...

719
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,533
- Ed, they're fake.
- What?

720
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,702
- They're fake.
They're not real.
- No.

721
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,204
Karl:
Oh, yeah. Watch this.

722
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:24,166
Andy, you're listing
to starboard.

723
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,464
Perfect. Good.

724
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,092
If I had those,
I'd love to touch them.

725
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,057
That's Tony Lo Russo
in the baseball cap.

726
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,143
Karl:
Mel, that's our target
holding court at the bar.

727
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,064
( cash register dings )

728
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,233
No, I shit you not.

729
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,235
A Komodo dragon's
got three penises.

730
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,988
- Bullshit.
- I saw it on TV.

731
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,073
And there are three bitches
for each male.

732
00:42:56,115 --> 00:43:00,035
- One for each dick.
- I wish I had three dicks.

733
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,537
Why? You only got
two hands.

734
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,167
More peanuts?

735
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,170
Excuse me.

736
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,300
Thanks.

737
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,262
Whoa.

738
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,264
Did you see the headlights
on that 4x4?

739
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,766
That's what I call
an off-road vehicle.

740
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,814
- They ain't even real.
- What are you talkin'
about, not real?

741
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,774
She's stuffed
like a fucking turkey.

742
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,326
- I say she's real.
- All right.

743
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,911
I may be wrong.
Okay?

744
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,372
The lighting's not that good
in here, you know?

745
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,339
- Tough guy.
- Hmm.

746
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,716
- Hey, Jerry.
- Yeah.

747
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,551
Hey, who's the new meatloaf?

748
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,137
Eh, Susie something or other.
I hired her this morning.

749
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,056
- Want me to call her over?
- No.

750
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,309
- Why don't you just get
the show started?
- All right.

751
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,688
- Let's have a show.
- Yeah.

752
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,190
( groans )

753
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,403
Andrea, you know,
you look marvelous.

754
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,155
You really do.

755
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,909
Tony's asking about you,
so keep workin' him.
You're doing great.

756
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,787
All right, everybody.
You know what time it is.

757
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,122
It's time
for our girls to get...

758
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,542
- All: Wet and wild!
- ( crowd cheers )

759
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,544
Yeah!

760
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,007
All right!

761
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,552
Let's bring up
our first contestant...
Tiffany.

762
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:49,269
- Here we go, baby.
- ( giggles )

763
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,272
Yeah, baby!

764
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,655
- ( whistling )
- Don't worry about the water
if it gets on the floor.

765
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,949
See, we collect it all
and then we freeze it

766
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,160
and we turn it
into ice cubes for, uh--
for cocktails.

767
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,454
So order up, huh?

768
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:24,179
Next up...
the lovely Georgia.

769
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,265
( crowd cheers )

770
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,561
- Let her have it!
- ( moans )

771
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,194
- Look at the size
of those things.
- Mm-hmm.

772
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,618
Don't worry, Georgia.
The South's going to
rise again

773
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,746
along with every one
of these jamokes

774
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,330
in this room
right now. Huh?

775
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,127
Man:
Georgia!

776
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,089
All right.
Thank you, honey.

777
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,052
Okay. Some fun, huh?
All right.

778
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,347
Now it is my pleasure
to introduce the newest member

779
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:11,143
of the Brass Ball Bar...
Susie.

780
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,103
( crowd cheers )

781
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,242
( giggles )

782
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,795
May I?

783
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,506
Man:
She's doing the Lewinsky.

784
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:47,054
Jerry:
There you go!
Thank you, Susie.

785
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,185
Let's make her happy.

786
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,771
Boys, make enough noise
so the new girl wins.

787
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,026
Is our lucky winner
going to be...

788
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,111
Tiffany?

789
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,866
Or is it
going to be Georgia?

790
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,287
Get ready to clap.

791
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,666
Or how about
the new kid, Susie?

792
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,425
( giggles )

793
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,261
Thank you, girls. Thank you.

794
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,137
( mimics barking )

795
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,350
Jerry:
Our winner is Susie Hammer.

796
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,145
I'm so proud of Andy
for winning that prize.

797
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,524
You know, actually,
I prefer Tiffany.

798
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,068
Really? I would
have thought Georgia.

799
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,947
( screams, gasps )

800
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,949
( laughs )

801
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,077
Jerry:
Thank you, Susie.
All righty.

802
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,246
I'm gonna
get some of that.

803
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,291
Drink up. Come on, drink up.
We're having fun here.

804
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,170
I like a woman
who can turn you on

805
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,965
and scare the living shit
out of you all at
the same time.

806
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,726
I can't believe I just
did that. I've never done
anything like that.

807
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:19,354
- My heart is just pounding.
- I bet a drink would
settle you down.

808
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,816
- Come on, I'm buying.
- I don't think Mr. Sundheim
would appreciate that.

809
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,235
I'm right in the middle
of my shift.

810
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,654
Jerry happens to be
a personal friend of mine.

811
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,990
Matter of fact, my father
and I are something like

812
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,284
silent partners
here at the club.

813
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,703
If I ask,
he'll be happy to do it.

814
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,457
Well, I suppose
if you're a partner.

815
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,083
What's your name?

816
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,461
Susie. Susie Hammer.

817
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:46,423
( chuckles )
Hammer. Like bang, bang?

818
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,304
I apologize for these guys.
Sometimes they get a little
carried away.

819
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,181
Oh, that's okay.

820
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,100
Sometimes I get
a little carried away, too.

821
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,186
Well, this is Petey boy.

822
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:02,731
This is Robbie.
Smooth talker here
is Frankie G

823
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,733
and that's Jimmy.

824
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,276
And I'm Tony.

825
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,195
- Hi.
- Hi.

826
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:11,281
So what would you like?

827
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:15,285
Whatever you want.

828
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,996
Hey, Jerry. Champagne.

829
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,541
Tony, we don't
have any champagne.

830
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:25,295
- Well, then get some.
- I'll see what I got.

831
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,715
Excuse me, Mr. Lo Russo.
I need to--

832
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,551
if I could have
just a moment of your time.

833
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,722
- This is Mr. Kirby.
- Who the hell is this guy?

834
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,350
- A professor.
- What's he teach?

835
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,268
I'll lay you odds
it's chemistry.

836
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,062
What kind of odds
are we talkin' here?

837
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,314
Have you ever sought
professional help
for your problem?

838
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,400
- What problem?
- Your gambling problem.

839
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,069
I don't have a problem.
I never lose.

840
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:56,243
Mr. Kirby
is very essential
to my work.

841
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,287
He provides many
of the raw materials
that I use to--

842
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,248
- I can handle this.
- All right.

843
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,542
Let's talk business.

844
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:07,421
Back in my office, though.
Here, have a seat, baby.

845
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,257
- Hey, Jerry, you make sure
she gets her champagne.
- Jerry: Yeah, I'm on it.

846
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,593
- Let's go back here.
- Hey, Tony.

847
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:19,391
Professor, why don't you
have a drink? On me. Huh?

848
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,812
Yeah, it's just right back
over here.

849
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,243
- Talk to me.
- Cost of doing business
just went up.

850
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,121
Yeah? Well, how high up?

851
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,206
- Double what I'm gettin' now.
- Double.

852
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,375
That's a pretty sharp
increase.

853
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,628
Yeah.
Supply and demand.

854
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,716
I'm the only guy
you got to give McMurdo
what he needs.

855
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,010
So you're trying to tell me
you're the only guy

856
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,221
on this entire planet
who can do what you do?

857
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,516
- Take it or leave it.
- Thank you.

858
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,478
Well, let me think about it.

859
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,942
( coin clinks,
jazz music playing )

860
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,861
( sighs )

861
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,950
Isn't that nice?

862
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,748
Frankie, this beer
tastes like shit.

863
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,752
If you don't mind,
I'm just going to
get rid of it.

864
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,713
Hey, mook.

865
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,925
- ( Kirby groaning )
- ( glass shatters )

866
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,309
You come in this place--
you try to lean on me,

867
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,437
you piece of shit.
You little piece of shit!

868
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,692
- ( Kirby screaming )
- ( yelling )

869
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,656
All right, all right.

870
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,367
Clean this piece of shit up
and put him in the car.

871
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,044
Rahmel, stay with Andy.
Ed and I will take
the professor.

872
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,921
Whoo!

873
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,968
I need a shot!
Let's go! Give me a shot!

874
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,427
You want a shot?
Let's get you a shot.

875
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,555
Let's go. Let's have
some shots, little boys.

876
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,100
Let's go. Come on.
Here you are.

877
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,894
- Thanks.
- You're in great shape.

878
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,604
You must work out.
I like that.

879
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,773
- Yeah, I love to work out.
- Yeah?

880
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:35,068
- Do you?
- Eh, yeah. I'll tell you
a little secret.

881
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,572
If you want to really bulk up,
you've got to juice.

882
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,282
- I like juice.
- Yeah?

883
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,492
As long as I'm the one
doing the squeezing.

884
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:46,079
Maybe you could
squeeze me sometime.

885
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,498
Oh, a man like you
I could squeeze dry.

886
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,007
- Hey, Tony.
- Don't you see
I'm talkin' over here?

887
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,759
Tony, it's your old man.

888
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,931
- Oh, shit.
- Oops.

889
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,392
Pop, over here.

890
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,196
Hey, Vince.
Looking good.

891
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,124
Where's the rest
of the boys?

892
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,293
Tony:
Takin' care of some business.
It's nothin'.

893
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,714
Hi.

894
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,427
Susie, why don't you take
your drink over there?

895
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,221
My father and I need to talk
for a few minutes.

896
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:47,307
Oh, okay.

897
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,229
- I like your shirt.
- Hello, sunshine.

898
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,314
Hi.

899
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,153
How's business?

900
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,532
- Business is good as always.
- Yeah.

901
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,703
- We'll see.
- God, I am so sick of this
bimbo shit.

902
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,538
I could really go
for a smoke right now.

903
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,166
- You don't happen to have
a cigar on you, do you?
- Fresh out.

904
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,920
- What the fuck is that
in your hand?
- Therapy.

905
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,176
Ed:
I don't know.
This professor doesn't fit in

906
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,052
with the other
Soldier Hill boys.

907
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,639
- Shit, this Twinkie's good.
- Karl: You may be right.

908
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,308
Let's see what he has
to say about it.

909
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,229
( liquids bubbling )

910
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,399
Professor McMurdo, Wayne.

911
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,234
We're not here to hurt you.
We're here to help.

912
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,155
You've been making steroids
for the Soldier Hill boys,
haven't you?

913
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,450
Did you see
what they did?

914
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:50,287
Did you see
what they did to that man?

915
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,164
- Ed: What man?
- Kirby.

916
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,336
They kicked him,
they beat him.

917
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,214
- They killed him.
- Ed: Why?

918
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,509
- Why would they kill him?
- For nothing!

919
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,469
Because he wanted money.
He wanted more money

920
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,471
for the supplies
he provides to me.

921
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,725
They said that
if I stepped out of line,

922
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,061
- they would kill my family.
- All right. Calm down,
calm down.

923
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,771
We'll protect you
and your family, Wayne.

924
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,566
I'm stuck.

925
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:23,278
I'm stuck.
( whimpering )

926
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,197
- I'm just stuck.
- You're not stuck, okay?

927
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,699
Listen to me.

928
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,242
You help us
and nothing's
going to happen

929
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,161
to you or your family.
I promise you that, okay?

930
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,246
Wayne:
Who are you
to promise that?

931
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,916
- We're the guys that are going
to kick their ass.
- He's right.

932
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,469
I'll see you tomorrow.

933
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,971
- You sure?
- Yeah, I promise.

934
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,849
Bye-bye. So long.

935
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,146
See what I mean, Vince?
We're barely running
in the black.

936
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,273
- This here.
- What?

937
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:04,402
What's this?
This huge charge
for office expenses.

938
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:08,198
Vince, every business
has office expenses.

939
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,158
( laughing )

940
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,202
Jerry, you don't have
an office.

941
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,788
- Jerry: Still, Vince...
- Uh, uh, uh, uh.

942
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:19,209
Jerry, after what I did
for you...

943
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,504
I mean, you were
knocking down old ladies
in the street

944
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,132
and stealing their
social security checks

945
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,009
when I took you in.

946
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,470
Come on, Jerry.

947
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:34,432
You gotta watch it when you
cook the books, Jerry.

948
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:37,435
See-- because sometimes...

949
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,147
- ( sizzling )
- ( screaming )

950
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:57,288
Because sometimes
you end up getting
yourself cooked.

951
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,209
You do that to me again

952
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,379
and I'll fucking roast
you alive.

953
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,176
You understand me, Jerry?

954
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:14,180
- You understand me, Jerry?!
- Yes, sir.

955
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,267
Get the fuck
out of here.

956
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,569
What the fuck
are you looking at?

957
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,031
Nicole:
Well, if these guys are doing
what you think they're doing,

958
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:35,869
- why don't you
just call the police?
- I will when it's time.

959
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,622
You know, the right way
to do things isn't always
the lawful way.

960
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,250
Yeah, but making up your own
morality as you go along

961
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,210
is somewhat dangerous,
wouldn't you say?

962
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:47,172
So are you saying
that helping you is
the wrong thing to do?

963
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:50,508
What are you saying--
my father was doing
the right thing

964
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,845
when he abandoned
his family and ran off
to go play soldier?

965
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,475
Listen to me, Nicole.

966
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,977
There's a lot of things
I can't tell you,

967
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,354
but I can tell you this.

968
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,356
Your father was a patriot

969
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,693
and he fought and died
for his country.

970
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:12,864
I wrote to him
just before he left
on this last mission.

971
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,576
And I asked him not to go.

972
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,913
I actually got him a job
on the campus police force.

973
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,207
I thought it would pay him
the same amount of money

974
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,375
and he could be here
with me.

975
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:31,132
I never heard back from him.

976
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,551
Do you ever think about that?
Is that going to happen to you?

977
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,596
Are you gonna end up
thousands of miles
away somewhere,

978
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,350
all by yourself
dying in some country
that nobody's even heard of?

979
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,185
Maybe...

980
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:46,022
but then again
I could get hit by a bus
on the way to class today.

981
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,400
- We all got to go sometime.
- Nurse: We got to go.

982
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,710
Well, Tony Lo--
right on time.

983
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:14,300
Hey, guy. Could have used you
in the secondary last Saturday.

984
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,095
Yeah, with or without
my piece?

985
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,722
Hey, I never had a cornerback
that tackled like you did.

986
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,683
Yeah, well,

987
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,977
you never had one with knees
as bad as mine either.

988
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,022
It was the only thing
that kept you from
being the best.

989
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,651
Listen, thanks for the help
with Stewart,

990
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:35,446
and, eh, I might need
your help again.

991
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,907
Her substitute's just
as much trouble
as she was.

992
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,784
Yeah?

993
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,161
What is it with these
English professors?

994
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,830
( engine starts )

995
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,877
( grunting )

996
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,826
Professor.

997
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,412
Payday, my man.
You got the stuff?

998
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,041
- Professor?
- You got the shit or what?

999
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:36,716
All you had to do was say,
"I got it right here, Frankie."

1000
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,888
What the hell is this?

1001
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,979
( electricity buzzing )

1002
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,808
You know, you did
a great job, Wayne.

1003
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:30,228
And they totally convinced
you were scared senseless.

1004
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,855
Because I was.

1005
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,899
What did you do to them?

1006
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,528
- It was a kickin' chicken.
- A what?

1007
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,238
Wayne's worried
about the boys.

1008
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,615
Oh, they've just been hit
with an electrical charge.

1009
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,618
It's nothing lethal,
unfortunately.

1010
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,955
- How much is in here?
- 80.

1011
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,249
It should be $80,000.

1012
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,584
Some for me,
some for raw materials.

1013
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,919
- Huh.
- Keep it.

1014
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:58,798
Payment for giving me
my life back.

1015
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,843
Wayne, I think it's time for you
to take a little sabbatical.

1016
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,720
I want you to take
your family, too.

1017
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,430
Until we get this
all sorted out.

1018
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,889
- Hut.
- ( grunting )

1019
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,601
( whistle blows )

1020
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,771
Coach Braden.

1021
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,940
Can I help you?

1022
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,193
Josh Silver is dead.

1023
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,069
What are you
talking about?

1024
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,655
He was using Anatest.

1025
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,574
It's a veterinary steroid.

1026
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,408
It's used on race-horses.

1027
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:11,287
He took a dose
that was meant for about
three tons of horse-flesh.

1028
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,541
Yeah, well,
I'm not surprised.

1029
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,711
He never did have his head
screwed on straight.

1030
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:19,587
Listen to me.

1031
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,965
I know that Tony Lo Russo
is supplying your team
with steroids,

1032
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:26,803
I know you're in on it,
and I have video tape
to prove it.

1033
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:27,428
Look,

1034
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,931
I don't know where Josh
got what he was taking,

1035
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,351
- but it wasn't from
anybody on this team.
- It's over, Braden.

1036
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,613
You know, for years
I ran a clean program.

1037
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,198
Probably the only one
in the conference,

1038
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,575
and you know what?
We always lost.

1039
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,869
And then after last season,
there was talk of firing me

1040
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,373
and my coaching staff
and phasing out the whole
football program.

1041
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:58,167
My career
would have been finished.

1042
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,711
Your career is finished.

1043
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,381
You'll be lucky
if you don't do time.

1044
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:13,099
- ( chatter )
- ( door opens )

1045
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,567
It's a mol-- a molecule.

1046
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,285
Man: Damn.

1047
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,541
Steroids.

1048
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,918
They pump you up.

1049
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,130
They make you huge.

1050
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:48,009
Make you feel
like you're the master
of the universe.

1051
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,219
While you're mastering
the universe, let me
tell you about

1052
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,180
a couple of others things
that they can do.

1053
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,892
They can give you
high blood pressure,

1054
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:59,437
they can give you
coronary disease,

1055
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:01,272
- kidney disease...
- ( chuckles )

1056
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,274
...cancer of the liver,

1057
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:06,360
they can cause impotence
and sterility.

1058
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:11,282
Not to mention
diarrhea, acne,

1059
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:17,163
hair loss, body odor,

1060
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:20,917
yellowing of the eyes,

1061
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:25,296
and the always popular
withered testicles.

1062
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,757
- ( gasps )
- ( groans )

1063
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,884
- Bo: Withered testicles.
- Karl: Having trouble getting
a date on Saturday?

1064
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,761
Just wait till she finds out
what you're packing

1065
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,389
in your shorts
when you're doing steroids.
Absolutely nothing.

1066
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:40,937
Oh, hey, and I almost forgot.

1067
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:44,273
One other minor side effect.
It can kill you.

1068
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,945
Not years from now
down the road, but right now.

1069
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:52,657
Today. This minute.

1070
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:55,868
But, hey,
don't take my word for it.

1071
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,537
Just ask your classmate
Josh Silver,

1072
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:01,165
but don't expect an answer
anytime soon...

1073
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,834
because right now
he's on a stainless steel
autopsy table

1074
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,711
down at the medical
examiner's office

1075
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,047
having his organs
removed and dissected

1076
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,467
one by one.

1077
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,887
But, hey, he sure could
bench-press, couldn't he?

1078
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:18,975
Josh, man.

1079
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,857
- Tony: Well, is he
gonna come or what?
- Braden: He's coming.

1080
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:29,193
I left a note
on his windshield.

1081
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,570
Told him we had a meeting
with the athletic director

1082
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,781
and we wanted him
to be there.

1083
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,378
How you doing?
You must be Tony.

1084
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,047
That's Tony Lo.

1085
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:53,509
I've heard you've been
spreading nasty rumors
about me.

1086
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,845
Said I'm some sort of...

1087
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:58,347
steroid drug pusher.

1088
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,147
I guess it keeps you busy
when you're not killing people.

1089
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:10,693
- I never killed anybody.
- No?

1090
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,111
Oh, I see. So you're
just here

1091
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,864
- to rough me up
a little, huh?
- Nah.

1092
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,699
We just want you
to help us conjugate

1093
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,325
some verbs,
Professor.

1094
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,714
Tony:
Come on.

1095
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,027
( blade clicks )

1096
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:04,997
( clangs )

1097
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,381
( coughs )

1098
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,216
Now you got two choices.

1099
01:08:57,258 --> 01:09:00,886
You can take your boys
out of here or you can die.

1100
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,347
Don't kill me.
Just don't kill me.

1101
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,641
That's a good choice.

1102
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:14,024
Hey, look.

1103
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,865
Let's go.

1104
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,377
Who did this to my son?

1105
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,882
It was that professor
at the college.

1106
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:41,093
Braden wanted us to shake
him down to find out what
he was after, but...

1107
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,682
it didn't turn out
that way.

1108
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,895
I want his body.

1109
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:53,230
Where did you put it?

1110
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,566
We-- he's not--

1111
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,866
he's still alive,
Mr. Lo Russo.

1112
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,535
You bring me my son
in the trunk of a car

1113
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,958
and you tell me the person
who did it walked away?

1114
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,922
Look at him.
He was my son.

1115
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,636
Look at him.
( yells )

1116
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,599
- You punk!
You stinking bum!
- Thug: Vince! Vince!

1117
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,310
Vince! You got Tony
to take care of.

1118
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,437
- He deserves some respect.
- ( groaning )

1119
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,984
You punk!

1120
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:44,657
- Punk!
- I know-- I know
where to find him.

1121
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,367
The professor.

1122
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,914
He rides around
in this white van.

1123
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,832
It's a piece of junk.
You can't miss it.

1124
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:56,627
It's usually out
by the college.

1125
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,052
- ( crying )
- Shh.

1126
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,351
( gunshot )

1127
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,902
Like that, Salerno.

1128
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,737
That's how
I want it done.

1129
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,491
Just like that.

1130
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:45,342
What the hell?!
Throw the ball!

1131
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:48,178
Where's Joe Namath
when you need him?
( spits )

1132
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,603
Hey, Rahmel.

1133
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,857
If I have to watch
any more of this game,
I'm going to have to puke.

1134
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,778
- Nice shirt.
- ( machine beeping )

1135
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,989
Whom do I have the pleasure
of meeting? Hmm?

1136
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,074
Your maker.

1137
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,758
Here we go.

1138
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,847
- There you are.
- Thanks.

1139
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,059
Thank you.

1140
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,853
So I got you this.

1141
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,314
I thought you might be
getting bored sitting
around all day.

1142
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,858
Oh.

1143
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:47,863
( chuckles )
"War and Peace."

1144
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,032
Well, it's just
the right-sized book

1145
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,492
if you have a lot
of time on your hands.

1146
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,702
Oh, yeah.
Have you ever read it?

1147
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,788
Only in Russian.

1148
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:00,084
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1149
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,461
So...

1150
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:05,881
what you are up to now
with all these gangster guys,

1151
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:08,675
it's not really about me
anymore, is it?

1152
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,677
No, not entirely.

1153
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,640
- So what do you hope
to gain by this?
- The usual.

1154
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:18,018
Truth. Justice.

1155
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,604
The American way.

1156
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,942
( loud beeping )

1157
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,950
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

1158
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,953
I have to go.

1159
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,424
( machine beeping )

1160
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,886
- What happened?
- He recorded it.

1161
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,638
- Whom do I have the pleasure
of meeting?
- Your maker.

1162
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,515
- Karl: Who did it?
- Andy: One of Lo Russo's guys.

1163
01:13:56,557 --> 01:14:00,227
- What about the warehouse?
- I know a way we can get in.

1164
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,229
Karl: I think we've shown
a remarkable amount
of restraint,

1165
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,481
but the time
for diplomacy is over.

1166
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,906
- ( intercom beeps )
- Hello?

1167
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:17,327
- Man: Yeah?
- Hi, um, this is Susie Hammer
from the bar.

1168
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:21,123
- What the hell do you want?
- I have a date with Tony.

1169
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,167
Tony's not here.

1170
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:26,211
Well, then I guess
I have a date with you.

1171
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:46,231
Andy:
Yoo-hoo. Hello?

1172
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,821
- Hi.
- So I guess you didn't hear,
your boyfriend's dead.

1173
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:55,991
Tony passed?

1174
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,619
Yeah, Tony passed.

1175
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,955
Since he passed,
I figured you might like
to express your sorrow

1176
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:05,125
by giving head to one
of his business associates.

1177
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,044
( both laugh )

1178
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,798
So you can start
by taking that top down

1179
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,843
'cause I like your tits.

1180
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:20,724
Well, it might
make me feel better,
but who else is here?

1181
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,435
I mean, I wouldn't want
someone walking in on us.

1182
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,146
No, they're all
out back someplace...

1183
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,857
- amusing themselves.
- Yeah, how many of them?

1184
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,945
See, because
what I'm thinking is,
instead of giving you head,

1185
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,321
I could just give you
a nice little...

1186
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,156
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

1187
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:44,498
Oh!

1188
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,835
( saw whirrs )

1189
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:52,965
Plenty of room for junior.

1190
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:57,219
- ( grunting )
- ( screams )

1191
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:07,980
Karl:
Okay. I got picture.

1192
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:10,023
- ( grunting )
- ( screams )

1193
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:19,783
- This little piggy
didn't deserve to live.
- ( bone cracks )

1194
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,579
- This little piggy offended me
with his dirty nails.
- ( bone cracks )

1195
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,039
This little piggy won't be
sticking itself into any more
female little piggies.

1196
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:26,957
- ( bone cracks )
- ( screaming )

1197
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:30,085
- This little piggy moaned
as I killed it.
- ( bone cracks )

1198
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:30,836
- ( screams )
- ( grunts )

1199
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,922
And this little piggy chose
suicide over being alone.

1200
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,924
- ( bone cracks )
- ( screams )

1201
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:38,844
( bone cracks )

1202
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,937
( knocks on door )

1203
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,523
( moaning )

1204
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:04,119
These tits...
I bought them for $49.95

1205
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,912
at the Pleasure Factory
down on Ocean Street.

1206
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,794
Ones with nipples cost more.

1207
01:17:15,839 --> 01:17:19,843
( grunts )
Don't get up on my account.

1208
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,941
- Lookin' good.
- Lo Russo's here for sure.

1209
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,986
- Where?
- In the back.

1210
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:40,405
Karl:
These trucks are going
to give us some good cover.

1211
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:42,240
Pretty deserted in there.
Let's take them down quick.

1212
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:45,494
It looks like--
what the hell is that?

1213
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,918
I don't know,
but I never get that
on my cable station.

1214
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,337
All right. We're going to
have to get those girls out
of here as soon as we can.

1215
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,923
- That's the first thing up.
- All right.

1216
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:01,760
- We got a sex party inside.
- Oh, Jesus.

1217
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:06,431
- Damn. All right.
- Andy: You guys ready?

1218
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:09,893
- I came here to play.
- Karl: In you go, girl.

1219
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,884
Man:
I think I heard something.
Check it out, Jimmy.

1220
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,932
( screams )

1221
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,149
Ah!

1222
01:18:58,942 --> 01:19:01,319
( moaning )

1223
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,780
Man:
Come here. Oh, baby.

1224
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,490
Hey, asshole.

1225
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:08,034
Huh?

1226
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,953
- ( grunts )
- ( gasps )

1227
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,044
Come on, girls. Party's over.
Come on, let's move it!

1228
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:31,558
( katana slicing )

1229
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:35,896
( whimpering )

1230
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,257
( screams )

1231
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,748
( screaming )

1232
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:40,961
( screaming )

1233
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,968
( bone cracks )

1234
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:20,250
- Mel, I'm hit.
- Ladies, I want you
to do yourselves a favor.

1235
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,502
When you get home,
I want you to see
a good doctor.

1236
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,296
You got it?

1237
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:27,507
- ( groans )
- Say goodbye, asshole.

1238
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,970
- ( katana slices )
- ( screaming )

1239
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,853
- Hey, guys,
Lo Russo's getting away.
- ( tires squealing )

1240
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,444
Don't worry, boss.
The car's bulletproof.

1241
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,529
I'll get us out of here.

1242
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:07,380
- What the hell was that?
- That son of a bitch
is on the roof.

1243
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,260
I'll get him off.
Don't worry.

1244
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:20,435
( tires squealing )

1245
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,358
( blade zings )

1246
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,236
Salerno!

1247
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:34,950
( tires squealing )

1248
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,579
Damn it!

1249
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,004
- ( groaning )
- Vince: Son of a bitch.

1250
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:51,841
- Motherfucker.
- ( engine starts )

1251
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,023
( groans )

1252
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:23,999
( yells, groans )

1253
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,045
Come on! Come on,
you son of a bitch!

1254
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:32,132
I'll kill you, you fuck!

1255
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,190
Oh, you fuck!

1256
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:51,151
( tires squealing )

1257
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:55,822
( yells )

1258
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,962
Fuck you!
( yells )

1259
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:43,369
How's that shoulder?

1260
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,581
- Ah!
- I've seen worse.

1261
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:49,667
Easy for you to say.
It's not your shoulder.

1262
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,424
Hey, did anybody
ever tell you

1263
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:59,803
that these things
are bad for your health?

1264
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,003
( children chattering )

1265
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:57,485
Hey.

1266
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,871
- Hey.
- Karl: Hey.

1267
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:09,497
Nicole:
You got here just in time.

1268
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,249
They're just about ready
to release me.

1269
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:14,544
- What happened to you?
- Oh, this?

1270
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,337
I cut myself shaving.

1271
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:18,798
- Oh, shaving
your arms again, huh?
- Oh, just down the elbow.

1272
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,758
( laughing )

1273
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,635
This is Andy and Rahmel.

1274
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,053
When you're in trouble,
two of the best people

1275
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:26,014
to have on your side,
and you did.

1276
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,475
- Well, thank you very much.
- Anytime.

1277
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:31,060
You're welcome.

1278
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:34,814
- I got something for you.
- Oh, thank you.

1279
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:41,321
Oh, Hemingway.
"Farewell to Arms."

1280
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,740
In Russian.
I'm impressed.

1281
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:45,909
Rahmel:
Karl, we should get going.

1282
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:52,123
Another mission, huh?

1283
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,876
- Well...
- Good luck.

1284
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,173
Oh, hey, Karl.

1285
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,426
- I'll take it
if you still have it.
- What?

1286
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,679
My father's medal.

1287
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:19,943
Reporter:
Violence flares
in the Horn of Africa

1288
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:23,404
as Ethiopian jets bomb Eritrea
for the second straight day.

1289
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:26,407
More fallout
from the Eastern Atlantic
football scandal

1290
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:29,869
as lineman Bo Robinson
leaves the team and school.

1291
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,665
This on the heels
of the recent suicide of
football coach Bill Braden.

1292
01:27:33,706 --> 01:27:37,752
Weatherman Winston Williams
says we can look forward
to five straight days...
