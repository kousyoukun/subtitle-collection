3
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,290
Okay, let me ask you something.

4
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,500
?Qué pasa? Huh? ?Qué pasa, eh?

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,750
Now, who's gonna win the money?

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,660
Show me!

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,700
It's time for fun right now.

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,410
Who's gonna bingo?

9
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,580
Okay, let's get started right now.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,290
Here's the first ball.

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,330
And it's gonna be I-17, the dancing queen.

12
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,870
How many dancing queens do we have out there tonight?

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,200
All right.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,620
This is gonna be G-58,

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,040
make them wait.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,830
? See-line woman ?

18
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,830
? She drink coffee ?

19
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,160
? She drink tea ?

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,830
? Then she go home ?

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,580
? See-line woman ?

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,120
? Dressed in green ?

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,410
? Wears silk stockings with golden seams ?

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,120
? See-line woman ?

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,790
? See-line woman ?

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,580
? Dressed in red ?

27
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,540
? Make a man lose his head...

28
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,250
This is gonna be B-4, 

29
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,580
knock at the door.

30
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,410
B-4
B-4,

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,200
knock at the door.

32
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,790
On location.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,410
Eyes on.

34
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,790
Eyes on.

35
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,200
Headed towards the alley.

38
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,330
She there?

39
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,160
Oh, yeah, she's here.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,700
And King's still inside?

41
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,750
He sure is, like a little lamb.

42
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,000
I want the decks cleared, Cobb, both of them. Understood?

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,700
Gonna watch, wait, and I'll report back, Burke.

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,910
? See-line woman ?

46
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,410
It's gonna be G-56,

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,040
was she worth it?

48
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,540
G-56
G-56, 

49
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,080
was she worth it?

50
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,200
N-41
? See-line woman ?

57
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,500
Oh, oh, there. They've got lots of 'em over there.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,660
N-41
N-41.

60
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,500
N-41 stands for "time for fun."

61
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,580
N-41.

63
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,200
Hello, Ray King.

64
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Ana?s.

65
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,200
Please, have a seat.

69
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,700
You have a job for me?

70
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,250
Yeah.

71
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,660
Here, let me, uh...

72
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,910
This is...

73
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,910
...Gino and Edith Sanchez, 

74
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,500
their son Alberto.

75
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,950
They left El Salvador to come to the U.S.

76
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,790
Alberto would be 13 now.

77
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,660
He's... he's five there.

78
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't kill children.

79
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,830
Don't what?

80
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,330
Turn your hearing aid up.

81
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,830
I do adults.

82
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,540
- I don't kill children. - Yeah, no, no, no.

83
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,000
They disappeared.

84
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,660
I was hired to find them.

85
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,660
By her father.

86
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,000
Number 51...

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,950
I just...

88
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,950
I need you to help me.

89
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,790
I mean, you're really the only person who can.

90
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,750
You see, I'm semiretired now,

91
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,160
and I'm only taking cases that mean something to me.

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,080
What do you want, King?

93
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,160
Ana?s...

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
...do you know what acquired savant syndrome is?

95
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,200
No.

96
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,750
But I know there are men outside,

97
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,540
the kind that sleep at airport gates in Africa and the Middle East.

98
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,620
They didn't follow me.

99
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,120
Okay, they're gonna come after me.

100
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,580
When they do, get out of here.

101
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,200
? See-line woman dressed in red ?

102
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,200
? Make a man lose his head ?

103
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,000
? See-line woman...

104
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,790
Fuck.

105
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,540
? See-line woman ?

106
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,080
? Oh, no, no, no ?

107
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,080
? Oh, no, no, no ?

108
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,250
? Oh... ?

109
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,080
? Oh... ?

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,790
? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,120
? See-line, see-line ?

112
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
? See-line ?

113
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,290
? See-line, see-line ?

114
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,540
? See-line, see-line ?

115
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,620
? See-line...

116
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,450
Fuck me.

117
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,410
? She drink coffee ?

118
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,830
? She drink tea ?

119
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,580
? Then she go home ?

120
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,290
? See-line woman, see-line woman ?

121
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,830
? Dressed in green...

122
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,250
? Wears silk stockings with golden seams ?

123
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,580
? See-line woman, see-line woman ?

124
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,200
? Dressed in red ?

125
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,660
? Make this man lose his head ?

126
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,660
? Lose his head, lose his head ?

127
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,660
? Lose his head, lose his head ?

128
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,910
? See-line woman, see-line woman ?

129
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,370
Fuck.

130
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,040
? See-line woman ?

131
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,410
? Dressed in red ?

132
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,620
? Make a man lose his head ?

133
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,790
? See-line woman ?

134
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,250
? Dressed in green ?

135
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,580
? Wears silk stockings...

136
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,120
? See-line woman ?

139
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,500
Deputy Director Medina's office.

141
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,330
Director Medina, I have the LAPD on the phone for you.

142
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,790
Okay. Uh, chairs?

143
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,330
Yeah, two Herman Millers and a Steelcase.

144
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:29,910
Thanks.

146
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,580
This is Marybeth Medina.

147
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,080
Yeah.

148
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,500
Wait, what? Repeat that.

149
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,080
Describe him, please.

150
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,580
No. 

151
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,540
I understand.

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
He didn't share what he was working on with you?

154
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,250
No. 

155
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,950
Uh, I knew he put up a P.I. shingle,

156
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,790
but we fell out of touch.

157
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,700
So no money problems that you're aware of?

158
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,120
No.

159
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,160
Here, come this way.

160
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,290
Raymond King.

161
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,660
He was deputy director of FinCEN.

162
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,750
My boss.

163
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,290
You said they didn't find anything on him, no wallet?

164
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,830
Well, he might have.

165
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,790
But it took us a little while to get there.

166
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,700
Things have a tendency of disappearing.

167
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,790
Well, how'd you know to call me?

168
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,830
His cell phone.

169
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,580
You were his "in case of emergency" contact.

170
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,080
Well, why'd you ask if he was having money problems?

172
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,040
What's the difference between

173
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,950
dressy casual and business casual?

174
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,290
Both mean leave your cargo shorts

175
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,250
and flip-flops at home.

176
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,750
I don't own cargo shorts, and I don't own flip-flops.

177
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,660
Could we discuss business now,

178
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,500
or do you need more first-date tips?

179
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,410
Go.

180
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,200
The Inagawa-kai want you to audit a bank before 

181
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,700
they assume control.

182
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,450
Thoughts?

183
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,700
You're very conspicuous in Tokyo.

184
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,500
But?

185
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,830
The yakuza always pay on time.

186
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,660
Next.

187
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,660
Se?or Obregon wants to know 

188
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,250
if we want payment in cash or artwork.

189
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,200
What art does he have?

190
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,200
A Rivera he says you admired.

192
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,410
How much does he owe?

193
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,950
2.4 million.

194
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,790
The Rivera, of course.

195
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,830
Heavy sigh.

196
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,500
What's the remainder of the receivables?

197
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,410
1.35 million.

198
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,120
Layer the rest in the New Zealand accounts and in France,

199
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,040
and the remainder in Harbor's endowment.

200
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Under what name? Gauss, Babbage or Carroll?

201
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,040
Nash. Anything else?

202
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,910
Don't wear your black suit.

203
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,950
It makes you look like a mortician.

205
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,080
Well, welcome to the 13th annual

206
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,410
Boise Romance Festival.

207
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,040
Whoa.

209
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,950
You all are here for one reason:

210
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,410
to make a connection, meet that special someone

212
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,660
and find love.

213
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,700
Oh, P.S. 

215
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,250
Don't forget to pick up your free Romance Festival T-shirt. 

217
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,080
- A $25 value there. - Yeah.

219
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,750
So, since most of you are first-timers,

220
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,450
let's recap how this works.

221
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,410
You answered a battery of questions

222
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,660
designed to express your wants, needs, 

223
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,250
hopes and desires.

224
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,790
We then used our proprietary mathematical algorithm

225
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,620
to search for your ten best fits.

226
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,080
That same algorithm

227
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,870
in 12 previous festivals has resulted in...

228
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,790
53 marriages!

229
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,080
All right, give it up for that.

230
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,540
Hell yeah.

231
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
Uh, now, no names were sent to you.

232
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,250
Only the I.D. numbers and photos

233
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,620
ranked in order of connectivity.

234
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,410
No early online searches allowed.

235
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,040
You'll each spend five minutes per date,

236
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,500
then unlimited time later in the day.

237
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,370
Oh, ladies, 

238
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,870
it's-it's not a competition.

239
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,120
No, there's plenty of time to get to your first date last.

240
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,330
Hold your horses.

241
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,290
Um, o-okay.

242
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,330
Go ahead, go on. Go meet that special someone.

243
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,500
- Godspeed. Nondenominational. - Yes.

244
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,200
- Hi. - Hello.

245
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,580
Um, I'm Ann Renee.

246
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,000
And I just love, love, love accountants.

247
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,910
- Well, that's a coincidence. - Yeah.

248
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,000
Um, do you believe in love at first sight,

249
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,410
that there's someone we're meant to be with,

250
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,370
a soulmate?

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
Well, no, that's a... absurd, childish notion.

252
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,830
Of-of course that's not real.

253
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,790
What do you mean, you reverse-engineered our algorithm?

254
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,620
I data-mined the top online dating apps

255
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
and mapped a battery of your questions against theirs.

257
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,500
And?

258
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,080
I built my own dating algorithm.

259
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,950
Well, the question of whether or not

260
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,500
there's such a thing as love or it's simply an electrical,

261
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,290
- neurochemical process that takes place in the brain is up 

262
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,750
for debate.

263
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,370
Uh, have a good day.

264
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,040
I scraped the data clusters for

265
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,410
the likeliest date-producing words.

266
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,330
Wait. "Date-producing words"?

267
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,160
Yes.

268
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,450
For example, women claim to value commitment and stability,

269
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,410
but they swipe for dangerous and exciting.

270
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,200
Sexy bad boys.

271
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,620
Hi.

272
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,370
How are you?

273
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,120
Um, I'm doing really well.

274
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,000
- Lori. - Yeah, Lori.

275
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,250
Is that a nickname or short for anything?

276
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,950
No, it's just Lori.

277
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,370
I assigned numerical values to your questions by tokenizing them 

278
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,200
in an embedding matrix

279
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,790
and generating a predictive model 

280
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,250
for the most effective answers,

281
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,910
which I provided 

282
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,120
without lying.

283
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,250
My last boyfriend 

284
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,910
spent every weekend golfing with his friends.

285
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,910
Do you spend a lot of time with friends?

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,950
No, not at all. No.

287
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,790
I have no friends.

288
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,580
No friends.

289
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,000
Um, 

290
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,450
pets?

291
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,660
I identified misleading profile photos

292
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,580
as the top complaint across all dating apps.

293
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,660
Women lie about weight and age.

294
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,250
Men lie about height and age.

295
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,500
So I adjusted my photo and smile accordingly.

296
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,830
Oh, my God.

297
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,540
I like camping.

298
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,790
- A lot. - So do I.

299
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,290
Yeah, I thought I saw an Airstream in one of your photos?

300
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,660
Yes, that's my home.

301
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,330
That's where I live.

302
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,450
Oh, permanently?

303
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,040
Well, as long as I'm alive.

304
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,830
None of us are living anywhere permanently.

305
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,080
- Okay. - This is just a husk.

306
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,120
- Okay. Oh. - Eventually, this body will be a corpse.

307
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,660
And the best part is 

308
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,870
you don't have to amend your tax return

309
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,500
for unclaimed depreciation,

310
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,870
which I'm sure you know is very meaningful.

311
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,750
Not only does it have that unintended benefit,

312
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,910
but the best part is 

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,160
that you don't have to amend your tax return

314
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,620
for unclaimed depreciation.

315
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,000
And I will share this with you even though it's a...

316
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,200
well, it's a bit of a trade secret,

317
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,790
albeit not a proprietary one, but the best part is that

318
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,160
you don't have to amend your tax return 

319
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,660
for unclaimed depreciation.

320
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,120
Yeah, um, 

321
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,790
how about something else?

322
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,000
Um, kids?

323
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,120
You're... 44?

324
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,750
Um, 45.

325
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,080
Well, I suppose anything's possible.

326
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,580
Ugh. God.

327
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,040
I just mean mathematically.

328
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,160
You gamed the system?

329
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,330
I optimized my profile.

330
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,370
Whole wall covered top to bottom.

331
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,000
Damnedest thing you ever saw.

332
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,540
Maps, Post-it Notes, sicko photos.

333
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,040
Like something 

334
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,580
out of one of those "let's catch us a pervert" shows.

335
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,410
Busy little bee, wasn't he?

336
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,000
Wh-What did you do with his stuff?

337
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,870
Oh, we didn't throw it away.

338
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,040
Couldn't rent it like that, all those nasty photos he had.

339
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,870
How long was he here?

340
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,120
Two months.

341
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,200
Next payment was due yesterday.

345
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,870
The rent-- how much?

347
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,330
Harbor Neuroscience Academy.

348
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,330
Yeah, this is, uh, Deputy Director Medina, U.S. 

349
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,870
Treasury Department.

350
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,000
Is there a Christian Wolff on staff?

351
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,450
I'm sorry, ma'am. No.

352
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,330
Okay.

353
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,790
Um, how about a Carl Gauss?

354
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,040
Or-or Charles Babbage?

355
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,160
Lewis Carroll? Lou, maybe?

356
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,660
This is Harbor Neuroscience Academy.

357
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,700
Yeah, I'm-I'm aware of that. Uh...

358
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,750
do you have any employees, 

359
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,870
maybe female, British accent?

360
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,450
What's this in reference to?

361
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,040
About a former student whose father was in the military?

362
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,870
The student records are sealed.

363
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,410
Uh, I'm the after-hours receptionist.

364
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,160
You should probably call back tomorrow

365
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,660
when there's someone here who can answer that for you.

366
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,910
I need to talk to the handler of The Accountant.

367
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,330
I know she's listening,

368
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,450
and I know he listens to her.

369
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
Excuse me?

370
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,250
My name is Marybeth Medina.

371
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,250
I'm staring at a pile of homicide photos,

372
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,410
maps of Central America,

373
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,370
Mexico, pizza receipts, and...

374
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,160
I'm pretty sure I'm staring at a photo of her boss.

375
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,700
I need his help.

377
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,540
Hanging up now.

378
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,580
W-Wait.

380
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,830
Ray King has been murdered.

382
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,830
Okay, let's see.

383
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,790
Ten, eight. Give you seven.

384
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,040
Ten, eight and seven? A pound?

385
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,080
Yeah, a pound.

386
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,120
It's sushi-grade tuna.

387
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Oh, come on. It's not sushi-grade.

388
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,700
Burke, it's sushi-grade.

389
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,410
It's bruised. There's no fat on it.

390
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,120
It's not sushi-grade at all. Come on.

391
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,450
Take it or leave it.

392
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,370
Dickie inside?

393
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,200
Dickie's inside.

394
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,200
He'll give you your money like last week and the week before, 

395
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,040
you fucker. Yeah, yeah. 

396
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,200
Tony, come on!

397
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,330
Sit down.

398
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,160
Okay, okay.

399
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Four pro hitters couldn't take out one woman.

400
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,950
How is that possible?

401
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,200
Technically, two hitters.

402
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,830
Two went after King. Two took her.

403
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,660
Three. Counting you.

404
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,330
I didn't have a clean shot.

405
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,330
You think she knows we were after her instead of King?

406
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,540
No chance.

407
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,450
How you figure?

408
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,000
We're aboveground.

409
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,330
Problem solved.

410
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,790
By your own logic, 

411
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,620
if she wanted to kill you, she would have.

412
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,620
Relax, boss.

413
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,370
She don't remember you.

414
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,290
Yet.

415
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,000
The fuck does that mean?

416
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,830
She showed up a couple of years ago.

417
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,580
The three men I was negotiating with had pissed 

418
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,410
off the wrong people.

419
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,200
So, let's talk about our success.

420
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,790
Your ships, 

421
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,290
my boats.

422
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,080
20 miles out to sea, hmm?

423
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,080
No Los Angeles port.

424
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,330
Just...

425
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,870
And she didn't recognize you?

426
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,790
No.

427
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,080
But one day she'll remember who I am and what I did,

428
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,370
and my whole world turns 

429
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,000
to shit.

430
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,370
You fly to Fort Worth tonight.

431
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,700
- No more Ray Kings. - Okay.

432
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,120
No more private investigators.

433
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,410
I don't want to get out of the shower one day

434
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,620
and find a human chain saw waiting for me.

435
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,200
Okay.

438
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,870
I coughed loudly twice.

439
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,790
No, please don't do that.

440
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,410
You're Christian Wolff.

441
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,910
You're Marybeth Medina.

442
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,000
Do I make you nervous?

443
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,950
You're an escaped convict, 

444
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,080
trained by a mob accountant.

445
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,250
Your clients are drug cartels,

446
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,700
money launderers, third-world warlords.

447
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,200
Is that a yes?

448
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,410
I saw a video of you killing men in Brooklyn.

449
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,330
I was in Chicago eight years ago.

450
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,410
With Ray.

451
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,290
Living Robotics. 

452
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,040
I saw all the dead bodies, heard the chanting.

453
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,080
"Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday."

454
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,790
What can I do for you, Ms. Medina?

455
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,500
Do you like puzzles, Mr. Wolff?

456
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,750
I don't know if this is one case or ten.

457
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,450
I do know Ray was nearly broke.

458
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,580
I found that photo 

459
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,330
in between the seat cushions

460
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,620
at the tavern Ray was at the night he was killed.

461
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,830
Three men were also shot to death inside the tavern,

462
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,750
one struck by a car outside.

463
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
All ex-Chilean special forces, 

464
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,700
Lautaro Brigade.

465
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,700
Was Ray capable of that?

466
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,500
No, he was not.

467
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,660
Dmitry Yoshenko.

468
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,080
Throat slit in a Moscow hotel.

469
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,080
Moshe Yeutz, car bomb, Jerusalem.

470
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,870
We haven't I.D.'d the rest.

471
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,830
Armando Reyes, Mexico City.

472
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,450
Ozan Unal, Istanbul.

473
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,830
Santino Sanvieri, Naples.

474
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,370
Must have been quite the fall.

475
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,790
The fall didn't kill him.

476
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,290
It was the abrupt stop.

477
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,700
It's a joke.

478
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,120
Why are you helping me?

479
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,660
Because you asked me.

483
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,370
Amen, amen, amen, amen.

484
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,580
Okay, so we've got

485
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,000
four dead mercs in the morgue,

486
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,080
homicides, 

487
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,450
tax returns,

488
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,120
map to Mexico, train schedule,

489
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,250
pizza, fish,

490
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,370
family photo

491
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,290
and a trashed Toyota.

492
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,910
So, how does this all connect?

493
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,910
What are you doing?

494
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,290
Waiting.

495
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,790
For?

496
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,160
Well, for you to finish.

497
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,790
Finish what?

498
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,040
I don't know.

499
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,330
Um, whatever it is that, um...

500
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,580
that you're in the process of doing.

501
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,370
So you can...?

502
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,410
Do what I need to do.

503
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,700
You might seek medical attention for the snoring problem.

504
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,700
Coffee?

505
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,000
I don't snore, so...

506
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,160
Nothing's where it was.

507
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,330
Well, your brain-- most brains--

508
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,120
when confronted with ambiguous visual data,

509
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,620
seek subconsciously to arrange it in a pattern that's familiar,

510
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,250
but that's not the pattern we're looking for here.

511
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,370
Right. Okay. 

512
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,700
What-what pattern are we looking for?

513
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,330
Survival probability.

514
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,750
They started...

515
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,620
...here, Central America.

516
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,160
Okay.

517
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,580
How do we know that?

518
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,410
His tattoo.

519
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,120
Barrio 18, Izalco Prison, El Salvador.

520
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,660
They're at war with MS-13.

521
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,290
When they reached the border of Mexico, they boarded this train.

522
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,200
Well, uh, no, that's a freight train, not a passenger train.

523
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,160
It's the Death Train.

524
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,250
Families ride on the roof, not in the cars.

525
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,500
It's the surest way to avoid immigration checkpoints.

526
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,910
When they arrived at Mexico City,

527
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,660
they would've typically headed to one of three areas

528
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,620
to cross into Texas and the United States:

529
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,200
El Paso, Del Rio, McAllen.

530
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,540
In this case, they crossed the Rio Grande into McAllen.

531
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,790
Why McAllen?

532
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,250
A gallon of water weighs eight pounds. A human being requires between one 

533
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,660
and a half and two gallons of water a day to survive in the desert.

534
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,330
So that's 36 to 48 pounds

535
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,540
a person not carrying a five-year-old has to carry.

536
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,000
Here's her son at five.

537
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,290
In this photograph, he looks to be about 13.

538
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,200
Edith arrived in Los Angeles and claimed work 

540
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,950
at Sudio's Pizza.

541
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,250
Uh, h-hold on. Um, Edith?

542
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,750
Edith Sanchez.

543
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,410
No, you can't possibly know 

544
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,160
that this woman in the photo

545
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,580
is the same Edith Sanchez on these 1040s.

546
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,660
Yes, it's a certainty.

547
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,250
She claimed one dependent, a child.

548
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,410
Of the three 1040s she filed, two had incomes

549
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,410
of roughly $15,000.

550
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,580
The third was $60,250.

551
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,790
That's twice as much in one year than the previous two combined.

552
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,290
Yes. That's not the strangest part.

553
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,830
She checked "married" but filed separately.

554
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,290
Had she filed jointly, she could've taken advantage

555
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,200
of the child and dependent care exemption.

556
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,080
Four times as much money in the third year,

557
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,410
checks "married," files separately, 

558
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,080
has a child and no child care.

559
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,660
A list of Ray's clients over the last 18 months shows six names, 

560
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,290
only one with a Latino surname:

561
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,870
Emiliano "Emi" Gonzalez, 

562
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,200
Fort Worth, Texas.

564
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,500
So, if 

565
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,290
Emi was Edith's father,

566
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,790
why didn't she call him for help?

567
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,040
I have no way of knowing that.

568
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,750
Do you have any influence at the IRS?

570
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,000
Keep an eye on the loading dock.

571
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,410
What's with the muscle?

572
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,000
You don't spend much time in Los Angeles, do you?

573
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,290
I'm not a fan of getting pistol-whipped and robbed.

574
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,700
No, I don't remember any Edith.

575
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,790
Sorry. Can't help you.

576
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,250
Jeanette, what do you got?

577
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,330
- Looks great. - Mm-hmm.

578
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,000
Why would an employee not take all 

579
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,790
the exemptions she's eligible for?

580
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,370
'Cause she's dumb?

581
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,290
'Cause she doesn't look like you?

582
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,120
Neither one.

583
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,910
Well, I don't see people as legal or illegal.

584
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,410
I see 'em as human beings, and I give 'em a chance.

585
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,790
Anything else?

586
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,450
No, sir. Thanks for your time.

587
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,620
You're welcome.

588
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,160
Two thirds of your business is takeout, correct?

589
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,910
Got my tax reports, huh?

590
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,500
You people.

591
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,370
That's right-- two thirds.

592
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,450
Ask me anything. Unit costs, payroll, promotions.

593
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,580
You name it, I know where every dime goes.

594
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,620
Last year's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

595
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,200
42.9 mil.

596
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,080
You claimed 41.9 million.

597
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,750
Keep reading, EF Hutton.

598
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,790
A million in charitable contributions to homeless shelters.

599
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,580
Let's go.

600
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,410
Setting aside the amateur nature of this preparation,

601
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,160
considering you could've deducted

602
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,450
considerably more from your taxable income,

603
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,580
what is the most frequently ordered size of pizza?

604
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,910
Large, 90%.

605
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,450
Large pizza is $17.35, 

606
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,750
which accounts for 1,484,315 large pizzas.

607
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,790
What's your point?

608
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,910
Your paper costs are $360,000,

609
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,120
which only accounts for 900,000 large pizza boxes.

610
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,370
You are making my head hurt.

611
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,700
It's considerably less than the aforementioned

612
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,950
1,484,315 large pizzas.

613
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,700
Right, that's because, uh, we do it by the slice.

614
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,660
- By the slice? No. - Yeah.

615
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,870
Impossible. You're fraudulently claiming more income than you're receiving

616
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,120
in order to conceal income from another source. What is it?

617
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,660
You fucking rodent.

618
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,620
Now, wait just a second.

619
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,750
I take time out of my busy day to answer your silly-ass questions,

620
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,290
and you got the balls to accuse me of money laundering?

621
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,580
Chris!

623
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,080
You're laundering money.

624
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,330
- Where is it coming from? - Let go of my arm!

625
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,950
Federal agent! Stay back. Everything's fine.

626
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,200
You're washing money. Tell me where it's coming from, 

627
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,500
or I will dislocate your shoulder. 

628
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,750
- Fuck off, you motherfucker. - It's quite painful.

629
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,000
Chris, that's enough!

630
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,330
I told you.

631
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,330
I don't traffic those girls!

632
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
No, I-I swear to God, I get a call.

633
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,160
I get a call, the cash comes in.

634
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,330
I know where they they use a motel or two.

635
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,700
- A suite. - Who is "them"?

636
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,620
I-I don't know. Ask one of the girls.

637
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,500
What motel?

638
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,870
- What motel? - City Center, Downtown.

639
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,750
Who's your contact?

640
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,580
Please, no.

641
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,450
Who's your contact?

642
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,000
Who's your contact?

643
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,370
Tomas!

644
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,000
We should go.

645
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,160
Were you dropped on your head as a child?

646
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,080
I feel that's not really your question.

647
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,700
You know, I work for a government agency.

648
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,370
I don't torture people.

649
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,830
You didn't.

650
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,410
I'm the deputy director of FinCEN, so I can't...

651
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,790
I know. I put you there.

652
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,620
You and Ray King.

653
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,200
You know, a British woman calls and gives me tips.

654
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,750
So criminals-- which is what you are--

655
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,040
give law enforcement-- that's me-- 

656
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,040
tips every day.

657
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,290
If by "tips" you mean names, dates, acts, 

658
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,950
account numbers, routing numbers,

659
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,250
yes, I give you tips.

660
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,410
You know, I'm not like you.

661
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,330
I can't just break the law when it suits me.

662
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,120
No more violence.

663
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,410
We need to take what he gave us and work our way up the chain.

664
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,950
That's how this is done.

665
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,830
Maybe the Bureau has an agent in this office they can spare.

666
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,330
I may know someone.

676
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,790
Hello.

678
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,500
Hi. 

679
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,040
Hi.

680
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,700
Hi.

681
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,080
Hello.

682
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,580
Hi. 

683
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,950
Hey, Margaret, it's...

684
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,750
Margaret...

685
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,410
Hey.

686
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,620
Fucking come on.

687
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,660
Hi, Margaret. It's Braxton.

688
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,910
Hello. Hi.

689
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,790
Hello, Margaret.

690
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,620
Fucking... fucking stop.

691
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,450
Okay. Hello.

692
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,540
Hello. 

693
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,040
Hello.

694
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,540
Margaret, it's Braxton. I was just...

695
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,950
God! Motherfucker.

696
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,450
Motherfucker! Just fucking do it.

697
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,620
Fucking do it.

698
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,580
You fucking do it.

699
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,120
You fucking pussy!

700
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,830
Hi. Hi. Hi, Margaret.

701
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,580
Hey, Margaret, it's-it's-it's...

702
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,580
Fuck, man, 

703
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,870
what are you so fucking scared of, man?

704
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,580
What are we even talking about here?

705
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,200
We're talking about two weeks.

706
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,000
That's 

707
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,450
14...

709
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,700
14 days, Margaret, in the life...

710
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,330
in a... in a... in a... in a...

711
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,410
in his... in his life.

712
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,700
Do you know what his name is?

713
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,370
It's Greg.

714
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,700
It's... it...

715
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,330
It's my Greg.

716
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,950
He is mine.

717
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
? Yeah...

718
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,700
Of course he's gonna sleep with me. Of course.

719
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,700
You want a bottle? I'll get a...

720
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,580
I'll give him a bottle. 

721
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,290
I'll... I'll give him a bottle.

722
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,120
A bottle. 

723
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,450
I-I can... I can... I can... I can con...

724
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,580
I can connect with-with...

725
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,750
Come on.

726
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,750
Margaret, it's Braxton.

728
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,790
Yeah. Me again. You, uh... You got me there, Margaret. 

729
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,950
Listen, I, uh...

730
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,910
You know, I was thinking about our last conversation,

731
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,370
and I have gone ahead and, uh, decided

732
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,540
that I'm going to swing on through and pick up the pup on Thursday.

733
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,250
Yeah, no, weaned at eight weeks.

734
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,540
No, you made that...

735
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,830
You made that abundantly clear, Margaret.

736
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,620
No, and I-I'm fully aware it's only been six,

737
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,700
but, you know, a corgi is an enormously smart dog, 

738
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,750
Margaret, and...

739
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,790
Fair enough. I just...

740
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,500
Not sure that I'm able to wrap my head 

741
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,620
around the logic of building a bond between 

742
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,910
a puppy and its mother

743
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,200
when it's literally never gonna see the mother again. Right?

744
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,620
I mean, why not take that precious two weeks

745
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,790
and build a bond between the owner and its pup

746
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,660
when they're gonna spend the rest of their lives together?

747
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,040
Well, no, but that's-that's-that's...

748
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,660
that's where the-the bottle-feeding component comes in.

751
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,330
Jesus.

752
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,750
All right. Yeah, you really...

753
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,950
You're yelling at me, Margaret. Yeah.

754
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,660
Okay.

756
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,040
Yeah, see... 

757
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,500
see you in two weeks.

758
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,160
Yep. Perfect.

759
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,120
Bye-bye.

760
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,250
Fuck you!

761
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,700
Fuck you, Margaret, you fucking bitch!

762
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,330
So tell me about you.

763
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,250
What do you... what do you do when you're not doing whatever it is you do?

764
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,660
You got any hobbies?

765
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:22,290
Like, um, I don't know, you bake or-or...

766
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,660
you fish?

767
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,160
No? 

768
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,620
You don't fish? No? 

769
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,950
You like to read? Maybe...

770
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,120
You garden?

771
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,500
Film.

772
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,120
Movies.

773
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,750
Uh, you got a favorite?

774
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,250
Zauberer von Oz.

775
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,200
Wizard of Oz.

776
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,450
Want to hear a little Oz fun fact?

777
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,790
The little dog, Toto, 

778
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,410
its real name was Terry. Terry the dog.

779
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,870
Terry the dog made 125 bucks a week on Oz.

780
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,700
You know what the little people made who played the Munchkins?

781
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,910
50 bucks.

782
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,580
I mean, is that a travesty of justice or what?

783
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,750
Sometimes I like to think about those little people, you know.

784
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,910
Put yourself in their shoes.

785
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,790
Bet they sat around with their little people friends, looking at Terry.

786
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,200
"Hey, this motherfucker, you know,

787
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,790
this guy's making twice as much as we are.

788
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,580
I don't remember Terry doing any song-and-dance numbers.

789
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,290
Do you?"

791
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,120
What do you want?

792
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,000
Braxton, hi. Hello. It's me, 

793
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,290
Chris, your brother.

794
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,250
I know it's you. 

795
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,620
You can't tell from the tone of my voice that I know it's you?

796
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,830
Oh, well, you sound hostile.

797
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,040
What do you want?

798
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,160
I need your help. 

799
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,830
Ah. Goodbye.

800
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,410
B-Braxton?

801
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,790
Fuck. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. You just...

802
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,330
Motherf...

803
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,080
Jesus Christ.

804
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,450
The fuck... All right.

805
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,660
Well, the last time that I did help you,

806
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,160
it nearly cost me my career. Are you aware of that?

807
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,830
You sound angry at me. Why?

808
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,500
Yes, you're goddamn right I'm angry.

809
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,910
I'm angry because, year after year, I call.

810
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
It's always me reaching out, and it's never you,

811
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,290
and now, just out of the blue, you call.

812
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,830
And why? Because what, you... you need my help?

813
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,790
How about... how about just calling?

814
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,080
How about just calling to shoot the shit?

815
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,790
"Hey, man, how you doing? How have you been?"

816
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,620
"Merry Christmas. Happy birthday, B." What about that one?

817
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,580
But it's not your birthday. Your birthday's November 11th.

818
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,200
Ah, you dum-dum, I know it's not my fucking birthday.

819
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,450
That's not the fucking point of what I'm...

820
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,580
What do you want?

821
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,950
Can you be in Los Angeles, California, in 24 hours?

822
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,910
Braxton? Hello?

823
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,830
Braxton?

824
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,700
Please don't hurt me.

825
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,910
I'm sorry. What?

826
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,750
Don't hurt me.

827
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,950
Why would you say that to me? What have I done to you? What...

828
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:27,000
Have I done anything at all that would give you the idea that I would do something to hurt you?

829
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,830
Why would you say that to me?

830
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,790
I'm sorry. 

831
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,500
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,040
Yeah.

833
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,120
That makes two of us.

834
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,000
Trying to have a conversation.

835
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,330
You kind of suck as a conversationalist.

836
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,830
I mean, I know there's a language barrier, but holy shit,

837
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,290
it's not like it's so fucking confusing what I'm saying to you.

839
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,660
Can't seem to find an office chair I like.

840
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,080
They're all so uncomfortable, you know?

841
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,000
You know, actually, it's not the chair.

842
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,370
I think maybe it's what you said about putting me there.

843
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:53,580
I don't feel like I've earned the job.

844
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,500
Maybe you need more lumbar support.

845
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,450
Costco has an excellent line of chairs that support the lower back.

846
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,750
Uh, never mind.

847
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,370
So, is your brother up to speed on the case?

848
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,410
Yes.

849
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,910
When was the last time you saw him?

850
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,700
Eight years ago, in Chicago.

851
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,000
Younger brother or older?

852
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,660
I'm two years older than Braxton.

853
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,410
He doesn't...

854
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,120
Is there something wrong?

855
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,620
He's just often very angry at me for no reason.

856
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,330
It's fine.

857
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,080
Well, I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.

858
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,580
Mm. Uh...

859
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,620
I-I get it. I have a sibling, too.

860
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,330
Maybe thank him for coming to help.

861
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,750
You know, tell him how glad you are to see him.

862
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,290
It's just been my experience 

863
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,290
that people want to be appreciated, you know?

864
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,000
That's him.

865
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,080
Hello, Braxton.

866
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,410
This is pretty.

867
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,410
Who are you?

868
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,870
I am Marybeth Medina,

869
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,330
deputy director of Financial Crimes Enforcement.

870
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,290
A Fed?

871
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,370
You suffer a stroke?

872
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:34,540
You're upset.

873
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,330
We're working together, so whatever...

874
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,790
profession you're in, I currently have zero interest.

875
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,000
Currently, huh?

876
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,370
Hey, gosh, that's great to hear.

877
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,660
Talk to you for a second?

878
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,290
So it's been a minute, yeah?

879
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:04,580
- Eight years, uh, two months. - That's right.

880
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,330
You look good, Chris.

881
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,620
I think so, too. I...

882
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,750
Braxton, thank you for coming.

883
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,160
I'm really glad you're here.

884
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,790
She tell you to say that?

885
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,830
Yeah.

887
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:29,540
Got to squirt.

888
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:33,540
Uh, just... 

889
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,620
Braxton, should we go over the plan again? 

890
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,910
What are you doing? Let me just take a piss, yeah?

891
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,200
Okay, and then we'll talk about the plan.

898
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,660
- Care what they look like? - Nah.

899
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,580
How many?

900
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,660
I'll send 'em up.

901
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,200
Appreciate it.

902
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,200
All righty.

903
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,830
My time's money, right?

904
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,290
Yes, I've heard that.

905
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,790
I'll send you an invoice.

906
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,290
Okay. Fair.

907
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,370
See how fair you think it is when you get the bill there, hotshot.

908
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,200
Oh, it's okay. I'm sure I can afford it.

909
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,830
"I'm sure I can afford it."

910
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,080
Braxton.

911
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,200
- "Braxton." - Braxton, don't repeat me.

912
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,540
"Braxton, don't repeat me."

913
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,830
- Braxton. - "Braxton."

914
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,620
You know I don't like...

915
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,080
Braxton, I'm asking you nicely.

916
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,830
- "Braxton, I really..." - Braxton.

917
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,620
All right, go...

918
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,580
just go stand over there, all right?

919
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,040
Don't be scary.

920
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:54,750
Let me do the talking.

921
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,250
Ladies.

922
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,000
Hola, papi.

923
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,040
Hola.

924
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,750
Make yourself at home.

925
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:03,870
Hola, hola.

926
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,870
Hola.

927
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,870
Hello.

928
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,580
- You must be the wild one, huh? - Oh.

929
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:14,290
Long as you don't rearrange the furniture, he's A-OK.

930
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,120
Let's just, uh... Okay. Let's just get this over with now, yeah?

931
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,120
Gracias.

934
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,120
De nada, de nada.

935
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:23,830
Here you go.

937
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,830
Thank you, ladies.

938
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,870
You know, me and my friend here, we were, uh... we were just talking.

939
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,750
Just, maybe you could settle something for us.

940
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,200
Now, what happens, you walk into a room like this,

941
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,580
two guys sitting here, all right, waiting for you--

942
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,120
what happens if things turn bad?

943
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,660
Now, look, it's... it's not us.

944
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,950
We're as tame as a tulip, okay?

945
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,250
I'm just wondering what happens if somebody puts their hands on you

946
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,790
a way you don't like, if... 

947
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,950
maybe we don't let you leave.

948
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,120
I imagine there's somebody 

949
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,330
you call in a situation like that, right?

950
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,450
Somebody whose job it is to show up here,

951
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,580
make sure you guys are okay.

952
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,580
Now, I want to be completely clear.

953
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,790
I'm not interested in names here. I could care less what his name is.

954
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,660
Just... 

955
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,750
what would it take for me to get that certain somebody

956
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,200
to show up here?

957
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,330
?Está loco este gringo?

961
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,700
Se llama Tomas.

962
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:22,870
His name is Tomas.

963
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,160
Braxton, remember? Tomas.

967
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:32,580
What? What?

969
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,120
No, no, no, no, no.

970
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,790
Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay.

976
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,160
Piensa en Juárez.

977
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,330
?Qué pasa en Juárez?

978
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,330
Juárez is none of your business.

979
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,370
Vámonos.

982
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,500
Eres una estúpida.

983
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,790
That's your money. You take it.

984
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,040
Vámonos.

985
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,540
Thank you, ladies.

986
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,580
It'll take a lot more than this to get away from those people.

987
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,830
Okay. Okay.

988
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,750
Come on, Mr. "I Can Afford It." Pay the lady.

989
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,330
I'm risking my life.

990
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:45,500
Really?

991
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,290
There we go.

993
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,870
Tomas is real mean.

994
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,080
Understood.

995
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,790
And you're gonna hurt him?

996
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,370
Would you like us to?

997
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:15,700
Please.

998
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:18,750
Okay.

999
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,950
Tomas.

1001
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,950
They won't let us leave.

1003
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:49,950
Okay. 

1004
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,790
Gracias.

1005
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,700
I am in room 235.

1006
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,000
Okay.

1007
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,500
Uh, look like?

1008
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,450
Accountants.

1010
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,950
Okay, boss. Bye.

1011
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,160
Thank you.

1012
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,580
I don't have kids.

1013
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,450
Sorkis.

1014
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,830
Hey, it's Marybeth. What do you got for me?

1015
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,540
Traffic cam footage.

1017
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,000
Sharing my screens with you now.

1018
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,910
Only two camera angles in that area.

1019
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,250
King enters...

1020
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,200
He's inside 45 minutes.

1021
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,120
Figure gunshots here.

1022
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,870
Place stampedes.

1023
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,080
Nothing.

1024
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,620
Shooter could be anybody.

1025
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,750
King exits 90 seconds later.

1026
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,330
Um, any luck calling Emiliano Gonzalez, 

1027
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,660
guy on Ray's client list?

1028
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:23,040
Edith's father. Yes and no.

1029
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,330
Gonzalez residence.

1030
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,410
Is Emiliano Gonzalez there?

1031
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,830
Yes and no.

1032
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,950
Mr. Gonzalez had reported his daughter and young family missing

1033
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,290
seven years ago.

1034
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:44,830
Well, what happened to 'em?

1035
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,250
Cartels kidnap migrants for ransom 

1036
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,080
or for sale to traffickers.

1037
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,330
And if they can't ransom or sell?

1038
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,700
You get this.

1040
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,040
Gino Sanchez.

1041
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,580
I got to call you back.

1042
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,410
You got my fucking bitches, asshole.

1043
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,250
Full disclosure: assholes.

1044
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,750
Mariella!

1045
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,080
- She's just in the back getting freshened up. - Mariella!

1046
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,160
Hey, come on, man. We got Wi-Fi and everything. 

1047
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,910
Come on in, no? Mariella!

1048
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:43,910
Guess I hit him harder than I thought.

1049
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:45,700
He's alive.

1050
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,450
Yeah. Get my shit.

1051
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,950
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1052
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,450
What, are we kidnappers now?

1053
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,330
Ah, kidnapping. That's pretty harsh, isn't it? 

1054
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:57,040
We merely, uh... We detained him.

1055
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,040
For questioning.

1056
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,080
Uh, no, we have no right to detain anyone.

1057
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,790
This man may know who killed Ray King.

1058
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,250
Do you want to know what he knows or not?

1059
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,750
I-If the cops stop me,

1060
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,160
if-if they search the trunk, what then, genius?

1061
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,000
Hello, dreamboat.

1062
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,410
Do you have my location?

1063
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,250
Yes.

1064
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,410
I need green lights from here to Victory Boulevard.

1065
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,200
And please call in a fake robbery

1066
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,200
ten blocks south of here to distract the police

1067
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,870
until Marybeth gets safely home to the Airbnb.

1068
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,790
- Damn. - Anything else?

1069
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,040
I need to know who Ray King was meeting with.

1070
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:27,790
Okay?

1071
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,080
Pretty good, no?

1072
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,080
Okay.

1073
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:34,750
Go eat something or...

1074
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,580
Taco Bell.

1075
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,500
There we go.

1077
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,660
Good morning, boys and girls.

1078
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,580
Who wants to brute-force the city of Los Angeles?

1080
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:05,120
We have Chris and his friend joining us remotely this morning.

1081
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,830
They would like us to find and identify a person of interest.

1082
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,870
Let's prepare to examine all traffic and security cameras.

1083
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,830
Okay, so I've been looking at the footage Homeland sent.

1084
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,370
Ray goes in, comes out 45 minutes later.

1085
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,660
We don't even know for sure if he was there to meet anyone at all.

1086
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,040
Why don't we just, uh, 

1087
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,580
get that Tomas guy to tell us where Cobb's at?

1088
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,120
And how are we gonna do that exactly?

1089
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,910
If you just take out his eye, right, you show it to him?

1090
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,000
And then you just say you're gonna take the other one out

1091
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,120
unless he starts talking.

1092
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,950
It works every time. It's, like, a ten out of ten.

1093
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,160
Nobody wants to be blind, right?

1094
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,080
You show 'em the one eye, they know you're serious.

1095
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,620

1096
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:45,950
Good morning.

1097
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,950
I've warmed up the orchestra.

1098
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,000
We are looking for your person now.

1099
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,500
Finding footage from the day of the incident.

1100
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,660
Isolating street cameras.

1101
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,540
Look, my guy at Homeland,

1102
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,160
he has a doctorate in computer science from Caltech.

1103
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,290
He can access every database you can name and some you can't.

1104
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,700
There were only two cameras recording that night.

1105
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,120
I'm sure the kids at Harbor are bright, 

1106
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,500
but we are wasting time.

1107
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:15,700
Oh, look.

1108
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,370
Here are the other cameras you were looking for, 

1109
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:21,790
Deputy Director Medina.

1110
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,910
You can unmute your mic now.

1111
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,700
Everyone take a feed and look 

1112
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,040
for anything suspicious between 8:00 and 10:00 p.m.

1113
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,450
Lane, let's see the front entrance, 

1114
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,950
post-gunfire.

1115
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,160
Aidan, what's happening in the back?

1116
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,660
Look for any behavior that doesn't match the situation.

1117
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,790
Go back. Zoom in on the front door.

1118
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:02,200
Reverse. That is our person of interest.

1119
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,410
She's not hurrying.

1120
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,160
She's not afraid.

1121
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,120
Let's find her before she arrived.

1122
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,290
Check every alley and street.

1123
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,910
Cover four square blocks around Vermont and 19th.

1124
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:22,540
She's hiding her face. She knows where the cameras are.

1126
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,750
Miles, reverse.

1127
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:30,500
Pink Jacket is taking a selfie.

1128
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,000
Let's get that photo.

1129
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,160
There's no way they can zoom in on her phone screen from that angle.

1130
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,410
They don't have to. They'll identify the woman 

1131
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,120
and find likely passwords, hack into the phone 

1132
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,410
and email the selfie.

1133
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,500
Yeah, okay. Sure.

1134
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,830
Heavy sigh.

1135
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,410
Would you like to bring the normie up to speed, Chris?

1136
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,870
That's what I would do.

1137
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,120
Run facial scan for I.D., please.

1138
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,410
- I got it. - I got it.

1139
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,830
Chris, Lane and Charles are going head-to-head for this one.

1141
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,200
Hello, Pam. Let's get to know each other.

1143
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,330
Iowa. Birthplace of the world's first computer.

1144
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,450
Let's pay Pam's a visit.

1145
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,660
Aidan, that zip code 

1146
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,410
is serviced by Midwest Power and Energy.

1147
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,290
They're entering from the utility company.

1148
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,200
They'll jump to an unsecured printer on the network

1149
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,370
or a smart thermostat.

1151
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:39,580
Who are these kids?

1152
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,160
My people.

1153
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,120
There are more of us than you think,

1154
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,250
Deputy Director Medina.

1155
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,950
Skye, we need the password to the smart home network.

1159
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,000
Good morning, Iowa.

1160
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,040
Good morning, Pam.

1161
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,290
Let's not let Pam get comfortable.

1162
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,540
This isn't right.

1163
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:16,870
Lane, get her out of that chair

1164
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,290
and let's go find that photo.

1167
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:29,750
Miles, have that page ready when she comes back.

1168
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,700
Charles, get into her photo library.

1169
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,250
We-we can't do this. Tell her to stop.

1170
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,290
Chris, please explain to the normie

1171
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,250
we need to finish what we've started.

1172
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:44,870
Red light.

1173
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,830
Aidan, your turn.

1175
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,370
Green light.

1176
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,450
Tell her to stop.

1177
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:03,450
Here she comes. Red light.

1178
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,500
Lane, let the neighbors hear that TV.

1180
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,500
All in... all in the butter.

1181
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,040
Yeah, yeah. All that butter.

1182
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,410
All right, all that butter, and then...

1183
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,750
A little bit of salt.

1184
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:23,700
Mm-hmm.

1186
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,290
Tell her to stop now.

1187
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,750
Chris, enough. Stop.

1188
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,120
Tell her to stop.

1189
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,000
Stop this now.

1190
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,660
Here's her selfie. Aidan, email photo.

1192
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:48,580
- You can actually taste the sweetness. - Yeah.

1193
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,830
Oh, I love that. 

1194
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,790
That, my friend, is an Iowan response.

1196
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,910
Skye, get us out.

1198
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,120
He says he does it every morning.

1199
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,620
- It's so good. - You like the raw better?

1200
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,410
I like the raw better.

1201
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,080
Proud of you. You are now a true Iowan.

1202
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,200
Miles, enhance, please.

1203
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,700
Running Interpol facial recognition.

1213
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,120
It looks like she was the last person to speak to Ray,

1214
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:54,080
but she doesn't want to be found.

1215
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,870
Goodbye, dreamboat.

1218
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:19,290
Why would Ray meet with someone who killed all these people

1219
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,950
to find a mother and child?

1220
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,200
She didn't kill all those people.

1221
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:28,370
I'm just saying, she definitely didn't kill that one or...

1222
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,620
that one right there, so...

1223
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,290
How do you know that?

1224
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,700
Eh... just kind of throwing it out there, that's all, you know.

1225
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,700
Just a hunch.

1226
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,790
Educated guess.

1227
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:43,080
That's all it is, really.

1228
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,250
He has no way of knowing.

1229
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,500
Yeah, I'm just...

1230
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:46,870
- It's hypothetical. - True. 

1231
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,620
- Stop talking. - Okay.

1232
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,870
- Regardless... - Oh, fuck no.

1233
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,700
I... 

1234
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,250
Do you... do you often confess to capital murder?

1235
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,500
I actually didn't say anything, if you think about it.

1236
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,830
I literally made a gesture. 

1237
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:01,790
I guess that bothered her.

1238
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:03,870
Goodbye. That's it. I'm out.

1239
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,370
Okay. One moment, Marybeth, please, 

1240
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,500
for your time. One thing that you may want to consider

1241
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,330
is some of those men whose pictures were on the wall

1242
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,910
may have... may not have been killed,

1243
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,290
were likely very unsavory characters...

1244
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,370
It doesn't fucking matter if they're unsavory!

1245
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,040
We don't get to decide who lives and who dies.

1246
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,660
- Apparently, I do. - Braxton.

1247
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,250
The law is what separates us from people like him.

1248
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,910
Been a pleasure and an honor.

1249
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,120
Uh, hope we get to work with each other again.

1250
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,410
Uh, you take care and stay safe.

1252
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:34,160
Fuck.

1255
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,370
We have a problem. 

1256
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,910
- Is it the man in the trunk? - It is.

1257
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,080
Sounds like you got a problem.

1258
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,040
Remove him, please.

1259
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,450
And-and do what with him?

1260
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,660
I'm going to the state's attorney general.

1261
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,410
Sure am glad it's not my car.

1262
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,120
You know what, I made a mistake calling you.

1263
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,830
Okay? I'm gonna do this myself,

1264
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,200
by the book, no more lying, no more breaking the law.

1265
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,790
Tell the Brit no more tips.

1266
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,040
And don't be here when I get back.

1267
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,080
If I see either of you again, I'll have you arrested.

1270
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:08,620
Ms. Gutierrez, I'm confused.

1271
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:12,450
The only thing that my client is guilty of

1272
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,500
is coming to the aid of a young lady in distress,

1273
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:19,450
after which he was attacked, beaten and kidnapped.

1274
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,200
But instead of pursuing these men,

1275
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:26,160
you hold this Cobb individual over my client's head,

1276
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:30,450
threatened him with prison time amidst accusations of human trafficking?

1277
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:33,410
In what bizarro legal world

1278
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,160
do you imagine getting a grand jury indictment?

1279
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,200
Funny.

1280
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:41,450
Exactly what Ike Sudio's lawyer said

1281
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,330
when I offered the same plea deal to his client.

1282
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,750
I do not know Mr. Sudio.

1283
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,620
Looks like your client does.

1284
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,620
Now, what you don't see are

1285
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:54,080
the bite marks on Sudio's tongue and the rat.

1286
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,950
It went into his mouth when both were still alive.

1287
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:59,290
Now-- and this is just a hunch--

1288
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,750
I'm guessing Ike was more important than a pimp.

1289
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,250
What do you think they'll do to you?

1290
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,660
Okay, we're done here.

1291
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,080
I should note Mr. Sudio's attorney is missing.

1293
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,660
In or out?

1294
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:38,540
Ike washed the fucking money, man.

1295
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:41,160
Money made from human trafficking?

1296
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,910
Most are from Central America, Mexico.

1297
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,370
Like drugs, only better.

1298
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,290
A good earner lasts five, six years.

1299
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,290
Mostly women--

1300
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:54,950
on their backs, in the fields, scrubbing toilets.

1301
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,040
Some men-- picking melons, slaughterhouse kill floors.

1302
01:08:58,330 --> 01:08:59,830
Any job an American won't fucking do 

1303
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:01,870
and a machine can't.

1304
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,830
Recognize him?

1305
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,410
No.

1306
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,660
This was taken eight years ago.

1307
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,200
Oh, yeah.

1308
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,540
Bitch would work a good man to death.

1309
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,950
She threw down a few times, but she was too quiet, 

1310
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,160
so... did maid work mainly.

1311
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,250
Her name is Edith. Where is she?

1312
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:32,700
She T-boned a car outside a parking garage on Alvarado

1313
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,450
four, five years ago.

1314
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,370
So she's dead?

1315
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:37,620
No. Heard she went through the windshield, though.

1316
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:39,330
Too secondhand for us.

1317
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:40,370
What hospital?

1318
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,540
Fuck would I know?

1319
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,830
She had a father in Texas. Why wouldn't she go to him for help?

1320
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:44,910
Ask him.

1321
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,120
We're asking you.

1322
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,830
You put everything on the record, you get immunity in exchange 

1323
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:51,950
for your testimony.

1324
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,080
Last chance.

1325
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,290
Give me the fucking pen.

1326
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:07,950
Fuck!

1327
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:09,700
Get down!

1328
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:24,160
18 reported accidents within the garage in the last five years.

1329
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,540
None serious, none on that level.

1330
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:28,580
What street did the garage exit out to?

1331
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,290
Alvarado. 32 accidents within a mile radius,

1332
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,540
three with serious bodily injuries.

1333
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:37,200
Did any of those involve a vehicle exiting a garage?

1334
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:38,450
One.

1335
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,330
Injuries?

1336
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:40,950
One, critical.

1337
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,580
An unidentified woman, sole occupant.

1338
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,540
Hospital?

1339
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,540
University Medical Center.

1340
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,450
Vehicle?

1341
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,120
Toyota Camry.

1342
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:50,330
Color?

1343
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:52,620
Blue.

1344
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,700
Explore the medical center's patient files.

1345
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,370
Thank you.

1346
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,950
"I don't have kids."

1347
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,540
Thank God for that.

1348
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,830
What?

1349
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,450
What?

1350
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,040
The woman at the hotel, she said, "I don't have kids."

1351
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:12,870
Yeah, I remember, man.

1352
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,160
You got to let it go already.

1353
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:16,700
Well, I'm saying, why is that significant?

1354
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:19,080
Why is being a mother important?

1355
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:19,950
You know, man, 

1356
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,160
I don't think you and I are really authorities on the importance of motherly love, 

1357
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:24,500
I hate to tell you.

1358
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,750
This is it, huh?

1359
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,870
Live in a lunch box.

1360
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,790
It's quite comfortable.

1361
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,450
Well, so is the Four Seasons. Or a house.

1362
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:41,120
Cheap like Pop. Tighter than bark on a tree, aren't you?

1363
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,790
No, he wasn't cheap. He was frugal.

1364
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:43,910
- He was frugal? - Yes.

1365
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,830
Bullshit.

1366
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,040
"Seven T-shirts, seven pairs of underwear and socks

1367
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,250
is all I need."

1368
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:52,910
Fucking grown man wearing a Timex, dude. He was fucking pathetic. 

1369
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,950
Look at that.

1370
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,910
- See that? - Yes.

1371
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,950
It's worth more than he made in a year.

1372
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,250
What do you think he'd say about this?

1373
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:01,080
He would say it's the same time on his watch.

1374
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:05,160
He probably would, wouldn't he?

1375
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,200
Are you happy, Braxton?

1376
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,160
Am I happy?

1377
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:13,370
Yes.

1378
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,120
Yeah. 

1379
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:17,500
Yeah, man, of course I'm happy. Why wouldn't I be happy?

1380
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,250
You're a transient. You have no significant other.

1381
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:22,250
You're completely alone, no friends or...

1382
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,330
nothing, you have no...

1383
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,410
We talking about me or we talking about you?

1384
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,160
You ever thought about why I'm alone, Chris?

1385
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:35,080
'Cause you're abrasive or selfish or...

1386
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,120
well, you swear too often.

1387
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,750
Dude, I'm alone because I... I want to be alone.

1388
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:40,200
I choose to be alone.

1389
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:43,580
I don't have anybody that I got to answer to, you know,

1390
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,750
check in with.

1391
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,790
I-I travel the world. I stay at five-star hotels.

1392
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,040
I do what I want when I want it.

1393
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,120
Have gun, will travel, motherfucker.

1394
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,950
I mean, yeah. Shit yeah, I'm happy.

1395
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,330
I'm fucking happy. Bet your ass I'm happy.

1396
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:58,540
I'd like to have someone to check in on.

1397
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,080
- Yeah? - Yes.

1398
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,540
Well, get a dog.

1399
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,080
Do you have a dog?

1400
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,120
I'm getting a dog.

1401
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:07,370
Look at this.

1402
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,450
Yeah.

1403
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,250
That's Greg.

1404
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,250
Unconvincing.

1405
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:15,200
What do you mean "unconvincing"?

1406
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,330
That's Greg. I'm getting this dog.

1407
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,580
Well, you like the idea of a dog.

1408
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,120
Anybody who has a dog likes the idea of getting a dog.

1409
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,080
It's why they got the dog in the first place.

1410
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,040
- Do you have a permanent residence? - No.

1411
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,160
- Anyone to care for your dog during long absences? - I do not. 

1412
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,830
- Do you keep a regular schedule

1413
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,000
- in terms of eating, sleeping? - No, I don't.

1414
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,200
You're a cat person.

1415
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,500
There's nothing wrong with that.

1416
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,160
Well, you know something, if I had a cat, at least the cat would miss me.

1417
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:40,410
Doubtful.

1418
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,290
Possible.

1419
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,580
Nah.

1420
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,700
Chris, is it because of you or because of me?

1421
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:00,540
What?

1422
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,620
That you, like...

1423
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,290
- What? - You...

1424
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,040
- I don't understand. - You don't...

1425
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,950
You just, like, 

1426
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:13,200
don't, like...

1427
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:15,620
like, miss me.

1428
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,250
Like, is that 'cause of you or me?

1429
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,910
I spent years looking for you.

1430
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,410
I was just trying to track you down, but you don't look for me at all.

1431
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,620
And then I finally find you,

1432
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,540
and I... 

1433
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:31,620
you know, I was there, I saved your life.

1434
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,660
And you said that you would come and find me. You said...

1435
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,250
you would come and find me soon, and then you just disappeared again, 

1436
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:40,250
I guess.

1437
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:41,870
You had my phone number.

1438
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,790
I guess what I'm asking you, man, is, like...

1439
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,790
Do you not miss me because of me, or is it...

1440
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,660
- ...is it 'cause of your, like... - My what? 

1441
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,830
You know, your... your condition.

1442
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:13,450
I'm just me.

1443
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:30,500
What are you doing?

1444
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,830
I am applying sunscreen to my lower extremities.

1445
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,500
This is 100 SPF.

1446
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,910
I had more than four sunburns in my childhood,

1447
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,500
so we're more than twice as likely to develop melanoma as adults.

1448
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,540
- I take precautions. - Can I get a little bit?

1449
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,830
- Yeah, sure. - Can I get some? Thanks, man.

1450
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:54,620
You know I don't like that.

1451
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,160
That's not funny, Braxton. I like thing...

1452
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:59,450
Oh, it's so funny.

1453
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,620
- I want to sock your mouth sometimes. - It's so funny.

1454
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,370
You know what I think?

1455
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,870
I think we got to go get drunk.

1456
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,620
Come on, man.

1457
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,200
Let's go get drunk.

1458
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:11,700
Okay.

1460
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,870
? Son, you finally got it made ?

1461
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,500
? Old Hank made it here 

1462
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,450
and we're all sure that you will ?

1463
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,620
? but I don't think Hank done it this way ?

1464
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,620
? I don't think old Hank done it this way...

1465
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,410
I don't know if it's, uh, exactly what I had in mind, you know?

1466
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:33,830
I mean, it's... it's L.A.

1467
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,500
To me, that means nightclubs,

1468
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:39,000
valets, velvet ropes, douchebags everywhere.

1469
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,200
Not really a honky-tonk type town, you know?

1470
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,410
I don't know, I just never took you for, like,

1471
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,160
a country-western kind of guy, but 

1472
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,750
it's cool. I mean, 

1473
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:50,080
I guess you pretend to be an ordinary accountant,

1474
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,950
you can, uh, pretend to be a cowboy tonight, right?

1475
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,080
No. Yes. Okay.

1476
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,910
What do you mean "no, yes, okay"?

1477
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:00,330
Are we having a conversation here, Chris?

1478
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:02,870
By the way, as far as the whole cowboy thing,

1479
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,620
I think the Forrest Gump shoes, they're a bit of a misfire, but...

1480
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:06,410
Well...

1481
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,910
"Well" what? What?

1482
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,120
Hey, now.

1483
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,120
Hello.

1484
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:11,410
Band's looking for requests.

1485
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,500
Is there a song you like, handsome?

1486
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:16,120
I guess I'm good with, like, Alan Jackson, something like that.

1487
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,000
Tell 'em that'll, uh... that'll do me just fine, sweetheart.

1488
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,080
Okay, slow down, Night Moves.

1489
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:22,950
I was, uh, asking him.

1490
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:25,950
I'm Angie.

1491
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,250
Hello, Angie. My name is Chris.

1492
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:31,750
What's your favorite tune, Chris?

1493
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:34,660
My favorite song is "Appalachian Spring" by Copland.

1494
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:37,830
Second favorite.

1495
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:39,950
Uh... in this context, yes.

1496
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:43,290
Metallica, "Enter Sandman."

1497
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,580
I don't think that's in their wheelhouse.

1498
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:48,700
Ah, yeah.

1499
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,700
Maybe you should ask someone more familiar with the band's capabilities.

1500
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:56,870
Okay.

1501
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,160
- No. - I...

1502
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:00,660
- No. - What?

1503
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,790
What are you do... You were right there. Why'd you... 

1504
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:04,410
- why'd you go down like that? - What was I supposed to say?

1505
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,950
You were going up. It was working.

1506
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,250
What were you supposed to say? 

1507
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:09,160
Just say, "You pick," you know?

1508
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,250
But she asked me what my favorite song was.

1509
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:13,500
- Dude, she wasn't asking you... - Yes, she did. She asked me. 

1510
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,040
- Because she liked you. - She lit... 

1511
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,870
I-I'm just as shocked as you are, but she liked you. 

1512
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:17,700
That's why she came here.

1513
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,160
I don't know, it was like a mating call.

1514
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,500
I mean, how do you not see... It doesn't... 

1515
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:23,040
My brain doesn't work that way, Braxton.

1516
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,200
Look, dude, I... Hey, 

1517
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,450
hey, hey, hey.

1518
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:31,450
It was good.

1519
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,410
You hear me? It was good.

1520
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,750
But, I mean, it seemed like you were seeing it, and she was seeing it. 

1521
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:37,160
- Yes. - It was just... 

1522
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,750
you made her smile.

1523
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:41,040
I mean, I don't know what the-the first thing you said,

1524
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,160
but the Metallica thing, that... it was funny.

1525
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:46,000
You know, it could've been perceived as, I-I don't know, like, cute or something like that, 

1526
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,540
but it definitely made her smile.

1527
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:50,200
I think maybe you don't give yourself enough credit.

1528
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:51,660
You're just, like, sort of...

1529
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,040
What are you gonna do, man?

1530
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:56,160
You... going to piss? Where are you going?

1531
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:02,750
? He only came to town about twice a year ?

1532
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:09,250
? He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line ?

1533
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:15,500
? Everybody knew that he made moonshine...

1534
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,790
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1535
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:23,500
? Headed up the holler with everything he had ?

1536
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,580
? Before my time, but I've been told ?

1537
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:27,910
? he never come back from Copperhead Road...

1538
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,700
You got it. Ready?

1539
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,410
There you go. 

1540
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:32,950
Hey.

1541
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:40,040
Get the fuck out of...

1542
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,500
? Now, Daddy ran the whiskey in a big-block Dodge ?

1544
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:51,500
? Bought it at an auction at the Masons' lodge ?

1545
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,620
? "Johnson County Sheriff" painted on the side ?

1546
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:03,660
? He just shot a coat of primer, then he looked inside ?

1547
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:09,500
? Well, him and my uncle shut that engine down ?

1548
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,540
? Well, I still remember that rumblin' sound... ?

1549
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,910
Hey!

1550
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Hey, hey!

1551
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:20,620
? The sheriff came around in the middle of the night ?

1552
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,290
? Heard Mama cryin', knew somethin' wasn't right ?

1553
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:26,370
? He headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load ?

1554
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,040
? You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road... ?

1555
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,290
Let's go!

1556
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,910
Kick!

1557
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,910
Hey, you see that? That's my brother.

1558
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,120
That's my big brother up there.

1559
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:55,160
? Copperhead Road ?

1560
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:59,870
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

1561
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:01,790
I'm sorry.

1563
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,120
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

1564
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,870
- Thank you. - So he dances.

1565
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,830
Well...

1566
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,290
Well, I'll be dipped in dog shit.

1567
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,040
Oh, hello.

1568
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,500
That was some dancing.

1569
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,750
Light on your feet, big man.

1570
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:25,160
Thank you. Yes. I'm a beginner. It's my first time, so...

1571
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,290
It wasn't a compliment, hoss. 

1572
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,950
Jerry. Don't start. 

1573
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,000
Hey. Hey. 

1574
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,700
- Eyes forward, son. - Whoa. Well, that's not kind.

1575
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:34,580
Hey, I don't think you heard me.

1576
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,910
Look at me when I'm fucking talking to you.

1577
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,790
Hey.

1578
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:38,620
Hey, come on.

1579
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,040
You're in cowboy country.

1580
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:40,790
Oh, I see.

1581
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:43,450
We don't mess with another man's girl down here.

1582
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,160
You're from Glendale, Gerald, 

1583
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,250
and I'm not your girl.

1584
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:49,330
It's okay. My brother wasn't having a good time tonight, but now he will.

1585
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,660
Okay, hit me, Jerry.

1586
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:53,000
- Well, your brother can get it, too. - Oh, good.

1587
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,580
Your face is like an anus.

1588
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,120
Swing at me, Jerry! Oh, no.

1589
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,910
Khaki Pants here wants to scrap.

1590
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,950
- Jerry. - Oh, goodness gracious.

1591
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,040
Fucking hit him.

1592
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,700
- Hey. Show him what you got, Jerry. - Here, hold this.

1593
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:02,450
Get him, Jerry. 

1594
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:03,700
- Knuckle up, motherfucker. - I'm prepared. 

1595
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:05,290
- Guys, stop. - Knuckle up, motherfucker. 

1596
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:07,870
Hey. Stop. Jerry.

1597
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,830
- Oh, come on now. - Go, Jerry!

1598
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:24,830
Goddamn!

1599
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,660
Is there anything in this world better than punching

1600
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:29,120
a motherfucker in the face who's got it coming? Huh?

1601
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:30,330
- Well... - Huh? What?

1603
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,830
- No. - Yes.

1604
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:34,040
Shut the front door.

1605
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:34,950
You! Hey!

1606
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:35,870
Yes. Ha!

1607
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:36,910
Hey! 

1608
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,660
- I'm very smooth. - You!

1609
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,540
You, look at you!

1610
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:41,580
I'm sorry, it was, uh, Miss...

1612
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,120
Deputy Director Medina.

1613
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,080
Yeah, well, patient files past and present require a subpoena.

1614
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,580
I'm quite sure you know that, Miss Medina.

1615
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,330
Yes, I do.

1616
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:51,160
A woman and her child disappeared eight years ago.

1617
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,370
Now they're either dead or living a nightmare.

1618
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,500
Look, could you just do this for me, please?

1619
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,250
I really need your help, and I just... I...

1620
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:59,250
Yeah, and I need a court order to do so.

1621
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:00,500
Now, I'm sorry.

1622
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:05,700
Hey.

1623
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:14,580
Harbor Neuroscience.

1624
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,830
The Harbor Neuroscience?

1625
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,700
Treasury and Harbor have partnered to support

1626
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:22,040
health care professionals who work with individuals

1627
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,620
possessing unique abilities.

1628
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:26,660
Define "support."

1629
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,660
Here we go.

1630
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:37,910
Jane Doe 636.

1631
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:40,500
Five years ago.

1632
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,580
Skull fracture, jaw, ribs, left arm broken.

1633
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:44,830
And extensive facial injuries as a result of an auto accident.

1636
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:48,580
Delirious, 

1637
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,000
in and out of consciousness when she arrived.

1638
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:55,160
Said something about being attacked by somebody.

1640
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,910
Prior to reconstructive surgery,

1641
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,250
she was exposed to neuro-rehabilitation strategies

1642
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,870
I designed to treat individuals with extensive brain trauma.

1643
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,750
How extensive?

1644
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,910
A nearly total loss of memory.

1646
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,950
I played top boards in college.

1647
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,660
If Jane ever played, she didn't remember how.

1648
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,000
That's three days later?

1649
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,040
Acquired savant syndrome.

1650
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:24,290
So rare some neurologists doubt it exists.

1651
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:25,660
But you don't?

1652
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:29,750
Victims of blunt force trauma

1653
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:31,500
can, on extremely rare occasions,

1654
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:33,910
exhibit extraordinary outcomes.

1655
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:38,540
A woman who's never played piano fractures her skull in a fall,

1656
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:40,750
masters Rachmaninoff in a day.

1657
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:44,410
A baseball fan takes a 90-mile-per-hour foul ball

1658
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:45,620
to the head and wakes to discover

1659
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,750
he can learn a foreign language in an afternoon.

1660
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,250
How is that possible?

1661
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:51,410
Their brains, 

1662
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,080
for lack of a better word, are rewired, 

1663
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,620
unlocking hidden abilities,

1664
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,080
abilities that, at least theoretically, we all possess.

1665
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,040
And Jane's talent was chess?

1666
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:02,790
No.

1667
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,660
Not exactly.

1669
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,040
The brain injury Jane suffered lit up her frontal and parietal cortex.

1670
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:09,830
Checkmate.

1671
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,830
Those areas responsible for pattern recognition, problem solving,

1672
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,910
critical thinking.

1673
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:14,910
The same areas of the brain chess masters rely on.

1675
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:20,370
Caveat is their abilities start and stop with chess.

1676
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,290
In Jane Doe, they didn't.

1677
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,370
Acquired savant syndrome

1678
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,580
would explain the exponential acceleration of her ability

1679
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,250
to decode and assimilate information,

1680
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,160
the hand-eye coordination,

1681
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:38,080
but what it doesn't explain is why her memory was all but erased.

1682
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:41,250
Or the personality change.

1683
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:43,700
My theory?

1684
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,450
The trauma that rewired her brain

1685
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,290
also unplugged any unnecessary neural networks.

1686
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,790
Unnecessary for...?

1687
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:55,830
Survival.

1688
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,160
The brain's frontal lobes are also where our fight-or-flight decisions are made.

1690
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,200
I think the appeal of chess wasn't strategy...

1691
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,370
...but combat.

1692
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,620
I don't know what Jane's life was like prior to the accident,

1693
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:14,950
but whoever she was when they brought her in...

1695
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:22,540
...wasn't the same person who left.

1696
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,200
Over the following months, she became

1698
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,330
increasingly isolated. Aggressive.

1699
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,330
Until one night, 

1700
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:37,080
she beat a security guard unconscious,

1701
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:38,700
took his gun...

1702
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,580
...and disappeared.

1703
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,910
Y-You said her memory was all but erased.

1704
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,870
D-Did she retain any memory of her life before the accident?

1705
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,500
Family, kids, anything?

1706
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,120
Yeah, I asked her that exact question multiple times.

1707
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,160
Only once did she come up with something.

1708
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:03,250
Let's go back over family.

1709
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:08,910
Um, any memory of children or a husband?

1710
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:19,290
"Pop! Goes the Weasel"?

1711
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,910
So, should we order in some dinner?

1712
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:27,950
Discuss the grant? Next steps?

1713
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,370
Uh, the applications are in my car.

1714
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:32,620
I'll be right back.

1715
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:45,750
You're asking me to divulge the identity of a woman

1716
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:49,160
who may or may not be under my employment.

1717
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,580
I know she works for us, Batu.

1718
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,330
And, uh, you know this how?

1719
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,910
Half those jobs I turned down...

1720
01:27:57,660 --> 01:27:58,700
I just... 

1721
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,080
I just want to talk to her. That's all.

1722
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:02,540
Talk to her? 

1723
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,160
Why?

1724
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:07,790
It's-it's a family thing.

1725
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:09,330
Don't tell me.

1726
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,950
The one man I'd terminate 

1727
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,000
for free minus one very inconvenient fact.

1728
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,830
I know. He's my brother.

1729
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:17,830
No.

1730
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:20,330
He might kill all my killers.

1732
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:25,660
I'm going to bed.

1733
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,250
Braxton, 

1734
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:31,830
tell me that engine of destruction isn't with you now.

1735
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:33,330
No, sir, he is not.

1736
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:37,370
Because the last time you had a family thing, it nearly ruined me.

1737
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:38,910
Makes two of us.

1738
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,450
- Since you're in Los Angeles... - Yeah? 

1739
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:44,750
We have a new client

1740
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:47,540
whose in-house hitter isn't getting the job done.

1741
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,620
Sending a photo now.

1742
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:53,580
Instructions to follow only if we engage.

1744
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,160
I will let you know soon 

1745
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:58,450
if I need your services.

1746
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,160
"Piensa en Juárez."

1747
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,540
Juárez. Why Juárez?

1748
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,120
"I don't have kids."

1749
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:45,950
"I don't have kids."

1750
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:53,870
Why didn't Edith Sanchez call her father?

1751
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,870
Negative consequence.

1752
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,790
Is her father a danger?

1753
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:06,040
A school.

1754
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:11,620
It's not a school, is it?

1755
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,540
It's a...

1756
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:17,870
It's a prison.

1757
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:20,870
Why?

1758
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:25,120
Because of you.

1759
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:28,660
Edith was afraid for you.

1760
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,790
Afraid they would hurt you.

1763
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:53,370
Medina's at the Airbnb.

1764
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:55,330
Call her, then the police.

1765
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:56,700
Is that wise?

1766
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:59,620
You're an escaped convict from a federal penitentiary.

1767
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:03,000
Anything else?

1768
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,790
We found Edith Sanchez.

1769
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:09,580
Ray King wasn't murdered because he was looking for Edith.

1770
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:13,080
He was murdered because he found her.

1771
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:14,910
Call Marybeth now.

1772
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,700
Tell her I'm on my way.

1773
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:19,330
And we need to find Edith's son Alberto.

1774
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:21,750
He's being held as a prisoner in Juárez.

1775
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:25,080
Okay, Chris. Understood.

1776
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,620
Hello?

1777
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:56,580
Someone's coming to kill you.

1778
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,000
Marybeth?

1779
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:01,830
Hello? 

1780
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:03,290
Hello?

1781
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:05,450
Drop it. Drop it!

1782
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,120
Turn around.

1783
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:14,870
I'm a federal agent. Big mistake.

1784
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:19,540
Only if your name is not Marybeth Medina.

1785
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:25,870
Hands!

1786
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:29,040
Down on your knees.

1787
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:30,830
Now!

1788
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:27,500
?Mamá! ?Mami!

1793
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,500
?No!

1795
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,660
You're Edith Sanchez.

1796
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,620
Not anymore.

1797
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:36,660
I think your child is a prisoner in a compound in Juárez.

1798
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,250
It's okay.

1799
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:57,160
I need to put pressure on this.

1800
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:05,000
Help is coming.

1801
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:08,250
No, no. I-I paid you to kill her,

1802
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,870
not to try and kill her.

1803
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:12,500
Someone intervened in the hit.

1804
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:16,160
An extraordinarily lethal someone.

1805
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:19,370
Our contracts are enforced until the target is dead

1806
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:21,620
or the client's expired.

1807
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,540
Enjoy your evening.

1808
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:58,000
Go to Juárez.

1809
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,620
Take those kids into the desert.

1810
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,410
I want 'em dead and buried.

1811
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:11,660
No trace.

1812
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:14,830
Nothing to tie me to them.

1813
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,750
Think you can handle that?

1814
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:27,660
Yeah, Burke.

1815
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,250
Yeah, I can handle that.

1816
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,620
You show up in Juárez, and then what?

1817
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,120
How you even gonna find these kids?

1818
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,790
Not your concern. You can leave.

1819
01:38:49,870 --> 01:38:51,620
For Christ's sake. How many times do I got to tell you?

1820
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,950
What happened to Medina was not my fault.

1821
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,330
All right? She said she wanted nothing to do with us.

1822
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:57,790
I just... I took her at her word.

1823
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:01,790
She has a punctured lung, ruptured spleen and a fractured jaw.

1824
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:04,040
So don't send an Edible Arrangement.

1825
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,450
How many times? How many times I got to do it?

1826
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,000
How many times I got to say I'm sorry?

1827
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,330
I don't know. You haven't said it one time.

1828
01:39:14,410 --> 01:39:15,500
Ah, you're so full of shit.

1829
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:18,330
All this is about is about the goddamn kid in the picture, right?

1830
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,540
You think he's like you.

1831
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,580
Yes. He's alone in Juárez. 

1832
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:22,660
- Do you even care? Do you... - How do you know that?

1833
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,200
How do you know he's like you?

1834
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:25,620
You are so weird, Chris.

1835
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,200
You get these ideas in your head, 

1836
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:28,620
and you just obsess...

1837
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:30,540
Goddamn it, you know how exhausting it is?

1838
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:32,080
My entire life, I've had to clean up

1839
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,040
after the weird kid, you know that?

1840
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,040
I'm not weird.

1841
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:34,830
Oh, you're not weird?

1842
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:36,450
Every fucking time we move, 

1843
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:39,160
we go to a new town. What happens? Then you show up with your fits.

1844
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:41,160
- I don't do that anymore, Braxton. - Your rocking. Your stupid 

1845
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:42,290
Solomon Grundy bullshit.

1846
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:43,700
Then I got to beat somebody's ass 

1847
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:44,870
'cause they put their hands on you.

1848
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:46,540
No. You like to fight!

1849
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:48,200
Ah, it ain't the goddamn point!

1850
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:49,080
The point is 

1851
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,250
I always get your fucking back, Chris! - Goodbye.

1852
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:53,200
I get your back. You ever say thank you? 

1853
01:39:53,290 --> 01:39:54,830
"Wow. Gee, thanks, Brax.

1854
01:39:54,910 --> 01:39:56,910
Thank you for getting my back. Thank you. 

1855
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,580
You are the best goddamn brother..."

1856
01:39:58,660 --> 01:39:59,700
What are you doing? You...

1857
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:00,870
Goddamn it! 

1858
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:02,040
What, you just gonna leave?

1859
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:04,290
Fuck. You know what? You want to go to Juárez?

1860
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:06,330
Hey, let's go to Juárez.

1861
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,370
Good for you. Let's go get our asses shot off.

1863
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,330
My drone's not responding.

1864
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:48,910
I lost the feed.

1866
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:05,250
Get 'em on. Get 'em on.

1869
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:10,910
Load 'em up, load 'em up. All the way to the back. Fill it up. 

1870
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,620
Vámonos.

1871
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:15,540
Field trip. Follow them. Get on the bus. Get 'em on.

1872
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:16,580
Let's go! 

1873
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:21,330
Everybody out! Field trip! Get 'em on the bus!

1876
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:44,790
You found it?

1878
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:46,250
We found it.

1879
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:47,540
How far?

1880
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:49,410
11 minutes.

1881
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:50,290
Okay.

1882
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:52,040
We'll wait till dark, and then we'll go in.

1883
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,160
Can you kill the lights?

1884
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,750
Yes, but it won't matter.

1885
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:56,000
Why not?

1886
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,450
The children will be dead before it's dark.

1887
01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:59,250
Braxton.

1888
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:00,120
Yeah.

1889
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,950
Thank you.

1890
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:10,660
Get 'em all out!

1891
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,950
Hey, all the kids on the bus! Field trip!

1892
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,540
Rápido.

1893
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,080
- ?Qué me ven, cabrones? - Get 'em all out!

1894
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,080
- Muévanse. Ey, ey. - Let's go!

1895
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:18,410
Rápido.

1902
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:57,290
Hey! Move on them!

1903
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:59,540
Hold it down! I'll be right back!

1904
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:32,160
Where you at, kid?

1905
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:35,830
Where the fuck are you?

1906
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:05,700
Hey, kid, where you at?

1907
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:08,620
What are you doing?

1908
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:11,120
The fuck do you think you're doing? You trying to get me killed? Get up! 

1909
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,910
We're moving. Come on. This way, this way. 

1910
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,000
Go.

1911
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:22,500
Fire back! Get down, you dumb motherfucker!

1913
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:25,080
Start the bus!

1915
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:27,700
Go!

1918
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:21,000
Fire, Chris! Go, go!

1920
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:54,700
Move, move, move, move, move! Move!

1922
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:41,120
- You're hit? - I'm good. Hey, hey, hey, hey. 

1923
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,330
I'm good. Go.

1924
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,410
- I'm fine, go. I'm fine. Hey, stop. - No. You're hit.

1925
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:49,080
Finish the fucking job. I-I got these motherfuckers. Just go!

1926
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:51,790
Go, Chris. Go get to those kids! Go! Damn it.

1929
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:51,700
Now, wait.

1931
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,000
Wait.

1932
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:12,330
Let's go.

1934
01:50:40,910 --> 01:50:42,200
I need to seal it.

1935
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:53,160
Open up! Help them off the bus.

1937
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:58,250
Get off the bus. Let's get this over with.

1938
01:50:58,330 --> 01:51:00,120
Come on. Move. Hey.

1939
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:01,950
?ándale!

1941
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:05,870
Get in the fucking hole!

1942
01:51:06,290 --> 01:51:08,790
Get in the hole now! Hurry up!

1943
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:12,450
Move! Move! Follow the person in front of you.

1944
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:13,660
Go!

1946
01:51:22,330 --> 01:51:24,330
Come on. Follow them. Follow them.

1949
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:32,080
Go. Hurry up.

1951
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:52,620
Move!

1953
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:15,160
You again? You again? Hey, get up.

1954
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:20,250
Hey, back up. Back the fuck up!

1955
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:21,790
Solomon Grundy,

1956
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:23,290
- born on a Monday. - Hey, I got a heavy figure!

1957
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:24,540
Christened on Tuesday.

1958
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:26,000
- I'm not the guy you want. - Married on Wednesday.

1959
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,450
- Burke is the guy you want. - Sick on Thursday.

1960
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:28,410
- Worse on Friday. - Listen to me, man!

1961
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,830
Died on Saturday.

1962
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:31,080
- Listen to me! - Buried on Sunday.

1963
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:32,540
Burke is the guy...

1964
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,040
That was the end of Solomon Grundy.

1965
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:45,120
Alberto Sanchez?

1966
01:52:51,370 --> 01:52:52,450
It's okay.

1967
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:55,160
It's okay.

1968
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:58,120
Estás bien.

1969
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,660
Estás seguro. Estás bien.

1970
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:30,200
You're safe.

1971
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,790
It's okay.

1972
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:43,040
Estás a salvo.

1973
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:58,200
Let's go, yeah?

1974
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,620
Vámonos.

1975
01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:10,080
It's okay.

1976
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:13,200
Just go... go over to the bus, yeah?

1977
01:54:13,450 --> 01:54:14,700
Let's go. It's okay.

1980
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:31,660
Who's that?

1981
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,200
Hey, Chris, stop the bus.

1982
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:35,000
- What? - Stop the bus, man. Just...

1983
01:54:36,450 --> 01:54:37,450
Open the door.

1984
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,410
Open the door, ding-dong.

1985
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:48,660
Hello.

1986
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,120
Hi.

1987
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,540
Come here.

1988
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,700
Hey.

1989
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:05,410
Hi. Who are you?

1990
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,120
Hi.

1991
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:10,620
Chris.

1992
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:13,660
She likes me, man.

1993
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:18,410
You want to... You want to come home with me?

1994
01:55:18,910 --> 01:55:20,040
Chris.

1995
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,330
Hey.

1996
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:25,080
Hey.

1997
01:55:25,450 --> 01:55:26,450
Look at her.

1998
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:29,910
Yeah. Are you gonna be mine?

1999
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:32,160
As I suspected.

2000
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:35,120
What do you think, man? What should I call her?

2001
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:37,580
That's a...

2002
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:39,160
That's a male

2003
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:40,540
cat.

2005
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:59,700
Da.

2006
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,790
Batu Donetsk,

2007
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,790
owner of the largest kill squad in Europe?

2008
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,450
I'm sorry.

2009
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:12,120
You have me confused with someone else.

2010
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:13,750
52 years old.

2011
01:56:14,290 --> 01:56:16,450
Born in Nizhny Novgorod.

2012
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:19,500
Russian, Romanian, Mongol descent.

2013
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,870
Seven years in the prison known as the Black Dolphin.

2014
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:24,580
Married four times.

2015
01:56:24,790 --> 01:56:26,580
One child by a mistress.

2016
01:56:27,910 --> 01:56:30,660
Would you like me to tell you the mileage on your Bentley?

2017
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:33,200
What can I do for you?

2018
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:36,580
Terminate the contract on Marybeth Medina.

2019
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:39,660
Why would I do that?

2020
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:42,250
Let me tell you a story.

2023
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,910
Ice cream...

2029
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:11,040
Speak.

2030
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:14,080
Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica.

2031
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:16,950
Write it down.

2033
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,250
How about you do your fucking job

2034
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:25,080
and stick to the contract?

2035
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:27,660
You said the contract would stay in place

2036
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:29,620
until that Treasury bitch was dead.

2037
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:33,080
Or until you expired. Correct?

2038
01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:35,290
Well, I am very much alive.

2039
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:37,120
Consider it done.

2040
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:40,080
Good. When?

2041
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:42,370
Momentarily, sir.

2042
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:44,950
Goodbye.

2043
01:58:48,410 --> 01:58:49,660
What?

2045
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:21,950
Thanks.

2046
01:59:23,330 --> 01:59:24,750
Gentlemen. How are you?

2047
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:27,000
Nice to see you.

2048
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:28,410
Deputy Director. You doing okay?

2049
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:29,750
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

2052
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:30,540
Harbor Neuroscience Academy.

2053
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,540
This is Deputy Director Medina, U.S. Treasury.

2054
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:36,830
Ma'am, I don't think you're calling who you think you are.

2055
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:38,950
I think I am.

2056
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:41,160
I know you can hear me.

2057
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:43,790
And I just wanted to say thank you.

2058
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:46,620
Ray found Edith, but you and Chris helped me

2059
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:48,660
solve the rest of the puzzle.

2060
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:51,370
Ray would be grateful.

2061
02:00:52,290 --> 02:00:53,450
And so am I.

2062
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,000
Is that good, Aidan?

2063
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:58,040
Uh, yeah, it looks good.

2064
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:58,950
Awesome.

2065
02:00:59,370 --> 02:01:01,080
Oh, she's here. Come on. Let's go, Miles.

2066
02:01:01,410 --> 02:01:02,580
- Going. Let's go. - Going now?

2067
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:03,410
Hold on.

2068
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:04,290
Yeah.

2071
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:07,790
Kid's unbelievable.

2072
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:09,040
Braxton.

2073
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:10,790
It's-it's-it's... It's wildly unfair.

2074
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:11,750
He's a child, Braxton.

2075
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:14,120
I don't care he's a child. I'm a man. You're a man.

2076
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:16,290
He's a kid. That's a cat. Who cares?

2077
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:18,200
The point is we're supposed to be taking turns.

2078
02:02:18,330 --> 02:02:21,040
He's been holding my cat for the last hour and a half, Chris.

2079
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:22,450
So when's it my turn?

2080
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:24,290
How much longer, man?

2081
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:27,290
Alberto. ?Cuánto falta hasta Harbor?

2082
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:29,910
Mil doscientas cuarenta y siete millas.

2083
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,700
Oh, Jesus.

2084
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:32,120
Uh, 1,247 miles.

2085
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,160
It's amazing. It's amazing how he can just come up with that

2086
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:34,950
but he can't figure out how long it takes

2087
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,450
to give somebody else a turn holding the damn cat.

2088
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,330
He's like a freaking genius.

2089
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:43,870
Just, um, out of idle curiosity,

2090
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:47,370
what are your plans after, uh... after we drop Alberto at Harbor?

2091
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:48,830
My plans?

2092
02:02:50,950 --> 02:02:51,700
I-I don't know.

2093
02:02:51,790 --> 02:02:53,000
Do you think, um...

2094
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:56,370
Well, I made a reservation at an RV park, uh,

2095
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:58,160
at the Chattahoochee for after we drop off Alberto,

2096
02:02:58,290 --> 02:03:00,080
a-and I thought we could go hiking there.

2097
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,870
You-you made a reservation?

2098
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:06,330
It's just an idea.

2099
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:10,370
And-and what, we'd... we-we'd stay in the Airstream?

2100
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,410
I think it'll be fun.

2101
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:17,250
I think it... I think it might be fun, too.
