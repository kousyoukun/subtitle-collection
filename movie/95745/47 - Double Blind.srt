To continue with our story, these participants are randomly assigned to either

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:08,946
the control group, where they take the placebo pill, or the experimental group,

3
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:13,414
where they take the active pill. They take the pill at the same time of day, on

4
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:17,634
the same day, and the same place. And then, they all go to bed in a sleep lab at

5
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:22,545
the same time. While sleeping, researchers observe the particpant's sleep

6
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:27,680
patterns and rate their quality of sleep. Do you think these researchers should

7
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:32,604
or should not know which treatment participants received? Why or why not? Yes,

8
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:37,945
because their ratings will depend on which treatment the people received. No, to

9
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:43,190
help maintain participant confidentiality. Yes, because the researchers ratings

10
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:47,955
will be more accurate. Or no, because if they know, their judgements may be

11
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:47,967
biased. What do you think?
