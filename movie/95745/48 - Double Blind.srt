1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,010
In this case, it's better if researchers do not know which treatment the

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:08,605
participants received. This is called a double blind experiment, because neither

3
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:12,906
the participants nor the researchers studying them know which treatment they

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:17,013
received. Single blind is when only the participants are unaware of their

5
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,556
treatment condition. And the reason this experiment is double blind is because

6
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:25,973
if the researcher knows which treatment each person received, that may impact

7
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:30,316
their judgements on how well the active pill works versus the Placebo. It may

8
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:34,522
subconsciously cause the researchers to think that the people who took the

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,827
active pill are sleeping better, and this might consciously or unconsciously

10
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,266
alter their measurements.
