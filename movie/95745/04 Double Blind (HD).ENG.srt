Sorry.

165
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,564
Mr. Carlton, Ria Torres
is very thorough.

166
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,666
And she doesn't work for
you, she works for me.

167
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,569
Those thieves knew exactly
where the new exhibit is being stored.

168
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,404
They were shot
6 feet from it.

169
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,406
Now, somebody at the museum
tipped them off.

170
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,909
She interviewed
everyone there.

171
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,410
Except you.

172
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,930
What, are you suggesting
what I think you're suggesting?

173
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,634
What'd you find out?

174
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,019
I already told you,

175
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,688
the man died before Dr. Lightman could
get much out of him.

176
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,390
Wait, not even what
they were there to steal?

177
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:53,058
Well, my guess
would be art.

178
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,760
The opening is this Friday.

179
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,762
A black tie gala
fundraiser.

180
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,531
Now, I need to know
there is no danger of a second attempt.

181
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:21,418
Hey.

182
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,859
I was just gonna check
if you're ok.

188
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,648
I feel terrible
for your loss.

189
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:50,017
I was gonna offer
to buy you a cup of coffee.

Ok.

194

For the record,
this isn't how we first met.

195
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:09,070
If anyone asks,
we met online.

196

Someone's feeling
better.

197
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:13,257
Can I ask how close
a relative that was?

198
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:16,961
Well, it depends
what you mean by close.

199
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:18,913
Is it possible,
just a little bit,

200
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:21,466
that you're playing
the grief card with me?

201
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,468
I resent that.

202
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,253
Is it working?

Pleased to meet you,

Call me Lightman.

207
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:39,417
And pleased to meet me,
that's an understatement,
that is.

208
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:42,937
When I beat the other guy
to the seat next to you,

209
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,156
you were relieved.
Who was he?

210

Come on, I saw
that look in your eyes.

clue me in?

I was in the middle

What woman?

227
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:48,168
Interesting personality.

anything odd

234
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:03,868
about the janitor
who was mopping up
at the hospital?

The museum repaints
before every new exhibit,

239
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,796
and they always use
the same guys.

mentioned that.

The monarch and the viceroy.
Did you look them up?

Oh, yeah. Yeah,
they're nearly identical.

A predator can't tell
the difference between them.

All he knows is
one of them's toxic,

both alone.

but never gets in the car.

327
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,345
The curator?

328
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,864
Sidney Carlton.

329
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,205
Hey, where's Lightman?

330
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:16,758
Um, not here.

331
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,343
You should try
his office.

332
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:20,044
What?

333
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:22,546
What are you hiding?

334
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:28,269
He had me put
a hidden camera

335
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:30,521
on those 2 painters
in the lobby.

336
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:32,390
He wanted to see what they did when
no one was watching.

337
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:34,909
You guys used me
as a decoy?

338
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:36,944
He planted a catalogue
of the upcoming museum exhibit

339
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:38,396
on the coffee table.

340
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:41,199
I thought he wanted you
out of the lab.

341
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,284
Just watch, ok?

342
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:47,672
Because, like, you can't
see what I can see.

343
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,559
See how he flips
through the pages like
he couldn't care less?

344
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:54,812
Like he's looking through
an issue of "cat lover."

345
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,930
Ahem.

346
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,266
You're a cat lover?

347
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:00,968
And I had you down
for a poodle.

348
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,522
But your other painter...

349
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:06,974
He's taking
his time,

350

the images.

He doesn't need
to see it again.

356
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:25,493
He's interested
in something on that page.

357
00:19:25,577 --> 00:19:27,879
And they're going to
go back for it.

358

He's your inside man.

I should be fired?

An Egyptian statue of Osiris
and an emerald from India.

361
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,125
So what,
in your opinion,

362
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:42,443
is the most
important piece

363
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,512
in this new exhibit?

364
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,848
Well, the statue of Osiris
without a doubt.

365
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:49,984
Why pay cash for
a town car you never
actually use?

366

What's the money for?
Catnip?

367

You're divorced,
you have a teenage
daughter,

00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:05,166
and you cook.

Well, call me Mr. right.

But enough about me.

up to your place?

the bad housekeeping,

That's the third time

Maybe I wasn't
talking about food.

This is like a therapy session in
the middle of a police interrogation.

That's my idea
of foreplay.

Well, when I'm getting
to know a man,

I like to put
my best foot forward.

You're not letting me.

You're not listening.

And the rest.

393
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:24,912
Don't call it foreplay
if you don't mean it.

Ahem.

you're special, love.

You already know it.

Mr. Carlton, do you have
a drug problem?

399

But you have it
under control.

400
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:56,194
So what the painter saw
was you paying your dealing.

401
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,595
And you know
he saw you,

402
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,030
which is why you failed
to mention him

403
00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:01,482
when I was screening
your staff.

404
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,117
What's this got to do
with the attempted robbery?

405
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:05,653
The thief,
before he died,

406
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:08,823
said there was already
a buy for something in the collection.

407
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:12,376
I bet that statue
buys a whole lot of drugs.

408
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:13,777
Now wait a minute.

409
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:17,265
Even if I was a thief,
I wouldn't steal from my own museum.

00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:20,301
This exhibit is
a game changer for me.

Now, focus on
