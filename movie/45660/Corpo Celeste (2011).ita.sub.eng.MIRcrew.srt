1
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,847
That's the overpass.
We've arrived. Let's wait here.

2
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,724
- Are you sure?
- I'd say so.

3
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,029
Now what do we do?

4
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,998
Let's pray-

5
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,275
<i>In the coming election,
vote Beniamino Spano,</i>

6
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,612
<i>the force of the future...</i>

7
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,457
- Hi, Daddy.
- Daddy's love, hi.

8
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,331
Debby, aren't you cold?
Here's your jacket.

9
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,798
Come and get your jacket.

10
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,604
Come here, sweetheart.

11
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,836
Where are you going?

12
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,679
Marta!

13
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,744
Put it down!
He'll tell us when!

14
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,712
Girls, stay in line.

15
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,447
Santa!

16
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,016
Everything okay?

17
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,753
They'll drive me crazy.

18
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,586
Debby, you're here!

19
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,164
I want you to meet my nieces.
They're back from Switzerland.

20
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,530
- Did you know that?
- No.

21
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,130
We're a little messy.
We walked all night.

22
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,503
You did the night pilgrimage?

23
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,739
Rosa and Alfredo, her boyfriend.

24
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,575
- He's from here.
- A pleasure. I'm Santa.

25
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,519
And the younger one, Marta.

26
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,580
Where is she?

27
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,289
Marta!

28
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,221
Here she is.

29
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:45,319
Hi, beautiful.
How old are you?

30
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,627
- Nearly 13.
- Really? You'd never guess.

31
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:52,325
You know,
with the kids your age, I...

32
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,462
Santa, come here!

33
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,504
Excuse me.

34
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,598
The loudspeaker's not working.

35
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,071
- It worked a moment ago.
- Well, it doesn't now.

36
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,771
I meant to tell you
it doesn't work sometimes.

37
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,475
Let's get things going!

38
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,652
Reverend, could we spread a tarp
in case it rains?

39
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,148
Okay, spread a tarp!

40
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,851
A tarp.
Let's cover the Virgin.

41
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,793
Testing, testing...

42
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,507
It's working.

43
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,274
<i>Dear brothers and sisters,
your attention, please.</i>

44
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:40,343
<i>We're gathered here,
like every year, to renew our faith</i>

45
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,246
<i>and the love for our community.</i>

46
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,378
<i>This year is special though.</i>

47
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,958
<i>In fact, Bishop Giorgio
will take part in our procession.</i>

48
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,599
<i>They tell me His Excellency's car
is about to arrive.</i>

49
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,902
<i>Let's wait for him in silence</i>

50
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,945
<i>and welcome him
with all the warmth and joy</i>

51
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,945
<i>our community can offer.</i>

52
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,233
It's an order!

53
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,780
Open the door!

54
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,860
Marta!

55
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,198
Let me in!

56
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,759
- What time is it?
- Relax. Your mother's sleeping.

57
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,028
You're uglier than before.

58
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,143
- Welcome.
- Hello.

59
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,648
You're late.
They're waiting.

60
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,776
Know where to go?

61
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,813
I'll accompany you.

62
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,931
You can get there
through the rear door too,

63
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:28,165
but I suggest you come this way
to say hello to Jesus first of all.

64
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,516
Children, who makes up the Church?

65
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:45,146
The Pope and priests, non-Europeans,
the people of God or the plant world?

66
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,389
Come on, the p...

67
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,062
Sara.

68
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,225
The p...

69
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,001
The Pope and priests.

70
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,669
Are you sure?
Is that your final answer?

71
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,445
That's my final answer.

72
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,584
- Tell her, Anna.
- The people of God.

73
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,447
Good for you!

74
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,856
Kids, more energy!

75
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:28,226
What's the name of Lazzaro's sister
who listens to Jesus attentively?

76
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,129
Mary, Martha, Sabrina or Jessica?

77
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,804
Want to answer, my dear Marta?

78
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,675
Don't be scared. Listen...

79
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,875
Mary,

80
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,243
Martha, Sabrina or Jessica?

81
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,846
Come on, a name you know very well.

82
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,919
Martha?

83
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:01,688
Mary, the good sister is Mary.
Tell her!

84
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,858
Go take a seat.

85
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,901
Did you go to catechism
where you lived before?

86
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,804
Sit here, next to Anna who's good.

87
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,071
What did they teach you there?
Did you take tests?

88
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,979
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- No.

89
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,656
So, we were saying
that Confirmation confirms,

90
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:31,388
meaning it's the final confirmation
of Christian values.

91
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,654
It's a guarantee, a security.

92
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,301
Without Confirmation,
the doors to Paradise are closed

93
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,768
and Matrimony too.

94
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,608
With a small reading,
you'll understand better.

95
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,672
You have to memorize this.
It's the formula of the Holy Ghost.

96
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,714
Natale, stop clowning around!

97
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:58,980
Now pay attention and listen
to what Marco reads to us.

98
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,054
Read it.

99
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,653
"You are growing and
it's an amazing experience for you.

100
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,092
How many new things each day:

101
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,326
your voice changes,
your body transforms."

102
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,232
It transforms...

103
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,927
It transforms...

104
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,968
"You feel useless, bored, depressed.

105
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,576
You don't know
your place in the world.

106
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,576
But we know.

107
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,875
The Church is the answer
you're looking for."

108
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,778
- The Church...
- The Church...

109
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:32,322
"Feeling the Holy Ghost is like
wearing wonderful sunglasses

110
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:37,051
that allow you to see things
in a different way.

111
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,625
It is through the Holy Ghost
that you must see the world."

112
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,163
See the world...

113
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,094
See the world...

114
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,969
It's hard to feel at home.

115
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,069
How long were you in Switzerland?
Ten or eleven years?

116
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,779
Ten years.

117
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,709
Pass me your plates.

118
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,945
Take it off.
You'll stain it with tomato!

119
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,919
Leave me alone!

120
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,786
Holy Mother,
I can't get that dress off her.

121
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,122
You know kids.
They like to wear costumes.

122
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,992
- She's not eating?
- Tell her. She won't listen to me.

123
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,765
Stuffed calamari.
Thanks, Aunt!

124
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,201
- I don't know if they're good.
- You always say that.

125
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,235
It's from the ocean.

126
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,471
I'm not buying
Mediterranean fish anymore.

127
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,817
- Why? Isn't it fresh?
- You never know what you're eating.

128
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,352
With all the corpses in the sea,
they choke...

129
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,055
Nina's cousin in the navy told us.

130
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,421
All the bodies they find!
They're aliens.

131
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,186
No, they're Moroccans.

132
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,193
What should the fish eat?

133
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,925
It's best to buy ocean fish.

134
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,729
That's enough gloom.
A toast.

135
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,071
It may be thanks to God,
or maybe to the sea,

136
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,940
a toast I make,
to these calamari.

137
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,206
To the new house!

138
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,611
- Me too!
- Just a drop.

139
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:21,795
- How did you prepare them?
- Bread crumbs, parsley, garlic...

140
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,833
ls Mom your garbage can?

141
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,236
- Mom likes them.
- Yes, they're excellent.

142
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,601
Then take them from the pan.
Don't eat her leftovers!

143
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,607
I didn't touch it.

144
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,850
Louder! Let us hear!

145
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,598
Wonderful!

146
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,108
You should have seen her
in church. Fantastic!

147
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,008
Debby, what's the church one like?

148
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,087
- Good!
- Come to Daddy!

149
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,521
- Is our Marta ready for Confirmation?
- Yes.

150
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,757
She was already attending
Sunday School in Switzerland.

151
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,664
Here she's just started catechism.
Father Mario insisted.

152
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,329
He was right to insist!

153
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,231
It's also a way to make friends.

154
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,743
It's better to do it now and get it over with.

155
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,907
- Isn't Marta's cake beautiful!
- Happy birthday, Rosa.

156
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,050
Happy birthday, Rosetta dear.

157
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,052
- Did Marta make it?
- Yes, by herself.

158
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,141
- Who wants some?
- Me!

159
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,608
You, Uncle?

160
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,844
No thanks. I'm really full.

161
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,477
I'm stuffed too.

162
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,093
Let's taste it!

163
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,276
Delicious!

164
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,513
You don't know what you're missing.

165
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:03,922
I just eat and eat
and leave no room for dessert.

166
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,054
- Is that my bra?
- Rosa, not now...

167
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,929
- If she takes my stuff, she should tell me.
- Don't argue. It's your birthday.

168
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,233
What's she need a bra for?
Look at her! She's a child!

169
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,065
Stop!

170
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,998
She runs off!

171
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,408
Where's she going?
She doesn't accept criticism.

172
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,606
It's easy just to run off!

173
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,815
"Holy Ghost, in times of trouble
I seek you and call you.

174
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,828
Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani.

175
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,423
Like water flowing
from the font of the sea,

176
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,394
I entrust myself to you.

177
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,269
Free me from
the temptations of the world.

178
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,235
Give me wisdom, intellect,

179
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,103
counsel, fortitude, knowledge,

180
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,577
mercy, fear of God."

181
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,607
Holy Ghost,

182
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,711
in times of trouble
I seek you and call you.

183
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,320
Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani.

184
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,033
Give me...

185
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,369
mercy, intellect,

186
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,409
counsel, fortitude,

187
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,070
knowledge...

188
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,846
Fear of God!

189
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,912
- Is he totally naked?
- Yes.

190
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:55,385
- Life-size?
- Yes.

191
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,457
Even down there?

192
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,188
Children, you don't understand.

193
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:04,290
Jesus' body is different from ours.

194
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,767
It's a spiritual body,
heavenly, holy.

195
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,428
Can I go to the bathroom?

196
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,768
Jasmine, especially you,
listen to me.

197
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,174
It's a figurative crucifix,

198
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,747
meaning you see
the whole figure of Jesus.

199
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,318
- When will they bring it?
- The day of Confirmation.

200
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,125
On a donkey!

201
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,627
It's Father Mario's idea,
our reverend parish priest.

202
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:38,632
He wants to organize
a grandiose ceremony

203
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,670
for when this gift is unveiled.

204
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:49,902
<i>I'm tuning into God</i>

205
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:54,507
<i>He's the right frequency...</i>

206
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,682
- Have you seen lgnazio?
- No, I'm sorry.

207
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,261
- Thank you.
- Father Mario, excuse me...

208
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,399
Wouldn't you like to hear
the children's Confirmation song?

209
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,999
Yes.

210
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,870
Children, keep the tempo.

211
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:28,274
<i>I'm tuning into God</i>

212
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:32,685
<i>He's the right frequency</i>

213
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:38,086
<i>I'm the one tuning in</i>

214
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,222
<i>He's a goal for me</i>

215
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,465
<i>I want to choose Jesus...</i>

216
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:06,453
<i>I listen to His voice</i>

217
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:11,558
<i>I listen to His command</i>

218
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:16,656
He teaches me so much

219
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:21,829
<i>He teaches me what I'm worth</i>

220
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:26,967
<i>I want to choose Jesus...</i>

221
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:24,027
<i>March elections are, for Calabria,
a testing ground...</i>

222
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,202
What treatment!

223
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,676
Go to bed.

224
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,454
No, I'm fine here.

225
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,895
I dreamed my teeth were falling out.

226
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,897
Bad sign, right?

227
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,967
Pretty much.

228
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,010
Come here.

229
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,755
Are your Confirmation classmates nice?

230
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,759
Normal.

231
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,022
That's good.

232
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,222
- What?
- They're not abnormal.

233
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,302
- What do you do?
- We sing.

234
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,269
Let me hear.

235
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,533
- I don't remember.
- Come on, a little bit!

236
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,713
- No, come on...
- Are you shy?

237
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,273
You're shy!

238
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,278
Come on, a little bit for your mom
who has to go to work.

239
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,950
Okay, but close your eyes.

240
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,958
Really close them!

241
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:47,904
<i>I want to choose Jesus...</i>

242
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,051
Oh, God.

243
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,889
Why are you so selfish?

244
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,827
Let Mom sleep!

245
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,792
You sleep at night, don't you?

246
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,365
Rosetta, I can defend myself.

247
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,701
That's not true!

248
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:19,105
You don't realize
she's devouring all your energy.

249
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,103
She's sucking up
all you have left inside.

250
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,673
What are you saying?

251
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,616
These are your Confirmation clothes.

252
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,456
They're my boyfriend's sister's.

253
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:40,527
They have to be returned intact.

254
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,832
You're welcome!

255
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,992
- Rita, where've you been?
- Sorry, the girls...

256
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,222
It's okay now.
The dough's rising over!

257
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,529
Help him out.

258
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,655
It was Jesus' very hands

259
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,731
that revealed his holiness to people.

260
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:53,492
Placing His hands,
the Savior performed His first miracles,

261
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,968
like this...

262
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,769
Did she freeze?

263
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:10,313
We too can experience
this energy of faith

264
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,545
that flows from our hands.

265
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,855
And we'll do it with a game called

266
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,051
"The dance of the man born blind."

267
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,454
- Who can say who he was?
- Me!

268
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,623
Anna?

269
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,633
The man born blind
was a man who'd never seen,

270
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:29,102
so Jesus Christ gave him sight.

271
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,431
Good!

272
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:34,599
- How did he do that, Jasmine?
- No clue!

273
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,738
- Cinzia?
- With His hands?

274
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,815
- How, Sara?
- He put them on his face.

275
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,886
I'll explain what He did exactly.

276
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:48,217
Jesus used spit,

277
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,717
saliva on His hands,

278
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:56,265
and then He placed them
on the man born blind.

279
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,045
Wait.

280
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,389
Wait.

281
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,622
I remember one.

282
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,629
How's it go?

283
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,792
Jesus, take me in Your hands tonight.
Watch over me till morning light.

284
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,958
Doesn't count.
It's not a prayer.

285
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,596
- What is it?
- A phrase.

286
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,066
They remember
every prayer that exists:

287
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:31,838
the Credo for the Agonizing,
the Credo for the Dying,

288
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,913
the Credo for the Suffering...

289
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,418
Mom?

290
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,248
Get under!

291
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,324
Tell me.

292
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,027
Rest.
Don't get overtired.

293
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,689
I'm going to Alfri's.

294
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,008
I'm a sufferer...

295
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,205
Come on, stop!

296
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,748
That's enough.
Let's sleep.

297
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,510
Come on.
She might be back.

298
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,915
Rest.

299
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,717
Let's sleep.

300
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,333
I pray for the moribund...

301
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,399
That's enough.
Real rest now.

302
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,182
Chips, pastries, cookies, crackers...

303
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,148
Drinks are missing.

304
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:48,019
If we have to buy drinks,
expenses increase.

305
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,786
- Right, Father?
- What?

306
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,762
Sorry if I interrupt this idyll
of drinks and crackers.

307
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,162
We're worse than the kids!

308
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,166
All they think of is clothes.

309
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:03,066
- But who comes back after Confirmation?
- The church is always full.

310
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,163
Of course, there aren't many youths.

311
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,475
But we're always here.

312
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:15,413
If these kids get to Confirmation,
it's no small thing.

313
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,784
They have to study, grow...

314
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:23,620
- Grow, that's the right word!
- I didn't mean anything special...

315
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:29,187
By now the church has become a place
for toddlers, women, old ladies,

316
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,891
people who have nothing to do.

317
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,366
I think you're a pessimist.

318
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,204
Sorry, maybe I didn't say that right.

319
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:41,536
Let's look around and see
what the world offers today:

320
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,705
uncertainty, instability.

321
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,011
The Church has to become
a protagonist again.

322
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,746
It has to propose extraordinary events,

323
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,220
like ours:
a new Confirmation, renewed.

324
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,261
And the crucifix will be
the gift for our community.

325
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,258
It's a figurative crucifix.

326
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:05,926
Right. We have to get this crucifix
and hide it before the Bishop comes.

327
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,967
Sunday morning.

328
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,762
Is that enough time?

329
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,239
It's two or three hours round trip,
but I can't do it any earlier.

330
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,241
He can't do it any earlier.

331
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:20,775
At 3:00, Confirmation, Holy Mass
and presentation of the crucifix...

332
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,008
Cristiano, come here.

333
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,849
At 5:00, the dance of the little virgins.
The girls are ready.

334
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,781
They need a good beating!

335
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,116
Kids have to obey.

336
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,267
Obey in the name of what?

337
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,133
Settle down.

338
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,870
I'll be right back.

339
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:57,477
Where's he getting
this figurative crucifix?

340
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:02,452
It's in an abandoned church
in Father Mario's town.

341
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,696
- What's this exercise called?
- Lining up for God.

342
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,066
When would that be?

343
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,364
For Confirmation. Excellent.

344
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,965
I'm sorry.
I can't before that.

345
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,734
Seventy.

346
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,676
All reliable people.

347
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,373
Don't worry.

348
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:31,315
About the other thing,
tell His Excellency I feel ready

349
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:37,087
and I could give much more
if I were transferred.

350
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,494
- Hear that?
- What?

351
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,630
They're transferring him.

352
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,763
- What's that mean?
- He just said so.

353
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,063
He wants to have a bigger church.

354
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,329
Why?

355
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:54,804
In a more important church,
he might be made bishop.

356
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,639
Good for his career,
even if he doesn't pray well.

357
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,514
"Now, Master, let your servant
go in peace, according to your word.

358
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,592
For my eyes...

359
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:22,926
have seen your salvation, which you
prepared in sight of all the peoples,

360
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,166
a light for revelation
to the Gentiles...

361
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,876
...and glory for your people Israel.

362
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:48,119
In waking save us,
in sleep abandon us not..."

363
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,835
I brought the next few days' meals.

364
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,035
- Is it true you'll be transferred?
- I wish!

365
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,034
What do you mean "I wish?"
And me?

366
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:49,178
Even if they transfer me,
I'll never forget the community.

367
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:53,154
Besides, you should be glad.
I'd be offered great responsibility.

368
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,855
I know that,

369
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,890
but who knows
who they'll send in your place.

370
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,961
Maybe one of those foreign priests.

371
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,904
It's late.
They're waiting for you at home.

372
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,802
No, I brought sheets.
I'll go change the bedding.

373
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,191
- Will you be eating?
- No, thanks.

374
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,747
Look!

375
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,644
It'll fall on your head.

376
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,818
Let's go to the beach!

377
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,556
- Wish I could!
- Come on, please!

378
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,430
- On foot?
- Yes.

379
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,196
- No.
- Come on!

380
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,639
- No.
- I'll get it!

381
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,842
The rent!

382
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,149
May I?

383
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,052
Our Confirmation girl!

384
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:10,684
Here I am!
Excuse me. It's untidy.

385
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,385
You're eating.
I'll come by later?

386
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:17,657
No, no problem.
Our schedule's all off.

387
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,970
This is the rent.

388
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,678
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

389
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,742
How's work?

390
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,922
Fine. At least it's a job.

391
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:45,049
If it weren't for the early hour,
it would be perfect.

392
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,557
Every job has its defects.

393
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:51,963
Mine's a job too,
but my task is much greater.

394
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:56,664
I have to protect you,
act in the parishioners' interest.

395
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,672
That's why I need to know
if I can count on you, on your family.

396
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,179
This isn't a good period.

397
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,683
There are so many bad types around.

398
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,678
- The elections.
- Of course.

399
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,186
What am I supposed to do?

400
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,290
You should put a signature here,

401
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,462
name and surname.

402
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,631
Ventura...

403
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,774
Ventura Rita.

404
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,907
Here?

405
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,577
- Your other daughter?
- Rosa?

406
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,546
- Is she over eighteen?
- Yes, just barely.

407
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,121
- Rosetta!
- What is it?

408
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,925
Come here.

409
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,795
- I have to study.
- Sign here.

410
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,872
Name and surname.

411
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,304
You'll be voting
at the grade school in Via Manzoni,

412
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,608
voting station B.

413
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,873
I think so.

414
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,946
This is the candidate to vote for.

415
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,316
For you too.

416
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,446
- Madame Agata, good evening.
- Evening, Father.

417
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,574
- Everything all right?
- Yes, please come in.

418
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,686
Did you resolve that problem?

419
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,524
Sara, start from further back.

420
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,088
Far enough. Come forward.

421
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,158
Stand straight.

422
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,395
You're going towards God.

423
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,506
Kids...

424
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,708
Confirmation is your spiritual battle.

425
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,507
You are now soldiers of Christ.

426
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:23,745
You all look like mummies!
Come on. Come forward.

427
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,515
Stop. The formula.

428
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,827
Holy Ghost, I entrust myself to you.

429
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,259
Eli, Eli...

430
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,524
- Eli, Eli lema sabachthani.
- Good girl!

431
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:42,468
- What's it mean?
- They're God's words, Marta.

432
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,597
- But what do they mean?
- It's not the time.

433
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,642
Sara, continue!

434
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:51,941
I entrust myself to you like water
flowing from the font of the sea.

435
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,244
Free me of every sin.
Forgive me and give me...

436
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,047
Energy, Sara!

437
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,382
Think...

438
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,319
of Rambo.
Do you know him?

439
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,150
Come on!

440
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,662
Continue.

441
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,821
A cat!

442
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,458
Flavia, a cat got in.

443
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,235
Children, catch it.

444
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,267
Natale!

445
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,973
Good, Marta! Catch it.

446
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,275
Like that.

447
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,218
No, kids...

448
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,873
Miss Marta Ventura, come with me.

449
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,258
The formula.

450
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:17,695
Holy Ghost,
in times of trouble I seek you.

451
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,193
Give me the fear of God...

452
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,895
Do you believe
in God the Father, Almighty,

453
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:27,271
Maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible?

454
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,209
I so believe.

455
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:35,042
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
which is the Lord and gives life,

456
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,813
the Holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints,

457
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,354
the forgiveness of sins,

458
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:43,687
the resurrection of the body
and the life everlasting?

459
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,395
I so believe!

460
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,400
This is our faith,

461
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,493
the faith of our church,

462
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:59,665
and we glory to profess it
in Jesus Christ our Lord.

463
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,037
Amen.

464
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,509
At this point, the Bishop
will mark you with a cross

465
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,477
and give you a symbolic slap,
like this!

466
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,241
When I'm big, I want to be a saint,

467
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,939
so they'll all give me gifts.

468
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:19,413
Want a gift?

469
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,142
I'll give you my hair.

470
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,672
Cut it.

471
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:47,672
- I don't know how.
- Try.

472
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,543
Cut it.

473
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,952
Then you can attach it to yours.

474
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:32,754
I can't do it.

475
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,004
Here.

476
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:30,217
- How do I attach it?
- You got your dress dirty!

477
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,446
Where did you... get this?

478
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,423
I don't want to see.

479
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,695
What did you do?

480
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,860
Show-off.

481
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,535
- Let's go to the hairdresser's.
- No, she stays like that.

482
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:56,099
- She wants to be noticed.
- Come on, both of you.

483
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,208
Debby, let's go!

484
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,789
Maybe I'd better not take Confirmation.

485
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:25,064
Don't add more problems, Marta. Please.

486
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,779
Sit up.

487
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,732
You were right to cut it.

488
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,395
It'll grow out stronger.

489
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,206
After Confirmation,
we'll go to the beach.

490
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,446
Beautiful!

491
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,287
Like a bride.
Your hair too...

492
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:21,987
Is it a custom in your country?

493
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:26,394
The big day is here.

494
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,867
Everything has to be perfect.

495
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:32,963
You, go hang this in the hall.

496
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,467
You, take care of the tables.

497
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:40,639
You, spread the rug
and take care of the stage.

498
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:44,241
You, go to the storage room
and get the decorations.

499
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,218
Under the red veil?

500
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,358
No, maybe under there.

501
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,831
Move things!

502
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,448
What did you find?

503
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,736
Oh, yuck!

504
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,111
- What should we do with them?
- Let's take them home.

505
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,908
No way!
We should drown them!

506
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,112
My grandpa put them
in bags and boiled them.

507
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,619
We'll boil you, not the cats!

508
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,213
Put them down.
You'll hurt them.

509
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,223
What's going on?

510
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:01,557
Don't touch them!
They carry disease.

511
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,653
- What disease?
- All sorts...

512
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,063
All of you, leave!

513
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:10,366
You too. Don't touch them.
Come out of here!

514
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:16,601
Gennaro, get me lgnazio!

515
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,580
What are you doing here?

516
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,528
This goes nowhere.

517
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,936
Marta!

518
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,641
Marta, isn't that right?

519
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,875
Is everything all right?

520
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,985
What are you doing here?
You should be getting ready!

521
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:46,940
How did you get here?

522
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,771
I walked.

523
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,478
Santa? No one...

524
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:59,077
Her mother's cell number?

525
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,581
I understand. All right.

526
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:14,166
- Get in the car.
- No, thanks. I'll go on alone.

527
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,498
- Get in the car.
- I was going home.

528
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,367
No one's there.

529
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,912
Can you tell me what you were doing?

530
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,517
Taking a walk.

531
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:34,144
On the highway?

532
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,724
Anyway, I really need a hand.

533
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,772
- Where are we going?
- To a village close by.

534
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,739
The village I was born in.

535
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,644
We're going to get the crucifix.

536
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,251
We're on a mission.

537
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,007
Wait for me in the car.

538
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:46,817
<i>Your participation demonstrates
faith in our community.</i>

539
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,490
Long live Father Mario!

540
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,393
Let's start over.

541
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,300
Music!

542
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:00,774
For the signatures, over here.

543
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:06,072
- They're just a handful.
- There's a flu going around.

544
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,270
Do you understand me when I talk?

545
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:35,275
If I tell you to wait in the car,
there's a reason!

546
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,089
Hello?

547
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,659
Yes, she's with me.

548
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,185
What should I have done?

549
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,628
Go looking?

550
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,699
Yes, I know...

551
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:07,798
I won't get tired.

552
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:13,210
Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani.

553
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,217
- Like to eat something?
- No, thanks.

554
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,980
I thought there would be more people here.
I'm just here for the signatures.

555
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,214
Sure.

556
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,017
A sweet for the little girl?

557
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,627
- A nice bass?
- Fifteen minutes, not more.

558
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,596
Get it ready!

559
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,658
Madame Angela...

560
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:37,602
I don't want to disturb you,
but I'd like a favor.

561
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:41,971
Pray for my sister.
She has a disease that won't go away.

562
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,442
I'm praying so hard.

563
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:48,345
- If you could pray for her too...
- Of course.

564
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:52,010
This is her picture.
Her name's Caterina.

565
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:53,815
- Mom?
- Just a minute...

566
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,715
Give her a kiss.

567
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,555
I'll pray for your sister.

568
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:05,490
Excuse her. That's how she is,
but she's a great cook.

569
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,828
I know.

570
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,746
- You're not eating?
- I don't eat fish.

571
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,406
Too bad.

572
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:25,678
You know how much calcium it has?

573
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,563
No, stay right here.

574
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:00,814
How did you get dirty?

575
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,181
Miss?

576
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,651
Occupied.

577
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,452
Is everything all right?

578
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,919
Take this.

579
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,097
It's the first time, huh?

580
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:34,306
It's a nice thing,
even though it seems bad.

581
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,877
I need the bathroom.

582
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,680
Go where you want.
There's not a soul here.

583
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:25,587
I'll wait for you in the church.

584
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,435
What are you doing?

585
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,625
I didn't recognize you.

586
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,263
I don't see very well.

587
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,311
I'm taking it away,
to warmth and safety.

588
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,246
Anyway, by now this place...

589
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:05,079
See how you let it get ruined?

590
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,086
Hello?

591
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,625
- How are you?
- Fine.

592
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:20,864
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I'm late. I need to call.

593
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,585
Are you a priest?

594
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,492
Yes.

595
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,361
- You study like priests do?
- Yes.

596
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:07,145
What does
"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani" mean?

597
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,012
It's a cry.

598
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,052
It's Jesus crying out,

599
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:22,695
"My God, why have you forsaken me?"

600
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:28,494
- Why is he crying out?
- Because he's angry.

601
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,296
How do you imagine him?

602
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:37,441
Good.

603
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,012
Smiling?

604
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:40,705
Yes.

605
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,575
With blue eyes,

606
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,415
ready to hug you?

607
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,487
Yes.

608
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:52,188
Instead, he's angry, furious.

609
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:56,488
He's alone,
running from one place to another.

610
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,496
Everywhere they ask him
for healing, miracles,

611
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:04,994
and he runs to them all.

612
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,408
With ignorant disciples around him,

613
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,307
who don't understand a thing
and always ask him for explanations.

614
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,884
They don't have a bit of imagination.

615
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,312
And they're scandalized.

616
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,865
Read.

617
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:50,344
"When his family heard this,
they went out to restrain him,

618
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:53,645
for they said:
'He is out of his mind."'

619
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:23,905
He's here.

620
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,019
- Who?
- The Bishop.

621
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,917
Now what do we do?

622
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,150
He shouldn't have waited
till the last minute to get that crucifix.

623
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:34,250
- He had other business.
- What do we do?

624
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:38,727
It makes us look like
a disorganized parish.

625
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,231
- I'd say...
- Let's start with the dance!

626
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,367
Girls, get ready.

627
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:17,814
Marta, let's go.
Come on.

628
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:31,905
Give me a hand.

629
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:29,579
- Hello.
- This is my mother.

630
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,055
Hello.

631
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,119
A pleasure. I'm Santa.

632
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:35,186
And Marta?

633
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,654
Didn't she tell you?

634
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:43,793
Father Mario chose her
for a very important thing.

635
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:48,405
They've gone together
to get the new crucifix.

636
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,875
When?
She didn't tell me anything.

637
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:54,038
I don't know. I'm sorry.

638
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,351
Please, have one.

639
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:11,920
Wouldn't you like to join us?

640
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,830
There is the dance of the little virgins.

641
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,765
We've organized many nice things.

642
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,799
I'll go then. Duty calls.

643
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,879
May I ask a question?

644
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:34,175
Where exactly
will Father Mario be transferred?

645
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,555
Why this bizarre question?

646
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:42,657
Since there's a certain degree
of familiarity between us,

647
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:47,161
he told me he might be transferred
to a more famous parish.

648
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:49,831
Who are you?

649
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,263
Santa.

650
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,672
Yes, but who are you
to our Holy Mother Church?

651
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:59,712
What do you represent?

652
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,821
His Excellency
would like a handkerchief.

653
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,714
I'll see to it right away.

654
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:37,767
- After Confirmation, what else do we do?
- Nothing.

655
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:41,240
We go to church, that's all.

656
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:48,810
- Do you read the Gospel?
- Every day, at mass.

657
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:52,324
You know what they said about Jesus?

658
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:01,628
- What did they say?
- That He was crazy.

659
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,669
Nonsense!

660
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:10,372
Yes, angry, furious.

661
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,782
It's all ready.

662
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,162
So, have you decided?

663
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:18,763
Will you transfer or stay here with us?

664
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,933
Where could I ever go?

665
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,603
There's a stain.

666
01:29:35,837 --> 01:29:37,783
Everything is ready.

667
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:29,124
What a shame.
I was curious to see that crucifix.

668
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:30,668
You know what happened?

669
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:36,208
That girl Marta cut the ropes
and the crucifix fell.

670
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:44,273
Don't bad-mouth my sister.

671
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,680
My brothers and sisters,

672
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:21,483
first of all, I apologize
to the whole community.

673
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:27,186
Today our children

674
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:31,294
become mature.

675
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:37,067
Thanks to our Bishop Giorgio,

676
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,466
who...

677
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:43,067
with his...

678
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:48,542
presence...

679
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:03,572
Wanna see a miracle?

680
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:07,548
Look!

681
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:14,724
It's still alive.
