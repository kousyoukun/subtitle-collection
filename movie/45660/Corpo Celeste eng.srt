1
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:30,205
That's the overpase, we arrived.

2
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:32,198
- Let's wait here?
- Da.

3
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:34,562
- Are you sure?
- I'd say so.

4
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,325
Now what we do?

5
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,204
Let's pray.

6
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,400
< In the coming election
vote Beniamino Spano,

7
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,399
the force of the future...

8
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:59,684
< In the coming election
vote Beniamino Spano!

9
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,640
< Vote Beniamino Spano!

10
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:07,287
< The force of the future!

11
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:10,881
- Hi, Daddy.
< Daddy's little girl, hi!

12
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:14,843
Debby, aren't you cold?
Here's your jacket.

13
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:18,595
< Come and get your jacket.

14
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:20,875
Come here, sweetheart.

15
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:24,202
< Where are you going?

16
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,478
Marta!
Come on.

17
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,480
< Put it down, he'll tell us when.

18
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,317
Girls, stay in line.

19
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:06,443
< Santa!

20
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:08,483
< Everything OK?
- Long live Mary!

21
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,206
They'll drive me crazy.

22
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:13,960
Debby, you're here!

23
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:17,164
I want you to meet my nieces,
they're back from Switzerland.

24
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:20,444
- Did you know that? - No.
- Come on!

25
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,042
We're a little messy,
we walked all night!

26
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:27,085
- You did the night pilgrimage?
- Da.

27
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,239
Rosa and Alfredo, her boyfriend.
He's from here.

28
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,921
A pleasure, Santa.

29
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,963
- How beautiful!
- And the younger one, Marta.

30
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,919
Where is she?

31
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:40,680
- Marta!
- Here she is.

32
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,235
Hi, beautiful.

33
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:46,444
- How old are you?
- Nearly .13

34
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,836
Really? You'd never guess.

35
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,919
You know, with the kids
your age that I teach...

36
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:55,886
< Santa, come here a minute!
- Excuse me.

37
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,242
The loudspeaker's not working.

38
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:01,516
- It worked a moment ago.
- And now it's not.

39
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:05,646
- I wanted to tell you
it doesn't work sometimes.
- Let's get things going!

40
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:10,039
- Reverende, could we spread a tarpaulin
in case it rains?

41
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,277
- OK, spread a tarpaulin.
Quick, a tarpaulin.

42
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:14,756
Let's cover the Virgin.

43
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:18,365
Testing, testing.

44
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,719
It's working.

45
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:33,164
Dear brother and sisters,
your attention please.

46
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:37,957
We're gathered here, like every year,
to renew our faith...

47
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,164
... and the love four our community.

48
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,238
< This year is special, though -.

49
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:47,206
Bishop Giorgio
will take part in our procession.

50
00:05:56,087 --> 00:06:00,365
I here that His Excellency's car
is about to arrive,

51
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,396
let's wait for him in silence
and welcome him...

52
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:08,445
... with warmth and joy, our community
is capable of showing.

53
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:44,283
< Here it is!

54
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,083
< (Rosa) It's an order!

55
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:43,324
< Open it!

56
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,078
< Marta!

57
00:07:57,887 --> 00:07:59,843
< Let me in!

58
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,078
Marta!

59
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:26,046
- What time is it?
- Relax, your mother's sleeping!

60
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,804
You're uglier than before.

61
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:48,959
< Welcome.

62
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,561
- Hello.
- You're late.

63
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:54,559
They're waiting for you.
Do you know where to go?

64
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,718
I'll show you.

65
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:10,360
You can get
through the rear door too...

66
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:14,076
... but I suggest you come this way
to say hello to Jesus first of all.

67
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,121
< Who invented the Church?

68
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:29,917
The Pope and priests, non-Europeans,
the people of God or the plant world?

69
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:34,159
Come on, the p...

70
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,519
The p...

71
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,596
- Sara.
- The p...

72
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:45,246
The p...

73
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,876
- The Pope and priests
- Are you sure, is this your final answer?

74
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:56,885
- That's my final answer.
- Tell her, Anna.

75
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:58,559
The people of God.

76
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,558
Good!

77
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:05,562
< Kids, more energy!
More energy!

78
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:11,601
< What's the name of Lazarus' sister
who listens to Jesus attentively?

79
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:14,565
< Mary, Martha, Sabrina or Jessica?

80
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:20,836
Want to answer, my dear Marta?

81
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,038
Don't be scare, listen...

82
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:28,846
Mary, Martha, Sabrina or Jessica?

83
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:34,876
Come on, a name you know very well.

84
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,842
Martha?

85
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:43,717
Mary, the good sister is Mary,
tell her!

86
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,877
Go and sit down.

87
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:49,959
Did you go to catechism
where you lived before?

88
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:52,277
Don't sit down here.

89
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:55,325
Sit here, next to Anna who's good.

90
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,843
What did they teach you there?
Did you take tests?

91
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,722
< Can I go to the toilet?
< No.

92
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:08,158
So, we were saying that Confirmation...

93
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:12,126
... confirms, meaning it's the final confirmation
of Christian values.

94
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:16,041
< It's guarantee, a certainty.

95
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:19,642
Without Confirmation
the doors to heaven are closed...

96
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:22,321
...and marriage too.

97
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:26,797
After a short reading
you'll understand bearer.

98
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:30,766
You need to learn this by heart,
it's formula of the Holy Ghost.

99
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,759
Natale, stop clowning around!

100
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:38,443
Now pay attention and listen
to what Marco reads to us.

101
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,882
Marco, on you go.

102
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:45,245
< "You are growing and it's
an amazing experience for you."

103
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:47,761
< "How many new things each day:"

104
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:49,917
< "your voice changes,
your body transforms."

105
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:54,000
< It transforms.
- It transforms!

106
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,920
"You feel useless, bored, depressed,"

107
00:12:57,007 --> 00:13:01,159
"you don't know
your place in the world."

108
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,683
- "But we know, the Church
is the answer you're looking for."
- The Church!

109
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:10,558
"Feeling the Holy Ghost is like
wearing wonderful sunglasses,"

110
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:15,243
"that allow you to see things
in a different way."

111
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,524
"It is through the Holy Ghost
that you must see the world."

112
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:22,885
- See the world!
- See the world!

113
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:28,395
< It's hard to feel at home.

114
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:32,400
< How long were you in Switzerland,
ten or eleven years?

115
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:33,966
Ten years.

116
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,561
Can you pass me your plates?

117
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:40,037
Take it off, you'll stain it with sauce!

118
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,083
< Leave me alone!

119
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:47,317
Holy Mother,
I can't get that dress off her.

120
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:50,205
You know kids,
they like to dress up.

121
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,199
< She's not eating?
- Tell her, she won't listen to me.

122
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:57,237
- Voila!
- Stuffed calamari!

123
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:01,036
- Thanks, Aunt!
- I don't know if they're good.
- You always say that!

124
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,280
It's from the ocean.

125
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,757
- I'm not buying Mediterranean fish any more
- Why?

126
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,360
< You never know what you're eating.

127
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:12,041
With all the corpses in the sea...

128
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:14,516
Nino's cousin in the navy told us.

129
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:17,679
All the bodies they find!
They're illegal immigrants.

130
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:22,045
< They're Moroccans.
< What should the fish eat?

131
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,881
< Exactly. It's best to buy ocean fish.
- Come on! - No!

132
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:29,323
That's enough gloom.
A toast.

133
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:33,639
It may be thanks to God,
or maybe to the sea,

134
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,560
a toast I make, to these calamari!

135
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,402
Cheers!
To the new house!

136
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:44,923
- Me too!
- Only for the toast?

137
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,645
Just a drop.

138
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:55,119
- How did you do them?
- Breadcrumbs, parsley, garlic...

139
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,721
Is Mum your bin?

140
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:02,716
- Mum likes calamari.
- Then take them from the pan.

141
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:06,163
- Don't eat her leftovers.
- I didn't touch it.

142
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,237
< Louder, let us here!

143
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:27,886
< Excellent, Debby!

144
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:36,285
Wonderful!

145
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:40,326
- You should have seen her in church, fantastic!
- Debby, what's the church one like?

146
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,284
< Hallelujah.

147
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,756
Hallelujah.

148
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:47,202
Hallelujah! Hallelujah.!

149
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:50,359
< Good!
< Come to Daddy!

150
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:55,684
- Just a drop.
< Is our Martha ready for Confirmation?

151
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:59,999
Yes, she was already attending
Sunday school in Switzerland.

152
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,406
Here she's just started catechism,
Father Mario insisted.

153
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:06,001
He was right to insist!

154
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:09,966
It's a way to make friends too.

155
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:14,484
- You do it now and then forget about it.
< Cake!

156
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,757
< What a beautiful cake!

157
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:22,241
- Thanks.
- Happy Birthday, Rosetta dear.

158
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,804
< Did Marta make it?
< Yes, by herself.

159
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,839
Blow?

160
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,242
- Greetings! Greetings!
- Thanks.

161
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,961
- Who wants some?
- Me!
- No.

162
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:49,403
- You, Uncle?
< No thanks, I'm really full.

163
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:53,366
- I'm stuffed too.

164
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,846
Enough!

165
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,477
Let's taste it!

166
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,798
Mm! Delicious!

167
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:26,921
You don't know what you're missing!
Delicious!

168
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:32,438
< I just eat and eat and leave no room for desert!
- Is that my bra?

169
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:36,076
< Rosa, not now...
- If she takes my stuff, she has to tell me!

170
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,601
Don't argue, it's your birthday.

171
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:43,283
- What's she need a bra for?
Look at her! She's a child
< Stop!

172
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:49,004
-She runs off! Where's she going?
-She doesn't accept criticism.

173
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:50,918
- It's easy just to run off!
< Enough!

174
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:36,997
"Holy Ghost, in times of trouble
I seek you and call you."

175
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:41,159
"Eli, eli, lema sabachthani."

176
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:45,479
"Like water flowing
from the font of the sea,

177
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,842
"I entrust myself to you.

178
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,839
"Free me from
the temptations of the world,

179
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:55,762
"give me wisdom, intellect,
counsel, fortitude,

180
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:58,077
...knowledge, mercy, fear of God.

181
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:06,244
"Holy Ghost, in times of trouble
I seek you and call you.

182
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:12,521
"Eli, eli, lema, sabachthani..

183
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,358
"Give me...

184
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:22,961
"wisdom, intellect,

185
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:25,959
"counsel, fortitude,

186
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,280
"knowledge.

187
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:36,681
"Fear of God."

188
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:09,598
- Is he completely naked?
< Yes. - And how big??

189
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:11,678
Life-size?

190
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:14,042
- Yes, yes...
- Even down there?

191
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:17,756
Children, you don't understand,

192
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:21,237
Jesus' body is different
from ours,

193
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,763
it is a spiritual body,
heavenly, holy.

194
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:28,317
- Can I go to the toilet?
- Jasmine, listen to me.

195
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,637
It's important.

196
00:21:30,727 --> 00:21:34,083
It's a figurative crucifix,

197
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,398
meaning you see
the whole figure of Jesus.

198
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:42,404
- When will they bring it?
- The day of Confirmation.

199
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:44,800
< On a donkey!

200
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:49,561
It's Father Mario's idea,
our reverend parish priest.

201
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:54,163
He wants to organize
a grandiose ceremony...

202
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:58,843
...for when this gift is unveiled.

203
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:05,275
<i>I'm tuning into God.</i>

204
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:09,599
<i>He's the right frequency...</i>

205
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:12,076
<i>I'm tuning...</i>

206
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:17,437
- Have you seen Ignazio?
- No, sorry.

207
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:20,041
- Thank you.
- Father Mario, excuse me!

208
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:24,325
Would you like to hear
the children's Confirmation song?

209
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:29,077
- Yes, OK.
- Thank you.

210
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:32,640
< Children, keep the tempo!

211
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:41,438
<i>I'm tuning into God.</i>

212
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:46,237
<i>He's the right frequency.</i>

213
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:51,447
<i>I'm tuning into God.</i>

214
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:56,317
<i>He's a goal for me.</i>

215
00:22:56,407 --> 00:23:01,003
<i>I want to choose Jesus.</i>

216
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:05,922
<i>I want to choose Jesus.</i>

217
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:10,683
<i>I want to choose Jesus.</i>

218
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:18,443
<i>I listen to His voice.</i>

219
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:23,123
<i>I listen to His command.</i>

220
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:28,244
<i>He teaches me so much.</i>

221
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:32,957
<i>He teaches me what I'm worth.</i>

222
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:38,121
<i>I want to choose Jesus.</i>

223
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:42,439
<i>I want to choose Jesus.</i>

224
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:49,155
< I found something!

225
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:31,443
March elections are, for Calabria,

226
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:33,438
a testing ground...

227
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,403
What treatment!

228
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:24,961
- Go to bed, Mum.
- No, I'm fine here.

229
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:35,922
I dreamed my teeth were falling out.

230
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:40,277
Bad sign, right?

231
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,318
Fairly.

232
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:47,523
Come here.

233
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,683
Are you Confirmation
classmates nice?

234
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,600
- Normal.
- That's good.

235
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,366
- What?
- That they're not abnormal.

236
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:12,246
- What do you do?
- We sing.

237
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:16,398
- Let me here.
- I don't remember.

238
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,318
Come on, a little bit!

239
00:26:18,407 --> 00:26:20,875
- No, come on...
- Are you embarrassed?

240
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:24,003
You're embarrassed.

241
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:28,603
Come on, a little bit for your Mum
who has to go to work.

242
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:34,924
OK, but close your eyes.

243
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:37,884
Really close them!

244
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:50,683
<i>I want to choose Jesus!</i>

245
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:55,646
<i>I want to choose...</i>

246
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:05,397
- Oh, Gad!
< Why are you so selfish?

247
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:10,276
< Let Mum sleep.

248
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:14,838
- You sleep at night, don't you?
- Rosetta, I can defend myself.

249
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:17,838
< That's not true,

250
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,840
you don't realize
she's devouring all your energy.

251
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:26,398
< She's sucking all you have left inside!
< What are you saying?

252
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:35,445
These are your Confirmation clothes,

253
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:37,916
they're Alfri's sister's,

254
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:40,999
they have to be returned intact.

255
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:45,725
You're welcome!

256
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:12,761
- Rita, where've you been?
- Sorry, the girls...

257
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:17,602
It's OK now.
The dough's getting over-risen!
Help him out.

258
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,562
It was Jesus' very hands...

259
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:46,923
... that revealed his holiness to people.

260
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:52,081
Placing His hands,
the Savior performed His first miracles, like this...

261
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:01,403
Has she frozen?

262
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:07,926
We too can experience
this energy of faith...

263
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:12,398
... that issues from our hands.
And we'll do it with a game called

264
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:14,921
"The dance of the man born blind."

265
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:18,204
- Who can say who he was?
< Me! < Me!

266
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:22,405
< Anna?
- The man born blind was a man who'd never seen,

267
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:25,684
so Jesus Christ gave him sight.
-Good.

268
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:30,238
< How did he to that, Jasmine?
< I haven't clue!

269
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:34,238
< Cinzia?
- With His hands?

270
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:36,795
< His hands. How, Sara?
- He put them on his face.

271
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:40,845
I'll explain what He did exactly.

272
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:45,796
Jesus used spit, saliva on His hands...

273
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:51,598
... and then He placed them
on the man born blind.

274
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,244
Wait, I remember one.

275
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,044
< Which?

276
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:06,086
Jesus, take me in Your hands tonight,
watch over me till morning light

277
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:10,046
- Doesn't count, it's not a prayer.
< What is it? - A phrase.

278
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,641
They remember
every prayer that exists:

279
00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:18,196
the Credo for the Agonizing,
the Credo for the Dying,

280
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:22,200
the Credo for the Suffering...
- How wonderful!

281
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,557
< Mum?

282
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:29,845
Get under.

283
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:34,759
- Yes?
< Rest, don't get over-tired.

284
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,315
< I'm going to Alfri's.

285
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:48,686
- I'm a sufferer...
- Come on, stop!

286
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:51,757
Come on, stop!

287
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:55,564
Come on, She might come back!

288
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,478
Let's sleep.

289
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:11,002
- I pray for the moribund...

290
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:13,965
That's enough, real rest now.

291
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,641
Crisps, pastries, cookies, crackers...

292
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:27,082
drinks are missing.

293
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:31,760
If we have to buy drinks,
expenses increase, don't they?

294
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:34,202
< Father Mario?
- What?

295
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:37,723
Sorry if I interrupt this idyll
of drinks and crackers.

296
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:40,480
We're worse than kids!

297
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,159
All they think of is clothes.

298
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,717
- Who comes back after Confirmation?
- Grown-ups.

299
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:47,877
The church is always full.
Of course, there aren't many youngsters.

300
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:51,084
But we're always here.

301
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:57,917
< If these kids get to Confirmation,

302
00:34:58,007 --> 00:35:00,043
< it's no small thing.

303
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:04,325
... They have to study, grow...
- Grow, that's the right word!

304
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:08,685
- I didn't mean anything.
- The church has become a place...

305
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:12,726
... for toddlers, women, old ladies,
people who have nothing to do.

306
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:18,518
- I think you're a pessimist.
- Sorry, maybe I didn't express myself very well.

307
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:22,998
Let's look around and see
what the world offers today:

308
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,840
Uncertainty, instability.

309
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:28,999
< The Church has to become
a protagonist again,

310
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:32,602
< it has to propose
extraordinary events,

311
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:36,202
... like ours,
a new Confirmation, renewed.

312
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:39,836
< And the crucifix will be
the gift for our community.

313
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:44,159
- It's a figurative crucifix.
- Right, we have to get this crucifix...

314
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:46,715
... before the Bishop comes.

315
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:50,846
< Sunday morning.
- Is that time enough?

316
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:54,920
- I can't before that.
- He can't before that.

317
00:35:55,967 --> 00:36:00,324
At 3 Confirmation, Holy Mass
and presentation of the crucifix...

318
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:04,286
- Cristiano, come here.
- At 5, dance of the little virgins...

319
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:09,121
They need good beating!

320
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:11,277
Kids have to obey.

321
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:17,884
Obey in the name of what?

322
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:21,482
Calm down.

323
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,403
I'll be right back.

324
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:35,564
Where's he getting
this figurative crucifix?

325
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:40,402
It's in an abandoned church
in Father Mario's town.

326
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:47,521
- What's this exercise called!
- "Lining up for God".

327
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:50,167
When would it be?

328
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:53,284
For Confirmation, excellent.

329
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:57,406
No, I'm sorry, I can't before that.

330
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,720
< 70, all reliable people,

331
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:04,162
< don't worry.

332
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:08,763
< About the other thing,
tell His Excellency I fell ready...

333
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:13,523
and I could give much more
if I were transferred.

334
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,996
- Hear that?
- What?

335
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:20,558
- They're transferring him.
- What's that mean?

336
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:25,357
- He just said so, he wants to
have a bigger church. - Why?

337
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:28,007
In a more important church...

338
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:31,159
he might be made bishop.

339
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:33,602
< Good for his career,
even if he doesn't pray well.

340
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:46,318
"Now, Master, let your servant
go in peace, according to you word."

341
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:49,841
"For my eyes..."

342
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:55,877
"... have seen your salvation, which you
prepared in sight of all the peoples,"

343
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,322
"a light for revelation to the Gentiles..."

344
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:13,195
"...and glory for your people in Israel."

345
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:19,285
"In waking waking save us,
in sleep abandon us not..."

346
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:31,201
I brought the next few day's meals.

347
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:10,077
- Is it true you'll be transferred?
< I wish!

348
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,402
What do you mean "I wish"? And me?

349
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:18,197
Even if they transferee me,
I'll never forget the community.

350
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:21,916
Besides, you should be glad,
I'd be offered great responsibility.

351
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:24,123
< I know that.

352
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:28,246
But who knows
who they'll send in your place.

353
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:31,399
Maybe some foreign priest.

354
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:38,921
It's late,
they're waiting for you at home.

355
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:42,204
< No. I brought sheets,
I'll go and change the bed.

356
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:57,757
- Will you be eating?
- No, thanks.

357
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:51,644
< Look!

358
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:55,520
< It'll fall on your head.

359
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:04,122
- Let's go to the beach.
< Mm?

360
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:06,767
- I wish I could!
- But you said?

361
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:10,283
- Come on, please?
- On foot?

362
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:13,165
< Yes.
- No.

363
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:16,164
- No.
< Come on!

364
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:21,605
< Good evening.
< Good evening. The rent!

365
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,683
May I?

366
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:31,442
- Our Confirmation girl!
- Here I am.

367
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:34,280
Excuse me, it's untidy.

368
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,198
You're eating,
I'll come buy later?

369
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,324
No, no problem,
our schedule's all out of kilter.

370
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:41,398
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

371
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:44,996
< This is the rent.

372
00:42:52,527 --> 00:42:54,757
- Everything all right?
< Yes.

373
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:00,765
- How's work?
< Fine.

374
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:03,236
< At least it's a job.

375
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:07,036
< If it weren't for the early start,
it'd be perfect.

376
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:10,802
Every job has its drawbacks.

377
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:12,366
Mine's a job too,
it's just that my task is much greater.

378
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:15,439
< I have to protect you...

379
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:17,995
... act in the parishioners' interest.

380
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:22,399
That's why I need to know
if I can count on you,

381
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:24,159
on your family.

382
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:26,556
This isn't a god period,

383
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:30,401
there are so many bad types around.

384
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:34,447
- The elections!
- Of course.

385
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:40,926
- What can I do?
- You should put a signature her,

386
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:43,638
name and surname.

387
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:47,241
- Name: Ventura.
< Yes.

388
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,518
Ventura Rita.

389
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:54,882
Here you go.

390
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:57,037
- Here?
- Yes.

391
00:43:59,727 --> 00:44:02,002
< Your other daughter?
- Rosa?

392
00:44:02,087 --> 00:44:04,760
< (Is she 18?
- Yes, just.

393
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:13,120
< Rosetta!
< What is it? < Come here!

394
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:20,282
< What is it?
I have to study.

395
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,323
< Name and surname.

396
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:26,807
You'll be voting
at the primary school in Via Manzoni,

397
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:30,402
voting station B.

398
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:32,925
I think so.

399
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:39,362
This is the candidate to vote for.

400
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:43,565
For you, too.

401
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:05,445
< Signora Agata, everything all right?
< Yes, please come in.

402
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:07,757
< Did you resolve that problem?
< Yes.

403
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:14,166
< Sara, start from further back.

404
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:18,037
< Far enough, come forward.

405
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:21,597
< Sara, stand up straight..

406
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:24,281
< You're going towards God!

407
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:27,403
Kids...

408
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:32,037
Confirmation
is your spiritual battle,

409
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:34,800
you are now soldiers of Christ.

410
00:45:34,887 --> 00:45:37,606
< You all look like mummies!

411
00:45:37,687 --> 00:45:39,723
< Come on, come forward!

412
00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:43,118
Stop, the formula.

413
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,756
< Holy Ghost, I entrust myself to you.

414
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:49,281
< Eli, eli...

415
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:54,121
- Eli, eli, lema sabachthani.
- Good girl. < What's it mean?

416
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:56,596
They're God's words, Marta.

417
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,963
- But what do they mean?
- It's not the time.

418
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:01,560
Sara, continue.

419
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:05,640
< I entrust myself to you like water
flowing from the font of the sea.

420
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:09,083
Free me of every sin,
forgive me and give me...

421
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:12,876
< Energy, Sara! Energy!

422
00:46:14,327 --> 00:46:16,522
Think of Rambo, do you know him?

423
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:19,964
Come on!

424
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:21,844
Continue.

425
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:23,679
< A cat!

426
00:46:25,007 --> 00:46:27,282
Flavia, a cat's got in.

427
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:33,643
< Children, catch it!

428
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,797
< Natale!

429
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:40,236
< Good, Marta. Catch it!

430
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,237
< Like that.

431
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:45,716
No, kids...

432
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:08,925
Miss Marta Ventura, come with me.

433
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:20,918
The formula.

434
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:28,079
Holy Ghost,
in times of trouble I seek you.

435
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,919
Give me the fear of God...
- Do you believe in God...

436
00:47:33,007 --> 00:47:37,000
... the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible?

437
00:47:39,687 --> 00:47:41,439
I so believe.

438
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:44,724
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
which is the Lord and gives life,

439
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:48,402
the Holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints,

440
00:47:48,487 --> 00:47:51,638
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body...

441
00:47:51,727 --> 00:47:53,683
... and the life everlasting?

442
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,081
I so believe!
I so believe!

443
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:05,399
This is our faith,
the faith of our church...

444
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:09,844
... and we glory to profess it
in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen!

445
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:12,077
At this point, the bishop
will mark you with a cross...

446
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:14,886
... and give you a symbolic slap,
like this!

447
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:17,843
< When I grow up I want to be a saint,
so everyone will give me gifts.

448
00:49:23,567 --> 00:49:25,637
Want a gift?

449
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,722
I'll give you my hair.

450
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:50,164
- Cut it.
- I don't know how.

451
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:52,799
Try.

452
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:55,276
Cut it.

453
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,164
Cut it.

454
00:49:58,087 --> 00:50:00,647
Then you can attach it to yours.

455
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:35,804
I can't do it.

456
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:54,924
Here.

457
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:29,442
- How do I attach it?
- You've got your dress all dirty, look!

458
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:32,325
Where did you get this?

459
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:35,636
I don't want to see.

460
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:41,716
What have you done?

461
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:46,642
Show-off.

462
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:50,441
< Let's go to the hairdresser's.
< No. She stays like that.

463
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:54,156
< She wants to be noticed.

464
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:58,001
< Come on, both of you.
- What did you do?

465
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:03,800
< Debby, let's go!

466
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:12,486
Maybe I'd better not take Confirmation.

467
00:52:19,607 --> 00:52:22,519
Don't add more problems,
Marta, pleas.

468
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,564
Sit up.

469
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:48,881
You were right to cut it.

470
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:52,798
It'll grow out stronger.

471
00:52:58,407 --> 00:53:00,398
After Confirmation
we'll go to the beach.

472
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:09,517
Beautiful.

473
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,965
Like a bride! Your hair to...

474
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:17,526
Is it a custom in your country?

475
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:21,361
< The big day is here,

476
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:24,519
< everything has to be perfect.

477
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:28,077
You, go and hang this in the hall.

478
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,601
You, take care of the tables.

479
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:35,203
You, spread the rug
and take care of the stage.

480
00:53:35,287 --> 00:53:38,359
You, go to the storage room
and get the decorations.

481
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:40,324
Come on, dear. Go.

482
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,121
- No.
< Under the red veil?

483
00:53:48,647 --> 00:53:50,603
< No, maybe under there.

484
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:52,643
< Move stuff.

485
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:07,843
< What have you found?

486
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:29,196
< Oh, yuck!
- I want that!

487
00:54:29,287 --> 00:54:31,801
< Come on!
< Yuck!

488
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:36,403
< They're cute. What do we do with them?
- Let's take them home.

489
00:54:36,487 --> 00:54:40,560
< No way, we have to drown them!

490
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:44,435
My grandpa put them
in bags and boiled them.

491
00:54:44,527 --> 00:54:47,360
-We'll boil you, not the cats!
-Put them down, you'll hurt them.

492
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:49,324
What's going on?

493
00:54:49,407 --> 00:54:52,524
Don't touch them, they carry disease.

494
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:54,438
-Come on, out.
-What disease?

495
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:57,917
< All sorts! All of you, out!

496
00:54:58,007 --> 00:55:01,283
You too, don't touch them,
come out of here.

497
00:55:03,287 --> 00:55:06,324
Gennaro, call Ignazio for me, please!

498
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:08,284
Ignazio!

499
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,996
< Come!

500
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:28,404
What are you doing here?

501
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,315
This leads nowhere.

502
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:28,083
< Marta, isn't that right?

503
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:31,639
< Is everything all right?

504
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:35,804
< What are you doing here?
You should be getting ready.

505
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:01,556
Entryway of the...

506
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,923
Yes, Marta.

507
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:08,439
Think about it.

508
01:00:22,527 --> 01:00:25,963
- How did you get here?
- I walked.

509
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:28,800
< Walked.

510
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:33,397
< Santa? No one...

511
01:00:33,487 --> 01:00:35,921
< Her mother's mobile number?

512
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,401
< I see. All right.

513
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:49,757
- Get in the car.
- No, thanks. I'll go on alone.

514
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:52,407
- Get in the car!
- I was going home.

515
01:00:52,487 --> 01:00:54,523
No one's in.

516
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,438
Stop.

517
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:05,839
< Can you tell me what you were doing?
- Taking a walk.

518
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:09,078
Taking a walk. On the motorway?

519
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:22,443
< Anyway, I really need a hand.

520
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:25,722
- Where are we going?
< A village close by.

521
01:01:27,327 --> 01:01:29,443
The village I was born in.

522
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,955
We're going to get the crucifix.

523
01:01:36,247 --> 01:01:38,078
<We're on a mission.

524
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:03,323
< Wait for me in the car.

525
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:14,117
< Your participation shows the faith...

526
01:02:14,207 --> 01:02:18,678
< ... in our community..

527
01:02:19,327 --> 01:02:22,125
< Thank you.
< Long live Father Mario!

528
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:27,278
Let's start over,

529
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:28,880
music!

530
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:32,039
For the signatures, over here.

531
01:02:34,407 --> 01:02:37,444
- There's only a handful of them.
- There's flu around.

532
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,444
Thank you.

533
01:02:52,327 --> 01:02:53,965
Thank you.

534
01:03:00,327 --> 01:03:02,557
Do you understand me when I talk?

535
01:03:02,647 --> 01:03:05,639
If I tell you to wait in the car,
there's a reason.

536
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:21,324
Hello? Yes, she's with me.

537
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:25,563
< What should I have done?

538
01:03:27,247 --> 01:03:29,363
< Go looking?

539
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:36,879
- Eli, eli, lema sabachthani.
- Yes, I know. I won't get tired.

540
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:41,757
< Eli, eli, lema, sabachthani.
- Keep me informed.

541
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:47,519
- Like something to eat? - No, thanks.
< I was expecting more people.

542
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:49,878
< I'm just here for signatures.
- Sure.

543
01:03:50,087 --> 01:03:52,521
A sweet for the little girl?

544
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:55,162
- A nice bass?
- 15 minutes, no more.

545
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:59,124
Get it ready.

546
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:01,797
- Signora Angela...
- Welcome.

547
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:05,277
I don't want to disturb you,
but I'd like a favor.

548
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:08,359
Pray for my sister,
she has a disease that won't go.

549
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,439
I'm praying so hard.

550
01:04:11,527 --> 01:04:15,042
If you could pray for her too?

551
01:04:15,127 --> 01:04:18,005
- Of course.
- This is her picture.

552
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:21,238
- Her name's Caterina.
- Mum.? - Just a minute...

553
01:04:21,327 --> 01:04:24,478
- Give her a kiss.
- Caterina.

554
01:04:25,967 --> 01:04:28,879
- I'll pray for your sister.
- Thank you, Father Mario.

555
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:33,279
< Excuse her, that's just how she is.
But she cooks great. < I know.

556
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:46,925
- You're not eating?
- I don't eat fish.

557
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:48,645
Too bad.

558
01:04:48,727 --> 01:04:51,195
Know how much calcium it contains?

559
01:05:08,727 --> 01:05:10,843
No, stay right here.

560
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:25,399
Marta, how did you get dirty?

561
01:06:26,927 --> 01:06:29,122
< Miss?

562
01:06:29,807 --> 01:06:32,367
- Occupied.
< Is everything all right?

563
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:35,641
< Take this.

564
01:06:45,327 --> 01:06:47,477
< It's the first time, huh?

565
01:06:50,767 --> 01:06:55,124
< It's a good thing,
even though it seems bad.

566
01:08:25,487 --> 01:08:27,762
I need the toilet.

567
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:39,759
You can go where you want,
there's not soul here. OK?

568
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:41,917
I'll wait for you in the church.

569
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:28,126
What are you doing? Leave him!

570
01:10:49,607 --> 01:10:51,882
< I didn't recognize you.

571
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,675
< I don't see very well these days.

572
01:11:07,607 --> 01:11:10,917
I'm taking it away,
to warmth, safety.

573
01:11:11,007 --> 01:11:14,158
Have you seen the state
you've let it get into?

574
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:19,641
Hello?

575
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:22,195
- How are you?
< Fine.

576
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:29,803
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm late, I need to let them know.

577
01:11:34,487 --> 01:11:36,398
< Hello, Santa?

578
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:53,878
Are you a priest?

579
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:56,718
< Yes.

580
01:11:59,807 --> 01:12:02,879
- You study like priests do?
< Yes.

581
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:14,116
What does,
"eli, eli, lema sabachthani" mean?

582
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:17,520
"Eli, eli..."

583
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:22,681
It's a cry,

584
01:12:22,767 --> 01:12:24,598
it's Jesus crying out...

585
01:12:26,127 --> 01:12:29,244
"My God, why have you forsaken me?"

586
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,441
- Why is he crying out?
- Because he's angry.

587
01:12:38,607 --> 01:12:40,404
How do you imagine him?

588
01:12:41,887 --> 01:12:44,037
- Good.
- Smiling?

589
01:12:45,447 --> 01:12:48,280
< Yes.
- With blue eyes?

590
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:51,844
Ready to hug you?

591
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:56,883
- Yes.
- But he's angry, furious.

592
01:12:58,087 --> 01:13:01,477
He's alone,
running from one place to another.

593
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,957
Everywhere they ask him
for healing, miracles...

594
01:13:08,047 --> 01:13:09,560
... and he runs to them all.

595
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:15,836
With ignorant disciples around him.

596
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:18,805
... who don't understand a thing,
and always ask him for explanations.

597
01:13:18,887 --> 01:13:21,606
They don't have a crumb of imagination.

598
01:13:24,087 --> 01:13:26,237
And they're scandalized.

599
01:13:43,207 --> 01:13:44,720
Read.

600
01:13:49,527 --> 01:13:53,156
"When his family heard this,
they went out to restrain him..."

601
01:13:53,247 --> 01:13:56,159
"... for they said:
He is out of his mind."

602
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:26,644
- He's here. - Who?
- The Bishop.

603
01:14:26,727 --> 01:14:28,922
Now what do we do?

604
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:31,919
He shouldn't have waited till the
last minute to get that crucifix.

605
01:14:32,007 --> 01:14:34,999
- He had other business.
- So what are we supposed to do?

606
01:14:35,087 --> 01:14:39,160
We look like a disorganized parish,
just making it up as we go along.

607
01:14:39,247 --> 01:14:42,922
- I'd say...
- Let's start with the dance.

608
01:17:09,007 --> 01:17:11,362
Marta, let's go, come on!

609
01:17:23,647 --> 01:17:25,558
Give me a hand.

610
01:19:14,527 --> 01:19:17,166
- Hello.
- Hello, dear.

611
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:20,125
- This is my mother.
- Hello, signora. - Good morning.

612
01:19:20,207 --> 01:19:23,404
- A pleasure, Santa.
- Marta?

613
01:19:24,407 --> 01:19:27,638
Didn't she tell you?

614
01:19:27,727 --> 01:19:31,845
Father Mario chose her
for a very important thing,

615
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:36,398
they've gone together
to get the new crucifix.

616
01:19:36,487 --> 01:19:39,081
When? She didn't tell me anything.

617
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:41,806
I don't know. I'm sorry.

618
01:19:51,927 --> 01:19:53,724
Pleas, have on.

619
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:00,840
Wouldn't you like to join us?
There's the dance of the little virgins....

620
01:20:00,927 --> 01:20:04,158
... we've organized lots of nice things.

621
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:08,927
I'll go then, duty calls.

622
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:16,645
May I ask a question?

623
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:20,163
Where exactly will Father Mario
be transferred?

624
01:20:21,247 --> 01:20:23,966
Why this bizarre question?

625
01:20:24,047 --> 01:20:28,677
Since there's a certain degree
of familiarity between us,

626
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:33,318
he told me he might be transferred
to a more famous parish.

627
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:35,443
Signora, who are you?

628
01:20:36,927 --> 01:20:41,682
< Santa! - Yes, but who are you
for our Holy Mother Church?

629
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:44,963
What do you represent?

630
01:20:51,487 --> 01:20:56,003
- His Excellency would like a handkerchief.
- I'll see to it right away.

631
01:22:15,287 --> 01:22:18,085
After Confirmation,
what else do we do?

632
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:21,239
Nothing, we go into church, that's all.

633
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:29,001
- Do you read the Gospel?
- Every day, at Mass.

634
01:22:30,247 --> 01:22:32,681
You know what they said about Jesus?

635
01:22:38,207 --> 01:22:41,085
- What did they say?
- He was mad.

636
01:22:41,847 --> 01:22:43,997
< Nonsense!

637
01:22:46,887 --> 01:22:50,038
Yes - angry, furious.

638
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:21,359
- Can I eat them?
- Yes. - One piece.

639
01:24:29,287 --> 01:24:31,517
< These long hair!

640
01:25:33,007 --> 01:25:35,919
I'm sorry, it's all ready.

641
01:25:46,327 --> 01:25:50,718
So, have you decided?
Will you transfer or stay with us?

642
01:25:53,967 --> 01:25:56,037
Where could I go?

643
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,438
There's a stain.

644
01:26:07,327 --> 01:26:09,921
Everything's ready.

645
01:26:49,007 --> 01:26:52,124
It hurts ... I bit myself.

646
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,801
- What have you done?
- I bit myself.

647
01:26:56,607 --> 01:26:59,838
- I was curious to see that crucifix.
- You know what happened?

648
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:04,955
That little girl Marta cut the ropes
and the crucifix fell.

649
01:27:10,247 --> 01:27:13,159
Don't badmouth my sister.

650
01:27:41,807 --> 01:27:43,843
< My brothers and sisters,

651
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:50,123
first of all
I apologize to the whole community.

652
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:57,522
< Today our children grow up.

653
01:27:59,767 --> 01:28:03,362
Thanks to our Bishop Giorgio,

654
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:08,840
who...

655
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:14,398
with his presence...

656
01:30:21,527 --> 01:30:23,757
Want to see a miracle?

657
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:28,000
Look.

658
01:30:33,007 --> 01:30:34,963
It's still alive.
