00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:19,976
SIX MORAL TALES

2
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:23,419
SUZANNE'S CAREER

3
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:33,124
The Cafe le Luco
on Boulevard St. Michel

4
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:35,928
was where we met Suzanne.

5
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,673
I lived above it.
in the Hotel de l'Observatoire.

6
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:45,073
I was 18 and in my first year
of pharmaceutical school.

7
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,555
Bertrand.

8
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,295
Hello. Sit here.

9
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,430
May I take this chair, miss?

10
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,336
How are you?

11
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,473
I promessi sposi.

12
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,772
Sounds like you know Italian.

13
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,642
Are you at the Sorbonne?

14
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,443
More or less.
I take evening classes

15
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:27,519
at the interpreters' school
at the Sorbonne.

16
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:29,019
During the day I work

17
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:32,715
at the National Tuberculosis
Foundation over there.

18
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,518
you like it?

19
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,528
you can't always do what you like.
And you?

20
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,299
Hey, Martinel!

21
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,330
Martinel Bachelet.

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,132
Suzanne Hocquetot.

23
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,437
- Have a drink?
- Thanks, but I'm meeting someone.

24
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,009
I didn't get your name.
Was it Anne?

25
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,843
no. Suzanne... sadly.

26
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,951
Why sadly?
you're not a snob, are you?

27
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,018
No, but I don't like my name.

28
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,782
- It's better than Suzon.
- Jerk.

29
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:06,187
I'm Guilaume Peuch-Drummond.

30
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:09,591
- I'm Suzanne Hocquetot.
- With an H?

31
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,425
- And t-O-t at the end.
- Are you from Normandy?

32
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,965
yes. you?

33
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,762
no, but I study onomastics.
Know what that is?

34
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,706
- The science of names?
- Proper names.

35
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:23,172
Give me any name,
and I'll tell you...

36
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,074
Will you have a car Saturday?

37
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,240
...where it's from, its etymology.

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,179
Will you have the car?

39
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:34,617
No, my mother's in Paris
till the 17th. Why?

40
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,416
- There's a party at Pfeiffer's.
- I wouldn't go anyway.

41
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,718
- Why?
- Because.

42
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:43,488
I'm giving a dinner Saturday.
Will you come?

43
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,864
What about you?

44
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,898
Why not?
Where is it?

45
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,400
Bourg-ia-Reine.
I' come pick you up.

46
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:52,470
Do you like paella?

47
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:55,004
I'm not sure I've ever tried it.

48
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,905
I do it pretty well.
Do you live with your parents?

49
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,307
No, with some people
near Porte de Clichy.

50
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,506
But I'm hardly ever there.

51
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:05,811
I'm in class till 10:00 p.m.,
and I get up at 7:00.

52
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,510
And Sundays?

53
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:11,282
I work on my Italian,
usually in a cafe.

54
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,289
It's nicer.

55
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:16,691
Nothing's worse than staying
home alone on a Sunday.

56
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,456
It's not even my home.

57
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,061
Guillaume
usually worked fast.

58
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,332
but Suzanne held out
until that dinner.

59
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,886
- Where've you been?
- I've had a lot of work.

60
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,318
Hurry up.
I'm illegally parked.

61
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,753
I may not go.
I'm behind in my work.

62
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,984
- I like people who keep promises.
- I didn't promise.

63
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,288
you dd.
you heard him.

64
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,397
I'll bring you home at midnight.

65
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,664
you always say that.

66
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:57,369
I have to bring Suzanne home too.
Come on.

67
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,470
Oh, all right.

68
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,882
Who'll be there?

69
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,524
Jean-Louis, Catherine, Francois,
Philippe and your grilfriend.

70
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,386
- Who?
- Sophie.

71
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,491
- I don't even know her.
- But you're sweet on her.

72
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,392
Oh, she's not bad.

73
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,462
If he says she's not bad,
she's fantastic.

74
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,299
you saw her.

75
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,738
The other day at the bar.
the Irish girl.

76
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:38,739
She's lovely.

77
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,039
you really have good taste.

78
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,139
Who's Jean-Louis?

79
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,912
The guy at the cafe the other day.
Smokes a pipe.

80
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,055
Most of the year.

81
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:52,715
Guillaume lived alone in the house.
as his mother was traveling.

82
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,395
- It was extraordinary.
- Nothing beats a good chateaubriand.

83
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,226
- You like Chinese food?
- It's terrible!

84
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,231
- Why?
- It makes me sick.

85
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,599
I go to a Chink restaurant
quite often.

86
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,901
Suzanne took her role
as lady of the house seriously.

87
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,307
but Guillaume
went straight after Sophie

88
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:16,040
and seemed set
on breaking down her resistance.

89
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,825
I kept philosophically
to my corner.

90
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:36,663
but l could sense Suzanne
was on the verge of tears.

91
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,876
I thought any minute she'd grab
her coat and run to the station.

92
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:46,205
for I sensed she still had
some self-respect.

93
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,220
Want a cigarette?

94
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,433
you okay?
you're not very talkative tonight.

95
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,038
Sophie intimidated me.

96
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,677
Guillaume was helping me out
by monopolizing her.

97
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,810
I hoped he'd go too far
and be put down.

98
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,652
but he was careful.

99
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,718
What a fantastic player.

100
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:31,824
I saw him on TV in England,
when he won at Wimbledon, but -

101
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,713
It's totally abstract.

102
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,717
Like Mondrian.

103
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,092
Bertrand.

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,952
Going to the kitchen?

105
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,153
Bring the bottle
of Sylvaner, please.

106
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,798
- Where is it?
- By the fireplace.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,730
- By the window?
- That's right.

108
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,440
- How's Sophie?
- you're always with her.

109
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,211
Just to piss the other one off.
Is she sulkng?

110
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,885
Suzanne? A bit.
She's entitled.

111
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:43,691
Good. The easy-lookng ones
are murder. It drags on and on.

112
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,762
Anyway, I think she's
about ready now, don't you?

113
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:49,867
yes, maybe.

114
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:53,165
Sophie's too stuck up for me.
But you've got a chance.

115
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:55,137
Do what you want.
She's not mine.

116
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:58,676
I swear, she likes you.
you can always tell.

117
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,972
What was I going to say?

118
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,949
you've got to do me
a little favor.

119
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,984
When the others leave,
the three of us will stay.

120
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,816
Wouldn't be decent for me
to be alone with her.

121
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,385
If you like. you know...

122
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,801
Bertrand coud squeeze in
with us.

123
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,873
no, thanks.
Good-bye.

124
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:33,279
I have to take
Suzanne home anyway.

125
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,377
So the three of us stayed.

126
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,081
Happy back in his arms.
Suzanne forgot the time.

127
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,487
I began to get impatient.

128
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,095
- Bertrand can make tables move.
- Really?

129
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:54,331
Bertrand, is that really true?
- Yes.

130
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,698
you could make
that one move now? Really?

131
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,864
I don't believe it.

132
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:06,473
Suzanne, you stay there.

133
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,584
Put your hands here.

134
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:16,052
Flatten them out.
Touch my fngers.

135
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,619
Now we have to concentrate.
Don't move.

136
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,525
Relax.

137
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,601
Very, very relaxed.

138
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,467
Don't thnk about anythng.
Let go.

139
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,835
Come on, Suzanne!

140
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,101
Quiet.

141
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,579
- Should I -
- Quiet!

142
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,578
I think it's starting.

143
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,764
very good.

144
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,737
Let's summon the spirit.

145
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,874
Spirit, are you there?

146
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:16,009
One. That's a yes.

147
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,614
Who are you?

148
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,862
D? Danton?

149
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,190
Let's go on.

150
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,423
D-O?

151
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,889
Doumergue?

152
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,301
Bertrand, you're pushing.

153
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,804
It's not me.
It's the spirit.

154
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:25,917
D-O-N?

155
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,494
D-O-N-J?
Must be Don Juan.

156
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,111
What does Don Juan say?

157
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,844
Hey, It's a T.

158
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,123
Let's go on.

159
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,765
L, M, N, O - O?

160
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,475
B?

161
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:44,023
B, C, D, E.

162
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,724
to bed?
Hey, It's ''to bed.''

163
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,232
Bertrand, you're so crude!

164
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,304
Guillaume,
that's going too far.

165
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,513
I'm really tired.

166
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:05,583
I can't face taking you home.

167
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,311
you can stay.
The two of us will sleep here,

168
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,218
and you can use
my mother's room.

169
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:13,059
you know where it is?

170
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,721
Well, good night.

171
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,097
Ah, women...

172
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:45,385
Then. having bowed to convention.
he rushed to join her.

173
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,225
I should really go console her.

174
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,241
The next day I was up
with the first light of day.

175
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,228
I'd already spent a Sunday
at Bourg-la-Reine.

176
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,529
and Guillaume would certainly
have asked me to stay.

177
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:34,674
happy to have an audience
for his triumph.

178
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,767
But I felt my role
had lasted long enough.

179
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,406
Sleep hadn't begun to dispel

180
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,708
the shame I'd felt all evening

181
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,943
at playing along
with my friend's game.

182
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,747
Not that Suzanne's conduct
mattered to me.

183
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,424
It was her business
and hers alone.

184
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:59,225
But I saw the sly pleasure he took
in involving me in his schemes.

185
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,763
For he loved to surround
everything he did.

186
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,337
no matter how banal.
with an air of wickedness.

187
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,404
However. at the time
I rather idolized him...

188
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,103
and accepted him
for what he was.

189
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,772
And he did the same for me.
which I found flattering.

190
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,733
A week later.
I saw him on the Boulevard St. Michel.

191
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,909
- Where've you been?
- What about you?

192
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,582
What's up?
- Oh, problems.

193
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,011
Suzanne?

194
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,209
She calls me all the time.

195
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,617
I always get stuck with these
clinging types. Have you seen her?

196
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:59,952
Once or twce.
We didn't say much.

197
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,754
- Did she mention me?
- no. It was very brief.

198
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,158
She said she'd call.

199
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,799
He didn't really seem
that anxious to break up.

200
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,837
I have a date
with Suzanne tonight.

201
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,477
I thought you'd split up.

202
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,704
A moment of weakness.
Want to come?

203
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,382
What for?
Anyway, I've got work to do.

204
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,678
Come on. damn it!
I have money to blow.

205
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,912
Okay.
Come pick me up.

206
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,299
We went dancing
at a club on the Right Bank.

207
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,530
Suzanne. happy again.

208
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,830
made me her confidant.

209
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,269
a role I didn't care much for.

210
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,672
Her giggles and way of acting
irritated me no end.

211
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,645
I had nothing special
against her.

212
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,478
I simply hated her.

213
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,280
as I did
all Guillaume's conquests.

214
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:07,389
He went after the easy ones.
and. to my knowledge.

215
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,086
he'd never set his sights
on a girl I thought worthy of him.

216
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:15,931
Back then I had a high regard
for his talents as a seducer.

217
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:22,405
the next day. Sunday.
Guillaume called me after lunch.

218
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,656
Hello. Guaume?

219
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,490
I'm bored.
Want to come for tea?

220
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,321
We'll play some music.

221
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,588
Look, I've really got
a lot of work.

222
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,698
Come on.
Come around 5:00.

223
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,198
l'll drive you home at 7.'00.

224
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,300
- Some more tea, Bertrand?
- Please.

225
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,938
- Guillaume?
- no, thanks.

226
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,186
Where did you put
Diary of a Thief?

227
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,085
Over there.

228
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,229
Hey, cut it out!

229
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,899
Don't pout.
It was just a joke.

230
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,438
I don't like
jokes in bad taste.

231
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,774
If I had good taste,
I wouldn't like you.

232
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,846
Well, what counts
is that you like me.

233
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,841
I'm beginning to wonder.

234
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,782
If you don't,
there are plenty of others who do.

235
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:45,481
Pimply-faced kids.

236
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,718
not at all. As good as you.
Better, even.

237
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,561
the gril's no dummy.
She can hold her own.

238
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:10,009
Hold on, Bertrand.
I want to ask you a question.

239
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,944
Suzanne, come here.

240
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,879
Come on!

241
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,986
Bertrand's the best friend
I've ever had.

242
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,290
Stop blushng, damn it.

243
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,092
Sorry.
Are you in love with him?

244
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,932
That's not very flatterng.
- Idiot.

245
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:37,599
- Suppose he came on to you.
- He didn't.

246
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,974
But just suppose.
What if he'd thrown himself at you?

247
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,513
- It's not his style.
- How do you know?

248
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,743
He could have come on to you.
Would you have let him?

249
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,820
I don't think so.
Bertrand's a great guy,

250
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,786
but I have very set ideas.

251
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,823
What about you?
If Suzanne -

252
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,855
Let's just say
I have set ideas too.

253
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,995
You're both such snobs.

254
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,931
Bertrand I can see.
But you're so pretentious.

255
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,832
- What about you?
- That's different.

256
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,904
Don't you think she's a snob?

257
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,837
Not at all.
On the contrary.

258
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,603
Well, of course,
she's a bit dumb.

259
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:14,280
But she can be both.
Stay here!

260
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,574
- Not for this nonsense.
- I say what I think.

261
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,946
Bertrand, don't you think
she's a bit pushy?

262
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,382
- Not at all.
- you've said so.

263
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,682
- You're crazy.
- Come on.

264
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,792
- Why?
- It's pretty obvious.

265
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:30,891
Evidence disallowed.
Debate closed.

266
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,190
Sentence carried out.

267
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,866
Idiot!

268
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,035
Jerk!

269
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,469
You keep getting me
into these things.

270
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:46,438
Just as well. I've been trying
to ditch her for two weeks.

271
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,409
Sure, her body's not bad,

272
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,175
but she has my mother's name.
that gets me.

273
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,695
Want me to take you home?

274
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:12,030
That's kind.

275
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,866
- You could say good-bye.
- Farewell.

276
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,837
''Farewell, young lass, farewell.

277
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,636
Your smile shines in our eyes.''

278
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,137
Listen, I didn't mean anything.

279
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:26,308
Do you forgive me?
Can you forgive me? Really?

280
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,023
Answer me.

281
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,093
Waiting for Suzanne.
I began to transfer the anger

282
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,964
I'd built up
towards Guillaume to her.

283
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:49,104
I could see I'd been stupid
to worry about her.

284
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,108
She deserved what she got.

285
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,779
Guillaume was too nice.

286
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,975
I'm catching the train.

287
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,245
So long.

288
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:04,719
Her total lack of dignity
justified the scorn

289
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:07,758
I'd shown all along
for her looks and behavior.

290
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:15,393
I tried hard to avoid her.
but she sought me out.

291
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:21,240
How are you?

292
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:22,703
All right.

293
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,503
Sit down. You're not in a hurry?
- Yes, I am.

294
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,977
Okay, but I have to leave soon.
I'm expecting a call.

295
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,207
Are you really?

296
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,648
What do you want?

297
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:35,981
Coffee.

298
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,355
Someone was asking about you.
- Who?

299
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,187
Sophie.

300
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:46,090
We had lunch the other day.
She's really a nice girl.

301
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,290
Really? I harldy know her.

302
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:49,863
Going to the dance?

303
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,298
no, I have work to do.

304
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:53,096
That much?
Just this once.

305
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:56,207
- And I'm broke.
- If that's all, I'll pay.

306
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,708
Please, I just got paid.
- I said no.

307
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:03,041
Come on. Do me a favor.
And Sophie'll be there.

308
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,945
No, I couldn't.

309
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:08,746
I'll end you the money.
Pay me back later. Okay?

310
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,716
All right, if you like.

311
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,717
Good.

312
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:30,307
We found Sophie in the crowd
without too much trouble.

313
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,673
She was charming at first.

314
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:39,918
It was the first time
we'd really talked.

315
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:43,618
- You know Guillaume well?
- He's my best friend.

316
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:46,018
Funny, you're really very different.

317
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:49,252
Not really.
We have a lot of the same ideas.

318
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:53,489
But my shyness was paralyzing.
The spark didn't catch fire.

319
00:23:57,003 --> 00:24:00,700
Suzanne carried on
with one ugly guy after another.

320
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,588
Sophie left me after a while.

321
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:23,126
accepting all offers
with a goodwill I found irritating.

322
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,432
She got lost in the crowd.

323
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,041
and I found myself at 3:00 a.m.
alone with Suzanne.

324
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,711
She told me her woes.
which were much like mine.

325
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:43,405
I don't care about Guillaume.
It's over between us, you know.

326
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:46,314
He's an intelligent boy,

327
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,613
but he can be so stupid
about some things.

328
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,154
He's really more dumb than mean.

329
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,052
Luckily, I'm a nice person.

330
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:59,027
But sooner or later,
he'll run up against someone -

331
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,300
The next day. Guillaume
was waiting for me after class.

332
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:14,178
So, bastard,
poaching in my territory?

333
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:17,043
You were seen at the dance.
- Oh, that.

334
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,911
- Did she mention me?
- not at all.

335
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,713
Careful.
She's smarter than you think.

336
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:26,187
- I'll manage.
- She got you to take her.

337
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:28,190
no, she paid.

338
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:32,024
no kidding! She footed the bill?
this is fantastic!

339
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:35,531
That opens up whole worlds.
We'll drive her to ruin.

340
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:42,432
Suzanne! It's been ages.
How are you?

341
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:45,000
very well.

342
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,471
I'm so gad to see you.

343
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,683
May I?

344
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,613
I'm leavng in five minutes.

345
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:08,692
I hear you've been flirting.
Very naughty of you.

346
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,132
And with my best friend.

347
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:33,753
Damn, I'm broke tonight.
Can you get mine?

348
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:38,063
- Bertrand, let me.
- No, don't be silly.

349
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,691
I can treat you if I like.

350
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,027
Sure, if you want to.

351
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,084
For the next two or three weeks.

352
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,278
we deliberately lived off Suzanne.

353
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,288
I hoped she'd tell us off.
but she didn't.

354
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:09,223
and it became
less fun every day.

355
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,788
Guillaume finally left
to visit his mother.

356
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:43,194
But Suzanne kept after me.

357
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,844
Are you snubbing me?

358
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,416
I was upstairs. I waved.
- I didn't see.

359
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:10,248
Got a minute? I've got something
to tell you. Wait upstairs.

360
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,859
When are we going out?

361
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,995
I don't have time these days.

362
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,395
If it's a question of money,
don't worry.

363
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:28,040
Well, precisey.
It does bother me.

364
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:30,772
You're so bourgeois.

365
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,671
Maybe so.
So ask someone else out.

366
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,555
If I wanted to be asked out,
I'd have no trouble.

367
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:46,122
I'm always turning people down.

368
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:48,624
Does it bother you
that I prefer you?

369
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:57,130
I finally agreed.

370
00:28:57,337 --> 00:28:59,703
As I was getting ready.
Guillaume showed up.

371
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,302
How are things?
Where've you been?

372
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:06,134
I was in Menton.

373
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:09,110
My mother remarried.
She's moving there.

374
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,078
Are you keeping the apartment?

375
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:14,111
What's up tonight?
You going out?

376
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,579
I'll take you to dinner.
I've got money.

377
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,725
- No, thanks. I'm busy.
- Suzanne?

378
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,623
You can tell me. Is it?

379
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,264
You two in ove?
- Come on.

380
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,496
- You'll be bored stiff. Take me along.
- Forget it.

381
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,501
I know. Where're you going?
Maitre Paul's?

382
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,669
You're a pain in the ass.

383
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,545
I'll run into you by accident.

384
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,315
If she makes a fuss,
you pay for me.

385
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:47,383
I'll pay you back.

386
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:51,523
It's the least you can do.
I want to have some fun tonight.

387
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:56,086
And if she asked you to Maitre Paul's,
she hopes to see me.

388
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:57,762
Maybe we should get

389
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:00,023
a lobster casserole.

390
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,591
All right. Why not?

391
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,561
Hold on, while I think of it.

392
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,404
Will that be enough?

393
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:13,612
And for an appetizer?

394
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,911
You're following me everywhere.

395
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:21,613
Not much of a hidng place.

396
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,921
We're not hidng.
Have you had dinner?

397
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:27,516
Sit down. Be my guest.

398
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:29,584
No, thanks.

399
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:31,525
Suzanne doesn't want me to.

400
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,431
- Don't be silly.
- Be honest.

401
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:37,262
I am being honest.

402
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:00,325
While Guillaume
was on the phone.

403
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,359
Suzanne handed me
10 more francs. I refused.

404
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:05,258
- No, I invited him.
- You're broke.

405
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:08,195
No more than you.
Go on. Put it away.

406
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,364
Okay, but I'll take you both
to the club.

407
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:15,300
You'll go broke.

408
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:17,066
That's my problem.

409
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,796
Come on. Let's go.

410
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,109
- What about Suzanne?
- No lectures.

411
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,313
Go on, move it.

412
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:04,451
I don't think I can drive.

413
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,420
Come over if you like.

414
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:19,304
But I knew our sneaking out
had been futile.

415
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,268
The next day at noon.

416
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:23,840
the inescapable Suzanne
pounced on me.

417
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,575
How's Guillaume?
Did he sleep it off?

418
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,907
Yes, at my place.
He's still groggy.

419
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,346
Anyway, the party's over.

420
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:34,520
It's only the 12th and I'm broke.

421
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,780
- You have enough for food?
- No, but I'll get by.

422
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,955
I've got some meal tickets.

423
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:45,263
I'm havng lunch with a friend,
a gril who works here.

424
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,458
You know, It's a good thing
you both left last night.

425
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:53,070
I met a wonderfu guy.
A Scotsman.

426
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:56,605
Really a great guy.
We're seeing each other tonight.

427
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,172
Congratulations.

428
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,176
You can tell Guillaume.

429
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,027
I spent that Easter
with my family.

430
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,799
I'd just gotten back
and was unpacking.

431
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:36,710
hiding 400 francs
my parents had given me for a suit.

432
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:39,180
when Guillaume knocked.

433
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,830
- Who is t?
- It's me. Can I come in?

434
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,632
I thought I'd find you.

435
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,274
Have a good vacaton?
- I slept. You?

436
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:07,412
Fantastic! It's amazing the number
of pretty girls in Menton.

437
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:11,308
Just before I left,
I met a really sensational one.

438
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:15,112
One of the prettiest, from Paris.
She'll be back in two days.

439
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:21,319
Problem is, I don't have money
to take her out.

440
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:25,429
My car broke down.
Can you lend me 100 or 200 francs?

441
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,896
- I don't have it.
- I get a money order Monday.

442
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,400
You just saw your parents.

443
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:33,401
Then send me money
week by week.

444
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:37,235
- You don't have 100 francs?
- No, I just paid my rent.

445
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:40,635
It's for me.

446
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,451
Bertrand?
It's Suzanne.

447
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:52,249
How are you?
Did you have a good vacation?

448
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,551
- Good. And you?
- Let's get together.

449
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,820
You going to Daniel's party
next thursday?

450
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,193
Sophie'll be there.
Come on.

451
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,127
I have an exam the next day.

452
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,033
Well, okay.

453
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,900
See. I think about you.

454
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:10,966
thanks.

455
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:13,538
How's your Englishman?

456
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:17,011
Oh. he left.
He wasn't all that interesting anyway.

457
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:27,986
I bet that was Suzanne.

458
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:30,456
Have you seen her since?

459
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:32,528
Once or twice,
before vacaton.

460
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:34,859
- With her Englishman?
- You know about him?

461
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,159
certainly do.

462
00:35:36,936 --> 00:35:39,962
Anyway, she learned her lesson.
The guy split.

463
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:44,132
Admit it: You lied.
It was her, wasn't it?

464
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:50,106
- I sad it wasn't.
- You're lyng.

465
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,183
- Stop beng a pain.
- It was a girl. That's obvious.

466
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:56,014
Sophie, if you must know.
Happy now?

467
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:03,226
Go on, man. Charge!
Girls love to be forced.

468
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,432
That may be.

469
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:22,307
But some things
I'll only take from Guaillume.

470
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,051
He can get away with them.
- I wouldn't take anything from him.

471
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:31,746
I hate these mama's boys
who play tough. It doesn't suit him.

472
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,425
- It's a phase.
- That's the problem.

473
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,924
It's pure snobbery,
and I hate snobs.

474
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,857
He's no snob.

475
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:44,730
What have you got against him anyway?
You don't know him.

476
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,928
- I've heard a lot about him.
- Suzanne?

477
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,107
Yes, Suzanne. Precisely.

478
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,970
She should stop
chasing after him.

479
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:54,237
You really talk like a child.

480
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,262
How are you?
You look tired.

481
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:15,024
A litte bit.

482
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:19,098
I'm such an idiot.
I bought shoes a size too small.

483
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:21,128
that was silly!

484
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,007
Well, you know,
I had to buy them.

485
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:26,769
You never have to!

486
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:28,537
And they're hideous too.

487
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,978
Then why did you buy them?

488
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,708
I just did.
There weren't very many.

489
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:35,418
What do you mean?

490
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:39,079
Well, there weren't,
and they were all really ugly.

491
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,727
Next time
you come shopping with me.

492
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:53,027
Got a second, Bertrand?
I have to talk to you.

493
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,943
Could you lend me
10 francs for a taxi?

494
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:03,547
Sure.

495
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:12,681
I forgot to grab
some money again.

496
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:15,191
Ask Sophie.

497
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,726
No, not her, of all people.

498
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,593
What about what's-his-name?

499
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,130
I'd rather not.
I owe him money.

500
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,598
You've really been living it up.

501
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:38,175
Didn't you know?
I quit my job.

502
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:40,113
What do you live on?

503
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:44,354
Doesn't anyone have a car?
- He does.

504
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:46,791
Jean-Louis.

505
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:50,923
But I'd rather not.
Oh, well, why not?

506
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:56,161
We could stop by my place.
You mind walkng?

507
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:59,337
Thanks, but you'd have
to climb those stairs twice.

508
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:00,698
I don't mind.

509
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,940
There aren't any taxis
where you live.

510
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:07,942
I'd be scared out there alone.

511
00:39:08,147 --> 00:39:09,876
I'd go with you.

512
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,442
If you don't mind,
I could come to your place.

513
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,143
I won't talk.

514
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,188
I'll curl up and read
in an armchair.

515
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:22,684
Okay, but we have
to be quiet going in.

516
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:26,054
Protecting your reputation?

517
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:41,237
As soon as we arrived.
she sat in the armchair.

518
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:10,370
- Darn.
- What?

519
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,204
I tore my skrit again.
Do you have a pin?

520
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,676
Better than that:
needle and thread.

521
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,246
Terrific.

522
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:23,213
Trouble is,
this is my only presentable skirt.

523
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:26,352
- What about the dress at the dance?
- I borrowed that.

524
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:29,493
Anyway,
I couldn't wear it every day.

525
00:40:36,302 --> 00:40:38,668
I don't suppose
you'd have a thimble?

526
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:40,463
You don't need one.

527
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:44,242
Look, I'm not pushng.
I'm pulling.

528
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,575
Oh, boys!

529
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:50,482
All right. I get t.
- Then do it yourself.

530
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,588
I may be a boor,

531
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:06,094
but I can only sleep in my bed,

532
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:08,400
and I have an exam tomorrow.

533
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,529
that's okay. I'm fine.

534
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,132
I'm really furious at myself

535
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,070
for being taken in
by that dumb salesgirl.

536
00:41:17,276 --> 00:41:19,574
I really can't wear these shoes,

537
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,177
and I don't have any others.

538
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,904
Take them back.

539
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:25,515
I can't. I've already worn them
for two days.

540
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:28,346
And I broke my last
10-franc b today.

541
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:31,114
- Things are really bad.
- Yes, they are.

542
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:36,284
I'd lend you some,
but I have a dentist's bill.

543
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,326
If you coud wait
until next month.

544
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,523
Please, Bertrand.
You're very sweet, but I'll be a right.

545
00:41:42,735 --> 00:41:46,694
I'm reay embarrassed.
You spent everything on me.

546
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,635
If I did,
it was because I wanted to.

547
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:52,402
We had some great times,
didn't we?

548
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,168
That's what counts.

549
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,679
I can always find money.
I just have to look for it.

550
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,849
You know, what I'd like
is a part-time job.

551
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:04,648
Anyway, I think I'll head
for Italy soon.

552
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:07,116
I'm tired of all
these little Frenchmen.

553
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:09,226
Handsome men there,
they say.

554
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:12,556
It's funny.
I've never met a boy I liked.

555
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:14,323
Not a one.

556
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,696
You're too hard to pease.

557
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,831
And you aren't?

558
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:23,873
Whatever you might think,
I never took Guillaume seriously,

559
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:26,943
even if I was
a little bit in love with him.

560
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:30,311
I'll tell you, you're the only one
I can stand.

561
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:34,383
You're a real louse,
but we understand each other.

562
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:38,089
Other guys just want to sleep with you,
and then it's ''so long.''

563
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,815
I know 10 guys
who'd do anythng for you.

564
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:44,189
- Who?
- I don't know. Jean-Louis, Francois.

565
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:47,496
If that's the best you can offer -

566
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,532
No, you're the only one I like.

567
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,761
I'm relaxed with you.

568
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,030
You know, it's rare to find
a guy like you,

569
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,333
who doesn't pester girls.

570
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:06,951
- I'm selective.
- Thanks.

571
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:08,744
Sorry, it slipped out.

572
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:11,184
You can be
so stupid sometimes.

573
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,221
- What?
- Nothing.

574
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:16,794
Believe me,
I wish you all the best.

575
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,656
I never doubted it.

576
00:43:20,466 --> 00:43:22,593
- How's your love life?
- Not great.

577
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:25,827
Listen, you've got
to take things in hand.

578
00:43:26,205 --> 00:43:28,537
Girls like to be forced.

579
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,605
Another of Guillaume's theories.

580
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:34,108
- He knows.
- Not necessarily. Not always.

581
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,817
With a girl like Sophie,
you can't hold back.

582
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,544
She's on the defensive,
but it's a facade.

583
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:46,622
She has to be,
with a those boys around her.

584
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:53,463
- I know what I'm doing.
- You're funny.

585
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:56,896
Fine. You know,
I'm not as nice as I seem.

586
00:43:57,102 --> 00:44:00,299
I know. I know you.
I know you very well.

587
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:03,441
If we know each other so well,
why all this talk?

588
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:56,055
Suzanne, I'm leaving
in five minutes.

589
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:15,409
Suzanne, come on.

590
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:27,116
May I do your room now?

591
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:30,019
No. l'd rather you waited
till 11:00.

592
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,765
Are you listening?

593
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,807
Wait for me untill 11:00.

594
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:00,683
You're going out?

595
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:03,827
No. l'll be back in a minute.
Come at 11:00.

596
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:31,587
''I have to leave.
Have to meet someone.''

597
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:03,040
Have you seen Suzanne?

598
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,148
She was here haf an hour ago.

599
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,682
- You know her address?
- You'd know better than me.

600
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:09,945
Try Guillaume.

601
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:21,224
Sophie? It's Bertrand.

602
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:24,231
- Did your exam go well?
- Yes. I think so.

603
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:26,131
I slept all morning.

604
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:28,033
I wasn't so lucky.

605
00:48:30,542 --> 00:48:33,773
I need to ask you:
Do you have Suzanne's address?

606
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:36,641
No. she lives near Clichy.
Guillaume must know.

607
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:38,475
I can't reach him.

608
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:41,015
- ls it urgent?
- Very.

609
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:43,577
Will you be seeing her?

610
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:46,485
Maybe. She calls me
almost every day.

611
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:49,285
Any message?
- Yes. I mean -

612
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:52,759
I have to go.
Meet me tomorrow afternoon.

613
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:53,931
At 4:00?

614
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:56,566
Yes. Bye. Bertrand.
See you tomorrow.

615
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,823
This unhoped-for date
cooled my anger.

616
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:23,252
Sophie's attitude toward me
had changed radically.

617
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:26,431
though she offered
nothing more than friendship.

618
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:31,129
But it was a step forward.
and her school was nearby.

619
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:33,463
which made meeting easier.

620
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,232
I amost lodged a complaint
at the hotel, but that would mean -

621
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:41,742
You don't want them to know
you bring girls up.

622
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:44,972
Anyway, I'm sure it wasn't her.

623
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,185
- I'm sure it was.
- It could have been anyone.

624
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,150
In a hotel, you know,
the maid -

625
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:52,721
Definitey not.

626
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:54,619
One of your pals?
Guillaume?

627
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:55,793
Him again!

628
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:59,528
Why not?
You think he'd have any scruples?

629
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:03,223
For something like that, yes.
And I never left him alone.

630
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:06,362
No, It wasn't him.
That's not his style.

631
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,535
He bankrupted Suzanne.

632
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:12,801
That's different.
He was having fun.

633
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:16,378
Some fun. He's leading you
around by the nose.

634
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,173
You're crazy.

635
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:29,221
Was it Guillaume?
I only saw him twice all term.

636
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:32,260
He had a lot of work.
and so did I.

637
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:35,831
I couldn't tell him about the theft
for fear of his sarcastic comments.

638
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,002
Besides. he'd just deny it.

639
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:46,642
Anyway. I preferred to think
Suzanne was guilty

640
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:49,006
than to suspect Guillaume.

641
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:52,911
whose dirty tricks had never been
aimed at me before.

642
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:00,049
What makes me think
it's not Guillaume

643
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:03,085
is the 100 francs
left in the book.

644
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:07,589
And it was pretty clumsy.
More like Suzanne.

645
00:51:10,302 --> 00:51:12,361
Basically, she was a nice girl.

646
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:15,165
Ah, so glad to hear it.

647
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:17,874
I've always said
she was ugly, but -

648
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:20,169
ugly. That's all you can say.

649
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:22,938
She's not ugy.
Maybe not a classic beauty,

650
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:26,208
but she's very attractive
and elegant.

651
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:28,716
She has lovey limbs,
beautiful hands.

652
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,888
The quintessential
young French girl.

653
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,182
Doesn't make me feel patriotic.

654
00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:36,484
- And men find her attractive.
- Not me.

655
00:51:36,695 --> 00:51:39,129
- No wonder. You're just a kid.
- So kids like you?

656
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:41,891
That's my cross to bear, yes.

657
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:45,001
Stop, or I'll get angry.

658
00:51:58,717 --> 00:52:01,686
l'd decided never to ask Sophie
about Suzanne again.

659
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,313
It was her
who brought her up.

660
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,091
I guess I can tell you.

661
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,457
Suzanne's getting married.

662
00:52:10,095 --> 00:52:13,121
- You've seen her?
- She's been calling me.

663
00:52:13,732 --> 00:52:15,222
Well, well.

664
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:16,422
to whom?

665
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:19,433
A fellow who -
You know him.

666
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:20,798
Franck Schaller.

667
00:52:21,006 --> 00:52:22,667
No, I can't place him.

668
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:25,104
He was at Guillaume's
party that night.

669
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,905
He came with me.
A tall guy with a cowlick.

670
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:30,877
So she stole him from you.

671
00:52:31,082 --> 00:52:32,674
You idiot!

672
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:02,742
This unexpected conclusion

673
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,780
led me to seriously
revise my thinking.

674
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:14,024
Until then. I'd only thought
of Suzanne as Guillaume's victim.

675
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,555
But she didn't flatter his ego

676
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:20,993
as much as she brought out certain
tendencies he kept quiet about.

677
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:35,843
there was
a clear physical resemblance.

678
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:37,981
I finally began to see.

679
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:40,344
between all
of Guillaume's girls.

680
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:43,313
they weren't ugly. as I'd said.

681
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:46,957
and similar less in face
than in figure.

682
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:50,756
Dismissing tall girls
like Sophie as storks.

683
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:54,321
Guillaume didn't try to justify

684
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:57,262
his attraction
to small. plump women.

685
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:04,407
The year was ending.

686
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:09,046
While I was flunking my exams
and losing Sophie.

687
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:12,045
Suzanne was happy.

688
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,991
Without even meaning to.
she was mocking me.

689
00:54:22,894 --> 00:54:26,455
this girl for whom
l'd only managed to feel

690
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,859
a kind of shameful pity

691
00:54:29,234 --> 00:54:32,328
was beating us all
to the finish line

692
00:54:32,537 --> 00:54:34,698
and showing us up to be

693
00:54:34,906 --> 00:54:36,601
the children we were.

694
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:40,533
Innocent or guilty.
naive or cunning.

695
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:42,770
what did it matter?

696
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:45,872
By depriving me
of the right to pity her.

697
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:48,882
Suzanne had her true revenge.
