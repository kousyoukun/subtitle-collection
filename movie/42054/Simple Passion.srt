2
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,625

3
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,625

5

7
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,791

8
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,208
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I have vague memories of my life then.</font></i>

9
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,458
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">When I can't sleep, I think</font></i>

10
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,750
of Porto where I spent a week
before I first saw him.

11
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,083
I remember my schedule,

12
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,625
all my walks...

13
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,708
I recall my room
in the annex of the Hotel Albar.

14
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,208
In my mind, I list the things

15
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,041
found there.

16
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,666
The objects, for instance.

17
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,791
And I also think back

18
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,666
to my journey to that party

19
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,625
where I first saw him over dinner.

20
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:27,041
Everything that happened before we met,
before it all began.

21
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,000
As if a perfect inventory
would let me live it again.

22
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:42,583
I'm obsessed by the idea of returning
to that same hotel room in Porto.

23
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,458
Actually, since he left,

24
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,625
all my deeds and thoughts are

25
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,583
like a repetition
of the time before I met him.

26
00:03:55,625 --> 00:04:00,041
As if to force the past
to become the present again:

27
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,500
open to happiness.

28
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,750
I won't ask anything of you.

29
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,416
But do you have to go?

30
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,958
Yes.

31
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,833
Done your homework?

32
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,500
Yeah.

33
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,541
Not yeah, yes.

34
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,291
What did you eat at school?

35
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,666
Nothing.
It was ratatouille, dog food.

36
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,750
Paul...

37
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,958
Stay in Hiroshima with me.

38
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,833
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">He'll come towards me.</font></i>

39
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,458
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">He'll lay his hands on my shoulders.</font></i>

40
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,916
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">He'll kiss me.</font></i>

41
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,750
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">He'll kiss me and I'll be lost.</font></i>

42
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,583
No coverage here?

43
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,666
No idea.

44
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,333
Did you like it?

45
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,291
Him, yes. Her not so much.

46
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,583
Why him and not her?

47
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,791
It's like any other film.

48
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,875
A beautiful, desired woman
for whom it's normal.

49
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,666
It's a male fantasy.

50
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,541
Some women are never loved,

51
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,541
even that beautiful.

52
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,833
And less beautiful women
who deserve love

53
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,583
stay invisible.

54
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,541
You're over-analysing it, Hélène.

55
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,083
Let's get a drink.

56
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,375
Everyone does it.

57
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,041
There are thousands of apps.

58
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:45,791
You can see who's free around you,
anywhere, even in your suburb.

59
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,875
Try it, it works.

60
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,041
I haven't done it,
but my sister keeps trying guys.

61
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,791
I'd like to try something like it.

62
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,458
Why would I try?

63
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,333
You're free.

64
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,583
- Free?
- I mean, you barely see that guy.

65
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,458
For me,

66
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,541
you're not like the woman in the film.

67
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,666
Will here do?

68
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,041
Thanks.

69
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,416
He has a great body and butt.

70
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,458
It helps.

71
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,541
Not you.
Well, I don't know...

72
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,416
Does a man in love
close his eyes to kiss?

73
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,041
Hélène...

74
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,791
Be careful.

75
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,250
He's married, he'll go home to Russia.

76
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,958
Be reasonable.

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,583
Of course.

78
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,291
Forget it.
Here's to us.

79
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,458
I'm not in love with him.

80
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,708
No. Not a bit.

81
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,291
From what you say,
you're in love with love itself.

82
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,875
The other day,
when I got whisky from the kitchen,

83
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,083
I remembered an aunt of mine.

84
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,791
My mother always told me

85
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,916
she'd receive her lover
in the afternoon.

86
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,875
The whole village knew
and gossiped about her.

87
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:19,208
I wonder if people blamed her
for being unfaithful

88
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,875
or for making love
instead of cleaning her windows.

89
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,458
Just then, I thought of her
with a lot of satisfaction.

90
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,625
It's good when that happens.

91
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,125
I mean...

92
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,333
those women with a sudden urge

93
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,416
to flee comfort, bourgeois boredom,
cheat on their men

94
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,791
and bang some little hood
with nothing to offer.

95
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,083
Thanks a lot.

96
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,125
I don't mean you.

It's no big deal.

133

All we can do is name things,

134
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,416
listing them
in a banal and precise manner,

135
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,833
trying to forget nothing...

136
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,958
Forget nothing...

137
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,125
Where are my soccer shorts?

138
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,625
Your shorts? On the...

There is no guy.

142

I've dreamed of kissing you for days.

143
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,583
Are you ok?

00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,291
Yes.

145
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,541
I've never felt this with anyone.

146
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,750
Fucking with you is so good.

147
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,666
Poetry's own goal is poetry.

148
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:06,916
And no poem is as beautiful, noble
and worthy of being called a poem

149
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,208
as one written for the pleasure
of writing a poem.

150
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,291
Baudelaire knew that.

151
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,750
He was stigmatized, humiliated
and called a poser,

152
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,500
the ultimate slight, for writing.

153
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:24,375
Aphra Behn, the writer I'll talk about,
was even referred to as a prostitute

154
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,875
or a hermaphrodite,
a monster half-man, half-woman,

155
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,166
because she wrote.

156
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,583
Well?

157
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,500
Well?

158
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,166
Well what?

159
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,083
I drove like crazy to get here.

160
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,666
This is for you.

161
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,875
It's a little note.

162
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,166
Don't read it now.
Read it in the car.

163
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,375
You can throw it from the window
or tear it up.

164
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,208
You don't have to.

165
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,666
That's kind.

166
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,333
Tell your wife you bought a new shirt.

167
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:54,875
Thank you.

My boyfriend's left.

170
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,416
I can do a mask. And the ends too.

171
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,791
I don't know...

172
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,375
I feel exhausted.

173
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,583
I'm on anti-depressants.

174
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,083
I think it shows.
It must damage my hair somehow.

175
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,208
I'll look after you.

176
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,708
Relax.

177
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,583
Where did I put my bag?

178
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,791
Here it is.

179
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,291
Thank you.

You know, I'm working on a writer
called Aphra Behn.

186
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,166
Did I tell you she was a spy?

187
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,541
She had two names, for instance.

188
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,041
Who did she spy on?

189
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,833
The last time...

190
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,916
she was spying

191
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:35,250
on the Belgian court but got arrested.
So she began to write.

192
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,708
You...

193
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,291
Do you have two names?

194
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,125
You think I'm a spy?

195
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:08,333
What do you do at the embassy
if you're not a spy?

196
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,541
I work in security, you know.

197
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,958
It's complicated.

198
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And...

199
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:26,666
How did you get into that?
Were you in prison?

200
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,291
Your tattoos... What's this?

201
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,375
That?

202
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,958
It's a turning wheel.

203
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,708
And you?

204
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,416
You're not afraid of me?

205
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,458
You know,

206
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:58,625
I'm very happy to see you, Alexandre.

207
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,583
I don't care about all the rest.

208
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:07,666
That you're married, that I can't call,
write or send messages.

209
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:10,416
That you decide
when we see each other.

210
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,166
I don't care about that.

211
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:32,583
I'll be away three weeks, maybe more.
With my wife.

212
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:12,875
Thank you.

213
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,125
You're really kind, miss.

214
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:14,958
What if we went away tomorrow
to Florence?

215
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,708
Well?

216
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,958
You forget I have school.

217
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,125
You forgot the alarm yesterday.

218
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,375
There's time, don't worry.

219
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:27,583
Friday is off anyway.
You'll only miss two days.

220
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,375
It's not your exam year.

221
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:34,125
We won't go far. I'll write a note.

222
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,666
Mom...

223
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,791
I don't want to go.

224
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,416
Please, sweetheart.

225
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,666
Paul!

226
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,708
Why is it white there?

227
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,541
- What?
- Why is it white there, not brown?

228
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,416
Because all the leftists in the city

229
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,125
write slogans on the church wall.

230
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,375
And then the priest

231
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,791
comes out every morning

232
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,333
to paint over them.

233
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:32,875
My dear...

234
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,500
What's wrong?

235
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,791
No...

236
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,583
Listen.

237
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,625
Make three wishes.

238
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
One of them will come true.

239
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,208
But you have to believe.

240
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,958
Chin up. Don't cry.

241
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:30,916
Shall we go?

242
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,083
Coming.

243
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:33,875
Come on.

244
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,125
When you study
past centuries' literature,

245
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,750
try to understand the life
of those who wrote it,

246
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:32,291
enter a vague and familiar world
underlying ours,

247
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,750
yet foreign at the same time.

248
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:36,000
So...

249
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:02,125
So, what is a female writer's life like?

250
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:04,791
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hélène...</font></i>

Aren't you afraid someone will see us?

257
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,416
No.

258
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,250
Where did you go with your wife?

259
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:15,583
Just to imagine you there.

260
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,708
Lake Baikal.

261
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:40,958
Have you missed me?

262
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,083
Yes.

263

Very much.

You go out in a skirt like that?

265
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,125
Yes.

266
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,750
Are you jealous?

267
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:01,750
Men see your ass.

268
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:03,250
So?

269
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,333
So...

270
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,291
Do I give my opinion about you?

271
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,166
Do I give my opinion about you?

272
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,875
Shit.

273
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,375
What did you do?

274
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,291
I love you, sweetheart.
You're my life.

275
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:30,875
Fruit, then bed.
You have to be up early tomorrow.

276
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:34,958
Can I stay at Antoine's Thursday?

277
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:36,583
When's Thursday?

278
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,375
When's Thursday?
You ask when it is?

279
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,583
Between Wednesday and Friday.

280
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:45,375

283
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,958
I have to check if I can.

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Try your best.</font></i>

All I want to do is see him, understand?

287
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,625
I'd like to do nothing else.

288
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,291
Just see him, all day long.

289
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,541
This morning, I was...

290
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:18,208
My guy is an inveterate crook,
living off his stepmother's Visa card.

291
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:22,458
It takes a real beating that weekend.

292
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,916
He decides to let his stepmother
enjoy it a little.

293
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:30,625
After all,
she lets him live the high life...

So you'd think of me

301

and so you'd dream of me,
Mrs Augoust.

Thank you.

303

But not Mrs Augoust.

304

316
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,458
And I think I actually flew.

317
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,166
And the others? Me?

318
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,916
Where was I?

319
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:21,208
The others? No idea.
They had vanished by the dream's end.

320
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,958
And you had vanished too.

321
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:38,125
You've never said...
What do you drink at breakfast?

322
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Coffee.

323
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,041
You eat nothing?

324
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:46,541
No.

325
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,291
Your wife makes your coffee?

326
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
No.

327
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:10,666
Where did you live in Russia?

328
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:12,750
What street in Moscow?

329
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:16,708
Tverskaya. In the city centre.

330
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:19,583
Come here.

331
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:41,708
Are you going to Russia at Christmas?

332
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,541
With your wife?

333
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:53,708
We're so different.
He likes Dior suits and cars.

334
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,041
Big cars.

335
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:56,958
He drives fast,

336
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,958
flashing his headlights,
without speaking,

337
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,166
as if basking
in the feeling of being free

338
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:05,791
and well dressed
on a French freeway.

339
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:10,583
He hates books and intellectual stuff.
He loves Hollywood crap and Putin.

340
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:12,416
And I don't really care.

341
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,625
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">But he's married and he's younger.</font></i>

342
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,166
It doesn't matter.

343
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,875
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hello, it's the Arsenal Library.</font></i>

344
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:17,791
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">The complete works of Aphra Behn,
the English writer, aren't available.</font></i>

345
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:18,958
Ok.

346
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,958
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">There's a single copy in Antwerp
at the Hendrick Conscience Library.</font></i>

347
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:29,083
Thank you, but I can't really talk now.

348
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,208
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Sorry for bothering you.</font></i>

349
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,541
Goodbye.

350
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,375
I love you.

351
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,208
I love you.

352
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:10,916
I sometimes often
make love to my wife, you know.

353
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:13,958
Sometimes often?

354
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,500
What does that mean?

355
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,916
Does she turn you on like I do?

356
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:32,666
How do I know this isn't the last time?

357
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:37,083
I have to go away.
Don't call me on my phone.

358
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:39,583
Is that an order?

359
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,250
Tell me it's not the last time.

360
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,416
Stay.

361
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:14,833
Please.

362
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:23,250
Why look at me that way
if you don't care?

363
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:00,958
Why keep waiting? It's all you do.

364
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,000
I don't know.

365
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:05,208
What else can I do?

366
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,333
Want to know what I think?

367
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:10,166
I think that when men get
what they want,

368
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,666
they panic and turn nasty.

369
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:17,250
It's true of your guy and mine.
But mine hasn't the guts to leave.

370
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,041
Great things are happening.
These feminists

371
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:23,958
are right to cry out.
I support them.

372
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,583
We've waited centuries
to speak.

373
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:31,291
What? We have to rely
on a man for sex, life, everything...

374
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:32,708
It's unbearable!

375
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:36,625
That's not the point.

376
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,041
Even feminists turn submissive
once they're in love.

377
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,458
Lots of them.

378
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,583
I don't know
or perhaps you're just blind.

379
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,541
Maybe he doesn't love you.

380
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:49,250
I'm sorry.

381
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,416
I'm in no position to lecture you.

382
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,333
What place are you playing today?

383
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:39,833
Not place, position.

384
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:42,541
Position? So what position?

385
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:43,958
Striker.

386
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,041
Near the other team's goal to score.

387
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,833
Ok! So that's the plan for today?

388
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,875
I'd love to see that.

389
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:55,208
But you can't?

390
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,458
No, I can't.
I have to work on my research.

391
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,291
You said that last time too.

392
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:04,833
Last time I lied,
but today it's true.

393
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,791
Maybe you're lying now.

394
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:10,666
Don't worry,
I swear I'll come next time.

395
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:13,166
I really will.

396
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:16,333
You said that last time too.

397
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:26,416
Malo's mom will drive me home.

398
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:27,375
Ok.

399
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:29,791
Have a good day, Mom.

400
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:39,583
Stop!

401
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,541
- Are you ok?
- You nearly ran me over!

402
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:48,125
- You're not hurt?
- I am!

403
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,416
What?

404
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,458
You're not letting me in?

405
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,083
No.

406
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,541
I have to work.

407
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,125
You didn't say that yesterday.

408
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,041
No.

409
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,125
It just landed on me.

410
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,125
You want to play at that?

411
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,875
I'm not playing.

412
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,583
- Is that what you want?
- No.

413
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,666
And now?

414
01:03:58,708 --> 01:03:59,708
No.

415
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:01,833
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Welcome. No new messages.</font></i>

Yes.

No, thank you.

I don't know.

443
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:33,250
Are you driving? Walking?

444
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:34,375
Sorry?

445
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:37,583
- Are you here on foot?
- Yes.

446
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:40,333
It's a risky area.

447
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:41,916
I know that.

448
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:45,333
You seem a bit lost.

449
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:48,333
I'm waiting for a cab.

450
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:50,083
- A cab?
- Yes.

451
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,875
There aren't any here.

452
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,250
One is bound to arrive.

453
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,000
Shall I call one?

454
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,000
It's ok, thank you.

455
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:00,875
Can I drop you somewhere?

456
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,833
No, thank you.

457
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:09,416
Unless you take me to the station
or to my car.

458
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:11,000
Where's your car?

459
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,125
Sorry?

460
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:13,416
Where's your car?

461
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,625
I can't remember.

462
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:20,333
Hold on a second.
Sorry, I sound a bit stupid.

463
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,750
No, not stupid, just lost.

464
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:26,833
I was near Place de l'Etoile.

465
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,583
Near Etoile.

466
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:31,125
Etoile? That's back there.

467
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:33,500
That way?

468
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:35,333
You have to turn back.

469
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:40,333
It's a 5-minute drive.

470
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:41,541
Really.

471
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:47,500
I'm a bit lost too.
We can both be lost.

472
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,416
You're a bit lost like me.

473
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:54,250
You thought, "If she's lost
and I'm lost, she'll listen."

474
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:57,791
Well, yeah.
But maybe I have things to say.

475
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:59,666
Life's cruel, isn't it?

476
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:54,083
Hélène.

477
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:08,666
Why are you here?

478
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,916
Paul asked me to fetch him.

479
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,041
What?

480
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:14,208
He'll stay till Wednesday.

481
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,333
Why?

482
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,125
It doesn't suit you?

483
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,916
What's wrong with you?
Do you need a doctor?

484
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,500
No, I had the flu.

485
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:30,166
- It'll pass.
- What'll pass?

486
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,708
Paul, can you leave us?

487
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,708
No need, we're going.

488
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,250
What's that crap?

489
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,833
Leave it there.

490
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,250
You take this crap?

491
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:46,541
Mind your own business.
Leave it.

492
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,958
Paul, leave us, please.

493
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:52,041
You spend all day nude.

494
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,625
My problem.

495
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,208
That's not for the flu.

496
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,416
I'm not totally stupid.

497
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:01,250
You fuck all day,
you can't even cook pasta...

498
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,791
Don't hush me, he told me.

499
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:05,333
Come on...

500
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:07,625
Two weeks he's fended for himself.

501
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:09,333
You don't even buy food?

502
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,541
You nearly ran him over!

503
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:13,791
It's ok.

504
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:14,958
You say it's ok?

505
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:17,708
- You're losing it.
- I know.

506
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,333
I left you the house,
I pay alimony...

507
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:21,625
Not again...

508
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:22,958
Every month.

509
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,333
Are you losing it or what?

510
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:28,583
I'm screwing up, I know.

511
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:31,166
Is this some teen meltdown?

512
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,000
You're a wreck.

513
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:36,625
Give me a break.

514
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:39,458
I'm sorry, Paul.

515
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:44,708
And now you have to piss me off too!

516
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,333
Let's go, Paul.

517
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:55,500
What an asshole.

518
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,250
Alexandre!

519
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:56,666
Alexandre!

520
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:11,833
Alexandre?

521
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,125
I miss you.

522
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:15,875
Excuse me.

523
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:17,875
Sorry.

524
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:03,583
I need a prescription.

525
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:06,833
Tranquilizers. I can't sleep.

526
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,333
I need a sick note for my classes too.

527
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:12,583
To have a few weeks off.

528
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:16,416
I can't go on.
I teach at university and...

529
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:18,083
It's complicated.

530
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,791
I'd like to sleep, but I can't.

531
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,833
How long has this been going on?

532
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:30,541
Tell me.

533
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,750
Since last September,

534
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:45,375
all I've done is wait for a man.

535
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:48,625
For him to call, to come to my place.

536
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,333
I kept working, I went to movies,

537
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:56,791
I did the shopping, I read...

538
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:01,000
But everything I did seemed to be...

539
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:04,250
cut off from reality.

540
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:11,041
I have vague memories of my life then.

541
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:12,750
Of the people I saw...

542
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,458
Without him knowing,
that man connected me to the world.

543
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:28,583
He gave my life rhythm.
I measured time by him.

544
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:35,208
I tried to be normal with others,
not to reveal anything.

545
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:38,791
But when I was in a group of women,

546
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:42,250
at the supermarket checkout
or at the bank,

547
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:46,750
I wondered if they had a man in mind
at all times like me

548
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:50,833
or, if they didn't,
how they managed to survive.

549
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,250
I've given up working on my thesis.

550
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,916
I can't even raise my son.

551
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,666
I even went to Moscow for a few hours

552
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:09,208
to smell the air he breathes.

553
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:13,041
Was that good?

554
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,208
Oh, yes.

555
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:33,333
It is Tverskaya?

556
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,500
The centre?

557
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:56,083
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">8 months later</font></i>

558
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,166
I'm so proud!

559
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:46,000
It's 8 o'clock. Rise and shine.

560
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:53,333
I liked it when you forgot.

561
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:54,375
You did?

562
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:57,416
Get dressed.

563
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,208
Wait till I go. Spare me that.

564
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:01,458
Nice...

565
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:36,458
Hello.

566
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:41,583
Thank you.

567
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,291
16.28 euros.

568
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:51,375
There you go. Have a good day.

569
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:53,041
Hello.

570
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,958
Excuse me, ma'am.

571
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,833
Your cart isn't empty.

572
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:02,875
- Sorry.
- No worries.

573
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:16,708
Can you get that?

574
01:27:17,041 --> 01:27:19,000
Don't know where it is.

575
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,291

577
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:48,791
Can you sleep at Malo's? Call him.

578
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:01,166
Can you call him?

579
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:04,500
No reply.

580
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:07,583
The neighbours then. Call Valentin.

581
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:09,083
But why?

582
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,166
Why?

583
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,166
I don't want to go.

584
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:22,750
Do it for me, ok.
Don't worry, everything's fine.

585
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:23,791
Get ready.

586
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,708
Where are you staying?

587
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:17,166
At a hotel.

588
01:30:18,916 --> 01:30:20,375
Stay here then.

589
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,000
No, I'm expected.

590
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:27,000
People I work with.

591
01:30:28,708 --> 01:30:33,541
I'll drive you in your car,
then get a cab. You've drunk too much.

592
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:07,000
Our affair...

593
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:09,541
Is it over?

594
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:14,416
I'll never see you again?

595
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,250
I'll call you.

596
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,416
Know the meaning of those words?

597
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:23,500
Your son, Paul... Is he well?

598
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,416
Yes.

599
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:29,000
You never asked about him before.

600
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:34,333
Have you finished work on the spy?

601
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,833
I found nothing.

602
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:39,750
Well, no, I found a lot of stuff.

603
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:42,000
She was more a lover than a spy.
