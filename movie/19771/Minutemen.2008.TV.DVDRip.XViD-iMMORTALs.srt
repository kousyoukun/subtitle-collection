誰會在意過去? 夥計

我不太確定
Um, l'm not entirely certain

87
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:21,100
我能肯定的是你在諷刺我

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,083
查理 你想要我怎麼樣?
Charlie, what do you want from me?

89
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,700
你的發明總能成功

或受歡迎 或者兩者皆有

你不能騎在這個上...

138
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,300
我本來是想買瓶蘇達
l was actually planning on drinking it.

139
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,700
不用擔心
Well, never mind then.

140
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
你怎麼樣 維吉爾?
So, um, how are you, Virg?

141
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,700
這個暑假沒見你幾次
l didn't see you much this summer.

142
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,368
我經常去爬山
Oh, you know, l was doing a lot of mountain climbing

143
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:05,600
玩水上摩托什麼的...
jet skiing...

144
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,100
打電動?      都沒離開過沙發 你呢?
Video games?        l didn't leave the couch. You?

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,300
毫無新意乏味的聚會 啦啦隊長營地
The usual, pool parties, cheerleading camp.

146
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,600
但參加了一個很不錯建築學班
But l did take this awesome architecture class.

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,900
真不賴
Oh, that's cool.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,587
我記得你做過一個姜餅房
l remember you made a gingerbread house

149
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,300
有10個房間...
that had ten rooms...

150
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,347
還有可進入的壁櫥
And walk-in closets.

151
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:21,500
我們吃了六個月
Took us six months to eat it.

152
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,500
得去上微積分了
Well, l have calculus.

153
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,900
討厭它 需要它 想搞建築離不開它
Hate it. Need it. Can't be an architect without it.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,400
我是公共演講
l got Public Speaking.

155
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
討厭它 需要它
Hate it. Need it.

156
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,500
想當遊戲節目主持 不得不學它
Can't be a game show host without it.

157
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,900
特斯拉的傳記作者將他的書取名為
There's a good reason Tesla's biographer

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,400
《被埋沒了的天才》有充足的理由
named his book A Man Out of Time.

159
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,500
他至今比同時代
Tesla was so far advanced over his contemporaries,

160
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,000
那些經常嘲笑他的
that they often derided...

161
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,400
那些經常嘲笑他是...
...they often derided him as...

162
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,600
小姐...
Miss...

163
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,500
喬斯林
Jocelyn,

164
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,097
要你在我的課上
is it too much to ask that you

165
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:02,700
別塗指甲是不是太過分了?
not do your nails while l lecture?

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,700
不好意思 您什麼時候講完?
Sorry. When are you done?

167
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,700
打擾了      塔特爾先生
Excuse me.          Ah, Mr. Tuttle.

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,100
是來拿你的加高椅的吧
l believe you're here for your booster chair.

169
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,400
我過會兒來拿 AV俱樂部緊急事件
l'll get it later. AV Club emergency.

170
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,100
我找維吉爾·福克斯有急事兒
l need Virgil Fox right away!

171
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,900
維吉爾·福克斯?      他生病了
Virgil Fox?        He's out sick.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,181
可能不能去
l heard he might not make it.

173
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,400
真有趣 福克斯先生
Very funny, Mr. Fox.

174
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,300
你可以拿著離座證明離開
You can pick up your hall pass on your way out.

175
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,500
好吧 我這就去巴拉圭
That's it. l'm moving to Paraguay.

176
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,900
有看過我們的吉祥物嗎?
Ever really looked at our mascot?

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,900
別管那個可笑的離座證明
Forget the hall pass.

178
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,330
記得帶火箭發動裝置
Remember that rocket-propulsion

179
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,800
全地形車的事兒嗎?
all terrain cart the day of the incident?

180
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
謝謝你又說起來
Thanks for mentioning it again.

181
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,000
十分鐘前剛有人提過
lt's been ten minutes since someone brought it up.

182
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,487
這兩個有聯繫
Listen, it ties together.

183
00:09:45,014 --> 00:09:47,200
那個可能不太成功
That invention may have not been a success,

184
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,832
但其中一個元素是用的
but one element of the design was proven viable.

185
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:51,800
量子加速器
The quantum accelerator.

186
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,623
記得我在物理學 新現實
Remember that physics, new reality

187
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:55,700
各方面理論的發明嗎?
many worlds theory kick?

188
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,700
是啊 很有趣
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

189
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,900
我要在這些基礎上建立自己的理論
l started building my own theory based on all of that work,

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
來一起證明我的量子加速器假想
incorporating my proven hypothesis of quantum acceleration.

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,300
我把學校的一台電腦設為永久貯存
l put one of the school's computers on permanent reserve.

192
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,100
數字用戶回路已經開始工作了
The DSL has been doing all the work.

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,537
不久前
And moments ago

194
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:12,300
我剛解決了最後一個難題
l uploaded the last piece of the puzzle.

195
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,400
塔特爾長官 一切正常!
Commander Tuttle on the bridge!

196
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,900
夥計 別想要我跟你敬禮
Dude, no way l'm saluting you.

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,700
好吧 禮畢
Fine. At ease.

198
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,900
我要給你看的是非常
What l'm about to show you is very,

199
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,400
非常非常高度的機密
very, very top secret.

200
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
不准告訴第三個人
We have to keep this just between us.

201
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,800
看吧
Check it out.

202
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,700
怎麼了?
Yeah?

203
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,800
你看到的
What you're looking at

204
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,200
是一個成功的虛擬現實時間隧道
is a successful simulation of practical time travel.

205
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,200
你幹什麼啊?
What are you doing?

206
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,338
讓你腦子裡的東西
l'm trying to stop any more of your brain

207
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:14,900
不要從耳朵裡漏出去
from leaking out your ears.

208
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,600
什麼?
What?

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,580
拜託 你昨天說我
Come on, yesterday you said

210
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,800
應該發明點有用的東西
l should build something useful.

211
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,800
時間隧道就是有用的
Well, time travel is useful.

212
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
查理 你已經14歲了
Charlie, you're 1 4 years old.

213
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,000
兩年後就可以拿駕駛執照了
You're two years away from your driver's license,

214
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,300
卻還是把內衣褲叫"小短褲"
you still call your underwear ''underpants''.

215
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,500
我可以相信你發明了一個時光機器嗎?
l should believe you built a time machine?

216
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,939
當然 按照說明書
Yes! And based on my specifications

217
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:38,154
人們可以倒退
a person could travel up to 48 hours

218
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:40,000
48小時!     這太少了
into the past!        That's weak.

219
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,600
去你的 你時光機器能倒退多長時間?
Pardon me, how's your time travel formula coming along?

220
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,079
就像光一樣 不是嗎?
lt's all about light, right?

221
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,400
沒有運動的更快的了
Nothing moves faster.

222
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,335
假設 你可以在
Well, my hypothesis suggests that

223
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,100
一束光中進行時光穿梭
you can time travel on a beam of light.

224
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,072
從任何光源
From any light source.

225
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,900
甚至是幻燈機的光
Even light from a slide projector.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,700
幻燈機? 一個普通幻燈機?
A slide projector? Like a regular slide projector?

227
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,500
我說過普通嗎? 沒有 沒說過
Did l say regular? No, l didn't.

228
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,900
我們說的是一個複雜的
What we're talking about is a complex amalgamation

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,300
電子零件合併還有內燃力機的機器
of electronic components and internal combustion mechanics.

230
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,600
順便提一下 是你根本不瞭解的領域
Which you know nothing about, by the way.

231
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,090
得去找個搞機械的
We'll have to find a hardware guy.

232
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,200
這不是個問題
l don't see this as a problem.

233
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,300
小山雀! 在拌什麼呢?
Hey, Chickadee! What's shakin'?

234
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,979
你得原諒查理
You have to excuse Charlie.

235
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,089
女孩讓他很緊張
He's nervous around girls.

236
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,546
不 我沒有      太帥了 我喜歡害羞的男生
No, l'm not!        Oh, it's cool, l like shy boys.

237
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,079
碗裡的是什麼?
Um, what's in the bowl?

238
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,700
蛋白酥皮小餅 作業
Meringue. The assignment.

239
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
拿我的吧 我再去做一個
Here, take mine. l'll make a new one.

240
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,400
看見了嗎?      什麼?
Did you see that?        What?

241
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,500
夥計 她把蛋白酥皮小餅給你了 太棒了
Dude, she gave you meringue. That's huge.

242
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,083
我只想知道
l just need to know

243
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,400
你到底幫不幫我?
are you going to help me with this or not?

244
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,700
你是要當一個參與者 鑄就歷史
Are you gonna be part of something, make history,

245
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,600
或者是局外的被動觀察者
or sit on the sidelines and be a passive observer?

246
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
聽著 約法三章
OK, look, l'll make you a deal.

247
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,500
我幫你找一個懂機械的
l'll help with your machine and find a hardware guy.

248
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,300
但第一次試驗時
But when we try it out for the first time,

249
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,300
得用它做任何我想做的事
we use it for whatever l want to do.

250
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,600
行      好的
All right.        Right.

251
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,100
維吉爾 那個搞機械的一定要機靈
But Virgil, this hardware person we need is tricky.

252
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
為什麼?
Why?

253
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
因為他不只需要有機械上的天賦
Because he not only needs to be gifted mechanically,

254
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:25,200
還要有一定道德柔韌性
but also, let's say, require a certain moral flexibility.

255
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,300
那些生活在社會邊緣的人      好 那...
Lives on the fringes of society.        OK. Well...

256
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,000
他怎麼樣?      齊克? 你是說真的?
How about him?        Zeke? Are you serious?

257
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,400
看看他 他...他...
Look at him. He's, he's...

258
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,100
太完美了 在那些巨型卡車表演上
Perfect. You know, at those monster truck shows,

259
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
總有這個超級金屬恐龍
there's always that giant metal dinosaur

260
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,500
吸著煙火 倒騰著汽車
that breathes fire and destroys cars?

261
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,400
我看過那個廣告
l've seen the commercials

262
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,300
他和他爸爸在做這個東西
He and his dad build those.

263
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,700
殺手Saurus 顎破碎力量15,000磅
Killer-saurus. 1 5,000 pounds of jaw-crushing force!

264
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,000
瞭解!      小心 朋友們 這是食肉車!
l get it.         Look out folks, it's car-nivorous!

265
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,500
我知道了 知道了!
l get it! l get it.

266
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,200
你的貓嚇到我了
Your cat is freaking me out.

267
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,700
不是我的貓 是他的
lt's not my cat. lt's his.

268
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
他叫艾伯特 菲林斯坦因
His name is Albert Felinestein.

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,900
這是我聽過最蠢的貓名
That's the dumbest name for a cat l've ever heard.

270
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
非常贊成 齊克
Couldn't agree more, Zeke.

271
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,100
齊克斯特
Zekester.

272
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,600
我也討厭別人把名字複雜化
l hate when people bend names too.

273
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,000
像"維吉爾奧斯特" 我會說
Like ''Virgilosity.'' l'm like,

274
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,300
"少來 夥計 叫維吉爾"
''Come on, people, it's Virgil.''

275
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,100
我這就不說了
l'm going to stop talking now.

276
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,500
艾米 不! 不! 不! 這是秘密會議
Amy, no! This is a private meeting.

277
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,700
不好意思
Oh, l'm sorry.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,582
我下來看電視
l just came down to watch TV.

279
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,600
媽媽提過你有新朋友來
But Mom did mention you had a new friend over?

280
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,100
一個男生
A boy.

281
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,900
真噁心 天哪 維吉爾
Ew, he's gross! Geez, Virgil,

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,700
你就不能帶個帥哥回家?
why can't you bring home cute boys?

283
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,900
艾米 走開
Amy, leave

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,696
不然我就告訴媽媽
or l tell mom you're doing makeovers

285
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:03,494
你又給倉鼠美容
on the hamsters again.

286
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,300
真失望 這就走
Chill. l'm outta here.

287
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,600
貌似我捲進了一場骯髒的競賽
lt's like l walked into an ugly contest.

288
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,100
她還真可愛      是啊
She's a charmer.        OK.

289
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
這個東西 這個
OK, this thing, this, uh,

290
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,135
光計劃物理特質的
quantum integration to the

291
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:18,100
量子加速器
physical properties of light projection,

292
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,400
好像能行得通
looks like it could work.

293
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
是的 芒戈語
Yeah, Mongo read.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,789
好吧 你可以幫我們做嗎?
OK. So you'll help us construct it?

295
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:31,800
為什麼不?
Why not?

296
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,400
我喜歡挑戰還有免費的豆條
l'm always up for a challenge. And free bean dip.

297
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,700
你有點...
Um, you have a little...

298
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,000
不要      ...有點豆末...
No.          ...some bean...

299
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,400
再這樣 我就把你焊到城郊巴士上
Do that again and l weld you to the crosstown bus.

300
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,600
有想過我們要怎麼用它嗎?
Have you thought how we're going to use this thing?

301
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,787
第一次時光穿梭
The first journey back will

302
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,700
是一個里程碑
obviously be a monumental event

303
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,090
這次特別旅行的目標
and our specific goal on that journey

304
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,600
要適當的宏偉些
should be appropriately grandiose.

305
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,400
我知道了 兩個字 先生們:
l got it. Two words, gentlemen:

306
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,900
彩票      太好了
The lottery.        Nice.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,100
不行 維吉爾! 我拒絕同意
Absolutely not, Virgil! l refuse to agree to that.

308
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
但你早同意了
Oh, but you already did.

309
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,600
你說過只要幫你
You said that if l helped you,

310
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,900
我們可以用這個機器做我想做的任何事情
we'd use the machine for whatever l wanted to.

311
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,000
不准反悔!
No do-overs!

312
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,300
你到底想不想時間穿梭?
Do you want to time travel or don't you?

313
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
好吧      太棒了!
Fine.        Yes!

314
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,340
不會把這東西
You're not going to be able to just

315
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,400
就插牆上電源插座上吧
plug this thing into a wall outlet.

316
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
要很大的安倍數
This is gonna take major amperage.

317
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,200
還要有隱秘性和較大空間
Not to mention privacy and space.

318
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,600
我知道地方了 很棒的
l know the place. lt's perfect.

319
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
非常合適
lt's completely perfect.

320
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,500
拜託! 拜託!
Come on, come on!

321
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,100
托肯副校長
Vice Principal Tolkan,

322
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
我們需要談談開設新俱樂部的事
we need to talk about starting a new club.

323
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,580
不行
No can do.

324
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,200
我們已經沒有教室可以用了
We're completely maxed-out on classroom space.

325
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,000
美國未來黃油社團是最後一個
The Future Fonduers of America were the last ones in.

326
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
在售貨機裡的是賈斯特嗎?
ls that Chester in the vending machine?

327
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,600
夥計      誰有25美分?
Hey, fellas.        Does anyone have four quarters?

328
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,938
它不識別美元
lt's not taking my dollar.

329
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,500
你們想做些什麼嗎?
You going to do something?

330
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,338
什麼? 改變高中的運行模式?
Like what? Change the way high school works?

331
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,400
不可能 先生們
No gentlemen.

332
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
世界的一切都有本身的法則
Everything in the world has an order.

333
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,100
有人被塞進了售貨機
There are those who stuff others into vending machines,

334
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,662
有人從售貨機買東西
and those who get stuffed into vending machines.

335
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,600
就是如此運作
lt's the way the system works.

336
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,200
這些在副校長手冊裡都有
lt's in the Vice Principal's handbook.

337
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,400
不管怎麼樣 我們的俱樂部
Anyway, about our club,

338
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
我們本想...      77號教室! 我們要77號教室!
we were wondering...        Room 77! We want room 77!

339
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,200
不可能 永遠不會
lmpossible. Never gonna happen.

340
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,000
就像這個
Like this.

341
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,900
也許您可以再考慮考慮
Perhaps we can convince you to reconsider.

342
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,700
成交
Done.

343
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,829
好的 靠左一點
All right, scooch over to your left.

344
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:06,500
我要椒鹽脆餅乾
l'm going after the Pretzel Nubs.

345
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,300
我們就在
The north wing was knocked down to make the football field,

346
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,000
北面的橄欖球場下面
which we're underneath now.

347
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,343
五十年代
Room 77 was built to be

348
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:20,100
77號教室是學校貯藏室
the school's fallout shelter back in the 1 950's.

349
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,000
我想穿過這兒就是
l think it's right through here.

350
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,500
有人稱為教室改頭換面(美國同名真人秀節目)
Someone call Extreme Classroom Makeover.

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,100
一團亂
This is a disaster.

352
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,600
不過確實是個好地方
Got great bones, though.

353
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,900
好的 完工
OK! This is it.

354
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
人類的一小步
One small step for man,

355
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
是巨大的...
but one very large...

356
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,200
不 不是的 一小步...
No, that's not it. lt's one small step for...

357
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,600
夥計 快啟動啊
Dude, just turn it on.

358
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
好傢伙!
Good gravy!

359
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,900
甩呆了!      是帥呆了
Scratch!        lt's scorch.

360
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,500
是的      誰想先去?
Right.        So who wants go first?

361
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,100
成為世界第一個時光穿梭者?
Be the world's first time traveler?

362
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,900
我剛吃了一個肉塊三明治 會噎著的
l just ate a meatball sandwich. l might get cramps.

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,600
是啊 這是我最喜歡的新T恤
Yeah and um... this is my new favorite shirt.

364
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,900
拿上護目鏡
Get the goggles.

365
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,000
好的 你太合適了      來吧 別咬
OK, you're good.        Come on, no biting.

366
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,200
好的      好了
OK.         OK.

367
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,300
艾伯特·菲林斯坦因在哪兒?
Where's Albert Felinestein?

368
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,200
你們...?
Did you...?

369
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,500
喂? 漩渦! 他會死的!
Hello? Vortex! He could die!

370
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,500
我進去你就滿意了 什麼...
You were OK with me going in there. What...

371
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,000
但我正要...      抓住了!
But l was gonna...         Hang on!

372
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,600
哇 穿梭貓
Whoa, a catsicle!

373
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,900
維吉爾 時光穿梭時
Virgil, time travel is unpredictable.

374
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,100
溫度有很大的變數!
The temperatures can be highly variable!

375
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
兄弟們? 看看表
Guys? Take a look at the watch.

376
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,100
8:43
8:43.

377
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,100
8:44
8:44.

378
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,600
整整差一分鐘 這就是說...
An exact one-minute differential. That means...

379
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,500
你的貓是歷史上第一個時光穿梭者!
Your cat is the first time-traveler in history!

380
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,600
我們成功了!
We did it!

381
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,100
太奇怪了
Huh. That's bizarre.

382
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,884
薩莫頓高中有情況
l've got a reading from the Summerton sensor

383
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,324
出現很多圖表
pretty much off the charts,

384
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,700
但周圍什麼也沒有
but nothing around it. Hmm.

385
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,200
他們樓裡有什麼東西?
You think they got anything on that upstairs?

386
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,600
不能 有問題他們肯定會打電話的
Nah, they would've called right away.

387
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
可能是一些電腦小故障
Probably another computer glitch.

388
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,400
他們給我們這些住地下室的提供很傻逼的器械
They give us basement dwellers the lame-o equipment.

389
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
加上滿樓好吃的零食
Plus all the good snacks are upstairs.

390
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,700
我很嚴肅 嘗嘗這個 好像壞了
l mean, seriously, try one of these, they're stale.

391
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,600
斯蒂芬 我要怎樣你才能相信?
Steph, what do l have to do to make you believe me?

392
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
她只是教我法語
She's just teaching me French.

393
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,083
喬斯林·李 給你當法語家教
Hmm, Jocelyn Lee is tutoring you in French

394
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,800
就這樣?
and that's all?

395
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
瞧 這就是為什麼需要她的幫助
See, that's why l need her help.

396
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,300
我根本不懂你說什麼
I have no idea what you said.

397
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,600
我說"我的男朋友是個說謊的弱智"
l said, ''My boyfriend is a lying cheesebrain.''

398
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,700
別這樣 斯蒂芬
Come on, Steph,

399
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,200
喬斯林很性感 但卻是個低等的進食者
Jocelyn's hot but she's a total bottom feeder.

400
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,800
我不會再過去了
l would never go there.

401
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
知道了      待會打電話給你 行了?
l know.         l'll call you later, OK?

402
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
好的
OK.

403
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,000
沒看見你在這兒      你好
Oh, Steph, l didn't see you there.         Oh, hey.

404
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,988
在學習?
You studying?

405
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:22,100
我在找卷筆刀
l was looking for a pencil sharpener.

406
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,300
我這兒有
Oh, l have one.

407
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,400
你有鉛筆嗎?
Do you have a pencil?

408
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,900
老樣子 維吉爾 一點沒變
Same old Virg. Never changes.

409
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,700
你也沒怎麼變
Well, you haven't changed much either.

410
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,830
跑過澆水管
Does your hair still frizz up

411
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,700
你頭髮還會是一團亂?
when you run through the sprinkler?

412
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,100
當然 早上來學校前
Totally. This morning before school

413
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
我還在草坪上裝了個膠水管
l set up the Wiggly Worm on the lawn...

414
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,100
我喜歡膠水管
l love the Wiggly Worm.

415
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,800
還記得那次我差點淹死了嗎?
Remember that time l almost drowned?

416
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,200
因為德裡克把噴頭對著你鼻子
Because Derek shoved the nozzle up your nose.

417
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,337
他拚命的跑
He tried to run away

418
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:46,000
頭還撞了電話線桿
and cracked his head on the telephone pole.

419
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,500
真想那時的我們      三個好朋友
l miss us.         Tres amigos.

420
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,400
是啊
Yeah.

421
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,582
你知道嗎
You know

422
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:03,000
德裡克盡力去阻止那些橄欖球員了
Derek really did try to stop those football players.

423
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,700
但他們是高年級的
But you know how seniors are.

424
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,591
無論如何
Anyway

425
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:08,000
他對那天的事很難過
l know he feels bad about what happened that day.

426
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,582
他們說
You know, they say that

427
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:12,800
放不下過去的人死的更快
people who don't let go of the past die faster.

428
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,800
會有更多的痛苦
And get more acne.

429
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,700
我汗流浹背了
l'm sweating like five hogs.

430
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,588
因為氣溫的變化不定
Due to irregularities in temperature

431
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:25,900
我們應該準備好
we should be prepared.

432
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,400
我們就在這兒買彩票吧
OK, l got the winning lottery numbers right here.

433
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,587
為了保證我們回來時
To guarantee that the vortex maintains

434
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:33,700
漩渦能保持平穩
stability long enough to return safely,

435
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,600
我們只有10分鐘的時間
we only have ten minutes on the other side.

436
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,100
否則 會引發爆炸
Otherwise, we run the risk of exploding.

437
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,900
有趣 還以為你說的是爆炸
That's funny, l thought you said exploding.

438
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,800
是說了 放射性網絡
l did. Activating grid...

439
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,300
帶著鉤子幹什麼?
Um... what's with the grappling hook?

440
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
你嘲笑這鉤子?
You making fun of the hook?

441
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,100
什麼? 不 不是 喜歡 喜歡這鉤子
What? No, no. Love, love the hook.

442
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,300
下一站...新式小鎮
Next stop... funky town.

443
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,600
想起來 我忘了 檢查三次...
l just remembered. l forgot to triple check the...

444
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,600
我們可以商量商量這個嗎?
Can we talk about this?

445
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,100
要改進我們著陸的地方
We gotta work on our landings.

446
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,900
昨天1 :27 我們成功了
1 :27 yesterday. We did it.

447
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,800
是啊 成功了 我們是時光穿梭者
Oh yes, we did it. We're time travelers.

448
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,300
我們是時光穿梭者 我們是時光穿梭者
We're time travelers We're time travelers

449
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,100
我們是時光 我們是時光
We're time, we're time,

450
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,100
我們是時光 我們是時光 我們是時光穿梭者
we're time we're time, we're time travelers

451
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,300
我們是時光穿梭者      他還正常吧?
We're time travelers        ls he OK?

452
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,300
他真的很熱愛科學
He really loves science.

453
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
我們是時光穿梭者 我們是時光穿梭者
We're time travelers We're time travelers

454
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,300
買一張彩票 這是數字
One lottery ticket, please. These are the numbers.

455
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,200
我們感到很幸運
We're feeling lucky.

456
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,833
你覺得你有身份證嗎?
Are you feeling like you have l.D.?

457
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:44,700
買彩票必須要滿18歲
You need to be 1 8 to buy a lottery ticket.

458
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,700
我們需要你幫個忙
Hi. We need to ask you a favor.

459
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,500
他想要小費
He wants a tip.

460
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,000
放這了
Here, OK.

461
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,088
想要你替我們買張彩票
We need you to buy us a lottery ticket

462
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,700
這是號碼
with these numbers.

463
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,400
你覺得怎麼樣?
What do you say?

464
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,300
給小費
Tip him.

465
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,100
我就這些了 行嗎?
lt's all l got, OK?

466
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,579
夥計們 夥計們
You guys. You guys!

467
00:28:21,614 --> 00:28:23,800
我們還有兩分鐘時間回學校
We have two minutes to get back to school!

468
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,700
新方案 明天12點這兒見
New plan. We'll meet you here tomorrow at 1 2:00.

469
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
到時要拿好彩票 行嗎?
Hang on to the ticket till then, OK?

470
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,200
好的
OK.

471
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,680
第二次波動
OK, that's the second fluctuation

472
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,194
同一大小
of the same exact magnitude,

473
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,900
同一地點
at the same exact location.

474
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,000
告訴你了 是技術故障而已
l'm telling you, it's a technical glitch.

475
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,600
還有可能是什麼?
What else could it be?

476
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,334
你覺得他們突然
You think they all of a sudden started

477
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,000
drilling for oil in Summerton?
在薩莫頓挖油?

478
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,500
回去做自己的事兒吧
Now, let's just get back to work, all right?

479
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,700
能幫我把這個解開嗎?
Can you help me un-knot this?

480
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
太帥了 不敢相信他贏了
Cool. l can't believe he won.

481
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,000
今天下午一個令人難以置信的故事
An incredible story from Summerton this afternoon.

482
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,900
昨晚公佈州立彩票的贏家
The winner of the State Lottery, announced last night,

483
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,900
就是這個機器人
has turned out to be none other than Robot Man.

484
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,800
告訴過你了
Told you.

485
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,084
好吧 明天我們再回來
OK, so tomorrow we go back in time

486
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,600
買一張新的
and get a new lottery ticket.

487
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,300
不過這次我們得保證...      不行
But this time, we be sure...         No.

488
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
維吉爾 這是不對的
Virgil, it's wrong.

489
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,600
這是作弊
lt's cheating.

490
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,800
你說的對 就是作弊
You're right. lt is cheating.

491
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,600
新方案
New plan.

492
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,900
我們在電視上給它打廣告 做電視導購
We go on TV with the machine, do an infomercial,

493
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,800
賣8000台 我們就會有源源不斷的財富
sell like 8,000 of them and instantly become rich

494
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
受大眾追捧
and humongously popular!

495
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
他們說你不能買到幸福
And they say you can't buy happiness.

496
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,835
聽著
Listen to me.

497
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:52,700
要是有其他人發現了這個時光機
lf anyone finds out about this time machine

498
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,100
那時就是我 你 還有齊克的末日
it will be the end of me, you, and Zeke.

499
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,500
末日!
The end!

500
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,100
你能轉過身去嗎? 我不喜歡和人近距離接觸
Can you back up? l have personal space issues.

501
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,500
不
Oh, no.

502
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,600
思維不要被局限了
Think outside the box.

503
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,800
這個機器有很大的用處
There's an important use for the machine.

504
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,700
有什麼比財富和名氣還重要?
What's more important than being rich and popular?

505
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,300
開玩笑! 我在開玩笑 本來就是
Kidding! l'm kidding... mostly.

506
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,900
賈斯特 在找這個啊
Hey, Chester. Looking for these?

507
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,700
把衣服還我
Hey, gimme those!

508
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,085
要是你想試試新形象
lf you're trying out a new look

509
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,228
老實說 不怎麼樣
let me say it's not working.

510
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,657
那些人偷了我衣服
Those kids stole my clothes.

511
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:57,200
能幫我拿回來嗎?
Can you help me get them back?

512
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,700
很樂意 真的 我會的
l'd like to. Really, l would.

513
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,089
但這意味著
But that would mean altering

514
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,700
改變學校規範制度
the delicate social system at the school.

515
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,700
祝你好運
So... good luck.

516
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,500
維吉爾 我有個好主意
Virgil, l just had a brilliant idea.

517
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,100
你是說用時光機...      沒錯
You mean use the time machine to...         Exactly.

518
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,400
呆瓜!      再來一次 是帥呆了
Starch!        Again, scorch.

519
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
你有讀過我郵給你的指導書嗎?
Did you read the instructions l e-mailed you?

520
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
對不起
l'm sorry.

521
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,800
好的 直接點
OK, so let me get this straight.

522
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,800
你是說我們做無名英雄?
You're saying we become like silent heroes

523
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,400
一點都不酷?      看看周圍
to the un-cool?        Look around.

524
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,100
我們可以用幾分鐘
We live in a world where mere minutes

525
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,500
改變整個未來
can make or break a person's entire future.

526
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,085
想想 高一發生了什麼?
Take what happened freshman year.

527
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,400
它毀了我的生活
Had l known it would ruin my life,

528
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,342
我本不該這樣做
l never would've done it.

529
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,300
這是你真實想法嗎?
Tell us how you really feel?

530
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,839
想想學校裡所有
Think about all the kids at this school

531
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:56,300
像賈斯特 像我們的孩子
like Chester, like us.

532
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,100
我們生活在長期的恐懼羞辱中
We all live in constant fear of humiliation,

533
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,078
因為我們偶然的成為弱小
because we happen to be smaller

534
00:32:01,262 --> 00:32:02,700
不融洽之類的
less coordinated, whatever.

535
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,500
但我們可以改變
But we can change that.

536
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,085
一分鐘人要用他們的力量
The Minutemen must use their powers

537
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,500
來維護真理與正義
for truth and justice.

538
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,700
接下來我們就可以集中注意力賺錢了
And then we focus on getting rich.

539
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,900
我在開玩笑
Again, l'm kidding.

540
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,200
誰是一分鐘人?      我們 我們就是
And who are the Minutemen?        We. Us.

541
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,000
及時的出現在重要的時刻
The all-important minutes in time.

542
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,200
很聰明 對吧?      確實
Clever, right?         Sort of.

543
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,500
不覺得
Not really.

544
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,339
別管這個
Forget it!

545
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:36,200
這些遙控器沒一個好用
None of these remote control hookups are gonna work.

546
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,700
這個一點也不好
This is no good.

547
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,200
要調整調整 我們得準時回來
We have to make adjustments while we're back in time.

548
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,000
那 我們其中一個得留下來
Well, then, l guess one of us is going to hang back.

549
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,900
不要!      不要
Not it!         Not it.

550
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,200
不要! 去你的!
Not it! Aww! Dang it!

551
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,900
這不公平 我發明了這個機器      好吧
Unfair, l invented the machine.         OK.

552
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,900
再來一次 不要!      不要!
Re-do. Not it!        Not it!

553
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,300
不要! 去你的!
Not it! Double dang it!

554
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,700
不要! 這個真有趣
Not it! That was fun.

555
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,800
不要!      珍妮特你來這兒幹什麼?
Not it!        Uh, Jeanette, what are you doing here?

556
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,900
我想參加一個俱樂部 我看見你們的了
l was looking for a club to join and l saw yours.

557
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,700
"回到過去俱樂部"      是啊
''The Back To The Future Fan Club.''        Oh, right.

558
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,100
我喜歡這電影 雖然我沒看過
l love that movie, even though l never really saw it.

559
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,300
但我很喜歡時間穿梭這主意
But l totally love the idea of time travel.

560
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,400
這個非常...科幻
l mean, it's just so... science fiction-y.

561
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,900
珍妮特 來的正巧
Actually Jeanette, your timing is interesting.

562
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,300
不 不行 維吉爾 你想怎麼樣?
No, it isn't, Virgil. What are you doing?

563
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,800
抱歉
Uh... Excuse us.

564
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,100
會一團亂的...
Shh!        lt's gonna mess up...

565
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,200
不行 不行 不行!      聽我說
No, no, no!         Listen to me.

566
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,900
不行 不行 不行      想想會發生什麼
No, no, no.        Think about what's going on.

567
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,800
好了
OK.

568
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,200
珍妮特請坐
Jeanette, have a seat.

569
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:08,800
是的 善知鳥
Sure thing, Puffin.

570
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,000
但先...
Um... but first...

571
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,300
我們得換套裝束
We so have to do something about those outfits.

572
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,900
去吧 好了不少
There you go. That's better.

573
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,096
你從哪兒弄的啊?
Where did you get these?

574
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,800
我爸爸在滑冰世界買的
My Dad just bought Ski World.

575
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,477
很幸運?
How lucky is that?

576
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:32,600
要是他還有一個蝦仁華夫小屋
lf he still owned The Shrimp 'n Waffle Hut

577
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,500
那真是棒的不可救藥
that would be like, no help at all.

578
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,300
我正在找要穿什麼呢
l've been looking for something form-fitting

579
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,500
能夠聚焦這些大型的槍支
that would highlight these massive guns.

580
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,838
你看上去像個吉娃娃
You're built like a chihuahua.

581
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:44,100
你看起來像個雪人
You look like a yeti.

582
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,759
你以為我不知道雪人是什麼樣?
You think l don't know what a yeti is?

583
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:46,340
你知道嗎?
Do you?

584
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,247
維吉爾快長大吧
Virgil, grow up.

585
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,654
我 長大? 你才要長大!
Me, grow up? You grow up!

586
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,515
不要吼查理!
Don't yell at Charlie!

587
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:51,018
我沒有!你不要吼
l'm not! You stop yelling!

588
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,500
我從來不對其他人大喊大叫
l never yell at people.

589
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:55,700
不要吵了!
Stop yelling!

590
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,400
沒想過時光穿梭會這麼吵
l never thought time travel would involve so much bickering.

591
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,000
哦 天哪
Oh, man!

592
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,700
站著別動 夥計
Hold it right there, friend.

593
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,518
要是想戲弄我
Uh, if you guys are gonna pick on me

594
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,399
你們得拿號碼牌了
you'll have to take a number.

595
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,500
不要害怕      我們來幫助你
Don't be afraid.        We're here to help.

596
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,500
怎麼了 夥計?
What's going on, fellas?

597
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,200
那個你拿著吧 我有新衣服了
Oh, you can keep those. l got myself some new threads.

598
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,100
穿雪衣的小子是誰啊?
Who were those snowsuit guys?

599
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,600
經過二十年的服務
After twenty years of service

600
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,800
董事會會給你金錶或者其中任何一個
the board gives you either a gold watch or one of these.

601
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,900
我可愛的小城堡
My sweet little castle.

602
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,823
不要碰
Don't touch it.

603
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:01,899
等裝好防彈玻璃罩後要放進我辦公室的
lt's going in my office in a bulletproof glass case.

604
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,700
它很柔弱
lt's delicate.

605
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,600
我們贏了嗎? 我們贏了嗎?
Did we win? Did we win?

606
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,600
我們贏了 非常成功
Oh, we won all right. We won big.

607
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
瑞切特護士 鮑勃教練
Nurse Ratchett and Coach Bob

608
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,800
曾見過 他們確認這不會傳染
have seen it before and they assure me it's not contagious.

609
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,800
在我們結束今天早上的廣播前 還有一件事
One more thing, before we wrap up this morning's announcements.

610
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,900
最近有一群學生穿著雪衣
Recently, a group of students dressed in snowsuits,

611
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,900
干擾體育課
disrupted a gym class.

612
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,600
更重要的是 毀壞了我珍惜的透視模型
More importantly, they destroyed my precious diorama.

613
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,800
不管是誰 我明確聲明
Whoever you students are, let me make it perfectly clear

614
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:58,500
一旦查出你們的身份 會受到嚴肅處理
that once you are identified, you will be severely punished.

615
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,800
就到這裡
That is all.

616
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,100
太酷了 我們成了綠林好漢
Cool. We're outlaws.

617
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,300
警察在追捕我們      淘氣的內德
On the run from Johnny Law.         Naughty Neds.

618
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,300
我忘用牙線潔牙 媽媽就會這麼說我
That's what my mom calls me when l forget to floss.

619
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,800
很好 不過我覺得這是垂懸分詞
Perfect, except l think that's a dangling participle.

620
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,100
我討厭這些東西垂懸
l hate it when those things dangle.

621
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,000
等五分鐘 行嗎?
Pick up in five minutes, OK?

622
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,800
我真的很累 我想坐下來歇歇
l'm totally tired and need to sit down.

623
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,000
你可以拿點吃的來嗎?
You think maybe you could just bring the food to our table?

624
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,100
你懂的 違反點紀律
You know, bend the rules just a little bit?

625
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,100
尤金·梵·霍則伯格
Eugene von Hoserberg.

626
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,100
好吧     太棒了
Uh... You bet.         Great.

627
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,200
懂了嗎?
So, do you think you get it?

628
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,100
是的
Um... yeah.

629
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,300
這就來...
Here you go...

630
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,500
真不錯 笨豬
Nice one, dork.

631
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
中彩了 尤金
Way to go, Eugene.

632

尤金·梵·霍則伯格

633
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,500

Uh... You bet.         Great.

634
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,000
來吧      好樣的! 雪衣小子!
Here you go.        All right! The Snowsuit Guys!

635
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,200
好樣的! 雪衣小子!
All right, the Snowsuit guys.

636
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,200
太棒了 雪衣小子!
Way to go, Snow Guys.

637
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,700
恭喜啊 尤金
Way to go, Eugene.

638
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,000
到此為止 滑雪俱樂部! 或者我該說
The jig is up, Ski Club! Or should l say...

639
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,100
雪衣小子?
...Snowsuit Guys?

640
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,200
是啊 我總是跟他們一起聚會
Yeah, l party with them all the time.

641
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,800
你們說的是誰? 尤金
Who's this we're talking about, Eugene?

642
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,600
維吉爾 不是別人
Oh, hey, Virgil. Yeah, it's nobody you know.

643
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,900
我在說雪衣小子
l'm just talking about the Snowsuit Guys.

644
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,300
是啊 我聽說過他們
Oh, yeah, l heard about them.

645
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:16,100
他們簡直是真正的英雄
They're supposed to be total heroes.

646
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,300
我聽說那個中等身材的小伙子非常幽默
Oh, and l hear the medium height guy, is extremely hilarious

647
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,500
相當英俊...
and devastatingly handsome...

648
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,000
他們叫一分鐘人 不是雪衣小子
And they're called the Minutemen, not the Snowsuit Guys!

649
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,700
有人注意尤金的態度嗎?
Anyone notice that Eugene has copped an attitude?

650
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,900
態度? 看看賈斯特吧
You want attitude, check out Chester.

651
00:41:34,935 --> 00:41:37,600
是我引領的潮流嗎? 你告訴我吧 夥計
Am l a trend setter? You tell me, amigo.

652
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,252
這些小子
l mean, who else are these kids

653
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:41,599
都跟著誰的風格?
supposed to look up to to set trends?

654
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,200
那人蠢人?
Those doorknobs?

655
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,700
維吉爾? 維吉爾 維吉爾!
Virgil? Virgil, Virgil!

656
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,100
我本想昨晚給你打電話 但還是親自告訴你吧
l almost called you, but l wanted to tell you in person.

657
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,800
什麼? 怎麼了?      貝爾蒙大學錄取我了!
What? What's going on?        l got accepted into UC Belmont!

658
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
太棒了!
Get out!

659
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,724
但還不完全如此
But it's not a done deal yet.

660
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,499
我在申請啦啦隊長獎學金
l applied for a cheerleading scholarship.

661
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,800
他們派來一個調查員
They're sending a scout,

662
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,300
我得努力做好我的金字塔下馬
which means l have to work on my pyramid dismount.

663
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,500
太酷了 我為你高興 你喜歡那個學校
That's so cool! l'm so psyched for you! You love that school!

664
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,100
斯蒂芬!      德裡克
Steph!        Oh, Derek.

665
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,100
我得去告訴他獎學金的事兒
Oh.        Gotta tell him about the scholarship.

666
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,900
待會兒見 維吉爾 拜拜
So, l'll see you later, Virg. Bye.

667
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,500
查理 怎麼了?
Charlie, what's wrong?

668
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,956
關於時光機
OK, there's something l haven't told you

669
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:28,699
我有些沒有告訴你們
about the time travel formula.

670
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,122
記得有一個困擾我幾年的
Remember there was one last piece of

671
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:32,715
最後一個方程式
the equation that evaded me for years

672
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,500
直到我日以繼夜的
until l found what l was looking for

673
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,300
通過因特網下載程序才解開
through a round-the-clock internet downloading procedure.

674
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
他非法進入數據庫?      還要糟糕
He was hacking.        lt gets worse.

675
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,500
我從NASA偷的      你搶了NASA?
l stole it from NASA.         You robbed NASA?

676
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,108
沒有聽上去那麼糟糕
lt's not as bad as it sounds.

677
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:53,199
不 比聽上去的還要糟糕
Yes, it's worse than it sounds.

678
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,400
那些是六十年代的 他們已經無效了
The files were from the 1 960s, they were defunct.

679
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,310
幾十年沒人碰過了
No one has touched them for decades.

680
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,434
這很糟 非常糟
This is bad, real bad.

681
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,400
我們可能會進監獄      你知道
We could go to prison.        Just so you know,

682
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
要是我們坐牢了 得用一個牢房
if we do go to prison, and we share the same cell,

683
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,100
我鼾聲就像拉鋸一樣
l snore like a chain saw.

684
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,000
很好      這不是問題
Great.        This won't be a problem

685
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,200
只要我們一段時間不用這個機器 潛伏起來
as long as we don't use the machine for awhile and lay low.

686
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,100
弄掉了一顆葡萄
Mmm, l dropped a grape.

687
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,700
怎麼會這樣?
So, how did it happen?

688
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,052
別想了 斯蒂芬妮
Forget it. lt's terrible Stephanie

689
00:43:46,152 --> 00:43:47,799
從金字塔上摔下來確實很糟糕
fell off the top of the pyramid.

690
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,712
但別想了
But forget it.

691
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:52,499
我們都被監視了 對吧
l mean, we all said that we were being watched, right?

692
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,100
都火燒眉毛了
The heat is on.

693
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,200
要是我們不幫斯蒂芬妮 她會失去獎學金的
lf we don't help Stephanie she could lose out on her scholarship.

694
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,600
我們得回去      因為你暗戀她!
We have to go back.        'Cause you have a creepy crush on her!

695
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,400
暗戀? 我也這麼認為
Oh! Creepy crush. l vote yes!

696
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,737
查理 說說你自己
Charlie, you said it yourself

697
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:06,199
非法搞到的過期文件
the files you hacked into were defunct.

698
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,400
我保證沒有人知道他們失蹤了
l'll bet nobody knows they're missing.

699
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,200
需要我再提醒你一次嗎?
Need l remind you?

700
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,900
我們是一分鐘人 不是 膽小人
We are the Minutemen, not the Weeniemen.

701
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,400
晚飯前回來哦!
Don't be late for dinner!

702
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,400
我們得計劃一下
OK, we need a plan of action.

703
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,862
我們必須非常小心
We've got to be extremely discreet.

704
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:48,699
勇敢和果斷
And bold and decisive.

705
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,600
齊克 你怎麼想?      他去哪兒了?
Zeke, what do you think?        Where'd he go?

706
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,500
齊克?      他去哪兒了?
Zeke?        Where'd he go?

707
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,900
至少我們有了勇敢和果斷
At least we got the bold and decisive part.

708
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,500
衝啊 衝啊 衝啊!
Go, go, go!

709
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,300
回來! 快
Come back here! Come on.

710
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
雪衣小子
Snowsuit Guys.

711
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,500
怎麼了 尤金      夥計 我能一塊來玩兒嗎?
What's up, Gene.        Hey, dudes. Mind if l hack in?

712
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,700
站住 不准動!
Stop! Hold it right there!

713
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,000
加油 公羊!
Go Rams! Whoo!

714
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,500
接的真準!
Good catch!

715
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,600
我不知道你是誰 但真讓人驚訝
l don't know who you are, but you're amazing.

716
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,100
少來
Get out.

717
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,300

719
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,000
真棒!      雪衣小子!
All right!         Yeah! Snowsuit Guys!

720
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,500
我們叫一分鐘人!
And we're called the Minutemen!

721
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,900
根據我的計算 你們都跟我的風
According to my calculations, you guys are in my way.

722
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,600
少管我們 賈斯特      我不喜歡你的帽子
Leave us alone, Chester.          l'm not fond of your hat.

723
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,796
打擾了 這裡怎麼了?
Excuse me, what is going on here?

724
00:46:41,962 --> 00:46:43,999
賈斯特總騷擾我們
Chester keeps harassing us.

725
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,800
閉嘴 混蛋      都靜一下
Shut up, dirtball.         Everyone, settle down.

726
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,214
賈斯特我記得
Chester, last l remember

727
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:50,805
你是食物鏈的最底層
you were at the bottom of the food chain

728
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,162
我不能忍受學生
and l will not tolerate students

729
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,999
蛙跳到高等階層
leapfrogging to a higher social status.

730
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,800
跟我來
So you come with me.

731
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,500
要公羊角報嗎?      謝謝
The Ram's Horn?        Thanks.

732
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,200
不客氣      我要一份?
Sure.        can l have one?

733
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,500
"機器人控告老太太" 維吉爾 這很糟糕
''Robot Man Sues Old Lady''?         Virgil, this is bad.

734
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,300
我們改變了沒有料到的事物發展的後果
We are changing the outcome of things we never planned on.

735
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,900
我們的改變造成了連續反應      那又怎麼樣?
Our jumps cause a chain reaction.        How so?

736
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,200
賈斯特陷入困境 這在之前是不可能發生的
Chester getting in trouble. That's never happened before.

737
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,000
機器人控告老太太? 世界都瘋了
Robot men suing old ladies?  lt's a world gone mad!

738
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,100
就像我說的一樣 瘋了
Mad l tell you!

739
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,800
全球變暖 讓他很抓狂
Global warming. He's really freaked out.

740
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,700
需要幫忙嗎?
Hey, you, uh, need a hand?

741

斯蒂芬
Uh... Steph.

不 不用了
Um, not, not really.

743
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
你來有...?      只是看看我能做什麼
What are you...?         l figure it's the least l can do,

744
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,100
來感謝你      為什麼?
to thank you.         For what?

745
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,100
你救了我 雪衣小子
For saving me. Snowsuit Guy.

746
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,500
什麼? 不是 不是 不是      不要這樣 維吉爾
What? Oh, no, no, no.         Oh, don't even try it, Virg.

747
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,400
"少來" 拜託
''Get out?'' Please.

748
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,700
你 查理 齊克·湯普森
You, Charlie, and Zeke Thompson

749

我知道 這太帥了
l knew it! That is so cool!

751
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:10,599
我想想就發現了
l figured it out because l started thinking.

752
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,617
你們會在壞事發生之前
The kids you helped

753
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:13,299
幫助那些孩子
it was before something bad was about to happen,

754
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,000
比如我那件事兒      太可笑了
like with me.        That is ridiculous.

755
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,100
我們怎麼能知道壞事什麼時候會發生?
How are we gonna know when something bad is gonna happen?

756
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
這就是我問自己的
That's exactly what l asked myself.

757
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,000
我想了又想
l thought about it and l thought about it.

758
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,200
然後就知道了      不 你不知道
Then l figured it out.         No, you didn't.

759
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,500
是的 我知道了      不
Yes, l did.        No.

760
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,300
不可能知道      承認吧 維吉爾
You couldn't have.         Admit it, Virgil.

761
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,800
你 查理 還有 齊克...
You, Charlie and Zeke...

762
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,300
是巫師      時光穿梭者?
...are psychic.         Time travelers?

763
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,300
什麼? 有人說"時光穿梭者"嗎?
What? Who said ''time travelers''?

764
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,600
不 這太瘋狂了 不可能      少來!
No, that's crazy. We're psychic.         Get out!

765
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,100
我們是巫師 我聽你說的...是的 不會吧 不會吧 不
We're psychic. l heard you...          No, no, no.

766
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,900
維吉爾 你說時光穿梭者
Virgil, you said time travel.

767
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:47,600
喔 上帝 酷斃了 你怎麼弄的?
Oh my gosh, cool! How do you do it? Huh? Huh?

768
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,800
準備!
Down!

769
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,500
暫停!
Time out!

770
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,400
這場城郊比賽還剩7秒
Six seconds left in this match of crosstown rivals.

771
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,836
黃蜂在第四節
The Hornets cling to a four-point lead

772
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,899
領先薩莫頓四分
coming on fourth and goal for Summerton.

773
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,700
橄欖球 再說一遍為什麼我們在這裡
Football. Remind me why we're here again.

774
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,900
因為一些人總會在這時候讓自己丟臉
'Cause some kid always embarrasses himself at these things.

775
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,900
睜著眼睛看就行
Just keep your eyes open.

776
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,200
我真的很聰明
You know, l'm actually very bright.

777
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,200
還有很多人都覺得我是蓬勃異常
Even though a lot of people see me as sputty.

778
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,000
蓬勃異常?      就是生氣蓬勃而且頭腦異常
Sputty?        A cross between spunky and nutty.

779
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,500
很好
Great.

780
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,400
聽著 保 一切都在你手中 但不要有壓力
Listen, Beau, it's all in your hands, but no pressure.

781
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,200
行嗎? 別想還剩六秒鐘
All right? Forget that there's six seconds left on the clock.

782
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,600
別想你可能讓薩莫頓高中出現在地圖上
Forget that you could put Summerton High on the map.

783
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,900
別想我的小兒子在人群裡
Forget my little boy is up there in the stands,

784
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,500
看著他的爸爸努力實現畢生的夢想
looking down on his father trying to fulfill a lifelong dream

785
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,600
獲得全州冠軍 什麼都別想
of winning a state championship. Forget about all that.

786
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,900
我只想要你...
What l want is you...

787

The Hornets win! What a heartbreaker for Summerton.

799
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,240
我早知道你會有大成就的 維吉爾
l always knew you were gonna do big things, Virg

800
00:50:52,365 --> 00:50:53,699
時光穿梭對吧?
but time travel?

801
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,000
真是難以置信 兄弟
That's whacked out, man.

802
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,600
一 二 三 四 你的球隊臭名揚永遠不得分
One, two, three, four Your team stinks. You'll never score!

803
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,900
艾米...      五 六 七 八
Amy...         Five six seven eight

804
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,612
你不可能追上 我很棒
You can't touch this. l'm too great.

805
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:04,299
艾米夠了 上樓
Amy, that's it. Upstairs!

806
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,700
斯蒂芬妮 我都沒看到過你 你來真是太奇怪了
Stephanie, l didn't even see you. lt's so weird that you're here.

807
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,600
天哪 德裡克·保加?
And oh my gosh, Derek Beaugard?

808
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,300
你是最棒的橄欖球運動員...
You are like the best football player ever...

809
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,400
...除了昨天的失算的比賽
...except for that blown play yesterday.

810
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,100
快走 艾米看動畫片去      不要
Just go. Amy, go watch cartoons.        No.

811
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,700
真的很不好意思
l'm so, so sorry.

812
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,700
我向爸媽爭取沒人時 把她給關籠子裡
l'm trying to talk my folks into caging her when there's company.

813
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,500
她太可愛了
She's so cute.

814
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,800
那...
Oh. So, um...

815
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,635
關於昨天的比賽 維吉爾
About the game yesterday, Virg.

816
00:51:33,782 --> 00:51:36,199
對德裡克來說非常重要
That was a really big deal for Derek.

817
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,000
他感到讓整所學校都失望了
He feels like he let everybody in school down.

818
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,511
我本該贏了那場比賽
l would've won that game.

819
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,499
賈斯特突然裸奔球場
Chester streaked across the field

820
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,100
分散了他注意力      那些笨豬都中了什麼邪?
and distracted him.         What's gotten into all the dorks?

821
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,200
都忘了自己的陣型
lt's like they just don't know their place anymore.

822
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,279
你們想讓一分鐘人
So you guys want the Minutemen

823
00:51:52,438 --> 00:51:55,299
來阻止賈斯特干擾球賽?
to stop Chester from interfering with the game?

824
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,700
不是 我們想讓你們做
Uh, no, man. We want you guys to do it.

825
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,900
誰是... 一分鐘人?
Who are the... Minutemen?

826
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
我們
That's us.

827
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,300
沒關係
Never mind.

828
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,000
我不知道
So, uh...        l don't know.

829
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,500
查理很難搞定      拜託了 維吉爾
Charlie's gonna be a tough sell.        Come on, Virg.

830
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,521
我知道我們不會再說
l know we never really talked about

831
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:16,499
高一那年的事兒了
what went down that day, freshman year.

832
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,800
事實是 我盡力去阻止他們了 但卻沒用
But the thing is, l tried to stop them. lt was a raw deal, man.

833
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,700
我希望你和我能回到過去
l wish you and l could get back to how we used to be.

834
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,000
哥們關係
Always chillin'.

835
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,100
你怎麼想? 兄弟
What do you say, man?

836
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,400
帥呆了!
Scorch!

837
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,800
真不敢相信 德裡克 這麼對你 你還幫他?
l can't believe you want to help Derek after what he did to you?

838
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,300
這麼對我們?      可能跟我們想的不一樣
Did to us?        lt didn't happen the way we think.

839
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,004
何況 都過了很長時間了
And besides, it's time to move on.

840
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:55,599
我已經做了一些測試
l've been running some tests.

841
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,952
我們的時光穿梭已經損害了
We might be damaging the space-time

842
00:52:58,105 --> 00:52:59,599
空間時間的連續性
continuum with our time travel.

843
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,598
這對我們的未來
That could have serious consequences

844
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:04,199
甚至整個星球都會有嚴重影響
to our future or even the planet.

845
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,800
德裡克的比賽會這樣都是我們的錯
What happened to Derek in that game was our fault.

846
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,100
間接      他說的對 笑翠鳥
lndirectly.        He's right, Kookaburra.

847
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,700
在你從衣櫥裡就了他之後
Chester's a different person

848
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,200
賈斯特就變成了另外一個人
after you rescued him in the locker.

849
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,800
說到重點      是我做的嗎?
Excellent point.         ls it me,

850
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,600
還是我讓這個計劃失去控制?
or have l totally lost control of this project?

851
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,800
失去控制 兄弟
Lost control, bro.

852
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,900
對不起 我遲了
Sorry l'm late.

853
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,000
放射網絡
Activating grid.

854
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,100
是啊 我們不能忘帶這勾子
Ah, yes. We mustn't forget the grappling hook.

855
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,700
每個人都要嘲笑我這個勾子 你們會後悔的
Everybody's gotta make fun of the hook. You'll all be sorry.

856
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,700
我永遠也不會膩味這個
l will never get tired of that.

857
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,700
夥計們 你們看見了嗎?
Hey, guys. You seen this?

858
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,200
"公羊隊在最後時分擊敗黃蜂隊"

859
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,700
來幫幫我 兄弟們?
Can l get a little help, guys?

860
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,000
夥計們 幫個小忙?
Guys, a little help?

861
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,000
保加 失球了 輸了比賽
Beaugard loses the ball, fumbles the play.

862
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,700
哈密爾頓拿到球! 大黃蜂贏了!
Hamilton's got it! And the Hornets win.

863
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,891
因為你回來的時候
So because you took this tape with you

864
00:54:59,065 --> 00:55:00,299
帶上了這盒錄像
when you jumped back in time...

865
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,800
它依然存在
lt still exists.

866
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,500
很聰明 對吧?      太瘋狂了 夥計
Pretty clever, huh?         This is crazy, man.

867
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,000
你才是英雄!我要告訴其它人這件事
You're the man! l gotta tell the guys about this.

868
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,800
不行!      你不能那麼做!
No!          You can't do that!

869
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,000
沒必要! 這個是我們之間的秘密
This is too big. This has got to stay between us.

870
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,200
不用擔心 兄弟 我們得慶祝慶祝
Yeah, yeah, no worries, brother. But we gotta celebrate.

871
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,800
明天會在我家狂歡 你也來吧
Tomorrow we're partying at my house and you gotta be there.

872
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,000
我想去 但不行 我和查理有約
Oh, l want to. l, l can't, though. l'm hanging out with Charlie.

873
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,177
天氣網絡系統
The Weather Network is counting down

874
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:27,499
全天候倒計時十大冰雹
the top ten hailstorms of all time.

875
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,598
我說出來才發現
l didn't realize how lame an evening

876
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:42,099
這晚上過的也太無聊了
that was till l said it out loud.

877
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,300
謝謝
Oh! Thank you.

878
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,400
謝謝
Thanks.

879
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,000
開心嗎?
So, you having fun?

880
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,000
是啊 我從十歲以來再沒有參加過聚會
Oh, yeah. l haven't been to a party since l was ten.

881
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,500
記得一個扎馬尾辮的女孩吐了我一身
And l remember the pony threw up on me.

882
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,700
那是我的生日聚會
That was my birthday party.        Oh.

883
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,000
開玩笑
l'm kidding.

884
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,500
那就好
Oh, good.

885
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,100
星期六會去舞會吧?
So l guess you're going to the dance Saturday?

886
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,300
應該會吧
Yeah, l guess.

887
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,000
聽起來不太高興
You don't sound happy about it.

888
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,500
我也不知道 德裡克和我會參加每一個聚會
l don't know. Derek and l go to every party,

889
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,700
每一個社交場合
every social gathering.

890
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,200
想到都會噁心
lt's really a sickness when you think about it.

891
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,700
不知道
l don't know.

892
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,900
倍受歡迎看上去是一種很滿足的生活方式
Being popular seems like a very satisfying way of life.

893
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,700
我也不太清楚
l don't know about that.

894
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,400
有時候在想 有沒有選對路
Sometimes l wonder if l chose the right path.

895
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,000
看看你 看上去根本不在意...
l mean, look at you. You don't seem to mind that you're...

896
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,900
蠢豬的首領?
Captain of the dorks?

897
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,700
我沒想要這麼說
l wasn't going to say it like that.

898
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,197
老實說 你們看上去
But seriously, you guys look like

899
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,699
比其他人快樂
you're having so much more fun than everyone.

900
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,300
真的嗎? 我們看來
Really? 'Cause from our side,

901
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,100
你們總是很開心的
it looks like you are having all the fun.

902
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,700
是嗎?      當然
Really?         Yeah.

903
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,000
你好 維吉爾!      你好
Hey, Virg!         Hey.

904
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,900
真高興又跟你一起聚會
lt is so good partying with you again.

905
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,300
替我謝謝那些兄弟 那個壯實的大傢伙
Thank those other guys for me, the big, scary dude,

906
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,200
還有小笨蛋
and the little twerp.

907
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,600
噢 天 忘跟查理取消會面了
Oh! Dang it. l forgot to cancel with Charlie.

908
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,100
待會 我來跟他打個電話
Hold on, let me call him.

909
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,700
斯蒂芬妮過來看看      他應該都忘了
Stephanie, come see this.        He probably forgot all about it.

910
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,900
查理還要我道歉多少次?
Charlie, how many more times do l have to apologize?

911
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,200
還要212次
Two hundred and twelve times ought to do it.

912
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,200
查理聽著 我非常非常抱歉!
Charlie, listen, l'm really, really sorry!

913
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,900
好吧... 原諒你
Fine... l forgive you.

914
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,300
我真的很累
Look, I'm just really frazzled.

915
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,300
我很擔心時光機 還有骨牌效應
l'm worried about the time machine and possible ripple effects.

916
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,800
別掛 又來了個電話 我會打發掉的
Hang on, l've got another call. l'll get rid of them.

917
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,300
你好?
Hello?

918
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,800
維吉爾?
Hey, Virgil?

919
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,200
我不敢相信...      怎麼了?
l can't believe l just...         What's wrong?

920
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,600
他...
He, um...

921
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,700
他...      哪也別去 我這就來
He, um...        Don't go anywhere. l'll be there.

922
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,200
斯蒂芬 斯蒂芬
Steph. Steph.

923
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,900
斯蒂芬妮?
Stephanie?

924
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,700
8年級的時候我就沒再這樣了
l haven't done this since eighth grade.

925
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,977
之前這裡沒有這個
That, that wasn't there before.

926
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:38,199
你應該走前門的
You could have used the front door.

927
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,500
是啊 但那有什麼意思?
Yeah, but what fun would that be?

928
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,900
告訴我 發生什麼了?
So tell me, what happened?

929
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,400
德裡克很早就出去練習
So, Derek got out of practice early.

930
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,500
但我走出他家時 看見他在吻喬斯林·李
And when l went over to his house, l saw him kissing Jocelyn Lee.

931
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,400
斯蒂芬
Oh, Steph.

932
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,400
我早就知道
l knew it, too.

933
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,600
只是我不願意相信
l just didn't want to believe it.

934
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,400
真是太蠢了
l feel so stupid.

935
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,600
我知道你很喜歡吃開心果
l know how much you like pistachio nuts, but

936
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,474
跑來時
in the rush to get here

937
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:17,399
我順手買了一包
l accidentally grabbed a bag of pasta shells.

938
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,300
有意大利番茄醬嗎?
Do you have any marinara sauce?

939
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,800
沒有 我可以去買 如果...
No, l can go get some if you...

940
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,200
你在開玩笑
You're joking.

941
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,200
你能過來真的很好 維吉爾
lt was really nice of you to come over, Virg.

942
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,500
你真的是個很好的朋友
You're an amazing friend.

943
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,900
是啊...朋友
Yeah... friend.

944
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,000
喂?      寶貝兒 我們能把這事兒講清楚吧?
Hello?        Babe, can we talk this out?

945
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,700
是德裡克
lt's Derek.

946
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,300
聽著 我和他談談
Listen, l'm going to talk to him.

947
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,400
我要一次性跟他結束了
l have to end it once and for all.

948
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,200
祝你好運
Good luck.

949
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,500
我沒事兒!
l'm OK!

950
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,700
在初期發生後
These repeated irregularities are maintaining half-lives

951
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,600
這些不斷重複的不規則反應仍然是半衰期
after their primary incidence.

952
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,300
真的非常奇怪
lt's totally weirdsville.

953
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,700
這很嚴重 先生
l mean, it's serious, sir. Um...

954
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,126
這波動直接從
The fluctuations are emanating directly

955
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:35,599
薩莫頓高中放射出來
from Summerton High School.

956
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,900
我對此有個理論
l actually have a theory about that.

957
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,700
它是...
lt's, well...

958
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,400
部門有與FBl聯繫過嗎?
Does the department have any contacts at the FBl?

959
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,300
你有點可怕 有點不可接近
You know, you're kind of scary and unapproachable.

960
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,900
能和你坐一起嗎?
Can we sit with you?

961
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,500
你根本清楚我的狀況
You don't know what it's like to be me.

962
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,500
有名的運動員 非常受歡迎
Great athlete, hugely popular.

963
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,100
人們都希望我出現在賽場上
l mean, it's like people expect me to play the field.

964
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,000
還背叛了女朋友      你要說什麼?
Cheat almost.         What's your point?

965
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,800
但我沒有 喬斯林主動的
But l didn't cheat. Jocelyn made the first move.

966
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,800
她吻了我 但我沒有回吻她
She kissed me but l didn't kiss her back.

967
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,200
這不能算是背叛
That does not count as cheating.

968
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,000
這就是你要幫忙的
The thing is, and this is where you come in,

969
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,200
我希望你能及時的回到過去
l want you to go back in time

970
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,800
阻止斯蒂芬妮因為喬斯林跟我分手
and stop Stephanie from busting me with Jocelyn.

971
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,700
什麼?
What?

972
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,300
我為什麼要做?      因為我犯了大錯
Why should l?        Because l made a big mistake.

973
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,500
非常大的錯 我發誓再也不會發生了
A huge one. And it'll never happen again, l swear.

974
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,900
我不知道 你真的傷害了她
l don't know. l mean, you really hurt her.

975
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:40,000
我知道 我知道 我感覺很愧疚
l know. l know and l feel awful.

976
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,400
但是斯蒂芬和我已經在一起很長時間
But Steph and l have been going out a long time now.

977
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,100
每個男生都想得到她
She's everything a guy could ever want.

978
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,500
希望有天我們三個能再一起出去
l like that the three of us have been hanging out again.

979
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,600
像原來一樣 它還是會像以前
Like the old days, and it could still be like that, man.

980
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,700
拜託 夥計 你怎麼想?
Come on, buddy. What do you say?

981
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,300
我得考慮考慮      好的
l need to think about it.         Yeah.

982
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,300
當然
Yeah, sure.

983
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,200
怎麼了? 搶劫
Hey! What's going on? Hold up.

984
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,200
繫上安全帶
Put on your seat belt.

985
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,500
我告訴你們 你們抓錯人了
l'm tellin' you, you got the wrong guy.

986
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,500
但我可以告訴你們其他兩個人的名字...
But l can give you the names of the two...

987
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,100
我正要告訴他們假名字 我是不會出賣你們的
l was gonna give them fake names. l'd never rat you out.

988
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,700
是啊
Yeah, right.

989
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,436
讓我等一晚上電話的先生
Mr. ''Keep Me On Hold All Night.''

990
01:02:44,614 --> 01:02:46,799
下午好 先生們
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

991
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,098
我是美國聯邦調查局的
My name is Agent Rehnquist

992
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:50,599
瑞恩奎斯特特工
of the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

993
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,900
我要告訴你們一個秘密
And l'm going to let you boys in on a secret.

994
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,400
一個國家機密
A national secret.

995
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,200
1969年 在阿波羅號登月不久後
ln 1 969, shortly after the Apollo 1 1 moon landing,

996
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,700
美國政府開始建立
the United States government began funding

997
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,100
很多項科學計劃
a number of new scientific projects.

998
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,400
其中一項就是時光穿梭
One of these projects was time travel.

999
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,400
什麼?     時光穿梭?
What?         Time travel?

1000
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,500
那就另當別論了      太科幻了
That's something else.         So science fiction-y.

1001
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,100
拍好萊塢電影啊 這個...
Hollywood baloney. That's...

1002
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,700
這個計劃有了點結果
The project turned up little results

1003
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,200
但最終還是停止了
and was eventually shut down.

1004
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,100
文件再也沒有被碰過
The files never again touched.

1005
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,200
直到兩個月前
That is until two months ago

1006
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,600
一個費盡心機的人或群體
when an industrious individual, or individuals,

1007
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,300
闖入NASA主機
broke into the NASA mainframe,

1008
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,300
據我們追蹤 用的是薩莫頓高中的電腦
using a computer which we traced to Summerton High School.

1009
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,600
好吧! 我...
All right! l...

1010
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,200
我朋友想說
What my friend was about to say is that

1011
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,800
要是你不對我們進行任何控告
if you're not going to charge us with anything,

1012
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,100
不能把我們拘留在這裡 對吧 查查看
you can't keep us here. That's right, look it up.

1013
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,400
我學過一學期政府
l took a semester of Government.

1014
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,600
還得了個B-
Got a B minus.

1015
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,200
我不明白 長官 為什麼讓他們離開?
l don't understand, sir. You're just letting them go?

1016
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,100
監視能得到更多的信息
We can get more information by watching.

1017
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,200
是啊 但現在他們知道我們在監視
Yeah, but now they know we're watching them.

1018
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,200
是的 長官 真是絕妙的方案
Yes sir, excellent plan.

1019
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,100
糟糕 太糟糕了
This is bad. Real bad.

1020
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,800
是啊 恭喜啊 淘氣的納德
Yeah, way to go Naughty Ned.

1021
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,400
因為你才會有FBI跟在我們後面
Thanks to you we have the FBl on our backs.

1022
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,200
我?我幾個星期前就想停下來了
Me? l wanted to stop this whole thing weeks ago!

1023
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,900
但沒有 你用它來謀取私利
But no, you had to use it for your own personal gain.

1024
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,100
查理說的對 參加派對 與風雲人物聚會
Charlie's right. Going to parties, hanging with the populars.

1025
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,300
如果我沒記錯 你也得到不少好處
lf l remember correctly, you benefited too.

1026
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,300
怎麼了?      我們給了你生活
How so?        We gave you a life.

1027
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,400
之前 你是人人都怕的大塊頭
Before us, you were this big guy everyone was afraid of.

1028
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,200
你最好閉嘴 維吉爾      瞧
You better shut up, Virgil.        See.

1029
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,400
你變自私了 維吉爾
You're being mean.

1030
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,259
查理你怎麼不回家
Charlie, why don't you just go home

1031
01:04:41,413 --> 01:04:43,199
看著你的電腦和貓?
to your computer and your cat.

1032
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,300
我這就去
l will.

1033
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,800
祝你在風光的新生活中好運
Good luck on your new life as a popular person.

1034
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,302
我也走了
l'm outta here, too.

1035
01:04:51,931 --> 01:05:06,999
我過的很好 一直都很好
l'm better off on my own, l always have been.

1036
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,400
這是最後的數據
Well, that's the last of the data.

1037
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,600
很不幸 我們得到早上才會有答案
Unfortunately, we won't have an answer until morning.

1038
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,300
對不起 沒有一台超級電腦
Well, excuse me for not having a supercomputer.

1039
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,800
你好?
Hello?

1040
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000

Oh. Hey, Derek.

What do you say, Virg? Gonna help me out, buddy?

1042
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,400
當然...
Yeah, sure...

1043
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,600
...D石頭
...D-rock.

1044
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,600
早 喜鵲!
Ahh!         Good morning, Magpie!

1045
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,400
你媽媽讓我進來的 今天真是不錯的一天
Your mom let me in. lt is such a nice day l was thinking

1046
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,200
也許 可以出去走走 談談我們的未來
we could go on a walk and talk about our future.

1047
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,700
然後...
And then... oh!

1048
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,200
我想要個橙子屋      結果!
l'd like an orange house.         The results!

1049
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,400
你不需要地址 在信封上只用寫
You wouldn't need an address. On the envelope you just say

1050
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,700
"珍妮特·帕切拉斯科,橙子屋"
''Jeanette Pachelewski, orange house.''

1051
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,000
完成了!
lt's done!

1052
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,700
我不是個科學家
Oh, um, l'm no scientist,

1053
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,300
但看上去情況不太妙
but that doesn't look good.

1054
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,100
我們製造出了一個...一個...
We created a... a...

1055
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,800
一個...一個...快說呀 藍鳥
A... a... Spit it out, Bluebird.

1056
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,900
一個黑洞
A black hole.

1057
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:31,900
很糟糕 是不是?
That's bad, right?

1058
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,600
隨著時間的流失
As the timeline continues,

1059
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,300
我們可以看到
we see an increased number of occurrences

1060
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:39,299
在薩莫頓區域事件的擴大
here in the Summerton area.

1061
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,600
如果我們都翻到47頁 能看到加亮區...
lf we can all turn to page 47, we can see where l highlighted...

1062
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,800
我撒謊了...
Hey!        l lied!

1063
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,628
我偷了方程式
l stole the formula

1064
01:06:46,768 --> 01:06:48,299
我們進行了時間穿梭
we've been time-traveling all over the place.

1065
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,000
先你一步 向你介紹太平洋技術中心地震部
Way ahead of you. l'd like you to meet Doctors Connors

1066
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,300
康納斯博士和溫多普博士
and Winthorpe from the seismology department at Pacific Tech.

1067
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,300
博士 這是查理·塔特爾
Doctors, this is Charles Tuttle.

1068
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,500
你是誰? 9歲男孩      他14歲
What are you, nine years old?         He's fourteen.

1069
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,400
好些了 現在不覺得是個失敗者了
That's better. Now l don't feel like such a loser.

1070
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,800
那你們已經知道黑洞的事了?
So you already know about the black hole?

1071
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,800
什麼?      黑洞!
What?        The black hole!

1072
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,500
我知道你們資金不足 但別這樣
l knew you guys were underfunded, but come on.

1073
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,400
真可笑 我們想過各種最壞的結果
Preposterous. We ran the worst case scenario several times.

1074
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,500
從沒想到過黑洞
We never came up with a black hole.

1075
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,000
我發現有五六個小數沒有繼續
l see five, six decimals that weren't carried over.

1076
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,400
噢
Hmm.

1077
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,800
是啊 "噢"
Oops.        Yeah, oops.

1078
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,483
每次我們用那個機器
Each time we used the machine

1079
01:07:29,637 --> 01:07:31,499
空間時間連續性上的裂縫
the rift in the space-time continuum

1080
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,900
就沒有消失 現在這些波動合在了一起
did not disappear. lnstead the fluctuations blended together

1081
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,300
形成了一個巨大的黑洞
to create one giant black hole.

1082
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,778
黑洞最嚴重的地區會擴展開
The worst part is the black hole

1083
01:07:38,949 --> 01:07:41,599
直到吞掉"薩莫頓"
will spread until it swallows up Summerton.

1084
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,100
然後就是整個西北 接著是整個美國
Then the Northwest, then the entire United States.

1085
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,000
以此類推
And so on.

1086
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,607
還剩多久?
How much time till zero hour?

1087
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,859
據我估計...
According to my estimates we have...

1088
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,600
...離世界毀滅還剩不到4小時
...less than four hours till the end of the world.

1089
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,116
夥計們 我們要拉響紅色警報
OK, people, we are going to Code Red.

1090
01:07:57,274 --> 01:07:58,999
接通華盛頓 馬上
Get Washington on the phone, now!

1091
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,700
有一個方法可以扭轉局勢 不過是個遠射
There might be a way to reverse it, but it's a longshot.

1092
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,400
說來聽聽吧 長官
Well, let's hear it, sir.

1093
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,500
今晚的舞會讓我激動 維吉爾
l'm excited for the dance tonight.

1094
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,900
你知道嗎?
And you know what?

1095
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,800
我真高興你能跟我來
l'm really glad you're coming with me.

1096
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,700
要不朋友是幹什麼的?      少來
Hey, what are friends for?         Come on.

1097
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,700
一切就緒?      是的
Everything set?        Uh, yeah.

1098
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,012
衣服在棒球場
The suits are in the basement

1099
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:09,099
我們穿過咖啡廳下的隧道過去
we'll go through the tunnels under the cafeteria.

1100
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,400
挺好 他們一宣佈贏家我們就走
Sweet. We'll go as soon as they announce the winners.

1101
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,700
好啊 維吉爾
Hey, Virgil.

1102
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,800
斯蒂芬...
Steph...

1103
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,147
你相信人的一生
Do you believe that a person's life

1104
01:09:28,306 --> 01:09:30,999
在一瞬間就能改變嗎?
can change in a single moment?

1105
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,600
有時是變好 有時只會更爛?
Sometimes for the better, other times for the worse?

1106
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,700
我想是的
Yeah, l guess.

1107
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,300
我們生命中的一刻即將被改寫
There's a moment in one of our lives that's about to change.

1108
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,600
不知道是會變好還是變壞
And l don't know if it's for the better or for the worse.

1109
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,100
維吉爾 我不大明白
Virgil, um, l'm not following.

1110
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,700
注意...
Uh, attention...

1111
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,600
大家都注意了
Um, attention everyone.

1112
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,600
該是宣佈舞會國王和王后的時候了
lt's time to announce this year's king and queen of the dance.

1113
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,200
但先來段...
But first...

1114
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,900
寶貝 雷德 我想熱一點
Sonny, Red, and l wanna fry up some

1115
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,518
花生黃油和香蕉三明治
peanut butter and banana sandwiches.

1116
01:10:15,686 --> 01:10:23,799
謝謝 非常感謝
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1117
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,000
這是貓王艾維斯·普裡斯萊 有人知道嗎?
lt's Elvis Presley. Anyone?

1118
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,900
不會吧 是個很有天賦的...隨便吧
Come on, that was a brilliant... Whatever.

1119
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,100
斯蒂芬妮·詹姆森還有維吉爾·福克斯
Stephanie Jameson and Virgil Fox

1120
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,000
上來吧 你們贏了
get up here. You won.

1121
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,300
真讓人吃驚      哪有
This is such a surprise.          Not really.

1122
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,432
為了保證我們能贏
To guarantee we'd win

1123
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:42,399
我準時趕回來 塞滿了投票箱
l went back in time and stuffed the ballot box.

1124
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,400
什麼?
What?

1125
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,400
詹姆森小姐和福克斯先生
Miss Jameson and Mr. Fox.

1126
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,600
別讓它離開你腦袋 還有時間查票
Don't let it go to your head. There's still time for a recount.

1127
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,400
你真的塞滿了那個盒子?
So, um, did you really stuff the box?

1128
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,300
是的
Yeah.

1129
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,200
你 當然 不然誰會投我票?
l mean, you, sure, but who would vote for me?

1130
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,300
我會
l would.

1131
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,400
這太奇怪了      是啊
This is weird.         Yeah.

1132
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,000
為什麼?      一個不錯的奇怪
Why?        A good weird.

1133
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,800
確實      你怎麼能跟某人做這麼長
Right.         How you can be friends with someone

1134
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,700
時間的朋友...
for so long, then...

1135
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,600
這不一樣      一個不錯的不一樣
lt's different..          A good different.

1136
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,400
來吧 兄弟 該走了      噢 關於那個
Come on, brother, it's time to go.           Oh, about that.

1137
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,800
我想 我反悔了      你答應過的
l think l changed my mind.         You promised.

1138
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,700
維吉爾?      哪也別去 我待會就回來
Virgil?        Don't go anywhere. l'll be right back.

1139
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,800
我知道維吉爾搶走斯蒂芬妮會讓德雷克抓狂
l knew Derek would be hacked about Virgil bringing Stephanie.

1140
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,200
打!
Fight!

1141
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,700
不      打 打
Oh, no.         Fight, fight.

1142
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,400
德裡克 等等 我們能談談嗎?
Derek, wait up. Can we talk about this?

1143
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,800
哦 天哪
Oh, man.

1144
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,700
斯蒂芬妮 維吉爾去哪兒了?
Stephanie, where's Virgil?

1145
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,600
他和德裡克出去了      為什麼?
He left with Derek.         Why?

1146
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,100
別告訴我他又要跳回到過去?
Don't tell me he's going to jump back in time?

1147
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,600
上帝 他就是要這麼做!
Oh my gosh, that's what he's doing!

1148
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,400
他會把事情搞的一團糟的!
He might make things worse!

1149
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,900
借過! 對不起!      比世界末日還要糟糕?
Excuse me! Sorry!         Worse than the end of the world?

1150
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,000
德裡克 我不能這麼做
Derek, l don't think l can do this.

1151
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,700
什麼? 為什麼?
What, why?

1152
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,400
斯蒂芬妮 我只是...只是覺得...
Stephanie. l just... l just think...

1153
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,600
夥計 別告訴我 你想要搶我的女人
Dude, don't tell me you're going to try to steal my girl.

1154
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
你是我的朋友 朋友之間不能那麼做
We're friends. l mean, buddies don't do that to each other.

1155
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,800
維吉爾! 維吉爾·福克斯!
Virgil! Virgil Fox!

1156
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,300
維吉爾 我們有點小麻煩
Virgil, we have a small problem.

1157
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,600
只剩不到一個小時來拯救整個星球!
We have less than an hour to save the planet!

1158
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,518
你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

1159
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:19,399
好吧 好吧 這裡怎麼了?
Well, well. What do we have here, hmm?

1160
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,400
看來要開始一場騷亂
Looks like the beginnings of a fracas.

1161
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,300
一場什麼?      一場騷亂!
A what?        A fracas!

1162
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,100
戰爭      晚上留校
lt's a fight.         We'll sort out the detentions later.

1163
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,300
現在 大家都回到體育館
Right now, all of you get back to the gym.

1164
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,200
都動起來!
Everyone move!

1165
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,700
都不許動! FBl!
Everyone freeze! FBl!

1166
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,800
不許動! ClA!
Stop! ClA!

1167
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,700
計量局!
Bureau of Weights and Measures!

1168
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,500
以後 你得先出來
ln the future, you should probably go first.

1169
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,300
維吉爾 這正是我要說的 來吧
Virgil, that's what l was talking about. Come on.

1170
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,800
我們得趕快把所有人撤離!
We need to get these people out of here now!

1171
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,800
那我們得進黑洞 關閉它?
So, we're supposed to go inside the black hole and close it?

1172
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,800
據我所知 這是唯一的出路
As far as l can figure, it's the only way.

1173
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,530
我們要帶著這個控制器
We'll take the remote pack with us

1174
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:35,399
改變我們著陸的極性
and reverse the polarity once we land.

1175
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,300
什麼東西?      我一直在研究
What pack?         l've been working on

1176
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,800
一種控制我們從另一邊跳出的新方法
a new way to control our jumps from the other side.

1177
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,000
好吧 帶上電話
OK, hold the phone.

1178
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,600
我們不能讓學生進去 他們會死的
We can't let these students go in that, they could die!

1179
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,826
別無選擇
We have no choice.

1180
01:14:45,994 --> 01:14:48,299
他們是唯一熟悉使用這個儀器的人
They're the only ones familiar with the equipment.

1181
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,500
要是他們不去 我們就得死
lf they don't go then we could all die.

1182
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,500
快點
God speed.

1183
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,000
是我把一切弄的一團糟
l'm the one who messed everything up.

1184
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,400
我進去 查理和齊克跟這個沒關係
l'll go. Charlie and Zeke had nothing to do with it.

1185
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,300
什麼叫沒關係? 是我發明的
What do you mean, nothing to do with it? l invented it.

1186
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,800
我是幫兇      不 你沒有
l helped.          No, you didn't.

1187
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,100
我有過      你刷的油漆!
Yeah, l did.         You painted it!

1188
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,300
打擾一下
Excuse me.

1189
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,300
好吧 夠了 夠了
OK. Enough! Enough!

1190
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,300
你們都去
You'll both go.

1191
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,100
你們也需要我 長官 還有我的鉤子
You'll be needing me too, sir, and my hook.

1192
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,900
聽著 我們一旦轉換了黑洞的極性
Listen, guys, once we've reversed the wormhole's polarity,

1193
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,100
無法計算 多長時間後會關閉
there's no measuring how quickly it will close.

1194
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,774
它可能會開幾分鐘
lt could stay open for several more minutes

1195
01:16:09,904 --> 01:16:12,199
也有可能會瞬間消失
or vanish instantaneously.

1196
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,800
要是我們活著完成任務
And even if we do make it back alive,

1197
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:14,923
不能保證
there's no guarantee

1198
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:18,399
我們能回到此刻
we'll return exactly to the point we exited from.

1199
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,300
好的 好的      好運 齊克!
Aye aye, Ser Positive.         Good luck, Zeke!

1200
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,400
維吉爾 聽說你要去拯救世界
Virgil, l hear you're trying to save the world.

1201
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,500
對啊 你哥哥很酷吧?
That's right. Your big brother's pretty cool, huh?

1202
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,700
要是你死了 我可以用你的房間嗎? 我的太小了...
When you die can l have your room? Mine is way too small and...

1203
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,500
拜 艾米      查理
Bye, Amy.         Charlie, um...

1204
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,200
安全回來 好嗎?
Come back in one piece, OK?

1205
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,800
快點 查理 我們要走了 查理
Come on, Charlie, we gotta go. Charlie?

1206
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,800
查理?
Charlie?

1207
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,300
醒醒      沒事兒 齊克
Here.         All right, Zeke.

1208
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:03,900
維吉爾
Virgil.

1209
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,600
你可以的
You can do it!

1210
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:14,200
聽著 我...不管發生什麼 我只想讓你知道...
Listen, l just... whatever happens, l just want you to know...

1211
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,300
夥計 好運 一切順利
Hey man, good luck. With everything.

1212
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,700
是啊 太好了
Yeah, great.

1213
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,400
要...
Just, um...

1214
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,200
萬事小心
Just be careful.

1215
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,700
行嗎?      好的
OK?          OK.

1216
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,500
一分鐘人 一分鐘人 一分鐘人
Minutemen! Minutemen! Minutemen!

1217
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,300
至少最後他們正了名
At least they finally got the name right.

1218
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,100
一起吧 夥伴們!
Let's do this, fellas!

1219
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,300
太酷了
Whoa. Cool.

1220
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,600
太空人
Wow! Space men!

1221
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,356
我們到綠野僊蹤了
l think we landed in Munchkinland.

1222
01:18:57,554 --> 01:18:59,999
酷斃了 怎麼了 小鬼?
Cool. What up, Munchkins?

1223
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
我們穿過了小鎮 來到公園了
Actually, we're across town at the park.

1224
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,700
你們來自那個星球? 海王星?
What planet did you come from? From Neptune?

1225
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:07,900
海王星上的人吃通心粉嗎? 我喜歡通心粉
Do people on Neptune eat macaroni? l love macaroni.

1226
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,100
通心粉是蔬菜嗎?
ls macaroni a vegetable?

1227
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,900
打住 小鬼 我們要在這兒工作
Beat it, kid. We're workin' here.

1228
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,000
架好天線
OK, set up the antenna.

1229
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,500
開始轉換序列
Beginning reversal sequence.

1230
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,200
來吧
Come on.

1231
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,400
太帥了
Wow! Sweet!

1232
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:24,900
看上去不錯
This looks good!

1233
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,800
擴張速度放慢了!
Rate of increase is slowing!

1234
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,000
漩渦的極性在減弱
The vortex's polarity is decreasing.

1235
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,400
平穩了!
Stabilization achieved!

1236
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,100
成功了!      哈!
l think we did it!         Ha!

1237
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,300
漩渦接觸到地面還有20分鐘
We have 20 minutes till the vortex touches the ground.

1238
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,700
然後我們就能回去了
Then we can jump back.

1239
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,100
嘿 夥計們
Hey, guys.

1240
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,512
今天是2005年9月3號
Today is September 3rd, 2005.

1241
01:19:59,689 --> 01:20:00,999
高中第一天
First day of school freshman year.

1242
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,200
就是這天...      "那個事件"
Oh, that's the day...         ''The lncident.''

1243
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,600
"那個事件"      是啊
''The lncident.''         Of course!

1244
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
量子加速器模塊
The day a module of quantum acceleration

1245
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,400
第一次涉及空間時間連續性!火箭車
first interacted with the space-time continuum! The rocket cart.

1246
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,308
它聯繫著我們
lt's linked the wormhole from

1247
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:15,999
現在到過去的這個時候
our present to this moment in the past.

1248
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,400
不久後 我們...      兄弟
ln a few moments our...        Dude.

1249
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,300
不要這樣 維吉爾
Don't do it, Virgil.

1250
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,300
維吉爾 不要!
Virg, no!

1251
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
維吉爾 慢點!
Virg, come on!

1252
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,500
你想阻止即將發生的一切?
You're thinking of stopping what's going on there?

1253
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,800
為什麼不? 這不正是一分鐘人要做的嗎?
Why not? lsn't that what the Minutemen do?

1254
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,000
要阻止的錯誤嗎
Un-do mistakes?

1255
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,700
我在那兒做錯了一件事
Well, l made a mistake down there.

1256
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,200
我有機會成為大人物
l have a chance to be somebody.

1257
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,600
好吧 但你得知道
OK, but know this.

1258
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,800
下面所發生的 是我們成了好朋友
What happened down there is we became friends.

1259
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,300
那天我們一起綁在蠢公羊雕像上
That day that we were tied up together on that stupid Ram statue.

1260
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,200
這天
This day.

1261
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:09,100
你恨的這天 只是因為讓你有點尷尬
This day you hate so much because you got a little embarrassed?

1262
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,500
但是我最愛的一天
This is my favorite day.

1263
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:17,300
雖然我還是個討厭鬼 但這又有什麼
Even though l'd still be a nerd, it didn't really matter anymore,

1264
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
因為我有了真正的朋友
because now l had a real friend.

1265
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,300
這會讓一切都好起來
And that would always make everything OK.

1266
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,200
這就夠了
So much for always, l guess.

1267
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,800
聽著 聽著 維吉爾
Listen... listen, Virg,

1268
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,100
你想做什麼就做什麼
you do what you gotta do here.

1269
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,200
要是事物的另一面不一樣
And if things aren't the same on the other side...

1270
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,200
也是種不錯的選擇
...it's been a good ride.

1271
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,900
夥計們 等等 你們不應該這麼做
Hey guys, wait! You shouldn't do that.

1272
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,400
因為我有個更好的主意
'Cause l've got a much better idea.

1273
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,400
為什麼不把這個塗他們身上?
l mean, why don't we smear this all over them?

1274
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,600
失敗者
Losers.

1275
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,700
不 不 漩渦關閉時間快耗盡!
No! No! The closure rate of the vortex went into overdrive!

1276
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,600
你是說...      漩渦馬上就要碰到地面了
You're telling me...         lf that touches the ground,

1277
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,800
我們會永遠被困在這裡的
we'll be trapped here for good.

1278
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,500
那維吉爾怎麼辦?      我們不可能去找他
What about Virgil?         There's no way we'll make it to him

1279
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,500
並且準時到達漩渦!
and back to the vortex in time!

1280
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,400
查理! 查理 起來!
Charlie! Charlie, get up!

1281
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,500
起來 查理! 我們得快跑
Get up, Charlie! We gotta keep moving!

1282
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,900
走吧!
Let's go!

1283
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,000
趕不上了
We're never going to make it.

1284
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,300
還有1英里遠 我們永遠被困在過去了
We're a mile away. We're stuck in the past forever.

1285
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,300
兄弟們 你們不想回去了
Man, you do not want to go back there.

1286
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,600
橄欖球員把學生粗魯的掛起來 這是太齷齪了
Kids getting roughed up by football players. lt's real ugly.

1287
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,800
你說什麼?
You don't say?

1288
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,300
開始 是有點為小破孩感到抱歉 但
At first, l felt kinda sorry for the dorky kid, but...

1289
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,000
我意識到 他還為我做什麼?
...then l realized, what does he need me for?

1290
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,200
他有一個好朋友在那裡
He's got himself a great friend down there.

1291
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,800
總有一天 他還會有其他的好朋友
And someday he'll have other great friends, too.

1292
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,300
帥呆了!
Scorch!

1293
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,400
我們握手言和吧
You know, let's come up with our own handshake.

1294
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,250
我們可以走了嗎?
Can we go?

1295
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:36,899
我不想再重複三年高中
l don't feel like repeating three years of high school.

1296
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,800
對啊 抱歉      好主意 沖 衝啊
Right. Sorry.         Good idea! Go, go!

1297
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,600
繫上安全帶!
Seatbelts!

1298
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,900
小心!
Look out!

1299
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,200
車!
Car!         Ahh!

1300
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:20,300
天哪!
Oh my God!         Whoa, whoa!

1301
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,900
幹什麼啊?!      什麼意思啊?
What are you doing?!         What do you mean?

1302
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,600
那是第十四大街 漩渦在後面
That was 1 4th Street! The vortex is back that way.

1303
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,300
我的錯
Oh, my bad.

1304
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,700
我們趕不上了!      沒問題
We're never gonna make it!         No problem.

1305
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,700
鐵鉤!
Whoa!         Yeah, grappling hook!

1306
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:50,900
擊個掌!
Oh my God!          Yeah!

1307
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,400
手抓住輪子!
Now keep your hand on the wheel!

1308
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,700
衝啊 維吉爾!      快衝啊 不然趕不上了!
Go, Virgil!        Go or we're not gonna make it!

1309
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,600
我們快趕不上了!
We're not gonna make it!

1310
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,700
我們快趕不上了!
We're not gonna make it!

1311
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,300
一分鐘人準則!
Minutemen rule!

1312
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,500
我的火箭車呢?
Where's my rocket cart?

1313
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,500
這是哪天?
What day is it?

1314
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,000
夠了 不要再時間穿梭了!
That is it. No more time travel!

1315
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:57,900
聽著 你們應該在慢跑
OK, up. You're supposed to be jogging.

1316
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,300
我的體育課不准任何人偷懶
Now, nobody loafs in my gym class.

1317
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,500
你不瞭解!      我瞭解的夠多了!
You don't understand!         l understand plenty!

1318
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,900
我知道你沒有慢跑 動起來 走吧
l understand you're not jogging. So let's move it! Let's go!

1319
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
走 走 走
Go! Go! Go!

1320
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,700
開始慢跑 快動 快動 快動
Start jogging! Move it, move it, move it!

1321
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:17,100
我也要一件那麼帥的慢跑服
l got to get one of those cool jogging suits.

1322
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,000
冒煙的輪胎?
A smoking tire?

1323
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:29,737
行了 同學們
All right, people

1324
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:32,399
不准在走廊閒逛 走開
no loitering in the hallways. Let's move it along.

1325
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,400
走開 快 快
Go!

1326
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:45,400
我一定要給學校立定一個穿著制度
l'm definitely gonna institute a dress code in this place!

1327
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,700
瞧 斯蒂芬 我需要她的幫助
See, Steph, l need her help.

1328
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,700
我根本聽不懂你在講什麼
l have no idea what you just said.

1329
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,300
我說"我的男朋友是一個說謊的弱智"
l said, ''My boyfriend is a lying cheesebrain.''

1330
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,500
別這樣 斯蒂芬      德裡克我要學習
Come on, Steph.         Derek, l'm trying to study.

1331
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,300
你們知道嗎?這天我們第一次時光穿梭
You know what? This is the first day we time traveled.

1332
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,300
這一天我們想中彩票
The day we tried to win the lottery.

1333
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,400
衣服真不賴 大塊頭
Wow, nice outfits, bozos.

1334
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:06,700
好啊 德裡克
Hey, Derek.

1335
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,400
與喬斯林過的開心
Have fun with Jocelyn.

1336
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,300
什麼意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

1337
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,700
我不知道 你們倆嘴上功夫真不賴
Oh, l don't know. l figured you're both so good with lipstick,

1338
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,200
你們真是天造地設的一對
you'd make a perfect match.

1339
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,500
你總是像一頭蠢豬一樣 維吉爾
You were always gonna be a dork anyway, Virgil.

1340
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,100
你一直就是笨蛋 德裡克
And you were always gonna be a jerk, Derek.

1341
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:29,900
祝你生活愉快
Have a nice life.

1342
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,800
女士們      噢 新衣服呀 美冠鸚鵡?
Ladies.        Oh, what's new, Cockatoo?

1343
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,500
你看上去像個超級英雄      謝謝 小南瓜
Wow, you look like a superhero.         Thanks, pumpkin.

1344
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,096
你還沒有吻過她
You've never kissed her.

1345
01:27:56,275 --> 01:27:58,599
那個在走廊上的事兒還沒發生呢
The scene in the hallway hasn't happened yet.

1346
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:02,900
噢 是啊 珍妮特不好意思
Oh, right. Jeanette, l'm sorry!

1347
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,700
剛才只是... 我有原因的
l was just... l can explain.

1348
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,100
嘿 沒事兒
Hey, it's OK.

1349
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:12,700
好 斯蒂芬      噢 好
Uh, Steph.         Oh, hey.

1350
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,800
你剛才沒在這兒看見我 是吧?
You didn't see me in here before, did you?

1351
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,000
沒有 怎麼穿這麼奇怪的外套?
No, and um... what's with the weird suit?

1352
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,700
剛才我綵排了學校一個
Oh, l was just rehearsing a little school play

1353
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,200
關於時光穿梭的劇 讓我想了很多
about time travel and, uh, it kinda got me thinking.

1354
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,500
要是真能回到過去 我會改變什麼
lf l really could go back in time, what would l change?

1355
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:30,800
這件雪衣?
That snowsuit?

1356
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,700
我會告訴斯蒂芬妮對她的感覺
l would tell Stephanie how l really feel about her.

1357
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,400
我覺得她很棒
That l think she's great.

1358
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,900
真的?      是的
Really?        Yeah.

1359
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,400
要是我能回到過去
And if l could go back in time...

1360
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,100
我也會告訴維吉爾同樣的話
...l think l'd tell Virgil the same thing.

1361
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,700
維吉爾!      什麼?
Virgil!         What?

1362
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:55,700
查理!
Charlie!

1363
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,300
"遠距傳物"對你來說有什麼意義嗎?
What does the word ''teleportation'' mean to you?

1364
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,120
比時光穿梭還要強
lt's bigger than time travel

1365
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:01,899
一種新的運輸典範
a whole new transportation paradigm.

1366
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,000
我們依然需要幻燈機...
We still have the slide projector...

1367
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:05,700
我會打電話給你的
l'll call you.

1368
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,500
聽上去想時間穿梭      不要 查理
lt's like time travel.        No, Charlie.

1369
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,400
黑洞!      跟著我
Black hole!          Follow me.

1370
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,428
斯蒂芬妮 聽我說!
Stephanie, listen to me!

1371
01:29:11,574 --> 01:29:15,499
告訴他 他喜歡你 你會喜歡他的
Talk to him, he likes you! You'll like him!

1372
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,700
想想油價 想想全球變暖
Think about gas prices. Think about global warming.

1373
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,400
我會讓珍妮特回來的!
l could get Jeanette back!

1374
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,100
"兩周後"

1375
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,700
好 我們來了 什麼急事?
OK, we're here. Where's the fire?

1376
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,500
先生們 做好心理準備
Ah, gentlemen, brace yourselves,

1377
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
這在整個人類歷史
for this is going to be the greatest invention...

1378
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,200
將會是一項偉大的發明
ln the history of all mankind.

1379
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,800
蝦仁餡餅不是個好主意
Whoa. l knew the shrimp tacos were a bad idea.

1380
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,500
你又做一個...他又做了一個查理
You made another... He made another Charlie.

1381
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,400
是的 我發現了
Yeah. l got that.

1382
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,800
多偉大啊?
How great is this?

1383
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,600
我不覺得"偉大"是個合適的詞      "恐怖"怎麼樣?
l'm not sure ''great'' is the word.         ''Terrible''?

1384
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,000
就是這個      想想可能性
Yeah. That's it.         Think of the possibilities.

1385
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,500
現實實用性? 你有小提琴課
The practical applications? You have a violin lesson,

1386
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,200
但你還想看企業聯合組織審判節目
but you also want to catch Judge Judy.

1387
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,900
沒問題 這就解決方法
No problemo. Here's the solution.

1388
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
或者你可以錄下來
Or you could just record it.        Mmm.

1389
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:11,931
這例子不好
Bad example.

1390
01:30:12,052 --> 01:30:16,299
我要同一學期上AP歷史和AP物理
l'm taking AP history and AP physics the same semester,

1391
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,600
但我的課又超量了
but for some reason l'm on academic overload,

1392
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:20,700
最後沒有時間複習考試...
and don't have time to study for both finals...

1393
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,400
夥計們      你們要幹什麼?
Guys.         What are you doing?

1394
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,200
齊克 維吉爾      這是我的胳膊
Zeke, Virgil.          That's my arm.

1395
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,100
你們要去哪兒? 你們不能把我們留在裡面
Where are you going? You can't leave us in here.

1396
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,400
至少你有個伴
At least you'll have company.

1397
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:34,000
咱們團隊怎麼樣?一分鐘人又開始了!
What about the team? Minutemen ride again!

1398
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:36,200
我喜歡這個想法 來個團隊怎樣?
l like that. What about the team?

1399
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,700
這孩子真的很愛科學
That kid really loves science.

1400
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,600
是啊
Yeah.

1401
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,400
挖苦結束 來個小脆餅吧
Hey, scooch over. l'm going for the pretzel nubs.

1402
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:04,900
那我們就是要進黑洞 把它關起來?
So, we're supposed to go inside the black hole and close it?

1403
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,100
據我所知 這是唯一的方法
As far as l can figure, it's the only way.

1404
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:16,800
