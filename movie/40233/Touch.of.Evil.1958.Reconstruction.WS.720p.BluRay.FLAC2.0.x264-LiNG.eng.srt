[Chuckles]

148
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:05,320
Just a little while ago,
this was a quiet, peaceful town here,

149
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,121
- And now this Vargas comes along and...
- Mr. Grandi!

150
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,755
<i>Mr. Grandi, you said you had</i>
<i>something for my husband. </i>

151
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,493
- Don't you think
it's time you gave it to me.
- I think it's time for him...

152
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,967
to lay off my brother
in Mexico City!

153
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,970
That's advice.

154
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,667
That's what I got for him.

155
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,382
Then the conference is over?

156
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,383
I'm free to leave?

157
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:38,083
Free? Nobody was holding you
or keeping you, Mrs. Vargas.

158
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,786
Nobody laid a hand on you.

159
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,490
<i>You were just paying us</i>
<i>a little visit. </i>

160
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,498
Well,

161
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,538
good-bye, all.

162
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,111
Quinlan, we just can't
cross over into Mexico like this.

163
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,453
- Thousands do every day.
- Tourists, but...

164
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,755
So, we're tourists.

165
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,988
Captain Quinlan wants
to check on the girl...

166
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,030
that was with Linnekar
in the death car.

167
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,067
I know. She was one of the stripteasers.
I think I told you.

168
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,865
- Yeah, Pete told me
before I left the ranch.
- That's right.

169
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,931
And I told him that I wanted to see
all the stripteasers in the joint.

170
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,773
This is Mexican territory.
What can we do?

171
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,941
There's no law against visitors
asking questions, is there, Mr. Vargas?

172
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,382
Hey, where'd he go?

173
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,451
Susie, where
in the world were you?

174
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,514
- Oh, Mike, darling.
Just wait till I tell you.
- What happened?

175
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,958
The craziest thing...

176
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,462
- Who's theJane?
- His wife.

177
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,967
Well, what do you know?
She don't look Mexican either.

178
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,755
[Quinlan] The key
to this whole thing's the dynamite.

179
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,765
The killer didn't just
want Linnekar dead.

180
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,597
<i>He wanted him destroyed, </i>
<i>annihilated. </i>

181

Anything wrong, Vargas?

[Chuckles]
No, I just couldn't catch him.

187
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,881

- [Grunting]

- Yes, yes, and I'm not
finished with you yet.

189
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,822
- The show's over. I'm going home.
- Oh. Oh, no. No, ma'am.

190
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:31,022
<i>Mr. Adair, as far as I could</i>
<i>fiind out, none of these people</i>
<i>even knew the murdered girl. </i>

191
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,862
- Let's talk to this young lady.
- Zita? I didn't know her.

192
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,425
She only joined the show
a few days ago.

193
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,097
[Grunting]
We're wasting our time around here.

194

Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Well, good night, my dear.

195
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,579
- [Schwartz] What happened
to Menzies and Vargas?
- I don't know.

196
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,377
- [Adair] I'll give you a call.
There may be more questions.
- They'll show up.

197
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,886

open for business?

200

Tana? Oh, maybe
she'll cook chili for him...

202
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,237

It's either the candy

Certainly nothing to do
with this bombing up there.

- Somebody threw acid at Vargas.
- It doesn't matter. He missed me.

00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,915
- Oh, the first one?
- To have been young, good-looking...

248
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,682
- Were there two men?
- Not exactly.

249
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,157
Not exactly. You're saying
she was taken to this dive by force?

Not by force. No.

I haven't run into him.
What?

Aren't you going to do something?

- Make it a charge.
Isn't that police procedure in Mexico?
- Procedure?

258
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,781
- You say your wife was attacked.
- I did not say she was attacked.

- Did she say she was molested?
- <i>Not physically. No. </i>

- Was obscene language used?
- I don't think so.

261
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,188
Then how do you explain the fact
that your wife allowed herself
to be picked up?

262
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,892
- She was not picked up!
- Now, Hank, I think we're getting off
on the wrong tack here.

263

young man was a friend of hers?
- Obviously not.

picked up on the streets?

You don't seem very fond of the job.

There are plenty of soldiers

No, he didn't.
As a matter of fact, he's under arrest.

about some stolen dynamite out here.

- Fired anybody lately?
- I figured you'd be asking about that.

Yeah? A boy named Sanchez?

Sure. He's been playin' around
with the boss's daughter.

00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,926
- Oh, with the big ears?
- Our office prosecuted that guy
for voluntary manslaughter.

449
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,935
Get him over here.
That's Eddie Farnum.

- Got five to ten.

- Three months.
- Quick parole.

Not yet. I'm just goin'

- Yeah?

You remember him? He was that slick

- Quinlan!

Well, it figured we'd have Hank Quinlan
to deal with. You finished packing?

Do we play around first
with a few nasty questions,

00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,744
or does he get out
the rubber hose right away?

That's what I told Sanchez.

You weren't workin' as a shoe clerk

I don't like to repeat myself.

That's all he said.

523

Also, he told me he thinks
he's in for some sort of third degree.

524

I assured him he had
nothing to worry about.

525
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:34,070
Casey, go in with Vargas. Maybe he don't
know how to use an American telephone.

526
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,005
I think I ran into something here,

- Where's Captain Quinlan?
- He's in there makin' a search.

575
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,112
- What am I doing in here?
- Oh, Hank!

576
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,705
- What's the idea,
barging in on me like this?
- Sorry, Hank.

577
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,774
- What you got in here?
- I forgot to give you your cane.

578
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,446
- All right, sit down.
- Queer thing, Hank.

579
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:41,685
- I know him.
- When I was taking Mrs. Vargas,
I picked this guy on the way.

580
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:45,195
It's UncleJoe Grandi.
Why'd you bring him in here?

581
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:48,993
For some crazy reason,
he was following me in his car.

582
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,000
- He was tailin' you?
- Yeah.

Why would I be following a cop?
He's an idiot.

585
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,374
Maybe because you thought
he was a Mexican cop.

586
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,902
Because you thought he was Vargas.
He was drivin' Vargas' car.

587
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,915
- Oh.
- Right?

588
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,918
You're right. So I thought
I was following Vargas. So what?

589
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,955
- Sit down.
- It's a free country.

Yes, it's the Mirador Motel,

Oh, darling,
the news is bad.

597
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,103
Quinlan is about to arrest
that boy Sanchez and...

598
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:39,548
Mike, is that why you called?
To tell me somebody's been arrested?

599
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:44,577
No, that's not really
why I called. It...

600
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:49,183
It's to tell you
how sorry I am about all this...

601
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,355
and how very, very much
I love you.

I was just listening to you breathe.

Oh.

00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,013
Of course you are.

Oh, I just wanted to tell you
I'm awfully tired.

612
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:35,197
[Sighs] Excuse me,
this is Mrs. Vargas talking.

- I know. It couldn't be anybody else.
- Oh?

You're the only guest we got here
just now... in the whole place.

Oh, well,

00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,479
there's no sign
to put up outside the door,

I wouldn't be disturbed.

Oh, that is, if you're
the one who's in charge.

Don't you worry, Mrs. Vargas.
I am the one who's in charge.

620
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:02,663
Nobody's going to get through
to you... unless I say so.

621
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:06,965
Vargas! Sergeant Menzies wanted me
to give you this. Your car key.

00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,403
Thanks.

623
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:18,044
- Well, I was beginning to think
we'd lost you for good, amigo.
- I had a phone call to make.

624
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,846
- [Speaking Spanish]
- English. English.

625

- They've got me measured
for the fall guy.
- Now, just a minute.

626
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,890
Sure, I'm the fortune hunter
who hypnotized Marcia...

627
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,983
who made her kill her father
for his money.

628
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,326
If I had that kind of power, I wouldn't
be where I am today, believe me.

629
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,959
- You mean you don't
care about the money?
- Why should I lie?

630
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,469
If it hadn't been for the money,
I wouldn't have given her a tumble.

631
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:43,665
But I told her that right
at the beginning, but still she wanted...

632
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,675
Why bother?
You wouldn't believe it.

633
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,110
Try me.
I'm a good listener.

634
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:54,242
Well, instead of the man chasing
the girl, suppose she was the one.

635
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,151
Suppose she asked him to marry her.
What should he do?

Draw himself up and say,
" No, my dear, you and I...

00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,350
could never be happy together
because of your money."

00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,258
- What would you do, Vargas?
- The question is: What did you do?

650
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,688
- I haven't been very thorough.
- Now listen,

00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,698
how long do I have to sit here?

652
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:47,533
I wasn't breaking no laws. I was just...
I don't even know these people.

- Who's this?

- UncleJoe Grandi. Another Grandi.
- UncleJoe?

655

- I don't know this Grandi.

656
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,740
- Yeah? I got nothing
to do with you, Vargas.
- Shut up.

00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,944
I'm an American citizen.

658
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:05,113
- Listen. Vic was arrested
in Mexico City, Captain.
- Shut up.

659
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,749
Vargas is gonna testify
at his trial Thursday.

660
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,986
It's got absolutely nothing
to do with...

661

You just try any rough stuff,
UncleJoe, and you'll find out.

662
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:16,332
He's a big shot in
the Mexican government. Listen.

663
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,665

<i>how much dynamite was it you stole? </i>

670
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,349
<i>[Sanchez] What good</i>
<i>would it be to tell you that</i>
<i>I've never seen any dynamite? </i>

671
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,360
<i>[Quinlan]</i>

<i>a million bucks, so naturally</i>

<i>Marcia and I were married... secretly. </i>
- <i>[Menzies] Yeah? </i>

674
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,434
<i>[Quinlan] A million bucks. </i>
<i>Ain't no secret about that. </i>

<i>You got scared he'd change his will. </i>
- <i>[Sanchez] Let up a minute. </i>

676
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:59,506
- <i>[Menzies] You broke into</i>
<i>the explosives bin and stole</i>...
- <i>[Sanchez] That's a lie! </i>

677
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:03,342
- <i>[Quinlan]</i>
<i>You stole ten sticks of dynamite! </i>
- <i>[Sanchez] No! No! </i>

a snake there in the bathroom,
it would have bitten me.

- <i>I promised Chief Gould</i>
<i>that I'd keep you informed. </i>

This is it.
We've broken the case.

683
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:23,128
Rudy Linnekar was blown up
with eight sticks of dynamite,
and Sanchez stole ten.

684
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,998
That leaves two,
and we found 'em both.

685
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:30,301
You heard that, boy.
We found the dynamite.

686
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,808
- That's impossible.
- We found two sticks.

687
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,810
- " Black Fox," the identical brand.
- The right number.

688
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:37,244
- Where did you find this? Where?
- Right here in your love nest.

689
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,908
- Where you had it stashed.
- What are you trying to do?

690
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,008
We're trying to strap you
to the electric chair, boy.

691
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,815
We don't like it when innocent people
are blown to jelly in our town.

692
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:48,790
Yes, an old lady on Main Street
last night picked up a shoe.

693
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:52,522
The shoe had a foot in it.
We're gonna make you pay for that mess.

694
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,030
- They're trying to railroad me.
I don't know why.
- Yeah.

695
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,999
I never stole any dynamite.
<i>Soy inocente. </i>

696
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,229

- You'll have to stop him yourself.

697
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:04,673
- [Speaking Spanish]
- From now on, he can talk Hindu
for all the good it'll do him.

698
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:10,111
He swears on his mother's grave
that there has never been
any dynamite in this apartment.

699
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,014
Sure. Sure.
Take him in. Book him.

700
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,314
Let's go.

701
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,581
- You say you found
this dynamite in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

702
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,283
- Pete found it.
Show him the dynamite, Pete.
- It's right here.

703
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,293
Can't you do something
to help me?

704
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,997
Oh, what're you scared of,
partner?

705
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:32,661
That stuff isn't nearly as easy
to blow up as people seem to think.

706
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:36,467
- It doesn't go off that easy.
- You found the dynamite in this box?

707
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,565
Dynamite?

708
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,237
Yeah. Pete found it.
We told you that.

709
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,042
- Captain.
- Yeah?

710
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,312
I looked in that box just now.

711
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:51,650
There wasn't anything there.

While you're looking at it,
perhaps you'll excuse me
if I finish a call I put in.

- Where'd you get this?

862
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:29,621
- From your department of records.
- Well, it doesn't mean anything.

- Yes.

865
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:36,631
- You know who owns the Mirador?
- No, l...

868

Quinlan needed dynamite to work

- Listen, Hank.

Vargas is telling the chief and the D.A.

No, I mean Sanchez.
Dynamite's no way to kill.

I was just a rookie cop.

- Perhaps what?

that Sanchez is guilty.
- There's no "perhaps" about it.

- Hank Quinlan is an honest cop.
- There are all kinds of policemen.

<i>a dollar in his life. </i>

<i>abuse their power in other ways. </i>

Uh... Huh!
I've heard it already.

934
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:50,042
Your friend Vargas has some very special
ideas about police procedure.

935
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:52,917
He seems to think it don't matter
whether killers hang or not,

936
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:56,117
- So long as we obey the rule books.
- I don't think a policeman...

937
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:59,161
- Should work like a dogcatcher
putting criminals behind bars.
- No?

938
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:03,688
- No. In any free country,
a policeman is to enforce the law,
- [Scoffs]

939
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:07,202
- And the law protects the guilty
as well as the innocent.
- Our job is tough enough.

940
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:10,000
It has to be tough.

941
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:14,941
A policeman's job is easy in
a police state. That's the whole point.

942
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:18,208
Who is the boss?
The cop or the law?

943
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,478
- Where's your wife, Vargas?
- What do you... What do you mean?

944
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:26,385
You know where she is. Sergeant Menzies
drove her. She's at the motel.

945
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:29,788
Oh? And you're still here?

946
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:34,125
Yes, I'm checking out now and joining
her. Do you have a reason for asking?

947
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:37,063
No. No special reason, no.

948
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:40,330
No, I just... wondered.

949
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:44,567
Oh, what do you know?
A mother pigeon and her nest.

950
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,873
- Pigeon egg. Hmm?
- Captain, you did buy
1 7 sticks of dynamite.

You tell your story.
I don't have to answer your questions.

952
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:57,008
- A hired hand at your ranch says
he used 1 5 sticks.
- My ranch?

953
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,656
You been spyin'

- A foreigner! Aah!
- Without my knowledge, Hank!

955
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,886
At your ranch you used
1 5 sticks of dynamite.
That leaves two sticks missing,

956
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,490
and two sticks were found
in that shoe box!

957
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,558

- Hank, wait a minute!

Thirty years. Thirty years

to answer him? No, sir!

- Oh!
- Hank, will you listen a minute?

967
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:47,931
I don't want ever to see that man
in headquarters for any reason!
You backed him up!

968
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,462
- Me?
- You stood by while he impugned
the integrity of Quinlan.

969
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:55,169
- I tried to stop him!
- Do you realize what Vargas has done?

970
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:58,805
- He's smearing hundreds of fine men!
- Are you satisfied?

971
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:03,250
Have you caused enough trouble? Are you
satisfied? I want you to apologize!

972
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,583
- To Quinlan?
- And to Chief Gould.

973
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,589
- Would you like me
to get down on my knees?
- If you have any decency, yes!

974
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:11,592

- Mr. Adair, I won't
give you the chance...

01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,094
to test your authority
in this matter.

976
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,869
Al... have I still
any credit left with you?

977
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:26,169
- Some.
- Tell me, where can
I find the records...

978
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,767

979
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:33,008
- I'll show you.
- I'd like to get back to my wife.
I hope this won't take too long.

980
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,016
- Hank.

981
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,348
You're not going
without this.

982
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:48,496
Well... now I guess
I can talk.

983
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,431
- What do you mean, Hank?
- All I wanted to tell you...

984
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,027
- Was I couldn't really say
in my own defense.
- Go on, Hank.

985
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,732
What do you really know
about this Vargas?

986
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,573
Isn't he in charge of some kind
of cleanup on this side of the border?

987
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:05,580
- Narcotics, mainly?
- Yeah. Narcotics.

988
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:10,312
He's a drug addict. He's got
that young wife of his hooked, too...

989
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,388
but good.

990
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:16,983
- If I hadn't seen
that hypodermic myself...
- Hypodermic? You saw it?

991
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,254
I just said so, didn't I?

992
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,262
[Quinlan Muttering]
I saw it.

993
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:26,097
That's how come he happened to imagine
all those crazy things. It's typical.

994
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:29,763
That's what that wife of his
was doin' in that dive on skid row.

995
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:35,175
Both a couple of junkies. Course,
he's usin' the job... as a cover-up.

- You sure you got enough?
- More than enough.
Play it back. You'll see.

1439
01:45:39,032 --> 01:45:41,660
- Susie!
- Mike!

1440
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:50,074
[Menzies] All these years
you've been playing me for a sucker,

1441
01:45:50,143 --> 01:45:55,171
- <i>faking evidence. </i>
- <i>[Quinlan] Aiding justice, partner. </i>

1442
01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:58,641
[Tana]
Hank!

1443
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:01,085
- Susie.
- Oh, Mike.

1444
01:46:02,222 --> 01:46:05,316
It's all over, Susie.
I'm taking you home.

1445
01:46:05,392 --> 01:46:09,829
- Home.
- [Engine Starts]

1446
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:12,023
- <i>[Tape Continues]</i>
- <i>How many did you frame? </i>

1447
01:46:12,099 --> 01:46:14,533
<i>Nobody that wasn't guilty. Guilty. </i>

1448
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:17,695
- Hank!
- <i>No, I ain't workin'for Vargas! </i>

1449
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:20,239
- <i>Vargas! Vargas! </i>
- <i>You better give me that gun. </i>

1450
01:46:20,307 --> 01:46:23,105
- <i>Okay, here it is. </i>
- Give it to me!

1451
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:25,110
- <i>Vargas! </i>
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>

1452
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:28,113
Pete...

1453
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:31,173
that's the second bullet l...
I stopped for you.

1454
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:57,777
His famous intuition was right
after all. He framed Sanchez.

1455
01:46:57,844 --> 01:47:01,871
<i>But he didn't even need to. </i>
<i>The kid confessed about that bomb. </i>

1456
01:47:01,948 --> 01:47:07,545
<i>So, it turns out</i>
<i>Quinlan was right after all. </i>

1457
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:12,558
- Isn't somebody going
to come and take him away?
- Yeah, in just a few minutes.

1458
01:47:12,626 --> 01:47:15,254
You really liked him,
didn't you?

1459
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:20,129
The cop did. The one who killed him.
He loved him.

1460
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:23,499
Well, Hank was
a great detective, all right.

1461
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:27,768
- And a lousy cop.
- Is that all you have to say for him?

1462
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:31,710
He was some kind of a man.

1463
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:37,850
What does it matter
what you say about people?

1464
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:46,558
<i>Good</i>-<i>bye, Tana. </i>

1465
01:47:47,527 --> 01:47:49,461
Adios.
