1
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,799
He will be saying prayers
in the garden.

2
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,739
Just follow the others.

3
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,740
He will be saying prayers
in the garden.

4
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,779
Just follow the others.

5
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,123
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

6
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,960
Oh, God!

7
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,480
The object of this massive tribute...

8
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,750
...died as he had always lived:

9
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,945
A private man...

10
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,351
...without wealth...

11
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,957
...without property...

12
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,651
...without official title or office.

13
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,164
Mahatma Gandhi...

14
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,230
...was not the commander of armies...

15
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,994
...nor a ruler of vast lands.

16
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,232
He could not boast
any scientific achievement...

17
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,203
...or artistic gift.

18
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,633
Yet men...

19
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:15,607
...governments, dignitaries
from all over the world...

20
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,749
...have joined hands today
to pay homage...

21
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,612
...to this little brown man
in the loincloth...

22
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,687
...who led his country to freedom.

23
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,884
In the words of
General George C. Marshall...

24
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,194
...the American Secretary of State:

25
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,630
"Mahatma Gandhi has become
the spokesman...

26
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,131
...for the conscience of all mankind.

27
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,565
He was a man...

28
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,238
...who made humility...

29
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,037
...and simple truth...

30
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,701
...more powerful than Empires."

31
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,479
And Albert Einstein added:

32
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,417
"Generations to come will scarce
believe that such a one as this...

33
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,745
...ever in flesh and blood...

34
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,350
...walked upon this earth."

35
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,231
Tell me...

36
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,866
...do you think about hell?

37
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,031
Neither do I.

38
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,334
But this man here...

39
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,979
...is a Christian, and he's written
that in order to believe...

40
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,243
Excuse me, sir.

41
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,943
How long have you been
in South Africa?

42
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,552
A week.

43
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,951
I don't know how you got a ticket.

44
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,986
Just what are you doing
in this car, coolie?

45
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,420
Why, I have a ticket.

46
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,989
A first-class ticket.

47
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,363
- How did you get it?
- I sent for it in the post.

48
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,902
I'm an attorney.
I didn't...

49
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,301
There are no colored attorneys
in South Africa.

50
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,736
Sit where you belong!

51
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,104
I'll take your luggage back, sir.

52
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,836
Just a moment, please.

53
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,207
You see...

54
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,175
...Mohandas K. Gandhi...

55
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,912
...Attorney at Law.

56
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,248
I'm on my way to Pretoria to conduct
a case for an Indian trading firm.

57
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,685
Didn't you hear me?

58
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,117
There are no colored attorneys
in South Africa.

59
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,761
I was called to the Bar in London...

60
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,200
...and enrolled at
the High Court of Chancery.

61
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,334
I am, therefore, an attorney.

62
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,094
And since I am,
in your eyes, colored...

63
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,599
...I think we can deduce
that there is at least...

64
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,673
...one colored attorney
in South Africa.

65
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,302
Smart, bloody Kaffir!

66
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,137
Throw him out.

67
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,748
Just move your black ass
back to third class.

68
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,249
Or I'll have you thrown off
at the next station.

69
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,351
But I always go first class!

70
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,883
But you're a rich man.
Why put up with it?

71
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,251
Yes, I am rich.

72
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,655
But I am Indian.

73
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,195
I do not expect
to travel first class.

74
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,833
- In England, I was a poor student.
- That was England.

75
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,730
This is part of England's Empire.

76
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:35,499
Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and
you see a successful Muslim trader.

77
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,575
Most South Africans see him
simply as an Indian.

78
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,680
And the vast majority of Indians,
mostly Hindus, like yourself...

79
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,680
...were brought here to
work mines and harvest crops.

80
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,410
Most Europeans don't want them
doing anything else.

81
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,179
But that is very unchristian...

82
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,482
Mr. Gandhi, in this country...

83
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,594
...lndians are not allowed to walk
along the pavement with a Christian.

84
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,695
You mean, you employ Mr. Baker
as your attorney...

85
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,529
...but you can't walk down
the street with him?

86
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,299
Well, I can.

87
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,775
But I risk being kicked
into the gutter by someone...

88
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,069
...less holy than Mr. Baker.

89
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,553
Well, then it must be fought.

90
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,157
We are children of God
like everyone else.

91
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,657
Allah be praised!

92
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,352
And what battalions
will you call upon?

93
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,259
I will write to the press...

94
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,734
...here and in England.

95
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,332
I will use the courts.

96
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,008
You'll cause a lot of trouble.
Our position is...

97
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,770
We are members of the Empire.

98
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,978
And we come from
an ancient civilization.

99
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,848
Why should we not walk on
the pavements like other men?

100
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,081
I rather like the idea of
an Indian barrister in South Africa.

101
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,417
I'm sure our community could
keep you in work for some time...

102
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,359
...even if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

103
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,930
Especially if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

104
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,925
There's the English reporter.
I told you he'd come.

105
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,356
You also said your article
would draw a thousand people.

106
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,528
At least some of the Hindus...

107
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,465
...brought their wives.

108
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,265
No, I asked my wife
to organize that.

109
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,200
Some of them are leaving.

110
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,911
Ladies and gentlemen...

111
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,422
...we have asked you to gather here
to help us proclaim our right...

112
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,720
...to be treated as equal citizens
of the Empire.

113
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,092
We do not seek conflict.

114
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,291
We know the strength of
the forces arrayed against us...

115
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,403
...know that because of them,
we can only use peaceful means.

116
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,873
But we are determined
that justice will be done.

117
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,271
The symbol of our status
is embodied in this pass...

118
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,782
...which we must carry
at all times...

119
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,887
...but which no European
even has to have.

120
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,024
The first step towards
changing our status...

121
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,384
...is to eliminate
this difference between us.

122
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,601
Now?

123
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,242
You write brilliantly, but you have
much to learn about handling men.

124
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,775
We do not want to ignite...

125
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,444
...the fear or hatred of anyone.

126
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,324
But we ask you...

127
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,684
...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...

128
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,896
...to help us light up the sky...

129
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,467
...and the minds of
the British authorities...

130
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,762
...with our defiance
of this injustice.

131
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,970
We will now burn the passes of
our committee and its supporters.

132
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,438
We ask you to put
your passes on the fire...

133
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,549
You bloody dog!

134
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:44,987
Those passes...

135
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,556
...are government property!

136
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,126
And I will arrest the first man
who tries to burn one!

137
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:04,970
Take him away.

138
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,092
You little...

139
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,758
...Sammy...

140
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,199
...bastard!

141
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,170
Now...

142
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:35,699
...are there anymore?

143
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,375
If you want this kind of trouble,
you can have it.

144
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,226
Let me go!

145
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,328
Let me go!

146
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,484
Stop.

147
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,145
The London papers have
arrived from the Cape.

148
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,781
<i>The worst was the Daily Mail.</i>

149
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,314
They said the burning of passes...

150
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,646
- Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.
- It was the most significant act...

151
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,119
...in colonial affairs since
the Declaration of Independence.

152
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,623
They'll find we're better
prepared this time.

153
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,955
Mr. Gandhi will find
he's on a long hiding to nothing.

154
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,499
"A High Court judge has confirmed
that Mr. Gandhi...

155
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,500
...would've been within his rights
to prosecute for assault...

156
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,004
...since neither he nor Mr. Khan
resisted arrest."

157
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,503
I told you about English law.

158
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,145
As I told you
about English policemen.

159
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,846
We're very pleased
to have you back, Papa.

160
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,187
And I am glad to be back.

161
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,620
Mind your face.

162
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,695
Tomorrow I'll tell you about
my days in a police hospital.

163
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,336
Come, come.

164
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,544
Just like proper English gentlemen.
I'm proud of them.

165
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,738
They're boys.

166
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,550
And they're Indian.

167
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,549
Will you take this off?
It pinches every time I speak.

168
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,090
I've got it.

169
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,738
You'd be Gandhi.

170
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,472
I thought you'd be bigger.

171
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:28,943
I'm sorry.

172
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,342
No, that's all right.

173
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,475
My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.

174
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,845
I've come from India.

175
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,556
I've read a great deal about you.

176
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,814
Some of it good, I hope.

177
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,090
Would you care to walk?

178
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,561
You're a clergyman?

179
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,701
I met some remarkable people in India.

180
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,929
And when I read what you were doing,
I wanted to help.

181
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,039
- Does that surprise you?
- Not anymore.

182
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,036
At first, I was amazed...

183
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,969
...but when you're fighting
in a just cause...

184
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,514
...people seem to pop up, like you,
right out of the pavement.

185
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,484
Even when it's dangerous or...

186
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,350
Hey, look what's coming!

187
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,050
A white shepherd leading
a brown Sammy!

188
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,620
Perhaps we should...

189
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,393
Doesn't the New Testament say:

190
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,092
"If your enemy strikes you on
the right cheek, offer him the left"?

191
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,829
The phrase was used metaphorically.
I don't think our Lord...

192
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,302
I'm not so sure.

193
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,976
I have thought about it a great deal.

194
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,042
I suspect He meant
you must show courage...

195
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,547
...be willing to take a blow,
several blows, to show...

196
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,377
...you won't strike back,
nor will you be turned aside.

197
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,545
And when you do that, it calls on
something in human nature...

198
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,214
...that makes his hatred for you
decrease and his respect increase.

199
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,885
I think Christ grasped that,
and I have seen it work.

200
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,229
Good morning.

201
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,831
Get off the pavement,
you bloody coon.

202
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,365
- Yeah, get off.
- Kaffir!

203
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,828
Colin, what are you doing?

204
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,937
Nothing.

205
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,041
Come out where I can see you!

206
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,281
I said, what are you doing?

207
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,512
We were just trying to clean up
the neighborhood.

208
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,950
You're late for work.
I thought you'd gone ten minutes ago.

209
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,254
Get on!

210
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,230
You'll find there's room for us all.

211
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,640
- That was lucky.
- I thought you were a man of God.

212
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,004
I am, but I'm not
so egotistical as to think...

213
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,077
...He plans His day
around my dilemmas.

214
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,450
You could call it
a communal farm, I suppose.

215
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,122
But you've all come
to the same conclusions.

216
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,917
Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran,
your Bible.

217
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,289
It's always the simple things
that catch your breath.

218
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,927
"Love thy neighbor as thyself."

219
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,091
Not always practiced...

220
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,634
...but it's something we Hindus
could learn a lot from.

221
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,465
That's the kind of thing
you'll be seeking on this farm?

222
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,301
Well, we shall try.

223
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,374
Bad news, I'm afraid.

224
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,103
They're going to change the pass laws.

225
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,018
It's taken time...

226
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,547
...but it needed to be done fairly.

227
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,156
We didn't want to create an injustice
simply because Mr. Gandhi...

228
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,919
...was abusing our
existing legislation.

229
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,096
Just one moment, sir, please.

230
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,434
I beg your pardon.

231
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,027
But on a short trip...

232
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,005
...I wouldn't spend too much time
on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.

233
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,177
It's a tiny factor
in South African life.

234
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,815
Well, it is news at the moment.

235
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,644
I plan to report on the
condition of the mines here...

236
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,820
...as well as the economy.

237
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,388
But I would like to meet
this Mr. Gand-eye.

238
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,291
Gandhi.

239
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,758
Of course.
We Westerners have a weakness...

240
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,659
...for these spiritually inclined
men of India.

241
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,792
But as an old lawyer,
let me warn you.

242
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,128
Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man
as you will ever meet...

243
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,035
...however otherworldly he may seem.

244
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,904
But I'm sure you're enough
of a reporter to see that.

245
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,910
I hope so.
Thank you for your time, sir.

246
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,050
So it's not spiritualism
or nationalism.

247
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,916
We're not resisting anything...

248
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,422
...but the idea that people
can't live together.

249
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,888
You see?

250
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,458
Hindus, Muslims...

251
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,632
...Sikhs, Jews...

252
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,424
...even Christians.

253
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,095
<i>Mr. Walker of the New York Times.</i>

254
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,293
How you doing?

255
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,067
Without a paper,
a journal of some kind...

256
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,335
...you cannot unite a community.

257
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,514
You belong to a
very important profession.

258
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,552
And what do you think an important
professional should write...

259
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:06,315
...about your response to
General Smuts' newest legislation?

260
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,152
I don't know.

261
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm still searching for a response.

262
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,126
You will respect the law?

263
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:18,462
There are unjust laws
as there are unjust men.

264
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,866
You're a small minority to take on
the South African government...

265
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,871
...not to mention the British Empire.

266
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,307
If you are a minority of one...

267
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,909
...the truth is the truth.

268
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,148
Herman Kallenbach...

269
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,253
...our chief carpenter,
also our chief benefactor.

270
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,389
<i>Vince Walker, New York Times.</i>

271
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,421
This is quite a place
you've got here.

272
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,619
And you call it an ashram?

273
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,696
That's right.
The word only means "community."

274
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,299
But it could stand for
"village" or "the world."

275
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,766
You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.

276
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,495
I hope not.

277
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:01,502
I hear that you also prepare
the meals and clean the toilets.

278
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,477
- Is that part of the experiment?
- Ba!

279
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,184
We will need another place set
for Mr. Walker's driver.

280
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,714
I will tell Tara.

281
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:17,318
Yes, it's one way to learn
that each man's labor...

282
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,360
...is as important as another's.

283
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,691
While you're doing it,
cleaning the toilet...

284
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,198
...seems far more important
than the law.

285
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,465
Please, come and join us.

286
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,333
You'll need something before
your journey back.

287
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,403
- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yeah, sure.

288
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,050
What is it?

289
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,925
Sora was sent to tell me I must...

290
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,355
...rake and cover the latrine.

291
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,790
That's right.

292
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,825
Everyone takes their turn.

293
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,431
It is the work of untouchables!

294
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,603
In this place,
there are no untouchables.

295
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,772
And no work is beneath any of us.

296
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,734
I'm your wife!

297
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,772
All the more reason.

298
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,977
As you command.

299
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,310
The others may follow you,
but you forget...

300
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,984
...I knew you when you were a boy.

301
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,680
It's not me.

302
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,417
It's the principle.

303
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,219
And you will do it with joy
or not do it at all.

304
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,090
Not at all then.

305
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,831
All right then, go.
You don't belong here!

306
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,408
Leave the ashram altogether.
We don't want you!

307
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,338
Have you no shame?

308
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,070
I'm your wife!

309
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,458
Where do you expect me to go?

310
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,064
What's the matter with me?

311
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,407
You're human.

312
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,977
Only human.

313
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,910
And it's even harder
for those of us...

314
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:22,848
...who do not even want to be
as good as you do.

315
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,449
I apologize.

316
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,134
I must get back to that reporter.

317
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,398
And I must...

318
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,436
...rake and cover the latrine.

319
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,862
I want to welcome you all.

320
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,063
Every one of you.

321
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,702
We have no secrets.

322
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,818
Let us begin by being clear...

323
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,751
...about General Smuts' new law.

324
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,888
All Indians must now
be fingerprinted...

325
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,062
...like criminals.

326
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,157
Men and women.

327
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,324
No marriage other than a Christian
marriage is considered valid.

328
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,060
Under this act...

329
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,098
...our wives and mothers are whores.

330
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,935
And every man here is a bastard.

331
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,848
He has become quite good at this.

332
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,678
And a policeman...

333
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,151
...passing an Indian dwelling...

334
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,260
...I will not call them homes...

335
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,455
...may enter and demand the card of any
Indian woman whose dwelling it is.

336
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,657
Goddamn them!

337
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,227
Understand...

338
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,967
...he does not have to
stand at the door.

339
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,802
He may enter.

340
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,410
I will not allow it!

341
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,404
I swear to Allah.

342
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:35,119
I'll kill the man who offers
that insult to my home and my wife...

343
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,622
...and let them hang me!

344
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,727
I say: Talk means nothing!

345
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:51,065
Kill a few officials before
they disgrace one Indian woman.

346
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,932
Then they might think twice
about such laws.

347
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,133
In that cause,
I would be willing to die!

348
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,380
I praise such courage.

349
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,318
I need such courage...

350
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,857
...because, in this cause,
I too am prepared to die.

351
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,586
But, my friend...

352
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,926
...there is no cause for which
I am prepared to kill.

353
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,798
Whatever they do to us...

354
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,996
...we will attack no one...

355
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,107
...kill no one.

356
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,211
But we will not give
our fingerprints, not one of us.

357
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,006
They will imprison us.
They will fine us.

358
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,184
They will seize our possessions.

359
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,745
But they cannot take away
our self-respect...

360
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,445
...if we do not give it to them.

361
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,682
Have you been to prison?

362
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,126
They beat us and torture us.
I say...

363
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,398
I am asking you to fight.

364
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,294
To fight against their anger,
not to provoke it.

365
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,566
We will not strike a blow.

366
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,437
But we will receive them.

367
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,272
And through our pain...

368
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,974
...we will make them see
their injustice.

369
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,811
And it will hurt...

370
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,411
...as all fighting hurts.

371
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,252
But we cannot lose.

372
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,058
We cannot.

373
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,564
They may torture my body...

374
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,427
...break my bones...

375
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,295
...even kill me.

376
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,764
Then...

377
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,804
...they will have my dead body...

378
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,209
...not my obedience.

379
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,299
We are Hindu and Muslim...

380
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,932
...children of God, each one of us.

381
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,868
Let us take a solemn oath
in His name...

382
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,736
...that, come what may...

383
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,179
...we will not submit to this law.

384
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,854
<i>God save our gracious King</i>

385
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,029
<i>God save our noble King</i>

386
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,368
<i>God save our King</i>

387
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,093
These men are contracted laborers.

388
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,770
They belong in the mines.

389
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,405
You put their comrades in jail.

390
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,505
When you free them...

391
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,005
...they will go back to work.

392
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,277
I've warned you.

393
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,571
We've warned each other.

394
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,349
I don't think that's very good.

395
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,200
Steady, steady.

396
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,039
Stop!

397
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,981
At the canter, charge!

398
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,121
We should lie down.

399
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,157
Down!

400
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,156
The horses won't trample on us.
Lie down!

401
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,534
Follow me!

402
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,321
Now what the hell do we do?

403
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,996
Let them march.

404
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,867
In our own sweet time,
in our own sweet way...

405
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,636
...we'll get them.

406
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,402
One law!

407
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,635
One king!

408
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:15,870
One law!

409
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,274
One king!

410
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,010
Some of you may be rejoicing
that Mr. Gandhi...

411
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,053
...has at last been put into prison.

412
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,987
But I would ask you, assembled
here in this house of God...

413
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,998
...to recognize that we are
witnessing something new...

414
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,599
...something so unexpected,
so unusual...

415
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,636
...that it is not surprising
the government is at a loss.

416
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,732
What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do...

417
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,639
...is ask questions about ourselves.

418
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:54,007
As Christians, those are
difficult questions to answer.

419
00:35:55,786 --> 00:36:00,553
How do we treat men
who defy an unjust law...

420
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,656
...who will not fight...

421
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,523
...but will not comply?

422
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,056
As Christians or as people
who have not heard the word of...

423
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,409
They're sparing no one, I see.

424
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,651
No, you were the surprise.

425
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,119
It has been all over the prison.

426
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,450
We thought they'd be too afraid
of the English press.

427
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,752
So did I.

428
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,865
I don't know who they've
left out there to do the work.

429
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,231
Have they touched the women?

430
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:56,812
My wife publicly defied the law.
They've arrested her and four others.

431
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,048
It split the government.

432
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,741
Well, that's one victory.

433
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,944
If we hold firm,
it won't be the last.

434
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,783
Don't worry.

435
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,721
I've never seen men so determined.

436
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,191
You have given them a way to fight.

437
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,493
Gandhi!

438
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,602
I want Gandhi!

439
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,739
Which Sammy is it?

440
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,512
Mr. Gandhi.

441
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,584
I thought we might have
a little talk.

442
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,679
Thank you, Daniels.

443
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,052
Will you have a glass of sherry?

444
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,162
Thank you, no.

445
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,520
Perhaps some tea?

446
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,664
I dined at the prison.

447
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,136
Please.

448
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,898
Do come and sit down.

449
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,519
I've more or less decided to ask
the House to repeal the act...

450
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,219
...that you have taken
such exception to.

451
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:58,001
Well, if you asked, General Smuts,
I'm sure it will be done.

452
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,461
It's not quite that simple.

453
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,932
Somehow, I expected not.

454
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,971
I thought of calling for
a royal commission...

455
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,338
...to investigate the new legislation.

456
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,649
I think I could guarantee they would
recommend the act be repealed.

457
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,842
I congratulate them.

458
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,644
But they might also recommend...

459
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:21,182
...that all future Indian immigration
be severely restricted...

460
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,392
...even stopped.

461
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,599
Immigration was not an issue
on which we fought.

462
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,605
It would be wrong of us
to make it one now that we...

463
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,737
We are in a position of advantage.

464
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,213
I'm ordering the release of all
prisoners within the next 24 hours.

465
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,056
You yourself are free
as from this moment.

466
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,137
Assuming we are in agreement.

467
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,609
It's just that in these clothes,
I would prefer...

468
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,335
...to go by taxi.

469
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,671
All right. Fine.

470
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,575
I'm afraid I have no money.

471
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,315
Neither have I.

472
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,817
I'm awfully sorry.

473
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,256
Daniels...

474
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,587
...will you lend Mr. Gandhi
a shilling for a taxi?

475
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,931
I beg your pardon, sir?

476
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,026
How far will you be going, Gandhi?

477
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,797
Now that this is settled, I'd thought
seriously of going back to India.

478
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,939
But a shilling will do splendidly
for the moment.

479
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,580
Thank you.

480
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,426
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...

481
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,256
...but I can find my own way out.

482
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,842
Guard of honor!

483
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,745
Guard of honor!

484
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,745
Attention!

485
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,302
Present arms!

486
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,573
- My God, he loves it!
- I'm sure he hates it.

487
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,009
Generals' reputations are
being made in France today...

488
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,910
...fighting on the Western front.

489
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,080
Not as military governors in India.

490
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,921
What the devil's going on back there?

491
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,891
Must be that Indian who made
all that fuss in Africa.

492
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,062
My cabin boy told me he was on board.

493
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,593
There he is.

494
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,497
God, he's dressed like a coolie!

495
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,266
I thought he was a lawyer.

496
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,098
Mr. Gandhi, have you refused
to wear European clothes?

497
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,876
No, I haven't refused.

498
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:31,240
I simply wanted to dress the way
my comrades in prison dress.

499
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,245
Will you support the war effort?

500
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:38,251
If I wish to enjoy the benefits
and protection of the British Empire...

501
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,981
...it would be wrong of me
not to help in its defense.

502
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,592
Now that you're back in India
what are you going to do?

503
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:45,954
I don't know.

504
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,959
- I don't know.
- One more question.

505
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,964
As an Indian woman, how could you
accept the indignity of prison?

506
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:55,161
My dignity comes
from following my husband.

507
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,737
Thank you very much.

508
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,441
Just a few words, then we'll
get you to civilization.

509
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,673
May I?

510
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,924
I'm glad to be home...

511
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,437
...and I thank you for your greeting.

512
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,554
I'll follow with your wife.

513
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,487
Don't worry.
Everything's arranged.

514
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,692
Who's that young man?

515
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,195
That's young Nehru.

516
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,028
He's got his father's intellect,
his mother's good looks...

517
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,703
...and the devil's own charm.

518
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,466
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge.
Wave, wave!

519
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,677
He might amount to something.

520
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,277
I must say, when I first saw you...

521
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,114
...as a bumbling lawyer
here in Bombay...

522
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,483
...I never thought I'd greet you
as a national hero.

523
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,816
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

524
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,493
Yes, you are!

525
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,424
It's been two hundred years
since an Indian cocked a snook...

526
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,293
...at the British Empire
and got away with it.

527
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:35,063
And stop calling me Mr. Patel.
You're not a junior clerk anymore.

528
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:04,128
The new military governor of the
Northwest Province was on that ship.

529
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,632
Too bad you came back third class.

530
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,327
He might have been impressed...

531
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,997
...by a successful barrister
who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.

532
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,942
Yes, I'm sure.

533
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,391
Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?

534
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,924
No. I leave practical matters
to my husband...

535
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,461
...and revolution to my son.

536
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,635
Mr. Gandhi, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...

537
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,804
...member of Congress and leader
of the Muslim League...

538
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:43,370
How do you do?

539
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,838
...and Mr. Prakash, who, I fear...

540
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,376
...is awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder.

541
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,905
I have not actually pulled
the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.

542
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,448
I have simply written...

543
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,950
...if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law...

544
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,180
...it is an Indian's duty
to kill an Englishman...

545
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,915
...for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his.

546
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,726
It's a clever argument. I'm not sure
it'll produce the end you desire.

547
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:11,424
We hope you'll join us in our
struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.

548
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:15,695
Excuse me. May I, Mohan?
There's someone I'd like him to meet.

549
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:16,997
Excuse me.

550
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,836
Sorry to rush you.

551
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,740
He told the press
he'd support the British in the war.

552
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,609
That's nonviolence for you.

553
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:29,342
You know, Mohan...

554
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,182
...now I have a confession to make.

555
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,091
I didn't decide to come
to South Africa.

556
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,283
Professor Gokhale sent me.

557
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,490
We are trying to make a nation, Gandhi.

558
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,394
But the British keep trying
to break us up...

559
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,366
...into religions,
principalities, provinces.

560
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,702
What you were writing in South Africa...

561
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,307
...that's what we need here.

562
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,444
I have so much to learn about India.

563
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,738
And I have to begin my practice again.

564
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,915
One needs money to run a journal.

565
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,677
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie,
This is Indian talk.

566
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,856
We want none of you imperialists here.

567
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,824
All right, I'll go
and write my report to the Viceroy.

568
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,529
You go and find a pretty Hindu woman...

569
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,629
...and convert her to Christianity.

570
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,426
That's as much mischief
as you're allowed.

571
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,765
Come, let's find a quiet corner.

572
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,671
Now, you forget about your practice.

573
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,003
You have other things to do.

574
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,442
India has many men
with too much wealth.

575
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,776
And it's their privilege to nourish
the effort of the few...

576
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,889
...who can raise India
from servitude and apathy.

577
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,817
I'll see to it.

578
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,619
You begin your journal.

579
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,091
I have little to say.

580
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,162
Come, let's sit down.

581
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,459
India is an alien country to me.

582
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,101
Change that.

583
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,097
Go and find India.

584
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,206
Not what you see here...

585
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,433
...but the real India.

586
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,006
You'll see what needs to be said...

587
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,945
...what we need to hear.

588
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,848
When I saw you in that tunic, I knew.

589
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,864
I knew I could die in peace.

590
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:24,965
Make India proud of herself.

591
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,276
Charlie, please.
You're both being foolish.

592
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,639
But the air is lovely.
Anyway, there's no room in there.

593
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,748
Please. Come in.

594
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,417
No violence, please.

595
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,816
Let me hang on with two hands
or I will fall.

596
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,449
Englishman-sahib!

597
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,823
Come, there is room up here!

598
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:13,959
Put your foot on the window.

599
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,495
Come!

600
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,274
- What are you doing?
- I'm going nearer to God.

601
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,571
Charlie! Be careful!

602
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,912
Let go!

603
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,240
Let go!

604
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,514
- Let go!
- Oh, dear!

605
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,194
Hello.

606
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,063
You see?
It is most comfortable.

607
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,333
Sahib?

608
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,032
Are you a Christian?

609
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,468
Yes, I'm a Christian.

610
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,540
I know a Christian.

611
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,539
She drinks blood.

612
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,208
Blood of Christ,
every Sunday.

613
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,577
Charlie!

614
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,158
It's all right, sahib.
It's very safe.

615
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,897
Bend!

616
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,065
Pray to God, sahib.

617
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,737
Now is when it is best to be Hindu.

618
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,133
I agree with Jinnah.

619
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,702
Now that the Americans are in,
the war will be over soon.

620
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,410
The Germans are worn out as it is.

621
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,381
And our first act should be...

622
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,680
...to convene
a congress party convention...

623
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,112
...and demand independence.

624
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,291
And we will speak with one voice.

625
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,515
United.

626
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,853
And we should invite Gandhi.

627
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:55,860
What the devil's happened to him?

628
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,264
He's discovering India.

629
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,162
A lot better than making trouble
where it matters!

630
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,430
Invite him, let him say his piece
about South Africa...

631
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,835
...then let him slip into oblivion.

632
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,033
Insurgents.

633
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,036
They've derailed a troop train.

634
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,301
Keep clear!
Come on.

635
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,714
They've killed an English soldier.

636
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:02,429
<i>We were asked for toleration.</i>

637
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,695
We were asked for patience.

638
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,900
Some of us gave it...

639
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,265
...and some did not.

640
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,107
Their war is over.

641
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,545
And those of us who supported it...

642
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,306
...and those of us who refused...

643
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,178
...must forget our differences.

644
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,413
And there can be no excuses...

645
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,955
...from the British now.

646
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,058
India wants...

647
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,694
...home rule.

648
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:34,919
India...

649
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,988
...demands home rule!

650
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,708
Congratulations.

651
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,830
And let no one question...

652
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,056
...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...

653
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,428
...not just for the Muslims...

654
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,762
...but for all India!

655
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,211
And now...

656
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,711
...l'm going to introduce to you...

657
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,917
...a man whose writings...

658
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,176
...we are all becoming familiar with.

659
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,584
A man who stood in high esteem
with our own beloved Gokhale.

660
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,519
A man whose
accomplishments...

661
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,253
...in South Africa will
always be remembered.

662
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,555
Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!

663
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,759
Your journal has made great impact.

664
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,334
I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.

665
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,631
I would be even more flattered
if what he said were true.

666
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,103
But it is true.

667
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,004
I read it. Often!

668
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,151
Since I returned from South Africa...

669
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,064
...I have traveled over much of India.

670
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:20,829
And I know that I could travel
for many more years...

671
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,301
...and still only see
a small part of her.

672
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:27,169
And yet, I already know...

673
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,275
...that what we say here...

674
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:33,346
...means nothing to
the masses of our country.

675
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,520
Here, we make speeches
for each other...

676
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:42,317
...and those English liberal magazines
that may grant us a few lines.

677
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,995
But the people of India...

678
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,458
...are...

679
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,530
...untouched.

680
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,665
Their politics are confined to bread...

681
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,336
...and salt.

682
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:58,966
Illiterate they may be,
but they're not blind.

683
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:02,474
They see no reason to give their
loyalty to rich and powerful men...

684
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,806
...who simply want to take over
the role of the British...

685
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,880
...in the name of freedom.

686
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:12,385
This congress tells the world...

687
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,817
...it represents India.

688
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,153
My brothers...

689
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:18,720
...lndia...

690
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:22,227
...is 700,000 villages...

691
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,563
...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...

692
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,228
...and Bombay.

693
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,634
Until we stand in the fields...

694
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:35,777
...with the millions that toil
each day under the hot sun...

695
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:39,809
...we will not represent India.

696
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,678
Nor will we ever be able
to challenge the British...

697
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,949
...as one nation.

698
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,749
Have you read his magazine?

699
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:06,484
No.

700
00:59:07,226 --> 00:59:08,818
But I think I'm going to.

701
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:14,830
Pull over.

702
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:16,659
This can't be the way.

703
00:59:16,902 --> 00:59:20,599
Yes, I'm sure this is
the direction India is taking.

704
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,570
To think I almost got
excited by Mr. Jinnah...

705
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,903
...when all this was awaiting me.

706
00:59:46,098 --> 00:59:47,861
We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.

707
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:53,494
- You'll find him under that tree.
- Thank you.

708
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:56,972
I'm anxious to meet this new force.

709
00:59:57,409 --> 01:00:00,572
I try to live like an Indian,
as you see.

710
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:02,371
It's stupid, of course.

711
01:00:03,148 --> 01:00:04,638
Because in our country...

712
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,444
...it is the British who decide
how an Indian lives...

713
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:10,551
...what he may buy, what he may sell.

714
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:12,451
And from their luxury...

715
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:14,315
...in the midst of...

716
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,555
...our terrible poverty...

717
01:00:17,496 --> 01:00:21,091
...they instruct us on
what is justice, what is sedition.

718
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,361
So it's only natural
that our best young minds...

719
01:00:25,571 --> 01:00:28,039
...assume an air of Eastern dignity...

720
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,369
...while greedily assimilating...

721
01:00:30,576 --> 01:00:34,410
...every Western weakness as quickly
as they can acquire it.

722
01:00:37,783 --> 01:00:39,444
If we have home rule...

723
01:00:40,185 --> 01:00:41,311
...that'll change.

724
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:46,324
Would you, please?

725
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:51,023
Why should the British
grant us home rule?

726
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:55,560
Here, we must take
the peelings to the goats.

727
01:00:56,134 --> 01:01:00,571
We only make wild speeches or
perform even wilder acts of terrorism.

728
01:01:00,973 --> 01:01:02,440
We've bred an army of anarchists...

729
01:01:02,641 --> 01:01:06,509
...but not one single group that can
really fight the British anywhere.

730
01:01:08,347 --> 01:01:10,247
But I thought you were
against fighting.

731
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:11,677
Now...

732
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:13,214
...just spread it around.

733
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:14,911
There you are.

734
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:19,451
They like the new peelings
mixed in with the rotting ones.

735
01:01:21,593 --> 01:01:24,756
Where there's injustice,
I always believed in fighting.

736
01:01:25,531 --> 01:01:29,331
The question is, do you fight
to change things or to punish?

737
01:01:29,535 --> 01:01:33,403
I've found we're all such sinners
we should leave punishment to God.

738
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:36,267
And if we really want
to change things...

739
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:39,036
...there are better ways
of doing it...

740
01:01:39,311 --> 01:01:42,644
...than derailing trains
or slashing someone with a sword.

741
01:01:42,848 --> 01:01:44,076
The fire is ready.

742
01:01:45,717 --> 01:01:46,547
You see...

743
01:01:46,752 --> 01:01:47,810
...even here...

744
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:50,648
...we live under tyranny.

745
01:01:57,362 --> 01:01:58,795
What did I tell you?

746
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:00,161
Look at him!

747
01:02:00,899 --> 01:02:03,299
I can see the British shaking now.

748
01:02:22,888 --> 01:02:25,049
I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.

749
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:31,318
I've been trying to speak
to you for a long time.

750
01:02:33,632 --> 01:02:34,826
Our crops.

751
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:37,296
We cannot sell them.

752
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:39,935
We have no money.

753
01:02:40,505 --> 01:02:43,338
But the landlords still
demand the same rent.

754
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,775
We have nothing left.

755
01:03:30,522 --> 01:03:31,546
Mr. Taylor, sir.

756
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:32,746
Up here!

757
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,871
Jesus.

758
01:03:47,973 --> 01:03:49,804
What the hell is going on?

759
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:51,735
I don't know, sir.

760
01:03:57,115 --> 01:03:58,673
The agent got a telegram.

761
01:03:58,884 --> 01:04:02,684
And it just said, "He is coming"
and gave the time of the train.

762
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,123
Who the hell is "he"?

763
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:12,962
I don't know, sir.

764
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:31,873
Make way!

765
01:04:37,322 --> 01:04:39,153
Out of the way.
Come on, you!

766
01:04:44,162 --> 01:04:45,322
Who the devil are you?

767
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:48,226
My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.

768
01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:50,162
Whoever you are,
we don't want you here.

769
01:04:50,902 --> 01:04:53,427
I suggest you get back on
that train before it leaves.

770
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:55,606
They seem to want me.

771
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,899
Now, look here.

772
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:59,077
I'll put you under arrest,
if you'd prefer.

773
01:05:00,178 --> 01:05:01,270
On what charge?

774
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:07,209
I don't want any trouble.

775
01:05:07,419 --> 01:05:10,013
I'm an Indian traveling
in my own country.

776
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:12,087
I see no reason for trouble.

777
01:05:14,593 --> 01:05:16,561
Well, there had better not be.

778
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:22,693
Make way for the officer.

779
01:05:42,554 --> 01:05:44,215
For years...

780
01:05:44,723 --> 01:05:46,987
...the landlords have ordered us...

781
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:48,523
...to grow indigo...

782
01:05:49,227 --> 01:05:50,558
...for dyeing cloth.

783
01:05:51,496 --> 01:05:55,398
Always, they took part
of the crop as rent.

784
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:57,559
But now...

785
01:05:58,103 --> 01:06:01,163
...everyone buys their cloth
from England.

786
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:03,534
So no one wants...

787
01:06:04,075 --> 01:06:05,474
...our indigo.

788
01:06:06,745 --> 01:06:07,905
The landlords...

789
01:06:08,346 --> 01:06:11,008
...say we must pay our rent...

790
01:06:11,216 --> 01:06:12,706
...in cash.

791
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:16,084
What we could...

792
01:06:16,588 --> 01:06:17,714
...we sold.

793
01:06:18,423 --> 01:06:21,187
The police have taken the rest.

794
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:22,992
There is...

795
01:06:23,295 --> 01:06:24,626
...no food.

796
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:27,590
I understand.

797
01:06:30,969 --> 01:06:32,402
The landlords are British?

798
01:06:42,848 --> 01:06:44,839
What we can do, we will try to do.

799
01:07:05,036 --> 01:07:06,094
Shukla...

800
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:08,900
...is all Champaran like this?

801
01:07:09,441 --> 01:07:10,999
Yes, Bapu.

802
01:07:11,209 --> 01:07:13,006
The whole region.

803
01:07:13,478 --> 01:07:14,706
Hundreds.

804
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:15,743
Thousands.

805
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:20,850
Some landlords have tried to help.

806
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:22,914
But what can they do?

807
01:07:38,103 --> 01:07:40,230
Are you Mr. M. K. Gandhi?

808
01:07:41,172 --> 01:07:43,140
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

809
01:07:43,975 --> 01:07:45,408
I'm not sorry at all.

810
01:07:55,754 --> 01:07:58,245
Who did you say
would be buying the drinks?

811
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,059
Oh, no!

812
01:08:09,534 --> 01:08:13,334
Wouldn't you know, that's the best
innings I've had since Oxford.

813
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:15,233
India's full of grief, old man.

814
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,372
I've got no idea.

815
01:08:16,641 --> 01:08:20,338
All I know is there's a riot or
something at Motihari in Champaran.

816
01:08:20,545 --> 01:08:21,842
The whole company's ordered out.

817
01:08:39,798 --> 01:08:41,527
I would like to see the prisoner.

818
01:08:53,278 --> 01:08:54,540
On the left, sir.

819
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:06,680
Shades of South Africa.

820
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:08,050
Not quite.

821
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,018
They're only holding me...

822
01:09:10,228 --> 01:09:12,321
...until the magistrate's hearing.

823
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,327
Then it will be prison.

824
01:09:17,268 --> 01:09:19,065
Did they take your clothes?

825
01:09:20,538 --> 01:09:22,267
These are my clothes now.

826
01:09:24,175 --> 01:09:27,269
You always had a puritanical streak.

827
01:09:28,046 --> 01:09:30,037
If I want to be one with them...

828
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:31,938
...I have to live like them.

829
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,447
Yes, I think you do.

830
01:09:34,652 --> 01:09:36,643
But thank God we all don't.

831
01:09:36,988 --> 01:09:38,956
My puritanism runs in a different way.

832
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:41,192
I'm far too modest for such a display.

833
01:09:47,499 --> 01:09:50,662
Couldn't I be let in with
the prisoner? I am a clergyman.

834
01:10:04,182 --> 01:10:05,843
They're calling you "Bapu."

835
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:07,712
I thought it meant "father."

836
01:10:08,286 --> 01:10:09,548
It does.

837
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:12,882
We must be getting old, Charlie.

838
01:10:16,161 --> 01:10:17,423
What do you want me to do?

839
01:10:20,932 --> 01:10:22,729
I think that you can help us most...

840
01:10:22,934 --> 01:10:26,335
...by taking that assignment
you've been offered in Fiji.

841
01:10:29,474 --> 01:10:31,408
I have to be sure...

842
01:10:31,976 --> 01:10:34,137
They have to be sure
that what we do...

843
01:10:34,345 --> 01:10:37,508
...can be done by Indians alone.

844
01:10:49,294 --> 01:10:50,761
But you know the strategy.

845
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:54,454
The world is full of people who
will despise what's happening here.

846
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:56,429
It is their strength that we need.

847
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:58,033
Before you go...

848
01:10:58,803 --> 01:11:01,465
...you could start us
in the right direction.

849
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,841
I must leave from Calcutta...

850
01:11:14,953 --> 01:11:16,113
...and soon.

851
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:20,985
Say goodbye to Ba for me.

852
01:11:25,897 --> 01:11:26,989
Well, I...

853
01:11:28,733 --> 01:11:31,201
There are no goodbyes for us.

854
01:11:32,203 --> 01:11:35,297
Wherever you are,
you will always be in my heart.

855
01:11:56,427 --> 01:11:58,224
I'm going to clear the courtroom.

856
01:11:58,429 --> 01:11:59,828
I'm not sure we'd be able to.

857
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:02,295
It is a first hearing.
It's supposed to be public.

858
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,967
And he's a lawyer.

859
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,301
I don't know where
they found the nerve.

860
01:12:07,505 --> 01:12:10,599
I don't either, but the troops
won't be here till tomorrow.

861
01:12:10,808 --> 01:12:13,276
How did the press get here
before the military?

862
01:12:13,478 --> 01:12:16,709
That English clergyman sent
a number of telegrams yesterday.

863
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:19,577
I understand one of them
even went to the Viceroy.

864
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:35,122
You have been ordered
out of the province...

865
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,858
...on the grounds
of disturbing the peace.

866
01:12:44,509 --> 01:12:46,636
With respect, I refuse to go.

867
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:51,415
Do you want to go to jail?

868
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,378
As you wish.

869
01:12:58,856 --> 01:12:59,754
All right.

870
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,756
I will release you on bail...

871
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:06,362
...of 100 rupees
until I reach a sentence.

872
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:11,995
I refuse to pay 100 rupees.

873
01:13:22,413 --> 01:13:24,347
Then I will grant release on bail...

874
01:13:24,549 --> 01:13:27,985
...without payment
until I reach a decision.

875
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:55,805
Gandhiji! Gandhiji!

876
01:14:02,387 --> 01:14:03,615
We are from Bihar.

877
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,354
We received a cable
from an old friend...

878
01:14:06,557 --> 01:14:08,252
...who was at Cambridge with us.

879
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:09,790
His name is Nehru.

880
01:14:10,061 --> 01:14:12,086
- I believe you know him.
- Indeed.

881
01:14:12,297 --> 01:14:15,755
He tells us you need help,
and we have come to give it.

882
01:14:17,702 --> 01:14:22,435
I want to document coldly, rationally,
what is being done here.

883
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,937
It may take months.

884
01:14:24,142 --> 01:14:25,700
We have no pressing engagements.

885
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:28,504
You will have to live
with the peasants.

886
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,908
There will be risks.

887
01:14:50,168 --> 01:14:51,829
I don't know what
this country is coming to.

888
01:14:52,036 --> 01:14:52,934
But good God, man!

889
01:14:53,137 --> 01:14:56,971
You yourself raised the rent simply
to finance a hunting expedition.

890
01:14:58,109 --> 01:15:01,636
And some of these others:
Beatings, illegal seizures...

891
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,048
...demanding services without pay.

892
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:06,443
Even refusing them water.

893
01:15:07,118 --> 01:15:08,551
In India!

894
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:11,586
Nobody knows what it is to try
to get these people to work.

895
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:13,984
You've made this half-naked
whatever-he-is...

896
01:15:14,192 --> 01:15:15,819
...into an international hero.

897
01:15:16,494 --> 01:15:20,726
"One lone man, marching dusty roads,
armed only with honesty...

898
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:24,333
...and a bamboo staff, doing battle
with the British Empire."

899
01:15:24,535 --> 01:15:27,800
At home, children are
writing essays about him.

900
01:15:29,741 --> 01:15:32,039
What do they want?

901
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:33,670
Gareth!

902
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:39,081
There's a rebate on rents paid.

903
01:15:39,617 --> 01:15:41,812
They're to be free to grow crops
of their own choice.

904
01:15:42,253 --> 01:15:45,245
And a commission, part Indian,
to hear grievances.

905
01:15:50,094 --> 01:15:53,086
That would satisfy him?

906
01:15:53,364 --> 01:15:54,854
And His Majesty's government.

907
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,533
It only needs your signature
for the landlords.

908
01:16:07,445 --> 01:16:09,675
It'll be worth it to see
the back of him.

909
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:14,579
Thank you, sir.

910
01:16:15,953 --> 01:16:17,944
We're too damned liberal.

911
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,145
Perhaps.

912
01:16:19,891 --> 01:16:23,987
At least this has made the government
see some sense about what men...

913
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:26,663
...like Mr. Gandhi should be
allowed and denied.

914
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,841
Where is Mr. Gandhi?

915
01:16:45,316 --> 01:16:47,648
He said he preferred to walk, sir.

916
01:16:47,852 --> 01:16:51,288
I followed him most of the way.
He's just turned the corner.

917
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:54,320
He came third class.

918
01:16:55,126 --> 01:16:57,390
God, give me patience.

919
01:17:02,633 --> 01:17:04,601
My house is honored.

920
01:17:04,802 --> 01:17:06,235
The honor is ours.

921
01:17:06,437 --> 01:17:09,372
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.

922
01:17:09,574 --> 01:17:10,871
His interest is in flowers.

923
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:13,873
I told him he could wander
your garden while we talked.

924
01:17:14,078 --> 01:17:17,104
I'll send for my gardener.
You'll have plenty to discuss.

925
01:17:17,315 --> 01:17:18,577
Thank you.

926
01:17:22,954 --> 01:17:25,422
Gentleman, the hero of Champaran.

927
01:17:25,623 --> 01:17:28,057
Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

928
01:17:28,259 --> 01:17:30,454
Mr. Patel you know.

929
01:17:30,661 --> 01:17:33,459
Maulana Azad, my colleague
and a fellow Muslim...

930
01:17:33,664 --> 01:17:36,497
...and just recently
released from prison.

931
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:37,823
<i>Adab.</i>

932
01:17:38,035 --> 01:17:39,366
Mr. Kripalani.

933
01:17:40,571 --> 01:17:42,368
And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.

934
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:47,041
I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

935
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:48,473
Please sit down.

936
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:49,509
Do sit down.

937
01:17:49,714 --> 01:17:54,208
Gentlemen, I've asked you to come
here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...

938
01:17:54,418 --> 01:17:56,978
...because I've had the chance
to see the legislation.

939
01:17:57,188 --> 01:17:59,656
And it is exactly as was rumored.

940
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:03,384
Arrest without warrant,
and automatic imprisonment...

941
01:18:03,594 --> 01:18:06,154
...for possession of materials
considered seditious.

942
01:18:06,364 --> 01:18:09,959
And your writings
are specifically listed.

943
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:12,101
So much for helping them
in the Great War.

944
01:18:12,436 --> 01:18:16,099
There is only one answer:
Direct action on a scale...

945
01:18:16,307 --> 01:18:17,774
...they can never handle.

946
01:18:19,043 --> 01:18:20,567
I don't think so.

947
01:18:20,945 --> 01:18:24,403
Terrorism would only justify
their repression.

948
01:18:25,316 --> 01:18:27,648
And what kind of leaders
would it throw up?

949
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,987
Are they men that we would want
at the head of our country?

950
01:18:32,256 --> 01:18:35,248
I too have read
Mr. Gandhi's writings...

951
01:18:35,459 --> 01:18:39,088
...but I'd rather be ruled by an
Indian terrorist than an English one.

952
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:41,993
And I don't intend to submit
to that kind of law.

953
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:44,099
I must say, it seems to me...

954
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:48,705
...that it's gone beyond remedies
like passive resistance.

955
01:18:49,907 --> 01:18:51,306
If I may...

956
01:18:51,509 --> 01:18:54,842
...l, for one, have never
advocated passive anything.

957
01:18:57,582 --> 01:18:58,446
I'm with Mr. Jinnah.

958
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:01,015
We must never submit to such laws...

959
01:19:01,419 --> 01:19:02,351
...ever.

960
01:19:03,754 --> 01:19:08,157
And I think our resistance must be
active and provocative.

961
01:19:11,128 --> 01:19:12,095
May I?

962
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:17,924
I want to embarrass all those
who wish to treat us as slaves.

963
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:20,837
Thank you.

964
01:19:24,809 --> 01:19:25,798
All of them.

965
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:29,211
- Forgive my stupid illustration.
- Allow me.

966
01:19:29,413 --> 01:19:31,108
No, please.

967
01:19:31,315 --> 01:19:33,681
But I want to change their minds...

968
01:19:33,884 --> 01:19:37,149
...not kill them
for weaknesses we all possess.

969
01:19:39,924 --> 01:19:42,324
And what resistance would you offer?

970
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:46,723
The law is due
to take effect from April 6.

971
01:19:47,131 --> 01:19:48,894
I want to call upon the nation...

972
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:52,228
...to make that a day of
prayer and fasting.

973
01:19:53,104 --> 01:19:54,264
A general strike?

974
01:19:55,606 --> 01:19:58,200
I mean a day of prayer and fasting.

975
01:19:58,409 --> 01:20:02,038
Of course, no work could be done.
No buses.

976
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,279
No trains.

977
01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:05,915
No factories.

978
01:20:06,117 --> 01:20:07,414
No administration.

979
01:20:08,919 --> 01:20:10,716
The country would stop.

980
01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:14,717
My God, it would terrify them!

981
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:17,753
350 million people at prayer?

982
01:20:18,429 --> 01:20:21,398
Even the English newspapers
would have to report that...

983
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:23,233
...and explain why.

984
01:20:23,467 --> 01:20:26,027
- But could we get people to do it?
- Why not?

985
01:20:26,804 --> 01:20:29,500
Champaran stirred the whole country.

986
01:20:30,741 --> 01:20:32,003
Thank you.

987
01:20:32,843 --> 01:20:35,038
They're calling you "Mahatma."

988
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:36,807
"Great Soul."

989
01:20:38,182 --> 01:20:42,118
Fortunately, such news comes
very slowly to where I live.

990
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:47,656
I think if we all worked
to publicize it...

991
01:20:47,858 --> 01:20:48,950
...all of Congress...

992
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,289
...every avenue we know...

993
01:20:51,696 --> 01:20:55,894
I could get articles printed in most
of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.

994
01:21:06,677 --> 01:21:10,113
Only civilians will visit.
Don't you think so, Your Highness?

995
01:21:10,314 --> 01:21:12,839
Of course, the army will
always be loyal.

996
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:15,917
I'll have you know,
we've got 500 troops.

997
01:21:20,357 --> 01:21:23,053
Damn hungry by morning.
I'll tell you that.

998
01:21:28,232 --> 01:21:29,961
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

999
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:31,156
Mr. Kinnoch.

1000
01:21:32,236 --> 01:21:34,170
Sir, I'm afraid it's confirmed.

1001
01:21:35,272 --> 01:21:36,603
Nothing's working, sir.

1002
01:21:36,807 --> 01:21:39,537
The buses, the train, the markets.

1003
01:21:39,877 --> 01:21:42,573
There's not even any ordinary
civilian staff here, sir.

1004
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,112
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

1005
01:21:45,649 --> 01:21:48,982
Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.
It's total.

1006
01:21:49,353 --> 01:21:51,218
The army had to take over
the telegraph...

1007
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:55,220
...or we'd be cut off from the world.

1008
01:22:00,998 --> 01:22:02,590
I can't believe it.

1009
01:22:02,867 --> 01:22:05,597
He's going to sell his own paper
tomorrow in Bombay, sir.

1010
01:22:05,803 --> 01:22:08,465
They've called for a parade
on Victoria Road.

1011
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:10,872
Arrest him.

1012
01:22:18,215 --> 01:22:20,479
He's to go to the visitors' room.

1013
01:22:38,869 --> 01:22:39,893
Bapu.

1014
01:22:41,305 --> 01:22:42,567
You too?

1015
01:22:44,141 --> 01:22:46,632
It seems less formal than Mahatma.

1016
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:58,844
Since your arrest,
the riots have hardly stopped.

1017
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:01,924
Not big, but they keep breaking out.

1018
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:03,684
I run to stop them.

1019
01:23:04,295 --> 01:23:08,322
And Patel and Kripalani,
they're never at rest.

1020
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:13,103
But some English civilians
have been killed.

1021
01:23:16,273 --> 01:23:19,174
And the army is attacking
crowds with clubs.

1022
01:23:21,212 --> 01:23:22,839
Sometimes worse.

1023
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:30,310
Maybe I'm wrong.

1024
01:23:31,388 --> 01:23:33,549
Maybe we're not ready yet.

1025
01:23:34,892 --> 01:23:37,383
In South Africa,
our numbers were small.

1026
01:23:42,633 --> 01:23:46,069
The government's afraid.
They don't know what to do.

1027
01:23:46,503 --> 01:23:49,267
They're more afraid
of terrorism than of you.

1028
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,970
The Viceroy has agreed to your release,
if you will speak for nonviolence.

1029
01:23:57,114 --> 01:23:59,674
I've never spoken for anything else.

1030
01:24:25,509 --> 01:24:26,908
England...

1031
01:24:27,244 --> 01:24:28,905
...is so powerful.

1032
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,008
Its army...

1033
01:24:31,215 --> 01:24:32,443
...and its navy...

1034
01:24:33,284 --> 01:24:35,184
...all its modern weapons...

1035
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,450
But when a great power like that...

1036
01:24:39,356 --> 01:24:41,449
...strikes defenseless people...

1037
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:45,157
...it shows its brutality...

1038
01:24:45,362 --> 01:24:46,454
...its own weakness.

1039
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:49,599
Especially when those people
do not strike back.

1040
01:25:18,495 --> 01:25:20,895
Fighting back will not work.

1041
01:25:21,098 --> 01:25:23,191
And that is why the Mahatma...

1042
01:25:24,068 --> 01:25:27,003
...begs us to take
the course of nonviolence.

1043
01:25:58,102 --> 01:25:59,535
Back away!

1044
01:26:10,614 --> 01:26:12,206
But if we riot...

1045
01:26:12,783 --> 01:26:14,375
...if we fight back...

1046
01:26:16,186 --> 01:26:17,847
...we become the vandals...

1047
01:26:18,055 --> 01:26:19,420
...and they become the law.

1048
01:26:20,524 --> 01:26:24,585
If we bear their blows,
they are the vandals.

1049
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,694
God and His law are on our...

1050
01:26:58,996 --> 01:27:01,624
Front rank, kneel in position!

1051
01:27:04,902 --> 01:27:05,766
We...

1052
01:27:06,837 --> 01:27:08,532
...must have the courage...

1053
01:27:09,573 --> 01:27:11,473
...to take their anger.

1054
01:27:24,688 --> 01:27:26,679
Should we issue a warning, sir?

1055
01:27:28,892 --> 01:27:30,985
They've had their warning:

1056
01:27:31,495 --> 01:27:33,122
No meetings.

1057
01:27:37,301 --> 01:27:38,165
Fire!

1058
01:28:11,135 --> 01:28:13,035
Take your time!

1059
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:36,016
Corporal!

1060
01:28:36,426 --> 01:28:37,791
To your left.

1061
01:29:26,443 --> 01:29:27,774
General Dyer...

1062
01:29:28,845 --> 01:29:31,712
...is it correct that you ordered
your troops to fire...

1063
01:29:31,915 --> 01:29:34,247
...at the thickest part of the crowd?

1064
01:29:34,818 --> 01:29:36,342
That is so.

1065
01:29:41,491 --> 01:29:44,551
1,516 casualties with...

1066
01:29:46,129 --> 01:29:48,689
...1,650 bullets.

1067
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:51,764
My intention was to inflict a lesson...

1068
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:55,029
...that would have an impact
throughout all India.

1069
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:01,472
General...

1070
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:06,916
...had you been able to
take in the armored car...

1071
01:30:07,517 --> 01:30:10,042
...would you have opened fire
with the machine gun?

1072
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:16,187
I think, probably, yes.

1073
01:30:19,396 --> 01:30:23,332
General, did you realize there were
children and women in the crowd?

1074
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:26,367
I did.

1075
01:30:27,371 --> 01:30:30,169
But that was irrelevant
to the point you were making?

1076
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,930
That is correct.

1077
01:30:38,649 --> 01:30:42,050
Could I ask you what provision
you made for the wounded?

1078
01:30:46,423 --> 01:30:48,891
I was ready to help any who applied.

1079
01:30:51,194 --> 01:30:54,027
General, how does a child...

1080
01:30:54,564 --> 01:30:57,032
...shot with a.303 Lee-Enfield...

1081
01:30:57,968 --> 01:30:59,902
...apply for help?

1082
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:49,562
<i>Forgive me, gentlemen,
but you must understand...</i>

1083
01:34:50,133 --> 01:34:54,627
...that His Majesty's government
and the British people repudiate...

1084
01:34:55,138 --> 01:34:58,733
...both the massacre and
the philosophy that prompted it.

1085
01:34:59,809 --> 01:35:00,798
Now...

1086
01:35:01,478 --> 01:35:03,571
...what I would like to do...

1087
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:07,381
...is to come to some compromise...

1088
01:35:07,584 --> 01:35:08,414
...over the new...

1089
01:35:08,618 --> 01:35:10,950
If you will excuse me,
Your Excellency...

1090
01:35:11,154 --> 01:35:14,385
...it is our view that matters
have gone beyond legislation.

1091
01:35:14,925 --> 01:35:16,688
We think it is time you recognized...

1092
01:35:16,893 --> 01:35:19,691
...that you are masters
in someone else's home.

1093
01:35:21,965 --> 01:35:24,456
Despite the best intentions
of the best of you...

1094
01:35:24,668 --> 01:35:28,570
...you must, in the nature of things,
humiliate us to control us.

1095
01:35:29,573 --> 01:35:33,168
General Dyer is but an extreme
example of the principle.

1096
01:35:34,578 --> 01:35:36,273
It is time you left.

1097
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:42,848
With respect, Mr. Gandhi...

1098
01:35:43,153 --> 01:35:45,212
...without British administration...

1099
01:35:45,422 --> 01:35:47,481
...this country would be
reduced to chaos.

1100
01:35:47,824 --> 01:35:49,086
Mr. Kinnoch...

1101
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:53,456
...I beg you to accept
that there is no people...

1102
01:35:53,663 --> 01:35:56,131
...who would not prefer
their own bad government...

1103
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,699
...to the good government
of an alien power.

1104
01:35:58,902 --> 01:36:01,632
My dear sir, India is British.

1105
01:36:01,838 --> 01:36:04,170
We're hardly an alien power.

1106
01:36:11,648 --> 01:36:15,175
Even if His Majesty could waive
all other considerations...

1107
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,847
...he has a duty to the millions
of his Muslim subjects...

1108
01:36:21,057 --> 01:36:23,184
...who are a minority in this realm.

1109
01:36:23,493 --> 01:36:26,860
And experience suggests
that his troops...

1110
01:36:27,063 --> 01:36:30,658
...and his administration
are essential...

1111
01:36:30,934 --> 01:36:33,494
...in order to secure the peace.

1112
01:36:34,404 --> 01:36:37,635
All nations contain
religious minorities.

1113
01:36:37,941 --> 01:36:40,967
Like other countries,
ours will have its problems.

1114
01:36:41,177 --> 01:36:42,940
But they will be ours...

1115
01:36:43,346 --> 01:36:44,506
...not yours.

1116
01:36:45,815 --> 01:36:47,749
How do you propose
to make them yours?

1117
01:36:48,818 --> 01:36:51,309
You don't think we're just
going to walk out of India?

1118
01:36:52,055 --> 01:36:52,885
Yes.

1119
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:54,988
In the end...

1120
01:36:55,191 --> 01:36:56,624
...you will walk out...

1121
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,721
...because 100,000 Englishmen
simply cannot control...

1122
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:03,626
...350 million Indians,
if those Indians refuse...

1123
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,425
...to cooperate.

1124
01:37:05,769 --> 01:37:08,203
And that is what
we intend to achieve.

1125
01:37:08,505 --> 01:37:12,737
Peaceful, nonviolent
noncooperation...

1126
01:37:13,943 --> 01:37:16,673
...till you yourself
see the wisdom of leaving...

1127
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,811
...Your Excellency.

1128
01:37:21,818 --> 01:37:24,651
I said to him, "You don't
expect us just to walk out?"

1129
01:37:24,854 --> 01:37:26,685
And he said, "Yes."

1130
01:37:27,123 --> 01:37:29,683
What an extraordinary little man,
isn't he?

1131
01:37:29,893 --> 01:37:32,191
"Nonviolence, noncooperation."

1132
01:37:32,395 --> 01:37:35,523
For a moment, I was afraid they were
actually going to do something.

1133
01:37:35,732 --> 01:37:40,169
Yes, but I think it would be wise
to be very cautious for a time.

1134
01:37:40,603 --> 01:37:43,197
The Antiterrorist Act
will remain on the statutes.

1135
01:37:43,406 --> 01:37:46,864
But on no account
is Gandhi to be arrested.

1136
01:37:47,377 --> 01:37:49,607
Whatever mischief he causes...

1137
01:37:49,813 --> 01:37:53,010
...I have no intention
of making a martyr of him.

1138
01:37:57,087 --> 01:37:59,783
But now something worse is happening.

1139
01:37:59,989 --> 01:38:02,253
When Gandhiji and I were growing up...

1140
01:38:02,892 --> 01:38:05,759
...women wove their own cloth.

1141
01:38:06,796 --> 01:38:09,731
But now there are millions
who have no work...

1142
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:14,734
...because those who can
buy all they need from England.

1143
01:38:16,539 --> 01:38:18,837
I say with Gandhiji:

1144
01:38:19,542 --> 01:38:22,602
There is no beauty
in the finest cloth...

1145
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:26,009
...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.

1146
01:38:57,981 --> 01:38:59,778
My message to you...

1147
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:04,486
...is the message I have given
to your brothers everywhere.

1148
01:39:05,455 --> 01:39:07,753
To gain independence...

1149
01:39:08,224 --> 01:39:10,124
...we must prove worthy of it.

1150
01:39:11,661 --> 01:39:16,121
There must be
Hindu-Muslim unity always.

1151
01:39:21,971 --> 01:39:22,801
Second...

1152
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:27,567
...no Indian must be treated
as the English treat us.

1153
01:39:27,844 --> 01:39:30,210
We must remove untouchability...

1154
01:39:30,413 --> 01:39:33,246
...from our hearts and from our lives.

1155
01:39:38,888 --> 01:39:40,150
Third...

1156
01:39:40,924 --> 01:39:43,154
...we must defy the British.

1157
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:04,774
Not with violence
that will inflame their will...

1158
01:40:06,015 --> 01:40:09,451
...but with a firmness that will
open their eyes.

1159
01:40:10,053 --> 01:40:12,749
English factories make the cloth...

1160
01:40:13,256 --> 01:40:15,417
...that makes our poverty.

1161
01:40:16,226 --> 01:40:19,218
All those who wish to
make the English see...

1162
01:40:19,796 --> 01:40:24,233
...bring me the cloth from Manchester
and Leeds that you wear today...

1163
01:40:24,701 --> 01:40:27,499
...and we will light a fire
that will be seen in Delhi...

1164
01:40:28,838 --> 01:40:30,237
...and in London.

1165
01:40:30,773 --> 01:40:32,001
And if...

1166
01:40:32,709 --> 01:40:34,142
...like me...

1167
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:38,038
...you are left with only
one piece of homespun...

1168
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:42,884
...wear it with dignity.

1169
01:41:26,429 --> 01:41:28,397
Thank you very much.

1170
01:41:29,098 --> 01:41:31,157
No, thank you, I can manage.

1171
01:41:32,835 --> 01:41:34,700
Don't destroy my good intentions.

1172
01:41:34,904 --> 01:41:37,134
I'm already feeling guilty
about traveling second class.

1173
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:39,069
You've earned a few indulgences.

1174
01:41:39,275 --> 01:41:42,039
Perhaps, but Maulana's made
of sterner stuff.

1175
01:41:42,245 --> 01:41:43,837
Our trains met in Bombay.

1176
01:41:44,047 --> 01:41:47,175
And there he is, back there
in that lot. The model disciple.

1177
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,274
There's another passenger.

1178
01:41:49,652 --> 01:41:53,383
A Miss Slade from London. She's
been writing to Gandhiji for years.

1179
01:41:53,589 --> 01:41:56,023
She's the daughter
of an English admiral.

1180
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,725
What do you think the daughter
of an English admiral...

1181
01:41:59,929 --> 01:42:01,521
...proposes to do in our ashram?

1182
01:42:01,798 --> 01:42:02,628
Sink us?

1183
01:42:02,832 --> 01:42:04,857
From the looks of the luggage, yes.

1184
01:42:05,068 --> 01:42:06,763
She wants to make her home with us.

1185
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,631
And Gandhiji has agreed.

1186
01:42:08,838 --> 01:42:10,203
Miss Slade!

1187
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:12,832
You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.

1188
01:42:13,676 --> 01:42:16,236
And you would be Miss Slade?

1189
01:42:16,612 --> 01:42:19,103
I prefer the name
Gandhiji has given me:

1190
01:42:19,315 --> 01:42:20,577
Mirabehn.

1191
01:42:26,522 --> 01:42:28,217
Don't pull it so fast.

1192
01:42:28,424 --> 01:42:30,187
You'll break it again.

1193
01:42:37,367 --> 01:42:38,595
Leave it.

1194
01:42:40,837 --> 01:42:42,896
God gave you ten thumbs.

1195
01:42:43,206 --> 01:42:44,298
Eleven.

1196
01:42:48,611 --> 01:42:49,942
Sardar!

1197
01:42:56,386 --> 01:42:57,683
Mirabehn!

1198
01:43:04,627 --> 01:43:06,390
Come, come.

1199
01:43:07,964 --> 01:43:09,955
You will be my daughter.

1200
01:43:12,201 --> 01:43:13,293
But then...

1201
01:43:13,836 --> 01:43:16,202
...some rioting broke out...

1202
01:43:16,406 --> 01:43:19,204
...between Hindus and Muslims.

1203
01:43:19,876 --> 01:43:22,106
Violent, terrible.

1204
01:43:23,946 --> 01:43:25,914
Whether it was provoked...

1205
01:43:26,416 --> 01:43:27,678
...I don't know.

1206
01:43:28,885 --> 01:43:32,912
But it gave them an excuse to impose
martial law throughout Bengal.

1207
01:43:34,557 --> 01:43:37,082
Some of the things
the military have done...

1208
01:43:37,493 --> 01:43:39,552
Is the campaign weakening?

1209
01:43:39,929 --> 01:43:42,921
The marches and protests are bigger,
if anything.

1210
01:43:43,132 --> 01:43:45,032
But with the censorship here...

1211
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,201
...they know more in England...

1212
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:49,032
...than we do.

1213
01:43:49,839 --> 01:43:50,669
It saps the courage...

1214
01:43:50,873 --> 01:43:53,205
...to think you may be
suffering alone.

1215
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:55,477
They are not alone.

1216
01:43:56,112 --> 01:44:00,310
And martial law only shows
how desperate the British are.

1217
01:44:04,654 --> 01:44:06,554
Is that homespun?

1218
01:44:08,224 --> 01:44:10,351
I sent for it from here.

1219
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,018
I dyed it myself.

1220
01:44:16,332 --> 01:44:18,596
What do the workers in England
make of what we're doing?

1221
01:44:18,901 --> 01:44:20,493
It must have produced hardship.

1222
01:44:20,703 --> 01:44:22,068
It has...

1223
01:44:22,338 --> 01:44:24,568
...but you'd be surprised.
They really do understand.

1224
01:44:25,374 --> 01:44:26,398
Good.

1225
01:44:29,645 --> 01:44:32,011
Ba will have to teach you
to spin too.

1226
01:44:32,215 --> 01:44:34,274
- I'd rather march.
- First, spin!

1227
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:38,047
Let the others march for a time.

1228
01:44:39,055 --> 01:44:41,683
I'll teach you all our foolishness.

1229
01:44:41,891 --> 01:44:43,825
And you must teach me yours.

1230
01:44:52,201 --> 01:44:56,035
We burn British cloth!
We burn British cloth!

1231
01:45:02,879 --> 01:45:06,838
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1232
01:45:20,763 --> 01:45:24,494
British rule must go!
British rule must go!

1233
01:45:31,007 --> 01:45:33,271
I'll stuff it down your damn throat!

1234
01:45:35,344 --> 01:45:36,743
Help us!

1235
01:45:37,146 --> 01:45:39,376
Leave us alone!
We're not harming you.

1236
01:45:39,949 --> 01:45:41,678
Go on your way!

1237
01:45:42,685 --> 01:45:43,652
Come back!

1238
01:45:46,122 --> 01:45:47,316
Help us!

1239
01:47:24,086 --> 01:47:26,554
That's one bit of news
they haven't censored.

1240
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:32,457
Now it's all over the world.

1241
01:47:32,662 --> 01:47:35,392
India's nonviolence.

1242
01:47:37,533 --> 01:47:39,125
What can we do?

1243
01:47:39,735 --> 01:47:41,498
We must end the campaign.

1244
01:47:44,874 --> 01:47:48,401
After what they did at the massacre?
It's only an eye for an eye.

1245
01:47:48,744 --> 01:47:53,204
An eye for an eye only ends up
making the whole world blind.

1246
01:47:53,683 --> 01:47:56,208
Do you know the sacrifices
people have made?

1247
01:47:56,419 --> 01:47:58,717
We would never get
the same commitment again, ever.

1248
01:47:58,921 --> 01:48:01,856
The whole of India is on the move!

1249
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:04,356
Yes, but in what direction?

1250
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,553
If we obtain our freedom by murder and
bloodshed, I want no part of it.

1251
01:48:12,201 --> 01:48:14,863
You are the father of the nation.

1252
01:48:15,137 --> 01:48:18,231
Today, I see no ground in that
for anything but shame.

1253
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:23,935
It was one incident.

1254
01:48:24,246 --> 01:48:27,181
Tell that to the families of
the policemen who died.

1255
01:48:33,289 --> 01:48:36,349
The whole nation is marching.

1256
01:48:36,692 --> 01:48:39,855
They wouldn't stop
even if we asked them to.

1257
01:48:42,331 --> 01:48:43,764
I will ask.

1258
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:49,194
And I will fast as a penance
for my part in arousing such emotions.

1259
01:48:49,405 --> 01:48:52,067
And I will not stop until they stop.

1260
01:48:53,776 --> 01:48:54,708
But...

1261
01:48:55,378 --> 01:48:58,506
God! You can be sure
the British won't censor that.

1262
01:48:58,714 --> 01:49:00,841
They'll put it on every street corner.

1263
01:49:03,452 --> 01:49:05,977
People are aroused.

1264
01:49:06,188 --> 01:49:07,985
They won't stop!

1265
01:49:09,658 --> 01:49:12,354
If I die, perhaps they will stop.

1266
01:49:52,034 --> 01:49:54,832
I must get ready for morning prayers.

1267
01:49:55,037 --> 01:49:56,766
Mirabehn is here.

1268
01:50:43,719 --> 01:50:45,687
I've brought your drinking water.

1269
01:50:58,567 --> 01:51:00,501
There's a little lemon juice in it.

1270
01:51:00,703 --> 01:51:01,897
That's all.

1271
01:51:14,783 --> 01:51:17,581
Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru.

1272
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,185
There was a telegram.

1273
01:51:20,389 --> 01:51:23,483
Almost everywhere, it has stopped.

1274
01:51:23,692 --> 01:51:25,717
When it is everywhere...

1275
01:51:27,162 --> 01:51:29,824
...then my prayers will be answered.

1276
01:51:33,769 --> 01:51:35,737
Do you find me stubborn?

1277
01:51:36,739 --> 01:51:38,036
I don't know.

1278
01:51:38,941 --> 01:51:41,136
I know that you are right.

1279
01:51:41,644 --> 01:51:44,078
I don't know that this is right.

1280
01:51:46,682 --> 01:51:48,377
May I turn you?

1281
01:52:01,997 --> 01:52:04,192
When I despair...

1282
01:52:04,667 --> 01:52:08,194
...I remember that
all through history...

1283
01:52:09,104 --> 01:52:13,404
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

1284
01:52:15,344 --> 01:52:18,142
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

1285
01:52:18,347 --> 01:52:22,477
...and, for a time,
they can seem invincible.

1286
01:52:22,685 --> 01:52:25,848
But in the end, they always fall.

1287
01:52:27,656 --> 01:52:28,918
Think of it.

1288
01:52:30,693 --> 01:52:32,183
Always.

1289
01:52:34,129 --> 01:52:37,621
Whenever you are in doubt that
that is God's way...

1290
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:40,802
...the way the world is meant to be...

1291
01:52:41,003 --> 01:52:42,493
...think of that...

1292
01:52:44,139 --> 01:52:47,108
...and then try to do it His way.

1293
01:52:50,412 --> 01:52:54,644
And now, could I have
another feast of lemon juice?

1294
01:52:59,021 --> 01:52:59,885
Panditji!

1295
01:53:13,369 --> 01:53:14,233
Jinnah...

1296
01:53:15,204 --> 01:53:16,262
...Patel...

1297
01:53:16,839 --> 01:53:21,105
...all of congress has called
for the end of noncooperation.

1298
01:53:21,343 --> 01:53:24,870
There's not been one demonstration.

1299
01:53:25,981 --> 01:53:30,441
All over India, people are praying
that you will end the fast.

1300
01:53:31,186 --> 01:53:32,710
They're walking in the streets...

1301
01:53:32,921 --> 01:53:35,446
...offering garlands to the police...

1302
01:53:37,793 --> 01:53:39,192
...and British soldiers.

1303
01:53:42,131 --> 01:53:44,224
Perhaps I have overdone it.

1304
01:54:05,521 --> 01:54:07,546
Good morning, Bapu.

1305
01:54:07,756 --> 01:54:09,690
Don't let him go.

1306
01:54:09,892 --> 01:54:11,450
If he bumps me, I'm done for.

1307
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:13,992
Don't worry, I won't let him go.

1308
01:54:42,691 --> 01:54:44,420
I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...

1309
01:54:44,626 --> 01:54:46,218
...but you're under arrest.

1310
01:54:46,495 --> 01:54:47,962
On what charge?

1311
01:54:48,163 --> 01:54:48,993
Sedition.

1312
01:54:50,332 --> 01:54:52,266
You can't be serious.

1313
01:54:52,568 --> 01:54:54,297
This man has just stopped
a revolution.

1314
01:54:54,503 --> 01:54:55,765
That's as may be.

1315
01:54:55,971 --> 01:54:57,905
I only know what
I am charged to perform.

1316
01:54:58,273 --> 01:54:59,638
I don't believe it!

1317
01:54:59,842 --> 01:55:01,434
The British can't be that stupid.

1318
01:55:03,078 --> 01:55:04,010
Help me, please.

1319
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:07,778
Mira, you must look after Ba.

1320
01:55:12,454 --> 01:55:16,720
If there is one protest, one riot,
a disgrace of any kind...

1321
01:55:16,925 --> 01:55:18,358
...I will fast again.

1322
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,549
Herman.

1323
01:55:20,162 --> 01:55:22,460
I have been on many trips.

1324
01:55:23,031 --> 01:55:23,895
Monda.

1325
01:55:24,867 --> 01:55:26,926
This is just another trip.

1326
01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:29,466
I am at your command.

1327
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:38,473
I know we are not ready
for my kind of independence.

1328
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:41,843
If I'm sent to jail,
perhaps that is the best protest...

1329
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:44,314
...our country can make at this time.

1330
01:55:45,354 --> 01:55:50,121
And, if it helps India, I've never
refused His Majesty's hospitality.

1331
01:55:58,333 --> 01:56:00,631
Call the prisoner to the bar.

1332
01:56:46,548 --> 01:56:49,449
"Noncooperation has one aim:

1333
01:56:49,651 --> 01:56:51,846
The overthrow of the government.

1334
01:56:52,054 --> 01:56:54,522
Sedition must become our creed.

1335
01:56:55,023 --> 01:56:57,082
We must give no quarter...

1336
01:56:57,326 --> 01:56:59,726
...nor can we expect any."

1337
01:57:00,195 --> 01:57:02,629
- Do you deny writing it?
- Not at all.

1338
01:57:03,498 --> 01:57:05,489
And I will save the court's time...

1339
01:57:05,834 --> 01:57:08,234
...my lord, by stating
under oath that, to this day...

1340
01:57:08,437 --> 01:57:10,837
...I believe noncooperation
with evil is a duty...

1341
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:13,303
...and that British rule
of India is evil.

1342
01:57:14,276 --> 01:57:15,971
The prosecution rests, my lord.

1343
01:57:21,083 --> 01:57:23,643
I presume you are conducting
your own defense.

1344
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:27,684
I have no defense, my lord.
I am guilty as charged.

1345
01:57:28,257 --> 01:57:30,589
And if you truly believe
in your system of law...

1346
01:57:30,792 --> 01:57:35,559
...you must inflict on me
the severest penalty possible.

1347
01:57:46,675 --> 01:57:50,509
It is impossible for me to ignore
that you are in a different category...

1348
01:57:50,712 --> 01:57:53,681
...from any person
I have ever tried...

1349
01:57:54,549 --> 01:57:56,574
...or am likely to try.

1350
01:57:57,019 --> 01:57:59,613
Nevertheless, it is my duty
to sentence you...

1351
01:57:59,821 --> 01:58:03,018
...to six years' imprisonment.

1352
01:58:13,835 --> 01:58:17,862
Lf, however, His Majesty's government
should, at some later date...

1353
01:58:18,573 --> 01:58:21,667
...see fit to reduce the term...

1354
01:58:23,712 --> 01:58:26,772
...no one will be
better pleased than I.

1355
01:58:54,576 --> 01:58:56,942
Yes, I'm sure that's exactly
what they hoped:

1356
01:58:57,145 --> 01:59:00,512
Put him in prison a few years.
With luck, he'd be forgotten.

1357
01:59:01,049 --> 01:59:02,983
Maybe they could even subdue him.

1358
01:59:04,019 --> 01:59:06,112
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.

1359
01:59:06,321 --> 01:59:08,846
And as soon as he got out,
he was back tramping the countryside...

1360
01:59:09,057 --> 01:59:12,493
...preaching nonviolence and
demanding a free India.

1361
01:59:13,962 --> 01:59:16,726
Everyone knows
another showdown's coming.

1362
01:59:18,734 --> 01:59:21,328
How does an American journalist
in Central America...

1363
01:59:21,536 --> 01:59:24,300
...learn that Gandhi was born
in Porbandar anyway?

1364
01:59:24,506 --> 01:59:26,497
I've been aware of him
for a long time.

1365
01:59:26,708 --> 01:59:28,699
He certainly makes good copy.

1366
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:33,574
The other day, Winston Churchill
called him a half-naked Indian fakir.

1367
01:59:35,283 --> 01:59:36,545
I met him once.

1368
01:59:36,752 --> 01:59:38,276
What, you mean Gandhi?

1369
01:59:38,754 --> 01:59:41,052
South Africa, a long time ago.

1370
01:59:41,456 --> 01:59:43,287
I wonder if he'll recognize me.

1371
01:59:43,492 --> 01:59:44,720
What was he like?

1372
01:59:44,926 --> 01:59:47,019
He had a full head of hair then.

1373
01:59:47,562 --> 01:59:50,656
We were a bit like college students,
trying to figure everything out.

1374
01:59:50,866 --> 01:59:53,357
Well, he must have found
some of the answers.

1375
02:00:00,042 --> 02:00:04,001
In every worthy wish of yours,
I shall be your helpmate.

1376
02:00:04,212 --> 02:00:05,645
Helpmate.

1377
02:00:07,315 --> 02:00:11,979
Take the fourth step,
that we may be ever full of joy.

1378
02:00:13,188 --> 02:00:15,713
I will ever live devoted to you...

1379
02:00:15,924 --> 02:00:20,088
...speaking words of love
and praying for your happiness.

1380
02:00:21,830 --> 02:00:24,128
Take the fifth step...

1381
02:00:24,332 --> 02:00:26,232
...the walking around a fire...

1382
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:31,871
...that we may serve the people.

1383
02:00:32,074 --> 02:00:34,872
I will follow close behind you...

1384
02:00:35,077 --> 02:00:37,568
...and help to serve the people.

1385
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:41,272
Take the sixth step...

1386
02:00:42,451 --> 02:00:45,614
...that we may follow
our vows in life.

1387
02:00:46,321 --> 02:00:50,815
I will follow you
in all our vows and duties.

1388
02:00:51,927 --> 02:00:54,088
Take the seventh step...

1389
02:00:56,932 --> 02:00:59,696
...that we may ever
live as friends.

1390
02:01:01,970 --> 02:01:04,438
You are my best friend...

1391
02:01:05,841 --> 02:01:07,672
...my highest guru...

1392
02:01:08,777 --> 02:01:11,075
...and my sovereign lord.

1393
02:01:15,283 --> 02:01:18,411
And then I put a sweetened
wheat cake in her mouth.

1394
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:21,111
And I put a sweetened
wheat cake in his mouth.

1395
02:01:21,323 --> 02:01:23,985
And with that, we were pronounced...

1396
02:01:24,192 --> 02:01:25,853
...man and wife.

1397
02:01:28,029 --> 02:01:30,327
We were both 13.

1398
02:01:42,777 --> 02:01:44,244
It's beautiful.

1399
02:01:45,914 --> 02:01:48,781
Even as a boy, I thought so.

1400
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:52,712
Thank you.

1401
02:01:54,222 --> 02:01:57,316
Trying to keep up with you
is like chasing a jackrabbit.

1402
02:01:59,361 --> 02:02:03,195
You've come because you think
something is going to happen.

1403
02:02:04,666 --> 02:02:05,496
Is it?

1404
02:02:06,168 --> 02:02:07,157
Perhaps.

1405
02:02:08,436 --> 02:02:10,495
I've come here to think about it.

1406
02:02:14,176 --> 02:02:16,041
Do you remember much
of South Africa?

1407
02:02:17,579 --> 02:02:18,739
A great deal.

1408
02:02:21,483 --> 02:02:23,246
I've traveled so far...

1409
02:02:23,919 --> 02:02:25,819
...and thought so much.

1410
02:02:30,392 --> 02:02:31,222
As you can see...

1411
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:34,455
...my city is a sea city.

1412
02:02:35,697 --> 02:02:38,131
Always full of Hindus...

1413
02:02:38,333 --> 02:02:39,857
...Muslims...

1414
02:02:40,068 --> 02:02:42,298
...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.

1415
02:02:44,673 --> 02:02:47,233
My family's sect was the Pranami.

1416
02:02:48,176 --> 02:02:49,507
Hindu, of course.

1417
02:02:49,711 --> 02:02:52,976
But in our temple,
the priest used to read...

1418
02:02:53,181 --> 02:02:55,411
<i>...from the Muslim Koran...</i>

1419
02:02:55,617 --> 02:02:58,484
<i>...and the Hindu Gita,
moving from one to the other...</i>

1420
02:02:58,687 --> 02:03:01,212
...as if it mattered not
which book was read...

1421
02:03:01,423 --> 02:03:03,323
...as long as God was worshiped.

1422
02:03:06,828 --> 02:03:08,261
When I was a boy...

1423
02:03:08,863 --> 02:03:10,990
...I used to sing a song
in the temple.

1424
02:03:14,469 --> 02:03:18,769
<i>A true disciple
Knows another's woes</i>

1425
02:03:19,007 --> 02:03:21,202
<i>As his own</i>

1426
02:03:21,676 --> 02:03:22,904
He bows to all...

1427
02:03:23,111 --> 02:03:25,341
...and despises none.

1428
02:03:26,648 --> 02:03:28,013
Like all other boys...

1429
02:03:28,216 --> 02:03:29,774
...I sang the words...

1430
02:03:30,318 --> 02:03:31,580
...not thinking what they meant...

1431
02:03:31,786 --> 02:03:33,754
...or how they might influence me.

1432
02:03:38,026 --> 02:03:39,994
I've traveled so far.

1433
02:03:41,263 --> 02:03:43,731
And all I've done is come back...

1434
02:03:44,599 --> 02:03:45,998
...home.

1435
02:03:56,244 --> 02:03:57,074
Wait a minute.

1436
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,072
You know what you're going to do,
don't you?

1437
02:04:00,282 --> 02:04:01,874
It would have been uncivil of me...

1438
02:04:02,083 --> 02:04:04,813
...to let you make
such a long trip for nothing.

1439
02:04:06,821 --> 02:04:08,254
- Where are you going?
- Come.

1440
02:04:10,625 --> 02:04:12,957
- Where are we going?
- Back to the ashram.

1441
02:04:13,161 --> 02:04:15,288
Then I'm going to prove
to the new Viceroy...

1442
02:04:15,497 --> 02:04:18,398
...that the King's writ
no longer runs in India.

1443
02:04:18,767 --> 02:04:19,597
Salt?

1444
02:04:19,801 --> 02:04:21,063
Yes, sir.
He's going to march...

1445
02:04:21,269 --> 02:04:23,965
...to the sea and make salt.

1446
02:04:25,874 --> 02:04:27,671
There's a royal monopoly...

1447
02:04:27,876 --> 02:04:29,241
...on the manufacture of salt.

1448
02:04:29,444 --> 02:04:31,309
It's illegal to make it or sell it...

1449
02:04:31,513 --> 02:04:34,277
...without a government license.

1450
02:04:34,482 --> 02:04:36,848
All right, he's breaking the law.

1451
02:04:37,052 --> 02:04:38,349
What will that deprive us of?

1452
02:04:38,553 --> 02:04:40,282
Two rupees of salt tax?

1453
02:04:40,488 --> 02:04:42,149
It's not a serious attack
on the revenue.

1454
02:04:42,357 --> 02:04:45,258
Its primary importance is symbolic.

1455
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:47,690
Don't patronize me, Charles.

1456
02:04:51,866 --> 02:04:55,233
In this climate, nothing lives
without water or salt.

1457
02:04:55,437 --> 02:04:58,167
Our absolute control of it
is a control on the pulse...

1458
02:04:58,373 --> 02:05:00,068
...of India.

1459
02:05:00,275 --> 02:05:04,041
And that's the basis of
this declaration of independence?

1460
02:05:04,279 --> 02:05:05,576
The day he sets off...

1461
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:09,910
...everyone is supposed to
raise the flag of "Free India."

1462
02:05:10,552 --> 02:05:12,213
Then he walks 240 miles...

1463
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:15,389
...to the sea and makes salt.

1464
02:05:19,327 --> 02:05:20,351
I say, ignore it.

1465
02:05:21,796 --> 02:05:24,264
Let them raise their damned flags.

1466
02:05:24,466 --> 02:05:25,558
Let him make his salt.

1467
02:05:26,634 --> 02:05:27,896
It's only symbolic...

1468
02:05:28,103 --> 02:05:29,866
...if we choose to make it so.

1469
02:05:32,073 --> 02:05:33,131
He'll arrive...

1470
02:05:33,341 --> 02:05:37,243
...at the sea on the anniversary
of the Massacre of Amritsar.

1471
02:05:46,187 --> 02:05:47,654
General Edgar is right.

1472
02:05:47,856 --> 02:05:48,880
Ignore it.

1473
02:05:49,090 --> 02:05:50,114
Mr. Gandhi will find...

1474
02:05:50,325 --> 02:05:52,122
...it takes a great deal more than...

1475
02:05:52,327 --> 02:05:56,161
...a pinch of salt to bring down
the British Empire.

1476
02:06:50,285 --> 02:06:53,049
You've done me a great service.

1477
02:06:53,455 --> 02:06:54,683
Not at all, sir.

1478
02:06:54,889 --> 02:06:56,379
It would be uncivil for us...

1479
02:06:56,591 --> 02:06:58,991
...to let you make
such a long trip for nothing.

1480
02:07:13,942 --> 02:07:15,136
We'll go.

1481
02:07:15,343 --> 02:07:19,040
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1482
02:07:41,536 --> 02:07:43,197
Is it over if they arrest you now?

1483
02:07:43,404 --> 02:07:44,871
Not if they arrest me...

1484
02:07:45,073 --> 02:07:47,541
...or 1,000 or 10,000.

1485
02:07:47,742 --> 02:07:51,701
It's not only generals
who know how to plan campaigns.

1486
02:07:52,313 --> 02:07:54,975
What if they don't arrest you?
What if they don't react at all?

1487
02:07:55,183 --> 02:07:56,514
Something for your notebook:

1488
02:07:56,985 --> 02:08:00,284
The function of a civil resister
is to provoke response.

1489
02:08:00,488 --> 02:08:02,319
And we will continue to provoke...

1490
02:08:02,524 --> 02:08:05,891
...until they respond
or they change the law.

1491
02:08:06,094 --> 02:08:09,257
They are not in control.
We are.

1492
02:08:09,731 --> 02:08:12,757
That is the strength
of civil resistance.

1493
02:08:17,505 --> 02:08:18,335
Vince!

1494
02:08:19,774 --> 02:08:23,540
- What did he say?
- He said he's in control.

1495
02:08:45,590 --> 02:08:47,820
Do you intend to walk all the way?

1496
02:08:48,026 --> 02:08:50,290
It's the only way
I can get the story.

1497
02:08:50,495 --> 02:08:52,895
Besides, my name is Walker.

1498
02:08:53,632 --> 02:08:55,293
"My name is Walker."

1499
02:09:50,122 --> 02:09:52,215
My dear Mrs. Naidu!

1500
02:10:47,179 --> 02:10:49,443
Man needs salt...

1501
02:10:49,648 --> 02:10:52,378
...as he needs air and water.

1502
02:10:52,584 --> 02:10:56,611
This salt comes
from the Indian Ocean.

1503
02:10:56,822 --> 02:11:00,087
Let every Indian claim it
as his right.

1504
02:11:02,227 --> 02:11:05,162
<i>And so once more,
the man of nonviolence...</i>

1505
02:11:05,363 --> 02:11:07,957
<i>...has challenged the might
of the British Empire.</i>

1506
02:11:23,982 --> 02:11:25,882
They're making it everywhere, sir.

1507
02:11:26,084 --> 02:11:27,016
Mobs of them...

1508
02:11:27,385 --> 02:11:28,511
...publicly.

1509
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:32,315
The congress leaders are selling it
on the streets of Delhi.

1510
02:11:32,524 --> 02:11:34,048
We're being made fools of, sir...

1511
02:11:34,259 --> 02:11:35,624
...around the world.

1512
02:11:35,827 --> 02:11:38,057
Isn't there any instruction
from London?

1513
02:11:38,263 --> 02:11:39,662
We're required to stop it.

1514
02:11:39,865 --> 02:11:41,765
And stop it we will!

1515
02:11:41,967 --> 02:11:44,435
I don't care if we fill the jails.
Stop it!

1516
02:11:45,337 --> 02:11:46,827
Arrest anyone, any rank...

1517
02:11:47,038 --> 02:11:48,471
...except Gandhi.

1518
02:11:49,307 --> 02:11:51,605
We'll cut the strength
from under him.

1519
02:11:52,711 --> 02:11:56,112
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.

1520
02:12:13,532 --> 02:12:14,464
Jump to it!

1521
02:12:14,666 --> 02:12:16,224
Clear this beach!

1522
02:12:51,570 --> 02:12:52,559
Don't hit back!

1523
02:12:52,771 --> 02:12:53,635
No violence!

1524
02:13:04,382 --> 02:13:07,146
There must be 100,000 under arrest.

1525
02:13:07,352 --> 02:13:09,820
- And it still goes on.
- Who's leading them?

1526
02:13:10,021 --> 02:13:12,114
I don't know.
Nehru, Patel...

1527
02:13:12,324 --> 02:13:14,622
...almost every congress official
is in jail...

1528
02:13:14,826 --> 02:13:16,623
...and their wives
and their children.

1529
02:13:16,828 --> 02:13:18,693
We've even arrested Nehru's mother.

1530
02:13:21,866 --> 02:13:23,959
Has there been any violence?

1531
02:13:24,169 --> 02:13:27,195
In Peshawar,
the deputy police commissioner...

1532
02:13:27,405 --> 02:13:30,499
...lost his head and opened fire
with a machine gun.

1533
02:13:31,576 --> 02:13:33,840
But he's facing a disciplinary court.

1534
02:13:34,746 --> 02:13:36,907
You can't expect things
like that not to happen.

1535
02:13:37,115 --> 02:13:38,309
The question was intended...

1536
02:13:38,516 --> 02:13:41,974
...to discover whether there was
any violence on their side.

1537
02:13:44,589 --> 02:13:45,920
No, sir.

1538
02:13:46,124 --> 02:13:47,455
I'm afraid not.

1539
02:13:48,426 --> 02:13:52,362
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,
it might...

1540
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:58,228
He's addressed this letter
directly to you, has he?

1541
02:13:58,436 --> 02:13:59,664
Yes, sir, he has.

1542
02:13:59,871 --> 02:14:00,963
The usual thing:

1543
02:14:01,172 --> 02:14:03,402
"India's salt belongs to India."

1544
02:14:03,608 --> 02:14:04,734
Then he says flatly...

1545
02:14:04,943 --> 02:14:09,209
...that he will lead a raid tomorrow
on the Dharasana salt works.

1546
02:14:10,515 --> 02:14:12,346
Thank him for his letter...

1547
02:14:12,784 --> 02:14:13,978
...and put him in jail.

1548
02:14:16,488 --> 02:14:17,318
Yes, sir.

1549
02:14:19,891 --> 02:14:21,552
It'll be my pleasure.

1550
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:22,658
And Fields?

1551
02:14:24,229 --> 02:14:26,857
Keep that salt works open.

1552
02:14:27,065 --> 02:14:28,054
Yes, sir.

1553
02:14:33,271 --> 02:14:33,371
I'm sorry, sir.

1554
02:14:33,371 --> 02:14:33,928
I'm sorry, sir.

1555
02:14:35,206 --> 02:14:39,074
My orders are to allow regular staff
only through these gates.

1556
02:14:39,277 --> 02:14:40,767
Very well.

1557
02:14:40,979 --> 02:14:44,039
We will receive them in his name.

1558
02:14:44,249 --> 02:14:49,152
And for his sake,
we will not raise a hand.

1559
02:14:49,354 --> 02:14:52,482
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!

1560
02:14:54,759 --> 02:14:56,784
Long live Gandhiji!

1561
02:15:00,598 --> 02:15:01,860
We are ready!

1562
02:15:09,507 --> 02:15:11,668
I want firmness and discipline.

1563
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:32,854
Take your positions.

1564
02:15:41,573 --> 02:15:42,437
To your mark.

1565
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:44,005
Forward!

1566
02:15:54,652 --> 02:15:56,711
Last night at midnight...

1567
02:15:57,655 --> 02:15:59,213
...they took Gandhiji from us.

1568
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:02,991
They expect us to lose heart...

1569
02:16:03,194 --> 02:16:04,821
...or to fight back.

1570
02:16:05,697 --> 02:16:07,756
We will do neither!

1571
02:16:39,197 --> 02:16:40,596
On your guard!

1572
02:16:57,482 --> 02:16:59,074
No, sir.
The gate is closed!

1573
02:18:18,263 --> 02:18:19,423
<i>"They walked...</i>

1574
02:18:19,998 --> 02:18:22,125
<i>...both Hindu and Muslim alike...</i>

<i>...with heads held high...</i>

1576

1577

<i>...from injury or death.</i>

1578
02:18:29,908 --> 02:18:33,207
It went on and on into the night."

1579
02:18:33,411 --> 02:18:34,400
Stop.

1580

"Women carried the wounded
and broken bodies from the road...

1581

...until they dropped
from exhaustion."

1582
02:18:41,786 --> 02:18:42,718
Stop.

1583
02:18:42,921 --> 02:18:46,379
"But still, it went on and on.

1584
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:52,925
Whatever moral ascendancy
the West held...

1585
02:18:53,131 --> 02:18:55,122
...was lost here today.

1586
02:18:55,867 --> 02:18:57,926
<i>India is free...</i>

1587
02:18:58,136 --> 02:19:02,971
<i>...for she has taken all
that steel and cruelty can give...</i>

1588
02:19:03,174 --> 02:19:07,304
<i>...and she has neither
cringed nor retreated."</i>

1589
02:20:17,782 --> 02:20:18,680
I am aware...

1590
02:20:18,916 --> 02:20:22,682
...that I must have given you
much cause for irritation...

1591
02:20:22,887 --> 02:20:23,911
...Your Excellency.

1592
02:20:24,122 --> 02:20:27,091
I hope it will not stand
between us as men.

1593
02:20:33,665 --> 02:20:36,896
I am instructed
to request your attendance...

1594
02:20:37,101 --> 02:20:39,501
...at an all-government
conference in London...

1595
02:20:40,371 --> 02:20:41,963
...to discuss...

1596
02:20:42,173 --> 02:20:45,267
...the possible independence...

1597
02:20:45,476 --> 02:20:46,966
...of India.

1598
02:20:57,789 --> 02:21:00,189
<i>Only recently released
from prison...</i>

1599

<i>...Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay...</i>

1600
02:21:02,627 --> 02:21:05,357
<i>...on the S.S. Rajputana
to attend...</i>

1601
02:21:05,663 --> 02:21:07,460
<i>...the conference
on Indian independence...</i>

1602

<i>...called by Prime Minister
Ramsay MacDonald.</i>

1603
02:21:13,037 --> 02:21:16,165
<i>Mr. Gandhi, the sole
Indian Congress Party delegate...</i>

1604
02:21:16,374 --> 02:21:19,138
<i>...is staying at Kingsley Hall
in the East End of London...</i>

<i>...like Mr. Lloyd George...</i>

1611
02:21:33,057 --> 02:21:36,288
<i>...and the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Mr. George Bernard Shaw...</i>

1612
02:21:36,494 --> 02:21:38,428
<i>...and Mr. Charlie Chaplin.</i>

1613
02:21:40,832 --> 02:21:43,232
<i>He journeyed last week
from Kingsley Hall...</i>

1614
02:21:43,434 --> 02:21:47,666
<i>...to accept an invitation to tea
from King George and Queen Mary...</i>

1615
02:21:47,872 --> 02:21:51,364
<i>...at Buckingham Palace
before attending the conference.</i>

1616
02:21:51,576 --> 02:21:55,171
And I would emphasize
that I think our first duty...

1617
02:21:55,379 --> 02:21:59,577
...is to recognize
that there is not one India...

1618
02:22:00,351 --> 02:22:01,784
...but several.

1619
02:22:02,487 --> 02:22:04,478
A Hindu India...

1620
02:22:04,689 --> 02:22:06,919
...a Muslim India...

1621
02:22:07,125 --> 02:22:09,719
...and an India of princely states.

1622
02:22:09,927 --> 02:22:12,828
And all these must be respected...

1623
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:14,588
...and cared for.

1624
02:22:14,832 --> 02:22:16,231
Not just one.

1625
02:22:41,425 --> 02:22:43,256
<i>Mr. Gandhi, who has been attending...</i>

1626
02:22:43,461 --> 02:22:46,589
<i>...the London Round Table Conference
on Indian Independence...</i>

1627
02:22:46,798 --> 02:22:49,426
<i>...journeyed north
to visit a cotton mill.</i>

1628
02:22:49,967 --> 02:22:52,401
<i>Although not dressed
for the Lancashire climate...</i>

1629
02:22:52,603 --> 02:22:55,538
<i>...Mr. Gandhi received
a warm welcome from mill workers...</i>

1630
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:57,964
<i>...before heading back south...</i>

1631
02:22:58,176 --> 02:23:00,804
<i>...for a final meeting
with Mr. MacDonald.</i>

1632
02:23:01,279 --> 02:23:06,080
<i>The prime minister said the talks
were both constructive and frank.</i>

1633
02:23:09,187 --> 02:23:11,587
<i>So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.</i>

1634
02:23:11,956 --> 02:23:14,151
<i>And bon voyage!</i>

1635
02:23:16,394 --> 02:23:18,919
<i>So the truth is,
after all your travels...</i>

1636
02:23:19,130 --> 02:23:20,757
<i>...after all your efforts...</i>

1637
02:23:20,965 --> 02:23:24,526
...they've stopped the campaign
and sent you back empty-handed.

1638
02:23:25,269 --> 02:23:28,636
They're only clinging
to old dreams...

1639
02:23:28,840 --> 02:23:31,741
...and trying to split us
in the old way.

1640
02:23:32,343 --> 02:23:34,208
But the will has gone.

1641
02:23:34,478 --> 02:23:37,641
Independence will fall
like a ripe apple.

1642
02:23:37,849 --> 02:23:40,283
The only question is when and how.

1643
02:23:40,585 --> 02:23:42,450
Well, I say, when is now!

1644
02:23:44,689 --> 02:23:47,089
And we will determine how.

1645
02:23:47,291 --> 02:23:48,758
Precisely.

1646
02:23:49,493 --> 02:23:51,427
Bapu, she is limping again.

1647
02:23:51,829 --> 02:23:53,353
It's only a sprain.

1648
02:23:53,764 --> 02:23:57,200
Take her to the river.
We'll make a mud pack for her.

1649
02:23:58,502 --> 02:24:01,130
Go. I won't be a moment.

1650
02:24:04,742 --> 02:24:06,733
They are preparing for war.

1651
02:24:07,545 --> 02:24:08,876
I will not support it.

1652
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:12,914
But I do not intend to take
advantage of their danger.

1653
02:24:13,117 --> 02:24:15,551
That's when you take advantage.

1654
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:18,721
That is just another way
of hitting back.

1655
02:24:19,891 --> 02:24:22,121
We've come a long way together
with the British.

1656
02:24:22,326 --> 02:24:25,295
When they leave, we want to
see them off as friends.

1657
02:24:25,496 --> 02:24:29,956
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there is something I must attend to.

1658
02:24:36,741 --> 02:24:37,969
Mud packs.

1659
02:24:52,423 --> 02:24:54,084
I have been instructed to inquire...

1660
02:24:54,292 --> 02:24:56,157
...as to the subject
of your speech tonight.

1661
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:59,488
The value of goat's milk
in daily diet.

1662
02:25:01,432 --> 02:25:05,163
But you can be sure that
I will also speak against war.

1663
02:25:05,836 --> 02:25:07,463
Sorry, that can't be permitted.

1664
02:25:07,672 --> 02:25:08,661
Corporal!

1665
02:25:13,577 --> 02:25:14,874
It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.

1666
02:25:15,079 --> 02:25:18,606
I have orders to return with you
and your companion to the ashram.

1667
02:25:19,283 --> 02:25:23,014
If you take my husband,
I intend to speak in his place.

1668
02:25:48,546 --> 02:25:50,309
Hold it a second, will you?

1669
02:25:51,949 --> 02:25:55,009
It was the Aga Khan's palace
before they turned it into a prison.

1670
02:25:55,219 --> 02:25:58,211
They're holding Gandhi and a number
of the congress politicians there.

1671
02:25:58,856 --> 02:26:02,622
Pandit Nehru and the others
are up at Ahmednagar Fort.

1672
02:26:04,428 --> 02:26:06,089
Not bad for a prison, eh?

1673
02:26:06,297 --> 02:26:08,788
I guess no place is good
if you're locked in.

1674
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,991
Your timing's pretty lucky.

1675
02:26:11,202 --> 02:26:13,261
They had him cut off from the press.

1676
02:26:13,471 --> 02:26:17,271
But his personal secretary died,
so they let up on restrictions.

1677
02:26:22,413 --> 02:26:25,280
<i>Yes, I have heard of Life magazine.</i>

1678
02:26:25,483 --> 02:26:29,510
I've even heard of
Margaret Bourke-White.

1679
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:33,713
But I don't know why either
should be interested in an old man...

1680
02:26:33,924 --> 02:26:36,358
...sitting alone in prison...

1681
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:40,087
...while the rest of the world
is blowing itself to pieces.

1682
02:26:42,066 --> 02:26:44,591
You're the only man I know
who makes his own clothes.

1683
02:26:46,871 --> 02:26:50,773
But for me, that's not
much of an accomplishment.

1684
02:26:57,548 --> 02:27:00,540
Prison is rather agreeable to me.

1685
02:27:00,751 --> 02:27:04,551
And there is no doubt that
after the war...

1686
02:27:04,755 --> 02:27:06,950
...independence will come.

1687
02:27:07,158 --> 02:27:08,455
My only worry...

1688
02:27:08,659 --> 02:27:11,093
...is what shape it will take.

1689
02:27:11,295 --> 02:27:13,092
- Jinnah has...
- Stop!

1690
02:27:13,564 --> 02:27:17,000
I'm sorry, but...
Could you come forward, please?

1691
02:27:17,701 --> 02:27:19,862
- Come, come.
- Just up to the railing.

1692
02:27:20,071 --> 02:27:21,663
Thank you very much.

1693
02:27:23,974 --> 02:27:25,168
Now, sorry.

1694
02:27:25,609 --> 02:27:27,941
Go on, just as you were.
"What shape it will take..."

1695
02:27:28,145 --> 02:27:29,612
Jinnah has what?

1696
02:27:31,282 --> 02:27:34,945
Jinnah has cooperated with the British.

1697
02:27:35,152 --> 02:27:39,282
It has given him power
and the freedom to speak.

1698
02:27:39,557 --> 02:27:42,151
And he's filled
the Muslims with fears...

1699
02:27:42,359 --> 02:27:44,554
...of what will happen to them...

1700
02:27:44,762 --> 02:27:47,697
...in a country that
is predominantly Hindu.

1701
02:27:48,332 --> 02:27:51,358
And that I find hard to bear...

1702
02:27:51,569 --> 02:27:53,264
...even in prison.

1703
02:28:01,178 --> 02:28:02,941
It's very hard for me to see this...

1704
02:28:03,147 --> 02:28:05,809
...as a solution to
the 20th century's problems.

1705
02:28:06,584 --> 02:28:09,144
I have friends who keep telling me...

1706
02:28:09,353 --> 02:28:13,255
...how much it costs them
to keep me in poverty.

1707
02:28:15,092 --> 02:28:19,688
But I know happiness
does not come with things...

1708
02:28:19,897 --> 02:28:21,626
...even 20th century things.

1709
02:28:21,832 --> 02:28:26,531
It can come from work
and pride in what you do.

1710
02:28:27,471 --> 02:28:29,564
India lives in her villages...

1711
02:28:29,773 --> 02:28:33,607
...and the terrible poverty there
can only be removed...

1712
02:28:33,811 --> 02:28:37,212
...if their local skills
can be revived.

1713
02:28:37,581 --> 02:28:40,573
Poverty is the worst form
of violence.

1714
02:28:41,285 --> 02:28:43,685
And a constructive program
is the only...

1715
02:28:43,888 --> 02:28:47,255
...nonviolent solution
to India's agony.

1716
02:28:47,892 --> 02:28:50,588
It will not necessarily be
progress for India...

1717
02:28:50,794 --> 02:28:52,091
...if she simply...

1718
02:28:52,296 --> 02:28:55,163
...imports the unhappiness
of the West.

1719
02:28:57,668 --> 02:28:59,693
But do you really believe
you could use nonviolence...

1720
02:28:59,904 --> 02:29:01,337
...against someone like Hitler?

1721
02:29:03,274 --> 02:29:06,505
Not without defeats and great pain.

1722
02:29:07,678 --> 02:29:10,374
But are there no defeats in this war?

1723
02:29:11,081 --> 02:29:12,070
No pain?

1724
02:29:13,751 --> 02:29:15,378
What you cannot do...

1725
02:29:15,586 --> 02:29:17,952
...is accept injustice
from Hitler or anyone.

1726
02:29:18,155 --> 02:29:21,556
You must make the injustice visible.

1727
02:29:21,759 --> 02:29:24,057
Be prepared to die
like a soldier to do so.

1728
02:29:28,933 --> 02:29:31,629
Is this what I'm meant
to end up with here?

1729
02:29:33,103 --> 02:29:35,230
No, that's what you get
for distracting me.

1730
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:37,498
What do you expect
when you talk like that?

1731
02:29:37,708 --> 02:29:42,270
I expect you to show
as much patience as I am now.

1732
02:29:43,180 --> 02:29:46,479
Turn slowly and pull it gently.

1733
02:29:51,989 --> 02:29:54,822
And that includes the life of women.

1734
02:29:55,459 --> 02:29:58,223
Bapu has always said...

1735
02:29:58,429 --> 02:30:01,330
...there were two kinds
of slavery in India:

1736
02:30:01,732 --> 02:30:05,463
One for women,
one for the untouchables.

1737
02:30:06,003 --> 02:30:09,439
And he has always fought against both.

1738
02:30:12,109 --> 02:30:15,237
Does it rankle,
being separated in this way?

1739
02:30:18,916 --> 02:30:21,077
In Hindu philosophy...

1740
02:30:21,952 --> 02:30:23,419
...the way to God...

1741
02:30:23,621 --> 02:30:26,351
...is to free yourself
of possessions...

1742
02:30:27,358 --> 02:30:28,825
...and the passions.

1743
02:30:29,727 --> 02:30:34,164
Bapu has always struggled
to find the way to God.

1744
02:30:37,835 --> 02:30:42,033
Do you mean that
he gave up married life?

1745
02:30:44,708 --> 02:30:47,302
Four times he tried...

1746
02:30:48,078 --> 02:30:49,545
...and failed.

1747
02:30:51,315 --> 02:30:53,340
But then he took a solemn vow.

1748
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:57,382
And he's never broken it?

1749
02:31:00,958 --> 02:31:02,118
Not yet.

1750
02:31:19,777 --> 02:31:21,369
I've got permission to move her.

1751
02:31:21,578 --> 02:31:23,136
I'm very sorry, sir.

1752
02:31:23,347 --> 02:31:26,145
She's had a massive thrombosis.
It's a serious heart attack.

1753
02:31:26,350 --> 02:31:28,011
She'll never survive the trip.

1754
02:31:28,218 --> 02:31:31,153
I think it's better if we just
keep her here and hope.

1755
02:32:18,769 --> 02:32:21,533
It's time for my walk.

1756
02:32:23,974 --> 02:32:25,532
I won't be long.

1757
02:34:43,514 --> 02:34:44,344
Guard...

1758
02:34:44,781 --> 02:34:46,840
...present arm!

1759
02:35:02,733 --> 02:35:06,669
We have come to crown victory
with friendship...

1760
02:35:08,705 --> 02:35:12,004
...to assist at the birth of
an independent India...

1761
02:35:12,309 --> 02:35:13,776
...and to welcome her
as an equal member...

1762
02:35:13,977 --> 02:35:16,070
...in the British Commonwealth
of Nations.

1763
02:35:17,814 --> 02:35:20,715
I am here to see that I am
the last British Viceroy...

1764
02:35:20,918 --> 02:35:24,752
...ever to have the honor
of such a reception.

1765
02:35:37,301 --> 02:35:40,099
I am not concerned about
the independence of India.

1766
02:35:40,504 --> 02:35:43,439
I'm concerned about the slavery
of the Muslims.

1767
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:44,698
Please, Mr. Jinnah.

1768
02:35:45,275 --> 02:35:47,835
I won't stand by to see
the mastery of the British...

1769
02:35:48,045 --> 02:35:50,309
...replaced by the
mastery of the Hindus.

1770
02:35:56,853 --> 02:36:00,983
Muslim and Hindu are the right
and left eye of India.

1771
02:36:01,425 --> 02:36:04,223
No one will be master, no one slave.

1772
02:36:04,428 --> 02:36:06,919
The world is not made of
Mahatma Ghandis.

1773
02:36:07,130 --> 02:36:08,825
I'm talking about the real world.

1774
02:36:09,032 --> 02:36:10,659
- How the...
- The real India has...

1775
02:36:10,867 --> 02:36:14,701
...Muslims and Hindus
in every village and every city.

1776
02:36:16,106 --> 02:36:17,573
How do you propose to separate them?

1777
02:36:18,041 --> 02:36:20,976
Where there is a Muslim majority...

1778
02:36:21,345 --> 02:36:23,279
...that will be Pakistan.

1779
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:25,948
The rest is your India.

1780
02:36:26,149 --> 02:36:27,309
My dear Jinnah...

1781
02:36:27,818 --> 02:36:31,845
...the Muslims are in a majority
on two different sides of the country.

1782
02:36:32,055 --> 02:36:36,048
Let us worry about Pakistan.
You worry about India.

1783
02:36:36,259 --> 02:36:37,453
Gentlemen...

1784
02:36:37,661 --> 02:36:39,822
...I think perhaps
we should recommence.

1785
02:36:54,044 --> 02:36:57,810
Death to Jinnah!
Death to Jinnah!

1786
02:37:25,275 --> 02:37:27,436
Thank God, they've stopped.

1787
02:37:30,747 --> 02:37:31,771
Manu, Aba.

1788
02:37:40,323 --> 02:37:41,881
I'm your granduncle...

1789
02:37:42,092 --> 02:37:45,459
...but I can still walk
either of you into the ground.

1790
02:37:45,662 --> 02:37:47,994
And I don't need to be pampered
in this way.

1791
02:37:48,198 --> 02:37:50,666
Finish your quota of spinning.

1792
02:38:35,212 --> 02:38:36,941
Bapu, please don't do it.

1793
02:38:37,147 --> 02:38:39,809
What do you want me not to do?

1794
02:38:40,183 --> 02:38:42,276
Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?

1795
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:46,011
I am a Muslim...

1796
02:38:46,323 --> 02:38:47,415
...and a Hindu...

1797
02:38:47,824 --> 02:38:50,054
...and a Christian and a Jew.

1798
02:38:50,794 --> 02:38:52,261
And so are all of you.

1799
02:38:55,398 --> 02:38:58,196
When you wave those flags
and shout...

1800
02:38:58,535 --> 02:39:01,732
...you send fear into the hearts
of your brothers.

1801
02:39:01,938 --> 02:39:03,929
That is not the India I want.

1802
02:39:04,141 --> 02:39:05,335
Stop it!

1803
02:39:05,575 --> 02:39:08,203
For God's sake, stop it.

1804
02:39:25,929 --> 02:39:27,794
If you've finished your prayers...

1805
02:39:27,998 --> 02:39:29,488
...perhaps we could begin
our business.

1806
02:39:35,038 --> 02:39:38,007
My dear Jinnah...

1807
02:39:38,275 --> 02:39:41,142
...you and I are brothers...

1808
02:39:41,344 --> 02:39:43,778
...born of the same mother India.

1809
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:45,572
If you have fears...

1810
02:39:45,782 --> 02:39:48,012
...I want to put them at rest.

1811
02:39:48,919 --> 02:39:52,047
Begging the understanding
of my friends...

1812
02:39:52,589 --> 02:39:56,184
...I am asking Panditji
to stand down.

1813
02:39:56,660 --> 02:40:00,653
I want you to be
the first prime minister of India...

1814
02:40:00,864 --> 02:40:03,833
...to name your entire cabinet...

1815
02:40:04,034 --> 02:40:07,834
...to make the head of every
government department a Muslim.

1816
02:40:26,356 --> 02:40:28,688
For me and the rest...

1817
02:40:28,892 --> 02:40:31,019
...if that is what you want...

1818
02:40:31,228 --> 02:40:32,923
...we will accept it.

1819
02:40:34,731 --> 02:40:36,858
But out there...

1820
02:40:37,567 --> 02:40:39,364
...already there is rioting...

1821
02:40:39,569 --> 02:40:43,665
...because Hindus fear
you are going to give too much away.

1822
02:40:44,307 --> 02:40:46,366
If you did this...

1823
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:49,442
...no one would control it.

1824
02:40:50,046 --> 02:40:51,240
No one.

1825
02:41:07,330 --> 02:41:09,059
It is your choice.

1826
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:14,364
Do you want an independent India
and an independent Pakistan...

1827
02:41:14,971 --> 02:41:17,496
...or do you want civil war?

1828
02:41:55,278 --> 02:41:57,269
Jinnah! Jinnah!

1829
02:44:30,533 --> 02:44:34,025
What you did in Noakhali, Bapu,
was a miracle.

1830
02:44:34,504 --> 02:44:35,493
Miracle.

1831
02:44:36,439 --> 02:44:38,737
But millions are on the move...

1832
02:44:38,942 --> 02:44:41,206
...and no one can count the dead.

1833
02:44:43,379 --> 02:44:46,473
In Calcutta, it's like civil war.

1834
02:44:49,119 --> 02:44:52,646
The Muslims rose
and there was a bloodbath.

1835
02:44:53,823 --> 02:44:56,087
Now the Hindus are taking revenge.

1836
02:44:57,760 --> 02:44:59,250
If we can't stop it...

1837
02:44:59,462 --> 02:45:02,431
...there'll be no hope
for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

1838
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:06,831
An eye for an eye,
making the whole world blind.

1839
02:45:08,938 --> 02:45:10,633
Aren't there any troops to spare?

1840
02:45:12,208 --> 02:45:13,266
Nothing.

1841
02:45:17,046 --> 02:45:18,343
Nothing.

1842
02:45:22,886 --> 02:45:25,912
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi
can hardly keep the peace now.

1843
02:45:26,122 --> 02:45:30,388
And each fresh bit of news creates
another wave of madness.

1844
02:45:30,593 --> 02:45:32,925
We could cut all news off.

1845
02:45:33,496 --> 02:45:35,225
Bapu, please, where are you going?

1846
02:45:35,665 --> 02:45:37,326
I don't want to hear more.

1847
02:45:38,635 --> 02:45:40,535
We need your help.

1848
02:45:41,004 --> 02:45:43,370
There is nothing I can give.

1849
02:45:46,409 --> 02:45:47,774
Where are you going?

1850
02:45:51,047 --> 02:45:52,275
Calcutta.

1851
02:46:35,658 --> 02:46:40,061
If I had shunned death or feared it,
I would not be here now...

1852
02:46:40,263 --> 02:46:42,026
...nor would you be concerned for me.

1853
02:46:42,232 --> 02:46:44,166
But, sir, please.

1854
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:46,834
I don't have the men to protect you...

1855
02:46:47,036 --> 02:46:49,834
...not in a Muslim house,
not this quarter.

1856
02:46:50,039 --> 02:46:53,133
I'm staying with the friend
of a friend and...

1857
02:46:53,343 --> 02:46:57,302
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1858
02:46:59,115 --> 02:47:00,980
Why are you staying
at the home of a Muslim?

1859
02:47:01,184 --> 02:47:02,515
They are murderers!

1860
02:47:02,719 --> 02:47:03,981
They killed my family!

1861
02:47:04,187 --> 02:47:06,121
Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!

1862
02:47:06,322 --> 02:47:09,086
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1863
02:47:58,308 --> 02:47:59,240
Prime Minister.

1864
02:48:04,013 --> 02:48:06,243
Why must I read news
like this in the paper?

1865
02:48:12,021 --> 02:48:14,717
Inform Sardar Patel.
Arrange a plane.

1866
02:48:15,191 --> 02:48:16,419
We will go Friday.

1867
02:48:17,327 --> 02:48:18,419
Four days, sir?

1868
02:48:52,161 --> 02:48:54,789
Sardar, you have gained weight.

1869
02:48:54,997 --> 02:48:57,192
You must join me in the fast.

1870
02:48:57,400 --> 02:48:59,868
If I fast, I die.

1871
02:49:00,536 --> 02:49:04,529
If you fast, people go to
all sorts of trouble...

1872
02:49:04,741 --> 02:49:06,072
...to keep you alive.

1873
02:49:07,310 --> 02:49:09,073
Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.

1874
02:49:09,612 --> 02:49:11,705
I could have come earlier...

1875
02:49:11,914 --> 02:49:14,348
...but your fast has helped.

1876
02:49:14,984 --> 02:49:18,750
These last days, people's minds
have begun to turn to this bed...

1877
02:49:18,955 --> 02:49:20,889
...and away from the atrocities.

1878
02:49:21,090 --> 02:49:22,079
But now...

1879
02:49:23,025 --> 02:49:24,185
...it is enough.

1880
02:49:26,763 --> 02:49:30,961
All that has happened is that
I've grown a little thinner.

1881
02:49:34,804 --> 02:49:38,365
Tomorrow, 5,000 Muslim students...

1882
02:49:38,574 --> 02:49:39,871
...of all ages...

1883
02:49:40,076 --> 02:49:43,705
...are marching here,
in Calcutta, for peace.

1884
02:49:44,480 --> 02:49:48,177
And 5,000 Hindu students
are marching with them.

1885
02:49:49,252 --> 02:49:50,742
I'm glad.

1886
02:49:51,754 --> 02:49:54,348
But it will not be enough.

1887
02:50:10,406 --> 02:50:13,842
You are not so young anymore.

1888
02:50:14,310 --> 02:50:15,902
Don't worry for me.

1889
02:50:17,246 --> 02:50:21,774
I cannot watch the destruction
of all that I've lived for.

1890
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:32,678
Death to Gandhi!

1891
02:51:32,955 --> 02:51:35,253
Who dares say such things?

1892
02:51:35,558 --> 02:51:36,582
Who?

1893
02:51:38,294 --> 02:51:41,161
You kill me first!

1894
02:51:42,131 --> 02:51:43,098
Come!

1895
02:51:46,235 --> 02:51:47,532
Where are you?

1896
02:51:48,504 --> 02:51:50,233
Kill me first!

1897
02:51:53,242 --> 02:51:54,607
Where are you?

1898
02:52:05,021 --> 02:52:08,684
His pulse is very irregular.
The kidneys aren't functioning.

1899
02:52:24,206 --> 02:52:26,731
I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.

1900
02:52:27,143 --> 02:52:31,079
It was he who called
on the Muslims to rise.

1901
02:52:31,347 --> 02:52:32,905
He is now telling them...

1902
02:52:33,416 --> 02:52:35,884
...to go back to their homes...

1903
02:52:36,085 --> 02:52:38,110
...to lay down their arms.

1904
02:52:50,633 --> 02:52:52,760
Think what you can do by living...

1905
02:52:53,135 --> 02:52:56,298
...that you cannot do by dying.

1906
02:53:05,815 --> 02:53:08,181
What do you want?

1907
02:53:11,587 --> 02:53:14,454
That the fighting will stop.

1908
02:53:14,657 --> 02:53:17,148
That you make me believe...

1909
02:53:20,029 --> 02:53:22,691
...that it will never start again.

1910
02:53:32,274 --> 02:53:33,434
Sometimes...

1911
02:53:33,643 --> 02:53:37,443
...it is when you are
quite without hope...

1912
02:53:38,147 --> 02:53:41,241
...and in utter darkness...

1913
02:53:41,951 --> 02:53:45,114
...that God comes to the rescue.

1914
02:53:46,989 --> 02:53:48,422
Gandhiji...

1915
02:53:48,924 --> 02:53:50,448
...is dying...

1916
02:53:52,361 --> 02:53:55,057
...because of our madness.

1917
02:53:56,732 --> 02:53:59,496
Put away your revenge.

1918
02:53:59,835 --> 02:54:03,362
What good will come of more killing?

1919
02:54:04,573 --> 02:54:07,007
Have the courage to do...

1920
02:54:07,209 --> 02:54:10,042
...what you know is right.

1921
02:54:11,147 --> 02:54:13,047
For God's sake...

1922
02:54:13,683 --> 02:54:15,651
...let us embrace...

1923
02:54:15,851 --> 02:54:17,580
...like brothers.

1924
02:54:31,534 --> 02:54:33,399
It's our promise.

1925
02:54:34,136 --> 02:54:35,262
We stop.

1926
02:54:38,007 --> 02:54:39,702
Hindu swords.

1927
02:54:41,177 --> 02:54:42,644
It's a promise.

1928
02:54:46,148 --> 02:54:46,978
Go.

1929
02:54:49,185 --> 02:54:50,652
God be with you.

1930
02:55:03,566 --> 02:55:05,124
Here, eat!

1931
02:55:06,502 --> 02:55:07,491
Eat!

1932
02:55:09,305 --> 02:55:10,772
I'm going to hell...

1933
02:55:11,240 --> 02:55:13,800
...but not with your death
on my soul.

1934
02:55:14,310 --> 02:55:17,768
Only God decides who goes to hell.

1935
02:55:18,180 --> 02:55:19,977
I killed a child.

1936
02:55:21,617 --> 02:55:24,415
I smashed his head against a wall.

1937
02:55:26,155 --> 02:55:27,281
Why?

1938
02:55:29,658 --> 02:55:31,455
They killed my son.

1939
02:55:34,663 --> 02:55:35,891
My boy.

1940
02:55:38,033 --> 02:55:40,524
The Muslims killed my son!

1941
02:55:45,441 --> 02:55:48,774
I know a way out of hell.

1942
02:55:50,479 --> 02:55:52,845
Find a child.

1943
02:55:53,048 --> 02:55:57,485
A child whose mother and father
have been killed.

1944
02:55:58,487 --> 02:56:02,924
A little boy about this high...

1945
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:07,188
...and raise him as your own.

1946
02:56:10,900 --> 02:56:14,233
Only be sure that he is a Muslim...

1947
02:56:16,005 --> 02:56:19,133
...and that you raise him as one.

1948
02:56:46,936 --> 02:56:47,766
Go.

1949
02:56:49,205 --> 02:56:50,035
Go.

1950
02:56:52,107 --> 02:56:53,369
God bless you.

1951
02:57:20,336 --> 02:57:21,325
<i>Bapu?</i>

1952
02:57:27,910 --> 02:57:30,276
There's been no fighting...

1953
02:57:30,880 --> 02:57:31,938
...anywhere.

1954
02:57:33,315 --> 02:57:34,748
It's stopped.

1955
02:57:35,551 --> 02:57:38,145
The madness has stopped.

1956
02:57:42,224 --> 02:57:43,782
It's foolish...

1957
02:57:43,993 --> 02:57:47,724
...if it's just to save
the life of an old man.

1958
02:57:49,765 --> 02:57:52,893
In every temple and mosque...

1959
02:57:53,235 --> 02:57:55,396
...they have pledged to die...

1960
02:57:55,671 --> 02:57:58,572
...before they lift a hand
against each other.

1961
02:58:01,143 --> 02:58:02,872
It is true, Bapu.

1962
02:58:10,986 --> 02:58:12,681
Everywhere.

1963
02:58:47,489 --> 02:58:49,889
Maulana, my friend...

1964
02:58:51,894 --> 02:58:54,419
...could I have some orange juice?

1965
02:59:01,403 --> 02:59:02,995
Then you and I...

1966
02:59:03,205 --> 02:59:06,140
...will take a piece
of bread together.

1967
02:59:36,338 --> 02:59:38,568
He will be saying prayers
in the garden.

1968
02:59:47,049 --> 02:59:48,880
<i>That is how you eat muli.</i>

1969
02:59:49,685 --> 02:59:52,347
I'm not sure that I want
to be remembered that way.

1970
02:59:52,554 --> 02:59:54,647
Don't worry.
With luck, you may not be.

1971
02:59:54,857 --> 02:59:58,486
No, he will be remembered
for tempting fate.

1972
02:59:59,661 --> 03:00:00,889
Mickey Mouse!

1973
03:00:02,698 --> 03:00:04,757
So you really are going
to Pakistan then?

1974
03:00:09,705 --> 03:00:11,536
You are a stubborn man.

1975
03:00:13,542 --> 03:00:15,533
I'm simply going to prove...

1976
03:00:15,744 --> 03:00:18,372
...to Hindus here
and Muslims there...

1977
03:00:18,647 --> 03:00:21,810
...that the only devils
in the world are those...

1978
03:00:22,017 --> 03:00:24,542
...running around in our own hearts.

1979
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:28,578
And that is where all our battles
ought to be fought.

1980
03:00:36,131 --> 03:00:37,598
So what kind of warrior...

1981
03:00:37,800 --> 03:00:40,997
...have you been in that warfare?

1982
03:00:42,571 --> 03:00:44,334
Not a very good one.

1983
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:47,236
That's why I have
so much tolerance...

1984
03:00:47,443 --> 03:00:50,708
...for the other scoundrels
of the world.

1985
03:00:55,217 --> 03:00:56,047
Sardar?

1986
03:00:57,052 --> 03:01:00,510
Ask Panditji to consider
what we've discussed.

1987
03:01:06,962 --> 03:01:09,157
- Enough!
- One more.

1988
03:01:09,531 --> 03:01:10,657
You're a temptress.

1989
03:01:10,866 --> 03:01:12,231
Just an admirer.

1990
03:01:12,434 --> 03:01:14,459
Nothing's more dangerous...

1991
03:01:14,803 --> 03:01:16,771
...especially for an old man.

1992
03:01:26,415 --> 03:01:28,508
There's a sadness about him.

1993
03:01:30,185 --> 03:01:32,085
He thinks he's failed.

1994
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:33,311
Why?

1995
03:01:33,722 --> 03:01:37,214
If anything's proven him right,
it's these last months.

1996
03:01:38,827 --> 03:01:41,523
I may be blinded by my love for him...

1997
03:01:42,097 --> 03:01:43,564
...but I believe...

1998
03:01:43,799 --> 03:01:45,824
...when we most needed it...

1999
03:01:46,034 --> 03:01:49,197
...he offered the world
a way out of madness.

2000
03:01:51,940 --> 03:01:53,373
But he doesn't see it.

2001
03:01:54,276 --> 03:01:56,107
Neither does the world.

2002
03:02:29,645 --> 03:02:31,806
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

2003
03:02:34,550 --> 03:02:36,142
<i>Oh, God!</i>

2004
03:03:17,726 --> 03:03:19,717
<i>When I despair...</i>

2005
03:03:20,028 --> 03:03:21,928
<i>...I remember...</i>

2006
03:03:22,264 --> 03:03:24,494
<i>...that all through history...</i>

2007
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:28,693
<i>...the way of truth and love
has always won.</i>

2008
03:03:31,039 --> 03:03:34,668
<i>There have been tyrants
and murderers...</i>

2009
03:03:34,876 --> 03:03:37,902
<i>...and for a time,
they can seem invincible...</i>

2010
03:03:38,113 --> 03:03:41,549
<i>...but in the end, they always fall.</i>

2011
03:03:43,285 --> 03:03:44,809
<i>Think of it.</i>

2012
03:03:46,622 --> 03:03:47,816
<i>Always.</i>
