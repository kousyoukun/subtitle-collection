you take care of Cujo here

and alert the owner that he needs
a new watchdog for the site, okay?

I can't imagine how
hard this is on you.

that we're all here for you.

that I don't blame you

for being a little
off right now.

93
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,942
But it's these
lapses in judgment?

94

I need you back, Neil.

95

I need all of you back.

Oh, don't be a jackass.

97
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,450
Put that back on.

98
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,784
Could've gotten you killed.

99
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,920
Yeah, Gibson could've shot me.

100
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,123
And between us, I think
he's after my job.

101

I don't know, Mike. I just...

to the best of my
ability right now.

105
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,667
Well, then take some time off.

106
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,301
Some real time off.

107
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,137
You and Abby should get away.

Give yourself a break.

Ah, shut up. I didn't feel anything
until you made me laugh, asshole.

Fuck a duck! Goddamn it, Helen.

You sure you know
what you're doing?

[Helen] Look. Stop
that swearing, Chief.

You know I don't allow
swearing in my office.

Well, then stop
the torture, woman.

It's nothing. I'm fine.

Do I need to ask who told you?

126
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,349
Sorry, Chief. She
caught me on the way in.

are vaccinated, right?

what's wrong with these animals.

Hmm. It's gotta be rabies.

No, it doesn't gotta be rabies.

- [Olivia] I don't care.

You're going to the

Hi, Mr. Morris.

148
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,908
Olivia, you can call me Neil.

149
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,610
You know that.

150
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,279
I've been wanting to
talk to you since...

151

Don't worry about it.

152
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,117
This has been very
hard on everybody.

153

Including you.

154
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,488
So, I... I get it.

155
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,825
I found some stuff of Ben's.

Comics and stuff.

I've been wanting
to bring them by,

158
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,016
but I know that you're moving to
the Granville's old place, so...

159
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,902
Well, whatever you found,
you can hang on to.

160
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,371
I'm sure he'd want
you to have it.

161
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,407
I know this meant a lot to him.

162

Look, I believe you, and I'm sorry
I've been a massive pain in the ass,

491
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,944
but I just... I need
you to explain to me...

492
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,846
- Please stop talking.
- What is happening...

493
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,348
- Stop talking.
- Because I'm scared.

494
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,151
- Stop talking!
- You're scaring me!

495
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,386
I need you to listen.

496
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:36,854
Not talk.

497
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,024
Okay? Listen, not talk.

498
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:40,226
You can do that, right?

499
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,229
I'm listening and not talking.

500
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,130
Oh, God! Just... you're still...

501
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,897
You're still talking.

502
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:47,899
Okay.

503
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:53,204
[clears throat] Something
very bad is happening, okay?

504
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:57,975
Everybody in Mourning Rock,
and maybe everybody everywhere,

I don't know, is infected

506
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,051
or they're gonna be, by
whatever the fuck this is,

507
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:07,786
and they're gonna be violent,

508
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,491
and they're gonna be not
who we know them to be,

509
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,495
and yeah.

514
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,707
Yeah, go ahead.

515
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,811
Why?

516
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,647
Why would this be happening?

517
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,617
Like, people turn into monsters, and then
they start killing each other for fun.

518

I don't know. I
don't... I don't know.

519
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:46,291
It's some kind of viral
mutation or something,

520
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,159
maybe from the shitty
water or the...

we get coming up from the city?

a fucking scientist.

523
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:57,002
All I know is that...
that something bad

524
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,171
and not normal is going on

525

[Neil] We stop by the
house, get some supplies,

533
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,001
and we'll uh, we'll
go to Mike's house,

534
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:34,139
'cause Mike will know
what to do, right?

535
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,707
How do we know that
Mike's not infected?

536

Right.

537
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,883

- What?

538
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,186
By a dog. Not a crazy person,

539
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:50,088
but the... the dog was
pretty fucking crazy.

540
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,858
When did he get
attacked by a dog?

541
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,026
Yesterday.

542
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,728
Did he go to the hospital?

543
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,330
I called 911. I
called everybody.

544
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,731
No, he didn't go
to the hospital.

545
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,401
Helen looked at
him, okay? At the...

546
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,538
Okay.

547

[somber music playing]

548
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,452
[Neil] I'm gonna run in and
grab a couple of things.

549
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,089
Please, just stay here.

550
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:25,724
Lock the doors.

551
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:30,896
Hey.

552
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,830
I heard you.

553
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,137

What are you doing?
We got to go.

558
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,676
[Abby] He'd be just getting
home from band practice now,

559
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,211
and he'd walk straight to
the fridge and dive in.

560
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,982
I'd say, "Just a little
snack before dinner."

561
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:00,018
He'd just smile.

562
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:05,356
He'd kiss my nose, and he'd say,

563
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:08,527
"You're fed, but hunger
still gnaws at you."

I know... I know you think I'm
crazy. Neil, but he's out there.

570
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,124
I can feel it. I can feel him.

571
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,460
We need to keep looking.

572
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,303
We got to go.

573
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,071
We got to get to Mike's.

574
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,873
But what if he comes back?

575
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:56,875
We're not here.

576
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,914
Hey, Ben's...

577
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,216
He's smart, right?

578
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,353
He comes back, we're not here.

579
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:09,954
He's... he's gonna go
straight to Mike's.

580
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,661
- You think?
- Yeah, 'cause Olivia is there, too.

581
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:20,865
Right? And... [inhales]
I'm saying we just...

582
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,800
Let's... let's get there...

583
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,234
- Okay.
- And we'll...

584
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,104
We'll figure it out together.

585
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,473
- Right?
- Together, yeah.

586
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,774
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

587

- Okay. Come on.
- Yeah.

588
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,546
Wait, do you think he
could have been infected,

589
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,147
like those things that you saw?

590
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,385
Or maybe he's hiding
because he saw them, too.

591
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:43,388
Like you.

592
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:45,869
Okay, but you know what? I'm
just... I'm gonna leave him a note.

593
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,327
Are you gonna leave him some
fucking milk and cookies, too?

594

Well, if you wanted
me dead that bad,

00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,380
you shouldn't have
taken my ammo.

598
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,850
Sorry.

599
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,752
- I did not mean that.
- Where is it?

600
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:15,821
What?

601
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,855
