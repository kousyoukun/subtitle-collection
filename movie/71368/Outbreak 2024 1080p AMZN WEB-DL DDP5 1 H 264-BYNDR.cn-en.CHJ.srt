什么？
What?

00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,540
你的意思是他喜欢我
You mean he is fond of me

143
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,028
是的
Right

144
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,316
是啊,嗯…

嘿,哥们 送你回家吗？

你认为其他州立公园有收音机吗？
You think other state parks have radios that actually,

159
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,577
你知道,工作吗？
you know,work?

160
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,495
我的意思是,即使在《闪灵》中,护林站仍然可以联系
I mean,even in The Shining,the ranger's station could still get in touch

161
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,698
和 俯瞰 一起,对吧？
with the Overlook,right?

00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,519
我是说,即使是在暴风雪中
I mean,even in a goddamn snowstorm

163
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,203
嗯,直到杰克把收音机里的电子管拿下来
Well,until Jack,you know,took the tubes out of the radio

164
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,339
并让雪地车无法行驶,就像,
and disabled the snowcat and was like,

165
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,560
“快去看看！”
"Go check it out!"

166
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,430
去看看吧
Go check it out

167
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,033
然后温迪,记住……
And then Wendy,remember

168
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:44,357
那么,呃,长官给了你一些休假时间,是吗？
So,uh,the Chief gave you some time off,huh?

169
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,946
你可以这么说,他让我休假了
You can say it,he put me on leave

170
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,529
我不怪他
I don't blame him for it

171
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,989
今天的事情可能发生在任何人身上
Today could have happened to anybody

172
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,453
你知道吧？
You know that,right?

173
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,874
嗯,听着,我...你知道,我明天休息
Well,look,I you know,I'm off tomorrow

174
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,209
我要去我妈妈家
I'm just gonna head up to my mom's

175
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,945
她正在做她著名的桃子苹果派
She's making her famous peach apple pie

176
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,999
你想来吗？
You wanna come?

177
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,037
呃…
Uh

178
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:14,287
你知道,周一搬家工人会来,
You know,we got movers coming on Monday,

179
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,890
因此,在此之前还有很多事情要做
so,a lot of stuff to do before that

180
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,491
不过还是谢谢你
Thank you,though

181
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,761
明白了,明白了 好的
Got it,got it Okay

182
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,231
好吧,我不能保证任何馅饼都能回来
Well,I cannot guarantee any pie will make it back

183
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:28,554
但我会努力的
upon my return,but I will try

184
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,438
因为你是个自私的混蛋
'Cause you're a selfish bastard

185
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,393
他就在那儿
There he is

186
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,696
你知道吗,你妈妈比喜欢你更喜欢我,对吧？
You know,your mom likes me more than you,right?

187
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,014
但她……她没这么说,对吧？
She she didn't say that,though,right?

188
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,750
你以为我在开玩笑吗？她告诉我的
You think I'm joking? She told me that

189
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,118
上次她给了我一些馅饼 哥们,闭嘴 别再这样了
Last time she gave me some pie Dude,shut up Stop it

190
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,454
是的
Yeah

191
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:51,277
她绝不会这么说 她爱我
She would never say that She loves me

192
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,964
好的,记住,如果你需要什么,请拨打幸运 13 频道
All right,remember,if you need anything,lucky channel 13

193
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,698

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,701
我可以开车送你走完剩下的路,尼尔
I can drive you up the rest of the way,Neil

196
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,837
我又不是要向你收取汽油费
It's not like I'm charging you for gas

197
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,106
没关系 我需要散散步
It's okay I need the walk

198
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,441
因为每周 90 英里对你来说不够
'Cause 90 miles a week ain't enough for you

199
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,710
得多走一千步吧？
Gotta get your extra thousand steps in,huh?

200
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,179
晚安,吉布斯
Good night,Gibbs

201
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,380
谢谢载我
Thanks for the ride

202
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,369
嗯,代我向你妈妈问好,好吗？
Um,give your mom my best,okay?

203
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,514
该死的
Shit

204
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,387
嘿,尼尔
Hey,Neil

205
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,024
坚持住,朋友 嗯…
Hold up,bud Um

206
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,928
你得跟我谈谈,朋友
You gotta talk to me,man

207
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,638
我很担心你
I'm worried about you

208
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,488
我知道
I know

209
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,924
我想帮助你,尼尔
I want to help you,Neil

210
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,278
是啊,瞧,我……
Yeah,see,I

211
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,263
我不再需要任何人的帮助
I don't need any more help from anybody

212
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,584
只是...不是...
It's just it's not

213
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,401
一点用都没有 你懂我的意思吗？
Not fucking helpful You know what I mean?

214
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,404
我的意思是,我听到了你的声音,但你是我最好的朋友
I mean,I hear you,but you're my best friend

215
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,507
好吗？你是我最亲近的兄弟
Okay? You're the closest thing that I've ever had to a brother

216
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,109
我只是......我不能站在这里
and I just I can't stand here

217
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,178
然后看着你逐渐萎缩
and just watch you just shrivel into yourself

218
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,300
这不对,这不是兄弟该做的事
It's not right It's not what brothers do

219
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:29,508
你对我和艾比都很好
You've been really good to me and to Abby

220
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,743
在过去的几个月里
over the last few months

221
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,527
我知道这并不容易
And I know it hasn't been easy

222
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,396
哦,朋友
Oh,man

223
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,631
善待他人并不容易,尼尔
Being good to people ain't about it being easy,Neil

224
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,819
这正是我们所做的
It's just what we do

225
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,604
我的意思是,自从我认识你以来,你就一直是我的榜样
I mean,long as I've known you,you've led by example

226
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,459
我只是想追随这个思路
and I'm just trying to follow that lead

227
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,032
我很感激
I appreciate that

228
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,537
嘿
Hey

229
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:03,976
为什么你不给我们带一些著名的馅饼回来呢？
Why don't you um,just bring us back some of that famous pie?

230
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,278
嗯,我可以做到
Well,that I can do

231
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,783
无论你需要什么,尼尔 我都会在这里为你服务
Whatever you need,Neil I'm here for you

232
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,051
嘿
Hey

233
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,190
你还好吗？

234
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,094
是啊,只是还是很累
Yeah,just still so tired

235
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,032
你回家真早啊

00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,903
嗯,快到七点了

237
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,209
哦,该死 哦
Oh,shit Oh

238
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,947
就这样吧 一切都还好吗？
There you go Everything okay?

239
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,398
嗯...
Um

240
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,532
嗯
Uh

241
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,587
噢,是的,很好
Oh,yeah,fine

242
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,436
你是否...
Did you

243
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,776
您还打包了其他东西吗？
Did you get any more packing done?

244
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,008
是的
Yeah

245
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,110
我是说,我只是...
I mean,I just

246
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,479
我有点精疲力尽了
I kind of just ran out of steam

247
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,134
是的
Yeah

248
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,104
嗯,没关系
Yeah,it's okay

249
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,020
别担心
Don't worry about it

250
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,574
我们会把一切都完成的
We will get it all done

251
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,557
不不不 别……别碰任何东西
No,no,no Don't don't touch anything

252
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,560
我需要这里的所有这一切
I need all of this here

253
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,362
这些是我的回忆,我需要……
These are my memories and I need

254
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,231
我现在就需要它们
I need them right now

255
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,252
只是...
Just

256
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,887
不要碰任何东西
Don't touch anything

257
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,395
您知道我们将所有这些都存储在某个云端
You know we have all these in a cloud somewhere

258
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,799
关于技术的最好的事情
Best thing about technology

259
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,269
更加整洁
Less clutter

260
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,506
我不会因悲伤而道歉
I'm not gonna apologize for grieving

261
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,509
我没要求你这么做
I'm not asking you to

262
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,728
我也没有要求我这么做
I'm not asking me to either

263
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,397
我甚至每次经过他的房间都会有这样的感觉
I can't even walk by his room without feeling like

264
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,199
我的心都要碎了
my fucking heart's gonna cave in,

265
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,854
这不对...这是不对的
and that's just not that's not right

266
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,661
这对我们俩都不好
It's not good for either one of us

267
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,498
我同意
I agree

268
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,835
我只是不相信他已经走了
I just don't believe that he's gone

269
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,640
如果...
If

270
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,179
还有许多地方我们还没有去过
There's so many places we haven't looked

271
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,119
本不会回来了
Ben is not coming back

272
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:06,806
我知道你和我都不希望这是真的,
I know that you and I both want that to not be real,

273
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,894
但事实确实如此
but it is

274
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,230
他走了
He's gone

275
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,803
因此,我们...
So,we

276
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,540
我们必须停止自欺欺人,对吧？我们……
We gotta stop bullshitting ourselves,right? We

277
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,790
我们必须开始审视生活的本质,
We gotta start looking at life for what it is,

278
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,412
这不是我们需要的
not what we need it to be

279
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,382
但我们怎么知道呢？
But how do we know?

280
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,818
我们什么都不知道
We don't know anything

281
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,803
我们……而我……我应该让他走吗,因为他不在这里？
We And I'm I'm just supposed to let him go,because he's not here?

282
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,606
尼尔,他 17 岁 任何事情都可能发生
Neil,he's 17 Anything could have happened

283
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,341
任何可怕的,
Any of the terrible,

284
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,463
世界上发生的可怕的事情
awful things that happen in the world

285
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,780
任何事情都有可能发生
Anything could have happened

286
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,935
你知道？
You know?

287
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,852
任何事情...而他还在那里
Anything And he's still out there

288
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,907
我们只需要继续寻找他
We just have to keep looking for him

289
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,357
就像...
It was like

290
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,960
我……我来过这里,而且我……
I I went here,and I

291
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,048
尼尔！
Neil!

292
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:35,441
我们现在要开始分房睡吗？
We're gonna start sleeping in separate rooms now?

293
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,158
嗯...
Mm

294
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,348
抱歉,我只是累了
I'm sorry I was just tired

295
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,253
过来一下
Come here for a second

296
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,088
为什么？ 因为我要求你这么做
Why? 'Cause I asked you to

297
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,109
到这儿来
Come here

298
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,815
好啦,闭上眼睛
All right,close your eyes

299
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,819
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes

300
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,591
深呼吸
Deep breath

301
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,165
打开它们
Open 'em

302
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,273
“深入观察自然
"Look deep into nature

303
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:53,178
然后你就会更好地理解一切 ”
and then you will understand everything better "

304
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,297
哇 这确实不是我听过的最棒的名言
Wow That's really not the greatest quote that I've ever heard

305
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,954
谁说的？ 爱因斯坦,爱因斯坦
Who said that? Einstein,Einstein

306
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,425
好的
Okay

307
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:12,130
所以,我一直想把这个给你
So,I've been wanting to give you this for a while

308
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,913
现在就做 不,爸爸,你不是认真的
Gonna do it now No,dad,you're not serious

309
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,482
那是爷爷的手表 那是爷爷的手表
That's Grandpa's watch That's Grandpa's watch

310
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,769
是啊,是爷爷的……
Yeah,it's Grandpa's

311
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,881
总是让我想起什么......
Always kind of reminded me of what

312
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,445
什么才是真正重要的？
what really matters

313
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,355
也许它会以自己的方式为你做同样的事情
Maybe it'll do the same for you in its own way

314
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,103
这太模拟了
This is so analog

315
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,958
我就像一位朝圣者
I'm like a pilgrim

316
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,240
你必须把它卷起来
You gotta wind it

317
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
每周一次
Once a week

318
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:46,913

322
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,082

好的,我们很好
Okay,we're good

324
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:53,592
小姐,你还好吗？你还好吗？
Miss,you okay? You all right?

325
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,602
啊,放开我！
Ah,get off me!

326
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,426
他妈的
Fuck

327
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,626
艾比！
Abby!

328
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,295
艾比,快起来！我们得走了！

就这样吧 来吧,来吧,来吧
That's it Come on,come on,come on

332
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,780
好的
Okay

333
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:58,698
呃,任何能听到我的人,这是......
Uh,anybody who can hear me,this is

334
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:02,401
我是护林员尼尔·莫里斯,目前在我住处,
this is Ranger Neil Morris,currently at my residence,

335
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,923
哀悼岩露营地
Mourning Rock Campground

336
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,638
有人能听到我的声音吗？
Can anybody hear me?

337
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,351
你把我所有的弹药都拿去干什么了？
What did you do with all my ammo?

338
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,502
你打光了我的……你打光了我的枪
You emptied my you emptied my gun

339
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,857
我很担心你
I was worried about you

340
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,561
呃呃……
Urgh

341
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,899
天啊 我是说,我们在干什么？
Jesus Christ I mean,what the What are we doing?

342
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,903
我在徒步旅行时看到有人溺水,
I was out on my hike,and I saw somebody drowning,

343
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,671
因此我尝试去帮忙
and so I tried to help

344
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,508
我被这个该死的东西袭击了
I got attacked by this fucking thing

345
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:25,177
我不知道那是什么,但我认为还有很多
I don't know what it was,but I think there's more of 'em

346
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,847
我不知道它是否只在这里出现,还是无处不在,
And I don't know if it's just here or if it's everywhere,

347
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:31,102
但我们不会留下来寻找答案
but we are not sticking the fuck around to find out

348
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,373
什么？
What?

349
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,708
他妈的
Fuck

350
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,546
哦
Oh

351
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,983
吉布森,我是尼尔 嘿
Gibson,it's Neil Hey

352
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:48,935

Gibson,can you hear me? Listen,if you're hearing if you can hear me,

353
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:52,090
朋友,有些疯狂的事情正在发生
there's some crazy shit going on,man

354
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:15,213
那儿！这个！看见那个了吗？
There! This! See that?

355
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:19,455
我们必须尽力营救尽可能多的人
We gotta try and get as many people out of here as we can

356
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:41,006
该死,尼尔,这到底是怎么回事？
Dammit Neil,what the fuck?

357
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,618
系好安全带
Put a seatbelt on

358
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:56,154
系好两条安全带
Put both seatbelts on

359
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,486
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

360
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,908
我跟你一起走在前面
I'm coming in front with you

361
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:48,005
尼尔？
Neil?

362
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,723
尼尔,你能告诉我……
Neil,can you tell me

363
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,345
请告诉我发生了什么事
Please just tell me what's going on

364
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,362
尼尔！
Neil!

365
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:59,831
那么,有某种狂暴的野生怪物在逃吗？
So,there's some like,rabid wild monster on the loose?

366
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,735
事情是这样的？我们就是...... 怪物
And that's the deal? That's what we're Monsters

367
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,755
复数
Plural

368
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,907
如果你能睁开眼睛超过半秒钟,
If you can maybe keep your eyes open for more than half a second,

369
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,263
你也许能看到我们在这里面临的是什么
you might be able to see what we're up against here

370
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,052
好吧,我知道发生的一切都是真实的
Okay,I know whatever is happening is real

371
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,354
对你来说现在就是这样,而你不只是……
for you right now,and you're not just

372
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:25,357
听着,我相信你,我很抱歉给你带来这么多麻烦,
Look,I believe you,and I'm sorry I've been a massive pain in the ass,

373
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,925
但我只是……我需要你向我解释……
but I just I need you to explain to me

374
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,827
请别再说话了 发生什么事了……
Please stop talking What is happening

375
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,329
别说话了 因为我害怕
Stop talking Because I'm scared

376
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:33,151
别说话！ 你吓到我了！
Stop talking! You're scaring me!

377
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,367
我需要你听我说
I need you to listen

378
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:36,835
不说话
Not talk

379
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,005
好吗？听着,别说话
Okay? Listen,not talk

380
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,226
你能做到,对吧？
You can do that,right?

381
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,475
我只是在听,不说话
I'm listening and not talking

382
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,111
哦,天啊！只是……你仍然……
Oh,God! Just you're still

383
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,878
你还在说话
You're still talking

384
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,747
好的
Okay

385
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:53,185
一些非常糟糕的事情正在发生,好吗？
Something very bad is happening,okay?

386
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:57,956
哀悼岩的每个人,或许是世界各地的每个人,
Everybody in Mourning Rock,and maybe everybody everywhere,

387
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,961
我不知道,被感染了
I don't know,is infected

388
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,032
或者他们会,不管这是什么鬼,
or they're gonna be,by whatever the fuck this is,

389
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:08,786
他们会变得暴力,
and they're gonna be violent,

390
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:13,491
他们将会不再是我们认识的那样,
and they're gonna be not who we know them to be,

391
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,495
是的
and yeah

392
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,800
他们将会来接我们
They're gonna be coming to get us

393
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,205
我现在可以讲话吗？
Can I talk now?

394
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,707
嗯,请说
Yeah,go ahead

395
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,811
为什么？
Why?

396
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,528
为什么会发生这种情况？
Why would this be happening?

397
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,598
就像人们变成了怪物,然后他们开始为了好玩而互相残杀
Like,people turn into monsters,and then they start killing each other for fun

398
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,653
我不知道 我不知道……我不知道
I don't know I don't I don't know

399
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:46,272
这是某种病毒变异,或者其他什么原因,
It's some kind of viral mutation or something,

400
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,140
也许是来自肮脏的水或......
maybe from the shitty water or the

401
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,410
从城市里飘出来的空气真他妈的有毒？
toxic fucking air we get coming up from the city?

402
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,911
我不知道 我他妈又不是科学家
I don't know I'm not a fucking scientist

403
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:58,002
我只知道...有些不好的事情
All I know is that that something bad

404
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,152
并且不正常的事情正在发生
and not normal is going on

405
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:04,475
我们只需要尽可能远离
and we just got to get as far away as we can

406
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,180
是的
Yeah

407
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,368
好的
Okay,then

408
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,036
好的
Okay

409
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,639
我们要穿过城镇 城镇是唯一的出路
We're gonna go through town Town's the only way out

410
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,728
这就是城镇
Town it is

411
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,947
我们到房子旁边停下,拿些补给品,
We stop by the house,get some supplies,

412
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,982
然后我们去迈克家,
and we'll uh,we'll go to Mike's house,

413
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:34,120
因为迈克知道该​​怎么做,对吧？
'cause Mike will know what to do,right?

414
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,707
我们怎么知道麦克没有被感染？
How do we know that Mike's not infected?

415
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,894
是的
Right

416
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,883
他被袭击了 什么？
He got attacked What?

417
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,167
被一条狗 不是一个疯子,
By a dog Not a crazy person,

418
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:51,088
但是...那只狗真是太疯狂了
but the the dog was pretty fucking crazy

419
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,839
他什么时候被狗袭击过？
When did he get attacked by a dog?

420
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,026
昨天
Yesterday

421
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,709
他去医院了吗？
Did he go to the hospital?

422
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,311
我拨打了 911 我给每个人都打了电话
I called 911 I called everybody

423
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,712
不,他没有去医院
No,he didn't go to the hospital

424
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,401
海伦看着他,好吗？在……
Helen looked at him,okay? At the

425
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:07,538
好的
Okay

426
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,433
我要跑进去拿几件东西
I'm gonna run in and grab a couple of things

427
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,703
请你就留在这里
Please,just stay here

428
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,724
锁上门
Lock the doors

429
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,810
嘿
Hey

430
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,830
我听到了
I heard you

431
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,694
该死的,艾比
Goddamn it,Abby

432
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,220
你在干什么？我们得走了
What are you doing? We got to go

433
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,390
他现在应该刚从乐队练习回家,
He'd be just getting home from band practice now,

434
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,192
然后他会直接走到冰箱前,然后一头扎进去
and he'd walk straight to the fridge and dive in

435
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,982
我会说：“晚饭前吃点小零食 ”
I'd say,"Just a little snack before dinner "

436
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:01,018
他只是微笑
He'd just smile

437
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:05,337
他会亲吻我的鼻子,然后说,
He'd kiss my nose,and he'd say,

438
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:09,527
“你吃饱了,但饥饿感仍旧折磨着你 ”
"You're fed,but hunger still gnaws at you "

439
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:16,567
斯坦贝克 对,就是他妈斯坦贝克
Steinbeck Yeah,it's fucking Steinbeck

440
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,188
哦... 哦... 嘿
Oh Oh Hey

441
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:26,877
我想要我的可爱儿子回来
I want my sweet boy back

442
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:36,902
我知道……我知道你觉得我疯了 尼尔,但他就在那儿
I know I know you think I'm crazy Neil,but he's out there

443
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,124
我能感觉到 我能感觉到他
I can feel it I can feel him

444
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,460
我们需要继续寻找
We need to keep looking

445
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,950
我们得走了
We got to go

446
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,071
我们得去迈克家
We got to get to Mike's

447
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,854
但如果他回来怎么办？
But what if he comes back?

448
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,875
我们不在这儿
We're not here

449
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:03,629
嘿,本的……
Hey,Ben's

450
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,216
他很聪明,对吧？
He's smart,right?

451
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,334
他回来了,我们不在这里
He comes back,we're not here

452
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:10,954
他...他要直接去迈克家
He's he's gonna go straight to Mike's

453
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:16,241
你觉得呢？ 是的,因为奥利维亚也在那里
You think? Yeah,'cause Olivia is there,too

454
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:20,846
对吧？而且...我是说我们只是...
Right? And I'm saying we just

455
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,781
我们……我们到那儿去吧……
Let's let's get there

456
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,215
好的 我们会……
Okay And we'll

457
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,104
我们会一起解决这个问题
We'll figure it out together

458
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,454
对吧？ 一起,对
Right? Together,yeah

459
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,755
是啊是啊
Yeah? Yeah

460
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:32,142
好的 来吧 是的
Okay Come on Yeah

461
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,527
等等,你认为他可能被感染了吗？
Wait,do you think he could have been infected,

462
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,128
就像你看到的那些东西一样？
like those things that you saw?

463
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,366
或者也许他躲起来了,因为他也看到了他们
Or maybe he's hiding because he saw them,too

464
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:43,369
像你一样
Like you

465
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:46,869
好的,但是你知道吗？我只是……我要给他留个纸条
Okay,but you know what? I'm just I'm gonna leave him a note

466
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,308
你还要给他留点牛奶和饼干吗？
Are you gonna leave him some fucking milk and cookies,too?

467
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,664
快点,我们得走了！去你妈的！我希望是你
Come on,we got to go! Fuck you! I wish it was you

468
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,558
好吧,如果你真的想让我死,
Well,if you wanted me dead that bad,

469
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,380
你不应该拿走我的弹药
you shouldn't have taken my ammo

470
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,850
对不起
Sorry

471
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,733
我不是那个意思 它在哪里？
I did not mean that Where is it?

472
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,502
什么？
What?

473
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,836
我的弹药
My ammo

474
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,138
子弹到了我的枪里
The bullets to my gun

475
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,561
你知道,这是我们唯一可以保护的东西
You know,the only thing we have for protection

476
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,011
我把它扔掉了
I threw it away

477
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,447
全部
All of it

478
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,182
今天垃圾回收公司也来收垃圾了 哦,太好了
And trash came to pick it up today Oh,that's great

479
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,352
我只是做我认为最好的事情
I'm just doing what I thought was best

480
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,707
就像你一样
Just like you

481
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,243
我很担心你
I was worried about you

482
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,293
你在干嘛？你现在在干嘛？
What are you doing? What are you doing now?

483
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,029
想起了我儿子的回忆
Getting memories of my son

484
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,484
没有他们我是不会离开的
I'm not leaving without them

485
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:49,019
我没问
And I'm not asking

558
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,679
你饿了
You're hungry

559
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:40,003
妈的
Oh shit

560
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,192
嘿,尼尔,我……我……我抄了 你抄了吗？
Hey,Neil,I I I copy Do you copy?

561
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:51,196
我们要去麦克·科尔特斯局长的住处,然后穿过城镇
We're gonna head to Chief Mike Cortez's place and then out through town

562
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:54,799
哥们,你在哪儿？你得跟我谈谈 来吧
Where are you,buddy? You gotta talk to me Come on

563
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:57,587
我会保持这个频道畅通
I'm gonna keep this channel open

564
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:03,641
怀着一丝希望,希望有人能听到
With the sliver of hope that somebody's listening

565
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:08,598
哦,妈的 天啊 该死的,该死的,该死的,该死的！
Oh shit God Fuck,fuck,fuck,fuck!

00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:23,247
这太疯狂了 是啊
This is crazy Yeah

567
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:26,750
那是谁或那是什么？
Who is that or what is that?

568
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,334
我不知道
I don't know

569
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:32,036
嗯,现阶段还很难说
It's uh,hard to tell at this stage

570
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:34,090
他们,嗯…
They,um

571
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:39,196
他们毫无理由地表现出攻击性
They're aggressive for no reason

572
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:43,248
它们发出可怕的噪音
They make these godawful fucking noises

573
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,784
就像他们想说话,但却不知道怎么说,就像他们……
like they're trying to speak,but they don't know how,like they

574
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,938
就像他们不记得了一样
Like they can't remember

575
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,811
噢,很有趣吗？
Oh,that's funny?

576
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,781
听起来很熟悉
It just sounds familiar

577
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:14,631
你知道,我喜欢黑甘草,而不是红甘草
You know,I like black licorice,not red

578
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:17,014
我知道 他们出去了

579
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:19,469
而且,这只会让你显得很奇怪

583
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,654
什么？子弹,这太蠢了

584

我去过别的地方 我只是……

我不知道是否有人曾帮助过你
I don't know if anybody has been there for you

I'm not sure it's possible for anyone to be there enough

for anyone

593
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:33,577
我不会放弃找到他的希望
I'm not gonna give up hope on finding him

594
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:39,916
而我将继续成为一个极其令人讨厌的人
And I will continue to be an exquisite pain in the ass

595
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,884

你相信我吧？
You trust me,right?

599
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:37,073

我接受
I'll take that

660
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,759
一点声音也没有
Not a peep

661

但他正在休假,所以我不责怪他
But he's on leave,so I don't blame him

662

而你和我之间……
And between you and me

663
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:18,602
一直以来情况都应该是这样的
That's the way it should have been this whole time

664
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21,982
没有哪个家庭应该经历这样的痛苦
No family deserves to go through what they're going through

665
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:33,669
我是护林员尼尔·莫里斯

我想,妥协了 我……

671
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:55,605
我自己也过得不太好,
And I'm not doing too good myself,

672
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:58,642
但我...我没有被感染

I don't I don't think,but I am injured,

674
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:08,604
我对这些混蛋毫无防备
and I have zero defense against these motherfuckers

675
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:14,944
每个人身上发生的事情都发生得很快
Whatever's happening to everybody is happening fast

676
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:20,449
但你不在乎,因为没人在听
But you don't care,because nobody's listening

677
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:23,067
嘿,嘿,尼尔,我是吉布斯,你收到了吗？
Hey Hey,Neil,it's Gibbs,do you copy?

01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:39,849
我正前往狼隘塔

我要通过 89 号消防路进入

Do you copy? Do you copy?

687

Neil,dude,there is no way you don't hear me,buddy

688
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:57,153
我能听到你的声音
I can hear you

689
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:05,394
该死的！
Shit!

690
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:10,493
这也许不太顺利
This might not go well

691
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:14,997
如果可以的话,坚持下去 爱你
Hang on to something if you can Love you

692
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:33,397
是啊,你觉得怎么样？
Yeah,how do you like that,huh?

693
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:36,051
你觉得怎么样？！
How do you like that?!

694
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,366
我不会离开你
