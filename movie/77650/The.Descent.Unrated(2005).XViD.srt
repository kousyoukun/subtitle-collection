1
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:08,626
Come on!

2
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,507
<i>Look out girls, here we go. </i>

3
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,425
<i>Look to the left. </i>

4
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:18,885
Paddle!

5
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:21,346
- Can you see her?
- Mummy!

6
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:31,688
Come on!

7
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:34,733
Hold on!

8
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:52,583
Christ!

9
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,169
Yes!

10
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,257
<i>- Mummy!
- Hi, guys!</i>

11
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,801
Oh, Jessie. Yeah!

12
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:05,845
That was amazing.

13
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:12,768
- Oh, you girls were screaming.
- All right, Jessie?

14
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:15,770
- That wasn't so bad, was it?
- No, it was a piece of piss.

15
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,774
Whoo!

16
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,990
Bitch!

17
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:35,122
- Bit more, bit more.
- Go on, Paul. Fish her out.

18
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:36,623
There. Got you.

19
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:38,625
- You all right?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:42,253
It's freezing. I can't feel my fingers.

21
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,589
Heave!

22
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,634
<i>Jessie, Jessie. </i>

23
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:51,386
Ah, come here. Oh, babe.

24
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:59,477
<i>It was just amazing. 
Would you like to do that?</i>

25
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:03,314
Come on, Jessie, it's freezing.
Let's go back to the car.

26
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:04,899
<i>Go with your Daddy. </i>

27
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:07,026
- I'll just help the girls.
- All right.

28
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:09,278
It's OK, you go on. We can finish up here.

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,780
You sure? Thanks, guys.
I'll see you at the hotel.

30
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:13,448
See you.

31
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:28,170
Jess, shall I phone Rachel's mum?

32
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:31,090
See if Rachel wants
to come to dinner on Thursday?

33
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:33,133
Yeah? OK.

34
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:37,262
<i>When she comes round,
she can help us plan your birthday party. </i>

35
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,515
Are you going to invite any boys this time?

36
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:47,354
Are you OK? You seem a bit distant.

37
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,898
I'm fine.

38
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,092
Jess?

39
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:13,934
Jessie!

40
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:39,874
Jessie!

41
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:44,629
Sh, sh. I'm sorry. She's gone.

42
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,381
- I'm sorry.
- No!

43
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:48,757
No, no.

44
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,009
No, no, no.

45
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,637
She's gone, Sarah. Shh.

46
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,806
Shh.

47
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:07,705
Well, it's mud, blood and beer...

48
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:10,082
or sweet Jesus.

49
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:12,209
Great. Turn that shite off.

50
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,679
That's frightening.

51
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:28,891
Listen, we don't have to do this, you know.

52
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:32,186
We can head back and stay in town.

53
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,647
Get wasted, go to a barn dance.

54
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,691
Now that is frightening.

55
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:48,159
You're right, we don't have to do this.
But I'm not going to be the one to tell Juno.

56
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:53,413
She's a piece of work, man.
She always brings us out into the middle of...

57
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:54,956
Well, look at it.

58
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:58,918
- She came to Scotland last year.
- Yeah, and left pretty quickly.

59
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:38,788
Sarah! Beth!

60
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,457
Juno.

61
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:43,584
You look fantastic.

62
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:48,130
Ah, come here. Oh.

63
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,341
Let me look at you. Wow!

64
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:52,217
Everything is going to be fine.

65
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:53,927
Better. It's going to be great.

66
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:56,721
Becca and Sam can't wait to see you.
Why don't you go in?

67
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:59,057
- Give me these.
- Yeah.

68
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:00,141
Thanks.

69
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,435
- OK?
- Yeah, OK.

70
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,356
<i>Ooh, very nice. </i>

71
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:10,234
- How is she?
- Well, she's here.

72
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,736
One step at a time, eh?

73
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,448
<i>Hey, hey, hey!
Who are you calling a fucking cheater?</i>

74
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,199
<i>I'm calling you a fucking cheater. </i>

75
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,034
<i>Hello!</i>

76
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,577
<i>Hey!</i>

77
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,955
Hello.

78
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:27,917
- You do look really good.
- Oh, you look amazing.

79
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,210
- Hey!
- Let me put the bags down.

80
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,132
Oh, so nice to see you.

81
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,843
- We're starving.
- OK, go, go.

82
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,638
- What have you got?
- Er, well, there's a bit of...

83
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,055
Sam. Sam.

84
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,683
Thank you so much for your letter.
It meant a lot to me.

85
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:48,644
Oh, Sarah, look,
I'm so sorry that I couldn't be there.

86
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,771
You know, mid-terms and...

87
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:55,233
You know, Sam is going to be Doctor Van Ney
in like a year's time.

88
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:56,318
No!

89
00:09:56,359 --> 00:10:00,530
- Please tell me it's longer than that?
- I am so proud of my little sister.

90
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:03,533
- Who wants a drink?
- Yes! Me!

91
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:06,285
- Brandy shot?
- Yeah, yeah.

92
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:08,162
- So, Beth...
- Mm-hm?

93
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:11,498
I hear it all starts falling apart past 25?

94
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,002
Is that what they teach you
at medical school, yeah? To take the piss?

95
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:18,088
- Cheeky bitch!
- Ow!

96
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:20,298
Can anyone make me feel any older?

97
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,717
<i>- Oh, here we go. 
- Hello.</i>

98
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,554
- Hi, you must be the teacher.
- Beth, Sarah, this is Holly.

99
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:28,889
Juno's protégé.

100
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:32,351
- I always thought Juno would eat her young.
- Oh, nice.

101
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:34,811
I'm well able to handle myself,
thanks very much.

102
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:38,398
I've heard about you.
You're that mentalist that jumps off buildings.

103
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,276
- Base jumping. You should try it, seriously.
- So you live in America now?

104
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:44,862
Ran out of things to jump off in Galway,
you know.

105
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:47,490
I'm always searching for the next big high.

106
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:49,825
- Sure you'd know all about that.
- Sorry?

107
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,786
Juno showed me a photo
of when you used to climb together.

108
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:56,498
I found this classic picture. Ah!

109
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,750
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

110
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:02,795
- Look at the state of us!
- Oh, my God. That's bad.

111
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:04,714
<i>Sexy!</i>

112
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,842
Love each day.

113
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:12,137
Used to be something Paul used to say.

114
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:16,641
Anyway... cheers.

115
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:19,561
Here's to our adventure.

116
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,522
- Skol.
- Cheers.

117
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,528
Come on, light, you bastard.

118
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:35,826
So, have you done Boreham Caverns before?

119
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:39,120
I saw it in a book once.
It's for tourists. It's not adventure.

120
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:42,749
Might as well have hand rails
and a fucking gift shop.

121
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,167
If you're a caver, jumper, climber...

122
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,546
...you just do it and not give a shite.

123
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:51,256
Or the thing that's bigger than you will get you.

124
00:11:57,178 --> 00:12:00,390
<i>You want adventure, Holly?
When have I ever let you down?</i>

125
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:04,185
What?

126
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:07,271
Holly, tomorrow is going to be awesome. OK?

127
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:11,859
Take this. You need it.

128
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,495
<i>What about Josh, Sam?
Are you guys still together?</i>

129
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:27,164
<i>Kind of. Sort of. </i>

130
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,500
Different... shifts.

131
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,461
Oh, my God.

132
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,007
- Oh, my Jesus!
- What do you think, eh?

133
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,178
Don't say a fucking word, all right?

134
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,971
It was a Christmas present.

135
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,645
Shut up.

136
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,649
- What about you Holly? Got a man?
- Oh...

137
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,233
I'm a sports fuck like Juno.

138
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:00,028
- What?
- Rebecca, too, I think.

139
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,867
<i>But when I'm older,
I want to have lots of babies. </i>

140
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:11,288
<i>Beth, did Sarah tell you that... </i>

141
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:59,762
Oh!

142
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,598
Wakey.

143
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,016
<i>Wakey. </i>

144
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:07,144
I feel like road kill. Give me five minutes.

145
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,063
Five minutes.

146
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:29,540
Good morning, my little ones.
Wakey, wakey.

147
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:34,544
- Good morning.
- Is that what you call it? It's fucking freezing!

148
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:36,046
Holly!

149
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:44,554
We're leaving at seven. Don't be late.

150
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,055
Try that.

151
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,683
The queen is dead.

152
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:52,811
Long live... the fucking queen.

153
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:04,155
<i>Beth, you're not driving. </i>

154
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,158
- If you drive we'll never get there.
- Paper, scissors, stone.

155
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,993
- Come on.
- Oh, you're a dick.

156
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,327
- Go on.
- OK.

157
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:13,789
- There you go.
- No, wait, babe. Best of three.

158
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,290
I'll drive. Right?

159
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:16,958
Ladies, group photo.

160
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,127
You'd better hurry it up. We're running late.

161
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:22,880
- I look like shit.
- We all look like shit. Just give me a smile.

162
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:24,674
- Hat? No hat?
- No hat.

163
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:26,175
<i>- No hat, no hat. 
- All right. </i>

164
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:29,053
- Run, run, run, run.
- Say "sausage"!

165
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:30,888
Sausage!

166
00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:02,750
- Sarah, slow down a bit.
- I'm having fun.

167
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,418
She's having fun.

168
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,212
Whoa! Turn, turn, turn there.

169
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,130
- Let's off road.
- Great.

170
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,385
You should have some water.

171
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:17,555
Trying to set this watch is impossible.
The buttons are too fucking small.

172
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:19,682
- Leave it alone.
- Why do you wear it, anyway?

173
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:23,144
- My boyfriend gave it to me, it's sentimental.
- It's fucking mental.

174
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,479
Any guy that gave that to me, I'd dump him.

175
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:30,401
<i>Juno, are you sure this is the right way?</i>

176
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:33,820
- Relax, I've never been lost in my life.
- Marvelous.

177
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,751
- So have you done these caves before?
- No.

178
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,462
But they are only level two.
Quite safe, don't worry.

179
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,965
- I wasn't.
- The only danger is that I might fall asleep.

180
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,884
Boreham Caves.
More like boredom caves.

181
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,912
- Nice parking.
- Thanks.

182
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:41,299
<i>This one time in Galway. 
When I free-climbed the cathedral,</i>

183
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:44,510
<i>a priest chased me
down the whole of the ground floor. </i>

184
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:46,887
<i>That was brilliant. </i>

185
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,474
<i>- I shouldn't have wasted the effort, though. 
Holly, shut up. </i>

186
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:52,643
Rebecca, leave her alone.

187
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:55,520
OK, guys, let's get moving. We're running late.

188
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:06,405
Come on, keep up.

189
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:11,076
Hey, Holly, wait up.
Move it, short arse.

190
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:18,375
Oi, Carter, get to the back.
Come on, you lazy bastard.

191
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:27,591
You finally caught up with me.

192
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:35,974
- Juno, are we there yet?
- There's a river about half a mile ahead.

193
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:39,185
When we reach it,
we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?

194
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:42,188
How does she know there's a river up ahead?
I can't hear a thing.

195
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,731
She can probably smell it.

196
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:46,359
She came up here last week
to check the route out.

197
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,820
<i>It's rule number one -
file a flight plan and stick to it. </i>

198
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:52,614
- And rule number two?
- Don't go wandering off.

199
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:57,410
You think it's dark when you turn out the lights.
Well, down there it's pitch black.

200
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,206
- You can get dehydration, disorientation...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,166
- ... claustrophobia...
- Blah, blah.

202
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,254
...panic attacks, paranoia, hallucinations,

203
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:10,964
visual and aural deterioration...

204
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:31,733
Hey!

205
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,903
Eurgh.

206
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:39,491
Yeah, lovely, Holly. A real Kodak moment.

207
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:42,452
- Don't touch it.
- You wouldn't want to piss it off.

208
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:45,079
- What do you think did that, Sam? A bear?

209
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,289
What is this? Nature Detectives?

210
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:51,877
- It could have been Big Foot. Come on.
- Sam, stop poking it with a fucking stick.

211
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,815
This is it.

212
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,154
- You're having a laugh!
- Afraid not.

213
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,741
I'm an English teacher,
not fucking Tomb Raider.

214
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,827
You'll be fine.

215
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:39,045
<i>OK, Sarah, Beth, you're up next. 
Sam, stay with Becca. </i>

216
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,880
<i>Do what she does and you'll be fine. </i>

217
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:44,383
Holly, safety first.
I don't want any stunts this time.

218
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:46,927
- You OK? See you down there.
- No.

219
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:51,348
<i>Make sure your cow's tail is locked
there and there. You hold on to this like that. </i>

220
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,475
Look, I have done this before, you know?

221
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:57,937
- I'm only looking after you.
- And I appreciate it, in small doses.

222
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,586
<i>You gotta see this place. </i>

223
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:25,963
It's beautiful!

224
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:29,633
<i>You won't believe this, Beth. 
- Oh, shit!</i>

225
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,343
Shit, shit, shit.

226
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,725
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

227
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:48,067
Ah, piece of piss.

228
00:22:50,778 --> 00:22:52,321
Oh, my God!

229
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:53,822
<i>It's incredible. </i>

230
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:55,365
<i> Clear!</i>

231
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,874
It's Holly.

232
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,208
Shit, move!

233
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,339
Holly, you do this safely,
in order, following my lead. OK?

234
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:14,091
Take it slow and easy.

235
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:26,060
<i>Juno. 
- Smart arse.</i>

236
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,424
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

237
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:02,218
They're gone. They're gone now. Look.

238
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:08,140
<i> One bat, two bats. </i>

239
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:09,600
50 bats.

240
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,437
Holly, fuck off.

241
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,275
Which way?

242
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:22,612
There's only one way out of this chamber
and that's down the pipe.

243
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,373
OK.

244
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:21,332
It's a drop.

245
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:28,130
OK?

246
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:33,844
Holly, chuck us your bag.

247
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,819
Oh, my God!

248
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,440
<i> Find anything good?</i>

249
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:21,567
- Jesus Christ!
- Come on, let's eat.

250
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:31,076
- Holly, would you take a break?
- I just want to take a few more shots.

251
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:33,870
This cave is a lot cooler than I thought.

252
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,375
Hey?

253
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:41,419
Not hungry.

254
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,713
Are you OK?

255
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:47,258
Juno, I won't break. I'm fine.

256
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,552
- I asked you for this.
- I know.

257
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,765
Um, Sarah?

258
00:27:56,516 --> 00:27:59,602
<i>I haven't had a chance to say that I'm... </i>

259
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,855
really sorry I didn't stay around longer
after the accident.

260
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:10,696
Anyway...

261
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:13,990
...we're all here for you now, OK?

262
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,409
Yeah.

263
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:19,496
Look, sorry. I'm feeling a bit out of it.
It's probably jet lag.

264
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:22,790
- So I'm just going to take a look around, OK?
- Yeah, OK.

265
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:25,418
Why don't you try and find us
the way through, huh?

266
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:27,711
Hey, don't go too far.

267
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,013
What's up with her?
She looks like she's seen a ghost.

268
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:39,472
She's fine.

269
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:00,158
I've found the next passage!

270
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:12,127
- That's it? It's a bit small, isn't it?
- Hey, hey, hey!

271
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,088
- I don't get this.
- What?

272
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,841
This is not how I imagined it
from reading the book.

273
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:21,427
That's why I don't trust books.
Leaves too much room for interpretation.

274
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,012
Something wrong?

275
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,347
- No.
- It's nothing.

276
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,224
<i>I'm taking point, guys. </i>

277
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:32,020
Careful. Just find the way through.
We'll wait here.

278
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:27,890
Sarah?

279
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:31,185
<i>- Shit.
- Are you still behind me?</i>

280
00:32:31,226 --> 00:32:32,644
Yes.

281
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,564
Shit!

282
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:38,066
Shit!

283
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:41,819
Sarah?
Guys, it's Sarah, I think she might be stuck.

284
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,613
<i>I am stuck!</i>

285
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,615
<i>All right, Sarah. 
Calm down, just relax. </i>

286
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:50,953
I can't fucking relax.

287
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:52,329
Fuck, fuck!

288
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:56,625
Sarah, you have to calm down and the only way
you're going to do that is to breathe.

289
00:32:56,666 --> 00:33:00,336
<i>OK, breathe slowly. Just keep breathing. </i>

290
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:05,925
I can't. I can't.

291
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:10,137
<i>- I can't fucking breathe.
- Sarah, OK, listen to me. </i>

292
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:12,097
Just listen to my voice, yeah?

293
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:16,893
Sarah, I'm coming. I'm coming back.
OK? OK.

294
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:19,896
Sarah, OK?

295
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:23,733
Listen to me, keep breathing. OK? Hey.

296
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:27,570
Hey, hey.

297
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:31,156
OK. OK. OK.

298
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:35,410
<i>- Look here at me, Sarah, hey?
- Help me. </i>

299
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:38,788
What are you so worried about, Sarah?
Look at me.

300
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,915
OK, breathe. Breathe, OK?

301
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:43,334
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

302
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:47,671
- Listen to me. What are you so afraid of?
- I can't fucking move!

303
00:33:47,713 --> 00:33:50,924
<i>You can move. Sarah, look at me, look at me.</i>

304
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:56,596
The worst thing that could have happened to
you has already happened and you're still here.

305
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:00,767
This is just a poxy cave and there's nothing left
to be afraid of, I promise.

306
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:02,643
OK? OK?

307
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:04,770
Hey. Hey, listen, listen.

308
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:08,732
Listen to me, you'll love this one.
How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

309
00:34:08,774 --> 00:34:12,736
God damn it, let me hear you say it.
How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

310
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:15,238
What do you do? You tickle its citrus.

311
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,032
OK, that's better. Come on.

312
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:20,910
OK, OK. All right, we're going to move now.
Take hold of my arm, all right?

313
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:23,704
We're going to move slowly.
That's it, grab my arm, OK?

314
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:24,997
OK, come on.

315
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,708
Just slowly. Pull on me, OK?
OK, come on.

316
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:33,505
The rope bag. I forgot the rope bag.

317
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:34,423
OK.

318
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,640
OK, fuck the rope bag. OK, move, now!

319
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,766
Now!

320
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:46,892
Hurry up!

321
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:49,853
Sarah, come on!

322
00:34:50,562 --> 00:34:52,648
Sarah, keep hold of the rope!

323
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,252
Sarah?

324
00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:16,419
Oh, ah.

325
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:18,380
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

326
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:21,299
Is everybody OK? Is everybody OK?

327
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:23,301
- Don't fucking touch me.
Rebecca?

328
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:25,720
I'm here, I'm OK.
Beth, are you injured?

329
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:27,012
No, I'm fine.

330
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:31,558
- Nobody move until the dust has settled.
- Don't worry, Juno, we're not going anywhere.

331
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:36,938
<i>You might be right about that. </i>

332
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,731
Jesus.

333
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:43,111
So what's the story now?

334
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:47,615
According to the guidebook,
this cave system has three ways out.

335
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:51,034
This is just one of them.
Isn't that right, Juno?

336
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:53,537
<i>Juno, that's right, isn't it?</i>

337
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:55,914
Check the book.

338
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,876
- I didn't bring it.
- What?

339
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:02,670
No point.

340
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:05,881
For Christ's sake, Juno.

341
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:08,425
<i>I knew it. I knew this wasn't right. </i>

342
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,930
You filed a flight plan to mountain rescue?
If we don't report in, they'll come looking for us.

343
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:17,809
That's how it's supposed to work
except I put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns

344
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:20,728
and this isn't Boreham Caverns, is it, Juno?

345
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,647
We're in the wrong fucking cave?

346
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:25,566
Holly was right.
Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap.

347
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:31,488
- Don't try and pin this fucking shite on me!
- This is not caving. This is an ego trip.

348
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,324
Rebecca,
I didn't know this was going to happen.

349
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:36,117
This is exactly what we believe in.

350
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,578
We said, if there's no risk, what's the point?

351
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,955
Don't try and justify this.

352
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:42,874
Where... Where are we?

353
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:46,419
It hasn't got a name. It's a new system.

354
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,088
I wanted us all to discover it.

355
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,882
No-one's ever been down here before.

356
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:54,593
- You're fucking kidding me.
- Oh, God!

357
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:59,556
<i>How the hell do we get out?
There may not be a way out. </i>

358
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:02,225
<i>Look, there's no going back now. </i>

359
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:05,436
We have to find a way out of this chamber
and keep pushing forward.

360
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:07,813
<i>What the fuck do you think you're doing?</i>

361
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:11,316
<i>We all trusted you. You told me
this was going to be good for Sarah. </i>

362
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:14,861
<i>Have you any idea what she's been through?</i>

363
00:37:14,903 --> 00:37:17,739
<i>No, cos you couldn't get away fast enough,
you selfish cow. </i>

364
00:37:17,781 --> 00:37:19,782
<i>You know what, Beth?</i>

365
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:23,286
We all lost something in that crash.

366
00:37:27,665 --> 00:37:29,750
Just get us out of here.

367
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:37,382
<i>Look, cave systems
sometimes break ground. It's a small chance. </i>

368
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,592
But if we stay here, we'll die.

369
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:41,636
<i>Let's go. </i>

370
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,125
<i>Wait!
- What?</i>

371
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,460
Don't move, Sam. Just don't move.

372
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:19,379
Stay right there.

373
00:38:46,737 --> 00:38:48,614
Oh, shit. No more.

374
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,627
Thanks, Beth.

375
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:05,254
Now I know how far down it is.

376
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:07,089
So, what now?

377
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:11,635
One of us has to get all the way across there
so they can rig a line for you guys.

378
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:17,891
I have three cams, I need at least three more.
Where's the other rope bag?

379
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:20,476
Where is it?

380
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,604
We lost it, when the cave collapsed.

381
00:39:24,855 --> 00:39:25,898
Sorry.

382
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,458
Help me.

383
00:40:12,649 --> 00:40:14,234
<i>Come on, Becca. </i>

384
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:38,048
- Aargh!
- You got it.

385
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:49,224
Come on, come on.

386
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:52,477
<i>Come on, Rebecca. </i>

387
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,646
<i>Come on, Rebecca. </i>

388
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:56,773
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

389
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:00,818
<i>- Fuck.
- Are you OK?</i>

390
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,695
What's wrong?

391
00:41:02,737 --> 00:41:05,489
It's nothing. I'm all right.

392
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:06,782
OK.

393
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,378
All right, more slack.

394
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:23,256
More slack, thanks.

395
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:30,054
Fuck!

396
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:40,605
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

397
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:44,859
<i>- OK.
Well done. </i>

398
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:50,406
OK.
Throw me the right rope.

399
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:55,118
OK.

400
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,121
OK.

401
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:06,087
Come on.

402
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:19,807
Yeah!

403
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:24,186
- Now, you make it look easy.
- Yeah, well, you make it look hard.

404
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:33,070
<i>- Oh.
Don't look down, Beth. Keep going. </i>

405
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:36,072
- Just keep going.
You're OK. You're safe.

406
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:42,620
Good. There you go.

407
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,712
Was this about me or you?

408
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:57,926
It's about us,
getting back to what we used to be.

409
00:42:58,968 --> 00:43:01,220
I wanted us to claim this place, name it.

410
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:04,473
I thought maybe your name.

411
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,975
Or maybe yours.

412
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:14,357
You're doing well. Come on.

413
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:16,568
Come on.

414
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:21,572
There you are. Come on, give me your hand.

415
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:37,879
Juno?

416
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:41,341
We'll need everything we've got.

417
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:44,760
<i>Haul it in. </i>

418
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,822
Fuck.

419
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,133
Yes!

420
00:44:31,094 --> 00:44:32,512
Reach.

421
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:34,181
<i>Reach out. </i>

422
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:36,016
Aargh!

423
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:38,476
Juno!

424
00:44:38,518 --> 00:44:39,561
No!

425
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:58,203
<i>Juno, it's OK, we've got you. </i>

426
00:44:58,244 --> 00:44:59,662
<i>OK, pull!</i>

427
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:05,584
Sam!
Holly, let me pass.

428
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,337
<i>Rebecca, show me your hand. </i>

429
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,186
Let go, let go.

430
00:45:25,227 --> 00:45:28,147
- What does it mean?
- It means we're not the first.

431
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:30,941
It's a piton, right?

432
00:45:30,983 --> 00:45:34,194
If cavers were here,
there's a better chance of us getting out.

433
00:45:34,236 --> 00:45:38,490
This equipment is at least 100 years old.
No-one uses stuff like this any more.

434
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:41,534
Besides, if anyone had been down here
and made it out,

435
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:43,286
they would have named it already.

436
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:46,956
<i>Becca, are you OK?</i>

437
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:48,123
I'll live.

438
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:55,005
Holly, how does it look?

439
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:57,132
<i>It's tight again, but I can get through. </i>

440
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:59,676
OK, keep going. We'll be right behind you.

441
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:14,898
Hey, there's something down here.

442
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:50,639
Guys, it's amazing,
but the batteries on our lights will run out.

443
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:54,101
<i>- So I suggest we keep moving. 
- Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

444
00:46:54,142 --> 00:46:57,645
- What is it, Beth?
- Juno, light up one of your flares.

445
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:01,149
- We don't have time for this.
- Just light a flare.

446
00:47:12,743 --> 00:47:16,830
- Really lovely, Beth, but it's fucking useless.
- No, look at it. What do you see?

447
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:18,957
<i>You've got the mountain, the cave... </i>

448
00:47:18,998 --> 00:47:21,584
and there's two entrances.

449
00:47:25,129 --> 00:47:28,424
- You are a fucking genius.
- I have my moments.

450
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:31,343
- This means there's another way out?
- Let's find out.

451
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:33,887
Come on!

452
00:47:52,946 --> 00:47:55,031
- Bastard!
- Which way?

453
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:57,158
Holly, give me your lighter.

454
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:00,745
- Come on.
- Here.

455
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:06,667
Fuck!

456
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:10,712
- Come on! Come on!
- Shit!

457
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:16,885
- That one!
- Hey! Holly!

458
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:21,097
Holly, slow down!

459
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:27,394
<i>Holly! Careful!</i>

460
00:48:28,479 --> 00:48:30,647
Daylight! I can see daylight!

461
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,611
<i>Holly! Careful! Slow down!</i>

462
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:39,489
<i>Holly, it's not daylight!</i>

463
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:47,246
- Help me!
- Hold on!

464
00:48:48,455 --> 00:48:50,624
Guys! Hold...

465
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:53,251
Holly!

466
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:02,009
Sam! Get down here!

467
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:03,302
Holly!

468
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:06,597
<i>Holly!</i>

469
00:49:20,276 --> 00:49:22,570
<i>Holly! Answer me!</i>

470
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,620
I think I hurt my leg!

471
00:49:31,662 --> 00:49:34,873
<i>Don't move! We're coming down to you. </i>

472
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:38,877
Oh, fuck!

473
00:49:43,464 --> 00:49:46,467
No! Fuck!

474
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:56,685
Someone better get down here!

475
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:09,571
- Oh, that's fucking disgusting.
- Beth! Not here, not now!

476
00:50:09,613 --> 00:50:13,200
We need help. Everybody grab a corner.
We need to move her out of the water.

477
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:17,787
Nice and easy now. And... lift!

478
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:18,913
Argh!

479
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:24,252
- You fuckers!
- Juno, find something to make a splint out of.

480
00:50:24,293 --> 00:50:27,296
- It's OK, I've got her.
- Hey, Juno, use one of the ice axes.

481
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:29,131
You'll be all right, sweetheart.

482
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:44,312
OK.

483
00:50:45,855 --> 00:50:48,482
- Sarah!
- Juno, I'm gonna need your help here.

484
00:50:48,524 --> 00:50:50,234
- Sarah!
- Juno!

485
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:53,570
Take hold of her arm.
You'll have to hold her down.

486
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:55,071
What are you gonna do?

487
00:50:55,113 --> 00:50:59,117
I need to dress the wound and rig up a splint,
but I can't while the bone is protruding.

488
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,119
I need to push it back in.

489
00:51:02,203 --> 00:51:04,914
- I hate you.
- I know.

490
00:51:04,956 --> 00:51:05,998
Do it.

491
00:51:21,095 --> 00:51:23,389
Bite down on this.

492
00:51:23,431 --> 00:51:26,225
- Keep hold of her.
- Just fucking bite down, OK?

493
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:28,352
Go!

494
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:33,523
<i>Come on!</i>

495
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:43,115
Just keep biting down, baby.

496
00:51:43,157 --> 00:51:45,284
Come on.

497
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,830
OK, someone get me a medical kit.

498
00:51:51,665 --> 00:51:54,918
OK, OK, OK. Calm down. It'll be all right.

499
00:52:31,201 --> 00:52:33,286
What are you doing?

500
00:52:33,328 --> 00:52:35,705
I just saw something ahead in the tunnel.

501
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:41,669
Sarah, I promise you,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

502
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:43,880
But I can't do it unless you're with me.

503
00:52:43,921 --> 00:52:46,006
<i>Sarah?</i>

504
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:49,009
Sarah!

505
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:52,137
Sarah, look at me.

506
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:55,015
There's nothing there.

507
00:52:59,561 --> 00:53:00,853
That's the best I can do.

508
00:53:00,895 --> 00:53:04,774
It'll hurt like hell and you can't put any weight
on it, but at least you can move.

509
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:08,777
They combed these mountains centuries ago.
Anyone trapped would be a skeleton now.

510
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,779
- That is just what it looked like.
- What?

511
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:12,948
- Sarah thinks she saw someone.
- Saw what?

512
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,534
<i>I don't think I saw someone, I saw someone.</i>

513
00:53:15,575 --> 00:53:18,328
No, you heard something
and saw what you wanted to see.

514
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:22,081
- It's the dark. It plays tricks on people.
- I can describe exactly what I saw.

515
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:25,209
- What did you see?
- A man. I saw a man.

516
00:53:25,251 --> 00:53:27,336
<i>Are you sure?
- Yes!</i>

517
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:31,048
And it's not the first time. I thought
I saw someone before, but now I'm sure.

518
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:34,885
Look, if there is somebody down here,
then maybe they can help get us out.

519
00:53:34,926 --> 00:53:37,595
Sarah, there's no-one down here.
Forget about it!

520
00:53:37,637 --> 00:53:39,931
Hey, we have to get Holly out of here.

521
00:53:39,973 --> 00:53:42,183
OK? This is all that matters right now.

522
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:46,020
- Beth!
- It's OK.

523
00:53:46,062 --> 00:53:48,147
Is it? Fuck!

524
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,275
Fuck me.

525
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:53,402
<i>You've got to keep warm. </i>

526
00:53:54,694 --> 00:53:57,655
Why are we walking away?
There was daylight back there.

527
00:53:57,697 --> 00:53:59,991
It wasn't. It was phosphorus in the rock.

528
00:54:00,033 --> 00:54:03,161
We're two miles underground,
the only light down here is ours.

529
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:06,330
Argh! Well, it looked like fucking daylight to me.

530
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:22,386
Right tunnel!

531
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:42,155
I got you. OK?

532
00:55:51,802 --> 00:55:54,930
Jesus! What is this place?

533
00:55:54,971 --> 00:55:58,058
Holly, where's the infrared button?

534
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:07,650
<i>Dead animals. </i>

535
00:56:07,691 --> 00:56:10,027
<i>Hundreds of them. </i>

536
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:11,612
This is not good, guys.

537
00:56:11,653 --> 00:56:13,739
Can we get out of here? Which way?

538
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,865
Come on.

539
00:56:18,201 --> 00:56:20,828
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?

540
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:24,999
There's no breeze. It could be
any one of these tunnels. Take your pick.

541
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:27,585
Oh, fuck it! Hello!

542
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:31,672
- Please!
- Is there anybody there?

543
00:56:31,713 --> 00:56:33,799
Hello!

544
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:43,057
It's there! It's up there!
It's there on the roof!

545
00:56:50,397 --> 00:56:53,942
Fucking hell, did you see...?
What the fuck was that?

546
00:56:53,984 --> 00:56:56,611
I don't know!
It moved so fast, I could barely see it!

547
00:56:56,653 --> 00:56:59,948
- I've never seen anyone climb like that!
- I told you I saw someone!

548
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:02,200
- That was not a human being!
- Screw this.

549
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:04,869
Let's take our chances and pick a tunnel. Move!

550
00:57:15,337 --> 00:57:17,422
What's happening?

551
00:57:17,464 --> 00:57:20,133
Oh, shit! It's circling us.

552
00:57:28,432 --> 00:57:32,185
- Where is it?
- This way! Move!

553
00:57:32,227 --> 00:57:37,148
- Holly! We've got to move. We've got to move.
- Come on! Move it!

554
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,568
<i>Come on, Holly! Move it! Let's go!</i>

555
00:57:41,903 --> 00:57:44,697
- Juno, the flare! Get rid of it!
- Fuck!

556
00:57:45,698 --> 00:57:49,284
Holly, keep moving, come on!

557
00:58:04,423 --> 00:58:06,425
Holly! Holly!

558
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:08,761
Sarah!

559
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:12,556
Holly!

560
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,444
Sarah!

561
00:58:27,945 --> 00:58:30,405
<i>Sarah! Run!</i>

562
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,619
Sarah!

563
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:49,465
Get off!

564
00:58:49,506 --> 00:58:51,425
Get away, you fucker!

565
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:26,595
<i>Don't leave me. </i>

566
01:00:50,534 --> 01:00:53,453
Oh, fuck. My battery's gone dead.

567
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:56,456
Where are they?

568
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,586
What's happened to the others?

569
01:01:01,627 --> 01:01:04,630
Becca, please say we're gonna get out of here.

570
01:01:05,923 --> 01:01:08,008
OK. OK.

571
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,135
OK.

572
01:01:14,598 --> 01:01:16,683
Go. Go!

573
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,784
<i>Mummy. Mummy. </i>

574
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,494
<i>If you're really ready... </i>

575
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:48,822
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

576
01:04:23,646 --> 01:04:25,731
Turn the light off.

577
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:33,613
Quiet.

578
01:05:06,852 --> 01:05:08,687
<i>Sarah! Sarah!</i>

579
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:11,940
Sarah!

580
01:06:27,468 --> 01:06:29,553
It can't see us.

581
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:55,076
Sam? Becca?

582
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,497
Becca!

583
01:07:00,373 --> 01:07:01,833
<i>- Becca!
- It's Juno.</i>

584
01:07:01,874 --> 01:07:03,167
<i>Becca!</i>

585
01:07:03,209 --> 01:07:07,004
The noise she's making, she'll bring
every one of those things down on her head.

586
01:07:07,046 --> 01:07:09,506
As long as it's not on mine.

587
01:07:15,804 --> 01:07:17,889
Becca!

588
01:07:21,476 --> 01:07:23,561
<i>Sam!</i>

589
01:08:17,027 --> 01:08:19,112
<i>Sam!</i>

590
01:08:21,447 --> 01:08:23,533
<i>Sam!</i>

591
01:08:25,117 --> 01:08:27,203
Anyone?

592
01:08:27,244 --> 01:08:28,746
Sam!

593
01:08:51,266 --> 01:08:53,435
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

594
01:08:54,978 --> 01:08:56,313
Oh...

595
01:08:56,354 --> 01:08:58,273
I'm sorry.

596
01:10:21,933 --> 01:10:24,018
Fuck. OK.

597
01:10:27,188 --> 01:10:28,522
OK.

598
01:10:33,318 --> 01:10:34,694
OK.

599
01:10:34,736 --> 01:10:36,821
It's all clear.

600
01:11:08,809 --> 01:11:10,310
Sam, run!

601
01:11:54,559 --> 01:11:56,645
We heard you crying for Sarah.

602
01:12:00,231 --> 01:12:01,858
Where are the others?

603
01:12:04,068 --> 01:12:06,153
They... They took Holly.

604
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,865
Beth...

605
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:13,994
Beth's dead.

606
01:12:29,299 --> 01:12:31,385
Sam...

607
01:12:32,969 --> 01:12:34,596
...what is that thing?

608
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:42,603
I don't know. Well, it does look human.

609
01:12:42,645 --> 01:12:47,066
Come on, we need to find the way out
before those things find us.

610
01:12:47,107 --> 01:12:48,651
No.

611
01:12:48,692 --> 01:12:52,070
Sam, tell us what we're fighting.

612
01:12:52,904 --> 01:12:54,614
Well...

613
01:12:55,782 --> 01:12:57,867
...they're totally blind.

614
01:12:57,909 --> 01:13:03,206
And judging from what we've seen,
I'd say they use sound to hunt with. Like a bat.

615
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:08,794
And they've evolved perfectly
to live down here in the dark.

616
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:16,301
Whatever they are,
they go to the surface to hunt.

617
01:13:16,343 --> 01:13:20,305
And they bring their food back down here to eat,
through an entrance.

618
01:13:21,514 --> 01:13:26,352
Listen, if we can stay quiet enough
and evade these fuckers...

619
01:13:27,728 --> 01:13:29,480
...I think I found the way out.

620
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:31,190
You think?

621
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:36,945
The climbing gear we found - whoever
brought that down here marked their route.

622
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:41,115
- I found those markings.
- Well, what are we waiting for?

623
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:43,201
Sarah.

624
01:13:45,494 --> 01:13:47,580
I'm not leaving without Sarah.

625
01:14:09,808 --> 01:14:11,893
Sarah!

626
01:14:13,478 --> 01:14:15,564
Oh, God.

627
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:18,191
Oh, God.

628
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:21,652
Oh, God. No.

629
01:14:22,528 --> 01:14:23,821
Sarah...

630
01:14:25,448 --> 01:14:27,157
I'm getting you out of here.

631
01:14:29,785 --> 01:14:32,162
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

632
01:14:35,123 --> 01:14:36,875
I heard Juno calling me.

633
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:40,169
I'm gonna go and find her,
and we're gonna come back and get you out.

634
01:14:40,211 --> 01:14:42,296
No, stay away from her.

635
01:14:42,338 --> 01:14:45,341
- What?
- She did this to me.

636
01:14:45,383 --> 01:14:48,302
<i>- What?
- She left me. </i>

637
01:14:48,344 --> 01:14:49,970
No, she didn't. No.

638
01:14:50,012 --> 01:14:52,097
- Shh.
- Sarah...

639
01:14:53,849 --> 01:14:55,934
Don't trust her.

640
01:14:56,935 --> 01:14:59,187
You find your own way out.

641
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:01,314
It's OK. It's all right.

642
01:15:01,355 --> 01:15:04,900
I'm not gonna leave you, Beth.
I'm not gonna leave you.

643
01:15:04,942 --> 01:15:07,027
I'm not leaving you here, OK?

644
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:09,363
Come here. Beth!

645
01:15:16,494 --> 01:15:18,580
This is Juno's.

646
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:24,251
It's from Paul.

647
01:15:26,045 --> 01:15:28,130
Oh, no.

648
01:15:38,139 --> 01:15:40,224
Sorry.

649
01:15:50,776 --> 01:15:54,112
Please... Oh, that's them. Please, come with me.

650
01:15:54,154 --> 01:15:55,864
Please.

651
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:57,490
Sarah...

652
01:15:58,575 --> 01:16:01,702
...don't leave me like this.

653
01:16:03,746 --> 01:16:06,916
No, please don't ask me to do that.

654
01:16:06,957 --> 01:16:09,585
- Please.
- I can't. I can't do that.

655
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:11,336
I can't do that.

656
01:16:11,378 --> 01:16:13,463
Please.

657
01:16:25,516 --> 01:16:27,977
OK. Ssh.

658
01:16:28,018 --> 01:16:29,645
Close your eyes.

659
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,315
Hurry! Move!

660
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:27,738
Sarah?

661
01:20:28,906 --> 01:20:30,991
Sarah?

662
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,660
Sarah?

663
01:20:33,702 --> 01:20:37,664
Look, she's dead, Juno. We can't wait for her.

664
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:39,040
Come on!

665
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:43,044
<i>Sarah!</i>

666
01:20:44,086 --> 01:20:45,963
<i>Sarah!</i>

667
01:20:55,639 --> 01:20:57,724
Sarah?

668
01:20:59,309 --> 01:21:01,394
Sarah?

669
01:21:05,689 --> 01:21:08,150
Run!

670
01:21:36,551 --> 01:21:38,636
Oh, fuck!

671
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:13,502
Fuck.

672
01:22:13,543 --> 01:22:16,755
- Come on!
- Juno, stop her! I'll be right behind you!

673
01:22:39,192 --> 01:22:42,153
Sam! What are you doing?

674
01:22:42,195 --> 01:22:43,738
<i>Come back!</i>

675
01:22:43,779 --> 01:22:45,448
Becca!

676
01:22:45,489 --> 01:22:47,533
You haven't got enough rope!

677
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:50,327
<i>Sam! Turn around!</i>

678
01:22:52,162 --> 01:22:54,498
- What are you doing? Turn around!
- Sam, baby!

679
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:58,877
<i>- Sam! Sam!
- Sam, turn around. You can come back.</i>

680
01:22:58,918 --> 01:23:02,588
<i>Please, baby, listen to me. Please!</i>

681
01:23:06,342 --> 01:23:07,134
Sam!

682
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:12,055
No!

683
01:23:13,056 --> 01:23:15,225
<i>What are you doing?</i>

684
01:23:25,443 --> 01:23:27,069
Sam!

685
01:23:33,825 --> 01:23:36,786
Sam! No!

686
01:25:51,952 --> 01:25:53,412
What happened to you?

687
01:25:57,457 --> 01:25:59,125
Rebecca?

688
01:26:05,089 --> 01:26:06,590
What about Beth?

689
01:26:10,469 --> 01:26:11,929
Didn't make it.

690
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:19,936
You saw her die?

691
01:26:32,739 --> 01:26:34,032
Come on.

692
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,337
Come on. Come on.

693
01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:45,388
<i>No! No!</i>

694
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:26,939
