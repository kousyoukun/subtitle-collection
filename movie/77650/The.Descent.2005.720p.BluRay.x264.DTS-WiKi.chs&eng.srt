好极了. 把那个他妈的关了.
Great. Turn that shite off.

听着，我们不必这么做的，这你是知道的 
Listen, we don't have to do this, you know.

62
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,586
我们可以掉头回去呆在镇上。
We can head back and stay in town.

63
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:14,044
说着废话，去那些庸俗的舞会.
Get wasted, go to a barn dance.

64
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,083
既然令人恐惧.
Now that is frightening.

65
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:26,548
你说的对，我们不必这么做。 但我不是那个告诉朱诺的人.
You're right, we don't have to do this. But l'm not going to be the one to tell Juno.

66
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:31,788

She's a piece of work, man. She always brings us out into the middle of...

好吧，看着吧
Well, look at it.

How is she?  Well, she's here.

83
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:51,047
一步一步轻轻走?
One step at a time, eh?

84
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,752
喂! 你说谁是他妈的骗子?
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i> <i>Who are you calling a fucking cheater?</i>

99
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,580
不!

Please tell me it's longer than that?  l am so proud of my little sister.

101

谁要饮料?  我要

l hear it all starts falling apart past 25?

105

ls that what they teach you at medical school, yeah? To take the piss?

106
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,337
无耻的婊子!  啊哦!

Hi, you must be the teacher.  Beth, Sarah, this is Holly.

110
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,128
朱诺 罩着的
Juno's protege.

111
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,587
我总是以为朱诺会在年轻的时候吃了她.  太好了.
l always thought Juno would eat her young.  Oh, nice.

l've heard about you. You're that mentalist that jumps off buildings.

基础跳跃.你真的应该试一下.  你现在住在美国?
Base jumping. You should try it, seriously.  So you live in America now?

115
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,085
用尽所有的 东西穿着戈尔韦粗法兰绒开始吧, 你知道的.
Ran out of things to jump off in Galway, you know.

116
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,704
我总是寻找下一个更高的目标
l'm always searching for the next big high.

117
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,044
当然这你应该知道  不好意思?
Sure you'd know all about that.  Sorry?

118
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:31,006
朱诺给我看过一张照片 是你们一起爬山时拍的
Juno showed me a photo of when you used to climb together.

119
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,711
啊，我找到这个经典的照片了!
l found this classic picture. Ah!

120

不!  不!

爱上每一天.
Love each day.

124
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:50,336
这不是保罗常说的吗？.

125
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,837
不管怎样...干杯

129
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:14,001
那么，你以前去过山洞穴吗?
So, have you done Boreham Caverns before?

130
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,296
我曾经在一本书上看到 它是旅游胜地，不是用来探险的.
l saw it in a book once. lt's for tourists. lt's not adventure.

131
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:20,920
也许还有扶手 还有他妈的礼品店.
Might as well have hand rails and a fucking gift shop.

132
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,336
如果你集洞穴工作者，攀登者，跳高者...于一身
lf you're a caver, jumper, climber...

133
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,706
你只需按部就班，就像拉泡屎一样简单
<i>..</i>you just do it and not give a shite.

134
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:29,425
除非东西比你能得到的还大.
Or the thing that's bigger than you will get you.

135
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:38,541
朱诺: 霍莉，你向往探险? 我什么时候让你失望过?
JUNO: <i>You want adventure, Holly?</i> <i>When have l ever let you down?</i>

136
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,338

137
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,416
霍丽, 明天将会很可怕吗？
Holly, tomorrow is going to be awesome. OK?

138
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:50,006
带上这个，你需要的.

139
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,626
莎啦: 萨姆， 乔希怎么样? 你们还在一起吗?

142
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:10,581

Oh, my God.

143
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,131
天啦  呃，你是怎么想的?
Oh, my Jesus!  What do you think, eh?

144
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:16,751
(Laughter)

145
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:20,294
他妈的能不能别说话?
Don't say a fucking word, all right?

146
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:22,083
它是圣诞礼物
lt was a Christmas present.

147

What?  Rebecca, too, l think.

151
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:44,958
可是当我老了 我想有一大堆的孩子.
HOLLY: <i>But when l'm older,</i> <i>l want to have lots of babies.</i>

152
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:49,377
贝丝, 莎啦是不是告诉过你...
JUNO: <i>Beth, did Sarah tell you that...</i>

153
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,873
(Birds calling)

154
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,707
(Wind chimes)

155
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,748

尽量吧
Try that.

166
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,623
皇后睡的跟死猪一样
The queen is dead.

167
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,756
长久..去他妈的皇后.

贝丝, 你不会要开车吧
JUNO: <i>Beth, you're not driving.</i>

170
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,084
你开车的话，我们永远不会到达.  ,剪刀,石头，布
lf you drive we'll never get there.  Paper, scissors, stone.

There you go.  No, wait, babe. Best of three.

我来开车，好吗？

175
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,881
女士们，集体拍照
Ladies, group photo.

176
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:57,045
你最好快一点，我们快迟到了
You'd better hurry it up. We're running late.

177
00:15:57,091 --> 00:16:00,788
我看起来糟透了  我们都是. 笑一个.
l look like shit.  We all look like shit. Just give me a smile.

178
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,583
要不要取下帽子?  .取下
Hat? No hat?  No hat.

179
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,090
取下帽子  好了.
<i>No hat, no hat.</i>  <i>All right.</i>

180
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,965
快，快，快  说‘’茄子‘’

ALL: Sausage!

182
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:40,625
莎啦 ，稍微减点速.  我正在陶醉之中.
Sarah, slow down a bit.  l'm having fun.

183
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,297
她正爽着呢.
She's having fun.

184
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:44,083
哦，转弯，就在那儿转弯! 
Whoa! Turn, turn, turn there.

185
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,005
咱们越野吧  太棒了.
Let's off road.  Great.

186
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,248
你应该喝一点水.
You should have some water.

187
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,423
调节这个表是不可能的 按钮真他妈的太小了.
Trying to set this watch is impossible. The buttons are too fucking small.

188
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,540
不要管它.  那你为什么戴着它呢?
Leave it alone.  Why do you wear it, anyway?

189
00:16:57,591 --> 00:17:01,004
我男朋友送给我的，触景生情啊.  去他妈的感情.
My boyfriend gave it to me, it's sentimental.  lt's fucking mental.

190
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,336
不管是谁送给我，我都会把它撇了
Any guy that gave that to me, l'd dump him.

191
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,254
朱诺， 你确定我们路走对了吗？
BETH: <i>Juno, are you sure this is the right way?</i>

192
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,665
放松。我从未迷过路.  了不起啊.
Relax, l've never been lost in my life.  Marvellous.

193
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,579
那么你以前有没有去过山洞穴?  没有.
So have you done these caves before?  No.

194
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,300
但是它们没什么难度 相当安全，别担心.
But they are only level two. Quite safe, don't worry.

195
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,789
我没担心什么.  唯一的危险是我可能会睡着了.
l wasn't.  The only danger is that l might fall asleep.

196
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,709
伯瑞汉姆巨洞. 更像是伯瑞敦姆巨洞 
Boreham Caves. More like boredom caves.

197
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:05,708
停的好.  多谢.
Nice parking.  Thanks.

198
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:19,087
这一次在盖耳崴，. 当我自助爬教堂时,
HOLLY: <i>This one time in Galway.</i> <i>when l freeclimbed the cathedral,</i>

199
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:22,296
神父追着我 一直到底楼.
<i>a priest chased me</i> <i>down the whole of the ground floor.</i>

200
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,664
太爽了.
<i>That was brilliant.</i>

201
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:28,247
虽然我笨不应该白费力气的 霍丽，闭嘴.
<i>l shouldn't have wasted the effort, though.</i> REBECCA: <i>Holly, shut up.</i>

202
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,420
丽贝卡, 别理她.
Rebecca, leave her alone.

203
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:33,298
姑娘们，走了. 快来不及了.
OK, guys, let's get moving. We're running late.

204
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,163
赶快，跟上.
SAM: Come on, keep up.

205
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:48,833
霍丽，等一等. 懒虫，快走.
SAM: Hey, Holly, wait up. REBECCA: Move it, short arse.

206
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:56,121
 哦，卡特，跟在后面. 赶快，你这混蛋
BETH: Oi, Carter, get to the back. HOLLY: Come on, you lazy bastard.

207
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,332
你终于赶上我了.
JUNO: You finally caught up with me.

208
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:13,713
朱诺，我们到了吗?  前面半公里处有一条小河.
Juno, are we there yet?  There's a river about half a mile ahead.

209
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:16,921
到了之后, 我们顺流而上就到了洞口,不是吗?
When we reach it, we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?

210
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:19,917
她怎么知道前面有一条小河? 我不同意.
How does she know there's a river up ahead? l can't hear a thing.

211
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,459
她是闻到的.
She can probably smell it.

212
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:24,079
他上周来这儿 探过路.
She came up here last week to check the route out.

213
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,545
这是第一原则 起草一份奋斗计划然后坚持到底.
<i>lt's rule number one</i>  <i>file a flight plan and stick to it.</i>

214
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,340
第二原则？?  不要迷路.
And rule number two?  Don't go wandering off.

215
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:35,123
你以为只有你熄灯后才会变黑呀. 下面都是漆黑的.
You think it's dark when you turn out the lights. Well, down there it's pitch black.

216
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,920
你可能会拖水，失去方向感...  好了好了.
You can get dehydration, disorientation...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:41,873

220
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,833
(Squawking)

221
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:09,413
喂
Hey!

222

223
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,165
耶，霍丽，亲爱的。真正的拍照时间到了.
Yeah, lovely, Holly. A real Kodak moment.

224
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,131
不要碰它. 你不会想滚蛋吧.
Don't touch it.  You wouldn't want to piss it off.

225
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,745
萨姆，你怎么看这个？一只熊吗？
What do you think did that, Sam? A bear?

226
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,956
这是什么？天生的侦探?
What is this? Nature Detectives?

227
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:29,546
这儿应该有大足印的. 来吧.  萨姆，不要用他妈的树枝刺它.
lt could have been Big Foot. Come on.  Sam, stop poking it with a fucking stick.

228
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,460
到了.
This is it.

229
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:58,793
你开玩笑吧!  恐怕不是.
You're having a laugh!  Afraid not.

230
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:03,377
我是英语教师, 不是盗墓的.
l'm an English teacher, not fucking Tomb Raider.

231
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,458
你会没事的 .
You'll be fine.

232
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:16,671
好了，莎拉，贝思，你们下一个上. 萨姆跟 贝卡呆在一起.
JUNO: <i>OK, Sarah, Beth, you're up next.</i> <i>Sam, stay with Becca.</i>

233
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:18,506
跟着他做，你会没事的.
<i>Do what she does and you'll be fine.</i>

234
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,997
霍丽，安全第一. 我不想这次有任何闪失.
Holly, safety first. l don't want any stunts this time.

235
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:24,547
你没事吧?下面见.
You OK? See you down there.  No.

236
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:28,964
确保你的牛皮绳绑好了  你像这样抓住它.
REBECCA: <i>Make sure your cow's tail is locked</i> <i>there and there. You hold on to this like that.</i>

237
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:31,082
看，我以前做过，你不知道吗
Look, l have done this before, you know?

238
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:35,541
我只是照顾你而已. 我感谢你，稍微.
l'm only looking after you.  And l appreciate it, in small doses.

239
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,172
你必须看看地方.
JUNO: <i>You gotta see this place.</i>

240
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,539
太美

00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:19,832
(Panting)

245
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,626
太容易了.
Ah, piece of piss.

246

霍丽，在我的带领下安全，有秩序的来，好吗？
Holly, you do this safely, in order, following my lead. OK?

252
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:51,631
放松，慢点.
Take it slow and easy.

253
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:03,585
朱诺，.  你很灵巧
HOLLY: <i>Juno.</i>  Smart arse.

254
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,580
(Screeching)

255
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:30,794
(Screams)

256
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,460

没事了.
lt's OK. lt's OK. lt's OK.

They're gone. They're gone now. Look.

259
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,627
一只蝙蝠,两只蝙蝠 ........

霍丽，滚开.
Holly, fuck off.

263
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,750
哪一条路?
Which way?

264
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,082
离开这儿只有一条路 那就是顺着绳子向下 .
There's only one way out of this chamber and that's down the pipe.

265
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,830
好了.
OK.

266
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,757
是一滴水.
JUNO: lt's a drop.

267
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:04,204
(Clattering)

268
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:05,537
什么?
JUNO: OK?

269
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,250
霍丽，打开你的包
JUNO: Holly, chuck us your bag.

270
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:15,459
(Fizzing)

271
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:30,206
天啦
SARAH: Oh, my God!  (Laughter)

272
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:04,871
(Squeaking)

273
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:31,125
(Water dripping)

274
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,747
有什么发现没?
<i>(Laughs) Find anything good?</i>

275
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,881
耶稣啊  来吧，我们吃点东西吧.
Jesus Christ!  Come on, let's eat.

276
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:08,377
霍丽，你休息一下吗?  我只想在深入下去.
Holly, would you take a break?  l just want to take a few more shots.

277
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:11,173
着山东比我想象的要冷.
This cave is a lot cooler than l thought.

278
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,663
嗨?
Hey?

279
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:18,707
我不饿.
Not hungry.

280
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:21,007
没事吧?
Are you OK?

281
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,544
朱诺，我不会半途而废的，我好得很.
Juno, l won't break. l'm fine.

282
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,832
我问你吃不吃  我知道.
l asked you for this.  l know.

283
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,040
呃，莎拉?
Um, Sarah?

284
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,881
我一直没有机会说我......
<i>l haven't had a chance to say that l'm...</i>

285
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:40,125
我没有在事故后多陪你一段时间
really sorry l didn't stay around longer after the accident.

286
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:47,963
不管怎样...
Anyway...

287
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:51,255
..现在我们全在这儿弥补，行吗?
<i>..</i>we're all here for you now, OK?

288
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,672
嗯.
Yeah.

289
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,750
我现在感觉有点力不从心. 可能是时差反映吧.
Look, sorry. l'm feeling a bit out of it. lt's probably jet lag.

290
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,046
我四处看看，好吗?  好.
So l'm just going to take a look around, OK?  Yeah, OK.

291
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:02,662
为什么不帮我们谈一下路呢?
Why don't you try and find us the way through, huh?

292
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,956
嗨，不要走太远.
Hey, don't go too far.

293
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,256
他怎么呢? 她看起来像撞见鬼了.
What's up with her? She looks like she's seen a ghost.

294
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,709
她没事
She's fine.

295
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:18,832
(Water dripping)

296
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,373
我发现新大陆了!
l've found the next passage!

297
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:49,338
就是这儿?它有点小，不是吗?  嗨，嗨!
That's it? lt's a bit small, isn't it?  Hey, hey, hey!

298
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:52,297
这不是我想要的. 什么?
l don't get this.  What?

299
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:55,043
着跟我丛书上看到 的不一样
This is not how l imagined it from reading the book.

300
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:58,622
这就是为什么我不相信书. 留下了太多的想象空间.
That's why l don't trust books. Leaves too much room for interpretation.

301
00:28:58,675 --> 00:29:00,215
有问题吗？
Something wrong?

302
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:01,537
没有.  好着呢.
No.  lt's nothing.

303
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:04,423
姑娘们，我去探路.
HOLLY: <i>l'm taking point, guys.</i>

304
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:09,213
小心。只要找到通过的路. 我们在这儿等着.
Careful. Just find the way through. We'll wait here.

305
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,373
(Splashing through water)

306
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,257
(Echoing laughter)

307
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:31,965
(Laughter)

308
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:04,913
莎拉?
Sarah?

309
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,206
妈的.  你还是跟在我后面吗？
Shit.  <i>Are you still behind me?</i>

310
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:09,667
对.
Yes.

311
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,580
妈的!
Shit!

312
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,083
妈的!
(Strains with exertion) Shit!

313
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,830
莎拉? 姑娘们，是莎拉，她可能卡住了.
Sarah? Guys, it's Sarah, l think she might be stuck.

314
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:20,625
我被卡住了!
<i>l am stuck!</i>

315
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:23,622
BETH:没事的，莎拉. 镇静，放松.
BETH: <i>All right, Sarah.</i> <i>Calm down, just relax.</i>

316
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,500
(Grunts)

317
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,955
我他妈的不能放松.
l can't fucking relax.

318
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,335
妈的
Fuck, fuck!

319
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:33,626
莎拉，你必须镇定下来， 你唯一要做的就是呼吸.
Sarah, you have to calm down and the only way you're going to do that is to breathe.

320
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:37,336
好，慢慢的呼吸，保持呼吸
<i>OK, breathe slowly. Just keep breathing.</i>

321
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:39,457
(Sarah struggles for breath)

322
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,923
我做不到.
l can't. l can't.

323
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:47,126
我他妈不能呼吸. 莎拉，听我说.
l can't fucking breathe.  <i>Sarah, OK, listen to me.</i>

324
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,082
只听我说，好吗?
Just listen to my voice, yeah?

325
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:53,871
莎拉，我来了. 好吗？ 
Sarah, l'm coming. l'm coming back. OK? OK.

326
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:56,872
莎拉，你没事吧?
Sarah, OK?

327
00:32:56,925 --> 00:33:00,705
听我的，保持呼吸 
Listen to me, keep breathing. OK? Hey.

328
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,541
喂，喂.
Hey, hey.

329
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:08,122
好了.
OK. OK. OK.

330
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:12,382
看我这儿，莎拉，好吗?  帮我.
Look here at me, Sarah, hey?  <i>Help me.</i>

331
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:15,755
傻啦，你担心什么呢? 看着我.
What are you so worried about, Sarah? Look at me.

332
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,873
呼吸，呼吸，好吗?
OK, breathe. Breathe, OK?

333
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:20,294
喂，喂，喂，听我的.
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

334
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:24,631
听我说，你怕什么呢?  我动不了!
Listen to me. What are you so afraid of?  l can't fucking move!

335
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:27,875
你可以的。莎拉，看着我.
You <i>can</i> move. Sarah, look at me, look at me.

336
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:33,546
最坏的情况已经发生了， 你不还好好的吗 
The worst thing that could have happened to you has already happened and you're still here.

337
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:37,715
我发誓,这仅仅是一个山洞 诶有什么值得害怕的
This is just a poxy cave and there's nothing left to be afraid of, l promise.

338
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:39,583
好吗？
OK? OK?

339
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,707
嗨嗨，听我说.
Hey. Hey, listen, listen.

340
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:45,668
听我说，你会喜欢这个的. 您怎么给柠檬性交高潮?
Listen to me, you'll love this one. How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

341
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:49,662
妈的，让我听你重复它 您怎么给柠檬性交高潮?
God damn it, let me hear you say it. How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

342
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:52,169
你作什么呢? 你您发痒它的柑橘. 
What do you do? You tickle its citrus. (Laughs)

343
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:53,958
好点了吗？. 来.
OK, that's better. Come on.

344
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:57,836
好，我们要走了. 抓住我的胳膊好吗?
OK, OK. All right, we're going to move now. Take hold of my arm, all right?

345
00:33:57,883 --> 00:34:00,632
我们将会缓慢的移动. 就这样，拽住我胳膊?
We're going to move slowly. That's it, grab my arm, OK?

346
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:01,918
好，来吧.
OK, come on.

347
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:04,633
慢慢的，拽住我? 好了，走.
Just slowly. Pull on me, OK? OK, come on.

348
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:10,422
包. 我忘了装绳子的包.
The rope bag. l forgot the rope bag.

349
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,331
好.
OK.

350
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,455
(Rumbling and crashing)

351
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:21,539
去他妈的包, 现在就走
OK, fuck the rope bag. OK, move, now!

352
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,669
立刻!
Now!

353
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:23,794
赶快!
Hurry up!

354
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:26,755
莎拉，快点!
Sarah, come on!

355
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,540
莎拉, 拽住绳子!
Sarah, keep hold of the rope!

356
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,707
(Muffled coughing)

357
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:52,131
莎拉?
(Coughing) BETH: Sarah?

358
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,288
恩.
Oh, ah.

359
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,248
你没事吧?  我很好.
Are you OK?  l'm all right.

360
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,167
所有人都好吧
JUNO: ls everybody OK? ls everybody OK?

361
00:34:58,216 --> 00:35:00,171
他妈的别碰我. 丽贝卡?
Don't fucking touch me. SAM: Rebecca?

362
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:02,586
REBECCA: 我在这儿,我没事. 贝斯,你受伤了吗?
REBECCA: l'm here, l'm OK. Beth, are you injured?

363
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,877
没有,我很好.
No, l'm fine.

364
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:08,416
在坍塌结束前不要轻举妄动.  别担心,朱诺,我们哪儿也不去.
Nobody move until the dust has settled.  Don't worry, Juno, we're not going anywhere.

365
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:10,622
(Coughing)

366
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:13,796
你可能是对的.
HOLLY: <i>You might be right about that.</i>

367
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:15,583
 耶稣啊.
REBECCA: Jesus.

368
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,957
现在怎么办?
HOLLY: So what's the story now?

369
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,461
REBECCA:根据导游书来说, 这个洞有三条出口.
REBECCA: According to the guidebook, this cave system has three ways out.

370
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:27,873
这仅仅是一条. 朱诺,是这样的吗?
This is just one of them. lsn't that right, Juno?

371
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:30,375
朱诺,是这样的,不是吗?
<i>Juno, that's right, isn't it?</i>

372
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,757
查书.
Check the book.

373
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,707
我没带.  什么?
l didn't bring it.  What?

374
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:39,501
N0 p0int.
No point.

375
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:42,712
朱诺,看在上帝的份上.
For Christ's sake, Juno.

376
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:45,246
我知道.我知道这不对.
<i>l knew it. l knew this wasn't right.</i>

377
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,756
你不是起草了山区救援计划吗？ 如果受不到我们的回话的话，他们回过来救我们.
You filed a flight plan to mountain rescue? lf we don't report in, they'll come looking for us.

378
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,622
这就是它应该起的作用 除非我提出一个伯瑞汉姆巨洞的奋斗计划
That's how it's supposed to work except l put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns

379
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:57,542
朱诺，这不是伯瑞汉姆巨洞，是吗？
and this isn't Boreham Caverns, is it, Juno?

380
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:59,463
我们他妈的走错山洞了?
We're in the wrong fucking cave?

381
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:02,376
霍丽是对的. 伯瑞汉姆巨洞是一个打着旅游旗号的陷阱。
Holly was right. Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap.

382
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:08,291
不要血口喷人!  这不是探险. 这是一次自私的旅行.
Don't try and pin this fucking shite on me!  This is not caving. This is an ego trip.

383
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:11,126
丽贝卡, 我不知道会搞成这样.
JUNO: Rebecca, l didn't know this was going to happen.

384
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:12,916
这就是我们坚信的.
This is exactly what we believe in.

385
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,371
我们说过，, 如果没有一点风险, 有什么意思?
We said, if there's no risk, what's the point?

386
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,747
不要试着证明这是对的.
Don't try and justify this.

387
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,671
我们在哪儿？
Where... Where are we?

388
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:23,215
他还没有名字. 这是一个新大陆.
lt hasn't got a name. lt's a new system.

389
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:25,877
我希望我们所有人都来探索.
l wanted us all to discover it.

390
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:28,673
从未有人下来过.
Noone's ever been down here before.

391
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:31,383
你他妈在欺骗我.  天啦
You're fucking kidding me.  Oh, God!

392
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:36,332
 我们怎么才能离开这儿?  可能没有出路了.
BETH: <i>How the hell do we get out?</i> HOLLY: <i>There may not be a way out.</i>

393
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:39,002
 看来我们不能原路返回了.
JUNO: <i>Look, there's no going back now.</i>

394
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,213
我们的着一条路出去 要抓紧时间.
We have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward.

395
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:44,581
BETH: 你他妈以为你再做什么?
BETH: <i>What the fuck do you think you're doing?</i>

396
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:48,081
我们全都相信你.  你说这会对莎拉有很大帮助的.
<i>We all trusted you. You told me</i> <i>this was going to be good for Sarah.</i>

397
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:51,627
你知道她经历了什么吗?
<i>Have you any idea what she's been through?</i>

398
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:54,507
不, 因为你不能足够快地离开, 你这个自私鬼.
<i>No, cos you couldn't get away fast enough,</i> <i>you selfish cow.</i>

399
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,540
 贝丝,你知道什么呀?
JUNO: <i>You know what, Beth?</i>

400
00:36:56,591 --> 00:37:00,039
在坍塌中我们都有损失.
We all lost something in that crash.

401
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:06,498
带我们离开这儿.
Just get us out of here.

402
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:14,128
山洞有时会坍塌. 不过概率很低.
JUNO: <i>Look, cave systems</i> <i>sometimes break ground. lt's a small chance.</i>

403
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:16,331
但是如果我们带在这儿,我们都会完蛋.
But if we stay here, we'll die.

404
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:18,373
走吧.
<i>Let's go.</i>

405
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:24,082
(Falling rubble)

406
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,840
等一下!  怎么了?
JUNO: <i>Wait!</i>  What?

407
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:54,169
萨姆,不要动. 不要动.
Don't move, Sam. Just don't move.

408
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:56,088
呆在那儿.
Stay right there.

409
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:25,296
妈的. 没路了.
Oh, shit. No more.

410
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:39,287
(Falling stone)  Thanks, Beth.

411
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:41,912
现在我知道有多深了.
Now l know how far down it is.

412
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,756
那么,现在怎么办?
So, what now?

413
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,291
我们中的一个人得到对面 那样的话她可以为你们加一条绳子.
One of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys.

414
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:54,547
我有三个凸轮, 我至少还要三个. 其它的绳包那儿去了?
l have three cams, l need at least three more. Where's the other rope bag?

415
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,126
哪儿去了?
Where is it?

416
00:38:58,175 --> 00:39:00,248
山东坍塌的时候,我们弄丢了.
We lost it, when the cave collapsed.

417
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:02,538
对不起.
Sorry.

418
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,090
帮我一下.
Help me.

419
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,082
(Shallow breathing)

420
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,790
(Grunting)

421
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:50,834
贝卡,快点.
<i>Come on, Becca.</i>

422
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:02,461
(Grunting)

423
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,630
Aargh!  You got it.

424
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:25,798
赶快.
Come on, come on.

425
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,038
丽贝卡,赶快.
JUNO: <i>Come on, Rebecca.</i>

426
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:31,212
丽贝卡,赶快.
<i>Come on, Rebecca.</i>

427
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:33,332
你还等什么呢?
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

428
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:37,382
妈的.  你没事吧?
Fuck.  <i>Are you OK?</i>

429
00:40:37,425 --> 00:40:39,250
出什么问题了?
What's wrong?

430
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,048
没事,我好着呢.
lt's nothing. l'm all right.

431
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,335
好.
OK.

432
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:50,333
(Gasps in frustration)

433
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,458
(Gasps)

434
00:40:54,508 --> 00:40:56,913
好了, 松一点绳子.
(Breathless) All right, more slack.

435
00:40:58,341 --> 00:40:59,798
松一点绳子,谢谢.
More slack, thanks.

436
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:03,957
(Gasps)

437
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,580
妈的!
Fuck!

438
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,752
(Panting)

439
00:41:14,883 --> 00:41:17,122
妈的
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

440
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,373
好了. 干得好.
OK. JUNO: <i>Well done.</i>

441
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:26,916
好了. 把绳子的另一头扔给我.
(Breathless) OK. Throw me the right rope.

442
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:31,621
好.
OK.

443
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,621
好.
OK.

444
00:41:41,383 --> 00:41:42,580
快.
Come on.

445
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,287
耶!
Yeah!

446
00:41:56,341 --> 00:42:00,666
你让它看起来容易.  嗯,你让它看起来困难
Now, you make it look easy.  Yeah, well, you make it look hard.

447
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:09,541
哦. Beth,不要往下看.一直走.
Oh. JUNO: <i>Don't look down, Beth. Keep going.</i>

448
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,542
一直走. 你没事的,你很安全
Just keep going. REBECCA: You're OK. You're safe.

449
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:19,090
好. 你到了.
Good. There you go.

450
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,165
这是关于我还是你?
Was this about me or you?

451
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:34,379
我们, 回到我们过去的样子.
lt's about us, getting back to what we used to be.

452
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:37,664
我希望我们证实这个地方,并给它命名.
l wanted us to claim this place, name it.

453
00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:40,913
我想可能是你的名字.
l thought maybe your name.

454
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:42,423
或者是我们的.
Or maybe yours.

455
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:50,790
你做得不错,赶快.
REBECCA: You're doing well. Come on.

456
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,007
赶快.
Come on.

457
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:58,002
你到了. 来吧,把手给我.
There you are. Come on, give me your hand.

458
00:42:59,341 --> 00:43:01,415
(Grunting)

459
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,006
(Unhooks cam)

460
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,288
朱诺?
Juno?

461
00:43:15,383 --> 00:43:17,753
我们的所有东西都派得上用场.
We'll need everything we've got.

462
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:21,165
拉紧.
<i>Haul it in.</i>

463
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:43,205
妈的.
Fuck.

464
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:48,663
(Grunts)

465
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:03,496
好!
Yes!

466
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:07,413
(Grunts)

467
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:08,876
伸出手.
Reach.

468
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:10,547
伸出手
<i>Reach out.</i>

469
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:12,379
Aargh!

470
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:14,834
朱诺!
Juno!

471
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:15,913
不
No!

472
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:28,418
(Screams)

473
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,539
朱诺,没事的,我们会拉住你的.
BETH: <i>Juno, it's OK, we've got you.</i>

474
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,001
好了,拉!
<i>OK, pull!</i>

475
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,123
(Grunting)

476
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:41,919
萨姆! 霍丽, 让我来.
BETH: Sam! SAM: Holly, let me pass.

477
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:44,672
丽贝卡, 把手给我们检查一下.
SAM: <i>Rebecca, show me your hand.</i>

478
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:52,498
(Groaning)

479
00:44:59,925 --> 00:45:01,501
我们走.
Let go, let go.

480
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,464
这是什么意思?  我们不是第一批到这儿的人.
What does it mean?  lt means we're not the first.

481
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,254
这是岩钉,对吗?
lt's a piton, right?

482
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,500
如果他们还在这儿的话, 我们会有更大的机会出去.
lf cavers were here, there's a better chance of us getting out.

483
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,792
这件装备至少也有100年的历史. 没有人会再用这样的东西了.
This equipment is at least 1 00 years old. Noone uses stuff like this any more.

484
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:17,839
而且, 如果有人曾经下来过 并且成功出去了,
Besides, if anyone had been down here and made it out,

485
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,589
这个山洞就应该有名字了.
they would have named it already.

486
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,663
(Groaning)

487
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:23,252
贝卡, 你还好吗?
JUNO: <i>Becca, are you OK?</i>

488
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,413
死不了.
l'll live.

489
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:31,294
霍丽, 看起来怎么样?
Holly, how does it look?

490
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:33,415
又变窄了, 不过我还能过.
<i>lt's tight again, but l can get through.</i>

491
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:35,955
好,继续走. 我们马上就跟上来了.
OK, keep going. We'll be right behind you.

492
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:51,165
下面有些东西.
HOLLY: Hey, there's something down here.

493
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:26,877
姑娘们,太令人惊奇了 可是我们手电的电池快没电了.
Guys, it's amazing, but the batteries on our lights will run out.

494
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:30,337
我建议我们一直走.  等一下.
<i>So l suggest we keep moving.</i>  Wait a minute. Wait.

495
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:33,879
贝丝,怎么了?  朱诺,点一根你的火焰棒.
What is it, Beth?  Juno, light up one of your flares.

496
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:37,372
我们没时间耗在这儿.  点一根你的火焰棒.
We don't have time for this.  Just light a flare.

497
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:53,042
贝丝,真的可爱, 可他妈的没用嘛.  不,看着它,你看到什么了?
Really lovely, Beth, but it's fucking useless.  No, look at it. What do you see?

498
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:55,165
你会看到山, 山洞 ...
<i>You've got the mountain, the cave...</i>

499
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:57,787
有两个出口.
and there's two entrances.

500
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:04,623
你真是他妈的天才.  老虎总有发威的时候.
You are a fucking genius.  l have my moments.

501
00:47:04,675 --> 00:47:07,542
这说明还有一条出去的路?  让我们找出来吧.
This means there's another way out?  Let's find out.

502
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:10,085
赶快!
Come on!

503
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:31,207
婊子养的!  走哪一条路?
Bastard!  Which way?

504
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:33,332
霍丽,把你的打火机给我.
Holly, give me your lighter.

505
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:36,922
快.  给.
Come on.  Here.

506
00:47:41,675 --> 00:47:42,836
妈的!
Fuck!

507
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:46,876
快  狗屎!
Come on! Come on!  Shit!

508
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:53,042
这条路!  喂,霍丽!
That one!  Hey! Holly!

509
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:57,247
,霍丽,慢一点!
Holly, slow down!

510
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:03,539
小心,霍丽
JUNO: <i>Holly! Careful!</i>

511
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,789
太阳光,我看到太阳光了! 
HOLLY: Daylight! l can see daylight!

512
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,751
霍丽,小心,慢点
<i>Holly! Careful! Slow down!</i>

513
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,632
霍丽,这不是太阳光
<i>Holly, it's not daylight!</i>

514
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:23,370
救命!  稳住!
Help me!  Hold on!

515
00:48:24,591 --> 00:48:26,747
活计,拽住 ...
Guys! Hold...

516
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:29,373
霍丽!
Holly!

517
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:38,129
萨姆,到着下面来
Sam! Get down here!

518
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:39,418
霍丽!
Holly!

519
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:42,708
霍丽!
<i>Holly!</i>

520
00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:58,669
霍丽! 回答我!
<i>Holly! Answer me!</i>

521
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:07,715
开来我腿受伤了!
l think l hurt my leg!

522
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:10,958
不要动!我们下来救你来了.
<i>Don't move! We're coming down to you.</i>

523
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,957
哦,妈的
Oh, fuck!

524
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,547
不,妈的
(Screams) No! Fuck!

525
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:26,710
(Groans)

526
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:32,746
最好有人下来!
Someone better get down here!

527
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,630
真他妈恶心.  贝丝,不是现在,不是这儿!
Oh, that's fucking disgusting.  Beth! Not here, not now!

528
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:49,254
我们得帮忙.每人抓住一角. 我们得把她从水中移走.
We need help. Everybody grab a corner. We need to move her out of the water.

529
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:53,838
好了,轻轻的. 抬!
Nice and easy now. And...lift!

530
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:54,961
Argh!

531
00:49:57,133 --> 00:50:00,296
你混蛋!  朱诺,去找些东西制作一个夹板.
You fuckers!  Juno, find something to make a splint out of.

532
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:03,339
好了,我抓住她了.  朱诺,利用一个轴
lt's OK, l've got her.  Hey, Juno, use one of the ice axes.

533
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:05,172
你会好起来的,甜心.
SAM: You'll be all right, sweetheart.

534
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,623
(Child laughs)

535
00:50:18,258 --> 00:50:20,332
好了.
OK.

536
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:24,502
莎拉!  朱诺,沃需要你在这儿帮忙.
Sarah!  Juno, l'm gonna need your help here.

537
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,256
莎拉!  朱诺!
Sarah!  Juno!

538
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,580
抓住她的胳膊. 呆会儿你得按住她.
Take hold of her arm. You'll have to hold her down.

539
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:31,090
你要干什么?
What are you gonna do?

540
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:35,127
我得给你包扎伤口,固定上夹板 但在骨头突出的时候没法做.
l need to dress the wound and rig up a splint, but l can't while the bone is protruding.

541
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:37,130
我得把骨头压回去.
l need to push it back in.

542
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:40,918
恨死你了.  我知道.
l hate you.  l know.

543
00:50:40,966 --> 00:50:41,996
作吧.
Do it.

544
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:59,378
咬住这个.
Bite down on this.

545
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:02,209
压住她.  他妈的咬住别放,好吗?
Keep hold of her.  Just fucking bite down, OK?

546
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:04,332
开始!
Go!  (Screams)

547
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:09,506
来吧!
<i>Come on!</i>

548
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,623
(Holly screams in distance)

549
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:19,081
宝贝,咬住了.
Just keep biting down, baby.

550
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:21,254
来吧.
Come on.

551
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:25,793
什么人递给我一个急救包.
OK, someone get me a medical kit.

552
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:30,880
好了.冷静.会好起来的
OK, OK, OK. Calm down. lt'll be all right.

553
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,212
(Gasps)

554
00:51:55,383 --> 00:51:56,710
(Panting)

555
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:09,207
(Gasps)  What are you doing?

556
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:11,628
我看到隧道前面有一些东西.
l just saw something ahead in the tunnel.

557
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:17,589
沙拉,我对你发誓, 我要带你离开这儿.
Sarah, l promise you, l'm gonna get you out of here.

558
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,789
可是你不配合的话我就无能为力了.
But l can't do it unless you're with me.

559
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:21,915
莎拉?
<i>Sarah?</i>

560
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:24,921
莎拉!
Sarah!

561
00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:28,040
莎拉,看着我.
Sarah, look at me.

562
00:52:28,841 --> 00:52:30,915
这儿什么也没有.
There's nothing there.

563
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:36,745
这是我能做得最好的啦.
That's the best l can do.

564
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,663
它将会像地狱般的疼痛 而且你不能压伤口  可至少你可以走了.
lt'll hurt like hell and you can't put any weight on it, but at least you can move.

565
00:52:40,716 --> 00:52:44,662
他们几个世纪前就来过了. 捆在这儿的人都会变成骨架.
They combed these mountains centuries ago. Anyone trapped would be a skeleton now.

566
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:46,671
这只是看起来而已.  什么?
That is just what it looked like.  What?

567
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:48,837
莎拉以为她看到一个人了.  S看到什么?
Sarah thinks she saw someone.  Saw what?

568
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:51,418
不是以为, 我确实看到了一个人.
l don't <i>think</i> l saw someone, l saw someone.

569
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:54,215
不是这样的, 你听到了怪声 然后在心理作用下"看到了".
No, you heard something and saw what you wanted to see.

570
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:57,955
现在很黑. 使人产生幻觉.  我可以确切地描述我所看到的.
lt's the dark. lt plays tricks on people.  l can describe exactly what l saw.

571
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,089
你看到什么了?  一个人,我看到一个人.
What did you see?  A man. l saw a man.

572
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:03,207
你确定?  如假包换!
REBECCA: <i>Are you sure?</i>  Yes!

573
00:53:03,258 --> 00:53:06,919
而且这不是第一次了.  我认为我以前看到过, 但是现在我确定了.
And it's not the first time. l thought l saw someone before, but now l'm sure.

574
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:10,746
如果有人在这儿的话, 可能会帮助我们出去
Look, if there is somebody down here, then maybe they can help get us out.

575
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,466
沙拉,这儿没人. 忘了它吧!
Sarah, there's noone down here. Forget about it!

576
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:15,794
我们得把霍丽从这儿移走.
Hey, we have to get Holly out of here.

577
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:18,045
好不好? 这是我们的当务之急.
OK? This is all that matters right now.

578
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:21,883
贝丝!  没事了.
Beth!  lt's OK.

579
00:53:21,925 --> 00:53:23,998
是吗!妈的
ls it? Fuck!

580
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,127
妈的.
Fuck me.

581
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:29,248
你得保持体温.
SAM: <i>You've got to keep warm.</i>

582
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,501
为什么走开了? 太阳光在那儿.
BETH: Why are we walking away? There was daylight back there.

583
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,836
 这不是太阳光. 它是岩石里的磷发出的光.
JUNO: lt wasn't. lt was phosphorus in the rock.

584
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:39,000
我们在地表的两公里以下, 这儿唯一的光是我们发出来的.
We're two miles underground, the only light down here is ours.

585
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,166
看起来阳光就他妈在我眼前
HOLLY: Argh! Well, it looked like fucking daylight to me.

586
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,209
走对了!
Right tunnel!

587
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:17,960
我扶着你,好吗?
l got you. OK? (Holly moans)

588
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,790
(Groans in pain)

589
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,666
耶稣啊! 这是什么地方?
BETH: Jesus! What is this place?

590
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:33,797
霍丽, 红外线开关在哪儿??
Holly, where's the infrared button?

591
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:43,376
动物尸体.
SARAH: <i>Dead animals.</i>

592
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:45,747
成百上千.
<i>Hundreds of them.</i>

593
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,340
姑娘们,这可不是什么好兆头.
BETH: This is not good, guys.

594
00:55:47,383 --> 00:55:49,457
我们能从这儿出去吗?走哪条路?
REBECCA: Can we get out of here? Which way?

595
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:51,582
快点.
Come on.

596
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:56,543
我不知道.  你不知道?这是什么意思?
l don't know. BETH: What do you mean, you don't know?

597
00:55:56,591 --> 00:56:00,715
一点风也没有.  任何一条隧道都有可能是, 选一个吧.
There's no breeze. lt could be any one of these tunnels. Take your pick.

598
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:03,293
妈的,喂!
Oh, fuck it! Hello!

599
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:07,382
不要这样!  有人在吗?
Please!  ls there anybody there?

600
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:09,498
喂!
Hello!

601
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,663
(Screams)

602
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:18,755
在那儿! 在上面! 在墙壁上面!
JUNO: lt's there! lt's up there! lt's there on the roof!

603
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,622
他妈的地狱, 你看到...? 那他妈是什么?
Fucking hell, did you see...? What the fuck was that?

604
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:32,293
不知道! 他移动的很快,我很难看清它!
l don't know! lt moved so fast, l could barely see it!

605
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:35,623
我从未看到有人想他那样爬!  我早就告诉你我看到个人了!
l've never seen anyone climb like that!  l told you l saw someone!

606
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:37,879
这不是人!  够了.
That was not a human being!  Screw this.

607
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:40,543
咱们挑一条路碰碰运气吧. 走!
Let's take our chances and pick a tunnel. Move!

608
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:43,707
(Screeching)

609
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:53,082
发生什么事了?
What's happening?

610
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:55,800
妈的! 他把我们包围了.
Oh, shit! lt's circling us.

611
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,836
它在哪儿?  这条路!快!
Where is it?  This way! Move!

612
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:12,789
霍丽,我们得走了.  快,走!
Holly! We've got to move. We've got to move.  Come on! Move it!

613
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:16,207
 霍丽,快点! 走了,快
JUNO: <i>Come on, Holly! Move it! Let's go!</i>

614
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,334
朱诺,火焰棒! 仍了它!  妈的!
Juno, the flare! Get rid of it!  Fuck!

615
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,920
霍丽, 一直走,快 !
JUNO: Holly, keep moving, come on! (Holly groans)

616
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,040

(Whimpers)

628
01:00:00,175 --> 01:00:02,082
不要抛下我.
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

629
01:00:26,008 --> 01:00:28,922
妈的,我的电池没电了.
Oh, fuck. My battery's gone dead.

630
01:00:30,466 --> 01:00:31,923
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?

631
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:37,040
其他人出什么事了?
What's happened to the others?

632
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:40,089
贝卡请告诉我我们将要离开这个鬼地方.
Becca, please say we're gonna get out of here.

633
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:43,457

Oh, fuck. Fuck.

643

Turn the light off.

她正在发出的声音会把 这儿的每一只这种东西吸引到她头上去.
The noise she's making, she'll bring every one of those things down on her head.

01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:31,498
我们听到你为莎拉哭泣.
We heard you crying for Sarah.

678
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,714
其他人在哪儿?
Where are the others?

679
01:11:38,925 --> 01:11:40,998
他们... 他们带走了霍丽.
They... They took Holly.

680
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:44,707
贝丝...
Beth...

681
01:11:47,216 --> 01:11:48,839
Beth已经死了.
Beth's dead.

682
01:11:58,883 --> 01:12:00,957
(Juno sobs)

683
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:06,207
萨姆...
Sam...

684
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,422
..这是什么东西?
<i>..</i>what is that thing?

685
01:12:14,425 --> 01:12:17,422
我不知道.不过，他们确实像人.
l don't know. Well, it does look human.

686
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:21,875
赶快，我们得在这些东西找到我们之前 找到路出去.
Come on, we need to find the way out before those things find us.

687
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:23,465
不.
No.

688
01:12:23,508 --> 01:12:26,873
萨姆 ，告诉我们怎么跟他斗.
Sam, tell us what we're fighting.

689
01:12:27,716 --> 01:12:29,422
恩..
Well...

690
01:12:30,591 --> 01:12:32,665
..他们完全瞎了.
<i>..</i>they're totally blind.

691
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:38,002
从我们已经看到的来推断, 我认为他们用声音来捕猎. 就像蝙蝠一样.
And judging from what we've seen, l'd say they use sound to hunt with. Like a bat.

692
01:12:40,508 --> 01:12:43,589
他们已经进化到 非常适应生活在漆黑的这儿.
And they've evolved perfectly to live down here in the dark.

693
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:51,081
不管他们是什么, 他们到地面捕捉猎物.
Whatever they are, they go to the surface to hunt.

694
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:55,079
他们把猎物带到这儿来吃, 通过一个入口.
And they bring their food back down here to eat, through an entrance.

695
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:01,122
听着，如果我们足够安静 并且躲过这些笨蛋...
Listen, if we can stay quiet enough and evade these fuckers...

696
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,250
..我想我找到出去的方法了.
<i>..</i>l think l found the way out.

697
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,958
你怎么看?
You think?

698
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:11,708
我们已经发现了一些攀登齿轮， 不管是谁带下来的 ，给我们标出了路.
The climbing gear we found  whoever brought that down here marked their route.

699
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:15,875
我找到这些标记了  那我们还等什么呢?
l found those markings.  Well, what are we waiting for?

700
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,962
莎拉
Sarah.

701
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:22,332
找不到莎拉，我不会走.
l'm not leaving without Sarah.

702
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,623
莎拉!
(Gasps) Sarah!

703
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:50,290
天啦.
Oh, God.

704
01:13:51,175 --> 01:13:52,916

705
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,373
天啦  不.
Oh, God. No.

706
01:13:57,258 --> 01:13:58,537
莎拉...
Sarah...

707
01:14:00,175 --> 01:14:01,881
我会带你出去.
l'm getting you out of here.

708
01:14:01,925 --> 01:14:03,583
(Groans in agony)

709
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,878
不要碰我. 不要碰我.
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

710
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:11,583
我听到朱诺叫我.
l heard Juno calling me.

711
01:14:11,633 --> 01:14:14,880
我去找她, 然后我们回来救你.
l'm gonna go and find her, and we're gonna come back and get you out.

712
01:14:14,925 --> 01:14:16,998
不，离她远一点.
No, stay away from her.

713
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:20,047
什么?  我变成这样都是她害的.
What?  She did this to me.

714
01:14:20,091 --> 01:14:23,006
什么?  她遗弃了我.
What?  <i>She left me.</i>

715
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,672
不是, 他不会这样的. 不是.
No, she didn't. No.

716
01:14:24,716 --> 01:14:26,790
莎拉 莎拉...
Shh.  Sarah...

717
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:28,500
(Gurgles)

718
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:30,623
不要相信她.
Don't trust her.

719
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,872
你自己找出路吧.
You find your own way out.

720
01:14:33,925 --> 01:14:35,998
没事了
lt's OK. lt's all right.

721
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:39,581

我不会把你抛在这儿不管的

723
01:14:41,758 --> 01:14:44,044
贝丝，到这儿来
Come here. Beth!

724
01:14:51,175 --> 01:14:53,248
这是朱诺的.
This is Juno's.

725
01:14:56,841 --> 01:14:58,915
这是从保罗那儿来的
