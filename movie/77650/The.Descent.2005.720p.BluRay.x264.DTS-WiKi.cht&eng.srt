Are you going to invite any boys this time?  (Laughs)

(Music changes to gospel)  Well, it's mud, blood and beer...

58
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,497
或者 敬愛的耶穌.
or sweet Jesus.

59
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,623
好極了. 把那個他媽的關了.
Great. Turn that shite off.

60
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,082
這令人恐懼
That's frightening.

61
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:07,291
聽著，我們不必這麼做的，這你是知道的 
Listen, we don't have to do this, you know.

62
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,586
我們可以掉頭回去呆在鎮上。
We can head back and stay in town.

63
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:14,044
說著廢話，去那些庸俗的舞會.
Get wasted, go to a barn dance.

64
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,083
既然令人恐懼.
Now that is frightening.

65
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:26,548
你說的對，我們不必這麼做。 但我不是那個告訴朱諾的人.
You're right, we don't have to do this. But l'm not going to be the one to tell Juno.

66
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:31,788
他有一份工作，男人. 她總是把我們帶到中央...
She's a piece of work, man. She always brings us out into the middle of...

67
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:33,334
好吧，看著吧
Well, look at it.

68
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:37,293
她去年來蘇格蘭。  是的，來去匆匆.
She came to Scotland last year.  Yeah, and left pretty quickly.

69
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:14,371
哦 
(Whoops)

00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,130
莎啦! 貝思!
Sarah! Beth!

71
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,797

讓我好好看看你. 哇!
Let me look at you. Wow!

75
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,541
一切都會好起來的.
Everything is going to be fine.

會更好. 
Better. lt's going to be great.

77
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,048
貝卡和 薩姆急切的想見你. 你為什麼不呢?
Becca and Sam can't wait to see you. Why don't you go in?

78
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:37,378
我來提.  好.
Give me these.  Yeah.

79

81
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,672
哦，非常好
<i>Ooh, very nice.</i>

82
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:48,548
她怎麼樣?  她就在這兒.
How is she?  Well, she's here.

83
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:51,047
一步一步輕輕走?
One step at a time, eh?

84
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,752
喂! 你說誰是他媽的騙子?
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i> <i>Who are you calling a fucking cheater?</i>

85
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,506
說你呢！
<i>l'm calling you a fucking cheater.</i>

86
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,339

Hey!  我先把包放下.
Hey!  Let me put the bags down.

91

見到你真高興.

Oh, Sarah, look, l'm so sorry that l couldn't be there.

97
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,040
你知道的，期中..
You know, midterms and...

98
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:33,500
你知道的, 薩姆差不多一年之後 就會 跟文萊博士一樣
You know, Sam is going to be Doctor Van Ney in like a year's time.

99
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,580
不!
No!

100
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:38,792
告訴我會比這個時間長?  我對我的小妹很有信心.
Please tell me it's longer than that?  l am so proud of my little sister.

101
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:41,792
誰要飲料?  我要
Who wants a drink?  Yes! Me!

102
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:44,543
白蘭地?  好啊.

103
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:46,416
那麼, 貝絲你呢...  什麼?
So, Beth...  Mmhm?

104
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,748
我聽到有超過25的酒全部分解了?
l hear it all starts falling apart past 25?

105
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,254
這就是你在醫學院學到的嗎？ 就這麼簡單?
ls that what they teach you at medical school, yeah? To take the piss?

106
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,337
無恥的婊子!  啊哦!
Cheeky bitch!  Ow!

107
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,539
有誰能讓我感覺成熟一點?
Can anyone make me feel any older?

108
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:00,961
哦，我們走. 哈羅.
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>  Hello.

咳，你一定會成為老師.  貝思 莎啦, 這是霍莉.
Hi, you must be the teacher.  Beth, Sarah, this is Holly.

110
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,128
朱諾 罩著的
Juno's protege.

111
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,587
我總是以為朱諾會在年輕的時候吃了她.  太好了.
l always thought Juno would eat her young.  Oh, nice.

112
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:13,038
我能控制好我自己。 謝謝.
l'm well able to handle myself, thanks very much.

113
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:16,622
我聽說過你. 你是違心到可以跳樓的人.
l've heard about you. You're that mentalist that jumps off buildings.

114
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:20,503
基礎跳躍.你真的應該試一下.  你現在住在美國?
Base jumping. You should try it, seriously.  So you live in America now?

115
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,085
用盡所有的 東西穿著戈爾韋粗法蘭絨開始吧, 你知道的.
Ran out of things to jump off in Galway, you know.

116
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,704
我總是尋找下一個更高的目標
l'm always searching for the next big high.

117
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,044
當然這你應該知道  不好意思?
Sure you'd know all about that.  Sorry?

118
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:31,006
朱諾給我看過一張照片 是你們一起爬山時拍的
Juno showed me a photo of when you used to climb together.

119
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,711
啊，我找到這個經典的照片了!
l found this classic picture. Ah!

120
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,962
不!  不!
Oh, no!  Oh, no!

121
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:41,002
看我們的狀態!  天啦，這太差了.
Look at the state of us!  Oh, my God. That's bad.

122
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,921
性感!
<i>Sexy!</i>

123
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,047
愛上每一天.
Love each day.

124
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:50,336
這不是保羅常說的嗎？.
Used to be something Paul used to say.

125
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,837
不管怎樣...乾杯
Anyway...cheers.

126
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:57,751
為我們的探險.
Here's to our adventure.

127
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:00,712
乾杯
Skol.  Cheers.

128
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:07,714
借火, 你這個混蛋
Come on, light, you bastard.

129
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:14,001
那麼，你以前去過山洞穴嗎?
So, have you done Boreham Caverns before?

130
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,296
我曾經在一本書上看到 它是旅遊勝地，不是用來探險的.
l saw it in a book once. lt's for tourists. lt's not adventure.

131
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:20,920
也許還有扶手 還有他媽的禮品店.
Might as well have hand rails and a fucking gift shop.

132
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,336
如果你集洞穴工作者，攀登者，跳高者...於一身
lf you're a caver, jumper, climber...

133
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,706
你只需按部就班，就像拉泡屎一樣簡單
<i>..</i>you just do it and not give a shite.

134
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:29,425
除非東西比你能得到的還大.
Or the thing that's bigger than you will get you.

135
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:38,541
朱諾: 霍莉，你嚮往探險? 我什麼時候讓你失望過?
JUNO: <i>You want adventure, Holly?</i> <i>When have l ever let you down?</i>

薩姆: 有幾分
SAM: <i>Kind of. Sort of.</i>

141

142
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:10,581
天啦！
Oh, my God.

143
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,131
天啦  呃，你是怎麼想的?
Oh, my Jesus!  What do you think, eh?

144
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:16,751
(Laughter)

145
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:20,294
他媽的能不能別說話?
Don't say a fucking word, all right?

146
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:22,083
它是聖誕禮物
lt was a Christmas present.

147
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:29,751
閉嘴.
Shut up.

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,753

What about you Holly? Got a man?  Oh...

149
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,340
跟朱諾一樣，我全身心的投入體育運動中.
l'm a sports fuck like Juno.

150
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:38,132
什麼？  我想麗貝卡也是吧
What?  Rebecca, too, l think.

151
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:44,958
可是當我老了 我想有一大堆的孩子.
HOLLY: <i>But when l'm older,</i> <i>l want to have lots of babies.</i>

152
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:49,377
貝絲, 莎啦是不是告訴過你...
JUNO: <i>Beth, did Sarah tell you that...</i>

153
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,873
(Birds calling)

154
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,707
(Wind chimes)

155
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,748
哦
(Knock at door)  Oh!

156
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,589
起床了.

00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,583
(Screams)

00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:22,506
我們七點出發，別遲到.
We're leaving at seven. Don't be late.

165
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,007
盡量吧
Try that.

166
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,623
皇后睡的跟死豬一樣
The queen is dead.

167
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,756
長久..去他媽的皇后.
Long live...the fucking queen.

168
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,873
(Laughter)

169
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:42,083
貝絲, 你不會要開車吧
JUNO: <i>Beth, you're not driving.</i>

170
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,084
你開車的話，我們永遠不會到達.  ,剪刀,石頭，布
lf you drive we'll never get there.  Paper, scissors, stone.

171
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,922
快點  你就是大混蛋。.
Come on.  Oh, you're a dick.

172
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:48,245
來吧  好了.
Go on.  OK.

173
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:51,711
你先出.  不，等一下. 三回合定勝負.
There you go.  No, wait, babe. Best of three.

174
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,215
我來開車，好嗎？
l'll drive. Right?

175
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,881
女士們，集體拍照
Ladies, group photo.

176
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:57,045
你最好快一點，我們快遲到了
You'd better hurry it up. We're running late.

177
00:15:57,091 --> 00:16:00,788
我看起來糟透了  我們都是. 笑一個.
l look like shit.  We all look like shit. Just give me a smile.

178
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,583
要不要取下帽子?  .取下
Hat? No hat?  No hat.

179
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,090
取下帽子  好了.
<i>No hat, no hat.</i>  <i>All right.</i>

180
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,965
快，快，快  說『』茄子『』
Run, run, run, run.  Say ''sausage''!

181
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,797
茄子！
ALL: Sausage!

182
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:40,625
莎啦 ，稍微減點速.  我正在陶醉之中.
Sarah, slow down a bit.  l'm having fun.

183
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,297
她正爽著呢.
She's having fun.

184
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:44,083
哦，轉彎，就在那兒轉彎! 
Whoa! Turn, turn, turn there.

185
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,005
咱們越野吧  太棒了.
Let's off road.  Great.

186
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,248
你應該喝一點水.
You should have some water.

187
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,423
調節這個表是不可能的 按鈕真他媽的太小了.
Trying to set this watch is impossible. The buttons are too fucking small.

188
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,540
不要管它.  那你為什麼戴著它呢?
Leave it alone.  Why do you wear it, anyway?

189
00:16:57,591 --> 00:17:01,004
我男朋友送給我的，觸景生情啊.  去他媽的感情.
My boyfriend gave it to me, it's sentimental.  lt's fucking mental.

190
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,336
不管是誰送給我，我都會把它撇了
Any guy that gave that to me, l'd dump him.

191
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,254
朱諾， 你確定我們路走對了嗎？
BETH: <i>Juno, are you sure this is the right way?</i>

192
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,665
放鬆。我從未迷過路.  了不起啊.
Relax, l've never been lost in my life.  Marvellous.

193
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,579
那麼你以前有沒有去過山洞穴?  沒有.
So have you done these caves before?  No.

194
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,300
但是它們沒什麼難度 相當安全，別擔心.
But they are only level two. Quite safe, don't worry.

195
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,789
我沒擔心什麼.  唯一的危險是我可能會睡著了.
l wasn't.  The only danger is that l might fall asleep.

196
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,709
伯瑞漢姆巨洞. 更像是伯瑞敦姆巨洞 
Boreham Caves. More like boredom caves.

197
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:05,708
停的好.  多謝.
Nice parking.  Thanks.

198
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:19,087
這一次在蓋耳崴，. 當我自助爬教堂時,
HOLLY: <i>This one time in Galway.</i> <i>when l freeclimbed the cathedral,</i>

199
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:22,296
神父追著我 一直到底樓.
<i>a priest chased me</i> <i>down the whole of the ground floor.</i>

200
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,664
太爽了.
<i>That was brilliant.</i>

201
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:28,247
雖然我笨不應該白費力氣的 霍麗，閉嘴.
<i>l shouldn't have wasted the effort, though.</i> REBECCA: <i>Holly, shut up.</i>

202
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,420
麗貝卡, 別理她.
Rebecca, leave her alone.

203
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:33,298
姑娘們，走了. 快來不及了.
OK, guys, let's get moving. We're running late.

204
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,163
趕快，跟上.
SAM: Come on, keep up.

205
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:48,833
霍麗，等一等. 懶蟲，快走.
SAM: Hey, Holly, wait up. REBECCA: Move it, short arse.

206
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:56,121
 哦，卡特，跟在後面. 趕快，你這混蛋
BETH: Oi, Carter, get to the back. HOLLY: Come on, you lazy bastard.

207
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,332
你終於趕上我了.
JUNO: You finally caught up with me.

208
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:13,713
朱諾，我們到了嗎?  前面半公里處有一條小河.
Juno, are we there yet?  There's a river about half a mile ahead.

209
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:16,921
到了之後, 我們順流而上就到了洞口,不是嗎?
When we reach it, we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?

210
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:19,917
她怎麼知道前面有一條小河? 我不同意.
How does she know there's a river up ahead? l can't hear a thing.

211
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,459
她是聞到的.
She can probably smell it.

212
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:24,079
他上周來這兒 探過路.
She came up here last week to check the route out.

213
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,545
這是第一原則 起草一份奮鬥計劃然後堅持到底.
<i>lt's rule number one</i>  <i>file a flight plan and stick to it.</i>

214
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,340
第二原則？?  不要迷路.
And rule number two?  Don't go wandering off.

215
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:35,123
你以為只有你熄燈後才會變黑呀. 下面都是漆黑的.
You think it's dark when you turn out the lights. Well, down there it's pitch black.

216
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,920
你可能會拖水，失去方向感...  好了好了.
You can get dehydration, disorientation...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:41,873
..得幽閉恐怖癥...  別廢話了.
<i>..</i>claustrophobia...  Blah, blah.

218
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:45,965

<i>..</i>panic attacks, paranoia, hallucinations,

219
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,675

220
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,833
(Squawking)

221
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:09,413
喂
Hey!

222
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,582

00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,165
耶，霍麗，親愛的。真正的拍照時間到了.
Yeah, lovely, Holly. A real Kodak moment.

224
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,131
不要碰它. 你不會想滾蛋吧.
Don't touch it.  You wouldn't want to piss it off.

225
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,745
薩姆，你怎麼看這個？一隻熊嗎？
What do you think did that, Sam? A bear?

226
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,956
這是什麼？天生的偵探?
What is this? Nature Detectives?

227
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:29,546
這兒應該有大足印的. 來吧.  薩姆，不要用他媽的樹枝刺它.
lt could have been Big Foot. Come on.  Sam, stop poking it with a fucking stick.

228
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,460
到了.
This is it.

229
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:58,793
你開玩笑吧!  恐怕不是.
You're having a laugh!  Afraid not.

230
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:03,377
我是英語教師, 不是盜墓的.
l'm an English teacher, not fucking Tomb Raider.

231
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,458
你會沒事的 .
You'll be fine.

232
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:16,671
好了，莎拉，貝思，你們下一個上. 薩姆跟 貝卡呆在一起.
JUNO: <i>OK, Sarah, Beth, you're up next.</i> <i>Sam, stay with Becca.</i>

233
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:18,506
跟著他做，你會沒事的.
<i>Do what she does and you'll be fine.</i>

234
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,997
霍麗，安全第一. 我不想這次有任何閃失.
Holly, safety first. l don't want any stunts this time.

235
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:24,547
你沒事吧?下面見.
You OK? See you down there.  No.

236
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:28,964
確保你的牛皮繩綁好了  你像這樣抓住它.
REBECCA: <i>Make sure your cow's tail is locked</i> <i>there and there. You hold on to this like that.</i>

237
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:31,082
看，我以前做過，你不知道嗎
Look, l have done this before, you know?

238
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:35,541
我只是照顧你而已. 我感謝你，稍微.
l'm only looking after you.  And l appreciate it, in small doses.

239
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,172
你必須看看地方.
JUNO: <i>You gotta see this place.</i>

240
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,539
太美 
lt's beautiful!

241
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:07,206
貝思，你絕對不會相信.  媽的!
JUNO: <i>You won't believe this, Beth.</i>  Oh, shit!

242
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:08,916

Shit, shit, shit.

243
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,289
哦，天啦。打死我我也想不到
Oh, my God, l'm gonna die.

244
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:19,832
(Panting)

245
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,626
太容易了.
Ah, piece of piss.

246
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:29,882
天啦
Oh, my God!

247
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:31,382
難以置信
<i>lt's incredible.</i>

248

媽的，走
Shit, move!

251
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:49,880
霍麗，在我的帶領下安全，有秩序的來，好嗎？
Holly, you do this safely, in order, following my lead. OK?

252
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:51,631
放鬆，慢點.
Take it slow and easy.

253
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:03,585
朱諾，.  你很靈巧
HOLLY: <i>Juno.</i>  Smart arse.

254
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,580
(Screeching)

255
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:30,794
(Screams)

256
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,460
(Screams)

沒事了.
lt's OK. lt's OK. lt's OK.

它們飛走了。它們已經飛走了，不信你看.
They're gone. They're gone now. Look.

259
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,627
一隻蝙蝠,兩隻蝙蝠 ........

霍麗，滾開.
Holly, fuck off.

263
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,750
哪一條路?
Which way?

264
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,082
離開這兒只有一條路 那就是順著繩子向下 .
There's only one way out of this chamber and that's down the pipe.

265
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,830
好了.
OK.

266
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,757
是一滴水.
JUNO: lt's a drop.

267
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:04,204
(Clattering)

268
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:05,537
什麼?
JUNO: OK?

269
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,250
霍麗，打開你的包
JUNO: Holly, chuck us your bag.

270
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:15,459
(Fizzing)

271
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:30,206
天啦
SARAH: Oh, my God!  (Laughter)

272
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:04,871
(Squeaking)

273
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:31,125
(Water dripping)

274
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,747
有什麼發現沒?
<i>(Laughs) Find anything good?</i>

275
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,881
耶穌啊  來吧，我們吃點東西吧.
Jesus Christ!  Come on, let's eat.

276
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:08,377
霍麗，你休息一下嗎?  我只想在深入下去.
Holly, would you take a break?  l just want to take a few more shots.

277
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:11,173
著山東比我想像的要冷.
This cave is a lot cooler than l thought.

278
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,663
嗨?
Hey?

279
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:18,707
我不餓.
Not hungry.

280
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:21,007
沒事吧?
Are you OK?

281
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,544
朱諾，我不會半途而廢的，我好得很.
Juno, l won't break. l'm fine.

282
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,832
我問你吃不吃  我知道.
l asked you for this.  l know.

283
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,040
呃，莎拉?
Um, Sarah?

284
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,881
我一直沒有機會說我......
<i>l haven't had a chance to say that l'm...</i>

285
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:40,125
我沒有在事故後多陪你一段時間
really sorry l didn't stay around longer after the accident.

286
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:47,963
不管怎樣...
Anyway...

287
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:51,255
..現在我們全在這兒彌補，行嗎?
<i>..</i>we're all here for you now, OK?

288
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,672
嗯.
Yeah.

289
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,750
我現在感覺有點力不從心. 可能是時差反映吧.
Look, sorry. l'm feeling a bit out of it. lt's probably jet lag.

290
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,046
我四處看看，好嗎?  好.
So l'm just going to take a look around, OK?  Yeah, OK.

291
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:02,662
為什麼不幫我們談一下路呢?
Why don't you try and find us the way through, huh?

292
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,956
嗨，不要走太遠.
Hey, don't go too far.

293
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,256
他怎麼呢? 她看起來像撞見鬼了.
What's up with her? She looks like she's seen a ghost.

294
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,709
她沒事
She's fine.

295
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:18,832
(Water dripping)

296
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,373
我發現新大陸了!
l've found the next passage!

297
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:49,338
就是這兒?它有點小，不是嗎?  嗨，嗨!
That's it? lt's a bit small, isn't it?  Hey, hey, hey!

298
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:52,297
這不是我想要的. 什麼?
l don't get this.  What?

299
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:55,043
著跟我叢書上看到 的不一樣
This is not how l imagined it from reading the book.

300
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:58,622
這就是為什麼我不相信書. 留下了太多的想像空間.
That's why l don't trust books. Leaves too much room for interpretation.

301
00:28:58,675 --> 00:29:00,215
有問題嗎？
Something wrong?

302
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:01,537
沒有.  好著呢.
No.  lt's nothing.

303
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:04,423
姑娘們，我去探路.
HOLLY: <i>l'm taking point, guys.</i>

304
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:09,213
小心。只要找到通過的路. 我們在這兒等著.
Careful. Just find the way through. We'll wait here.

305
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,373
(Splashing through water)

306
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,257
(Echoing laughter)

307
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:31,965
(Laughter)

308
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:04,913
莎拉?
Sarah?

309
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,206
媽的.  你還是跟在我後面嗎？
Shit.  <i>Are you still behind me?</i>

310
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:09,667
對.
Yes.

311
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,580
媽的!
Shit!

312
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,083
媽的!
(Strains with exertion) Shit!

313
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,830
莎拉? 姑娘們，是莎拉，她可能卡住了.
Sarah? Guys, it's Sarah, l think she might be stuck.

314
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:20,625
我被卡住了!
<i>l am stuck!</i>

315
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:23,622
BETH:沒事的，莎拉. 鎮靜，放鬆.
BETH: <i>All right, Sarah.</i> <i>Calm down, just relax.</i>

316
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,500
(Grunts)

317
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,955
我他媽的不能放鬆.
l can't fucking relax.

318
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,335
媽的
Fuck, fuck!

319
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:33,626
莎拉，你必須鎮定下來， 你唯一要做的就是呼吸.
Sarah, you have to calm down and the only way you're going to do that is to breathe.

320
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:37,336
好，慢慢的呼吸，保持呼吸
<i>OK, breathe slowly. Just keep breathing.</i>

321
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:39,457
(Sarah struggles for breath)

322
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,923
我做不到.
l can't. l can't.

323
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:47,126
我他媽不能呼吸. 莎拉，聽我說.
l can't fucking breathe.  <i>Sarah, OK, listen to me.</i>

324
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,082
只聽我說，好嗎?
Just listen to my voice, yeah?

325
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:53,871
莎拉，我來了. 好嗎？ 
Sarah, l'm coming. l'm coming back. OK? OK.

326
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:56,872
莎拉，你沒事吧?
Sarah, OK?

327
00:32:56,925 --> 00:33:00,705
聽我的，保持呼吸 
Listen to me, keep breathing. OK? Hey.

328
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,541
喂，喂.
Hey, hey.

329
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:08,122
好了.
OK. OK. OK.

330
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:12,382
看我這兒，莎拉，好嗎?  幫我.
Look here at me, Sarah, hey?  <i>Help me.</i>

331
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:15,755
傻啦，你擔心什麼呢? 看著我.
What are you so worried about, Sarah? Look at me.

332
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,873
呼吸，呼吸，好嗎?
OK, breathe. Breathe, OK?

333
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:20,294
喂，喂，喂，聽我的.
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

334
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:24,631
聽我說，你怕什麼呢?  我動不了!
Listen to me. What are you so afraid of?  l can't fucking move!

335
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:27,875
你可以的。莎拉，看著我.
You <i>can</i> move. Sarah, look at me, look at me.

336
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:33,546
最壞的情況已經發生了， 你不還好好的嗎 
The worst thing that could have happened to you has already happened and you're still here.

337
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:37,715
我發誓,這僅僅是一個山洞 誒有什麼值得害怕的
This is just a poxy cave and there's nothing left to be afraid of, l promise.

338
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:39,583
好嗎？
OK? OK?

339
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,707
嗨嗨，聽我說.
Hey. Hey, listen, listen.

340
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:45,668
聽我說，你會喜歡這個的. 您怎麼給檸檬性交高潮?
Listen to me, you'll love this one. How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

341
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:49,662
媽的，讓我聽你重複它 您怎麼給檸檬性交高潮?
God damn it, let me hear you say it. How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

342
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:52,169
你作什麼呢? 你您發癢它的柑橘. 
What do you do? You tickle its citrus. (Laughs)

343
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:53,958
好點了嗎？. 來.
OK, that's better. Come on.

344
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:57,836
好，我們要走了. 抓住我的胳膊好嗎?
OK, OK. All right, we're going to move now. Take hold of my arm, all right?

345
00:33:57,883 --> 00:34:00,632
我們將會緩慢的移動. 就這樣，拽住我胳膊?
We're going to move slowly. That's it, grab my arm, OK?

346
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:01,918
好，來吧.
OK, come on.

347
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:04,633
慢慢的，拽住我? 好了，走.
Just slowly. Pull on me, OK? OK, come on.

348
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:10,422
包. 我忘了裝繩子的包.
The rope bag. l forgot the rope bag.

349
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,331
好.
OK.

350
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,455
(Rumbling and crashing)

351
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:21,539
去他媽的包, 現在就走
OK, fuck the rope bag. OK, move, now!

352
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,669
立刻!
Now!

353
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:23,794
趕快!
Hurry up!

354
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:26,755
莎拉，快點!
Sarah, come on!

355
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,540
莎拉, 拽住繩子!
Sarah, keep hold of the rope!

356
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,707
(Muffled coughing)

357
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:52,131
莎拉?
(Coughing) BETH: Sarah?

358
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,288
恩.
Oh, ah.

359
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,248
你沒事吧?  我很好.
Are you OK?  l'm all right.

360
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,167
所有人都好吧
JUNO: ls everybody OK? ls everybody OK?

361
00:34:58,216 --> 00:35:00,171
他媽的別碰我. 麗貝卡?
Don't fucking touch me. SAM: Rebecca?

362
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:02,586
REBECCA: 我在這兒,我沒事. 貝斯,你受傷了嗎?
REBECCA: l'm here, l'm OK. Beth, are you injured?

363
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,877
沒有,我很好.
No, l'm fine.

364
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:08,416
在坍塌結束前不要輕舉妄動.  別擔心,朱諾,我們哪兒也不去.
Nobody move until the dust has settled.  Don't worry, Juno, we're not going anywhere.

365
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:10,622
(Coughing)

366
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:13,796
你可能是對的.
HOLLY: <i>You might be right about that.</i>

367
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:15,583
 耶穌啊.
REBECCA: Jesus.

368
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,957
現在怎麼辦?
HOLLY: So what's the story now?

369
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,461
REBECCA:根據導遊書來說, 這個洞有三條出口.
REBECCA: According to the guidebook, this cave system has three ways out.

370
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:27,873
這僅僅是一條. 朱諾,是這樣的嗎?
This is just one of them. lsn't that right, Juno?

371
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:30,375
朱諾,是這樣的,不是嗎?
<i>Juno, that's right, isn't it?</i>

372
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,757
查書.
Check the book.

373
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,707
我沒帶.  什麼?
l didn't bring it.  What?

374
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:39,501
N0 p0int.
No point.

375
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:42,712
朱諾,看在上帝的份上.
For Christ's sake, Juno.

376
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:45,246
我知道.我知道這不對.
<i>l knew it. l knew this wasn't right.</i>

377
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,756
你不是起草了山區救援計劃嗎？ 如果受不到我們的回話的話，他們回過來救我們.
You filed a flight plan to mountain rescue? lf we don't report in, they'll come looking for us.

378
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,622
這就是它應該起的作用 除非我提出一個伯瑞漢姆巨洞的奮鬥計劃
That's how it's supposed to work except l put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns

379
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:57,542
朱諾，這不是伯瑞漢姆巨洞，是嗎？
and this isn't Boreham Caverns, is it, Juno?

380
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:59,463
我們他媽的走錯山洞了?
We're in the wrong fucking cave?

381
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:02,376
霍麗是對的. 伯瑞漢姆巨洞是一個打著旅遊旗號的陷阱。
Holly was right. Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap.

382
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:08,291
不要血口噴人!  這不是探險. 這是一次自私的旅行.
Don't try and pin this fucking shite on me!  This is not caving. This is an ego trip.

383
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:11,126
麗貝卡, 我不知道會搞成這樣.
JUNO: Rebecca, l didn't know this was going to happen.

384
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:12,916
這就是我們堅信的.
This is exactly what we believe in.

385
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,371
我們說過，, 如果沒有一點風險, 有什麼意思?
We said, if there's no risk, what's the point?

386
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,747
不要試著證明這是對的.
Don't try and justify this.

387
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,671
我們在哪兒？
Where... Where are we?

388
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:23,215
他還沒有名字. 這是一個新大陸.
lt hasn't got a name. lt's a new system.

389
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:25,877
我希望我們所有人都來探索.
l wanted us all to discover it.

390
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:28,673
從未有人下來過.
Noone's ever been down here before.

391
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:31,383
你他媽在欺騙我.  天啦
You're fucking kidding me.  Oh, God!

392
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:36,332
 我們怎麼才能離開這兒?  可能沒有出路了.
BETH: <i>How the hell do we get out?</i> HOLLY: <i>There may not be a way out.</i>

393
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:39,002
 看來我們不能原路返回了.
JUNO: <i>Look, there's no going back now.</i>

394
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,213
我們的著一條路出去 要抓緊時間.
We have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward.

395
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:44,581
BETH: 你他媽以為你再做什麼?
BETH: <i>What the fuck do you think you're doing?</i>

396
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:48,081
我們全都相信你.  你說這會對莎拉有很大幫助的.
<i>We all trusted you. You told me</i> <i>this was going to be good for Sarah.</i>

397
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:51,627
你知道她經歷了什麼嗎?
<i>Have you any idea what she's been through?</i>

398
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:54,507
不, 因為你不能足夠快地離開, 你這個自私鬼.
<i>No, cos you couldn't get away fast enough,</i> <i>you selfish cow.</i>

399
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,540
 貝絲,你知道什麼呀?
JUNO: <i>You know what, Beth?</i>

400
00:36:56,591 --> 00:37:00,039
在坍塌中我們都有損失.
We all lost something in that crash.

401
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:06,498
帶我們離開這兒.
Just get us out of here.

402
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:14,128
山洞有時會坍塌. 不過概率很低.
JUNO: <i>Look, cave systems</i> <i>sometimes break ground. lt's a small chance.</i>

403
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:16,331
但是如果我們帶在這兒,我們都會完蛋.
But if we stay here, we'll die.

404
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:18,373
走吧.
<i>Let's go.</i>

405
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:24,082
(Falling rubble)

406
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,840
等一下!  怎麼了?
JUNO: <i>Wait!</i>  What?

407
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:54,169
薩姆,不要動. 不要動.
Don't move, Sam. Just don't move.

408
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:56,088
呆在那兒.
Stay right there.

409
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:25,296
媽的. 沒路了.
Oh, shit. No more.

410
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:39,287
(Falling stone)  Thanks, Beth.

411
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:41,912
現在我知道有多深了.
Now l know how far down it is.

412
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,756
那麼,現在怎麼辦?
So, what now?

413
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,291
我們中的一個人得到對面 那樣的話她可以為你們加一條繩子.
One of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys.

414
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:54,547
我有三個凸輪, 我至少還要三個. 其它的繩包那兒去了?
l have three cams, l need at least three more. Where's the other rope bag?

415
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,126
哪兒去了?
Where is it?

416
00:38:58,175 --> 00:39:00,248
山東坍塌的時候,我們弄丟了.
We lost it, when the cave collapsed.

417
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:02,538
對不起.
Sorry.

418
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,090
幫我一下.
Help me.

419
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,082
(Shallow breathing)

420
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,790
(Grunting)

421
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:50,834
貝卡,快點.
<i>Come on, Becca.</i>

422
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:02,461
(Grunting)

423
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,630
Aargh!  You got it.

424
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:25,798
趕快.
Come on, come on.

425
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,038
麗貝卡,趕快.
JUNO: <i>Come on, Rebecca.</i>

426
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:31,212
麗貝卡,趕快.
<i>Come on, Rebecca.</i>

427
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:33,332
你還等什麼呢?
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

428
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:37,382
媽的.  你沒事吧?
Fuck.  <i>Are you OK?</i>

429
00:40:37,425 --> 00:40:39,250
出什麼問題了?
What's wrong?

430
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,048
沒事,我好著呢.
lt's nothing. l'm all right.

431
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,335
好.
OK.

432
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:50,333
(Gasps in frustration)

433
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,458
(Gasps)

434
00:40:54,508 --> 00:40:56,913
好了, 松一點繩子.
(Breathless) All right, more slack.

435
00:40:58,341 --> 00:40:59,798
松一點繩子,謝謝.
More slack, thanks.

436
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:03,957
(Gasps)

437
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,580
媽的!
Fuck!

438
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,752
(Panting)

439
00:41:14,883 --> 00:41:17,122
媽的
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

440
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,373
好了. 幹得好.
OK. JUNO: <i>Well done.</i>

441
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:26,916
好了. 把繩子的另一頭扔給我.
(Breathless) OK. Throw me the right rope.

442
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:31,621
好.
OK.

443
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,621
好.
OK.

444
00:41:41,383 --> 00:41:42,580
快.
Come on.

445
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,287
耶!
Yeah!

446
00:41:56,341 --> 00:42:00,666
你讓它看起來容易.  嗯,你讓它看起來困難
Now, you make it look easy.  Yeah, well, you make it look hard.

447
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:09,541
哦. Beth,不要往下看.一直走.
Oh. JUNO: <i>Don't look down, Beth. Keep going.</i>

448
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,542
一直走. 你沒事的,你很安全
Just keep going. REBECCA: You're OK. You're safe.

449
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:19,090
好. 你到了.
Good. There you go.

450
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,165
這是關於我還是你?
Was this about me or you?

451
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:34,379
我們, 回到我們過去的樣子.
lt's about us, getting back to what we used to be.

452
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:37,664
我希望我們證實這個地方,並給它命名.
l wanted us to claim this place, name it.

453
00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:40,913
我想可能是你的名字.
l thought maybe your name.

454
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:42,423
或者是我們的.
Or maybe yours.

455
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:50,790
你做得不錯,趕快.
REBECCA: You're doing well. Come on.

456
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,007
趕快.
Come on.

457
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:58,002
你到了. 來吧,把手給我.
There you are. Come on, give me your hand.

458
00:42:59,341 --> 00:43:01,415
(Grunting)

459
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,006
(Unhooks cam)

460
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,288
朱諾?
Juno?

461
00:43:15,383 --> 00:43:17,753
我們的所有東西都派得上用場.
We'll need everything we've got.

462
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:21,165
拉緊.
<i>Haul it in.</i>

463
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:43,205
媽的.
Fuck.

464
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:48,663
(Grunts)

465
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:03,496
好!
Yes!

466
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:07,413
(Grunts)

467
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:08,876
伸出手.
Reach.

468
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:10,547
伸出手
<i>Reach out.</i>

469
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:12,379
Aargh!

470
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:14,834
朱諾!
Juno!

471
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:15,913
不
No!

472
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:28,418
(Screams)

473
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,539
朱諾,沒事的,我們會拉住你的.
BETH: <i>Juno, it's OK, we've got you.</i>

474
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,001
好了,拉!
<i>OK, pull!</i>

475
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,123
(Grunting)

476
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:41,919
薩姆! 霍麗, 讓我來.
BETH: Sam! SAM: Holly, let me pass.

477
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:44,672
麗貝卡, 把手給我們檢查一下.
SAM: <i>Rebecca, show me your hand.</i>

478
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:52,498
(Groaning)

479
00:44:59,925 --> 00:45:01,501
我們走.
Let go, let go.

480
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,464
這是什麼意思?  我們不是第一批到這兒的人.
What does it mean?  lt means we're not the first.

481
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,254
這是巖釘,對嗎?
lt's a piton, right?

482
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,500
如果他們還在這兒的話, 我們會有更大的機會出去.
lf cavers were here, there's a better chance of us getting out.

483
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,792
這件裝備至少也有100年的歷史. 沒有人會再用這樣的東西了.
This equipment is at least 1 00 years old. Noone uses stuff like this any more.

484
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:17,839
而且, 如果有人曾經下來過 並且成功出去了,
Besides, if anyone had been down here and made it out,

485
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,589
這個山洞就應該有名字了.
they would have named it already.

486
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,663
(Groaning)

487
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:23,252
貝卡, 你還好嗎?
JUNO: <i>Becca, are you OK?</i>

488
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,413
死不了.
l'll live.

489
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:31,294
霍麗, 看起來怎麼樣?
Holly, how does it look?

490
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:33,415
又變窄了, 不過我還能過.
<i>lt's tight again, but l can get through.</i>

491
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:35,955
好,繼續走. 我們馬上就跟上來了.
OK, keep going. We'll be right behind you.

492
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:51,165
下面有些東西.
HOLLY: Hey, there's something down here.

493
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:26,877
姑娘們,太令人驚奇了 可是我們手電的電池快沒電了.
Guys, it's amazing, but the batteries on our lights will run out.

494
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:30,337
我建議我們一直走.  等一下.
<i>So l suggest we keep moving.</i>  Wait a minute. Wait.

495
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:33,879
貝絲,怎麼了?  朱諾,點一根你的火焰棒.
What is it, Beth?  Juno, light up one of your flares.

496
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:37,372
我們沒時間耗在這兒.  點一根你的火焰棒.
We don't have time for this.  Just light a flare.

497
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:53,042
貝絲,真的可愛, 可他媽的沒用嘛.  不,看著它,你看到什麼了?
Really lovely, Beth, but it's fucking useless.  No, look at it. What do you see?

498
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:55,165
你會看到山, 山洞 ...
<i>You've got the mountain, the cave...</i>

499
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:57,787
有兩個出口.
and there's two entrances.

500
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:04,623
你真是他媽的天才.  老虎總有發威的時候.
You are a fucking genius.  l have my moments.

501
00:47:04,675 --> 00:47:07,542
這說明還有一條出去的路?  讓我們找出來吧.
This means there's another way out?  Let's find out.

502
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:10,085
趕快!
Come on!

503
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:31,207
婊子養的!  走哪一條路?
Bastard!  Which way?

504
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:33,332
霍麗,把你的打火機給我.
Holly, give me your lighter.

505
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:36,922
快.  給.
Come on.  Here.

506
00:47:41,675 --> 00:47:42,836
媽的!
Fuck!

507
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:46,876
快  狗屎!
Come on! Come on!  Shit!

508
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:53,042
這條路!  喂,霍麗!
That one!  Hey! Holly!

509
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:57,247
,霍麗,慢一點!
Holly, slow down!

510
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:03,539
小心,霍麗
JUNO: <i>Holly! Careful!</i>

511
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,789
太陽光,我看到太陽光了! 
HOLLY: Daylight! l can see daylight!

512
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,751
霍麗,小心,慢點
<i>Holly! Careful! Slow down!</i>

513
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,632
霍麗,這不是太陽光
<i>Holly, it's not daylight!</i>

514
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:23,370
救命!  穩住!
Help me!  Hold on!

515
00:48:24,591 --> 00:48:26,747
活計,拽住 ...
Guys! Hold...

516
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:29,373
霍麗!
Holly!

517
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:38,129
薩姆,到著下面來
Sam! Get down here!

518
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:39,418
霍麗!
Holly!

519
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:42,708
霍麗!
<i>Holly!</i>

520
00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:58,669
霍麗! 回答我!
<i>Holly! Answer me!</i>

521
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:07,715
開來我腿受傷了!
l think l hurt my leg!

522
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:10,958
不要動!我們下來救你來了.
<i>Don't move! We're coming down to you.</i>

523
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,957
哦,媽的
Oh, fuck!

524
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,547
不,媽的
(Screams) No! Fuck!

525
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:26,710
(Groans)

526
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:32,746
最好有人下來!
Someone better get down here!

527
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,630
真他媽噁心.  貝絲,不是現在,不是這兒!
Oh, that's fucking disgusting.  Beth! Not here, not now!

528
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:49,254
我們得幫忙.每人抓住一角. 我們得把她從水中移走.
We need help. Everybody grab a corner. We need to move her out of the water.

529
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:53,838
好了,輕輕的. 抬!
Nice and easy now. And...lift!

530
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:54,961
Argh!

531
00:49:57,133 --> 00:50:00,296
你混蛋!  朱諾,去找些東西製作一個夾板.
You fuckers!  Juno, find something to make a splint out of.

532
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:03,339
好了,我抓住她了.  朱諾,利用一個軸
lt's OK, l've got her.  Hey, Juno, use one of the ice axes.

533
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:05,172
你會好起來的,甜心.
SAM: You'll be all right, sweetheart.

534
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,623
(Child laughs)

535
00:50:18,258 --> 00:50:20,332
好了.
OK.

536
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:24,502
莎拉!  朱諾,沃需要你在這兒幫忙.
Sarah!  Juno, l'm gonna need your help here.

537
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,256
莎拉!  朱諾!
Sarah!  Juno!

538
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,580
抓住她的胳膊. 呆會兒你得按住她.
Take hold of her arm. You'll have to hold her down.

539
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:31,090
你要幹什麼?
What are you gonna do?

540
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:35,127
我得給你包紮傷口,固定上夾板 但在骨頭突出的時候沒法做.
l need to dress the wound and rig up a splint, but l can't while the bone is protruding.

541
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:37,130
我得把骨頭壓回去.
l need to push it back in.

542
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:40,918
恨死你了.  我知道.
l hate you.  l know.

543
00:50:40,966 --> 00:50:41,996
作吧.
Do it.

544
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:59,378
咬住這個.
Bite down on this.

545
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:02,209
壓住她.  他媽的咬住別放,好嗎?
Keep hold of her.  Just fucking bite down, OK?

546
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:04,332
開始!
Go!  (Screams)

547
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:09,506
來吧!
<i>Come on!</i>

548
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,623
(Holly screams in distance)

549
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:19,081
寶貝,咬住了.
Just keep biting down, baby.

550
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:21,254
來吧.
Come on.

551
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:25,793
什麼人遞給我一個急救包.
OK, someone get me a medical kit.

552
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:30,880
好了.冷靜.會好起來的
OK, OK, OK. Calm down. lt'll be all right.

553
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,212
(Gasps)

554
00:51:55,383 --> 00:51:56,710
(Panting)

555
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:09,207
(Gasps)  What are you doing?

556
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:11,628
我看到隧道前面有一些東西.
l just saw something ahead in the tunnel.

557
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:17,589
沙拉,我對你發誓, 我要帶你離開這兒.
Sarah, l promise you, l'm gonna get you out of here.

558
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,789
可是你不配合的話我就無能為力了.
But l can't do it unless you're with me.

559
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:21,915
莎拉?
<i>Sarah?</i>

560
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:24,921
莎拉!
Sarah!

561
00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:28,040
莎拉,看著我.
Sarah, look at me.

562
00:52:28,841 --> 00:52:30,915
這兒什麼也沒有.
There's nothing there.

563
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:36,745
這是我能做得最好的啦.
That's the best l can do.

564
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,663
它將會像地獄般的疼痛 而且你不能壓傷口  可至少你可以走了.
lt'll hurt like hell and you can't put any weight on it, but at least you can move.

565
00:52:40,716 --> 00:52:44,662
他們幾個世紀前就來過了. 捆在這兒的人都會變成骨架.
They combed these mountains centuries ago. Anyone trapped would be a skeleton now.

566
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:46,671
這只是看起來而已.  什麼?
That is just what it looked like.  What?

567
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:48,837
莎拉以為她看到一個人了.  S看到什麼?
Sarah thinks she saw someone.  Saw what?

568
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:51,418
不是以為, 我確實看到了一個人.
l don't <i>think</i> l saw someone, l saw someone.

569
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:54,215
不是這樣的, 你聽到了怪聲 然後在心理作用下"看到了".
No, you heard something and saw what you wanted to see.

570
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:57,955
現在很黑. 使人產生幻覺.  我可以確切地描述我所看到的.
lt's the dark. lt plays tricks on people.  l can describe exactly what l saw.

571
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,089
你看到什麼了?  一個人,我看到一個人.
What did you see?  A man. l saw a man.

572
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:03,207
你確定?  如假包換!
REBECCA: <i>Are you sure?</i>  Yes!

573
00:53:03,258 --> 00:53:06,919
而且這不是第一次了.  我認為我以前看到過, 但是現在我確定了.
And it's not the first time. l thought l saw someone before, but now l'm sure.

574
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:10,746
如果有人在這兒的話, 可能會幫助我們出去
Look, if there is somebody down here, then maybe they can help get us out.

575
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,466
沙拉,這兒沒人. 忘了它吧!
Sarah, there's noone down here. Forget about it!

576
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:15,794
我們得把霍麗從這兒移走.
Hey, we have to get Holly out of here.

577
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:18,045
好不好? 這是我們的當務之急.
OK? This is all that matters right now.

578
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:21,883
貝絲!  沒事了.
Beth!  lt's OK.

579
00:53:21,925 --> 00:53:23,998
是嗎!媽的
ls it? Fuck!

580
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,127
媽的.
Fuck me.

581
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:29,248
你得保持體溫.
SAM: <i>You've got to keep warm.</i>

582
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,501
為什麼走開了? 太陽光在那兒.
BETH: Why are we walking away? There was daylight back there.

583
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,836
 這不是太陽光. 它是4A84A4D8里的磷發出的光.
JUNO: lt wasn't. lt was phosphorus in the rock.

584
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:39,000
我們在地表的兩公里以下, 這兒唯一的光是我們發出來的.
We're two miles underground, the only light down here is ours.

585
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,166
看起來陽光就他媽在我眼前
HOLLY: Argh! Well, it looked like fucking daylight to me.

586
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,209
走對了!
Right tunnel!

587
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:17,960
我扶著你,好嗎?
l got you. OK? (Holly moans)

588
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,790
(Groans in pain)

589
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,666
耶穌啊! 這是什麼地方?
BETH: Jesus! What is this place?

590
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:33,797
霍麗, 紅外線開關在哪兒??
Holly, where's the infrared button?

591
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:43,376
動物屍體.
SARAH: <i>Dead animals.</i>

592
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:45,747
成百上千.
<i>Hundreds of them.</i>

593
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,340
姑娘們,這可不是什麼好兆頭.
BETH: This is not good, guys.

594
00:55:47,383 --> 00:55:49,457
我們能從這兒出去嗎?走哪條路?
REBECCA: Can we get out of here? Which way?

595
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:51,582
快點.
Come on.

596
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:56,543
我不知道.  你不知道?這是什麼意思?
l don't know. BETH: What do you mean, you don't know?

597
00:55:56,591 --> 00:56:00,715
一點風也沒有.  任何一條隧道都有可能是, 選一個吧.
There's no breeze. lt could be any one of these tunnels. Take your pick.

598
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:03,293
媽的,喂!
Oh, fuck it! Hello!

599
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:07,382
不要這樣!  有人在嗎?
Please!  ls there anybody there?

600
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:09,498
喂!
Hello!

601
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,663
(Screams)

602
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:18,755
在那兒! 在上面! 在牆壁上面!
JUNO: lt's there! lt's up there! lt's there on the roof!

603
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,622
他媽的地獄, 你看到...? 那他媽是什麼?
Fucking hell, did you see...? What the fuck was that?

604
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:32,293
不知道! 他移動的很快,我很難看清它!
l don't know! lt moved so fast, l could barely see it!

605
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:35,623
我從未看到有人想他那樣爬!  我早就告訴你我看到個人了!
l've never seen anyone climb like that!  l told you l saw someone!

606
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:37,879
這不是人!  夠了.
That was not a human being!  Screw this.

607
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:40,543
咱們挑一條路碰碰運氣吧. 走!
Let's take our chances and pick a tunnel. Move!

608
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:43,707
(Screeching)

609
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:53,082
發生什麼事了?
What's happening?

610
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:55,800
媽的! 他把我們包圍了.
Oh, shit! lt's circling us.

611
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,836
它在哪兒?  這條路!快!
Where is it?  This way! Move!

612
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:12,789
霍麗,我們得走了.  快,走!
Holly! We've got to move. We've got to move.  Come on! Move it!

613
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:16,207
 霍麗,快點! 走了,快
JUNO: <i>Come on, Holly! Move it! Let's go!</i>

614
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,334
朱諾,火焰棒! 仍了它!  媽的!
Juno, the flare! Get rid of it!  Fuck!

615
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,920
霍麗, 一直走,快 !
JUNO: Holly, keep moving, come on! (Holly groans)

616
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,040

Get away, you fucker!

624
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,547

(Whimpers)

628
01:00:00,175 --> 01:00:02,082
不要拋下我.
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

629
01:00:26,008 --> 01:00:28,922
媽的,我的電池沒電了.
Oh, fuck. My battery's gone dead.

630
01:00:30,466 --> 01:00:31,923
他們在哪兒?
Where are they?

631
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:37,040
其他人出什麼事了?
What's happened to the others?

632
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:40,089
貝卡請告訴我我們將要離開這個鬼地方.
Becca, please say we're gonna get out of here.

633
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:43,457

媽的.
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

關了手電.
Turn the light off.

 貝卡!
JUNO: <i>Becca!</i>

659
01:06:38,341 --> 01:06:42,121
她正在發出的聲音會把 這兒的每一隻這種東西吸引到她頭上去.
The noise she's making, she'll bring every one of those things down on her head.

660
01:06:42,175 --> 01:06:44,628
只要不是吸引到我頭上.

01:10:08,258 --> 01:10:09,632
好.
OK.

673
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:11,748
安全！.
lt's all clear.

674
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,876
(Screeches)

675
01:10:43,716 --> 01:10:45,209
薩姆，快跑!
Sam, run!

676
01:11:07,675 --> 01:11:09,048
(Screeches)

677
01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:31,498
我們聽到你為莎拉哭泣.
We heard you crying for Sarah.

678
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,714
其他人在哪兒?
Where are the others?

679
01:11:38,925 --> 01:11:40,998
他們... 他們帶走了霍麗.
They... They took Holly.

680
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:44,707
貝絲...
Beth...

681
01:11:47,216 --> 01:11:48,839
Beth已經死了.
Beth's dead.

682
01:11:58,883 --> 01:12:00,957
(Juno sobs)

683
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:06,207
薩姆...
Sam...

684
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,422
..這是什麼東西?
<i>..</i>what is that thing?

685
01:12:14,425 --> 01:12:17,422
我不知道.不過，他們確實像人.
l don't know. Well, it does look human.

686
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:21,875
趕快，我們得在這些東西找到我們之前 找到路出去.
Come on, we need to find the way out before those things find us.

687
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:23,465
不.
No.

688
01:12:23,508 --> 01:12:26,873
薩姆 ，告訴我們怎麼跟他鬥.
Sam, tell us what we're fighting.

689
01:12:27,716 --> 01:12:29,422
恩..
Well...

690
01:12:30,591 --> 01:12:32,665
..他們完全瞎了.
<i>..</i>they're totally blind.

691
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:38,002
從我們已經看到的來推斷, 我認為他們用聲音來捕獵. 就像蝙蝠一樣.
And judging from what we've seen, l'd say they use sound to hunt with. Like a bat.

692
01:12:40,508 --> 01:12:43,589
他們已經進化到 非常適應生活在漆黑的這兒.
And they've evolved perfectly to live down here in the dark.

693
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:51,081
不管他們是什麼, 他們到地面捕捉獵物.
Whatever they are, they go to the surface to hunt.

694
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:55,079
他們把獵物帶到這兒來吃, 通過一個入口.
And they bring their food back down here to eat, through an entrance.

695
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:01,122
聽著，如果我們足夠安靜 並且躲過這些笨蛋...
Listen, if we can stay quiet enough and evade these fuckers...

696
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,250
..我想我找到出去的方法了.
<i>..</i>l think l found the way out.

697
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,958
你怎麼看?
You think?

698
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:11,708
我們已經發現了一些攀登齒輪， 不管是誰帶下來的 ，給我們標出了路.
The climbing gear we found  whoever brought that down here marked their route.

699
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:15,875
我找到這些標記了  那我們還等什麼呢?
l found those markings.  Well, what are we waiting for?

700
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,962
莎拉
Sarah.

701
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:22,332
找不到莎拉，我不會走.
l'm not leaving without Sarah.

702
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,623
莎拉!
(Gasps) Sarah!

703
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:50,290
天啦.
Oh, God.

704
01:13:51,175 --> 01:13:52,916
天啦.
Oh, God.

705
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,373
天啦  不.
Oh, God. No.

706
01:13:57,258 --> 01:13:58,537
莎拉...
Sarah...

707
01:14:00,175 --> 01:14:01,881
我會帶你出去.
l'm getting you out of here.

708
01:14:01,925 --> 01:14:03,583
(Groans in agony)

709
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,878
不要碰我. 不要碰我.
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

710
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:11,583
我聽到朱諾叫我.
l heard Juno calling me.

711
01:14:11,633 --> 01:14:14,880
我去找她, 然後我們回來救你.
l'm gonna go and find her, and we're gonna come back and get you out.

712
01:14:14,925 --> 01:14:16,998
不，離她遠一點.
No, stay away from her.

713
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:20,047
什麼?  我變成這樣都是她害的.
What?  She did this to me.

714
01:14:20,091 --> 01:14:23,006
什麼?  她遺棄了我.
What?  <i>She left me.</i>

715
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,672
不是, 他不會這樣的. 不是.
No, she didn't. No.

716
01:14:24,716 --> 01:14:26,790
莎拉 莎拉...
Shh.  Sarah...

717
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:28,500
(Gurgles)

718
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:30,623
不要相信她.
Don't trust her.

719
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,872
你自己找出路吧.
You find your own way out.

720
01:14:33,925 --> 01:14:35,998
沒事了
lt's OK. lt's all right.

721
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:39,581
貝絲，我不會拋下你的 我不會拋下你的.
l'm not gonna leave you, Beth. l'm not gonna leave you.

722
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:41,707
我不會把你拋在這兒不管的
l'm not leaving you here, OK?

723
01:14:41,758 --> 01:14:44,044
貝絲，到這兒來
Come here. Beth!

724
01:14:51,175 --> 01:14:53,248
這是朱諾的.
This is Juno's.

725
01:14:56,841 --> 01:14:58,915
這是從保羅那兒來的
lt's from Paul.

726
01:15:00,716 --> 01:15:02,790
不.
Oh, no.

739
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:04,256
閉上眼睛.
Close your eyes.

740
01:16:21,508 --> 01:16:23,582
(Panting)
