Listen, we don't have to do this, you know.

61

We can head back and stay in town.

Get wasted, go to a barn dance.

63

Brandy shot?  Yeah, yeah.

102

l'm well able to handle myself, thanks very much.

112
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:16,622
l've heard about you. You're that mentalist that jumps off buildings.

113
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:20,503
Base jumping. You should try it, seriously.  So you live in America now?

114
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,085
Ran out of things to jump off in Galway, you know.

115
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,704
l'm always searching for the next big high.

116
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,044
Sure you'd know all about that.  Sorry?

117
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:31,006
Juno showed me a photo of when you used to climb together.

118
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,711
l found this classic picture. Ah!

The queen is dead.

166
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,756
Long live...the fucking queen.

167
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,873
(Laughter)

168
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:42,083
JUNO: <i>Beth, you're not driving.</i>

169
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,084
lf you drive we'll never get there.  Paper, scissors, stone.

170
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,922
Come on.  Oh, you're a dick.

171
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:48,245
Go on.  OK.

172
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:51,711
There you go.  No, wait, babe. Best of three.

173
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,215
l'll drive. Right?

174
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,881
Ladies, group photo.

175
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:57,045
You'd better hurry it up. We're running late.

176
00:15:57,091 --> 00:16:00,788
l look like shit.  We all look like shit. Just give me a smile.

177
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,583
Hat? No hat?  No hat.

178
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,090
<i>No hat, no hat.</i>  <i>All right.</i>

179
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,965
Run, run, run, run.  Say ''sausage''!

180
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,797
ALL: Sausage!

181
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:40,625
Sarah, slow down a bit.  l'm having fun.

182
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,297
She's having fun.

183
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:44,083
Whoa! Turn, turn, turn there.

184
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,005
Let's off road.  Great.

185
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,248
You should have some water.

186
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,423
Trying to set this watch is impossible. The buttons are too fucking small.

187
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,540
Leave it alone.  Why do you wear it, anyway?

188
00:16:57,591 --> 00:17:01,004
My boyfriend gave it to me, it's sentimental.  lt's fucking mental.

189
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,336
Any guy that gave that to me, l'd dump him.

190
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,254
BETH: <i>Juno, are you sure this is the right way?</i>

191
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,665
Relax, l've never been lost in my life.  Marvellous.

192
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,579
So have you done these caves before?  No.

193
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,300
But they are only level two. Quite safe, don't worry.

194
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,789
l wasn't.  The only danger is that l might fall asleep.

195
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,709
Boreham Caves. More like boredom caves.

196
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:05,708
Nice parking.  Thanks.

197
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:19,087
HOLLY: <i>This one time in Galway.</i> <i>when l freeclimbed the cathedral,</i>

198
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:22,296
<i>a priest chased me</i> <i>down the whole of the ground floor.</i>

199
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,664
<i>That was brilliant.</i>

200
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:28,247
<i>l shouldn't have wasted the effort, though.</i> REBECCA: <i>Holly, shut up.</i>

201
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,420
Rebecca, leave her alone.

202
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:33,298
OK, guys, let's get moving. We're running late.

203
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,163
SAM: Come on, keep up.

204
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:48,833
SAM: Hey, Holly, wait up. REBECCA: Move it, short arse.

205
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:56,121
BETH: Oi, Carter, get to the back. HOLLY: Come on, you lazy bastard.

206
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,332
JUNO: You finally caught up with me.

207
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:13,713
Juno, are we there yet?  There's a river about half a mile ahead.

208
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:16,921
When we reach it, we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?

209
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:19,917
How does she know there's a river up ahead? l can't hear a thing.

210
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,459
She can probably smell it.

211
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:24,079
She came up here last week to check the route out.

212
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,545
<i>lt's rule number one</i>  <i>file a flight plan and stick to it.</i>

213
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,340
And rule number two?  Don't go wandering off.

214
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:35,123
You think it's dark when you turn out the lights. Well, down there it's pitch black.

215
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,920
You can get dehydration, disorientation...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:41,873
<i>..</i>claustrophobia...  Blah, blah.

217
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:45,965
<i>..</i>panic attacks, paranoia, hallucinations,

218
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,675

219
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,833
(Squawking)

220
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:09,413
Hey!

221
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,582
Eurgh.

222
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,165
Yeah, lovely, Holly. A real Kodak moment.

223
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,131
Don't touch it.  You wouldn't want to piss it off.

224
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,745
What do you think did that, Sam? A bear?

225
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,956
What is this? Nature Detectives?

226
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:29,546
lt could have been Big Foot. Come on.  Sam, stop poking it with a fucking stick.

227
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,460
This is it.

228
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:58,793
You're having a laugh!  Afraid not.

229
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:03,377
l'm an English teacher, not fucking Tomb Raider.

230
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,458
You'll be fine.

231
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:16,671
JUNO: <i>OK, Sarah, Beth, you're up next.</i> <i>Sam, stay with Becca.</i>

232
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:18,506
<i>Do what she does and you'll be fine.</i>

233
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,997
Holly, safety first. l don't want any stunts this time.

234
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:24,547
You OK? See you down there.  No.

235
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:28,964
REBECCA: <i>Make sure your cow's tail is locked</i> <i>there and there. You hold on to this like that.</i>

236
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:31,082
Look, l have done this before, you know?

237
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:35,541
l'm only looking after you.  And l appreciate it, in small doses.

238
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,172
JUNO: <i>You gotta see this place.</i>

239
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,539
lt's beautiful!

240
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:07,206
JUNO: <i>You won't believe this, Beth.</i>  Oh, shit!

241
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:08,916
Shit, shit, shit.

242
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,289
Oh, my God, l'm gonna die.

243
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:19,832
(Panting)

244
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,626
Ah, piece of piss.

245
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:29,882
Oh, my God!

246
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:31,382
<i>lt's incredible.</i>

249
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:43,745
Shit, move!

250
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:49,880
Holly, you do this safely, in order, following my lead. OK?

251
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:51,631
Take it slow and easy.

252
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:03,585
HOLLY: <i>Juno.</i>  Smart arse.

lt's OK. lt's OK. lt's OK.

257
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:39,715
They're gone. They're gone now. Look.

258
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,627
HOLLY: <i>(As The Count) One bat, two bats.</i>

259

50 bats.

261
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,920
Holly, fuck off.

262
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,750
Which way?

263
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,082
There's only one way out of this chamber and that's down the pipe.

264
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,830
OK.

265
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,757

JUNO: Holly, chuck us your bag.

Jesus Christ!  Come on, let's eat.

275
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:08,377
Holly, would you take a break?  l just want to take a few more shots.

276
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:11,173
This cave is a lot cooler than l thought.

277
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,663
Hey?

278
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:18,707
Not hungry.

279

Are you OK?

280
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,544
Juno, l won't break. l'm fine.

281

l asked you for this.  l know.

282
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,040
Um, Sarah?

283

<i>l haven't had a chance to say that l'm...</i>

Yeah.

00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,750
Look, sorry. l'm feeling a bit out of it. lt's probably jet lag.

289
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,046
So l'm just going to take a look around, OK?  Yeah, OK.

290
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:02,662
Why don't you try and find us the way through, huh?

291
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,956
Hey, don't go too far.

292
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,256
What's up with her? She looks like she's seen a ghost.

293

She's fine.

l don't get this.  What?

298
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:55,043
This is not how l imagined it from reading the book.

299
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:58,622
That's why l don't trust books. Leaves too much room for interpretation.

300
00:28:58,675 --> 00:29:00,215
Something wrong?

301
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:01,537
No.  lt's nothing.

Fuck, fuck!

318
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:33,626
Sarah, you have to calm down and the only way you're going to do that is to breathe.

319
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:37,336
<i>OK, breathe slowly. Just keep breathing.</i>

320

l can't fucking breathe.  <i>Sarah, OK, listen to me.</i>

323
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,082
Just listen to my voice, yeah?

324
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:53,871
Sarah, l'm coming. l'm coming back. OK? OK.

325
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:56,872
Sarah, OK?

326
00:32:56,925 --> 00:33:00,705
Listen to me, keep breathing. OK? Hey.

327
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,541
Hey, hey.

328
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:08,122
OK. OK. OK.

329
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:12,382
Look here at me, Sarah, hey?  <i>Help me.</i>

330
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:15,755
What are you so worried about, Sarah? Look at me.

331
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,873
OK, breathe. Breathe, OK?

332
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:20,294
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

333
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:24,631
Listen to me. What are you so afraid of?  l can't fucking move!

334
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:27,875
You <i>can</i> move. Sarah, look at me, look at me.

335
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:33,546
The worst thing that could have happened to you has already happened and you're still here.

336
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:37,715
This is just a poxy cave and there's nothing left to be afraid of, l promise.

337
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:39,583
OK? OK?

338
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,707
Hey. Hey, listen, listen.

339
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:45,668
Listen to me, you'll love this one. How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

340
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:49,662
God damn it, let me hear you say it. How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

341
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:52,169
What do you do? You tickle its citrus. (Laughs)

342
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:53,958
OK, that's better. Come on.

343
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:57,836
OK, OK. All right, we're going to move now. Take hold of my arm, all right?

344
00:33:57,883 --> 00:34:00,632
We're going to move slowly. That's it, grab my arm, OK?

345
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:01,918
OK, come on.

346
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:04,633
Just slowly. Pull on me, OK? OK, come on.

347
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:10,422
The rope bag. l forgot the rope bag.

348
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,331
OK.

349
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,455
(Rumbling and crashing)

350
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:21,539
OK, fuck the rope bag. OK, move, now!

351
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,669
Now!

352
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:23,794
Hurry up!

353
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:26,755
Sarah, come on!

354
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,540
Sarah, keep hold of the rope!

355
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,707
(Muffled coughing)

356
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:52,131
(Coughing) BETH: Sarah?

357
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,288
Oh, ah.

358
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,248
Are you OK?  l'm all right.

359
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,167
JUNO: ls everybody OK? ls everybody OK?

360
00:34:58,216 --> 00:35:00,171
Don't fucking touch me. SAM: Rebecca?

361
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:02,586
REBECCA: l'm here, l'm OK. Beth, are you injured?

362
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,877
No, l'm fine.

363
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:08,416
Nobody move until the dust has settled.  Don't worry, Juno, we're not going anywhere.

364
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:10,622
(Coughing)

365
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:13,796
HOLLY: <i>You might be right about that.</i>

366
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:15,583
REBECCA: Jesus.

367
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,957
HOLLY: So what's the story now?

368
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,461
REBECCA: According to the guidebook, this cave system has three ways out.

369
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:27,873
This is just one of them. lsn't that right, Juno?

370
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:30,375
<i>Juno, that's right, isn't it?</i>

371
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,757
Check the book.

372
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,707
l didn't bring it.  What?

373
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:39,501
No point.

374
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:42,712
For Christ's sake, Juno.

375
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:45,246
<i>l knew it. l knew this wasn't right.</i>

376
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,756
You filed a flight plan to mountain rescue? lf we don't report in, they'll come looking for us.

377
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,622
That's how it's supposed to work except l put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns

378
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:57,542
and this isn't Boreham Caverns, is it, Juno?

379
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:59,463
We're in the wrong fucking cave?

380
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:02,376
Holly was right. Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap.

381
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:08,291
Don't try and pin this fucking shite on me!  This is not caving. This is an ego trip.

382
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:11,126
JUNO: Rebecca, l didn't know this was going to happen.

383
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:12,916
This is exactly what we believe in.

384
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,371
We said, if there's no risk, what's the point?

385
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,747
Don't try and justify this.

386
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,671
Where... Where are we?

387
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:23,215
lt hasn't got a name. lt's a new system.

388
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:25,877
l wanted us all to discover it.

389
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:28,673
Noone's ever been down here before.

390
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:31,383
You're fucking kidding me.  Oh, God!

391
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:36,332
BETH: <i>How the hell do we get out?</i> HOLLY: <i>There may not be a way out.</i>

392
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:39,002
JUNO: <i>Look, there's no going back now.</i>

393
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,213
We have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward.

394
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:44,581
BETH: <i>What the fuck do you think you're doing?</i>

395
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:48,081
<i>We all trusted you. You told me</i> <i>this was going to be good for Sarah.</i>

396
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:51,627
<i>Have you any idea what she's been through?</i>

397
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:54,507
<i>No, cos you couldn't get away fast enough,</i> <i>you selfish cow.</i>

398
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,540
JUNO: <i>You know what, Beth?</i>

399
00:36:56,591 --> 00:37:00,039
We all lost something in that crash.

400
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:06,498
Just get us out of here.

401
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:14,128
JUNO: <i>Look, cave systems</i> <i>sometimes break ground. lt's a small chance.</i>

402
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:16,331
But if we stay here, we'll die.

403
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:18,373
<i>Let's go.</i>

404
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:24,082
(Falling rubble)

405
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,840
JUNO: <i>Wait!</i>  What?

406
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:54,169
Don't move, Sam. Just don't move.

407
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:56,088
Stay right there.

408
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:25,296
Oh, shit. No more.

409
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:39,287
(Falling stone)  Thanks, Beth.

410
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:41,912
Now l know how far down it is.

411
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,756
So, what now?

412
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,291
One of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys.

413
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:54,547
l have three cams, l need at least three more. Where's the other rope bag?

414
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,126
Where is it?

415
00:38:58,175 --> 00:39:00,248
We lost it, when the cave collapsed.

416
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:02,538
Sorry.

417
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,090
Help me.

418
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,082
(Shallow breathing)

419
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,790
(Grunting)

420
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:50,834
<i>Come on, Becca.</i>

421
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:02,461
(Grunting)

422
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,630
Aargh!  You got it.

423
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:25,798
Come on, come on.

424
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,038
JUNO: <i>Come on, Rebecca.</i>

425
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:31,212
<i>Come on, Rebecca.</i>

426
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:33,332
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

427
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:37,382
Fuck.  <i>Are you OK?</i>

428
00:40:37,425 --> 00:40:39,250
What's wrong?

429
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,048
lt's nothing. l'm all right.

430
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,335
OK.

431
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:50,333
(Gasps in frustration)

432
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,458
(Gasps)

433
00:40:54,508 --> 00:40:56,913
(Breathless) All right, more slack.

434
00:40:58,341 --> 00:40:59,798
More slack, thanks.

435
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:03,957
(Gasps)

436
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,580
Fuck!

00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,752
(Panting)

438
00:41:14,883 --> 00:41:17,122
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

439
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,373
OK. JUNO: <i>Well done.</i>

440
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:26,916
(Breathless) OK. Throw me the right rope.

441
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:31,621
OK.

442
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,621
OK.

443
00:41:41,383 --> 00:41:42,580
Come on.

444
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,287
Yeah!

445
00:41:56,341 --> 00:42:00,666
Now, you make it look easy.  Yeah, well, you make it look hard.

446
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:09,541
Oh. JUNO: <i>Don't look down, Beth. Keep going.</i>

447
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,542
Just keep going. REBECCA: You're OK. You're safe.

448
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:19,090
Good. There you go.

449
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,165
Was this about me or you?

450
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:34,379
lt's about us, getting back to what we used to be.

451
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:37,664
l wanted us to claim this place, name it.

452
00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:40,913
l thought maybe your name.

453
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:42,423
Or maybe yours.

454
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:50,790
REBECCA: You're doing well. Come on.

455
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,007
Come on.

456
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:58,002
There you are. Come on, give me your hand.

Juno?

460
00:43:15,383 --> 00:43:17,753
We'll need everything we've got.

461
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:21,165
<i>Haul it in.</i>

462
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:43,205

464
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:03,496
Yes!

466
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:08,876
Reach.

<i>Reach out.</i>

Juno!

00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:15,913
No!

<i>OK, pull!</i>

Let go, let go.

479

What does it mean?  lt means we're not the first.

480

lt's a piton, right?

481

lf cavers were here, there's a better chance of us getting out.

00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,792
This equipment is at least 1 00 years old. Noone uses stuff like this any more.

483
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:17,839
Besides, if anyone had been down here and made it out,

484
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,589
they would have named it already.

485
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,663
(Groaning)

486
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:23,252
JUNO: <i>Becca, are you OK?</i>

487
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,413
l'll live.

488
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:31,294
Holly, how does it look?

489
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:33,415
<i>lt's tight again, but l can get through.</i>

490
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:35,955
OK, keep going. We'll be right behind you.

491
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:51,165
HOLLY: Hey, there's something down here.

492
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:26,877
Guys, it's amazing, but the batteries on our lights will run out.

493
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:30,337
<i>So l suggest we keep moving.</i>  Wait a minute. Wait.

494
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:33,879
What is it, Beth?  Juno, light up one of your flares.

495
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:37,372
We don't have time for this.  Just light a flare.

496
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:53,042
Really lovely, Beth, but it's fucking useless.  No, look at it. What do you see?

497
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:55,165
<i>You've got the mountain, the cave...</i>

498
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:57,787
and there's two entrances.

499
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:04,623
You are a fucking genius.  l have my moments.

500
00:47:04,675 --> 00:47:07,542
This means there's another way out?  Let's find out.

501
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:10,085
Come on!

502
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:31,207
Bastard!  Which way?

503
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:33,332
Holly, give me your lighter.

504
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:36,922
Come on.  Here.

505
00:47:41,675 --> 00:47:42,836
Fuck!

506
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:46,876
Come on! Come on!  Shit!

507
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:53,042
That one!  Hey! Holly!

508
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:57,247
Holly, slow down!

509
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:03,539
JUNO: <i>Holly! Careful!</i>

510
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,789
HOLLY: Daylight! l can see daylight!

511
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,751
<i>Holly! Careful! Slow down!</i>

512
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,632
<i>Holly, it's not daylight!</i>

513
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:23,370
Help me!  Hold on!

514
00:48:24,591 --> 00:48:26,747
Guys! Hold...

515
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:29,373
Holly!

516
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:38,129
Sam! Get down here!

517
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:39,418
Holly!

518
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:42,708
<i>Holly!</i>

519
00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:58,669
<i>Holly! Answer me!</i>

520
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:07,715
l think l hurt my leg!

521
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:10,958
<i>Don't move! We're coming down to you.</i>

522
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,957
Oh, fuck!

523
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,547
(Screams) No! Fuck!

524
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:26,710
(Groans)

525
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:32,746
Someone better get down here!

526
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,630
Oh, that's fucking disgusting.  Beth! Not here, not now!

527
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:49,254
We need help. Everybody grab a corner. We need to move her out of the water.

528
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:53,838
Nice and easy now. And...lift!

529
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:54,961
Argh!

530
00:49:57,133 --> 00:50:00,296
You fuckers!  Juno, find something to make a splint out of.

531
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:03,339
lt's OK, l've got her.  Hey, Juno, use one of the ice axes.

532
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:05,172
SAM: You'll be all right, sweetheart.

533
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,623
(Child laughs)

534
00:50:18,258 --> 00:50:20,332
OK.

535
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:24,502
Sarah!  Juno, l'm gonna need your help here.

536
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,256
Sarah!  Juno!

537
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,580
Take hold of her arm. You'll have to hold her down.

538
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:31,090
What are you gonna do?

539
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:35,127
l need to dress the wound and rig up a splint, but l can't while the bone is protruding.

540
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:37,130
l need to push it back in.

541
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:40,918
l hate you.  l know.

542
00:50:40,966 --> 00:50:41,996
Do it.

543
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:59,378
Bite down on this.

544
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:02,209
Keep hold of her.  Just fucking bite down, OK?

545
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:04,332
Go!  (Screams)

546
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:09,506
<i>Come on!</i>

547
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,623
(Holly screams in distance)

548
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:19,081
Just keep biting down, baby.

549
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:21,254
Come on.

550
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:25,793
OK, someone get me a medical kit.

551
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:30,880
OK, OK, OK. Calm down. lt'll be all right.

552
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,212
(Gasps)

553
00:51:55,383 --> 00:51:56,710
(Panting)

554
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:09,207
(Gasps)  What are you doing?

555
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:11,628
l just saw something ahead in the tunnel.

556
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:17,589
Sarah, l promise you, l'm gonna get you out of here.

557
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,789
But l can't do it unless you're with me.

558
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:21,915
<i>Sarah?</i>

559
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:24,921
Sarah!

560
00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:28,040
Sarah, look at me.

561
00:52:28,841 --> 00:52:30,915
There's nothing there.

562
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:36,745
That's the best l can do.

563
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,663
lt'll hurt like hell and you can't put any weight on it, but at least you can move.

564
00:52:40,716 --> 00:52:44,662
They combed these mountains centuries ago. Anyone trapped would be a skeleton now.

565
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:46,671
That is just what it looked like.  What?

566
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:48,837
Sarah thinks she saw someone.  Saw what?

567
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:51,418
l don't <i>think</i> l saw someone, l saw someone.

568
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:54,215
No, you heard something and saw what you wanted to see.

569
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:57,955
lt's the dark. lt plays tricks on people.  l can describe exactly what l saw.

570
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,089
What did you see?  A man. l saw a man.

571
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:03,207
REBECCA: <i>Are you sure?</i>  Yes!

572
00:53:03,258 --> 00:53:06,919
And it's not the first time. l thought l saw someone before, but now l'm sure.

573
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:10,746
Look, if there is somebody down here, then maybe they can help get us out.

574
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,466
Sarah, there's noone down here. Forget about it!

575
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:15,794
Hey, we have to get Holly out of here.

576
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:18,045
OK? This is all that matters right now.

577
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:21,883
Beth!  lt's OK.

578
00:53:21,925 --> 00:53:23,998
ls it? Fuck!

579
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,127
Fuck me.

580
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:29,248
SAM: <i>You've got to keep warm.</i>

581
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,501
BETH: Why are we walking away? There was daylight back there.

582
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,836
JUNO: lt wasn't. lt was phosphorus in the rock.

583
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:39,000
We're two miles underground, the only light down here is ours.

584
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,166
HOLLY: Argh! Well, it looked like fucking daylight to me.

585
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,209
Right tunnel!

586
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:17,960
l got you. OK? (Holly moans)

587
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,790
(Groans in pain)

588
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,666
BETH: Jesus! What is this place?

589
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:33,797
Holly, where's the infrared button?

590
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:43,376
SARAH: <i>Dead animals.</i>

591
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:45,747
<i>Hundreds of them.</i>

592
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,340
BETH: This is not good, guys.

593
00:55:47,383 --> 00:55:49,457
REBECCA: Can we get out of here? Which way?

594
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:51,582
Come on.

595
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:56,543
l don't know. BETH: What do you mean, you don't know?

596
00:55:56,591 --> 00:56:00,715
There's no breeze. lt could be any one of these tunnels. Take your pick.

597
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:03,293
Oh, fuck it! Hello!

598
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:07,382
Please!  ls there anybody there?

599
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:09,498
Hello!

600
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,663
(Screams)

601
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:18,755
JUNO: lt's there! lt's up there! lt's there on the roof!

602
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,622
Fucking hell, did you see...? What the fuck was that?

603
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:32,293
l don't know! lt moved so fast, l could barely see it!

604
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:35,623
l've never seen anyone climb like that!  l told you l saw someone!

605
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:37,879
That was not a human being!  Screw this.

606
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:40,543
Let's take our chances and pick a tunnel. Move!

607
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:43,707
(Screeching)

608
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:53,082
What's happening?

609
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:55,800
Oh, shit! lt's circling us.

610
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,836
Where is it?  This way! Move!

611
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:12,789
Holly! We've got to move. We've got to move.  Come on! Move it!

612
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:16,207
JUNO: <i>Come on, Holly! Move it! Let's go!</i>

613
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,334
Juno, the flare! Get rid of it!  Fuck!

614
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,920
JUNO: Holly, keep moving, come on! (Holly groans)

615
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,040

Get off!

622
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:26,998
Get away, you fucker!

623
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,547

<i>Don't leave me.</i>

Oh, fuck. My battery's gone dead.

629
01:00:30,466 --> 01:00:31,923
Where are they?

630
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:37,040
What's happened to the others?

631
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:40,089
Becca, please say we're gonna get out of here.

632
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:43,457
OK. OK.

633
01:00:43,508 --> 01:00:45,582
OK.

The noise she's making, she'll bring every one of those things down on her head.

659
01:06:42,175 --> 01:06:44,628
As long as it's not on mine.

(Screeches)

676
01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:31,498
We heard you crying for Sarah.

677
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,714
Where are the others?

678
01:11:38,925 --> 01:11:40,998
They... They took Holly.

679
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:44,707
Beth...

680
01:11:47,216 --> 01:11:48,839
Beth's dead.

681
01:11:58,883 --> 01:12:00,957
(Juno sobs)

682
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:06,207
Sam...

683
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,422
<i>..</i>what is that thing?

684
01:12:14,425 --> 01:12:17,422
l don't know. Well, it does look human.

685
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:21,875
Come on, we need to find the way out before those things find us.

686
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:23,465
No.

687
01:12:23,508 --> 01:12:26,873
Sam, tell us what we're fighting.

688
01:12:27,716 --> 01:12:29,422
Well...

689
01:12:30,591 --> 01:12:32,665
<i>..</i>they're totally blind.

690
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:38,002
And judging from what we've seen, l'd say they use sound to hunt with. Like a bat.

691
01:12:40,508 --> 01:12:43,589
And they've evolved perfectly to live down here in the dark.

692
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:51,081
Whatever they are, they go to the surface to hunt.

693
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:55,079
And they bring their food back down here to eat, through an entrance.

694
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:01,122
Listen, if we can stay quiet enough and evade these fuckers...

695
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,250
<i>..</i>l think l found the way out.

696
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,958
You think?

697
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:11,708
The climbing gear we found  whoever brought that down here marked their route.

698
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:15,875
l found those markings.  Well, what are we waiting for?

699
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,962
Sarah.

700
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:22,332
l'm not leaving without Sarah.

701
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,623

Oh, God. No.

705
01:13:57,258 --> 01:13:58,537

l'm getting you out of here.

707
01:14:01,925 --> 01:14:03,583
(Groans in agony)

708
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,878
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

709
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:11,583
l heard Juno calling me.

710
01:14:11,633 --> 01:14:14,880
l'm gonna go and find her, and we're gonna come back and get you out.

711
01:14:14,925 --> 01:14:16,998
No, stay away from her.

712
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:20,047
What?  She did this to me.

713
01:14:20,091 --> 01:14:23,006
What?  <i>She left me.</i>

714
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,672
No, she didn't. No.

715
01:14:24,716 --> 01:14:26,790
Shh.  Sarah...

716
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:28,500
(Gurgles)

717
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:30,623
Don't trust her.

718
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,872
You find your own way out.

719
01:14:33,925 --> 01:14:35,998
lt's OK. lt's all right.

720
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:39,581
l'm not gonna leave you, Beth. l'm not gonna leave you.

721

722
01:14:41,758 --> 01:14:44,044
Come here. Beth!
