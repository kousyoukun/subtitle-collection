00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:13,100
'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
from the Channel 5 newsroom.

00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:17,771

9
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:44,756
Hi, Miller. Mr Desmond's waiting for you.
Go right in.

10
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:49,052
'...expected at any moment,
a Professor Otto Hagenbach...'

11
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:52,139
- Ah, Miller.
- '...one of the original planners,

12
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:57,435
'will undoubtedly enable us
to obtain more precise information.'

13
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:01,857
You heard?
He's arriving tomorrow morning at 11.

14
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:05,193
- Take one of the best cameramen.
- Why me, in particular?

15
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,030
Because I want an exhaustive interview
which will reassure our viewers.

16
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,617
Not just the truth - pure and simple?

17
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:15,996
Forget the philosophy, Miller.
Just do what you're told.

18
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,749
If possible, sir. Only if possible.

19
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,267
He hasn't arrived yet.
Find out what runway they're landing on.

20
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:38,768
OK.

21
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:52,782
'Clipper 981. Cell code OK.

22

23

Stand by.

'Glipswick tower,
this is flight 777 out of Selkirk...'

26
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:15,263
- Hey, Willy. Come over here.
- ...Flight 777, will do. Stand by.

27
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,515
- What have you got?
- Unidentified trace.

28
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,601
What's the bearing?

29
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:24,564
About 30 miles northeast,
altitude approximately 5,000.

30
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:25,857
Hm.

31
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:29,527
'...request permission to land.'

32
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,781
Control tower here. There's a trace
approaching from the northeast.

33
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,784
Distance about 30 miles.

'We've seen it. Doesn't seem to fit in

'We're trying to identify it now.'

36
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,585
Try to make contact.

37
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,173
Calling aircraft about 30 miles northeast
of Glipswick tower. Identify yourself.

38
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:53,260
Calling aircraft 30 miles
northeast of Glipswick tower.

39
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:55,887
Identify yourself, please.

40
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,598
Could be his radio isn't working.

41
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:03,561
'Glipswick tower,
this is Twin Beachcraft, A101579.

Glipswick tower to Beachcraft.
Please stand by.

44
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:15,824
It's a Hercules military transport.
That's strange.

45
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,201
It doesn't have any markings on it.

46
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:30,588
It looks like he's going to land.
He's coming in on 16.

47
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:33,883
Make sure that runway's clear.
Pete, declare an emergency, please.

48

Attention ground crew.
Emergency landing runway 16.

Repeat, emergency landing runway 16.

00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:22,974
Hey, you up there. Who are you?

51
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:28,146
Where's the pilot?

52
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:35,028
Harry here. Nobody inside answers.

53
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:48,249
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know. What do you think?

54
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,251
Let's see.

55
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:14,901
- What's the story?
- Nobody answers, sir.

56
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:20,907
You inside, open the door
and come outwith your hands in the air.

57
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,168
This is Commander Davidson
of the Airport Security Police.

58
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:33,670
You are surrounded.

59
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:38,049
In the name of the law,
I order you to come out.

60
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:41,553
You have just 30 seconds
to make up your mind.

61
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:18,756
Watch it. Door's opening.

62
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,773
It's Professor Hagenbach.

63
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:03,486
I don't believe it.

64
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:04,821
My God!

65
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:12,036
Let's get out of here.

66
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:15,290
Let's go!

67
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,876
Interrupt the programme.
We're transmitting a special news flash.

68
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:26,838
- Does the chief know about it?
- There's no time to tell him.

69
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:29,340
Am I in charge of the broadcast or not?

70
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:32,927
Whatever you says, master.
Your wish is my command.

71
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:39,267
Wake up, Terry.

72
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:42,562
Drop your powderpuff, girl,
and announce Miller.

73
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,105
Special news flash.

74
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,733
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

75
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:52,822
We are interrupting our transmission of
<i>It's All Music</i> for a special news flash.

76
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:57,744
At the end of the news flash, we will return
with our regular programme. Thank you.

77
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:01,247
Oh, shit! Just when I was gonna do
my first close-up.

78
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:04,125
Oh, shut up, will you?
I want to listen to it!

79
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,296
At 11 o'clock, an event without precedent
took place at the airport of the city.

80
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,591
An airplane with no nationality
landed on the south runway,

81
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:14,969
ignoring all instructions
from the control tower.

82
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,930
'The airport police immediately converged
on the scene of the...

83
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:21,142
'...surrounding the aircraft...'

84
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,311
Yes, sir. I told him that.

85
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,229
Right away, chief.

86
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:27,774
'The order had absolutely no effect.'

87
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,987
What the hell are you doing?
Why did you interrupt my broadcast?

88
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,073
Don't get mad at me, it's not my fault.
The chief rang down.

89
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,667
- Albert, what the hell's going on here?
- They're UFOs.

90
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:50,087
- It's bound to happen sooner or later.
- You read too many comic books.

91
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:53,382
Hey, you can say what you want,
but I'm not going home alone tonight.

92
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:55,426
You can sleep at my house.
I'll protect you!

93
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,387
Yeah, yeah...
Who's gonna protect me from him?

94
00:13:58,513 --> 00:14:02,183
Will you all shut up?
We're back on the air in 20 seconds.

95
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,643
Come on.

96
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:05,853
Is it possible that you're not aware

97
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,190
of the trouble that broadcast
could have stirred up?

98
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:13,528
- Or the uproar that would have followed it?
- I'm well aware of that, General Murchison.

99
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,282
But I am a journalist and my job is
to keep the public informed.

100
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:24,705
Mr Miller, listen to me - very carefully.

101
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,502
Something very serious
has happened at the airport,

102
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:32,171
but until we conclude our investigation

103
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:37,260
and take the necessary countermeasures,
nothing is going to leak out - nothing.

104
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:41,055
The Defence Department
has strictly forbidden it.

105
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,809
I don't give a damn
about the Defence Department.

106
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,644
In a democratic country

107
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,856
nobody is allowed to interfere
with the freedom of the press.

108
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:51,440
For any reason whatsoever.

109
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,693
I see.

110
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,906
Mr Desmond,
as the person in charge of this station,

111
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,033
you will be held directly responsible

112
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:04,078
for the dissemination
of any tendentious news.

113
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,414
I'm sure you realise what you're risking.

114
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,126
Don't worry. We won't transmit anything
without your authorisation.

115
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,586
Thank you.

116
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:15,298
Good morning.

117
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:23,139
I'm fed up with you, Miller.
I'm suspending you from all duties.

118
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,893
No, you're not. I quit.

119
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,773
OK, I'll take care of it first thing.
Yeah.

120
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,859
Excuse me, honey. Sorry.

121
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:45,369
- Hello?
- Hello, Liz. Ls my wife there?

122
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:48,497
She... She just went out this minute.

123
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:52,752
- Call her back immediately.
- Yes. Yes, sir. Of course.

124
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:09,018
Mrs Miller?

125
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:11,020
Mrs Miller!

126
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:18,277
I am sorry, sir, but I missed her.

127
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:21,656
But you'll be able to reach her
at the hospital in half an hour.

128
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,660
She said she wasn't feeling well today.
She was going to stay home.

129
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,329
I don't know,
maybe she changed her mind.

130
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,165
OK, Liz. OK.

131
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,556
Please don't answer. It'll stop.

132
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,808
This is your day off.

133
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,288
- Yes?
- 'Major Warren Holmes?'

134
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:54,999
- Speaking.
- 'This is Civil Defence headquarters.

135
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:58,169
'General Murchison would like you
to come down here right away.'

136
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,714
- Why? What's up?
- 'The general will explain everything.

137
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,384
'Come right over.
The drill is maximum urgency.'

138
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:10,723
I'm sorry, my love.
We'll finish our conversation later.

139
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,940
- What's wrong? Don't you like it?
- No, on the contrary.

140
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,735
But every time I look at it,
I get a feeling of...

141
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,072
"Of death",
is that what you were going to say?

142
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:29,283
It's funny, but it's the first time

143
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,286
that one of your works
has given me a feeling like that.

144
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,371
It's the truth. I'm sorry.

145
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:37,666
I can't say that you're wrong.

146
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,794
When I look at it objectively,

147
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,630
I mean,
when I'm not actually working on it,

148
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,509
I almost get the feeling
that I wasn't the one who made it,

149
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:49,553
but some other being outside of me.

150
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:53,349
- It frightens me.
- That sounds like science fiction.

151
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:58,062
Metaphysics, if you want.
It's better if we don't take it too seriously.

152
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:01,690
- I'll drop it, if you like.
- No. Don't even think of it.

153
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:05,945
Imagine what the world would have lost
had Michelangelo destroyed his works

154
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,698
- at the request of Major Warren Holmes!
- Yes, but I'm not Michelangelo.

155
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,202
To me, my love, you're much more.

156
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:19,166
Wake up, Major!
If not, you're never going to get to work.

157
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,915
Number one, zoom out to her waist
and hold on her.

158
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:02,960
Good.

159
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,674
On two, hit it!

160
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:34,635
Holy shit!
What the hell's going on down there?

161
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:40,993
Aagh!

162
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,918
Civil Defence?
This is Channel 5 TV station.

163
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:53,922
We're being attacked.
For God's sake, send somebody fast!

164
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,135
Get out of here.

165
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:07,436
Aagh!

166
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,566
Aagh!

167
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:33,207
Hi, Louise.

168
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,792
- Well, how are you feeling today, Phil?
- Horrible!

169
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:39,713
I feel like somebody who's waiting
for the hatchet guy to chop off his head.

170
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,175
Well, now. That sounds like
an improvement over yesterday.

171
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,969
- Temperature?
- Normal, Doctor.

172
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:48,805
Continue with antibiotics
every eight hours.

173
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,935
Well, if it isn't my favourite patient!
Hi, Jim. How are you feeling today?

174
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,521
I feel a lot better,
but I can't play soccer yet.

175
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:58,607
You've got a couple more weeks
and that's it.

176
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:03,445
Before you know it, you'll be running up and down
that field, making one goal after another, really.

177
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,448
- Dr Kramer's the best there is.
- Ls that the truth?

178
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:08,534
The truth.

179
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,580
Last night I had this nightmare.
It was all about my leg.

180
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,708
There was a big explosion.
It was right here in the hospital.

181
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,962
I got hit and my leg got cut off.

182
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,424
Well, we don't have to worry
over that any longer.

183
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,927
Jimmy, your leg's going to be just fine -
the truth.

184
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:31,306
- Well, OK.
- I'll stop by and see you later.

185
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:38,855
Our latest reports
show the presence of attackers here,

186
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:41,733
here and here.

187
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:45,487
This enables us to determine
a presumed line of march

188
00:26:45,612 --> 00:26:48,699
from the airport to the city limits,

189
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:52,160
then quite definitely
in a northeastern direction.

190
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:54,830
We don't know if this indicates
a predetermined plan,

191
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:58,166
but we must react as though it did,
we have no other choice.

192
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:05,799
Unfortunately, the reports coming in
from our various information centres,

193
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,469
the latest from the National
Science Academy, are all rather sketchy.

194
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:15,309
But they do suggest, even in a vague way,
the type of countermeasure to adopt.

195
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,228
You may proceed.

196
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,755
This is the body of one of the attackers.

197
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,383
It was picked up on the runway
at the airport.

198
00:27:48,508 --> 00:27:53,764
The autopsy categorically excludes
an extra-terrestrial being.

199
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:59,269
His molecular structure clearly establishes him
as a member of the human race -

200
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:02,522
a paradox, when you consider
what they've been doing.

201
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,274
Colonel, please.

202
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:09,071
I am Colonel Donahue
for the Institute of Atomic Research.

203
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,743
The examination of the various tissue
samples we have taken from the body

204
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:17,120
reveal the presence of
a high degree of radioactivity,

205
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:21,750
far superior to the level normally
tolerated by the human organism.

206
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:27,673
In addition, we have found, more or less,
recent hyper-tissue regeneration.

207
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:30,133
Can you make that a little simpler,
Colonel?

208
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,970
Some of your colleagues may not have the
same theoretical or technical background.

209
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,141
In other words, this individual
and others like him,

210
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:41,478
have been subjected to strong doses
of atomic radiation

211
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:44,147
which increased their physical capacities
beyond the norm.

212
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:47,943
- How far beyond?
- That's difficult to say.

213
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:51,780
But it is a fact that these cells,
subjected to every treatment we know,

214
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:53,990
have turned out to be almost
indestructible.

215
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,284
In short... it's a kind of a superman.

216
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,538
- Much more than that.
- What do you mean?

217
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:02,833
I mean that the abnormal strengthening
of the cell's vital qualities

218
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,377
has increased their direct
genetic capacity.

219
00:29:05,502 --> 00:29:09,256
In other words, Major, the victims
of these creatures are contaminated,

220
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,049
even if they only suffer minor injuries.

221
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:14,970
Then they can reproduce themselves,
Colonel, say, indefinitely?

222
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:16,930
That, more or less, Major, is correct.

223
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,559
And you say, with our weapons,
they cannot be destroyed?

224
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:23,562
- No, that their substance can't.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

225
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:26,481
- Isn't that the same thing?
- Not exactly.

226
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:31,111
A machine may be indestructible,
yet its functioning may still be blocked.

227
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,738
How?

228
00:29:32,863 --> 00:29:36,450
By interrupting the feeding process,
for example.

229
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,910
Atomic contamination
destroys the efficiency

230
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:41,079
of red blood cells in very short order.

231
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:45,208
That is why new blood is always needed
for these creatures.

232
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,878
True, the human organism
is greatly strengthened.

233
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:51,214
However,
the power still remains the brain.

234
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:53,884
A lesion to the nerve centres
can produce paralysis.

235
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:56,720
The procedure
stops the complex entirely.

236
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:59,181
You mean that only bullets
damaging the cranium

237
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:01,099
can stop these... these monsters?

238
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:05,228
This corpse is the proof. It's the only
lifeless body we have recovered.

239
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:07,689
The cerebral apparatus
has been destroyed.

240
00:30:07,814 --> 00:30:09,357
Thank you, Colonel.

241
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:11,485
General Reedman,
you've heard everything.

242
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,822
The order to every soldier
and police officer is "aim for the brain".

243
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,616
We must be very specific about that.

244
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:22,788
As for our combat plan,
we'll follow emergency Plan H

245
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:26,750
and keep Plan B in reserve
in case the situation gets out of hand.

246
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,294
That's all for the moment, gentlemen.
Thank you.

247
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,259
Warren, I have to talk to you.

248
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:39,304
Excuse me, General.
May I make a phone call?

249
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,225
- All right, but hurry it up.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

250
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:50,816
I'm trying to reach him now, sir.

251
00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:52,776
Yes, sir.
Hold on, please.

252
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,375
- Hello?
- 'Sheila?'

253
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,629
Oh, it's you, Warren.
I was in the bathroom, doing my hair.

254
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:15,340
I, er... want to look nice for you
this evening.

255
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,759
I'm afraid this evening
is out of the question.

256
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:20,595
- 'Can you tell me why?'
- No, I can't explain it now.

257
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,800
- 'I was looking forward to...'
- My darling, listen.

258
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:25,308
I want you to do exactly as I tell you.
Understand?

259
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,143
Perfectly.

260
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:30,897
I will do what you wish
and not ask why.

261
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:35,944
- A typical male chauvinist pig attitude.
- 'This is serious. Don't kid around.'

262
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:39,865
Make sure all doors and windows
are locked. Nobody is to be let in!

263
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,450
Nobody, understand?
I'll be home as soon as I can.

264
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:45,245
And when I get there,
you're to make damn sure it's me!

265
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,914
- 'Clear?'
- Yes. Transparent.

266
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,834
Have you become insanely jealous,
all of a sudden?

267
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:53,253
Think whatever you want to think,

268
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,589
but for God's sake, Sheila,
do what I tell you!

269
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,633
OK.

270
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,655
City Polyclinic, may I help you?

271
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,408
Will you hold the line, please?

272
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,912
Dr Miller is wanted on the telephone.

273
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:53,415
It's for you, Dr Miller.
It's your husband.

274
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:58,378
Tell him I'm very busy.
He can call again later.

275
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:03,925
I'm sorry, sir, but Dr Miller is about
to go into the operating room.

276
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,178
- Please would you call again later?
- I must speak with her now.

277
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:10,348
- It's urgent...
- 'I'm sorry, sir, but I can't disturb her now'.

278
00:34:10,473 --> 00:34:13,101
I see. Thank you.

279
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,396
Oh!

280
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:31,536
Jessica, what are you doing?

281
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:33,747
We're supposed to be leaving
for the weekend!

282
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:37,208
I know, I know!
Is the camper all packed?

283
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,919
Packed and filled up with gas.

284
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,172
Now, who could that be?

285
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,382
Oh, well.

286
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:48,970
- OK. I'll get it.
- No, leave it.

287
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:51,723
Don't answer it.
It's probably some bore.

288
00:34:51,848 --> 00:34:56,519
Or maybe your father, who always wants
to know where we're going

289
00:34:56,644 --> 00:34:59,856
and where we're going to stop
and if we have enough money.

290
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:03,818
Oh, didn't you know?
Generals are fussy!

291
00:35:03,943 --> 00:35:05,987
And General Murchison
is no exception.

292
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,324
I really don't know why I married
Jessica Murchison.

293
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:12,285
It isn't even three months
and already you repent?

294
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,663
I'm a passivist.
You know I hate uniforms.

295
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:22,170
Good morning, madam.

296
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:24,798
Your father wishes you
to join him immediately,

297
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,925
- at Defence headquarters.
- He does?

298
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,303
- At headquarters? Why?
- I have no idea.

299
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:33,014
He tried to phone you,
but there wasn't any answer.

300
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:36,559
He says that you're not to waste any time.
I have a car outside.

301
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:41,898
- Why? Did something serious happen?
- Your father will explain everything to you.

302
00:35:42,524 --> 00:35:44,526
Maybe some kind of war broke out!

303
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:47,946
OK. You can wait for us in the car.

304
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:55,453
- 'Headquarters 79.'
- Hello. May I talk to General Murchison?

305
00:35:55,578 --> 00:36:00,208
- It's his daughter speaking.
- 'Yes, ma'am. Hold the line. I'll try to locate him.'

306
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,594
The line was cut off! Listen. It's dead.

307
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,889
Why don't we just clear out of here?

308
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:17,016
I don't like spending my weekend
with the general.

309
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,270
It's probably not important.
I could call him from a telephone booth.

310
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:25,150
Come on. Hurry up. We have to sneak out,
so that idiot outside doesn't realise anything.

311
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,985
OK? Let's go!

312
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,917
Aagh!

313
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:52,385
Give me your hand.

314
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:32,800
Dr Miller, please. I'm her husband.

315
00:37:32,926 --> 00:37:35,553
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Dr Miller is in the operating room.

316
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:39,015
She's assisting Dr Kramer
in a very delicate operation.

317
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,517
We have strict orders not to disturb her.

318
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:44,270
But I must see her! I can't wait!

319
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,398
Sorry, Mr Miller. Orders are orders.

320
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:49,609
'Dr Schreiber. Dr Schreiber, please.

321
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,905
'We have an emergency in
the outpatient department. Dr Schreiber.'

322
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:59,410
What the devil's going on today?
That's the sixth emergency in two hours.

323
00:37:59,535 --> 00:38:02,747
All right, all right. I'll be right down.
Hold your socks on!

324
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:13,841
Raise it. Up!

325
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,248
It's Whitey. Let him in.

326
00:38:46,082 --> 00:38:47,917
Come on.

327
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,840
Come on, Whitey.
Why are you standing there?

328
00:38:58,261 --> 00:39:00,388
Aagh!

329
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,577
It happened before I... Hm?

330
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,758
Hey, what's happened here? Get him out.

331
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:30,311
Unfortunately, they've just sabotaged
the south power station as well.

332
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:34,524
We have a team of engineers there,
but it'll take hours to get it working again.

333
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,275
With luck!

334
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:43,199
- Well?
- The lines are still down.

335
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:46,536
He has orders to bring your daughter
and son-in-law back here to headquarters.

336
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:49,205
- Thank you.
- General Murchison.

337
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:59,340
Gentlemen, the government insists
that we not dramatise the situation

338
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:02,677
or leak any news
that might cause public disorder.

339
00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:09,308
We can't conceal this from the public.
Why, it's absurd.

340
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:11,644
The government disagrees.

341
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,273
We'll have to try to keep control of
public buildings - barracks, hospitals -

342
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:17,275
as long as we can.

343
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,944
- After which...
- We'll be completely on our own.

344
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,531
You're right, Warren.

345
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:27,827
We'll simply have to declare
a state of emergency ourselves.

346
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,377
- We need more help.
- All right.

347
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:38,421
Easy, easy.

348
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:41,799
Take it easy.

349
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,053
Whoa, whoa.

350
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:50,641
Put her down there.

351
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:53,769
Another one here!

352
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:56,814
Dr Peterson.
They're coming in like flies.

353
00:41:56,939 --> 00:41:59,817
Come on.
We need all the help we can get.

354
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:12,288
Hold that light up a little higher, nurse.

355
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:15,041
Thank you.

356
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,545
What the devil are they up to,
those fools?

357
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,923
Why haven't they turned on
the emergency generators?

358
00:42:22,048 --> 00:42:24,300
Two of the generators
are out of order, Doctor.

359
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:28,221
They're starting the third. It'll provide just
enough current for us and the emergency ward.

360
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:31,807
- Have you checked the pulse rate, Anna?
- Yes, Doctor. Weak but regular.

361
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,477
Very well.
Continue with direct oxygen.

362
00:42:34,602 --> 00:42:36,812
Keep that light steady.

363
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,317
Ah! It's about time!

364
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:44,403
- Plasma's running low, Doctor.
- Huh?

365
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:46,447
Yes.

366
00:42:46,572 --> 00:42:49,659
Anna, would you please take care of that.
And hurry.

367
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:51,827
Yes, Doctor.

368
00:42:56,666 --> 00:43:00,378
- Yes, I do. I'll be right back.
- Quickly!

369
00:43:00,503 --> 00:43:04,215
Help! Help!
Somebody help us!

370
00:43:05,758 --> 00:43:08,469
Oh, my God! I can't breathe.
I think I'm going to faint.

371
00:43:08,594 --> 00:43:12,014
- Why doesn't somebody do something?
- Hey, out there!

372
00:43:12,932 --> 00:43:14,976
Open up this door, will you? Come on!

373
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:17,687
Help! Somebody, help!

374
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:25,254
No. Stay away, please.

375
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,426
Aagh.

376
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,822
Oh, please, God! Help me!

377
00:44:57,912 --> 00:45:00,331
- Help! Help!
- Anna!

378
00:45:00,456 --> 00:45:02,541
Anna! Where are you?

379
00:45:13,302 --> 00:45:15,388
Aaagh!

380
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,979
It's me. Don't be afraid.

381
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:27,858
- Oh, my God! Dean!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

382
00:45:27,983 --> 00:45:31,028
Oh, Dean. There's something.
It's terrible.

383
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:34,407
- You can't imagine what I've seen.
- Yes, I know.

384
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,118
Anna, come.

385
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,547
Have they gone crazy?
Jason, do something.

386
00:45:49,672 --> 00:45:51,424
Make them keep quiet.

387
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:19,201
Aaagh!

388
00:46:57,406 --> 00:46:58,741
Aagh!

389
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,506
Keep still. Don't move.

390
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:16,217
No!

391
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:30,314
Aagh!

392
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:42,386
No!

393
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,195
Let's try to reach the stairs.

394
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,162
Now!

395
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:17,296
- Get us out of here!
- My heart feels like it's bursting!

396
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:21,050
Why don't they hear us?
Somebody help us!

397
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:23,802
- Please, somebody!
- Let's not panic.

398
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:26,639
If we keep calm,
we can all breathe a lot easier.

399
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:27,844
The shaft has a lot of air.

400
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,767
Why doesn't somebody do something?

401
00:49:29,892 --> 00:49:32,061
These things have manual controls
on them.

402
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:34,813
- Why don't they wind us down?
- You're right.

403
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:38,525
Hey! Wind it down!
Hey! Somebody wind us down!

404
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:41,654
- Get us out of here, will you?
- Help!

405
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:45,115
- Somebody help, please! Help!
- Get us out of here.

406
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,327
It's all right. Be calm.

407
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:51,997
We're falling! We're falling!

408
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:58,003
We're gonna be all right now.

409
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:01,340
I can't believe it!

410
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,022
The ambulance!

411
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:04,361
Behind you! Look out!

412
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,306
Hey, George.
How about taking us down a little?

413
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:09,968
Air Force 7 to Base 2.
Air Force 7 to Base 2.

414
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:15,766
We're at coordinate B. So far, we've had
no trace of the invaders on this side.

415
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:19,603
There's only an ambulance heading
out of town. I'll continue on recon.

416
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:25,818
- Continue as you are.
- 'I'm trying to.'

417
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,127
Any news of your family?

418
00:52:43,252 --> 00:52:45,129
No, none.

419
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:48,590
- I only hope they're all right.
- I'm sorry, Murchison. Really I am.

420
00:52:49,508 --> 00:52:51,343
Thank you.

421
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:55,430
Well, the situation is hopeless.

422
00:52:56,849 --> 00:53:01,854
Many parts of the country are cut off.
Most telephone lines are out.

423
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:05,524
What's worse, we've lost contact
with government headquarters.

424
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,861
We'll have to declare
a state of emergency ourselves.

425
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:11,488
- But, you realise...
- I'm fully aware of the consequences.

426
00:53:11,613 --> 00:53:15,367
- I just see no alternative.
- I understand. What are your orders?

427
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:24,084
Please notify bases 112 and 401
to stand by with helicopters

428
00:53:24,209 --> 00:53:27,546
and, if necessary,
squadrons of fighter bombers.

429
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:31,842
We've got to get control back at once,
before it's too late.

430
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:35,762
Or before we all become contaminated,
just like them.

431
00:53:46,565 --> 00:53:49,276
'...has declared
a state of martial law.

432
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:52,946
'All civilians have been ordered

433
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:57,701
'or to place themselves under the direct
protection of the police or the military.

434
00:53:57,826 --> 00:54:01,330
'Private traffic may circulate
only if authorised by...'

435
00:54:02,497 --> 00:54:05,500
It's frightening.
How could a thing like this happen?

436
00:54:06,627 --> 00:54:10,088
It's part of the vital cycle
of the human race -

437
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:13,133
create and obliterate
until we destroy ourselves.

438
00:54:13,258 --> 00:54:16,845
Words! We're up against
a race of monsters.

439
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:21,642
Created by other monsters
who have only one thing on their mind -

440
00:54:21,767 --> 00:54:24,186
the discovery of greater power.

441
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:27,522
At least this time there won't be any
historical justifications,

442
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:29,816
if any of us survive.

443
00:54:29,942 --> 00:54:34,529
- Do you think it's possible to stop them?
- The infection is like an oil stain.

444
00:54:35,447 --> 00:54:38,075
And who knows how far the contagion
has spread now?

445
00:54:54,508 --> 00:54:56,718
'...grave danger of contamination.

00:55:16,863 --> 00:55:19,950
Jessica, stop that humming, will you?
It makes me nervous.

452
00:55:20,075 --> 00:55:23,829
Bob, what's wrong?
What on earth is the matter?

453
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:28,458
I just heard a news flash on the radio.
Something serious has happened in town.

454
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:32,629
- They've declared a state of emergency.
- A state of emergency?

455
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:36,008
- Are they crazy?
- I... I don't know.

456
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,969
It's difficult to understand,
but we should go back to town.

457
00:55:39,094 --> 00:55:41,179
But we just arrived!

458
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:45,392
I have no intention of giving up
my weekend. To hell with the soldiers!

459
00:55:45,517 --> 00:55:47,894
Listen, you're my wife and I love you.

460
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,940
I don't want anything to happen to you,
so it's better we go away from here.

461
00:55:52,065 --> 00:55:54,443
- Something doesn't feel right.
- Like what?

462
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:58,780
Like that continuous barking
without seeing a dog around.

463
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:01,116
And we haven't seen a car
since we got here.

464
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:03,160
In a place like this?

465
00:56:03,285 --> 00:56:07,080
Look at the road, Jessica.
Usually, there's heavy traffic.

466
00:56:07,205 --> 00:56:09,541
- It's all very strange.
- Yes.

467
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:13,420
It's almost ten.
They should arrive soon.

468
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:17,424
Let's talk with them. They should know
what's happened in town.

469
00:56:17,549 --> 00:56:18,842
OK.

470
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,060
Bob!

471
00:56:30,812 --> 00:56:32,356
My God! It's horrible!

472
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,400
What do you suppose happened?

473
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:39,571
There they are.

474
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:45,410
Martha! Martha! Are we glad you're here!
You can't imagine what's been going on.

475
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,496
First, Bob heard this news flash...

476
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:50,248
Say, what's going on? You two...?

477
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:52,626
Hey! What are you doing with that gun?

478
00:57:48,014 --> 00:57:51,017
Sheila! Sheila, open the door!

479
00:57:51,143 --> 00:57:54,062
Please, Sheila.

480
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:58,233
Sheila! It's me, Cindy!
Let me in, please!

481
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:05,740
Sheila, can you hear me?
For God's sake, Sheila, open the door!

482
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,162
Oh, Sheila,
thank heavens I found you.

483
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:12,998
I couldn't stand it anymore,
being in the house all alone.

484
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:14,249
Come into the front room.

485
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:17,085
Jeremy went off to work, and
the cleaning woman never showed up.

486
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,337
I kept hearing noises everywhere.

487
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:23,717
- On the roof, in the cellar, everywhere!
- Well, you can relax now.

488
00:58:23,842 --> 00:58:26,219
We're safe here,
at least for the moment.

489
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:31,266
- Warren is coming as soon as he can.
- My God, Sheila! What's going on?

490
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:34,728
I don't know. I really don't know.

491
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:36,646
Have you tried calling Gracie?

492
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:40,317
Her husband is with the department of...
something or other.

493
00:58:40,442 --> 00:58:44,029
How could I call? The phone
hasn't been working for three hours.

494
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,407
Are you sure?

495
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,956
Not working here, either.

496
00:58:55,081 --> 00:58:57,792
There must be a breakdown
at the exchange.

497
00:58:57,918 --> 00:59:00,462
Cheer up.

498
00:59:02,923 --> 00:59:04,925
Drink this.

499
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:07,552
I'm frightened, Sheila.
Really frightened.

500
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:12,224
On the radio, they said to stay home
and lock all the doors and windows.

501
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:15,602
I did it. I even barricaded
the coal hole to the cellar.

502
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:18,688
- What did you say?
- I barricaded the coal hole to the cellar.

503
00:59:18,813 --> 00:59:21,608
How did I manage to forget that?

504
00:59:32,786 --> 00:59:36,206
Wait, Sheila! Don't leave me alone!
I'll come with you!

505
01:00:11,283 --> 01:00:14,119
Thanks for reminding me!

506
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:16,663
Be quiet.

507
01:00:18,832 --> 01:00:21,793
Light a candle and stay down here.

508
01:02:02,936 --> 01:02:04,729
Sheila?

509
01:02:14,155 --> 01:02:15,699
Sheila?

510
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:17,409
Sheila!

511
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:39,616
- They weren't even curious.
- We have a red cross protecting us.

512
01:03:39,741 --> 01:03:42,911
What is it, Dean?

513
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:45,038
Damn! We're running out of gas.

514
01:03:47,832 --> 01:03:49,083
There.

515
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:32,377
Anybody here?

516
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,217
Anna? You can get out,
there's nobody here.

517
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:24,053
Looks like they left a little while ago.

518
01:05:34,022 --> 01:05:35,648
Ah!

519
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:42,864
- What do you think about this?
- It's not really you.

520
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:45,241
But it's better than that.

521
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:55,585
Just like a Western.

522
01:05:56,628 --> 01:06:01,633
Except that they didn't have
instant coffee in the "good old days".

523
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:05,511
Another advantage
of civilisation, my dear.

524
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:09,766
Like Coca-Cola or nuclear energy.

525
01:06:09,891 --> 01:06:12,936
We'd be a whole lot healthier
without all that stuff.

526
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,855
Hm. This is good.

527
01:06:16,981 --> 01:06:20,151
Do you think we should give up
the advantages that we have gained?

528
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:25,365
Maybe it would be better. However, it is
not the fault of science and technology.

529
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:29,744
But of man,
nature's own human element.

530
01:06:29,869 --> 01:06:31,704
We haven't reached
the age of the robot yet.

531
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:33,998
This mess could have been avoided.

532
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:37,293
- Yes, but for how long?
- I don't know.

533
01:06:37,418 --> 01:06:41,506
But one thing is clear -
we're partly to blame ourselves.

534
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:46,844
Just think of the lives that we have led,
up until today.

535
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:52,725
Shut up in those ridiculous cities,
in a steel and concrete jungle,

536
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:54,936
like machines.

537
01:06:55,853 --> 01:07:00,233
- This had to happen to realise the truth.
- Let's hope it isn't too late.

538
01:07:02,402 --> 01:07:04,529
'...have special
commando units positioned

539
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:07,281
'at all strategic points
in and around the city,

540
01:07:07,407 --> 01:07:10,952

547

Anna, my love,
it's better we start moving.

548
01:07:33,975 --> 01:07:36,394
Get all the provisions you can
from the back room.

549
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,772
I'll get the gas.

550
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:17,560
Dean!

551
01:08:20,813 --> 01:08:24,108
They're here outside.
I saw them, Dean. I saw them.

552
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:54,806
It won't hold them for long.

553
01:09:24,335 --> 01:09:27,046
Find something, something like cotton.

554
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:43,980
- Here.
- Perfect.

555
01:09:48,192 --> 01:09:50,319
Let's hope this works.

556
01:09:59,537 --> 01:10:02,915
They're all together.
When I say "now", you open the door.

557
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,419
- But Dean, I can't...
- Listen! Do what I say. Don't argue!

558
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:09,130
All right.

559
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:11,007
NOW!

560
01:10:22,435 --> 01:10:24,187
Let's go.

561
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,886
- Do you want some more?
- No.

562
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:01,015
Don't give in.

563
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,768
We'll find a way out. Hang on.

564
01:11:04,769 --> 01:11:07,063
I'm tired, really tired.

565
01:11:07,188 --> 01:11:09,482
And I'm frightened.

566
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:13,778
We'll never get away from these monsters.
Oh, Dean, what are we going to do?

567
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:17,323
All right. Nothing's going to happen,
as long as we stay together.

568
01:11:17,448 --> 01:11:18,991
I promise you.

569
01:11:19,116 --> 01:11:22,536
What we've got to do now is
get away from here as fast as we can.

570
01:11:22,662 --> 01:11:24,413
Let go of me!

571
01:11:24,538 --> 01:11:28,417
Why don't we face it?
There's no place for us to go.

572
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:31,587
They're all around us,
butchering everyone.

573
01:11:31,712 --> 01:11:33,589
Sooner or later, we, too, will be killed.

574
01:11:34,465 --> 01:11:38,386
Dean, I don't want us to die. I don't want
us to die, but there's nothing we can do.

575
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:41,639
- They're all around us everywhere...
- Stop it!

576
01:11:44,684 --> 01:11:46,060
Come here.

577
01:12:13,713 --> 01:12:16,257
Run. Head for the woods behind you.

578
01:12:16,382 --> 01:12:17,425
Go!

579
01:12:30,896 --> 01:12:32,356
Get us down a bit closer.

580
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,179
They're all over the place.

581
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,781
Air Force 7 to Base 2.

582
01:13:21,906 --> 01:13:25,743
Air Force 7 to Base 2.
I've located a whole group of them.

583
01:13:26,494 --> 01:13:31,540
They are spread out around a mile
southeast of the Patterson-Hyde building.

584
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,795
They are moving
in a south-southeast direction.

585
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:39,882
Request immediate air assistance.
Over.

586
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:42,676
Base 2 to AF 7, message received.

587
01:13:42,802 --> 01:13:46,639
Will pass your request
to General Murchison at once.

588
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:52,061
Who's that, Reedman?

589
01:13:52,186 --> 01:13:56,607
Just listen to me, Reedman.
I'm not interested in your opinion.

590
01:13:56,732 --> 01:14:01,320
I know it's a huge risk. I agree with that,
but there is no alternative.

591
01:14:02,863 --> 01:14:04,698
Just carry out my orders.

592
01:14:04,824 --> 01:14:06,742
If necessary,
you can go to Chambers yourself.

593
01:14:13,374 --> 01:14:17,711
Hang on, Anna. We'll find some solution
in the end. I'm sure!

594
01:14:17,837 --> 01:14:19,839
You know there's no solution.

595
01:14:19,964 --> 01:14:23,008
All we can fight for is a little time -
but how much?

596
01:14:33,018 --> 01:14:36,313
Everything seems all right.
It looks peaceful.

597
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:38,315
Come on.

598
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:02,173
Wait here.

599
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,780
Wait! There's nobody here.

600
01:15:27,448 --> 01:15:29,617
- But I...
- I told you that nobody is here.

601
01:15:30,576 --> 01:15:31,911
Let's go.

602
01:15:34,413 --> 01:15:38,209
Let's go in. Maybe we'll find some help.
Remember the medieval legend?

603
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:41,962
If they're really vampires,
they can't enter the house of God.

604
01:16:01,565 --> 01:16:03,943
Ah! Thank the Lord, Father.

605
01:16:04,068 --> 01:16:06,278
We were really hoping...

606
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:41,146
So much for the theory of vampires.

607
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:08,632
Captain.

608
01:17:09,717 --> 01:17:11,343
What's going on around here?

609
01:17:11,468 --> 01:17:13,387
I've been on the radio
for the last half hour.

610
01:17:13,512 --> 01:17:16,223
Why hasn't someone responded?

611
01:17:16,348 --> 01:17:19,893
We located other infected areas
north of here along sector 29.

612
01:17:20,019 --> 01:17:22,229
So get those planes in the air.

613
01:17:23,063 --> 01:17:24,648
Well?

614
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:29,612
Don't just stand there. Answer me.
Or are you looking for a court martial?

615
01:17:29,737 --> 01:17:31,697
Don't move, Major, or I'll kill you.

616
01:17:31,822 --> 01:17:33,741
I'm not going to die like the others.

617
01:17:33,866 --> 01:17:36,452
You can't fool me, Major.

618
01:17:36,577 --> 01:17:40,623
You're like all the rest - contaminated,
bringing death and destruction.

619
01:17:40,748 --> 01:17:43,417
But no more!
I don't intend to die. I want to live.

620
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:46,253
Put that gun down! Crazy!

621
01:17:46,378 --> 01:17:48,380
You're calling me crazy?

622
01:17:48,505 --> 01:17:50,716
You're calling me...? I am not crazy!

623
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:52,903
Air Force 7 to Base 2.

624
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,782
Air Force 7 to Base 2.
This is Major Holmes calling.

625
01:18:57,324 --> 01:18:59,535
Gaden Airport is out of action.

626
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:02,162
It has been infiltrated and sabotaged.

627
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:04,623
Standing by for further orders. Over.

628
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:08,669
Just a minute, Major. I will pass you over
to General Murchison.

629
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,463
Here you are, sir.

630
01:19:11,588 --> 01:19:13,924
Warren, this is Murchison.

631
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,719
Listen carefully.

632
01:19:16,844 --> 01:19:20,431
All communications with operational
command units have been cut off.

633
01:19:20,556 --> 01:19:21,932
Can you hear me?

634
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:24,101
Variant B is out.

635
01:19:24,977 --> 01:19:27,896
Return to base.
Do you hear me?

636
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:30,149
Your mission is useless now.

637
01:19:30,274 --> 01:19:33,569
'Message received, General.
Will do. Over and out.'

638
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:40,784
Oh, Donahue.

639
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:44,037
I suppose you're here to tell me
that your experiment didn't work out?

640
01:19:44,163 --> 01:19:46,582
On the contrary.
The gas has proven effective.

641
01:19:46,707 --> 01:19:49,501
Our planes can fire it
with their missile launchers.

642
01:19:49,626 --> 01:19:52,212
We can begin at once, General.

643
01:19:52,337 --> 01:19:54,798
But, Donahue, we have no planes!

644
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:57,050
Not anymore.

645
01:19:58,177 --> 01:20:01,555
- And there's no more Reedman.
- Didn't he leave for the air base?

646
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,017
He never got there.
They brought him here 20 minutes ago.

647
01:20:16,904 --> 01:20:18,238
God help us all.

648
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:34,087
Wait here.
We're taking on a passenger.

649
01:20:53,774 --> 01:20:55,234
Sheila?

650
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:58,362
Sheila!

651
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:09,665
Sheila,
why did you leave the door open?

652
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:11,875
I told you to...

653
01:21:19,049 --> 01:21:21,468
No! No, Sheila. No!

654
01:21:21,593 --> 01:21:24,346
No! Sheila!

655
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:38,235
Anna.

656
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,988
Listen.

657
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:43,740
Forget all about that priest.

658
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,622
OK. I'll forget all about him.

659
01:21:59,631 --> 01:22:01,383
Look.

660
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:49,723
Eugh!

661
01:22:55,812 --> 01:22:57,981
Look at that! Maybe it still works.

662
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:01,526
Wait here. When I give you the signal,
run to the Jeep - fast.

663
01:23:01,652 --> 01:23:03,320
Yeah.

664
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:26,259
Run for it, Anna! Run.

665
01:24:25,777 --> 01:24:27,779
Hurry, Dean.

666
01:25:29,549 --> 01:25:33,178
Hey! Help! Over here!

667
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:38,100
Over here! Help!

668
01:25:38,225 --> 01:25:40,310
Over here!

669
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:51,279
Let's try to pull them out of there.
Hurry up!

670
01:25:51,404 --> 01:25:55,158
But, Major, is it worth it?
Maybe they're already infected.

671
01:25:56,034 --> 01:25:58,203
Just do what I tell you.

672
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,941
- Come on. You can do it.
- I can't!

673
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:34,656
A little higher. Come on.

674
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,744
Come on!

675
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:51,298
- I'm dizzy. I can't hold on!
- Don't look down, Anna!

676
01:26:53,925 --> 01:26:55,719
You can do it. Come on!

677
01:26:57,846 --> 01:27:00,182
Don't let go, Anna!

678
01:27:01,057 --> 01:27:03,894
- I can't hold on!
- Yes, you can, Anna!

679
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:19,492
What is it, Dean?

680
01:27:19,618 --> 01:27:21,620
What's wrong?

681
01:27:21,745 --> 01:27:24,372
Oh, nothing.
I had a horrible dream.

682
01:27:24,497 --> 01:27:26,208
A nightmare!

683
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:29,628
Anna, how do you feel?
Are you all right?

684
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:34,090
Yes, fine.
I just want to go to sleep.

685
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:38,428
God, it's late!
I have to get to the airport.

686
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,222
I've got an interview to do.

687
01:27:40,347 --> 01:27:43,308
That interview with the nuclear scientist,
Professor Hagenbach.

688
01:27:44,142 --> 01:27:45,602
I've read a couple of his books.

689
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:49,189
Now I finally get to meet him.

690
01:27:49,314 --> 01:27:53,318
Professor Hagenbach - important man!
Are you listening to me?

691
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:07,165
He hasn't arrived yet.

692
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:10,460
- Go find out what runway he's landing on.
- OK.

693
01:28:21,346 --> 01:28:24,683
Hey, Willy. About that unidentified aircraft.
He's heading in.

694
01:28:24,808 --> 01:28:26,851
Please identify yourself.

695
01:28:26,977 --> 01:28:28,561
Maybe his radio isn't working.

696
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:39,406
Declare an emergency.
He's heading for runway 16.

697
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:41,531
Get everything off his path.
All right, let's move!

698
01:28:59,509 --> 01:29:02,679
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know, but it looks interesting.

699
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:04,848
Let's see.

700
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:35,337
- What's the story?
- Nobody answers, sir.

701
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:39,716
This is the police. You want to
come outwith your hands in the air.
