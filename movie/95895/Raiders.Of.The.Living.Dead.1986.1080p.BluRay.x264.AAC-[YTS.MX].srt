00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:51,045
Armed suspect, hijacked Mill Run tanker,

33
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,671

- [Officer] Get those
SWAT men down here fast.

43
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,579
Yeah, with the electric stun gun.

44
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,207
- [Radio] Time check, 5:07.

45
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,889
- Yeah, this is Randall.

46
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:49,890
Here it is.

47
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,725
The man's some kind of a terrorist.

48
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:54,561
He's holding the people at the
Mill Run nuclear power plant

49
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,564
hostage until state prison
releases a group of convicts

50
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:58,607
on his list.

51
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:00,109
Whole thing's been hushed up till now,

52
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:03,112
but the police are starting
to cordon off the area.

53
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:06,907
And I think he may have some
kind of explosive device.

54
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,703
Yeah, I'm aware of what
happens if he blows it.

55
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:13,372
And you're close enough
to hear about it, too.

56
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:15,624
I'll call you back when
I get some more details.

57
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,549

(electricity buzzing)
(man screaming)

72
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:00,802
- School okay today?

73
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:02,512
- Sure, fine.

74
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:03,972
- I don't know how you
can do your homework

75
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:07,059
with all this rock music
and still get good grades.

76
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,394
- Yeah, it helps me
relax. It helps me work.

77
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:11,688
- Oh, I got a letter
from your folks today.

78
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:15,192
Your dad's special project
will be finished in five weeks.

79
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:17,069
Then you're to go home.

80
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,737
You know, I like having
you here, Jonathan,

81
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:22,449
but at my age, I also like
a little peace and quiet.

82
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:24,409
- Oh sure, fine. Just ask.

83
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,580
- I took my LaserDisc player
back to the video store today

84
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,417
and they wanted to
charge me $175 to fix it.

85
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,044
I told them to forget it.

86
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:36,797
You know, that's almost
as much as I paid for it.

87
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:40,133
- Well, why don't you
let me take a look at it?

88
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,427
- Well, I've got nothing to lose.

89
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:49,226
(tense music)

90
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,896
(machine beeping)

91
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:58,420
(rock music)

92
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:21,651
- Hey, Felix.

93
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:25,322
(Felix squeaks)

94
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:29,409
Hmm, let's see what this is.

95
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:35,248
Here we go.

96
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:39,711
This is good, Felix.

97
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:40,545
You'll like this.

98
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:42,172
Warning, high voltage.

99
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:45,759
Removal of cover exposes
hazardous voltages.

100
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,219
I gotta use that.

101
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,638
(rock music)

102
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:00,649
(Felix squeaking)

103
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:09,324
(Felix munching on snacks)

104
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,473
(rock music continues)

105
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:38,520
(wire snapping)

106
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:47,362
(lively music)

107
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:01,186
(loud electrical beep)

108
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:03,563
Oh, damn, Felix!

109
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,481
- Something wrong?

110
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:06,733
- Yeah, it's Felix. I think I killed him!

111
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,942
- Why'd you do that?

112
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,361
Was it an experiment?

113
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:10,570
- Yeah, sort of.

114
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,656
But it wasn't supposed to happen that way.

115
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:15,075
- You're a dangerous man to know.

116
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:17,077
Just what are you cooking up in your lab?

117
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:18,119
- A new death ray.

118
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,954
I wanna rule this block.

119
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:22,207
- All right, but stop at the corner.

120
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,709
My parents still think they're
running our house, okay?

121
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,628
- Look, Michelle, this really isn't funny.

122
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:28,129
I killed Felix with the laser beam

123
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:30,131
from my granddad's video player.

124
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:31,800
Look, would you stop laughing?

125
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,718
We gotta get rid of Felix
before my grandfather

126
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:34,969
comes home from his office.

127
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,347
He's not gonna think this is funny.

128
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:38,932
- All right.

129
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:41,559
Maybe you've discovered something.

130
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,479
Think you can use that
laser ray for anything?

131
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,398
- You may be right.

132
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:49,859
If I leave the amplifier alone
and just take the laser beam

133
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,153
and the circuits out, hmm.

134
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,406
Do you know any good assistants?

135
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,825
(rock music)

136
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:15,385
- I'm beat.

137
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:18,596
Got your fast film and high speed lenses?

138
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:21,057
- Yeah.
- Good.

139
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:23,643
This place is dark and it's
gonna be a bitch to shoot.

140
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,160
- What exactly are we covering tonight?

141
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:43,913
- I don't know, but I think it's something

142
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:46,040
that's really gonna make the story.

143
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,834
- Really make the story?

144
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:48,960
And you don't know.

145
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:51,796
How do you write those bylines?

146
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:54,466
- [Randall] Talent. Pure talent.

147
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,134
- And modest too.

148
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:58,803
- Hey, look, all I know
is what I've been told.

149
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:00,597
The last guy who went
poking around out there

150
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:02,474
didn't come back.

151
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:04,559
- [Shelly] And do the
cops know about this?

152
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,894
- No.

153
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:08,021
- Well, isn't it your duty to tell them?

154
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:10,064
- No.

155
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:13,234
My job is to get the story, that's all.

156
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,225
- [Randall] Just where are we?

157
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,685
We've been driving over two hours.

158
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:50,897
- Coulter's farm.
- Coulter's farm?

159
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:53,483
Are you kidding?

160
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:56,152
That's where they found
those mass graves last year.

161
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:57,529
- No, I'm not kidding.

162
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,407
If you're scared, stay here in
the car and lock yourself in.

163
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,827
I'll let you know if
there's anything to shoot.

164
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:05,578
- Unless they shoot you first.

165
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,252
(door slams shut)
(lock clicks)

166
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,216
(mysterious music)

167
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:03,887
(mysterious music continues)

168
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:26,159
(heartbeat thumping)

169
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:54,395
(mysterious music continues)

170
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,072

179
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:19,415
(car engine sputtering)

180
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:30,468

00:27:09,465 --> 00:27:13,302
(suspenseful music continues)

183
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,111
(heartbeat thumping)

184
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,028
(Shelly gasps)

185
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:40,246
(rain pattering)
(wind howling)

186
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:04,020
(car honking)

187
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:26,042
(car thudding)

188
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:09,001
(birds chirping)

189
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:14,423
- [Randall] What's your name anyway?

190
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:15,466
- Shelly.

191
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:17,051
Shelly Godwin.

192
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:19,220
- Mine's Randall.
- Randall what?

193
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,555
- Morgan Randall.
- Oh.

194
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:33,651
- Hey, let me in there.
- No, no, that's okay.

195
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:35,236
- Oh no, come on, let me do it.

196
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:38,364
- If you insist.

197
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:45,496
- By the way, thank you.

198
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:46,831
- Oh, that's all right.

199
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:47,832
- No, no, I mean it.

200
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:49,542
I really appreciate what you did for me.

201
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:53,838
- You look like a guy who has
a pretty interesting story

202
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:55,923
if a person wanted to cry.

203
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:57,258
- Don't.

204
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:59,176
You gonna be going to work pretty soon?

205
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:00,344
- Yeah.

206
00:30:00,344 --> 00:30:02,596
- Can you give me to ride into town?

207
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:03,431
- Sure.

208
00:30:04,682 --> 00:30:07,268
(synth rock music)

209
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:41,719
- Nice.

210
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:44,722
Nice, but I was looking for something

211
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:47,933
a little more inconspicuous.

212
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,477
- What for?

213
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:50,895
- What for?

214
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:51,896
What do you mean what for?

215
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:52,730
What the hell are you,

216
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,316
one of these big gun control people?

217
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:57,026
- The hell I am.

218
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:58,778
- It's getting so a man can't
even buy a gun these days

219
00:30:58,778 --> 00:31:00,946
without the damn do-gooders
and bleeding hearts

220
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,031
jumping all over him?

221
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:03,991
- That's true, but I
gotta look out for myself.

222
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:05,576
- I know, I know you do.

223
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:07,703
But a man's got a right to
protect himself, don't he?

224
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:09,413
He's got a right to protect his home?

225
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:10,456
- Not anymore, he doesn't.

226
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,583
Not with all these
liberals all over the place

227
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,542
infiltrating the government.

228
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,960
- It ain't safe to walk
the streets at night,

229
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,212
now it ain't safe to stay home.

230
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:18,339
- It's disgusting, that's
what it is. It's disgusting.

231
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:28,391
Now, if a man had something like this.

232
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:34,188
- You know, this is more like it.

233
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:37,316
- [Staff] You do a lot of hunting, do you?

234
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:41,195
- I've been involved in a lot of hunting.

235
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,739
You got shells for this thing?

236
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:44,824
- All you want.

237
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:46,992
- Good.

238
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:47,952
I'll take it.

239
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:19,692
- Have you known Ms.
Godwin long, Mr. Randall?

240
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,068
- Not very long, no.

241
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,279
- She seems like a very nice young woman.

242
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,613
- Yeah. Yeah, she is.

243
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:25,906
- I have a few rooms available.

244
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:27,032
Why don't we take a look?

245
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,117
- Okay.

246
00:32:35,624 --> 00:32:36,792
- Here we are.

247
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:40,254
- Oh, this is nice.

248
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:43,424
Yeah, this is a very nice little town.

249
00:32:43,424 --> 00:32:46,218
- Yeah, I've lived here all my life.

250
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:49,013
Sometimes seems it hasn't
changed in all that time.

251
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,765
Very peaceful here, Mr. Randall,

252
00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:54,018
if you appreciate that sort of thing.

253
00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:55,227
- Yeah, I certainly do.

254
00:32:56,812 --> 00:32:58,481
This room is fine, Mrs. Levitt.

255
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:00,232
- That'll be $45 a week.

256
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:02,276
$60 if you want dinner.

257
00:33:02,276 --> 00:33:05,070
(phone ringing)

258
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:08,240
- Hello.

259
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,202
Oh, hi. How you doing?

260
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,663
Oh, that's good, glad to hear it.

261
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:17,750
Yeah. Yeah, that is a nice place.

262
00:33:22,588 --> 00:33:24,632
Look, I think that we better get

263
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:27,051
something straight right away.

264
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:29,637
I'm really glad that I helped
you out and I'm really glad

265
00:33:29,637 --> 00:33:30,721
that you're feeling better

266
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:32,681
and you seem like a really nice guy,

267
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:35,643
but I just don't wanna get involved

268
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:37,311
with anybody right now, okay?

269
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:43,108
Yeah, I know this time, it's
only a date, but I just...

270
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:44,568
Well, I'd rather not, okay?

271
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,656
Well...

272
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,660
Well, my loss I guess.

273
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:57,331
No, no, I'm not mad you called.

274
00:34:00,543 --> 00:34:03,629
(laughs) You wanted to see what?

275
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:05,256
Oh, you're crazy.

276
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:08,676
Yeah, when I was a kid.

277
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:11,845
You know, but...

278
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,682
That sounds like it would be fun.

279
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:17,977
Yeah...

280
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:19,895
Well look, why don't I meet you there?

281
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:23,732
Give me about an hour.

282
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:24,567
Okay?

283
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:26,360
Good.

284
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,489
(playful music)

285
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:15,868
(playful music continues)

286
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:23,250
- A tarantula!

287
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,503
(performers screaming)

288
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:30,841
(screams)

289
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:33,636
(slap landing)
- What's the matter with you?

290
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:38,349
(gunshots blasting)
- [Actor] I killed it!

291
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:39,933
- [Actor] Stand back,
it's liable to bite you.

292
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:42,603
Tarantula?

293
00:35:42,603 --> 00:35:44,104
Shot fight holes in a divot.

294
00:35:44,104 --> 00:35:45,773
(handslap)
Get at it, go on.

295
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:50,110
- Do you really know what
you're doing, Jonathan?

296
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,738
I don't mind donating my
video player to science,

297
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:55,032
but I'd hate to see you get hurt with it.

298
00:35:55,032 --> 00:35:56,992
- No, I won't get hurt.
This is really great!

299
00:35:56,992 --> 00:35:59,578
You see the voltage is
multiplied here and produces

300
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:01,997
the laser beam in this
part of the circuit.

301
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:03,666
It's this fabulous optical unit,

302
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,584
which can be adjusted to focus the beam

303
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:07,252
for the proper target distance.

304
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:10,339
In this case, the video
disk is the target.

305
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:13,133
- Well, I'm happy you're
so enthused about it.

306
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:15,678
Look, I'll be leaving for
my office in a few minutes,

307
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:17,012
so I'll see you later.

308
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:19,348
And please, don't burn the house down.

309
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:20,808
- (chuckles) I promise.

310
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:25,646
(mysterious music)

311
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,876
- Hey, babe, what do you
got in the box there?

312
00:36:47,876 --> 00:36:49,253
How you doing?

313
00:36:49,253 --> 00:36:50,421
Hey, I am talking to you.

314
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:51,922
- Slow down.
- We wanna talk.

315
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:53,382
- Come here, how you doing?

316
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:55,342
- Hey, I'm talking to you.

317
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:57,052
Hey, what's in the box?
(electronic beeping)

318
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:59,972
(men screaming)
(car speeds off)

319
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:03,225
(light rock music)

320
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:05,519
- What's the matter?

321
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,855
- I was almost attacked.
- Where? How?

322
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:09,106
- Right downstairs.

323
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,274
I...

324
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:11,483
Did you save me?

325
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:12,776
- Oh, is that what happened?

326
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:14,987
I went to do some target
practice on the garbage cans

327
00:37:14,987 --> 00:37:15,863
and I missed.

328
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:17,239
I heard somebody scream.

329
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,825
- You shot one of them.
- How badly?

330
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:22,911
- I don't know. Maybe you
just burned them a little.

331
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:25,664
- You had me worried.
One murder was enough.

332
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:26,874
- Are you sure you know what you're doing

333
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:28,167
with this experiment?

334
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,501
- Everything's okay.

335
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:31,670
All I had to do was put
a new optical system in.

336
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,797
Now I can focus over long distances.

337
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:35,716
Did you bring your
family's video player over?

338
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:38,051
- Yeah, but I feel like a thief.

339
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:39,678
- They won't miss it.

340
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:40,721
- Alright.

341
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:42,222
- Look, after what's happened tonight,

342
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:45,309
you can see there's a
good use for this device.

343
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:53,192
(suspenseful music)

344
00:38:30,187 --> 00:38:31,271
(heartbeat thumping)

345
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:33,774
(door crashes down)

346
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:36,485
(gunshot firing)

347
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:43,700
(suspenseful music continues)

348
00:38:48,372 --> 00:38:51,124
(gunshot firing)

349
00:38:58,257 --> 00:38:59,800
(gunshot firing)

350
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:12,020
(horn blowing)

351
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:18,735
(bells ringing)

352
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:28,954
(suspenseful music)

353
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:48,473
- [Doctor] Are you all right?

354
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:52,019
Do you need help?

355
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:55,147
- No, I just need some rest.

356
00:39:55,147 --> 00:39:57,357
- I'm a doctor. Come with me.

357
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,156
Take a seat.

358
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:09,077
Are you from this area?

359
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:12,205
- No, Fairfield.

360
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:15,000
- Oh, quite away from home, eh?

361
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,835
My name is Dr. Carstairs.

362
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:18,128
What's your name?

363
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:19,755
- Morgan Randall.

364
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:21,089
- Guess you had a pretty good night out

365
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:22,674
on the town last night, eh?

366
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:27,846
- No, but I could use a drink now.

367
00:40:27,846 --> 00:40:29,056
You got any?

368
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:30,182
- Sure.

369
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:32,059
Just what the doctor ordered.

370
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:32,893
Coffee.

371
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:37,648
- Cream or sugar?

372
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:39,358
- Nothing, thanks.

373
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,485
- Well, I take both.

374
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:43,403
Don't like it too strong.

375
00:40:46,865 --> 00:40:49,117
You know, I sometimes come
back to my office at night

376
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:51,161
to do some paperwork when it's quiet,

377
00:40:53,205 --> 00:40:55,374
but nothing too important tonight.

378
00:40:58,126 --> 00:40:59,795
Wanna talk about anything?

379
00:40:59,795 --> 00:41:01,171
I've got plenty of time.

380
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:13,809
- Look, I'm grateful for your help, but...

381
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:16,895
- Are you in any kind of trouble?

382
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,483
Want me to call the police?

383
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:22,317
- No.

384
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,070
No.

385
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,655
- Then, can I be of any help?

386
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:31,159
- It's a crazy world we live in.

387
00:41:33,161 --> 00:41:35,580
There's a lot of strange
people around out there.

388
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,712
I started in on this story
about three months ago.

389
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:45,465
(mysterious music)

390
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,556
- Detective Kruger.
- Shelly, thanks for coming.

391
00:41:52,556 --> 00:41:54,182
- Yeah.

392
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:55,934
What's happened?

393
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:57,978
- Mrs. Levitt said you
knew a man staying here

394
00:41:57,978 --> 00:41:59,813
by the name of Morgan Randall.

395
00:41:59,813 --> 00:42:01,440
- Yeah, that's right,

396
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,443
but we only met this morning.

397
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:07,070
- Do you know anything about him at all?

398
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,447
- Not too much.

399
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:10,782
It's kinda strange.

400
00:42:10,782 --> 00:42:13,869
He was hitching a ride into town and a car

401
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:17,414
almost ran him over, so I
stopped to help him out.

402
00:42:17,414 --> 00:42:20,751
He was in pretty bad shape, but
it wasn't from the accident.

403
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:24,004
So I cleaned him up a
little bit, and that's that.

404
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:26,506
Except for a movie this evening.

405
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:27,883
- That's it?

406
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:29,051
- Yeah, just about.

407
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:32,596
What's this all about?

408
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:37,350
- Come on upstairs. I
want you to see something.

409
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:42,939
(suspenseful music)

410
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:46,777
- Shelly.
- Dr. Kapek.

411
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:47,944
- Tell her.

412
00:42:47,944 --> 00:42:48,862
- Oh.

413
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,574
I don't offer any explanation for it.

414
00:42:52,574 --> 00:42:54,409
All I can do is tell you what I see.

415
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,998
This man has been dead
for a good two years.

416
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:04,878
- I don't understand.

417
00:43:04,878 --> 00:43:06,046
- Welcome to the club.

418
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,097
- I feel much better
after the coffee, cleanup,

419
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:17,724
and just having somebody to talk to.

420
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:20,143
- What you have to say is fantastic,

421
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:21,895
but I can see why you
can't go to the police

422
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:23,021
with that kind of tale.

423
00:43:23,063 --> 00:43:24,106
- Exactly.

424
00:43:24,106 --> 00:43:25,482
- I'll get you something to eat

425
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:27,859
and you'll stay with us tonight.

426
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:31,446
I'm not so sure that your
story is as crazy as it sounds.

427
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:32,906
You may have seen something,

428
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:35,534
but not the zombies you imagine.

429
00:43:35,534 --> 00:43:38,745
- Oh no, not another one.
- Another what?

430
00:43:38,745 --> 00:43:40,455
- Unexpected guest.

431
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:42,499
My grandfather's a people collector.

432
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:44,292
I don't know where he digs them up.

433
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:48,046
- Jonathan, come in here.
I want you to meet someone.

434
00:43:48,046 --> 00:43:49,673
- Okay, grandpa.

435
00:43:49,673 --> 00:43:50,924
Come on. Keep me company.

436
00:43:58,473 --> 00:44:00,350
- Jonathan, this is Mr. Randall.

437
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,811
He's a newspaper reporter
and he's stranded here,

438
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:04,688
so I figured we could help him out.

439
00:44:04,688 --> 00:44:07,399
Mr. Randall, this is my grandson, Jonathan

440
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:08,775
and his friend Michelle.

441
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:09,943
- Could you excuse us, Grandpa?

442
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:12,654
We have some work to finish.
- Oh, not tonight, you don't.

443
00:44:12,654 --> 00:44:13,947
As soon as we're finished eating,

444
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:15,240
we're gonna drive Michelle home

445
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,117
and we're all gonna get some rest.

446
00:44:17,117 --> 00:44:18,827
After a good night's sleep, Mr. Randall,

447
00:44:18,827 --> 00:44:21,621
I think it might be wise for
you to leave town tomorrow.

448
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:25,959
- Go home, Shelly.

449
00:44:31,923 --> 00:44:34,926
If there was anything you could
do, it would be different.

450
00:44:34,968 --> 00:44:36,595
- Hmm.

451
00:44:36,595 --> 00:44:39,389
- You're not worried
about this guy, are you?

452
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:40,932
- Oh, I don't know.

453
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:44,853
He just seemed hounded by something.

454
00:44:44,853 --> 00:44:47,147
He didn't say anything,
but you could feel it.

455
00:44:49,274 --> 00:44:51,693
I just can't help but wonder
what kind of bizarre situation

456
00:44:51,693 --> 00:44:53,361
this guy's got himself into.

457
00:44:54,946 --> 00:44:57,616
- Well, he's gonna be hounded
by us for a while now.

458
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:00,160
- Interesting point of law though.

459
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,704
The victim's been dead for over two years.

460
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:05,123
- The law covers it.

461
00:45:05,123 --> 00:45:07,792
(phone ringing)

462
00:45:10,128 --> 00:45:10,962
Yeah.

463
00:45:13,256 --> 00:45:14,925
Well, that's something.

464
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:16,551
Get on it.

465
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:17,385
Right.

466
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:22,349
- [Shelly] What?

467
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:24,517
- They found the car this guy was renting.

468
00:45:24,517 --> 00:45:25,936
Abandoned on the road to Hollis.

469
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,271
- Hmm.

470
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,232
- (snickers) Okay, Shelly.

471
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:32,359
You're officially off the force now.

472
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:34,778
Go home.

473
00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:35,820
Go to bed.

474
00:45:37,322 --> 00:45:39,032
- Let me know what happens, okay?

475
00:45:53,505 --> 00:45:56,299
(phone ringing)

476
00:45:57,592 --> 00:45:58,677
Hello?

477
00:45:58,677 --> 00:46:00,679
Morgan, are you all right?

478
00:46:01,554 --> 00:46:02,722
Where are you?

479
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:04,683
- Never mind about that now.

480
00:46:04,683 --> 00:46:06,977
I just called to let you know I was okay.

481
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:09,062
- Look, the police are
out looking for you.

482
00:46:09,062 --> 00:46:10,605
Where are you?

483
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:11,815
- I'm not sure.

484
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:14,484
I took the main road west outta town.

485
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:15,986
- I wanna talk to you.

486
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:17,570
- It'll have to wait.

487
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,239
Just take care of yourself, okay?

488
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:22,409
- The hell it'll wait.
(receiver clicks)

489
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:26,579
(lively music)

490
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,618
(lively music continues)

491
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:29,726
- What's the idea?

492
00:47:40,362 --> 00:47:41,571
- [Actor] Give me that hose!

493
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,411
- [Actor] Hey you.

494
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:51,081
(inaudible chatter)

495
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:54,042
Whoa.

496
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:57,837
- Shut that that off!

497
00:47:57,837 --> 00:47:59,381
- Wait a minute, I'll
have to tie a knot in it.

498
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:04,260
(gentle music)

499
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:09,516
- Well, here we are.

500
00:48:12,018 --> 00:48:15,063
I really appreciate you coming
out here to track me down,

501
00:48:15,063 --> 00:48:16,856
but you're asking for trouble.

502
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:20,777
- Well, I may be asking for
it, but you've already got it.

503
00:48:20,777 --> 00:48:22,695
There was a dead body outside your room,

504
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:25,407
and now the police are looking for you.

505
00:48:25,407 --> 00:48:26,408
What's going on?

506
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:31,037
- The police aren't the only
ones that are looking for me.

507
00:48:31,037 --> 00:48:33,373
That visitor didn't get there by accident.

508
00:48:33,415 --> 00:48:35,625
- Is somebody else chasing you?

509
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,459
Why?

510
00:48:37,627 --> 00:48:38,753
- I don't know.

511
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:41,631
- Who are you, really?

512
00:48:42,674 --> 00:48:45,260
- I'm a news writer from Fairfield.

513
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,428
I was working on this story

514
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:49,722
when I got involved with these things.

515
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:52,559
I know it sounds crazy,

516
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,894
but I think somebody's found
a way to bring dead bodies

517
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:56,062
back to life.

518
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:58,189
Why? I don't know.

519
00:48:58,189 --> 00:49:00,150
- You expect me to believe that?

520
00:49:02,235 --> 00:49:03,236
- Believe it.

521
00:49:04,154 --> 00:49:05,196
I've seen it.

522
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,824
- You're really serious, aren't you?

523
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:15,373
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

524
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:18,001
- Try and keep a low
profile for the time being.

525
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:20,086
- That makes sense.

526
00:49:20,086 --> 00:49:21,588
Do you have any proof?

527
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:24,591
- That's it. Nothing.

528
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:30,013
Wait a minute.

529
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,141
I found this the night it all started.

530
00:49:33,141 --> 00:49:34,726
I've had it in my pocket ever since.

531
00:49:34,726 --> 00:49:36,352
Any ideas?

532
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:38,146
- R.C.I?

533
00:49:39,314 --> 00:49:43,485
It looks like a piece of
a uniform or work clothes.

534
00:49:44,736 --> 00:49:49,032
Maybe from some kind of
a factory or institution.

535
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,494
Yeah, I don't know what it means.

536
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:55,163
- Any idea who would know?

537
00:49:57,457 --> 00:49:59,083
- Maybe one of the teachers
at the high school,

538
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,668
or the college?
(mutters) No.

539
00:50:03,129 --> 00:50:05,590
The Historical Society
keeps all its records

540
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,468
at the Wilson Street Library. Try there.

541
00:50:08,468 --> 00:50:10,845
No, you'd get spotted.

542
00:50:10,845 --> 00:50:12,680
- It'd be worth a chance.

543
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,057
- Okay, let's go.

544
00:50:14,057 --> 00:50:17,477
- No, you go home and keep
your nose out of all this.

545
00:50:17,477 --> 00:50:19,896
- Fat chance, I'm already involved.

546
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:21,231
- You better hope not.

547
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:23,483
Go home.

548
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:24,442
I'll call ya.

549
00:50:43,336 --> 00:50:44,796
(light switch clicking)

550
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:56,891
(suspenseful music)

551
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,686
(heartbeat thumping)

552
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:33,428
(suspenseful music continues)

553
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:16,929
(suspenseful music continues)

554
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:53,841
(suspenseful music continues)

555
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:45,435
(phone ringing)

556
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:01,033
(bell ringing)

557
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:04,162
(students chattering)

558
00:54:15,673 --> 00:54:18,676
- My grandfather and
Randall talked some more.

559
00:54:18,676 --> 00:54:20,178
- So?

560
00:54:20,178 --> 00:54:21,929
- Well, this Randall's no loony,

561
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:25,183
and my grandfather takes
him very seriously.

562
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:26,100
- About what?

563
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:29,979
- About being attacked by zombies.

564
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:31,522
- Zombies?

565
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:32,982
You're not making this up?

566
00:54:32,982 --> 00:54:33,941
- Nuh-uh.

567
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:35,818
I saw a special on TV about them once.

568
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:38,321
They have them in Haiti, the undead.

569
00:54:38,321 --> 00:54:39,614
Here, we have them in the movies.

570
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:41,491
There, they have them for real.

571
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:43,993
- Wow, and you actually
think that we have them too?

572
00:54:43,993 --> 00:54:45,495
- Could be.

573
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:46,996
- What can we do about it?

574
00:54:46,996 --> 00:54:48,414
Nobody will believe this.

575
00:54:48,414 --> 00:54:51,375
- I don't know, but we've gotta
try and help this Randall.

576
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,836
- Well, expert, you saw the show.

577
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:55,254
Where are zombies kept?

578
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:57,006
- Well during the day,
they're in their graves,

579
00:54:57,006 --> 00:54:59,175
but at night, they come
out, when nobody's around.

580
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:00,718
You know they work in the fields.

581
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:02,845
- So you think they may be
buried somewhere near here now?

582
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:04,305
- It might be.

583
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:25,701
(doorbell buzzing)

584
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:34,836
(doorbell buzzing)

585
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:42,260
(mysterious music)

586
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,891
- [Michelle] We don't even
know what we're looking for.

587
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,143
- [Jonathan] Evidence.
Something suspicious.

588
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:54,689
See? Over there, that grave's freshly dug.

589
00:55:54,689 --> 00:55:56,899
- So what? Somebody was just buried.

590
00:55:56,899 --> 00:55:58,317
- That may be evidence.

591
00:55:58,317 --> 00:55:59,861
Let's come back tonight and we'll see

592
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:01,696
if it's just a normal grave.

593
00:56:04,782 --> 00:56:05,992
You afraid?

594
00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:08,160
- [Michelle] Not if you
finish your laser gun first.

595
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,871
- [Jonathan] Okay, come back and help me.

596
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:11,455
I just have some adjustments to make

597
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,292
and then connect the battery pack.

598
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,013
(suspenseful music)

599
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,785
- Oh, anything I can do to help you?

600
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,288
- I'm looking for some
information on local history.

601
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:54,916
- Oh, you must be another one of those

602
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:56,751
colonial history buffs.

603
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:57,585
- I'm sorry,

604
00:56:57,585 --> 00:57:00,463
but I haven't come here to
study the colonial period.

605
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:01,297
- Okay.

606
00:57:01,297 --> 00:57:03,466
We have a card file and you can look up

607
00:57:03,466 --> 00:57:05,426
whatever it is you are interested in.

608
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:08,387
You're not from around here?

609
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:10,514
- [Randall] No, I'm from out of town.

610
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,975
- Oh, you're studying at the college?

611
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:16,395
- No, I'm working on a news article.

612
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:18,356
- Oh, you're not one
of those who come here

613
00:57:18,356 --> 00:57:20,775
to dredge up our past.

614
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:21,609
- No ma'am.

615
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:24,695
I haven't come here to write
anything uncomplimentary.

616
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:28,157
I'd just like to know what
the initials R.C.I mean?

617
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:30,409
- What do you wanna know about that for?

618
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,954
The whole thing's forgotten by now.

619
00:57:32,954 --> 00:57:34,372
- Well, if it's all forgotten,

620
00:57:34,372 --> 00:57:36,624
there's no harm in you talking about it.

621
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,960
- I grew up here.

622
00:57:39,794 --> 00:57:44,799
I used to see the R.C.I trucks
going out there all the time.

623
00:57:44,924 --> 00:57:48,844
- And exactly where was there?

624
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:50,513
- Well, the prison, of course.

625
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:53,557
- Can you tell me something about it?

626
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,601
- Yes.

627
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:59,480
They called it the Rockmore
Correctional Institute.

628
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,817
Some of the young couples
would go up to the top

629
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:06,570
of Lookout Hill and watch.

630
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,658
All the lights on the island grow dim

631
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:13,995
while a man was being put to
death in the electric chair.

632
00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:19,583
I watched once, made me sick.

633
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,919
- I guess it would.

634
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:23,963
- A lot of people were against the prison

635
00:58:23,963 --> 00:58:26,173
and what it stood for.

636
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:27,883
And then there were the bells.

637
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:30,344
- The bells?

638
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:31,387
- Early in the morning,

639
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:35,933
the jailers would ring
those horrible bells

640
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:39,311
to wake the prisoners
for some awful reason.

641
00:58:40,855 --> 00:58:44,275
There are some people who insist
they still hear them ring.

642
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:47,236
And the prison's been closed for 40 years.

643
00:58:47,236 --> 00:58:49,488
- What's become of the property?

644
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:52,533
- Oh, nobody goes near
Rockmore Island anymore.

645
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:54,201
It's not safe.

646
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:58,831
Town Council wanted to build
a children's park there.

647
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:01,584
But too many parents objected,

648
00:59:01,584 --> 00:59:05,004
especially after the scandal
that closed Rockmore.

649
00:59:05,004 --> 00:59:06,380
- Scandal?

650
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,760
- Yeah, the head doctor at
the prison used to perform

651
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,513
some terrible experiments
on the prisoners.

652
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:16,849
Even on those who had been executed.

653
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,478
The families could never claim the bodies.

654
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:22,521
That's what started the investigation.

655
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:24,023
- And what happened to the doctor?

656
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:26,984
- After a while, they just
stopped looking for him.

657
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:30,988
- Well, thank you very much, ma'am.

658
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,990
You've been very helpful.

659
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,492
- Helpful?

660
00:59:34,492 --> 00:59:36,827
Well, just don't come again.

661
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:37,995
Once is enough.

662
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:47,254
(lively pensive music)

663
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:25,459
(mysterious music)

664
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:32,842
- [Michelle] if anyone catches us here,

665
01:00:32,842 --> 01:00:33,843
and you've got this gun...

666
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:34,760
- [Jonathan] Stop worrying.

667
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,929
We've got more important
things to think about.

668
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:38,430
- [Michelle] I don't think anyone's here.

669
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,141
Let's go home and forget about it.

670
01:00:40,141 --> 01:00:42,268
This Randall was probably
drunk and your grandfather

671
01:00:42,268 --> 01:00:44,186
was only being nice to him.

672
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:45,312
- [Jonathan] Yeah, that's possible,

673
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:46,772
but what if his story's true?

674
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:48,774
Who else is going to do anything about it?

675
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:55,739
- Look over there in the distance.

676
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:57,783
See that light?

677
01:01:01,704 --> 01:01:03,080
Listen.

678
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,000
(mysterious music continues)

679
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,793
(bell rings gently)

680
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:13,340
- It's maybe Evans.

681
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,300
- Be quiet.

682
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:19,722
(insects chirping)

683
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,952
(loud heartbeat)

684
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:49,126
(suspenseful music)

685
01:01:58,052 --> 01:01:59,553
- Randall's not crazy.

686
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:00,512
Look at that!

687
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:04,683
(loud heartbeat)

688
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,819
(dramatic music)

689
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:20,699
- Here he comes, let's go!

690
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:21,825
- Wait, let's try the gun.

691
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:26,372
- Come on, what are you waiting for?

692
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:27,248
- It doesn't work.

693
01:02:27,248 --> 01:02:28,207
- Let's go!

694
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:31,919
(loud heartbeat)

695
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:36,465
(suspenseful music)

696
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:44,932
- Of all the unmitigated stupid things.

697
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,308
The two of you could have been arrested

698
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:49,645
at the cemetery or worse, much worse.

699
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:51,855
These are dangerous people.

700
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:53,691
We'd better contact the authorities now

701
01:02:53,691 --> 01:02:55,484
before anything else happens.

702
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:58,112
- I guess you're right, but
we were just trying to help.

703
01:02:58,112 --> 01:02:58,946
- Help?

704
01:02:58,946 --> 01:03:01,907
You've been spending too much
time with your experiments.

705
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:03,534
You've gotta forget these fantasies

706
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:05,160
and get out in the real world.

707
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,537
- Real world?

708
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:07,538
Is that what you call it

709
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:09,581
with all these creeps running around?

710
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:11,250
- Well, I guess you've got me there,

711
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:14,586
but this whole situation
is pretty unnerving.

712
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:17,715
- Doctor, I don't know
if Jonathan told you,

713
01:03:17,715 --> 01:03:19,466
but his laser ray really works.

714
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:22,011
- Did something else happen?

715
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:25,306
(phone ringing)

716
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:26,223
Hello?

717
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,226
It's Mr. Randall.

718
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:33,105
- It's the old abandoned
prison on Rockmore Island.

719
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:34,773
We're gonna have to do something.

720
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:38,235
- Well, I think we'd
better call in the police.

721
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:40,154
You can't try to do anything by yourself.

722
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:42,239
You could be walking to your death.

723
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:44,700
- But they may have Shelly
out there somewhere.

724
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:50,039
Whether you come with me or
not, I'm going out there.

725
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:53,500
- I may be nuts,

726
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,920
but we can't let him go out
to Rockmore island alone.

727
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,047
I'll tell you what,

728
01:03:58,047 --> 01:04:00,924
I've got my old target bow and
I'd like to get a better look

729
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,426
at your laser guns.

730
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:05,512
(lively music)

731
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:08,849
(phone ringing)

732
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:13,312
- Accident Security West.

733
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:14,438
Oh, hello, Doc.

734
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:19,610
But just ask, you know I
owe you more than one favor.

735
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,654
Uh-huh.

736
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:24,281
Rockmore?

737
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:25,407
His name's Randall?

738
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:27,493
Uh-huh.

739
01:04:27,493 --> 01:04:30,245
- I wouldn't ask for your
help, unless it was important.

740
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:33,582
Come armed, and be careful.

741
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:44,551
(rock music)

742
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:24,299
(rock music continues)

743
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,441
(mysterious music)

744
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:34,953
(mysterious music continues)

745
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:27,381
(mysterious music continues)

746
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:12,259
(mysterious music continues)

747
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:17,491
(zombie moaning)
(heartbeat thumping)

748
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:22,788
(man screaming)

749
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:59,241
(dramatic music)

750
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,785
(bell ringing)

751
01:11:04,598 --> 01:11:07,434
(heartbeat thumping)

752
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:11,688
(bell ringing)

753
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:18,445
(mysterious music)

754
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:10,455
(heartbeat thumping)

755
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:22,509
(mysterious music continues)

756
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,559
(bell continues ringing)
(heartbeat thumping)

757
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:12,434
(heartbeat thumping)

758
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:34,497
(mysterious music continues)

759
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,559
(heartbeat thumping)

760
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,761
- If you encounter any of these creatures,

761
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,721
always know that you can outrun them.

762
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:36,226
Now, I'm going off in this direction.

763
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:39,229
If you get into any trouble, just yell.

764
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:41,606
- Okay. Be careful.
- Oh, I will.

765
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:43,692
- Come on, Michelle.

766
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:45,276
And make every shot count.

767
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:47,862
I don't know how much power
these battery packs have.

768
01:15:11,177 --> 01:15:13,013
- It's Dr. Kapek, the coroner.

769
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:15,306
He's behind all this. I can't believe it.

770
01:15:15,306 --> 01:15:16,683
- Believe more than that.

771
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:18,935
We got in here, but getting
out is something else.

772
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:23,023
- Precisely right. Getting
out is something else.

773
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:27,485
Shelly, why did you have to
stick your nose into this?

774
01:15:27,485 --> 01:15:29,362
It's none of your business.

775
01:15:29,362 --> 01:15:31,239
- What do you mean it's
none of my business?

776
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:32,365
People are being killed.

777
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:34,784
Doesn't that bother you, doctor?

778
01:15:34,784 --> 01:15:36,077
- A little bit,

779
01:15:36,077 --> 01:15:39,539
but I've been attending
the dead for so many years.

780
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:42,959
Let's just say I'm reclaiming lives.

781
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:46,671
- And just who's your
little pal here, huh?

782
01:15:47,756 --> 01:15:50,467
- Oh, he's just a young man I helped.

783
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:54,846
He's become very dependent on
my particular medical skills.

784
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:57,015
- Oh, what a cozy arrangement.

785
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:59,184
- He supplies them, you revive them.

786
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:01,019
- Oh, something like that.

787
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:04,189
- So you went from
prison doctor to coroner

788
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:05,690
in one easy step?

789
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,942
- Not so easy.

790
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:09,944
There are always those curious ones

791
01:16:09,944 --> 01:16:13,615
who have to play investigative reporter.

792
01:16:13,615 --> 01:16:15,533
Professor Canaan from the college,

793
01:16:15,533 --> 01:16:19,287
young Lieutenant Michaels from
our own Police Department.

794
01:16:19,287 --> 01:16:23,500
And dear old Mr. Barrett,

795
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,836
but they never had a chance
to talk about their discovery.

796
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:30,924
You see, they're all out here now.

797
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:33,676
(triumphant music)

798
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:15,343
(heartbeat thumping)

799
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:22,267
(suspenseful music)

800
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:26,146
- Look, there they are.

801
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,814
And that strange guy's got a gun.

802
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:31,568
Maybe I could save
them. Here goes nothing.

803
01:17:43,913 --> 01:17:45,498
- Well, we're up here. What now?

804
01:17:45,498 --> 01:17:47,876
- We gotta find a way off this roof, fast!

805
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,463
(suspenseful music)
(heartbeat thumping)

806
01:18:36,883 --> 01:18:39,886
(heartbeat thumping)

807
01:18:39,886 --> 01:18:42,138
(electrical beeping)

808
01:18:51,147 --> 01:18:52,732
- Shoot. Shoot him!

809
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:57,153
(arrow whirs)
(lively music)

810
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:03,826
(electronic beeping)
(arrow whirs)

811
01:19:15,338 --> 01:19:18,341
(suspenseful music)

812
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,864
(heartbeat thumping)

813
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:30,705
(suspenseful music continues)

814
01:21:18,002 --> 01:21:19,837
(heartbeat thumping)

815
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:26,969
- Quick, let me try one of those.

816
01:21:41,651 --> 01:21:44,028
(electronic beeping)

817
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:20,773
Shelly!

818
01:22:21,983 --> 01:22:24,444
- You just don't give up, do you, doctor?

819
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:25,611
- Come with me, dear.

820
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:34,829
(rock music)

821
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:40,501
My colleague here has a
lot of explaining to do.

822
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:44,172
I hope what you have to
say is as interesting

823
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:46,591
as the lectures you used
to give at the hospital.

824
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,264
