这地方烂透了 杰克
Well, this place sucks, Jack.

61
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,730
不仅仅因为这里热的要死
Not only is it hot as balls,

62
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,090
更因为你无法分辨人们的好坏

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,420
但要是你想避免...
But if you want to avoid...

140
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,690
真没礼貌
That's so rude.

141
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,510
不敢相信他居然这样对我
Can't believe he just did that to me.

142
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,630
主管 如果你想要避免国际纷争的话
Chief, if you want to avoid an international incident,

143
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,820
就该在我需要自己人时派他们过来
you give me my guys when I ask for them!

144
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,100
当地冲突必须得由当地势力来解决 泰隆
Local faces need to resolve local conflicts, Tyrone.

145
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,180
在这个国家 我们是客人
We're guests in this country.

146
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,910
是不速之客 鲍勃
We're unwanted guests, Bob.

147
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,820
我们是间谍 你们是安保人员
We're spies, you're security guards.

148
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,330
你们的工作就是让我们远离麻烦
Your job is to keep us out of trouble,

149
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,350
而不是把你们自己搅合进去
not get into it yourselves.

150
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,850
那就帮我完成好我的工作 把我的人给我
Well, then help me do my job and give me my guys.

151
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,580
你的人最擅长的事情
Here's what you guys are good at.

152
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,310
就是健健身 还有一天五顿饭
Working out, eating five hot meals a day.

153
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,570
最不擅长的就是听令行事
What you're not so good at is doing what you're told.

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,080
五分钟之内把"黄饼"追踪报告给我
I need your trace report on yellowcake in five minutes.

155
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,870
核反应燃料重轴酸胺或重轴酸钠的俗称

156
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,510
马上就好
It's coming.

157
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,040
又称伊斯兰教法虔信者 伊斯兰极端原教旨主义组织 被联合国 英美等国认定为恐怖组织 美国认为其参与了大使馆袭击事件

158
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,040
路障是安萨尔阵线设下的
That roadblock was run by Ansar Al-Sharia.

159
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,080
这已经不仅仅是族群部落和自由斗士的问题了
It's not just tribal groups and freedom fighters anymore.

160
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,670
泰隆 如果你有可靠的情报 请写进备忘录
If you have useful Intel, Tyrone, put it in a memo.

161
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
你们住在这里
You guys bunk here,

162
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,570
但你们不是中情局的
but you're not CIA.

163
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,380
你们只是被雇来帮忙的
You're hired help.

164
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,970
本分点
Act the part.

165
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,140
我可是个有修养的人
Where are my manners?

166
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,220
杰克·席尔瓦 这位是倍受尊敬的基地主管
Jack Silva, this is our esteemed Chief of Station.

167
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,060
泰格 你家双胞胎还好吗
Hey, Tig. How are the twins?

168
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,620
- 超可爱 - 真可爱
- Crazy cute. - Cute.

169
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,150
今晚有行动
You have a move tonight.

170
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,650
不侦查一下吗 主管
No recon, Chief?

171
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,110
如果连我的要求都达不到
What makes you Special Operators so special

172
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,530
那你们这些特别行动队又有何特别之处
if you can't do what I need when I need it?

173
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,980
这家伙真有趣
He's fun.

174
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,490
真是有意思
Well, that was fun.

175
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,020
他喜欢摆出那副样子 就因为他有这权力
He gets his jollies pushing around alphas because he can.

176
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,420
在游骑兵学校时 我们也遇到过这样的指挥官
We had this commander back in Ranger school,

177
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,100
他是个货真价实的蠢货
he was a real cockbag.

178
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,560
所以最后一晚
So on our last night,

179
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,670
我和一个兄弟偷了他的贝雷帽
me and a buddy, we stole his beret.

180
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,810
全兵营里的人都"强暴"了它
The whole barracks chubbed it.

181
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,080
- "强暴" - 对 拿小弟弟蹭了它
- "Chubbed it"? - Yeah, rubbed our dicks on it.

182
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,890
美国军方于2002年在古巴关塔那摩湾海军基地所设置的军事监狱 最初的目的是临时关押拘留者

183
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,890
带头的之前是关塔那摩监狱的拘留犯
Leader was a former Gitmo detainee.

184
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,730
那些家伙通常是不记仇的
Yeah, those guys usually don't hold a grudge.

185
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,990
杰克 我是马克·盖斯特
Jack. Mark Geist.

186
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,020
叫我奥兹 很荣幸见到你
Oz. Pleasure.

187
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,440
抱歉老兄 大家注意 这位是杰克·席尔瓦
Oh, brother, I'm sorry. Everybody, this is Jack Silva.

188
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,270
这是我们第三次合作了 他知道该怎么做
It's our third contract together, so he knows the drill.

189
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,220
我们是在科罗纳多海豹突击队训练时认识的
We met training SEALs at Coronado.

190
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,860
你是怎么教"海豹"用鼻子顶球的
How do you get them to balance that beach ball on their nose?

191
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,930
太难了
It's tough.

192
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,170
我们这有三名前海军陆战队员 还有一位喜欢
So we got three ex-Marines here and one ex-Army retard

193
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,640
把自己下体到处塞的前陆军游骑兵
who likes to rub his dick on things.

194
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,680
我是克里斯·帕朗托 叫我坦托就行
Kris Paronto. Call me Tanto.

195
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,290
你好 我是泰格
Hey, man. I'm Tig.

196
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,090
泰格在这里待的最久
Tig's been here the longest,

197
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,870
他会带你尽快熟悉这一片的
so he'll get you up to speed on the area.

198
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,810
这是布恩 侦查狙击手 禅宗大师
This is Boon. Scout Sniper, Zen Master,

199
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,310
算是坦托的"监护人"
holder of Tanto's leash.

200
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,680
欢迎来到地中海俱乐部
Welcome to Club Med.

201
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,120
这里从六月起就进入旱季了
So it hasn't rained since June,

202
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,280
直到九月才会开始下雨
it's not gonna rain again until September.

203
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,530
你睡双人间 不跟我一起 因为我是管事的
You're double-bunked. Not me, because I'm in charge.

204
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,640
健身房烂到不行 伙食倒是不错
The gym sucks, food's actually good.

205
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,310
基地主管就是个二货
And the Base Chief is kind of a tool.

206
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,530
他今天是挺混蛋
Well, he's a dick today.

207
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,230
也许他只是想要顶新帽子
Maybe he just needs a new hat.

208
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,980
别鼓励他了
Don't encourage him.

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,400
别这样 他只是在做本职工作罢了
Oh, come on. He's a guy with a job to do.

210
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,790
他只想熬到退休 但说起他的话
He's playing his string out, but you talk to him,

211
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,730
鲍勃以前还是有些功绩的
Bob did some shit back in the day.

212
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,570
好了 杰克 这是白板
All right, Jack, this is the whiteboard

213
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,900
这块板将决定你接下来六十天的生活作息
that's gonna run your life for the next 60 days.

214
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,270
我希望你每小时都查看一次
I want you to check it every hour,

215
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,410
因为紧急任务随时都会有 比如说
because last-minute moves pop up every minute, such as

216
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,400
三小时后 我们就有一次任务
we're shotgunning it in three hours.

217
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,250
三小时 我接到简报后会通知你们的
Three hours. I'll let you know when I'm briefed.

218
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,570
这里原本是一处私家宅院
This was a private family compound

219
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,720
属于一名利比亚富人
owned by a wealthy Libyan

220
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,520
他在革命发起之后离开了
who got out of town after the revolution

221
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,590
把这里租给了中情局
and leased it to the CIA.

222
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,270
他很聪明
He was smart.

223
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,440
味道有点难闻
A little pungent.

224
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,690
一点间谍情报技术
A little spy tradecraft.

225
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,200
谁能想到美国人会
Who'd expect Americans to be

226
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,530
屈尊躲在臭气熏天的屠宰场旁边呢
hiding out next to a stank-ass slaughterhouse?

227
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,620
我们称之为"僵尸之地"
We call it Zombieland.

228
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,760
A B C D 四栋楼
Building A, B, C, D.

229
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
- 哈沙姆 - 在 长官
- Hesham! - Yes, sir.

230
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,050
来了 长官
Yes, sir.

231
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,380
谢谢 谢谢 长官
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

232
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,880
他人不错
He's a good man.

233
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,030
但有些人得防着点
But there's a few we got our eyes on,

234
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,430
所以要时刻保持警惕
so always stay strapped.

235
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,890
该死的孩子
Damn kids!

236
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,490
这里是浴室
This is the bathroom.

237
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,580
你睡这里
This is you.

238
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,330
我睡那里
That's me.

239
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,890
这个帘子就是防止
This curtain is meant to

240
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,080
你对我投怀送抱的 所以...
discourage you from spooning with me. So...

241
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,470
爸爸 你离开这里要去做什么工作
Daddy, what do you do when you go away for work?

242
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,600
就不能在这边工作吗
Can't you work here?

243
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,810
我们可以做树屋生意赚钱
We could have a treehouse business.

244
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,350
听起来很棒
That sounds amazing.

245
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,270
那我们就能永远在一起了
Then we could always be together.

246
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,360
你知道孩子们需要的不是树屋 杰克
You know, the girls don't need a treehouse, Jack.

247
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,200
她们需要的是你
They need you.

248
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,750
我只希望 你不会在某天醒来时才意识到
I just hope that one day, you're not gonna wake up and realize

249
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,740
你已经错失了人生最美好的部分
you missed the best part of life.

250
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,470
你们这些人都结婚生子了
You contractors are all married with kids,

251
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,370
但没有一个人戴婚戒 这是为什么呢
yet none of you wear wedding rings. Why is that?

252
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,670
我们的工作就是识人
Our job is reading people.

253
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
所以我们不能给任何人可乘之机
So, we can't give anyone an edge,

254
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
特别是可能会利用这一点的坏人
especially bad guys that might use it.

255
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,670
我知道你和泰隆的交情颇深 我就直说了吧
I know you and Tyrone go way back, so I'll be frank.

256
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,960
中情局觉得你们应该在这里 但我不觉得
The company thinks you should be here. I don't.

257
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,890
事实是 这里根本就没什么真正的威胁
Truth is, there is no real threat here.

258
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,890
我们为这些人赢得了革命
We won the revolution for these people.

259
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,080
而这里的枪支越多
The more guns there are here,

260
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,520
人们之间的误会可能就越深
the more likely there is to be a misunderstanding.

261
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,480
这是我退休前的最后一站
This is my last station before retiring.

262
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,360
我不想出现任何误会
I don't need a misunderstanding.

263
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,530
听明白了吗
Is that clear?

264
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,490
明白了
Loud and.

265
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,300
这是你们的通行证 还有两周花销
These are your credentials, two weeks per Diem.

266
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,330
要是我 我就赶紧花 班加西的局势瞬息万变
I'd spend them quick. Things change fast here in Benghazi.

267
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,620
美国间谍学校 中情局特工培训基地

268
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,860
我们这有"农场"培养出来的精英
We have the brightest minds from the Farm,

269
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,090
在哈佛和耶鲁受过高等教育
educated at Harvard and Yale,

270
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,300
他们干着至关重要的工作
doing important work.

271
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,420
你最好不要妨碍他们

Babe, I think I got to go.

411
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:56,980
那是泰吗
Was that Ty?

412
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,810
只是个集合口令 可能什么事都没有
It's just a muster call. It's probably nothing.

413
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,710
- 好的 - 抱歉
- Okay. - Sorry.

414
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,800
告诉孩子们 我爱她们 好吧
Just tell the girls I say I love them, all right?

415
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,900
我明天再给你打电话
I'll call you tomorrow.

416
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,240
我爱你 拜拜
I love you. Bye.

417
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,790
席尔瓦 和平时一样 你他妈又迟到了
Silva! You're fucking late! As usual.

418
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,070
格伦·道尔蒂 最近怎么样 兄弟
Glen Doherty. What's up, brother?

419
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,540
隆说你在的黎波里 有什么大事
Rone said you were in Tripoli. What's the occasion?

420
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,730
克利斯·史蒂文斯大使周一上午
Ambassador Chris Stevens is coming in

421
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,010
要从的黎波里过来
from Tripoli monday morning.

422
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,420
你那时候都到家了
Well, you'll be home.

423
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,220
不 我们三个人延期了
Not anymore. Three of us extended.

424
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,200
大使坚持要住在领事馆内
The Ambassador is staying at the Special Mission Compound at his own insistence.

425
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,260
我知道 我知道这很麻烦
I know. I know it's a problem.

426
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,430
但问题是
And here's the thing.

427
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,580
大使不是什么肤浅无知的政客
The Ambassador isn't some dilettante political appointee.

428
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,560
他是动真格的
He's the real deal.

429
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,860
虔诚的信徒
A true believer.

430
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,580
他是去那里赢得民心的
He's there to win hearts and minds.

431
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,200
要是住在官方上并不存在的秘密基地
Now, he can't very well do that operating

432
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,860
收买人心的工作可不好做
out of a classified facility that doesn't officially exist.

433
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
如果他整天在领事馆处理国家大事的话
If he's racking at the consulate with his State detail,

434
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,020
那能和我们扯上什么关系
then what fuck does this have to do with us?

435
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,130
他没有随行人员 只有两个安保人员
He's traveling with no staff, just a two-man security team.

436
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,710
那些人没有你们了解这座城市
Now, the State guys don't know the city like you guys do.

437
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,930
大使坚持要用当地司机
The Ambassador insisted on local drivers,

438
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,570
但在这一点上 我们争赢了
but we won that argument.

439
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,310
- 所以现在我们是司机了 - 是的
- So we're chauffeurs now. - Yeah.

440
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,210
训练有素的高薪司机
Highly trained, highly paid chauffeurs.

441
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,910
主管不会同意的 他什么都不想让我们做
Chief won't go for it. He doesn't want us doing anything.

442
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,060
他是不同意 但这是上级的意思
He didn't go for it. But he got outranked.

443
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,320
大使应该得到最好的服务
Now, the Ambassador deserves the best,

444
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,850
那就是全球反应人员了 对吧
and that's GRS, right?

445
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,490
那里 那些人
Hey. Right here. These dudes.

446
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,650
这就是上次跟踪你时 撞了拖车的人的房子
Bad guy house your tail van got towed to.

447
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,200
笑一笑 混蛋们
Yeah, smile, motherfuckers.

448
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,800
这里距离领事馆只有两个街区
It's just two blocks from the compound.

449
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,270
2012年9月9日 星期日 美国外交基地

450
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,540
好了 怎么回事
All right. Hey, what's the problem?

451
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,810
首先 让他们冷静下来
First of all, tell them to calm down.

452
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,860
各位 他妈的都小点声
Everybody, dial it the fuck down!

453
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,140
好了 怎么回事
All right, what is the problem?

454
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,850
是二月十七日旅 这些人真有趣
17 Feb. These guys look like fun.

455
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,380
不能罢工 好吗 回去工作
There will be no striking. All right? Get back to work.

456
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,080
如果你每天为了二十八美元
How would you feel if you had to

457
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,220
而不得不保护美国人
protect Americans at $28 a day

458
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,560
还要自备弹药 你会怎么想
and then bring your own bullets?

459
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,940
所以该把安保工作交给专业人士 对吧
Well, why leave security to the professionals, right?

460
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,400
先生们
Gentlemen!

461
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,290
欢迎来到别墅
Welcome to the casa.

462
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,300
这个月来参加丑胡子大赛挑错时间了
You guys picked the wrong month for a bad mustache competition.

463
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,780
几百块钱打水漂了
Hundred bucks on the line.

464
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,470
这个肯定稳操胜券
Got this one in the bag.

465
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,590
我是斯科特·威克兰德
Scott Wickland.

466
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,500
我是泰隆·伍兹
Tyrone Woods.

467
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,970
我是戴夫·乌本
Dave Ubben.

468
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,390
来吧 我带你们去参观一下
Come on. Let me give you the grand tour.

469
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,170
我能明白
I can relate.

470
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,890
这里就像凯撒酒店的大厅一样
It's like the lobby at Caesars.

471
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,150
- 我的天 - 太他妈棒了
- Damn! - Shit's bangin'.

472
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,150
让你忘却自己身处班加西
Makes you forget you're in Benghazi.

473
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,570
伙计们 我是亚力克探员
Hey, guys. I'm Agent Alec.

474
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,800
刚刚在门外和一群不上道的中东警察
Just dealing with some Middle Eastern Keystone Cops

475
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,550
打交道
out at the gate.

476
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,270
那些家伙经常大喊大叫
Those guys yell a lot.

477
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,040
你们这里布局如何
What's your setup here?

478
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,250
大使住的这半边别墅 属于安全区域
Our Ambo's residence in this half of the villa is the safe haven.

479
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,330
入口加固 防爆门
Forced-entry, blast-resistant door.

480
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,560
窗户上有安全围栏
Security bars on the windows.

481
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,510
里面是我们安全屋
Inside that is our safe room.

482
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,550
大使有实战经验吗
Ambo have any tactical experience?

483
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,010
没有 但他有我们
Nah. He has us.

484
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,020
院子占地九英亩 场地是三角形
So, it's a nine-acre compound, shotgun style

485
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,550
从这里
from here,

486
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,350
一直到后面结束
all the way to the back.

487
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,910
我带你去那里
I'll take you there.

488
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,500
在他的房间
His room links to

489
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,690
可以与华盛顿特区和的黎波里直接联系
State in D.C. and Tripoli.

490
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,440
- 这里是管控中心吗 - 是的
- That's the TOC? - Yeah.

491
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,280
那是后门
Back gate?

492
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,280
只有一条路 紧急出口
One way only. Emergency exit.

493
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,280
找了些二月十七日旅的人负责保安和监控
Got a couple 17 Febs on detail, cameras.

494
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,540
那里上锁了
It's locked.

495
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,890
除了冲锋枪 你们还有什么别的武器
What kind of firepower you guys carry other than assault rifles?

496
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,420
我们还有许多小型武器
We've got multiple small arms.

497
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,960
弹药位于酒吧后面的管控中心
And ammo in the TacOps Center just beyond the cantina.

498
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
这边走
That way.

499
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,130
就这些吗
That's it?

500
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,600
我以为每个大使馆
I thought every embassy

501
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,720
都有硬性的安保标准
had standard hard-target security measures.

502
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,970
防止汽车炸弹的路障 全天士兵巡岗
Car bomb barricades, full-time Marines.

503
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,470
本应是这样的
Supposed to.

504
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,300
这里不是大使馆
This isn't an embassy.

505
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,140
而是临时的外交基地
We're a temporary diplomatic outpost.

506
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,490
美国现在预算有限
Uncle Sam's on a budget right now,

507
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,600
所以 我想是不可能有往常的安保规格了
so I guess normal security regulations don't apply.

508
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,900
果然是政府的做事风格
Man, that's some real "Dot-gov" Shit, huh?

509
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,290
这里就像是我们的度假胜地
It's like our own little resort.

510
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,650
我不想说扫兴的话 女士们
I hate to piss on your party, ladies,

511
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,160
但五个拿着M4卡宾枪的人是远远不够用的
but five dudes with M4s is not enough.

512
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,130
前门的本地人根本起不到作用
The locals on your front gate are worthless,

513
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,180
周围防卫太弱
perimeter's soft,

514
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,810
整个院子就他妈是个狙击手的天堂
and this whole compound's a fucking sniper's paradise.

515
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,820
如果有人用重型武器攻击这里
Any big element gets inside here,

516
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,370
你们都他妈会没命
you guys are gonna fucking die.

517
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,660
说的真感人
Well, that's heartwarming.

518
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
什么
What?

519
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,940
无意冒犯
No offense.

520
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,420
伙计们 我们就在一英里外
Guys, we're a mile down the road.

521
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,460
如有有什么事情 呼叫我们
Anything goes down, you call us,

522
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,360
我派布恩来 你们就没事了
I send Boon, you're good.

523
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,510
保重 伙计们
Take care, guys.

524
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,950
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

525
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,850
他们两个的军事经验加起来最多就十几年吧
A dozen years of military experience between them, max?

526
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,520
这周肯定很有意思
Gonna be a fun week.

527
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,790
2012年9月10日 星期一

528
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,720
吉布提 请求重新校准扫描鹰无人机
Djibouti, request retasking ScanEagle.

529
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,050
收到 两个目标都已锁定
Copy that. I have eyes on both.

530
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,220
奥兹 狙击手掩护 就位
Oz, sniper over-watch. Get in position.

531
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,690
阿莫尔 你一直生活在这里 是吧
Amahl, you lived here all your life, right?

532
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,080
是的
Yes.

533
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,050
卡扎菲真的只雇佣女性
Is it true Gaddafi only hired females

534
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,880
保护他的个人安危吗
for his personal security detail?

535
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,650
是的 千真万确
Yes. That is accurate.

536
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,490
卡扎菲是个十恶不赦的混蛋 但并不蠢
Gaddafi might've been an evil asshole, but he wasn't stupid.

537
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,880
我讨厌这个环节
I hate this part.

538
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,050
准备了 伙计们
Here we go, guys.

539
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,430
奥兹 行动
Oz, let's rock.

540
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,290
我瞄准右面的那个皮包骨
I got the skinny on the right.

541
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,580
那我来搞定剩下那个疯子
Let me take the whack-out guy.

542
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,410
阿莫尔 让这家伙冷静下来
Amahl, tell this guy to calm down.

543
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,710
冷静 冷静
Easy, easy.

544
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,500
他让你们把武器放下
He's saying bring your weapon down.

545
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,060
他想要他的钱
He wants his money.

546
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,390
好的 好的
Okay, okay.

547
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,730
这是你的钱
This is your money.

548
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,200
阿莫尔 让这该死的家伙冷静下来
Amahl, tell this guy to calm the fuck down.

549
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,720
那家伙像发了疯一样

550
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,700
你的钱
Your money.

551
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,730
大块头
Hey, big man!

552
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,570
伙计 你好
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey! Jambo.

553
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,370
你知道"你好"的手势 对吧
You know the jambo, yeah?

554
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,990
别冲动
Come on.

555
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,700
好了 冷静 好吗
Okay, cool down. Okay?

Come on.

00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,170
那家伙差点就发疯了
That guy almost lost his head.

559
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,820
基地 我们没事
Base, we are good.

560
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,090
雇佣军都认得"你好"的手势
Mercenaries all know the jambo, Amahl.

561
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,330
他们不会出问题了
These guys are all right.

562
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,560
基地 我们看到很多俄国产SA-7防空导弹
Base, we're looking at a lot of Russian SA-7s.

563
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,500
让他尽量盯紧卡车
Tell him to maintain eyes on the truck as long as he can.

564
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,190
我们要找到他的藏匿地
We're gonna find his stash

565
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,110
然后用地狱火导弹将那里夷为平地
and we're gonna level it with a Hellfire.

566
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,960

574
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,680
久仰大名 大使先生

幸会 进去吧

576
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,590
在看到了穆尔西在埃及的一系列举动
So between what we see happening in Egypt with Morsi

577
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,670
穆罕穆德·穆尔西上任后造成了一系列的政治变动

578
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,610
以及叙利亚当前的动荡局面后
and the current destabilization of Syria,

579
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,860
没错 我们很容易想象出
yes, it's easy to imagine

580
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,920
在这里可能发生的一切局面
any number of scenarios playing out here.

581
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,600
然而 在我看来
However, in my mind,

582
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,960
若不将目前的情形视为机遇
our biggest mistake would be

583
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,200
将会是我们最大的失误
to not view this moment as an opportunity.

584
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,000
政府间的关系十分重要 这没错
Relationships between governments are important, yes,

585
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,890
但我们与人民间的关系
but relationships between people

586
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,400
才是外交的根本
are the real foundation of diplomacy.

587
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,610
作为美国人 我们的使命就是要
And I believe that it is our mission as Americans

588
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,170
帮助班加西人民建立一个
to help Benghazans form

589
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,890
自由 民主 繁荣的利比亚
a free, democratic and prosperous Libya.

590
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,330
好了 谢谢

到我办公室来 立刻
In my office, now.

592
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,230
不用道歉 我会去说的
Don't bother apologizing. I'll do it.

593
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,300
我不会道歉
Well, I won't.

594
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,730
因为这种自吹自擂的政治发展演讲
'Cause I've heard the rah-rah speech about politics and progress

595
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,220
我已经听过无数次了
a hundred goddamn times before.

596
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,550
那我就把你上报给上级
Well, then I'll write you up.

597
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:48,800
真贴心
Sweet.

598
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,750
主管 这家伙只睡了两小时
Chief. Chief, the guy's going on two hours sleep.

599
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,760
他昨晚有侦察任务
He had a late scout last night

600
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,240
今天一大早又出去回购武器
and an early buyback this morning.

601
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,100
没错 要买光卡扎菲的所有武器
Yeah, buying up all of Gaddafi's arms.

602
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,190
就和去沙滩上
Let's count the fucking

603
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,270
数清有多少沙粒一样不靠谱
sand particles on the beach while we're at it.

604
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,920
SA-7防空导弹也被称为SA-7"圣杯"

605
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,920
你从黑市里带回来的三十枚<u>SA-7防空导弹</u>
Those 30 Grails that you took off the black market,

606
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,070
相当于保护了三十架飞机不被击落
that's 30 airplanes that don't go down.

607
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,650
我受够你了 坦托
I'm so sick of your shit, Tanto.

608
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,360
如果你不能表现的专业点
If you can't figure out how to act like a professional,

609
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,470
还有十多个人等着接你的饭碗
there are 10 guys waiting to take your spot.

610
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,350
而且我相信
And I'm sure that

611
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,710
你应该很高兴继续回去当你的保险公估人吧
you'll be happy at home being an insurance adjuster.

612
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,820
这是最后一次机会了 泰隆
That's the last chance, Tyrone.

613
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,380
好了 全球反应人员
All right. GRS,

614
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,470
大使在市长办公室有一个私人会议
the Ambassador has a private meet at the Mayor's office.

615
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,580
所以我们要低调行事
So, we're looking at a low-profile event.

616
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,720
我们是来帮忙的 所以不引人注目就行
We're here to back up State, so just stay in the background.

617
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,050
大使进来了 戴夫 你负责右侧
Ambo's entering. Dave, take right side.

618
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,700
这是怎么回事 这是在逗我吧
Oh. What is this? You've got to be kidding me.

619
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,440
这就是所谓的低调行事吗
So much for a low profile.

620
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,670
妈的 谁让他们进来的
Fuck me. Who let them in?

621
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,090
美国为你们而来
America is here for you.

622
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,130
没错
We are.

623
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:17,180
这事 就是这些破事让我惹我妻子生气
This? This is the shit that pisses my wife off.

624
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,660
这里的任何一个人都可以射穿他的上衣
Any one of these people could klack off a vest.

625
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,150
至少那样死得快 兄弟
At least it'll be quick, brother.

626
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,350
别这么混蛋
Don't be an asshole.

627
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,540
许多国家纷纷涌现出来
A number of countries have come forth

628
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,160
提供贷款 土耳其最近也参与其中
and offered loans, most recently Turkey.

629
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,260
谢谢 先生们
Thank you, gentlemen.

630
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,230
先生 明天的事情说定了吗
Sir. Are we clear on tomorrow?

631
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,990
鉴于明天是911纪念日
I have been persuaded in an abundance of caution

632
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,630
我已经被警告过无数次
to remain inside the compound walls all day,

633
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,370
要在领事馆里呆一整天了
given the 9/11 anniversary,

634
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,330
所以不需要司机了
so no drivers needed.

635
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,860
晚安
Good night.

636
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,440
这些民兵 他们拥有的数不清的军火
These militias, they have unlimited firepower

637
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,600
而且他们之间可以协作
and they can coordinate.

638
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,090
你得尽可能的让他保持低调
You've got to keep his moves low.

639
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,370
是的 今天本来不该对外开放的
Yeah, it was supposed to be closed door.

640
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,790
但市议会中有人向媒体泄露了消息
Someone from the city council tipped the media.

641
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,460

646

希望他也能去我们那一趟
Wish he could do that at our residence.

647
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,840
我有安全许可
I got security clearance.

648
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,760
也许这周晚些时候我就能过去
Maybe later this week I'll come by.

649
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,270
先生们 我们在这里不会有事的

稍后再和你们联系 好好休息一天吧
Call you later to check in. Have a nice day off.

651
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,310

- How'd it go? - He's a rock star.

652
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,420
班加西的所有人都知道他在那
Everybody in Benghazi knew he'd be there.

653
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,990
等等 不不 就是这个 就是这个
Oh, wait, no, no. This is it. This is it.

654
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,280
到唐尼的台词了 等等
This is Downey's line. Hold on.

655

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,060
孩子们发现它喜欢吃多力多滋玉米片
Kid's discovered she likes Doritos.

683
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,340
没错
Yeah!

684
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,550
好了 没事
Yeah, that's okay.

685
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,020
你可以吃它 尝尝它的味道
You can eat it. You can taste it.

686
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,760
没错 小家伙 看看你的眼睛
Yeah, buddy, look at your eyes.

687
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,890
看看 他长得像谁
Look at that. Who does he look like?

688
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,010
什么
What?

689
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,720
我女儿喝酒了
Daughter's drinking.

690
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,120
你十五岁就开始喝酒了
You drank when you were 15.

691
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,310
小女孩可不该喝酒
Little girls don't drink.

692
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,280
迪士尼乐园 你们真幸运
Disneyland? How lucky are you guys?

693
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,520
- 你们等会儿骑什么玩 - 大怪兽
- What are you guys gonna ride? - Jumbo.

694
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,810
小飞象 不是大怪兽 是小飞象
Dumbo, not Jumbo. Dumbo.

695
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,710
艾米莉 你谢谢妈妈了吗 说谢谢了吗
Em, did you thank Mommy? Say thank you?

696
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,710
- 我们说了 - 说了
- Yes, we did. - Yes.

697
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,070
我觉得你们没说
I don't think you did.

698
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,920
什么 好的 我给他们看个东西 别挂
Huh? Yeah, I'll show them. Hold on.

699
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,200
宝贝 我可不会那么快
Baby, that's not me.

700
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,470
怎么能这样说呢 看看这个
That's mean. Look at this.

701
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,250
一点二秒之后 交配就结束了
...mate for 1.2 seconds and the act is complete.

702
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,880
你为什么要发这个
Why would you send that?

703
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,960
如果真是这样
Anyway, if it was,

704
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,710
那就是你生命中最美妙的三秒钟
it'd be the best three seconds of your life.

705
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,950
我们很想你 注意安全 爱你
We miss you. Be safe. We love you.

706
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,080
我也爱你们

707
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,700
他在做什么
What's he doing?

708
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,530
我想啃啃那肉嘟嘟的胳膊 真可爱
I want to eat those fleshy arms! Come on!

709
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,740
人寿保险办好了吗
What about the life insurance?

710
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,890
这是第二次提醒你了
This is the second notice.

711
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,330
你得去把钱付了
You gotta... You got to pay it.

712
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,190
好的 我会去办的
Okay, okay, I'll figure it out.

713
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,830
我们家前院的那棵橡树怎么样了
And what are we doing about the oak tree in the front lawn?

714
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,390
移除它需要七百美金
The removal's $700...

715
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,830
不对 是一千二 不是七百
No, it's $1,200, not $700.

716
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,340
那家伙简直是在敲诈我
The guy's trying to rip me off.

717
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,090
贝基 听着 我两周后就回来了 好吗
Becky, Becky, listen. I'll be home in two weeks. Okay?

718
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,120
我能自己把它移掉
So I'll take it down myself.

719
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,350
那我们就真的要买人寿保险了
Then we're really gonna need life insurance.

720
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,500
我知道 我在...
I know, I'm...

721
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,830
我在努力 我很快就会回家
I'm trying. I'm coming home soon.

722
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,710
- 欢迎来到麦当劳 - 麦当劳
- Welcome to McDonald's. - McDonald's!

723
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,670
孩子们 别激动 小点声

724
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,470
别激动 妈妈在开车 好吗

725
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,690
我们要二十五份儿童套餐 谢谢

726
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,150
不 我们不要二十五份儿童套餐
No, we don't want 25 Happy Meals.

727
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,690
先生 您能稍等一下吗
Sir, can you just hang on one more second?

728
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,030
我们要饿死了
We're so hungry!

729
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,990
我知道你们饿了 再等一下
I know you are. Just hold on.

730
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,440
可是我们想要玩具
But we want the toys.

731
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,110
随便帮我点六份吃的就行了
Just give me whatever you want. Six of whatever.

732
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,830
我这有六个饿着肚子的小孩
I've got six hungry kids.

733
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,710
- 我们不能这么做 - 装进外卖袋就行了
- We don't do that here. - Throw it all in there.

734
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,400
爸爸 我们要有小宝宝了

736
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,150
贝基 她刚刚说什么了
Becky, what did she just say?

737
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,800
一个宝宝 我们要有小宝宝了
A baby. We're having a baby.

738
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,940
- 另一个宝宝 - 一个宝宝
- Another baby? - A baby.

739
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,520
您需要几份儿童套餐
How many Happy Meals did you want?

740
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,290
给我什么都行 无所谓
You can give me whatever you want! I don't care.

741
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,060
还要麦乐鸡块或芝士汉堡吗
Chicken McNuggets or cheeseburgers?

742
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,330
我们就要有妹妹了
We're having a sister!

743
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,590
不 这样就行了 谢谢
No, that's it, please.

744
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,360
此时在开罗的美国大使馆外
About 1,500 people gathered

745
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,170
已经聚集了约一千五百人...
outside the American Embassy here in Cairo...

746
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,770
家里有什么新消息吗
So, anything new back home?

747
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,940
此处指电影"穆斯林的无知"

748
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,870
...为表达他们对一部非正式
...to voice their discontent and anger

749
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,940
美国电影的不满与愤怒
about an American-made amateur film

750
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,380
他们觉得那是对先知穆罕穆德的侮辱
they say is insulting to the Prophet Muhammad.

751
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,270
没有吗
No?

752
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,900
什么都没有吗
Nothing?

753
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,570
和你聊天很开心
Good talk.

754
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,780
他们表示 虽然那是非正式的
They say that although it's amateur,

755
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,590
但仍侮辱了先知穆罕穆德
it is very much insulting

756
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,120
这已经触碰到了他们的底线
toward the prophet Muhammad and that is their red line.

757
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,010
你好
What up?

758
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,840
听说开罗的事了吗
Heard about Cairo?

759
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,790
"神话的力量" 作者: 约瑟夫·坎贝尔

760

762
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,090
都在你的心中"
are within you."

763
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,950
- 在我心中 - 在你心中
- Within me? - Within you.

764
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,740
我会好好思考一下的
I might have to think about that one.

765
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,490
- 我整晚都会待在这里 - 好的
- Be here all night. - All right.

766
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,380
你知道 我房里真的有把枪 而且我会用它的
You know, I do have a gun in my cubby and I will use it.

767
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,050
一路顺风
Good luck.

768
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,010
她要去和她的联络人共进晚餐
She's having dinner with her contact.

769
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,760
我们会在晚上十点回来
We'll be back at 22:00.

770
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,320
是的
Yeah.

771
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,290
关于此事我仍在等待国务院的回应
Well, I'm still waiting to hear back from State on that.

772
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,210
听着 我只是想为今天的事情道歉
Hey, listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry about today.

773
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,950
我不知道我当时在想什么
I don't know what I was thinking.

774
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,550
可能是在思考接下来的事情
I guess with what we got going on,

775
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,970
我只是希望一切都安好 你知道 我...
I just wanted everything to be right, you know. I...

776
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
我只希望别做错事 但是
I just wanted to do it right, but

777
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,750
我太高兴了 我
I'm so happy. I...

778
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,170
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

779
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,510
我很想你们
I miss you guys very much.

780
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,180
我希望我能在家里
I wish I was home.

781
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,850
我真希望我能在家里
I just wish I was home.

782
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,280
小心敲掉你的牙
It'll knock your teeth out.

783
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,910
这些是上好的番石榴水烟
This is some good guava shisha.

784
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,090
我逮到你了
Yeah, I got you.

785
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,430
是从前门传来的吗
Is that the front gate?

786
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,940
妈的
Holy fuck!

787
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,500
快去拿武器
Go jock up!

788
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,990
- 我去找大使 - 我去管控中心

789
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,000
跟上我 维尼 注意你的身后
Follow me, Vinnie! Watch your six.

790
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,470

791
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,020

我的天 到处都是他们的人
Oh, my God. They're everywhere.

796
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,810
我们该怎么办
What should we do?

797
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,870
M4卡宾枪在哪里
Where's the M4?

805

GRS, all GRS, muster in the CP right now.

808
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,910

I thought it was gonna be a peaceful night.

809

960
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,060
他们闯进去了 隆

961
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:12,850
我们需要空中支援
We need some air support.

962
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,160

963
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,160
一架幽灵攻击机 一架侦察无人机

已经过去二十分钟了
Twenty minutes now.

968
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,360
解救行动已成了自杀行动
It's going from a rescue mission to a suicide mission.

969
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,090
让我们去吧 现在性命攸关
Let us loose. Lives are at stake.

970

你们不是直接行动组
You are not direct-action elements.

971
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,220
主管 你好好想想
Chief, think.

972
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,370
你让他们占领了领事馆
You let them take that consulate,

973
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,680
你觉着他们的下一个目标会是哪
where do you think the next target's gonna be?

974
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,060
基地 我们需要救援
Annex, we need your help.

975

如果你们再不尽快来
If you do not get here soon,

976
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,380
我们就都他妈要死了
we are all gonna fucking die.

977
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,800
阿莫尔 上车 我们走

上车 阿莫尔 我们走
Get in, Amahl. Let's go!

981
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,050
阿莫尔 我没批准你去
Amahl! You're not cleared to go!

982
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,710
见鬼 你们都是擅自行动
God damn it! None of you are!

983
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,290
这工作肯定没得干了
Say goodbye to contract work.

984
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,050
千金难换问心无愧
You can't put a price on being able to live with yourself.

985
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,160
的黎波里 我们需要紧急支援
Tripoli, we need immediate assistance.

986
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:15,680
我们现在他妈的需要帮助
We need fucking help now!

987
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,680
那些混蛋不会明白他们将要面对什么
These assholes have no idea what's coming for them.

988
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,770
见鬼 这他妈是在逗我吧
Shit. You got to be fucking kidding me.

989
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,150
我丢了隐形眼镜
I lost my contact.

990
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,190
见鬼 看不清东西我就没法去
Shit! I can't go if I can't see.

991
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,150
你得想办法解决 伙计
You got to fix this, man.

992
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,130
你得马上想办法解决
You got to fix this right now.

993
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,240
你这家伙 他妈的闭嘴
Hey, funny man, shut the fuck up.

994
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:30,240
你知道我们要去哪
You know where you're going.

995
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,670
- 这不好笑 - 等等
- This ain't funny. - Hold up.

996
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,580
二月十七日旅知道我们要来 对吧
Now 17 Feb knows we're coming, right?

997
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,400
我们怎么知道那是不是二月十七日旅的人
And how do we know that's 17 Feb?

998
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:46,720
隆 你看到了什么
Rone, what are you seeing?

999
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,680
我们距前门三百码 主管
We're 300 yards from the front gate, Chief,

1000
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,220
但有一个路障
but there's a roadblock.

1001
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,720
是友军吗 是二月十七日旅吗
Are they friendlies? Feb 17?

1002
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:57,140
主管 我们正在确认
Chief, trying to assess,

1003
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,940
但这里他妈的没人穿制服
but no one's wearing fucking uniforms here.

1004
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,140
下来 下来
Come on. Come on.

1005
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,150
我晚来可不是为了死在友军枪下的
I didn't get here late just to die in friendly fire.

1006
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,240
用好你的枪
Use your gun.

1007
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,080
问清楚他们指挥官是谁
Find out who the commander is

1008
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,240

阿莫尔 找掩护

I had the rest of the staff cover in their quarters.

1016
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,550

Okay, Bob, Bob, listen to me.

1017

I want 100% accountability. All right?

1018
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,730
我们要加强C栋的安保
We're gonna harden our defenses here in C.

1019
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,060
这将是我们最后的退路

Eight to 10 Tangos, front gate.

1028

视线被建筑物挡住了
We're blocked by buildings.

1089

找不到狙击点

Is there anybody else inside?

1234
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,210
没了
No, no.

1235
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:48,290
- 多亏有你 兄弟 - 没事 伙计
- Glad you're here, brother. - Yeah, buddy.

1236
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:55,480
嘿 他们又回来了
Hey. Hey. They're coming back!

1237
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,460
据说袭击者正在重新集结
They said the attackers are regrouping,

1238
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,750
援军增加了
adding reinforcements.

1239
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:00,840
回来赶尽杀绝吗
Coming back to finish the job?

1240
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,690
杰克 去管控中心帮忙把机密文件拿出来
Jack, help get State's classifieds out of the TOC.

1241
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,840
我带外交安全局的人离开这里
I'm gonna get DS out of here.

1242
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:06,780
你们最好快点
You better hurry up.

1243
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,230
阿莫尔 跟我来 走
Amahl, follow me. Let's go.

1244
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,960
坦托 有麻烦要来了
Tanto, we got a situation coming our way.

1245
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,490
外交安全局的人 上车
DS! Get in your car.

1246
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,000
坦托 是友军
Tanto, blue, blue!

1247
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,700
布恩在里面 进去吧
Boon's inside. Go.

1248
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,580
杰克 那边什么情况
Jack, what's going on over there?

1249
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,910
不怎么乐观
It's not good.

1250
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:32,290
一人死亡 还有人躲在草丛里
We got one KIA. We got guys still in the bushes.

1251
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,000
没找到大使
No Ambo.

1252
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:36,180
袭击者还没走
They're still here.

1253
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,250
我觉得到处都是敌人
I think we got hostiles everywhere.

1254
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,050
火势刚好能做掩护
The fire has just got to be cover.

1255
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,280
他们已经控制了整个院落
They have control of the compound.

1256
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:44,980
为什么要这么快撤退
Why else leave so fast?

1257
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,340
想想《黑鹰坠落》 伙计
Black Hawk Down, man.

1258
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,760
他们会把他的尸体拖到街上游行
They're gonna drag his body through the streets.

1259
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,350
阿莫尔 嘿
Amahl. Hey.

1260
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:54,460
阿莫尔 振作点

1261
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,440
过来 别拿着枪乱指
Come here. Stop pointing your gun!

1262

1265
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,950
该死的 这个混蛋杂种
Oh! Goddamn it! This cockbag motherfucker!

1266
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,000
注意 二月十七日旅的天才指挥官
Be advised the 17 Feb tactical genius commander

1267
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:15,850
他妈的把后门大开着
left the back gate wide fucking open.

1268
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:19,130
好吧 布恩 这面墙做为新的防线
All right, Boon, this wall set as new perimeter.

1269
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,340
用作掩护 拖延敌人
Take cover, hold it.

1270
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:21,600
我们把外交安全局的人带出去
We're getting DS out of here.

1271

全部处理掉 什么都不留
Fire sale! Everything must go.

1275

一大波敌人正朝我们这来
We got a large group of bad guys headed our way.

1276
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,630
我们留在这寻找大使下落
We're gonna stay and look for the Ambo.

1277
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,550
你们先撤退
You guys need to exfil.

1278
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,270
我们少两个人
We're short two guys.

1279
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,510
我这多出来两个特工 但我们得待在一起
I got two more agents, and I'm not leaving them.

1280
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,990

Hey, Tanto, what's going on, man? We got to move.

1281
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,300
蠢货
You dumb piece of shit!

1282
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,220
你们想搞自杀式袭击吗
You blew yourself up trying to frag us, huh?

1283
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:50,860

出大门以后左拐
When you go outside that gate, you go left,

1291
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:46,590

To the right is bad guys. You are going left.

1298
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,810
从基地的后面进去
You're taking the back way to the annex.

1299
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,830
- 懂了吗 - 懂了
- You got it? - I got it.

1300
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:03,280
听着 我觉得换个人开车好点
Listen, I think somebody else should drive.

1301

01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,570
别开枪
No, don't shoot!

1304
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,040
走走走
Move, move, move, move.

1305

敌人正从后门涌进来
They're flooding in through the back gate!

1307
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,330
快跑 快跑

State. We are exfilling the compound,

1312
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,100
没找到大使

1313
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:37,730

不知道 可能是十七日旅的
I don't know. Maybe he's 17 Feb.

1323
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:57,880
也许是友军
Maybe he's friendly.

1324
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:58,770
也许他是在说
Maybe he's saying go the other way.

1325
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:59,880
走另一边
Go the other way.

真不敢相信我们没找到大使就走了
I can't believe we left without him.

1329
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:11,110
你走错路了
You're going the wrong way.

1330
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,090
杰克 到屋顶上来

敌人在左边
Tangos left.

1334
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:39,650
这帮人不可能在这待一整晚
Hey. No way these guys are in for the night.

1335
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,080
他们初尝胜利的果实
They got a little taste of victory.

1336
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:42,570
下个目标就是基地
The annex is next.

1337

坦托 布恩 集合 我们离开这里

撤退
Exfil!

1340
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,380
把门打开
Get that door open!

1341
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,480
刚才真是激烈
That was intense.

1342
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,690
我忘了榴弹发射器了
I forgot the grenade launcher.

1343
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,160
有一辆车在移动
We got a mover.

1344
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,810
外安局的装甲车正在离开使馆区
State armored car leaving compound.

1345
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,920
捕捉到目标车辆 顺发射中心22度角
Target vehicle intercept. Downrange 22 degrees.

1346
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,500
一切就绪 等待命令
Stand by for words.

1347
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,810
我们在绕圈 斯科特
We just went in a circle, Scott.

1348
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,790

What is this shit?

1349
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:29,630
这人是谁
Who is this?

1350
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:33,550
他在说什么
What is he saying?

1351
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:35,350
不太妙 快走吧
This is a bad idea. Just go.

1352
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,260
目标车辆停下来了
Target vehicle has stopped.

1353
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,220
敌人从四面八方汇聚过来
Tangos converging from all sides.

1354
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,390
这人是谁 这是谁
Who the fuck is this guy? Who is this guy?

1355
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,100
你是什么人
Who are you?

1356
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:47,460
他这个动作
He's doing this.

1357
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:49,370
可能想说他不是敌人
I think he's trying to say he's friendly.

1358
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,910
不 我们不认识这些人 这很危险
No, we don't know these guys. This is not safe.

1359
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,410
我们不认识他们 待在这很危险
We don't know them. We're not safe here.

1360
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:55,330
阳台上有两个人 阳台上有两个人
Two guys on the balcony. Two guys on the balcony.

1361
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,580
我们得离开这里
We need to get out of here.

1362
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,000
那是谁
Who is that?

1363
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,400
这是陷阱 戴夫 肯定有埋伏
It's a trap, Dave, it's an ambush!

1364
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,460
我们得赶快走
We've got to move!

1365
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,460
也可能他想阻止我们中埋伏
He might be trying to keep us from an ambush.

1366
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,880
你是什么人
Who are you?

1367
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:06,920
快后退 快后退
Back up while we can. Back up while we can.

1368
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:08,070
你们是谁
Who are you?

1369
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,090
走开 别挡路
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1370
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:23,680
快走 快走 冲过去

就等着承受我们的怒火吧

01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,200
是不是他们在讲话
Are they talking?

1508
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,400
阿莫尔
Amahl!

1509
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,890
阿莫尔 你看到了什么 你受伤了吗
Amahl, what did you see? Are you hurt?

1510
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,120
阿莫尔 外面出了什么事
Amahl, what's happening out there?

1511
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:41,920
- 太糟了 非常不好 - 阿莫尔
- It's so bad. It's not good. - Amahl!

1512
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:43,820
阿莫尔 我能拿回我的枪么
Amahl, can I get my gun?

1513
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,870
对不起 伙计 我可能会用到它
Sorry, buddy, I think I'm gonna need it.

1514
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:47,500
见鬼
Shit.

1515
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:49,620
外面情况怎么样
What's the situation out there?

1516
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:51,200
拿支枪 去楼顶找我
Grab a gun, meet me on the roof.

1517
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:52,690
我就告诉你
I'll tell you all about it.

1518
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:55,010
他开玩笑的 是吧
He isn't serious, is he?

1519
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,890
那是他干的活 不是我的
'Cause that's his job, that's not my job.

1520
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,370
他是认真的
He is serious.

1521
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,290
快上来 自己去看看
Come on up! Check it out!

1522
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,360
听好了 伙计们
Listen up, guys!

1523
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,580
我去C栋
I'm gonna take Building C.

1524
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:21,450
杰克 泰格 你们去D栋
Jack, Tig, I want you on Building D.

1525
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:23,460
坦托和布恩去A栋
Building A, Tanto, Boon.

1526
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:25,570
外交安全局的人 B楼归你们
Building B, DS guys, that's your territory.

1527
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:27,840
奥兹去一号塔 负责僵尸之地
Oz, Tower 1. Zombieland.

1528
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,370
开始行动 各就各位
Let's go. Hit it.

1529
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:31,540
快点
Move!

1530
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:33,250
快快快 都加快速度
Let's go! Let's go! Let's hustle up!

1531
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,830
隆 我到塔楼了 准备上C栋
Rone, I got the tower! Getting up on C!

1532
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:12,960
他们只是本地的牧羊人
They're just the local shepherds.

1533
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,080
嘿 怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

1534
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,520
门口有个邻居过来
We got a neighbor at the gate

1535
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:13,830
投诉我们的灯太亮了
complaining about our lights.

1536
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,570
什么 他是不是以为我们要开泳池派对
What, does he think we're having a pool party?

1537
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,880
他说不要开灯 不然他们会找到你们
He says the lights are bad. They're going to find you.

1538
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,000
"他们"
"They"?

1539
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,950
他怎么知道"他们"是谁 问他
How the fuck does he know who "They" Are? Ask him.

1540
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,080
他已经走了
He's already gone.

1541
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:28,020
兄弟们 我们要想想办法
Guys, we really need to do something

1542
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,820
搞定这些灯
about these lights.

1543
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:32,000
我们得把灯全都关掉
We've got to shut all these lights down.

1544
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,210
兄弟们 让你们的红外线不停发信号给攻击机
Hey, guys, keep your IRS pointed up for the gunship

1545
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,850
希望攻击机他妈地能来
that's hopefully fucking coming.

1546
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,210
不用秘密行动了
Time for stealth has passed.

1547
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,090
韦佩尔 把外缘的探照灯开着
Viper, keep the perimeter floodlights on.

1548
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,760
关了里面的灯
Shut off the interiors.

1549
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,350
收到 收到 快点 快翻到
Roger that. Roger that. Come on, come on.

1550
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:48,650
在伊拉克时
In Iraq,

1551
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,480
有黑鹰直升机救我们
we had Black Hawks to get us out of shit like this.

1552
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,560
在这里我们什么都没有 也没有支援
Yeah. Well, here we got nothing and no one.

1553
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:56,270
把里面的灯关掉
Kill the interior lights!

1554
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:57,580
亮着灯我们就是活靶子
We're lit fucking targets up here.

1555
01:25:57,610 --> 01:25:58,450
我在关了 伙计
I'm trying, man.

1556
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:02,680
你好啊
Hello.

1557
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,380
真诡异
Surreal.

1558
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:08,070
不在同一个世界
Different world.

1559
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
这是谁
Who's this?

1560
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,430
阿莫尔 那些车是
Amahl, are those cars

1561
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:20,880
从邻居家里出来的吗
coming from the neighbor's house?

1562
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:25,310
嘿 他们他妈的要去哪
Hey! Where the fuck are they going?

1563
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,950
伙计们 我们刚刚失去所有的利比亚安全部队
Guys, we just lost all our Libyan security.

1564
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,500
好像除了我们
Does it seem like everybody knows

1565
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,280
每个人都知道是怎么回事
what's going on around here but us?

1566
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,520
确实如此
That's for sure.

1567
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,070
频闪信号灯开了 告诉无人机我们的位置
Strobe's on, marking our position for the Predator.

1568
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,510
我不想打击你
I hate to break it to you,

1569
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:44,330
但我认为不会有攻击机支援了
but I don't think we're getting any gunships.

1570
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:48,270
鬼才会来 空中支援 那就简单多了
Oh. Hell no. Air support? That'd be too easy.

1571
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,850
韦佩尔 把里面的灯都他妈给我关掉
Viper, turn off these goddamn interiors

1572
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,220
不然我就自己打掉它们
or I'm gonna shoot them out myself!

1573
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,120
我在关了
I'm working on it.

1574
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:55,930
- 他今晚没睡好 - 给力啊
- He's having a bad night. - Work with me.

1575
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,320
- 妈的 - 拜托
- Fuck. - Come on.

1576
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:02,130
对不起 伙计们 我只是有点紧张
Sorry, guys. I'm just a bit nervous.

1577
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,530
终于关了 谢谢
Wow. Thank you.

1578
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,360
隆 你觉得他们会从哪条路进攻
Rone, which way you think they're coming?

1579
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:10,810
他们来的话 肯定是从僵尸之地过来
When they come, they're coming through Zombieland.

1580
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:17,530
很奇怪
That's strange.

1581
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,150
那辆警车减速了 然后速度又加回去了
That cop slowed down, then sped back up.

1582
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,940
我觉得我他妈置身在恐怖片中
I feel like I'm in a fucking horror movie.

1583
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,910
- 大厨 - 怎么了
- Chef? - Yeah?

1584
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,410
就放在那里行了
Put that down right there.

1585
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,870
你去楼下 确保楼里每个人都安全
You go downstairs, make sure everybody in this building's safe.

1586
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:32,770
这就去
Got it.

1587
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,100
奥兹 这就是我们表明立场的地方
Oz? This is where we make our stand!

1588
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:41,640
- 外面很黑 - 嘿 隆
- It's dark out there. - Hey, Rone,

1589
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,340
我们准备去B栋 那边位置更有利
We're going to Building B. It's better vantage.

1590
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,080
叫外交安全局的人离开那里
Get those DS guys off of there.

1591
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,140
外安局的
State!

1592
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:48,850
你们下楼
I want you to go down

1593
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:50,790
在地面保护C栋
and protect Building C from the ground.

1594
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:05,900
伙计们 我们要让射击区域
Guys, let's set sectors of fire with

1595
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:07,340
相互重叠
overlapping coverage.

1596
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,050
泰格 我在三号塔上和你范围相同
Tig, I can use you over here on Tower 3.

1597
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,710
奥兹 有什么发现吗
Oz, what do you got?

1598
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,700
只有几个本地牧羊人在散步
I got a couple of local shepherds walking.

1599
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:20,380
嘿 我们负责这里 外面空地面积太大
Hey, State, we got this. Lot of acreage out there.

1600
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:22,120
- 戴上你们的夜视镜 - 收到
- Get on your NODs. - Copy that.

1601
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:26,210
主管 我们在等任何友军
Hey, Chief. Are we expecting

1602
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,920
来设置外围防线吗
any friendlies to set up a perimeter?

1603
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,930
我印象里没有 怎么了
Not that I know of. Why?

1604
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,470
因为我们的东侧聚集了很多车
'Cause we got cars amassing, east side.

1605
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,990
就在那栋房子外面的停车场
In the parking lot out by that house

1606
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:36,530
还有几个青少年在院子里放炮仗
where the teenagers are that throw the M-80s over the yard.

1607
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,660
所以我猜他们要打牌玩通宵了
Then I guess it could be poker night.

1608
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:40,210
你等等
Just hold on.

1609
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:43,110
我看到有两辆警车开了进去
Hey. I got two cop cars pulling in.

1610
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,530
主管 我们近期在等
Chief, are we expecting

1611
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,710
班加西的警方来支援吗
any of Benghazi's finest anytime soon?

1612
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,900
我核实一下 等等
Let me check on it. Hold on.

1613
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,350
你慢慢来
Yeah. Take your time.

1614
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,230
艾伦 看下外围的情况
Alan, check the perimeter.

1615
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,920
打电话问班加西警方是否有派人来
Call Benghazi police and see if that's them.

1616
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,860
主管 这些警察
Chief, these cops?

1617
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,860
我赌他们和坏人是一伙的
I bet you they work for the bad guys.

1618
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,500
你觉得这像二月十七日旅的人吗
Does this look like 17 Feb to you?

1619
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,030
老兄 你他妈怎么知道
Dude, how can you fucking tell?

1620
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:04,640
在证明他们不是敌人之前 他们都是敌人
They're all bad guys until they're not.

1621
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:10,700
警车走了
And there go the cop cars.

1622
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:13,270
我这边有动静 你们看到了吗
I got movement. You see this, guys?

1623
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,600
我看到了
Yeah, I see it.

1624
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:15,680
布恩 你看到多少个人
Boon, how many you see?

1625
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,910
人数不清 他们正在向停车场移动
I got unknowns moving to the parking lot.

1626
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:18,960
十五个目标
Fifteen Tangos.

1627
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:20,000
我等下给你回电话
I gotta call you back.

1628
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,550
这个制高点真的不错
Good vantage point from here.

1629
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:24,250
奥兹
Oz?

1630
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,500
我这边有超过五个人
All right. I got five more guys

1631
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:28,360
就跟在小牧羊人的后面
right behind them little shepherds.

1632
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,310
有一个人斜背着什么东西
One of them's got something slung.

1633
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:31,660
我看不清是什么
I can't see what it is.

1634
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,300
班加西的人都有武器
Everyone's got weapons in Benghazi.

1635
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,220
除非你看到某人手上有武器
Until you see a weapon in someone's hands,

1636
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,320
否则不要开枪
you do not fire.

1637
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:37,730
我不想有人因此蹲大牢
I don't want anybody going to prison.

1638
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:39,430
收到
Roger that.

1639
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:43,760
现在他们分散了 游戏时间到
Okay, they're breaking off. It's game time.

1640
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,260
兄弟们 他们来了
Guys, they are coming in.

1641
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:49,510
没错 他们现在过来了
Oh, yeah, they're coming in now. Come on.

1642
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:01,980
主管 如果我们在等任何友军的话
Chief, if we're expecting any friendlies,

1643
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,050
我现在就要知道
I need to know that information now.

1644
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,760
我不知道有什么友军
I am not aware of any friendlies.

1645
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:07,980
我未收到确认
I have no confirmation.

1646
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:15,880
非洲司令部 根据部署的频闪追踪器
AFRICOM, ISR is approaching target coordinates

1647
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,530
无人侦察机正在接近目标地点
from deployed strobe tracker.

1648
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:19,480
等候下一步指令
Await further instruction.

1649
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:21,890
无人机 报告侦察情况
ISR, eyes-on report.

1650
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,440
非洲司令部 若干身份不明的人
AFRICOM, unknowns are advancing

1651
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:26,190
正穿过南方和东南方的空地
toward subject compound

1652
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,960
向目标院落前进
moving from south/southeast over open ground.

1653
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:31,590
没有标志或军旗 行动分散
No tags or colors. Asymmetrical movements.

1654
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:33,250
没有观测到武器
No weapons observed.

1655
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,840
摄像机放大倍数达到一百四十
Cyclops pushing in at 140.

1656
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,010
我们现在已经被敌人包围了
State, we're being surrounded by Tangos right now.

1657
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,180
主管 恶梦要开始变成现实了
Chief, this shit's starting to get real.

1658
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:45,730
奥兹 柱子附近有七个敌人
Oz, we got seven Tangos by the pillars.

1659
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:48,530
看到了
Got 'em.

1660
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,030
让他们过来
Let 'em come.

1661
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,660
让他们过来
Let 'em come.

1662
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,790
让他们来
Let 'em come.

1663
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,330
主管 能批准射击了吗
Chief, are we cleared hot to shoot?

1664
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:20,720
主管 我再问一遍 能批准射击了吗
Chief, I repeat, are we cleared hot to shoot?

1665
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:25,230
看到武器后 狙击手自行判断射击
See a weapon, shooter's discretion.

1666
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:26,260
都不要开枪
Everybody hold.

1667
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,750
没有我的命令都他妈不准开枪
You do not fucking fire till I give the word.

1668
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,400
布恩 我不会射小孩子的
I ain't shooting no kids, Boon.

1669
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:32,570
好了 伙计们 睁大双眼
All right, guys, eyes open.

1670
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:34,150
我会用红外线标记他们
I'm gonna paint these guys with the infrared

1671
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:35,520
保证我们的行动同步
so we're all on the same page.

1672
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,400
大家都看到这个人了吗
Everybody got this guy?

1673
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,440
- 收到 - 我看到了
- Roger. - Yeah. I got him.

1674
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:40,740
这一个
This guy?

1675
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,330
- 看到了 - 看到了
- Got him. - Got him.

1676
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:43,680
这一个
This guy?

1677
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:45,130
- 看到了 - 看到了
- Got him. - Got him.

1678
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:47,200
- 还有那一个 - 三个人

1679
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:48,170
我看到他了
I see him.

1680
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:49,530
瞧瞧这些家伙
Look at these guys.

1681
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,390
好像小孩子在玩捉迷藏
It's like kids playing hide and seek.

1682
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,750
我看到有AK步枪
I got AKs.

1683
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,730
得把他们引过来
You guys got to draw them in.

1684
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,510
引过来 他们看不见你
Draw them in. They cannot see you.

1685
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:59,430
我们有夜视 他们没有
We have night vision, they don't.

1686
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:00,570
现在把灯关了
Turn the lights off now.

1687
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,210
要让他们靠多近
How much closer do we let them get?

1688
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,450
他们有武器
They got weapons.

1689
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,480
快下令 隆 他们就在跟前了
Come on, Rone, they're right here.

1690
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:08,930
我看到大概有25到30个敌人
We got about 25-30 Tangos.

1691
01:32:56,150 --> 01:32:57,640
我负责右翼
I'm taking the right side.

1692
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,780
泰格 你中弹了吗
Tig, you hit?

1693
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,640
你还好吗
You all right?

1694
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:42,670
打在防弹衣上了
Armor caught it.

1695
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:55,880
那是个错误
That's a mistake.

1696
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,340
兄弟们 我们打退他们了
Dude, we kicked their asses!

1697
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:08,720
不知道我应该感到幸运还是不幸
I don't know if I'm feeling lucky or unlucky.

1698
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,320
他们以为是走进
They thought they were walking into

1699
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,520
另一个临时大使馆
another temporary embassy.

1700
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:13,840
找错地方了 老兄
Not here, brother.

1701
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:16,270
主管 给我们弄点空中支援
Chief, get us some air support,

1702
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,570
他妈的什么支援都行
Get us fucking something!

1703
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,730
全球响应人员 报到
GRS, check in.

1704
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,370
B栋布恩 坦托 没事
All good, Boon, Tanto, Building B.

1705
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,860
D栋 停火了
D was out of the fight.

1706
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:26,700
三号塔 泰格和奥兹 好的不能再好了
Tower 3, Tig and Oz, never better.

1707
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:28,740
我扶你起来 别站
Let's get you up. Stay down.

1708
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:34,630
敌方的房子里还有动静 泰
Bad guy's house is still active, Ty.

1709
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:36,630
我们盯着了
We got eyes on.

1710
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,190
收到
Roger that.

1711
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,760
他们把灯都打烂了
They shot out all the lights.

1712
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,610
第一波人完成任务了
First wave got the job done.

1713
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:46,090
- 你想喝咖啡吗 - 太他妈想了
- You want a coffee? - I sure as hell do.

1714
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,350
我猜无人机看到三十个人在打我们了
I guess the drone saw 30 guys shooting at us.

1715
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:50,420
快点来啊
Come on.

1716
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,070
二号技术加密安全
Secure with tech two encryption.

1717
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,500
为什么这个牧羊人枪战之后还在闲逛
Why is this shepherd walking around after a gunfight?

1718
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:03,160
太反常了
So bizarre.

1719
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:04,680
我快要被这些羊吓疯了
These sheep freak me out.

1720
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:07,260
可能会有人在羊群里乱开枪的
Somebody could take a potshot from in there.

1721
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,250
我觉得不太安全
I don't think it's safe.

1722
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:10,570
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

1723
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,280
戴夫 你得放松点
Dave, you got to slow it down, buddy.

1724
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,460
你太拼命了
You're working too hard.

1725
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:23,390
我别无选择
Look, this isn't a choice for me.

1726
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:26,200
我们没保护好大使
We lost the Ambassador.

1727
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,510
这笔账可是算在我们头上 不是你们
That's on our heads, not yours.

1728
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,810
我懂的 我知道你在想什么
And, look, I get it. I know what you're thinking.

1729
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,030
但如果斯科特在安全屋里向暴徒开枪的话
But if Scott had fired on that mob from the safe haven,

1730
01:35:35,050 --> 01:35:36,420
他的位置就会暴露
it would've given away his position.

1731
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,940
那样我们不会有一丝机会
And we wouldn't have had a fighting chance in hell

1732
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:39,110
把他救出来
to get him out.

1733
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,150
所以这场战斗 我要全程参与
So, I'm in this fight. All night.

1734
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:49,110
我知道你会的
I know you are.

1735
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,660
我懂的 兄弟
I get it, man.

1736
01:35:55,850 --> 01:36:00,220
{\an4}凌晨 1:28 班加西国际机场
12 英里外

1737
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:07,720
嘿 怎么回事 我们的车呢
Hey! Hey, what's going on? Where are our rides?

1738
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,130
这些利比亚官僚只会
Look, this is all screwed-up

1739
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,230
搞砸事情
Libyan bureaucracy. Okay.

1740
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:11,240
谁来开车 谁先走
Who drives, who goes first,

1741
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:12,370
肯定谁拿的钱最多
and of course who gets paid the most.

1742
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,500
我们没时间讨论这个
We don't have time for this!

1743
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,110
你和他们说自己搞定
You tell them to figure it out.

1744
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,360
把他们看紧了
Keep a close watch on them.

1745
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:19,900
我们不知道这些人是敌是友
We don't know who's good and who's bad.

1746
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:21,010
收到
Copy that.

1747
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,280
我们着陆了 但是遇到了麻烦
We're wheels down, but we got a problem.

1748
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:31,790
有什么发现吗 咖啡给我
What do you got? Coffee.

1749
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,450
- 阿莫尔 - 怎么了
- Amahl. - Yes.

1750
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,890
告诉他让他
Tell him he should assemble his men

1751
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:36,900
尽快集结自己的部队
as quickly as possible

1752
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:38,060
我们会付他钱
and that we will pay him.

1753
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:42,960
- 他要求现金 - 现金 可以
- Cash. - Cash? Fine.

1754
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:44,180
多长时间 他们多久能到这
When? When can they be here?

1755
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:45,110
主管在哪
Where's the Chief?

1756
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,180
让他尽快把
Just bring...That he brings his

1757
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,490
他的部队带过来
fucking men as soon as possible

1758
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,930
然后把我们救出去
and get us the hell out of here.

1759
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,500
外面现在一团糟
Looting the compound.

1760
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,490
鲜血滴入水中 会引来饥饿的鲨鱼
Blood in the water. Sharks are circling.

1761
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:01,340
的黎波里的队伍被困在机场了
The Tripoli team is stuck at the airport.

1762
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:05,000
他们需要护送的人 他们并不熟悉这座城市
They need an escort. They don't know the city.

1763
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:11,450
利比亚政府不表达下爱意吗
No love from the Libyan government?

1764
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,780
他们的人要么下班回家了
They've gone home for the night.

1765
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,830
要么就是不接我们的电话
Or just not answering.

1766
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,260
那我们的自己人呢
What about ours?

1767
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:20,930
他们接电话了吗
They picking up the phone?

1768
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:23,470
我正在让人联系
I'm working on it.

1769
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:24,830
无人机在天上盘旋
That drone feed's up.

1770
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,060
它看到的情况比我们还多
They're seeing everything we see and more.

1771
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:34,320
五角大楼 - 任务指挥中心

1772
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:40,490
克罗地亚 -  美军第十特种部队 准备重新部署

1773
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:39,580
主管 将军已经确认可以调来班加西的部队了
Chief, general have identified the forces that can move to Benghazi.

1774
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,220
我们说话这会他们正在集结
They're spinning up as we speak.

1775
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,690
国务院一直在请求
State has been asked

1776
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,190
东道国的入境许可
to secure the approval from the host nation.

1777
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:46,250
将军 这很有可能是敌方机场
General, this could be a hostile airport,

1778
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,570
所以我们要考虑每一种选择
so we are considering every option.

1779
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:50,820
我明白 现在局势不明
Understood. It's a fluid situation.

1780
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,680
但是那有许多美国公民被困
But there are a lot of Americans stuck there.

1781
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:54,230
我说先把士兵空运过去
I say we get them airborne,

1782
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:55,460
然后再做决定
then we can make our decision.

1783
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:58,020
格伦 我们已经在这里浪费三个小时了
Hey, Glen, we've been waiting for three hours.

1784
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,030
我们能不能直接征用这些车辆然后出发
Can we just commandeer these vehicles and go?

1785
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:03,030
进去不是问题 怎么出来才是问题
Getting in isn't the problem. Getting out again is.

1786
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:08,470
你能否告诉他们
Can you explain to them

1787
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:09,680
如果在这浪费时间
that if this bullshit ends up

1788
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:10,640
导致美国人死亡的话
costing American lives,

1789
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:11,600
我会回来
I'm gonna come back here

1790
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:13,150
亲手宰了他们
and cut all their throats myself,

1791
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,540
先告诉这家伙
starting with him.

1792
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:15,850
告诉他
You tell him that.

1793
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,170
真他妈的荒诞
What a shitshow.

1794
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,500
国务院收到一份班加西医疗中心的报告
State got a report from the Benghazi Medical Center

1795
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:23,820
报告说一群利比亚人
that said a crowd of Libyans

1796
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:25,840
送了一个美国男性入院
brought in an American male

1797
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:27,290
活着的
alive.

1798
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:29,600
他们用的是斯科特·威克兰德的电话
They used Scott Wickland's phone,

1799
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:30,900
据说是从克利斯的口袋里找到的
said it came from Chris' pocket.

1800
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,440
他们可能是想把我们引出去
Could try and draw us in.

1801
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:38,190
小心埋伏
Watch out for an ambush.

1802
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:41,640
你看见了什么
What do you see?

1803
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,810
我不太清楚看到的是什么
I'm not sure what it is.

1804
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:47,900
要么有坏人在羊群下面匍匐前进
Either the bad guys are crawling under the sheep

1805
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,930
要么就是羊群在发情
or the sheep are humping.

1806
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:54,250
晚上两点半的时候发情
2:30 at night?

1807
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:58,390
我对羊的习性一无所知
I don't know anything about sheep.

1808
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,800
小心点
Watch your step.

1809
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:14,770
奥兹
Oz.

1810
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:17,060
蹲低一点 蹲低一点
Stay low. Stay low.

1811
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:21,910
我给你带了糖和一些喝的
I brought you candy bars and some drinks.

1812
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,280
你头受伤了
Your head.

1813
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:31,310
没事
It's nothing.

1814
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,680
你还需要什么别的东西吗
You need anything else?

1815
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:34,980
好吧
Well,

1816
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:38,430
要是有一把躺椅就太棒了
a lawn chair wouldn't be bad.

1817
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:40,110
好的 没问题
Right. No problem.

1818
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:49,400
战斗机是空对空攻击 攻击机是空对地攻击

1819
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:41,670
再来架攻击机
And a gunship.

1820
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:46,780
我觉得那个可能弄不到
I don't think we're gonna be able to get you that.

1821
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:49,400
有几架F16战斗机也勉强可以
I'd settle for a few F16s.

1822
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:52,280
战斗机在城市上空低空飞行
Low fly-by over the city would

1823
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,970
就能让他们感受到对上帝和美国的畏惧
put the fear of God and the United States in them.

1824
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:58,910
为我们争取几个小时时间
Buy us a few more hours.

1825
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:08,140
你们还能坚持多久
How long can you hold them off?

1826
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:13,100
有多少敌人 多强火力
Any large force with any real ordnance,

1827
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:13,870
我一无所知
I don't know.

1828
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:19,010
你在这和家里有熟人吗
You got contacts here and at home?

1829
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,250
去联系一下吧
Start making some calls.

1830
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,040
嘿 脱衣舞娘来了
Hey, the stripper's here!

1831
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:27,830
- 这是你的衣服 - 来的真及时
- Here are your clothes. - About time.

1832
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:30,530
楼下情况怎么样了
How are the Jason Bournes doing downstairs?

1833
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,850
每个人都很害怕
Everyone's scared.

1834
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,110
我刚收到我表哥的
I just got a text from my cousin,

1835
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:35,010
警告信息
you know, a warning,

1836
01:40:35,570 --> 01:40:37,320
让我们趁早离开这里
saying to leave before it's too late.

1837
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:39,120
还有好消息吗
More good news.

1838
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:40,470
有更具体的建议吗
Anything more specific than that?

1839
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:44,900
我觉得我们不再需要翻译了 阿莫尔
I don't think we need an interpreter anymore, Amahl.

1840
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,930
你干得不错 你应该离开
You did good. You should go.

1841
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:52,830
不 我要留下和你们在一起
No. I'm staying here with you guys.

1842
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,340
我会在楼下呆着
I'll be downstairs.

1843
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,090
我得在离开利比亚之前
I'm gonna have to break up

1844
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:04,350
和他分手
with him before we leave Libya.

1845
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:08,150
你们在这开派对
How do you leave me on D

1846
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:09,500
居然把我丢在D楼
when the party's right here?

1847
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:13,430
关于大使还活着这事
Hey, about this whole Ambo story,

1848
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:15,330
我不相信
I don't buy it.

1849
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:17,190
如果他还活着
And if he is still alive,

1850
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:19,160
格伦的队伍得先去救他
Glen's team's gonna get him out first.

1851
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:21,660
如果他们去了 那就没人来救我们了
If they do, they're not gonna get to us.

1852
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:23,980
所以我们得准备在这里再坚持一段时间了
So we've got to be prepared to be here for a while.

1853
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:27,140
主管说国内的新闻已经在报道了
Chief said it was on the news back home.

1854
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:30,630
街头示威抗议什么的 反伊斯兰的电影
Something about street protests. Anti-Islamic films.

1855
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:32,780
我们没有听到任何示威抗议
We didn't hear any protests.

1856
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:34,560
是在电视新闻上报道的 哥们
It was reported in the news, buddy.

1857
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,430
你看见了吗
You see that?

1858
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,820
在走私者小路的尽头 你看看
At the end of Smuggler's Alley. Take a look.

1859
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:54,690
可能是要开辟第二战场
Could be a second front forming.

1860
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,770
或者是一些无知的围观群众
Or an audience gathering to watch the show.

1861
01:41:57,110 --> 01:41:58,030
主管
Hey, Chief.

1862
01:41:58,190 --> 01:41:59,950
我知道你今天晚上妙语如珠
I know you've had some pearls of wisdom tonight,

1863
01:41:59,970 --> 01:42:01,570
但是我们是否在等友军支援
but are we expecting any friendlies?

1864
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,410
我看到许多人在活动
I got a lot of movement out here.

1865
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,180
看样子我们又要遭到攻击了
Looks like we're gonna get hit again.

1866
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:12,360
戴夫 你负责僵尸之地 奥兹 跟我走
Dave, take Zombieland. Oz, with me.

1867
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:16,470
加强防护 加强防护
Grab a shield. Grab a shield.

1868
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,690
主管 让他们把无人机上的
Chief, tell them to get the Hellfire on

1869
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:29,580
导弹准备好
that Pred ready.

1870
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,100
警告
Be advised,

1871
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,320
无人机发现大量车辆和人员聚集在停车场
ISR saying that cars and bodies are massing

1872
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,980
正向我们的西面靠近
in the parking lot to our west.

1873
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,350
没错 主管 两分钟前
Yeah, Chief, I just put

1874
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:51,380
我才在无线电里报告过
that out over the radio about two minutes ago.

1875
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:54,160
告诉无人机驾驶 他们真是没用
Tell the ISR guys they're pretty much worthless.

1876
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:56,290
自作聪明的家伙
Fucking smartass.

1877
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,070
快点 快点 快点
Come on, come on, come on!

1878
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:07,450
发送
Send.

1879
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:22,460
主管 有三十个人正在靠近
Chief, we got 30 guys approaching.

1880
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:27,290
那玩意开火时声音大吗
Hey. Is that thing loud?

1881
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:29,780
挺大的
Oh, yeah.

1882
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:32,040
我忘带耳塞了
I forgot my earplugs.

1883
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:34,540
注意你们负责的区域
Keep your eyes on your assigned quadrants.

1884
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:35,960
最好不要遭到侧面突袭
We don't want to get flanked.

1885
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,000
准备好了吗 泰格
You ready, Tig?

1886
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:41,930
- 准备好了 - 小心对方的诡计
- Here we go. - Watch for different tactics.

1887
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,140
奥兹
Oz?

1888
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:52,100
怎么不用卫生棉条塞耳
You lose your tampon?

1889
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,510
泰格 小心松树那个方向
Tig, watch the pine trees.

1890
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,320
那是什么东西
What is this?

1891
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:25,300
这辆车想干嘛
What is this yo-yo doing?

1892
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:27,220
你觉得他们不知道我们有夜视境吗
You think they don't know we have night vision?

1893
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:31,900
全球响应人员 所有人不要开火
GRS, I want everybody to hold.

1894
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:35,940
距离三十码
Thirty yards.

1895
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:42,400
不不 你要干什么
No, no, no, no. What are you doing?

1896
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:43,840
不 别这样做 操
No, don't do that. Fuck!

1897
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:53,700
趴下
Get down!

1898
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:00,580
什么 说大声点
What? Louder!

1899
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:04,560
停火 停止开火
Stop! Stop shooting!

1900
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:06,210
二月十七日旅说你们正在向他们射击
17 Feb says you're firing at them!

1901
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,840
是他们先开枪的
Somebody started shooting at us first!

1902
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,680
而且他们现在还在射击
And they're still fucking shooting at us!

1903
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:15,430
告诉他们先停火
Tell them to stop shooting at us

1904
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,100
然后我们就会停火
and we'll stop shooting at them.

1905
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:20,190
要是他们还在射击 你们就打回去
If they're shooting at you, just fucking shoot back!

1906
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:21,770
我就是这个意思
That's what I'm telling you!

1907
01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:23,750
有三十多个人在对着我们开火
We got 30 guys firing at us!

1908
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,730
二月十七日旅 才怪
17 Feb, my ass.

1909
01:45:31,110 --> 01:45:32,240
泰格 注意林木线
Tig, tree line.

1910
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:01,460
他们从侧面的僵尸之地攻过来了
They're flanking us from Zombieland!

1911
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:02,820
- 转移位置 - 正在转移
- Move! - Moving!

1912
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:10,780
楼下那个窗户
Upstairs window.

1913
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:28,860
公共汽车那边
Bus.

1914
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:31,050
看到一个大炸弹正从那出来
We got big ordnance coming out of there.

1915
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:32,070
攻击公共汽车
Hit the bus!

1916
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:47,110
这一炮是要打我们的
That one's for us.

1917
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:55,050
这次你们别想逃
You're not getting away this time!

1918
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:05,210
你觉得他们泄气了吗
You think they're losing heart?

1919
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,660
所有人 来这边
Everyone, over here.

1920
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:10,960
给我找出所有能到达我们这的空军基地
Find me every airbase in the area that can reach us.

1921
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:12,220
找到任何快速反应部队
Find me any quick response teams,

1922
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,290
任何附近的海军航母战斗群
any Navy carrier battle groups in the vicinity, now.

1923
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,520
我听说在克罗地亚有一支战区指挥官应急连
I hear they have a US CIF team in Croatia.

1924
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:25,740
距此有两个小时的飞行时间
That's a two-hour flight.

1925
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:29,190
位于意大利东北部的阿维亚诺市

1926
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:29,330
西格奈拉基地 阿维亚诺空军基地 班加西
Sigonella, Aviano, Benghazi.

1927
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,060
- 阿维亚诺离这多远 - 七百英里
- How far is Aviano? - 700 miles.

1928
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:33,770
有一架F16战斗机全天候待命
There's an F16, 365 days 24/7.

1929
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:34,650
那里是一个快速反应基地
It's a quick response base.

1930
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:35,840
行 让飞机从西格奈拉基地起飞
Well, bring it in from Sigonella.

1931
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:37,630
从意大利过来就他妈两步路而已
It's a fucking puddle jump from Italy to here.

1932
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:38,700
是二十分钟航程
It's 20 minutes.

1933
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,480
我不是请求火力支援
I'm not requesting firepower.

1934
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,430
我只希望你们能
All I want is that you give these

1935
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:46,100
来个低空飞行
assholes outside our gate

1936
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:49,670
告诉我们门外的混蛋"滚蛋"
a low, loud "Fuck you" Flyover.

1937
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:52,550
我的权限
My authority?

1938
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:57,390
我的权限
My authority

1939
01:47:57,710 --> 01:47:59,120
就是你们如果不派人来
is that if you don't send,

1940
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,800
美国公民就会死
Americans are going to die.

1941
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:04,060
包括正在和你通话的这个人
Including the one talking to you right now.

1942
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:15,840
你看到了吗 哥们
You see that, dude?

1943
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:17,310
有人在那边的石头上面
There's guys on those rocks over there.

1944
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:20,700
那里什么都没有
There's nothing there.

1945
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,000
你眼睛花了
Your eyes are playing tricks, man.

1946
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:25,230
去休息一会吧
Why don't you go take a break?

1947
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,780
不 我还行
No. I'm okay.

1948
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:30,880
泰格 去休息一下
Tig, take a break.

1949
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:41,520
泰格 下去吧 我来替你
Hey, Tig. Go on down, man. I'll spell you.

1950
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,610
那些外交安全局的家伙
Oh, those State guys.

1951
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:47,910
戴夫在C栋楼顶
Dave up on C,

1952
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,060
你真该看看他的神情
you should see the look in his eyes.

1953
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,190
这些家伙这辈子
These guys are gonna

1954
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:55,240
都忘不了今晚的经历
relive this night for the rest of their lives.

1955
01:48:56,650 --> 01:48:59,410
要说我的心态 从未有那种感觉
My whole mindset? Never feel that.

1956
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:02,170
开枪 杀人 总是如此
You go down shooting, balls out, every time.

1957
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:06,470
你怎么样 兄弟
How you doing, brother?

1958
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:10,280
停火间隙才是最难受的 不是吗
Down time's the worst, isn't it?

1959
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:13,180
肾上腺素消退之后
Adrenaline leaves and

1960
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:14,710
你就会开始胡思乱想
your mind just starts to wander.

1961
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:15,840
没错
Oh, yeah.

1962
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:20,440
今天晚上我还没有想过我的家人
I haven't thought about my family once tonight.

1963
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:25,930
现在我很想念她们
Thinking about them now.

1964
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:28,950
就在此时此地
Up here in the middle of all this,

1965
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:34,880
我在想我的女儿们
I'm thinking about my girls, man.

1966
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,350
我在想
Thinking

1967
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:40,340
她们日后会怎么评论我
what would they say about me?

1968
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:44,920
"他死于一个他没必要去的地方"
"He died in a place he didn't need to be,"

1969
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:49,380
"死于一场他不知为何而战的战争"
"In a battle over something he doesn't understand,"

1970
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,280
"死于一个对他没有任何意义的国家"
"In a country that meant nothing to him."

1971
01:49:58,730 --> 01:50:00,550
每次我回家 回到贝基和姑娘们身边时
Every time I go home to becky and those girls,

1972
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:01,530
我会想就是这样了
I think this is it.

1973
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:04,110
我要留在这里
I'm gonna stay.

1974
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:08,560
然后事情来了 最后我又回到这里
And then something happens and I end up back here.

1975
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:12,600
为什么会这样 为什么我不能回家呢
Why is that? Why can't I go home?

1976
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:16,280
为什么我不能回家然后留在家里呢
Why can't I go home and just stay there?

1977
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,470
战士们可不是训练来退役的 杰克
Warriors aren't trained to retire, Jack.

1978
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:24,140
贝基怀孕了
Becky's pregnant.

1979
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:25,870
你没开玩笑吧
You kidding me?

1980
01:50:27,530 --> 01:50:28,780
她今天告诉我的
She told me today.

1981
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,700
那不能是我们的最后通话
And that can't be the last call.

1982
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:35,840
不能是最后通话
That can't be the last call,

1983
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:36,710
因为我现在坐在这里
'cause I'm sitting up here

1984
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:37,210
想象着
and I'm thinking about

1985
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,850
由别人来抚养我的孩子们
some other guy raising these girls.

1986
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,960
兄弟 我很抱歉
Man, I'm sorry.

1987
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:45,740
- 不不 - 我不应该...
- No, no, hey... - I shouldn't have...

1988
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,460
不 兄弟 没关系
Mmm-mmm. No, man, no... It's all right.

1989
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:51,030
我明白 好吗
I get it. Okay?

1990
01:50:52,190 --> 01:50:53,190
你想陪伴他们
You go to them.

1991
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,490
我知道这种处境是什么感受
I know what it's like to be in a place like this,

1992
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,710
让别的男人抚养你的孩子
let another man raise your children.

1993
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:01,910
年轻的时候
When I was young,

1994
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:03,940
我参军献身国家伟业
I was giving myself to something bigger.

1995
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:08,280
杰克 现在这伟大事业结束了
Jack, that something bigger's gone now.

1996
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:15,610
但你刚出生的儿子呢
But your new son?

1997
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:19,010
卡伊是你的第二次机会
Kai is your second chance.

1998
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:21,830
我应该还算一个不错的父亲吧
I might actually not be a half-bad father.

1999
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:27,430
"所有的神 天堂和地狱
"All the gods, all the heavens,

2000
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:29,140
都在你的心中"
all the hells are within you."

2001
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:32,110
什么意思
What is that?

2002
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,510
之前布恩告诉我的
Something Boon dropped on me earlier.

2003
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:40,640
之后这句话就一直在我脑海里盘旋
And it's just been going around in my head all night.

2004
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:44,590
我们有几个问题现在弄清楚了
We have some clarity on a couple of issues.

2005
01:51:45,070 --> 01:51:47,640
的黎波里的小队已经解决了机场的争端
The Tripoli team has cleared the airport,

2006
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,230
他们正在来的路上
and they are on their way.

2007
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:54,170
你没开玩笑吧 太及时了
You've got to be kidding me. It's about time.

2008
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:56,670
我们也得到了证实
We also have confirmation.

2009
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,290
确实是史蒂文斯大使
It is Ambassador Stevens.

2010
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:03,170
但是之前报告中说他还活着的消息
But the earlier report that he was admitted alive

2011
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:05,640
并不属实
was inaccurate.

2012
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,340
他在别墅后面被人发现
He was apparently found in the back of the villa

2013
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:11,860
被一群利比亚人送去了医院
and brought to the hospital by a crowd of Libyans.

2014
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:14,730
他死于吸入过多烟尘
Cause of death is smoke inhalation.

2015
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,480
操
Shit.

2016
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:20,870
我们本可以救他的
You know, we could've saved him

2017
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:23,350
如果我们接到求救就行动
if we'd gone when we got the call.

2018
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:24,750
我们本可以救下他们俩的
We could've saved them both.

2019
01:52:25,070 --> 01:52:25,980
没错
Yep.

2020
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:31,070
敌人肯定会想出对策
You know, they're gonna get this figured out.

2021
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:33,540
下次会开着武装皮卡来进攻
Come at us with technicals next.

2022
01:52:34,670 --> 01:52:35,900
到时候我们只能离开楼顶
We'll have to get down off this roof

2023
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,160
和他们正面交火
and engage them direct.

2024
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:40,310
是的 我知道
Yeah, I know.

2025
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,370
我从未真正感到过害怕
I never really get scared.

2026
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:52,890
这是不是很奇怪
Is that weird?

2027
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:55,630
在枪林弹雨中
Whenever bullets start to fly,

2028
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:56,870
我总感觉自己受到了庇护
I always feel protected.

2029
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:58,890
你知道 这就像是...
You know, like it's...

2030
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:00,730
只要我做的是正确的事情
As long as I'm doing the right thing,

2031
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:02,910
上帝会保佑我
God'll take care of me.

2032
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:06,290
但这听上去很疯狂 对吧
But that's crazy, right?

2033
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,740
和你说的其他事情一样疯狂
Not any more than everything else you say.

2034
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,670
希望上帝也有幽默感
Hope God has a sense of humor.

2035
01:53:13,890 --> 01:53:14,690
没错
Yeah.

2036
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:16,820
我想我们很快就能知道了
I guess we'll find out soon enough.

2037
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,760
今天我和家人聊得很开心
I had a good call home today.

2038
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:22,570
然后呢
Yeah?

2039
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:23,800
我和孩子们通了话
Talked to my kids.

2040
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:25,730
我也是
Me, too.

2041
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,340
我们需要一个在A栋的人
Hey, we need somebody on Building A

2042
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:28,200
监视入侵者
eyeballing our visitors.

2043
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,470
好吧 就是我了
Yep. That's me.

2044
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:32,680
你还好吧 兄弟
You good, brother?

2045
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:33,700
没事
Yep.

2046
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:35,860
喂 伙计
Hey, man.

2047
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:38,660
这挺好玩的 是吧
It's been fun, right?

2048
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:41,260
是的
Yeah.

2049
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:46,340
挺好玩的
It's been fun.

2050
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,600
什么 你是说他们不知道具体地址
What, do you mean they don't know where it is?

2051
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:58,530
我们的利比亚朋友真帮不上什么忙
Our Libyan friends here aren't much help.

2052
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:01,960
基地 我们迷路了
Okay, annex, we're officially lost.

2053
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:05,160
谷歌和苹果语音助手都不知道你们的位置
Neither Google or Siri know where the fuck you are.

2054
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:08,960
告诉的黎波里小队 我在画圈显示我们的位置
Let Tripoli ops know I'm lassoing our location.

2055
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:12,690
现在应该看得见红外线在画圈了
There should be an IR lasso visible right now.

2056
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:16,040
那里 就在前面 我看见了
There. There it is up ahead. I see it.

2057
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:19,920
哥们 我可以吞下好几个煎饼
Man, I could crush some pancakes.

2058
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:23,890
抹着黄油 再来点鲜奶油
Smothered with butter. Some of that whipped cream.

2059
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:26,480
撒点巧克力屑 我现在什么都吃得下
Chocolate chips. I'd do any of it right now.

2060
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:27,620
喂 伙计们
Hey, guys.

2061
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:29,520
我不知道现在说这个是否合适
I don't know if this is an awkward time to tell you,

2062
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:30,660
但离开领事馆后
but I've had to take a crap

2063
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:32,300
我拉过一泡大便
ever since we left the consulate.

2064
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,450
这信息量太大了 哥们
Way too much information, brother.

2065
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:39,380
喂 主管
Hey, Chief.

2066
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:41,690
我们在等的车不止一辆吧
We're expecting more than one car, correct?

2067
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:45,000
我不知道有任何援军要来 一点消息也没有
I am not aware of any friendlies. No word.

2068
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:46,510
我现在看见三个人
I got three Tangos in a car

2069
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:47,690
坐着一辆车朝前门来了
coming up to the front gate, right now.

2070
01:54:47,710 --> 01:54:48,750
车速很快
Coming in hot.

2071
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:51,950
他们停下了
They stopped.

2072
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:53,480
来吧
Come on.

2073
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:54,770
他最好带着武器
He better have a weapon.

2074
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:56,010
快掏枪吧
Show me a gun.

2075
01:54:56,030 --> 01:54:57,200
可能是汽车炸弹
Could be a car bomb.

2076
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:01,140
不是 没枪 只拿出了手机
Nope. No gun, just a phone.

2077
01:55:02,850 --> 01:55:04,460
我要干了这家伙 隆
I want to shoot this guy, Rone.

2078
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:06,540
隆 我要打爆他的脸
Rone, I'm gonna shoot him in the face.

2079
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:10,630
他在干吗 他掉头了
What's he doing? He's turning around.

2080
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:13,680
他开走了
He's pulling out.

2081
01:55:15,410 --> 01:55:16,320
走了
He's taking off.

2082
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:20,480
可能是用手机
Could be someone using their cell phone

2083
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:21,770
来获取靶点坐标
to get target coordinates.

2084
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:32,650
好吧 怪事又开始了
All right. Weird shit's starting to happen now.

2085
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:37,300
 德克萨斯独立战争中最重要的一次战役 发生于1835-1836年
阿拉莫要塞最后被围困了13天 以几乎全部德克萨斯人的壮烈牺牲而告终

2086
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,420
我快受够这场
I've had just about enough of

2087
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:36,620
2012版的阿拉莫战役了
this 2012 Alamo bullshit.

2088
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:40,250
不能现在就离开这里吗
Can we get the fuck out of here now?

2089
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:10,500
我的一个耳膜破了 有点聋
I know I blew an eardrum earlier, but

2090
01:56:11,390 --> 01:56:12,810
吟诵是不是全停了
did all the chanting just stop?

2091
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,480
不是好现象
That can't be good.

2092
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:19,090
伙计们 情况不妙 游骑兵们都知道
Guys, this sucks. Every Ranger knows

2093
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:21,090
法国人和印第安人总是在拂晓发动进攻
dawn is when the French and Indians attack.

2094
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:24,490
我觉得今晚很走运 坦托
I'm feeling lucky tonight, Tanto.

2095
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:30,880
主管
Chief.

2096
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:32,720
我们等的是卡车
Are we expecting some trucks,

2097
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:34,310
或大型武装车吗
or big mounted technicals?

2098
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:38,740
友军 友军 装甲部队到了
Blue, blue! Cavalry's here!

2099
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:40,080
虽然看上去火力不太够
Yeah. You're looking a little light,

2100
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:41,270
但依然非常欢迎
but welcome to the party!

2101
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:43,570
中东永远不会让你们失望
Middle East never lets you down.

2102
01:56:43,790 --> 01:56:46,450
品貌出众 组织有序 导航准确

2103
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:48,410
让我好想喝上一杯
Makes me need a fucking drink!

2104
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,040
海豹突击队员的别称

2105
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,000
我的蛙人兄弟在哪里
Where's my frogman?

2106
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:51,520
C楼 顶上
Building C, up top!

2107
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:52,990
我们可以撤了吗
We gonna exfil now?

2108
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:55,570
带我们去的黎波里 兄弟 一定让你一醉方休
Get us to Tripoli, brother, I'll get you wasted.

2109
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,510
利比亚之盾联盟 是2012年成立的反卡扎菲武装力量组织 但利比亚政府认定其为恐怖组织和伊斯兰原教旨主义军事组织

2110
01:56:58,150 --> 01:56:59,880
我是利比亚之盾的指挥官
I'm the Commander of the Libyan Shield.

2111

2112

长官 我们奉命来销毁
Sir, we're tasked with

2113
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:03,680
敏感文件

2114
01:57:03,970 --> 01:57:06,120
- 差点就来晚了 - 你好 格伦
- Not a moment too soon. - Hey, Glen!

2115
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:07,930
谁喊来了机场专车啊
Anyone call an airport limo?

2116
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,440
近来可好 小老弟
What's up, brother Bub?

2117
01:57:09,730 --> 01:57:11,090
见到你真开心 兄弟
Good to see you, brother.

2118
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,810
抱歉来晚了 在礼品店耽搁了一会
Sorry I'm late. I got hung up in the gift shop.

2119
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:15,830
你们这真是一团糟啊
Oh. You guys made a mess up here.

2120
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:17,250
本该等你去救大使的
Would've waited for you,

2121
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:20,010
但无线电里哭天喊地的救命
but people crying and dying over the radio, man.

2122
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:21,490
我们实在听不下去
We didn't have the heart for it.

2123
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:22,090
隆
Hey, Rone,

2124
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:23,980
很想告诉你一切都结束了 但实在不行
I'd like to tell you it's over, but it isn't.

2125
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:26,450
这有二十四名中情局职员
The 24 CIA staffers here,

2126
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:27,530
五位外交安全局的

2127
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:28,990
六名全球反应人员 外加我们
plus six GRS, plus us.

2128
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:30,470
明白 人太多了
I get it. Too many.

2129
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,790
喷气式飞机装不下
There's no room in the jet.

2130
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:33,200
你们能在这
You think you can hold things down here

2131
01:57:33,230 --> 01:57:34,150
再撑几个小时吗
for a few more hours?

2132
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,520
告诉你吧
I'll tell you what.

2133
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:38,140
这些都是勇猛无畏的斗士
These are some hellish warriors.

2134
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,910
无论何时与他们并肩作战都是我的荣幸
I'd be lucky to have their back any day.

2135
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:42,640
- 喂 戴夫 - 在

2138

我去拿我的东西
I'll grab my gear.

2139
01:57:49,330 --> 01:57:50,560
嗨 席尔瓦在哪儿
Hey, where's Silva at?

2140
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:52,520
在D楼顶上 - 是吗
- Over on D. - Yeah?

2141
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,120
我没想到你会来
I didn't think you were coming.

2142
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:56,710
还以为你有更好的差事呢
Figured you had something better to do.

2143
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:57,840
的确有 哥们
Dude, I was.

2144
01:57:58,960 --> 01:57:59,890
都是那句
Then there's all that

2145
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:02,210
"绝不抛下海豹战友"的鬼话
"Never leave a brother SEAL behind" Bullshit,

2146
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,320
让我来到了这里
so here I am.

2147
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:05,990
我们要去机场的路还远呢
Long ride to the airport ahead of us.

2148
01:58:06,010 --> 01:58:07,390
我去看看他们在耽搁什么
I'll see what the hold-up is.

2149
01:58:12,670 --> 01:58:14,960
喂喂 你们到底去哪

你们听到了吗
Did anyone else hear that?

2153
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:33,200
伙计们 那是迫击炮吗
Guys, is that a mortar?

2154
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,750
迫击炮来了 快躲起来
Mortars incoming. Get cover!

2155
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:09,170
我中弹了
