And I'm gonna need you
to come with me right now.

790

Look, lady,
I'm not interested.

791
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:05,750
Really gettin'
into your cups here.

792
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:07,318
Why would I go with you?

793
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:10,154
Because, unfortunately,

794
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:11,522
I need you,

795
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:15,627
and even more unfortunately,
my entire world needs you.

796

You two gonna fuck or fight?

797

802
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:31,242
would've really hurt me
by now.

803

on the tick-tick.

-Whoa, whoa.

You don't want this.

You're right. I don't.

831

One Anchor Being
coming right up!

832

On your left, baby girl.

833
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,210
This Logan has the same

even-musicals look.

835

And bonus, he's actually
wearing a costume

836
00:32:43,614 --> 00:32:44,850
like he's not
embarrassed to be

837
00:32:44,883 --> 00:32:46,250
in a superhero movie for once.

838
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:47,920
I don't understand.

839
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:49,154
You said my universe is dying

840
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:51,622
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

841

-Well, problem solved.
<i>-</i> My God.

842
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:58,730
You actually think you can
replace an Anchor Being

843
00:32:58,764 --> 00:33:00,732
with this?

844
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:03,334
I wouldn't have accepted
any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

845
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,369
But you have outdone yourself

846
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:07,605
and brought me
the worst Wolverine!

847
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:08,874
What do you mean,
the worst one?

848
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:10,374
Mr. Wilson.

849
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:14,378
This Wolverine let down
his entire world.

850
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:16,782
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

851
00:33:16,815 --> 00:33:18,050
And what he did,

852
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,450
well,

853
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:21,787
some things are just
beyond forgiveness.

854
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,423
Okay.

855
00:33:25,456 --> 00:33:28,359
How do I... How do I make
this right? I'll do anything.

856
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:31,362
I gave you
a chance at greatness.

857
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:33,999
Because my superiors
deemed you "special."

858
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:35,500
Clearly not special
in a good way.

859
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:36,567
Apparently you have some

860
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,771
important future purpose
to serve.

861
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:39,905
With Thor. He holds me.

862
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:41,739
But I did my duty.

863
00:33:41,774 --> 00:33:43,809
I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

864
00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:45,811
And instead of
accepting my offering

865
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:48,312
with humility and gratitude,
you broke my nose.

866
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:49,380
[sighs] It looks great.

867
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:51,349
And you decimated
dozens of my men

868
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:52,985
with the exhumed corpse
of a hero.

869
00:33:53,018 --> 00:33:55,353
Dishonoring not only
his remains but his memory.

870
00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:56,721
What are you, the Internet?

871
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:58,991
Your world is dying!

872
00:33:59,024 --> 00:34:00,391
Thank you very much.

873
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:01,726
And there's no stopping it.

[muffled]
The humane thing to do

875
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:06,564
is to make it quick.

876
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:08,499
Is the thought
of vaporizing my universe

877
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:09,802
making you peckish?

878
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:10,969
I'm eating my feelings.

879
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:12,603
I'm about to lose everything
that I've ever cared about

880
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:15,808
because that hairy thundercunt
from down undercunt

881
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:16,775
finally dies,

right behind me, isn't he?

As for you,
I wanna talk to your boss.

886

I want you to get him
on the phone

887

and you tell him,
her, or them,

Every time one of us
has gone up against her,

1731
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:14,900
they die.

1732
01:10:14,933 --> 01:10:17,702
The Punisher, the Quicksilver,
the Daredevil.

1733
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:19,404
[Deadpool] Daredevil?
I'm so sorry.

1734
01:10:19,438 --> 01:10:20,839
-It's fine.
-[Deadpool] Okay.

1735
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:26,144
Even that sweet, baby angel,
Johnny Storm.

1736
01:10:26,178 --> 01:10:27,611
He up and gone missing like,

1737
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:29,580
what, two days ago?

1738
01:10:29,613 --> 01:10:31,917
[Deadpool] Ugh. That's so sad.

1739
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:34,685
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1740
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:35,854
[Wolverine chuckles]

1741
01:10:35,887 --> 01:10:38,123
Look, there's...
there's strength in numbers.

1742
01:10:38,156 --> 01:10:39,257
All right? Us...

1743
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,624
plus, you guys.
We can put Cassandra

1744
01:10:40,658 --> 01:10:42,928
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1745
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:44,628
I know what it means
to feel self-doubt.

1746
01:10:44,662 --> 01:10:46,198
-I don't feel that at all.
-I'm good.

1747
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:48,467
[Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1748
01:10:48,499 --> 01:10:50,035
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1749
01:10:50,068 --> 01:10:51,403
[Deadpool] You guys
may not have been able

1750
01:10:51,436 --> 01:10:53,171
to save your universes.

1751
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:55,374
But you can avenge them.

1752
01:10:55,407 --> 01:10:56,707
It's what Johnny
would have wanted.

1753
01:10:56,741 --> 01:10:59,778
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1754
01:11:00,578 --> 01:11:01,813
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

1755
01:11:01,847 --> 01:11:03,815
Dickhead here talked him
into a team-up,

1756
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:06,451
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1757
01:11:06,485 --> 01:11:07,786
[Deadpool] No, no, no.
We don't know that.

1758
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:10,022
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1759
01:11:10,055 --> 01:11:12,824
If he survived that,
he is prayin' for death.

1760
01:11:12,858 --> 01:11:14,493
[Deadpool] Thank you,
Doctor Wolverine!

1761
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:16,694
-Spill it!
-What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1762
01:11:16,727 --> 01:11:17,896
Talk or I'm gonna
start dealin'.

1763
01:11:17,929 --> 01:11:19,597
[Deadpool] Okay. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

1764
01:11:20,065 --> 01:11:20,899
Look.

1765
01:11:20,932 --> 01:11:23,368
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1766
01:11:23,402 --> 01:11:25,170
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1767
01:11:25,203 --> 01:11:27,339
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1768
01:11:27,372 --> 01:11:30,308
while the soil
greedily drank his blood.
It was horrible.

1769
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:32,110
He was like a brother to me.

1770
01:11:32,144 --> 01:11:35,280
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1771
01:11:35,313 --> 01:11:36,348
-[laughs]
-Look, maybe you couldn't

1772
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:37,816
save your worlds, but...

1773
01:11:37,849 --> 01:11:40,584
but Jesus Christ,
you can save mine!

1774
01:11:40,618 --> 01:11:43,088
I don't give a shit
about your world, but

1775
01:11:43,121 --> 01:11:46,058
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1776
01:11:46,091 --> 01:11:47,993
we can get back in
and take her down.

1777
01:11:48,026 --> 01:11:50,996
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chere.</i>

1778
01:11:51,029 --> 01:11:52,998
[Deadpool] If we can block
her psychic powers,

1779
01:11:53,031 --> 01:11:54,900
we can get a leg up.
I know it.

1780
01:11:54,933 --> 01:11:56,968
Now, I know Magneto's dead.

1781
01:11:57,002 --> 01:11:59,603
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1782
01:11:59,637 --> 01:12:01,672
-around here somewhere--
-Cassandra melted the helmet.

1783
01:12:01,705 --> 01:12:02,874
-[Deadpool] Fuck!
-After she killed him.

1784
01:12:02,908 --> 01:12:04,876
-[Deadpool] Fuck!
-She don't play.

1785
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:06,344
She knows that helmet
was the only way

1786
01:12:06,378 --> 01:12:08,013
to protect anyone
from her powers.

1787
01:12:08,046 --> 01:12:09,915
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's,

1788
01:12:09,948 --> 01:12:11,183
but he works for Cassandra.

1789
01:12:11,216 --> 01:12:12,716
[Deadpool]
Juggernaut's helmet.
That's it.

1790
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,419
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off

1791
01:12:14,453 --> 01:12:15,854
without that dome
gonna come off wit'it.

1792
01:12:15,887 --> 01:12:17,155
[Deadpool] I'm so sorry,
beautiful.

1793
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:18,056
I want this to be gentle.

1794
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:20,358
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1795
01:12:20,392 --> 01:12:23,661
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1796
01:12:24,863 --> 01:12:27,833
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1797
01:12:28,867 --> 01:12:30,902
Let's face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1798
01:12:30,936 --> 01:12:32,736
Or never learned about us.

1799
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:34,206
The heroes we were.

1800
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:35,540
Lives we saved.

1801
01:12:35,574 --> 01:12:36,942
Or wanted to save.

1802
01:12:36,975 --> 01:12:39,010
Maybe these two
are our chance.

1803
01:12:39,044 --> 01:12:40,345
[gurgling]

1804
01:12:40,378 --> 01:12:42,114
To be remembered.

1805
01:12:42,147 --> 01:12:43,215
The way we deserve.

1806
01:12:44,349 --> 01:12:45,417
[Deadpool] Yes.

1807
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:47,252
An ending.

1808
01:12:47,285 --> 01:12:48,487
-Legacy.
-[Deadpool] Yes!

1809
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,988
Yes! Let this man cook.

1810
01:12:50,021 --> 01:12:51,523
This is what
I'm talking about.

1811
01:12:51,556 --> 01:12:53,525
Big slow-motion fights,
sad music.

1812
01:12:53,558 --> 01:12:54,759
Everybody working together.

1813
01:12:54,793 --> 01:12:56,627
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1814
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,797
-Who's ready?
-I was born ready.

1815
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,098
[Deadpool] Yes!
Gambit?

1816
01:13:00,132 --> 01:13:01,066
I ain't know my daddy,

1817
01:13:01,099 --> 01:13:03,068
but I'm sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

1818
01:13:03,101 --> 01:13:05,003
[Deadpool] Jesus Christ,
that is graphic.

1819
01:13:05,036 --> 01:13:06,972
Yeah. He was layin' them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1820
01:13:07,005 --> 01:13:09,007
and I shot out there
and I said, "What's up, Doc?"

1821
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,476
[Deadpool laughs]
Johnny must have loved you.

1822
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:13,778
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1823
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:15,046
The name's Laura.

1824
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,883
-Let's fucking go.
-[Deadpool] Let's fucking go!

1825
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,151
It's on like chicken and corn.

1826
01:13:19,184 --> 01:13:20,684
-[Deadpool] Yeah!
-We're doing this.

1827
01:13:20,718 --> 01:13:21,786
You're all fuckin' dead.

1828

Hey, hey. I'm not lookin'
for company. Get out of here.

1832
01:13:40,305 --> 01:13:41,806
You remind me of him.

1833
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,674
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1834

-Wasn't finished.

it mattered the most.

you're a good man, Logan.

You might not know it,
but apparently,

I'm the worst Logan.

1843
01:14:07,165 --> 01:14:09,067
I got to have a life
because of you.

1844
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:13,704
I got to grow up
because of you.

1845
01:14:15,706 --> 01:14:17,275
A lot of kids did.

1846
01:14:17,309 --> 01:14:19,444
A lot of kids didn't grow up
because of me.

1847
01:14:21,646 --> 01:14:23,248
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1848
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,651
That suit says different.

1849
01:14:26,685 --> 01:14:28,820
-Yeah. Do you like it?
-Mm.

1850
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:32,390
Scott used to beg me
to wear it.

1851
01:14:34,659 --> 01:14:37,262
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1852
01:14:39,331 --> 01:14:41,366
All of them.

1853
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:45,136
They wanted me to be part
of the team, but I wouldn't.

1854
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:48,473
Told 'em they all look
fucking ridiculous. I mean...

1855
01:14:50,308 --> 01:14:53,078
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1856
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:00,785
And then one day,
while I was off on my own,

1857
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:02,087
the humans came...

1858

and went mutant hunting.

I can guess the rest.

No, no, let me...

1861
01:15:08,994 --> 01:15:10,195
Let me say it. I...

1862
01:15:12,797 --> 01:15:13,999
I need to say it.

1863
01:15:16,468 --> 01:15:19,137
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar,

1864
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,472
it was too late.

And what I did.

without you.
