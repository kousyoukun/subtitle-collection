1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,415
That logo music just

2
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,708
gets you pumped, right?

3
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,143
I'm sorry, I'm just excited to be here.

4
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,291
It's been a while.

5
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,707
For a long time, I

6
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,916
wasn't sure I'd ever be back.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,957
Disney bought Fox, there was a whole

8
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,125
boring rights issue,

9
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,166
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

10
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,833
But then, it turned out they wanted me,

11
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,624
the one guy who shouldn't

12
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,958
even have his own movie.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,166
Much less a franchise.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,916
You have all so stupid.

15
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,999
Look, we know the title of this thing, so

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,160
I know what you're wondering.

17
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,207
How are we going to do this without

18
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,041
dishonoring Logan's memory?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And I'll tell you how.

20
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,333
We're not.

21
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:13,500
Holy.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,875
I'm going to let you

23
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:15,875
in on a little secret.

24
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,250
Wolverine is not dead.

25
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,332
Sure, it made for a perfect

26
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,999
ending to a very sad story,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but that's not how

28
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,999
regenerative healing factors work.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,707
You think I want to be out here in

30
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,708
beautiful downtown North Dakota,

31
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,436
digging up the one and only Wolverine?

32
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:31,875
No, thank you.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,833
But the fate of my

34
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,125
entire world is at stake.

35
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,040
He may not be living his best life, but

36
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,833
he sure as hell ain't dead.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Bingo.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yahtzee.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,416
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Damn it!

41
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,833
Son of a bitch!

42
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:10,166
Fuck! Motherfucker!

43
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,333
My world is fucked!

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
That was weird.

45
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,958
I'm much calmer now.

46
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,000
Look, I'm not a man of science,

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,416
but you seem incredibly passed away.

48
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,416
But it's good to see ya.

49
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,082
I gotta be honest, I've always wanted to

50
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,083
ride with you, Logan.

51
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,540
You and me getting into a

52
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,416
Deadpool and a Wolverine.

53
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,083
Just fucking shit up.

54
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,416
Can you imagine the fun,

55
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,041
the chaos, the residuals?

56
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,708
Could I of mine?

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,374
It's nothing that'll bring me back to

58
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,250
life faster than a

59
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,958
big bag of matted cash.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,791
Me too, Hugh.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,750
No, no, no, no.

62
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,374
Ugh, he had to get all

63
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,416
noble and die for real.

64
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,291
God damn it!

65
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:06,000
I could really use your help right now.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wait!

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm warning you! I'm not alone!

68
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,291
Wade Winston Wilson!

69
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,499
You're under arrest by

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,833
the Time Variance Authority.

71
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,708
With too many crimes for this, come out!

72
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,790
Oh, you're the courtesy

73
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,458
death fighting you dame player.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Last chance!

75
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,291
Throw out your weapons

76
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,458
and come out peacefully!

77
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,208
I'm not gonna give you my weapons!

78
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,416
But I promise not to use them.

79
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,083
There are 206 bones in the human body.

80
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,541
207 if I'm watching Gossip Girl.

81
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,000
Here we go, maximum effort.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll give away every item.

83
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:07,999
There comes the

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,916
You know it's just a nightmare

85
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,041
I'm probably gonna start a fight now

86
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,458
Now this can't be right

87
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,791
Baby, come on

88
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,750
Nothing can be sweet

89
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,125
No time for a little bit of a crisis

90
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,416
Now it's time to leave

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,833
And make it alone

92
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,666
I know that I can't take no more

93
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,166
I ain't no man

94
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,125
I don't wanna see you

95
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,625
Back for me, bye bye bye

96
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,083
I'm gonna be a fool for you

97
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,616
But you're just another player

98
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,041
You came into it

99
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,500
You shouldn't be hating me

100
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,291
But it ain't no matter

101
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,708
You can bye bye bye

102
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:51,291
Bye bye

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,208
I don't really wanna make it tough

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,500
I just wanna take a nap

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,541
I'm myself crazy

106
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,500
But it ain't no lie

107
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,041
You can bye bye bye

108
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,750
You're gonna be thirsty

109
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,500
With the truth of the law

110
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,666
Girl, your mother will come

111
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,500
Better not ask from outside your box.

112
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,416
You're gonna be thirsty

113
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,208
Come on

114
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,583
I just know that I can't take no more

115
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,333
You ain't no man

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,125
I wanna see you

117
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,541
Back for me, bye bye bye

118
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,166
Bye bye

119
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm gonna be a fool for you

120
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,950
But you're just another player

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,958
You came into it

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,250
You made me a fool

123
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,749
You made me a fool

124
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,291
Bye bye bye bye

125
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,083
I'm gonna make you tough

126
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
I just wanna take a nap

127
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,875
And I'm gonna be a fool

128
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm myself crazy

129
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,375
But it ain't no lie

130
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,875
You're gonna be a fool for you

131
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,958
I don't wanna be your fool

132
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,791
In this game for two

133
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,583
So I need a man

134
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,950
Come on, let's make it better.

135
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,333
Back for me, I'm crazy

136
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,375
But it ain't no lie

137
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,500
You made me a fool

138
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:12,083
You made me a fool

139
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:14,083
I'm myself crazy

140
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,666
But you made me a fool

141
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,583
You made me a fool

142
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:19,666
You made me a fool

143
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,000
You made me a fool

144
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,083
You made me a fool

145
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:23,166
I'm gonna be a fool

146
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,791
I just wanna take a nap

147
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,625
I'm myself crazy

148
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,666
But it ain't no lie

149
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,500
But, but, but, but

150
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:43,375
I am soaking wet right now.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,582
To be clear, I'm not

152
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,583
proud of any of this.

153
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,875
The wanton violence,

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
the whiff of necrophilia,

155
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,999
it isn't who I am, it

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,125
isn't who I wanna be.

157
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,583
Who I wanna be?

158
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,458
Well, to help you understand that,

159
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
I gotta take you back.

160
00:06:58,916 --> 00:06:59,666
My little joy ride I

161
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,041
took through space and time,

162
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,166
to the day that changed everything.

163
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,791
I can't believe I'm finally here.

164
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,541
I've waited for this moment for so long.

165
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you, sir, for seeing me.

166
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,457
I firmly believe that my

167
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,207
services could be of great use

168
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,208
to your organization.

169
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,915
Now, I know I was caught masturbating

170
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,166
in the lobby of Stark Tower.

171
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:34,875
Shmash the banner?

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,375
I'm sure you did that.

173
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,832
I'm sorry, what was that?

174
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,833
No, I'm sorry.

175
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,124
That's when you get

176
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,290
those toy hulk hands, right?

177
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:41,916
And then you just, you

178
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,916
look down and you just,

179
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,290
you brace yourself and

180
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,957
you ravage the midsection.

181
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,416
I get it, okay, thank you.

182
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,333
The picture's painted.

183
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,375
You get the gist.

184
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,025
What exactly brings you here today?

185
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,166
Well, okay, I care.

186
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,833
I know I'm turning

187
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,124
everything into a joke,

188
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,875
but I care and I want to use that feeling

189
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,125
for something important.

190
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,875
I don't want to matter.

191
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,083
And to show my girl that I matter.

192
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,499
And, you know, I feel like I'm wasting

193
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
the good stuff here.

194
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,250
Is the man not going to be joining us?

195
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:21,458
The man?

196
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,833
Yeah, I should say this if he's going to.

197
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,207
As far as you can tell

198
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,583
right now, I'm the man.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The man is me.

200
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,708
I am the man in this circumstance.

201
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
And he doesn't do this

202
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
kind of thing anymore.

203
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:34,500
Candidates?

204
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Meetings.

205
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,666
Entry-level meetings.

206
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,208
Entry-level?

207
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,416
Aren't you the chauffeur?

208
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,833
I, maybe.

209
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,500
Common misconception,

210
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,165
I did begin my career

211
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,375
as Mr. Stark's driver.

212
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,207
I quickly pivoted to

213
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,208
the head of security.

214
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:47,914
The head of security?

215
00:08:47,915 --> 00:08:48,750
The head of security, of

216
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,458
course, yes, yes, yes, yes.

217
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,333
And why I am vetting your resume.

218
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,124
You seem to have left out whether or not

219
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,290
you had any experience

220
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,333
as a member of a team.

221
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,832
Could you maybe add a

222
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,873
little bit of perspective?

223
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,124
Oh, yes, of course.

224
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,750
I was Special Forces, but I was mainly,

225
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,708
I was team leader,

226
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,000
founder, really, of X-Force.

227
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,083
Sadly, they all perished in action.

228
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,495
How exactly did that happen?

229
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,708
Well, the police say

230
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,874
gravity, but just between us,

231
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,515
they didn't test well in the focus group.

232
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,868
They were to go to the cable.

233
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I

234
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,540
can see this isn't going on.

235
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,041
Please stop writing.

236
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,416
I'm just, I want to be an Avenger.

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,875
I want to be an Avenger.

238
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,820
Why do you want to be an Avenger?

239
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,499
To look around you, I mean,

240
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,833
they're the best of the best.

241
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,916
And what they do matters.

242
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,416
I need to be an Avenger.

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,332
Sir, that girl is kind

244
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,291
of had a bit of a shtick,

245
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,332
and if I don't, you

246
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,374
know, turn things around

247
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,041
and do something with my gifts,

248
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,083
I don't think it's going

249
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,165
to really work out for me,

250
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,208
and I wouldn't blame her.

251
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,790
Avengers are a very

252
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,790
unique group of superheroes

253
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,249
that stand for something

254
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,540
more than just fighting

255
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,958
and wearing costumes.

256
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,041
I mean, people look up

257
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,958
to us. Kids look up to us.

258
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,291
I'm sorry, us?

259
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,333
I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.

260
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,573
Avengers adjacent, technically.

261
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,125
Oh, what's your

262
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,526
superpower? Is it parallel parking?

263
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,333
I am so sorry. That was cruel.

264
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,708
I lash out when I'm

265
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,949
nervous. It won't happen again.

266
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,281
Let's cut to the chase. Please.

267
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,749
You just said moments ago

268
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,333
that you wanted to be an Avenger

269
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,875
because you need it.

270
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,375
Yes, sir, I do.

271
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,833
But the Avengers don't do

272
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,500
the job because they need it.

273
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,390
They do the job because people need them.

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
Do you see the distinction?

275
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,458
Yes, sir.

276
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,165
Please, Mr. Hogan, I don't

277
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,476
want to spend the rest of my life

278
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,875
like an annoying one-trick pony.

279
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,333
All right.

280
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, my God. You're standing.

281
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,458
Yeah, now's the time that we stand.

282
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,291
Damn it.

283
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,665
The problem might be that

284
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,916
you're reaching a little too high.

285
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,223
Aim for the middle and you'll never miss.

286
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,457
Right? I think you got a good heart. I

287
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,538
believe what you're saying.

288
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,832
But not everybody's a world-saving type.

289
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,375
I'm not. I'm happy. Right?

290
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,625
I found my place.

291
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,625
Find your place.

292
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,158
All right. Get back out there.

293
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,000
We'll keep an eye. Good luck.

294
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,458
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

295
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,708
Catch the car. I want to hit Shake Shack.

296
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,540
Rejection makes me hungry.

297
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,125
No, no, no. Please.

298
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,958
No, no, no. Okay.

299
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,125
You know what they say?

300
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,791
When one door closes,

301
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,583
your locker at work opens.

302
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,124
Let's go sell some certified

303
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,958
pre-owned vehicles, motherf...

304
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,499
Technically, the

305
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,833
carnival's not a minivan.

306
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,791
It's an MPV.

307
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,916
So how does the Kia

308
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,333
compare to the Honda Odyssey?

309
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,855
The Odyssey? That's a great question.

310
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,250
It doesn't fucking suck.

311
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,166
You know, you can't answer

312
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,367
the question without swearing.

313
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,416
I'm sorry. Tell me I don't have kids.

314
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,526
Not that I haven't dreamt of that.

315
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,583
You don't have a lot of natural sex.

316
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,916
You'll get them next time, pal. Yeah.

317
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,958
And look, you can always

318
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,291
go back to super-heroing.

319
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,458
I mean, I know I'd like to

320
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,458
see you back in the suit.

321
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:16,958
I don't keep it in my

322
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,500
locker so that I can wear it.

323
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,165
I keep it in my locker in

324
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,707
case we need to settle up again.

325
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,207
Hey, hey, hey. What

326
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,375
is that doing in there?

327
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,208
I'm done.

328
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm done.

329
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,208
Man, I'm fine with being done.

330
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,125
Look, is sales the best match?

331
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:33,916
Probably none.

332
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,000
Is this the life that I

333
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:36,291
always imagined for myself?

334
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,541
Fuck no!

335
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,910
This is the right fit for me.

336
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,500
Sugar Bear, it is. Okay, Mr. Wilson.

337
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,374
I'm just saying, once a month, we could

338
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,416
go on a little mission.

339
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,125
We're human beings. We crave purpose.

340
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,333
After all, we're Deadpool.

341
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,541
Please stop saying

342
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,249
that. We're not Deadpool.

343
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,583
I'm not even Deadpool anymore.

344
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,790
Well, if we're gonna have

345
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,333
a midlife crisis, go big.

346
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,207
A few years ago, a friend of

347
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,458
mine got his nipples pierced

348
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,124
with a titanium chain that goes down and

349
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,583
attaches to his Van Johnson.

350
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,374
Are you feeling Grumple

351
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,855
stiltskin because it's your birthday?

352
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,041
What?

353
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,958
No.

354
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,791
No.

355
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,250
Surprise!

356
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,582
All right, you guys

357
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,000
are lucky I'm not armed.

358
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,541
Get in here.

359
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,666
This was six years

360
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,666
ago. You'd all be dead.

361
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,124
So then, he gets out of the cab, and you

362
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,041
would not believe it.

363
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,166
I turn around, and what do I find?

364
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,250
Airpods. Airpods!

365
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,333
Crazy stories. Every time.

366
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,208
Come on. Fingle time.

367
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,791
Make any sales today?

368
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,250
You know I didn't.

369
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,375
Did you sell any

370
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:50,976
dreamcatchers on Etsy or whatever it is?

371
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,915
I went to do it three days away, and I

372
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,500
can't keep carrying it. Relax.

373
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,582
I have the money. I sold some old blood

374
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,250
pressure medication I found lying around.

375
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,249
You're trying to kill me, motherfucker.

376
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,166
I'm not the one dousing

377
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,540
everything in salt, motherfucker.

378
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,957
I pray every day that fire finds your

379
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,915
body and finishes the job

380
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,082
God didn't have the nuts to do.

381
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,457
That's hurtful. If you could hear the

382
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,125
look on my face,

383
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:15,625
you'd smell how sad I am.

384
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,833
You watching me good?

385
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,458
Great British break-off.

386
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,833
Oh, God damn.

387
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,333
This shit stood between me

388
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,500
and suicide for ten years.

389
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,750
Those are my feelings.

390
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,582
Abortion, religious freedom, animal

391
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,707
rights, privacy rights, vaccines, free

392
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,375
market capitalism, global climate change.

393
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,686
No, no, no, no, sweet from let's fuck.

394
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,375
Hi, you, Kyo. Hi, Wade.

395
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,208
Nice, fake o'clock shadow.

396
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,583
It's a summer balayage from the French.

397
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,040
It's meant to mimic the natural

398
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,750
highlights of the sun.

399
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,476
It's a toupee. It's a hair system.

400
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,083
I love your hair system, Wade.

401
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,375
Thank you.

402
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,415
Want to do some cocaine? Hey, cocaine is

403
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,083
the one thing that

404
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:54,458
Faggy said is off-limits.

405
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,749
What about Bolivian watching? They know

406
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,500
all the slang terms. They have a list.

407
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,416
Even snowboarding? Even disco dust.

408
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,125
White girl interrupted? Even force bump.

409
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,000
Focus shift. I wouldn't

410
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,333
even try powdered go nuts.

411
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,000
Do you want to build a

412
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,458
snowman? Yes, but I can't.

413
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,166
Hold here. Here?

414
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,458
What happened? That's the buzz part.

415
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,708
Thanks for coming. Yeah.

416
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,583
How's work? Oh, I got a promotion.

417
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,375
No way. Yeah.

418
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,040
It's mind-numbing middle

419
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,166
management, but I'm happy.

420
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,458
That's great.

421
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,820
You want to see him? How are you?

422
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,666
Um, yeah. Guy from work.

423
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,875
Derman. Derman?

424
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,916
He's kind. Good.

425
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,333
Likes to go hiking.

426
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,250
Hasn't gotten me shot yet.

427
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,375
Wow. It's the early days.

428
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,291
How about you? You seeing anyone?

429
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,624
No, no, I live in a one-bedroom

430
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,500
apartment. Share bed with blind Al.

431
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,500
All right. All right.

432
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,291
Happy birthday to you.

433
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,500
Okay, okay, okay.

434
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Birthdays.

435
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,915
Every spin around the moon

436
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,000
is a new adventure indeed.

437
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,041
Sundomous. Okay, round-earther.

438
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,875
Where was I? The Adventure of Life.

439
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,625
Right. It's been a challenging few years.

440
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,957
I haven't seen you guys in a while. And

441
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,833
through a lot. Change of life.

442
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,020
Nail-a-paw? Bitch, are you improv-ing?

443
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:31,458
I'm sorry that you had

444
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,458
to see that, Yuki-oh.

445
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,333
But I'm happy.

446
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,082
You know, that's because of

447
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,000
each and every one of you.

448
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,999
I guess what I'm trying to say is how

449
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,874
proud I am, how grateful I am,

450
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,832
to be standing in a room with every

451
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,666
single person I love.

452
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,916
I'm the luckiest man alive.

453
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,458
Make a wish, buddy. 10-4, good buddy.

454
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,166
Going down.

455
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,208
Lee Wilson? Oh, yeah. Dancers.

456
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,499
The painter must have ordered you. Are

457
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,860
those supposed to be cop costumes?

458
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,999
Never mind. Take your

459
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,874
clothes off, but leave the helmets.

460
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:20,500
And this isn't Pretty

461
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:23,208
Woman. We're kissing, all right?

462
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,016
What song do you guys normally dance to?

463
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,665
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

464
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,666
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

465
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,660
Is that supposed to be scary?

466
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,083
Hagging isn't new for me,

467
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,708
friendo, but it is for Disney.

468
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,666
Look, I've never been a natural bottom.

469
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,750
So we're going to take things real slow,

470
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,916
and I want some crazy eye contact.

471
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,250
Not you, you.

472
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,458
I can't see your eyes through

473
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:45,624
the mask, but I can feel it.

474
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,957
We're going to move on down the hallway

475
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,249
so we can spare a cleanup on Isle Hassel.

476
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,790
How does everyone feel about this planet?

477
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,082
I don't like you. Yes.

478
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,290
Let's hold on to that attitude,

479
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,000
and we're going to do it angry.

480
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,750
Mr. Wilson.

481
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,999
You appear to have soiled

482
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,333
yourself while unconscious.

483
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,541
I was unconscious. Who are you?

484
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,458
I go by the name of Paradox, Mr. Paradox,

485
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,999
and you're sitting here at the TVA, the

486
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,333
Time Variance Authority.

487
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,208
We're really a watchdog organization.

488
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,291
Except we're more

489
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,040
lighthearted than that sounds,

490
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,000
with sort of throwback ironic twist.

491
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,415
And we're in charge of defending what's

492
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,750
known as the sacred timeline.

493
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,040
Holy fuck, that is a shit ton of

494
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,290
exposition for a three-quel.

495
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,665
Is this because I used Cable's Time

496
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,749
Machine, brought a

497
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,874
couple of people back to life,

498
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,165
then I destroyed it.

499
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,166
That was a long time ago.

500
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,250
Yes, we're aware of your

501
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,458
abuse of your timeline.

502
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,708
You were so abusive of it.

503
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,374
No, it has nothing to do

504
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,000
with that. Walk with me.

505
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,290
I brought you here, Mr. Wilson, to tell

506
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,375
you that you're special.

507
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,166
In fact, you've been

508
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,457
chosen for a higher purpose,

509
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,375
a purpose unclear even to me,

510
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,040
but one that could save

511
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,458
the entire sacred timeline

512
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,124
from a possibly grisly

513
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,291
fate sometime in the future,

514
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:29,750
which may very well need to be avenged.

515
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,415
This sacred timeline, I assume I'm going

516
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:38,000
to marvel at how cinematic it feels,

517
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,707
gratuitous cameons, indiscriminate use of

518
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,828
variance, the whole package.

519
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,583
No, you tell me.

520
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Gav.

521
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,000
You are no longer lost.

522
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:02,333
Wait.

523
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,458
You can be a hero among the heroes.

524
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,333
We've been surveilling

525
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:07,500
you for quite a while.

526
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,583
It's a boy station.

527
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,250
The TVA outpost, yes.

528
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,583
And what is that?

529
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,375
Is that me? Is that Thor?

530
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:19,458
Is he crying?

531
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,708
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

532
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,832
That happens in the distant future.

533
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,541
Why is Thor crying?

534
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,540
Do not speak to her. Stop that.

535
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,957
I brought you here to

536
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:28,958
offer you an opportunity,

537
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,457
the opportunity you sought years ago but

538
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,618
for which you were not ready.

539
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,333
We believe you're ready now,

540
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,374
ready for a chance to leave your timeline

541
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,249
and join the greatest universe of all.

542
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,000
I am about to give you the

543
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,040
thing you've always wanted.

544
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,499
I smell what you're stepping in.

545
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,458
The power of the Marvel

546
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,083
universe is about to change forever.

547
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,500
I am an aside.

548
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,625
I am...

549
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,791
Marvel Jesus.

550
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Excuse me.

551
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,000
She's getting over here.

552
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Suck it, Fox.

553
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:05,916
I'm on Disneyland.

554
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Get fucked!

555
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:11,875
Where do I sign?

556
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,540
Oh, it's an ending for paper work.

557
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,625
Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.

558
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,791
There is one thing I will need, though.

559
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,833
Oh, fuck off.

560
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,875
Adorn me, Beardo.

561
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,333
Fuck it!

562
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
It's perfect.

563
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,165
FYI, your tailor is a

564
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,500
predator, but I love it.

565
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,457
Snug, no camel toe, new

566
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,416
car smell, and adamantium.

567
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,000
Katomas, you shouldn't have.

568
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,375
Go ahead. Take it in.

569
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And yes, your

570
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,166
underwear is getting tighter.

571
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,186
That guy knows what I'm talking about.

572
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,332
His clothes say middle management, but

573
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,375
his eyes say fucky fucky.

574
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,208
Yes, you look very nice.

575
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,707
Nice? Your buddy here is ready to throw

576
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,832
it all away from me.

577
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,833
You calling your wife?

578
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,083
HR.

579
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,166
Is your wife working HR?

580
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,125
I'm really glad

581
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:22,416
you're taking this so well.

582
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,458
Oh, I'm taking it well.

583
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,207
I have never had a

584
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,332
problem traveling for work.

585
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,083
That said, we should talk vacation dance.

586
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,791
I'm more of a one-week-on,

587
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,040
one-week-off kind of guy.

588
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,521
I think it's what they do in Denmark.

589
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,666
You'll never see a Danish

590
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,666
flag in the moon, but...

591
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,288
God damn it, they're happy.

592
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,707
Now, let's power up your

593
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,332
little Amazon Fire Phone there

594
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,749
and sit me back home so

595
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,458
I can let my friends know

596
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,416
that they've been upgraded to Disciples.

597
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,500
Yep. I hear that you quite understand.

598
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,415
You will not be returning to your home

599
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,208
because there will be

600
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:52,833
no home to return to.

601
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,916
Come again, this time in my ears?

602
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,125
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.

603
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,999
That is what happens when a universe

604
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,083
loses their anchor being.

605
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,416
See how it decays from the inside?

606
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,790
This is how a reality dies.

607
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,500
What's an anchor being?

608
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,500
An anchor being is an

609
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:15,915
entity of such vital importance

610
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,082
that when they die, their whole world

611
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,041
slowly withers out of existence.

612
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,500
You've just won the

613
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,041
lottery because I didn't die.

614
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,083
It's just a little

615
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,500
midlife crisis, I'm better now.

616
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,916
Oh, my God!

617
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,540
Oh, not to laugh.

618
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,915
Can you imagine if you

619
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,082
were the anchor being?

620
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,083
Yeah.

621
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,458
No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.

622
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,999
Your anchor being died in

623
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,416
an act of self-sacrifice

624
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,707
so epic that it sent

625
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,125
shivers down the timeline.

626
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,249
I am referring, of

627
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:57,125
course, to Logan, the Wolverine.

628
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,875
Don't be on that page.

629
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,708
Oh, this is what it feels like.

630
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,125
Logan.

631
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,208
Of course.

632
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,833
Logan.

633
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,583
Logan!

634
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,500
The guy forks for hands!

635
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,208
That Wolverine!

636
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:32,500
Yeah, I got it.

637
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:33,707
You can turn your retro

638
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,165
graphics of death off now.

639
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:35,458
Make it stop.

640
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,290
We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson. We

641
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,583
certainly can't stop it.

642
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,625
How long have we got?

643
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,875
In most cases, a couple thousand years.

644
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:44,958
Well, sweet.

645
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:45,625
Most cases aren't

646
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,166
fast enough, not for me.

647
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:48,875
What does that mean?

648
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,624
It means that I have been tasked with

649
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,749
overseeing the end of your universe

650
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,165
and regardless of what the pencil pushers

651
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,166
upstairs would prefer,

652
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:59,999
I will not waste my life watching it die

653
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,208
slowly of natural causes.

654
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,291
We used to just prune these things,

655
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,458
simple, elegant, efficient,

656
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,957
but I'm told the TVA

657
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,250
doesn't like to do that anymore.

658
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,041
Well, I do.

659
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,833
And no matter what my

660
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:09,957
so-called superiors say,

661
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:10,791
the multiverse does

662
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,624
not need a babysitter.

663
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,291
We need a mercy killer.

664
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,583
And in this instance,

665
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,333
I am the mercy killer.

666
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:25,707
What in the macguffin is that?

667
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,666
That's a time-reper for Mr. Wilson.

668
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,208
An accelerant.

669
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,707
Once completed, it will allow me to

670
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,999
destroy the space-time

671
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
matrix of your universe.

672
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,333
You see, I don't want

673
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,749
to work for the TVA.

674
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,875
I want to be the TVA.

675
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,957
And the first step involves showing this

676
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:41,999
organization how much more

677
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,999
efficient it can become to it.

678
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,665
I will be giving your universe a swift

679
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:47,625
and compassionate end.

680
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:48,583
And don't worry, your

681
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:49,541
friends won't feel a thing.

682
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:50,582
It'll be over just like this.

683
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,583
Oh, what's that?

684
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,750
Trust me.

685
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:07,166
You're gonna all be

686
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,333
other in my fucking universe.

687
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,666
In your parlance, yes.

688
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,610
Two in the heart, one in the head.

689
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,310
Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.

690
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,207
You can either rejoin your loved ones and

691
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,041
collectively cease to

692
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,540
exist in, let's say, 72 hours,

693
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:23,500
or you join the sacred timeline.

694
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,082
And you end your days of

695
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,333
insignificance and mediocrity.

696
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,541
Wade.

697
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:33,500
Wade, you can finally, finally matter.

698
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:45,791
That's all I've ever really wanted.

699
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,250
I know.

700
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,041
I know.

701
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,374
And you know, I'm nothing

702
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,041
if not morally flexible.

703
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,250
Hmm?

704
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,041
Yep, yep.

705
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:00,541
I'll do it.

706
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,125
Wade's choice.

707
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,458
Sacred timeline's happy to have you.

708
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,915
I was talking about finding the wolverine

709
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,500
and breaking your fucking nose.

710
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,416
Look at that.

711
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,541
Find him.

712
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:22,125
Find him!

713
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,333
And boy, did he ever turn.

714
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,291
Which brings us back to this.

715
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,230
The desecration of the sacred corpse.

716
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:40,875
Ow, my own fucking arm.

717
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:47,625
Now we're talking to my kids.

718
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,540
I'm sorry, wolverine is hard.

719
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,541
I can't stop.

720
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:54,791
Mangle tried.

721
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,250
You sick fuck.

722
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,999
Wolverine was a hero and the only thing

723
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
on earth is shit to

724
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,541
ever come out of Canada.

725
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,999
Get my country's name

726
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
out of your fucking mouth.

727
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,416
And my sword.

728
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:19,583
Look at that.

729
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,541
Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.

730
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,458
An alive one.

731
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,791
Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself back.

732
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Logan!

733
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,375
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

734
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,458
Who's asking?

735
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:47,541
Well, look at this

736
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,833
little hairy Lou Retton.

737
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,875
Did you stick the landing hook, I?

738
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,458
Yes, you did, comic-accurate short king.

739
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,708
Such a cute widow, wovee.

740
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,791
Cue the fucking montage, baby.

741
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,874
All right, everything

742
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,083
seems to be on fire.

743
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,541
You have a dragon?

744
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,374
Ooh, you have anchor

745
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,458
being written all over.

746
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:17,791
Patch.

747
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,458
Now we're talking.

748
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Ooh, yeah.

749
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:23,958
That's the whole

750
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,833
goddamn package right there.

751
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,875
I'm auditioning anchor beams.

752
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,916
Oh, that's gonna need some coconut oil.

753
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,000
Fuck, dude, the fuck.

754
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,541
Are you okay?

755
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,458
Oh, yes, yes.

756
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,874
Classic John Byrne round of ten now.

757
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:45,708
You found the Hulk in

758
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,708
this outfit, you know?

759
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,540
I marveled Jesus, you dull

760
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,581
creature, and I want to...

761
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,499
Not you. We're just going

762
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
in a different direction.

763
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,874
You know, from behind, you

764
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,040
look a little bit like Henry...

765
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,041
Oh, my fuck.

766
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,458
The cavalry. The legends are true.

767
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,457
And may I say, sir, on

768
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,583
behalf of all humanity,

769
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,375
this just feels right.

770
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:21,457
We will treat you so much better than

771
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,040
those shit-fucks down the street

772
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,041
you were just leaving.

773
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,374
No, sir, not while the

774
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,583
fate of my universe has had...

775
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,416
This one looks promising.

776
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,125
Down you go.

777
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,166
Again.

778
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,250
I told you, you're not welcome here.

779
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,786
You're not welcome anywhere.

780
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,458
Now get the fuck out of my bar.

781
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,582
Just give me one more

782
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:44,623
drink and then I'll leave.

783
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,333
That's not how it works.

784
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,000
It does now. Leave the bottle.

785
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,291
I know you, bub.

786
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,208
Nope. But I know you.

787
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,083
Everybody knows me.

788
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:56,958
I'm the Wolverine.

789
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:00,624
Yes, you are, and I'm gonna need you to

790
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,750
come with me right now.

791
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,415
Look, lady, I'm not interested.

792
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,416
Really getting into your cuffs...

793
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:06,875
Why would I go with you?

794
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,250
Because, unfortunately, I need you.

795
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,000
And even more

796
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:15,250
unfortunately, my entire world needs you.

797
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,375
You two gonna fuck or fight?

798
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:22,993
You gonna take that from him?

799
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:23,791
You.

800
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,957
I can tell you that sort

801
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:26,999
of don't get too close,

802
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,640
I'll only break your heart by going here.

803
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,082
But every other Wolverine would have

804
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,332
really hurt me by now.

805
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,999
And I'm sort of on the tic-tac, so,

806
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
upsy-dacy, here we go.

807
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
There you go, guys.

808
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,625
Oh.

809
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,161
Whiskey dick with the claws.

810
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,040
It's quite common in Wolverines over 40.

811
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:43,583
You don't want this.

812
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:44,833
You're right. I doubt it.

813
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,208
And you don't want this.

814
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,832
Unless you want to take a deep breath

815
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,033
through your fucking forehead,

816
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,583
I suggest you reconsider.

817
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Let's go, Peanut.

818
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,958
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

819
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,625
Watch this.

820
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,625
All right.

821
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,708
That's a little... easy.

822
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:09,958
Good God.

823
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,391
Thirsty little honey badger, aren't you?

824
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
It's okay. Keep going.

825
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:15,666
Audiences are

826
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,000
accustomed to long run times.

827
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:23,958
I guess you'll have to do...

828
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,875
Okay.

829
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:27,708
Ooh.

830
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,291
Look at those jammies.

831
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,666
That only took 20 fucking years.

832
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,458
One anchobain coming right up.

833
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,291
On your luck, baby girl.

834
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,499
This Logan has the same... he can do

835
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,040
anything even musicals.

836
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,832
But, notice, he's

837
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:43,666
actually wearing a costume

838
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:44,874
like he's not embarrassed to be on a

839
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:45,875
superhero movie for once.

840
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,375
I don't understand.

841
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,866
You said my universe is dying,

842
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,208
because this sack of

843
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:51,541
nuts got himself killed.

844
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,083
Well, problem solved.

845
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,166
My God.

846
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,249
You actually think you can replace an

847
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,291
anchobain with this?

848
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:02,249
I wouldn't have accepted any other

849
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,250
Wolverine beat-y-dubs,

850
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,707
but you have outdone yourself and brought

851
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,250
me the worst Wolverine.

852
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,823
What do you mean the worst one?

853
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,249
Mr. Huston, this Wolverine

854
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,416
let down his entire world.

855
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,000
He's the stuff of

856
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:16,208
legend, but not in a good way.

857
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:20,124
And what he did... well, some things are

858
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,125
just beyond forgiveness.

859
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,082
Okay. How do I make this

860
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,625
right? I can be all do anything.

861
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:31,083
I gave you a chance at greatness,

862
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,166
because my superior

863
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:33,874
has deemed you special.

864
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,207
Clearly not special in a good way,

865
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,999
but apparently you have some important

866
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,624
future purpose to serve.

867
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,666
With Thor, he holds me.

868
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,500
But I did my duty.

869
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:42,500
I gave you the

870
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:43,708
opportunity to be somebody,

871
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,957
and instead of accepting my offering with

872
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,000
humanity and gratitude,

873
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,416
you broke my nose.

874
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,250
It looks great.

875
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,499
I decimated dozens of my men with the

876
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,833
assumed corpse of a hero,

877
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:53,916
with sovereign not only

878
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:55,332
his remains, but his memory.

879
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,453
What do you think, Internet?

880
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,416
Your world is dying!

881
00:33:58,875 --> 00:33:59,875
Thank you very much.

882
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,208
And there's no stopping it.

883
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,457
The humanity of you is to make it quick.

884
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:07,749
Is the thought of vaporizing

885
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,291
my universe making you peckish?

886
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:10,500
I'm eating my feelings.

887
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,333
I'm about to lose everything

888
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:12,540
that I've ever cared about,

889
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,874
because that hairy thunder cunt from down

890
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,749
under cunt finally dies,

891
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,375
and he's standing

892
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:18,666
right behind me, isn't he?

893
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,573
Welcome to the MCU, by the way.

894
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,810
You're joining at a bit of a low point.

895
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,375
As for you, I want to talk to your boss.

896
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:26,458
I want you to get him on the phone,

897
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,165
and you tell him, her, or them that

898
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,083
Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

899
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:37,666
Holy shit.

900
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,874
I just heard a symphony of butt holes

901
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,916
clenching all at once.

902
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,291
You're off-grid.

903
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,582
Your bosses don't know what you sick

904
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,874
fucks are doing down here.

905
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,875
Well, I'll tell you what.

906
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,415
I have a black belt in Karen, and I'm

907
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,000
going to go upstairs,

908
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:50,916
and I'm going to tell

909
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,000
them all about you and...

910
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,458
Oh, silence is nice.

911
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,499
What the fuck did he kill?

912
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,125
To the trash heap.

913
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
You'll fit right in.

914
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,458
That was close.

915
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:25,500
That was close. Don't
just stand there, you ape.

916
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,958
Give me a hand of her.

917
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,500
No, emergency okay. Thank you.

918
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,624
Where the hell are we?

919
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,625
I don't know.

920
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,290
It looks kind of Mad Maxie.

921
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,125
But that would be IP infringement, right?

922
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Fucking jokes.

923
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,833
Are you even listening back there?

924
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,000
We don't make it back to

925
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:49,500
that Mr. Paradox asshole.

926
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,332
Everyone I know is going to die.

927
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,333
No, my fucking problem.

928
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,165
Well, is that all you got?

929
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,041
Is that what you said

930
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,291
when your world went to shit?

931
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:00,458
Come again?

932
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,250
Yeah, I heard all about you.

933
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,375
I screwed up everything,

934
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,249
and you should be thanking me for pulling

935
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,541
you out of that bed you shit in.

936
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,958
Are you backstabbing son of a bitch?

937
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,500
Are you ready to be calm now?

938
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,833
Rest in peace, this fox.

939
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:38,500
I don't want to fight you, peanut.

940
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,750
Doesn't matter what you did.

941
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,291
I just need your help.

942
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,583
I don't fucking care.

943
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:01,791
This is gonna hurt.

944
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Alright!

945
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,458
Fuck it!

946
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,140
Let's give the people what they came for.

947
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:13,291
Let's fucking go.

948
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,625
Get your special sock out, nerds.

949
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,250
This gonna get good.

950
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,208
Let's see you grow

951
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:27,416
your fucking head back!

952
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,582
I can fix it! I can fix it!

953
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,250
It's what? Whatever it is that you did.

954
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,458
Whatever made you so bad.

955
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,375
Those... those...

956
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,083
Freaks! In the TPA you heard them.

957
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,624
They have the power to end my universe.

958
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,915
But they also have the

959
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:43,375
power to change yours.

960
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
We get back there.

961
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,875
And we can fix your world.

962
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:49,625
Together.

963
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,125
I promise.

964
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,666
They can fix it.

965
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:55,458
Hey!

966
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,833
Hey! We fight each other, we lose.

967
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:00,583
Dear God, it's him.

968
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,583
Who? The one.

969
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,250
The superhero equivalent

970
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:05,500
to comfort food for Molly.

971
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,999
White guy's answer to all the

972
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,750
disappointments and another A-lister.

973
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,291
Fair warning, gorgeous.

974
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:12,000
You're going to

975
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:13,583
encounter some angelic language.

976
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,332
A smidge of ass play, but we've been

977
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,833
prohibited from using cocaine on camera.

978
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:18,666
They're coming.

979
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,041
Who's they?

980
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:28,250
Oh, they're driving angry.

981
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:36,333
Now that's a superhero lid!

982
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,458
I got this.

983
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,875
Stay close.

984
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:10,833
I got a camera.

985
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,208
You got this.

986
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,915
Cassandra is going to be kitty when she

987
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,916
sees what we caught.

988
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,041
You can't run. Everybody knows that.

989
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,458
You see anyone running, Dick Fabrains?

990
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:26,375
You're not going to

991
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:27,500
love what happens next.

992
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:28,708
Oh, oh my God.

993
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,875
Oink! Oh my God, he's going to save us.

994
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,665
Ha! Oh my God, he's going to save us!

995
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,666
Hey, what?

996
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:36,916
Avengers, available!

997
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,333
Oh!

998
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,458
We don't know that guy.

999
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:08,791
We thought we did.

1000
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,083
I know you.

1001
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:12,583
Holy sh...

1002
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:19,000
Sabretooth, your brother, ready to die!

1003
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,708
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Time!

1004
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You look ridiculous.

1005
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:25,541
People have waited

1006
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:27,083
decades for this fight.

1007
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,582
It's not going to be easy.

1008
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,041
Maybe not.

1009
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,750
Shoot the devil, take him down.

1010
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,083
Side control, then bowl him out,

1011
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,165
and be a ground and pound until he makes

1012
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,374
no sound because he's dead.

1013
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,125
Shut the fuck up.

1014
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,375
Oh my God.

1015
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,916
Okay, good luck. I'm a huge fan.

1016
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:53,916
What is it, girl?

1017
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:55,576
Is there trouble at the well?

1018
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:02,541
Big trouble.

1019
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,125
Behold!

1020
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:08,625
The head of your precious queen, Furiosa!

1021
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,833
I have the Wolverine.

1022
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:14,125
I alone control her.

1023
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:16,041
You come for me!

1024
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:19,166
You come for her.

1025
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:23,415
So sorry. I know it's pronounced him.

1026
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,291
I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.

1027
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:26,458
Who's next?

1028
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:27,083
Tog!

1029
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,541
You're up.

1030
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,458
Uh-oh.

1031
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Tog beep.

1032
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:46,833
Uh.

1033
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:49,708
I should've...

1034
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,791
I'm God of Thunder.

1035
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:56,416
When was I asleep?

1036
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,000
Not all of you was asleep.

1037
00:42:58,875 --> 00:42:59,875
Don't bother.

1038
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,375
We're very thorough.

1039
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,980
You know where we are, start talking.

1040
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,166
You're in the void.

1041
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:07,916
Think of it as purgatory.

1042
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:11,083
Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard

1043
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,790
where anything useless goes

1044
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,000
before it gets annihilated

1045
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,124
forever and where the TVA sends people

1046
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,041
that don't play nice

1047
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:19,333
with the rest of the multiverse.

1048
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:19,958
Like you?

1049
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:20,666
And you.

1050
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,330
What does the annihilating?

1051
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:23,708
A liet.

1052
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,416
A liet is in this thing?

1053
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:27,458
From Loki season one episode five?

1054
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:29,416
Everyone here is on the run from a liet.

1055
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,416
Oh, don't make it.

1056
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,161
There's a resistance though.

1057
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:35,207
Other people like us

1058
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,375
that manage to survive,

1059
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,642
they're hiding out in the border lanes

1060
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:40,583
trying to find a way to fuck outta here.

1061
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,250
Then that's where we go.

1062
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:43,083
Reed?

1063
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:43,583
Us?

1064
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:44,458
A teen?

1065
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:45,833
The answer is yes.

1066
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:46,458
Shake off.

1067
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,375
Fuck!

1068
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,458
You nipped it.

1069
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,333
Just got the tip with

1070
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:50,333
your little steak knife.

1071
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:51,500
These others can help

1072
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:52,832
us get back to the TVA.

1073
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:53,833
They can fix things.

1074
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:56,916
Something funny, Bob?

1075
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:57,833
She might have

1076
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,000
something to say about that.

1077
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:00,583
Who's she?

1078
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,750
In the void.

1079
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,040
You're either food for a

1080
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,333
liet or you work for her.

1081
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,458
Oh, all right, finely-aged.

1082
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,666
Oh, you must finish your jug or not.

1083
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:25,000
Thank you.

1084
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,166
I give your voices down.

1085
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,580
She don't like the chatter.

1086
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:30,833
She's gonna love you.

1087
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,083
Is it the child?

1088
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,750
Hey, hey, Jack, it's us!

1089
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,041
That's not the child.

1090
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,458
Ah, shit.

1091
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,250
Oh, Abel is some great.

1092
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:55,583
That's not gonna go over

1093
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:56,666
well with the wolf mob.

1094
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,208
A wolverine.

1095
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,166
I wondered when I'd get one of you.

1096
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,500
You're one of Xavier's.

1097
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:04,708
You know him, you know Chuck?

1098
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,125
Oh, I knew him.

1099
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
We shared a wound.

1100
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,124
Tried to strangle the sly little fellow

1101
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,458
with my umbilical cord.

1102
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,291
Amen.

1103
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:13,666
I've never loved roommates.

1104
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,874
Mine's blind, except she could see

1105
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:18,457
cocaine for some reason.

1106
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,778
You wanna chime in, Your Majesty?

1107
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,375
I'm dying here.

1108
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:22,416
Who are you?

1109
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:25,208
Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.

1110
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,030
Oh, shit. How did it anal birth?

1111
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:28,750
You two are cute.

1112
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,291
I have a good feeling about this.

1113
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,250
And I've been trying to

1114
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,665
catch this little firefly

1115
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:39,166
for years, haven't I, Johnny?

1116
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:42,041
You picked the wrong

1117
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,083
time to make new friends.

1118
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:45,916
Oh, Johnny told us all about you.

1119
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:46,708
Maybe shut up now.

1120
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:47,375
Yeah, maybe don't... We

1121
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:48,375
were just talking here.

1122
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,308
Yeah, Johnny told us you're a psychotic,

1123
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,999
megalomaniacal asshole.

1124
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,958
His word's not mine.

1125
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:54,875
Hell bent, a domination in pain.

1126
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:57,750
You said all that about me.

1127
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,000
No, no!

1128
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,540
How do you, I just say anything!

1129
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:01,666
Pick some stones, Johnny!

1130
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:04,750
I'll let her intimidate you.

1131
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,000
Like you said in the convoy.

1132
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,166
This finger-licking, dead inside,

1133
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,333
pixie slab of

1134
00:47:10,334 --> 00:47:12,166
third-rate dime store nut milk

1135
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,040
can eat your delicious cinnamon ring

1136
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,125
and kick rocks all the way to bald-end.

1137
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,290
I have never said any of those words

1138
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:19,415
in my entire life! I'm right!

1139
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,416
It's a modesty!

1140
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,083
People think I'm a shit-topper,

1141
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:24,875
but this guy, next level.

1142
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:25,125
What?

1143
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:27,582
This, I, wait, I don't even know what

1144
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:28,583
happened to that meat!

1145
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,541
My hat's off to you, sir, truly.

1146
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:34,916
I didn't, Keith, that's, I, I, I don't...

1147
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:41,124
Not my favorite, Chris.

1148
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,665
You stupid piece of shit, you

1149
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:43,786
just got him fucking killed!

1150
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,166
Hey, we're all grieving!

1151
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:46,790
PS, do you know what I'm

1152
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:47,791
gonna do to the budget?

1153
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,333
A lie at this hungry.

1154
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,401
There's been some kind of mistake.

1155
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,375
Big Yellow is a backup anchor being,

1156
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,708
and I'm Marvel Jesus, MJ and Turnasty.

1157
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,000
This may be hard to hear,

1158
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,458
but there's another British villain.

1159
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:02,750
He's gonna destroy my

1160
00:48:02,751 --> 00:48:04,250
universe, and I'm gonna stop him.

1161
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:05,707
Oh, honey, you don't really strike me

1162
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:06,791
as a world-saving type.

1163
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,750
Did I hit him off?

1164
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,278
I didn't want it to come to this.

1165
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,999
Either you help us, or my friend here

1166
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
is gonna sink the entire

1167
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:18,499
second act of music, man,

1168
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
with zero warm up.

1169
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,540
Where'd you get the chair?

1170
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:22,958
Once in a while, I did

1171
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:23,999
get a trowel through here.

1172
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,625
Nevermind, though, no.

1173
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,416
He didn't care to find me.

1174
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:32,708
Ah, jizzee, they're trauma-bragging!

1175
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,332
Can't you just stuff it

1176
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,749
down, turn it into accomplishment

1177
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,333
or cancer like the rest of us?

1178
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,582
But I'm not like the rest of you.

1179
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,750
Except maybe the Wolverine.

1180
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:42,749
Now we could be truly

1181
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:43,791
terrifying together.

1182
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,286
You know, that's scary, huh?

1183
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,041
The TVA certainly thought so.

1184
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,666
They sent me here before I could walk.

1185
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:51,874
And you know, it's the best thing that

1186
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:52,875
ever happened to me.

1187
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:54,541
I love it here.

1188
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:55,708
You live in a garbage dump.

1189
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,374
I think we both know who

1190
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,541
lives in the garbage dump.

1191
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:00,458
The void is a paradise.

1192
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:04,583
I can wield my power here without shame.

1193
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,125
Unfortunately, I had no child's Xavier

1194
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:08,500
to teach me temperance.

1195
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,333
What about your child?

1196
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,250
Did he protect you?

1197
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:14,875
Did he make you feel safe?

1198
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,041
We're immune, so we're never safe.

1199
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:26,749
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1200
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,750
I don't want the smoke.

1201
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,499
I don't have any beef with you.

1202
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,740
I just want to save my friends.

1203
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,458
I just, I want to go home.

1204
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:34,666
Well, the thing is, I could get you home.

1205
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:34,958
Good.

1206
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,250
But I don't want to.

1207
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:37,416
Not good.

1208
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:42,833
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

1209
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,665
Uh, your fingers are inside

1210
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,916
me, but not in a good way.

1211
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:48,332
My brother could enter

1212
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,666
one's mind with a fork.

1213
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,208
I have to get my hands dirty.

1214
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:54,208
Oh, gosh.

1215
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:56,625
I've got you.

1216
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:00,625
I've got you.

1217
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,333
I can't, I can't, you're not here.

1218
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:09,875
I'm right here.

1219
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:12,000
No, you're not, I can't.

1220
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:13,291
I'm right here.

1221
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:15,250
Then show me you gotta do something.

1222
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:17,916
Show you what?

1223
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,624
Show me you care about

1224
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,833
something bigger than you.

1225
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,207
Ever since they turned

1226
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,500
you down, you took a knee.

1227
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,125
Baby, you never got back up.

1228
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:32,228
I know you're going through something.

1229
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:34,125
Let me go through it with you.

1230
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:37,481
You're crazy, Max, you're not crazy.

1231
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,500
Where'd you go?

1232
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,250
Oh my God.

1233
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:48,875
You just say it, okay?

1234
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:51,499
Say, "I don't want you, I

1235
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,625
don't want to be with you."

1236
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,499
Go ahead, say it, say it, say it, say it.

1237
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,559
You don't want to be with me.

1238
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,863
Tell me that and I'll walk away.

1239
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,125
Say, "I don't want you."

1240
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:08,833
You'll never fucking matter.

1241
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:14,458
What?

1242
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,500
You'll never fucking matter.

1243
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,416
You'll never fucking matter.

1244
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:31,708
What?

1245
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:36,375
She never said that.

1246
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,041
No, but I bet she thought it.

1247
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
I wanna look.

1248
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:42,666
You are so mean.

1249
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,374
My brain could taste your fingers

1250
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:45,625
and they tasted like hate.

1251
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:47,582
And we're in God's name as

1252
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,750
the intimacy coordinator.

1253
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,041
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

1254
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,833
How long before you came here?

1255
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,165
Mrs. Baby Knife, she's

1256
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:58,458
gonna fuck you in the face now.

1257
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,666
If you want to kill me,

1258
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:00,208
it's going to take

1259
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:01,208
more than a little bit.

1260
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:02,791
How about sex?

1261
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,375
Ah, my boy, quick and strong.

1262
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,875
That's my big boy, yet you are.

1263
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,541
Well, this has been fun,

1264
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:18,875
but the big guy needs to

1265
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:19,916
eat and the rent is due.

1266
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,291
By the way, you're the rent.

1267
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:49,250
Coming or what?

1268
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,708
Coming!

1269
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:11,582
What you thinking, Val?

1270
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:12,749
Get the fuck off of me.

1271
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:13,166
Shh, shh.

1272
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:14,250
I was done.

1273
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,333
Who was done what?

1274
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,083
Getting my knife out of your buttocks.

1275
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Ah, fuck!

1276
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,666
Go, get your mind out of my pants.

1277
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:21,875
I'm telling Blake.

1278
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,125
New rules.

1279
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:24,583
I talk now.

1280
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:25,291
That's gonna be very

1281
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:25,916
hard on the audience.

1282
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,458
Shut the fuck up!

1283
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:29,583
Let me fucking think.

1284
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,625
We gotta get back to paradox, right?

1285
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Right?

1286
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:36,541
It's an excuse.

1287
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:37,665
Am I allowed to speak now or...

1288
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,208
Just nod, asshole.

1289
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:41,708
Right.

1290
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:43,250
Then we find the others.

1291
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:44,665
That poor kid Johnny was talking about

1292
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:45,708
before you got him killed.

1293
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,041
Oh, our kid, he's like 50.

1294
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:48,250
If there's a chance they

1295
00:53:48,251 --> 00:53:49,332
know how to get out of here,

1296
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,165
we find him and make those TVA fuckers

1297
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:53,208
fix my shit like you fucking promised.

1298
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:54,666
I smell Quest.

1299
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:58,583
I smell food.

1300
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:03,540
So what made you finally

1301
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,208
wear an Anastagat costume?

1302
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,708
Find bread so they can't see any bleed.

1303
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,540
But I can see how

1304
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:11,999
yellow would be useful too.

1305
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,240
Have you been checked for ADHD?

1306
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,750
Mm-mm.

1307
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,750
But I've had several STDs,

1308
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,041
which were probably caused by ADHD.

1309
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:22,541
What are you looking for?

1310
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,208
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

1311
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:26,666
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1312
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:27,666
That's probably alcohol.

1313
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,666
You don't wanna drink up?

1314
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:29,333
Yeah, there you go.

1315
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,666
Fuck that liver.

1316
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,250
Okay.

1317
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:35,875
What the fuck are those?

1318
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:36,791
Oh.

1319
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,499
Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,

1320
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
but nobody knows.

1321
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:45,000
Everybody knows.

1322
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,165
Wanna talk about what's haunting you

1323
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,374
or should we wait for

1324
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,375
a third act flashback?

1325
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,208
Go fuck yourself.

1326
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:57,916
You know,

1327
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,875
my world, you're well regarded.

1328
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:05,583
Yeah, well, not in mine.

1329
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,665
They don't like me much in mine either.

1330
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:09,666
You don't say.

1331
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,456
I want it to be something.

1332
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,499
You know, I've, shit, I

1333
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,500
want it to be an Avenger.

1334
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Fuck the Avengers.

1335
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:18,499
You know, I didn't make the cut though.

1336
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,500
Same with the X-Men.

1337
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:22,999
My girlfriend left me like this.

1338
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Did you let a girlfriend?

1339
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,500
Yeah.

1340
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:28,666
Vanessa, when we met, she was a dancer.

1341
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:33,000
I mean, her whole life was good.

1342
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,458
But oh boy, I just,

1343
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,791
fuck that right up.

1344
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,958
But you, you were an X-Men.

1345
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,000
Fuck that, you were the X-Men.

1346
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:46,291
The Wolverine.

1347
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:47,416
The Wolverine?

1348
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,123
He's a hero in that world.

1349
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:56,625
Yeah, well, he had shit in mind.

1350
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,291
You said Logan was a hero, what happened?

1351
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:06,666
He died.

1352
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:08,541
Oh.

1353
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,666
Well, technically you

1354
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,290
were chest fucked by a tree,

1355
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:13,041
but really he just ran out of batteries

1356
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:14,208
trying to save someone.

1357
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:14,833
Who?

1358
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,790
The shit heels that grew

1359
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,458
in a lab called her X-23.

1360
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,541
But she was just a kid.

1361
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,999
A younger, daintier,

1362
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,541
somehow meaner version of you.

1363
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,458
He died trying to save her.

1364
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:27,791
It was beautiful.

1365
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:30,625
Look, Miho, I know you're hurt.

1366
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:32,665
My blind, elderly

1367
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:33,958
African-American roommate,

1368
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,291
Blind Al, always says that

1369
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,791
pain teaches us who we are.

1370
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:38,766
Sometimes we need to listen to that pain

1371
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:39,916
instead of running from it.

1372
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:40,666
Holy shit.

1373
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:41,666
Yeah, she's wise.

1374
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,375
No, no, that's her

1375
00:56:42,376 --> 00:56:43,791
name, you call her Blind Al.

1376
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,375
Well, she's blind.

1377
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,374
I've never seen you look

1378
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,583
as lovely as you did tonight

1379
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:04,500
I've never seen you shine so bright

1380
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,791
Lady of red

1381
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,875
Just dancing with me

1382
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:19,625
She did you

1383
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:22,541
There's nobody here

1384
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:23,958
Look at you.

1385
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,250
She's coming with us.

1386
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:26,000
No, she's not.

1387
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,208
Oh, yes, she is.

1388
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:27,458
Oh, no.

1389
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:28,583
Oh, yes. Sorry.

1390
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:30,833
Sorry about that.

1391
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:32,541
Come here, girl.

1392
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:34,666
Who are you?

1393
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm Deadpool.

1394
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,780
And I guess you're Deadpool too.

1395
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,806
But in here, everybody calls me Vicepool.

1396
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,041
Oh my goodness, where

1397
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:41,916
do you see Ladypool?

1398
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:42,916
She is gorgeous.

1399
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:44,208
She just had a baby

1400
00:57:44,209 --> 00:57:46,208
too, and I can't even tell.

1401
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:47,041
I don't think you're

1402
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:47,958
supposed to say that.

1403
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That's okay.

1404
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,458
I identify as a feminist, right?

1405
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,875
Are those gold-plated, 50 caliber

1406
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:57,415
desert eagle pistoleros?

1407
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:58,416
Of course.

1408
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,708
To match my ear huggy.

1409
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:00,958
Can I have her?

1410
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,000
Over my dead body.

1411
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
You're fun.

1412
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:05,416
And I guess you've

1413
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:06,707
already met Mary Puffin.

1414
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,541
It's AKA Dogpool.

1415
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:09,666
Therefore, you put your

1416
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:11,415
hand, she's 90% G-Spy,

1417
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:12,541
and she'll let you know it.

1418
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:15,124
You let this little flirt out of your

1419
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,332
sight for one second

1420
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,416
and she starts shopping for a new papa.

1421
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:20,999
If you can't be a responsible pedo,

1422
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,583
then maybe you don't

1423
00:58:21,584 --> 00:58:22,750
deserve this little unicorn.

1424
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,250
Guilty on all charges, your honor.

1425
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
She can't happen again.

1426
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:28,125
Why are you so nice?

1427
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:29,833
It costs nothing to be kind.

1428
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,875
Shutting the fuck up is also free.

1429
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:32,458
Got it, isn't it?

1430
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,500
This is Logan.

1431
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:34,500
He's usually shirtless,

1432
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,416
but he's let himself go

1433
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:36,416
since the divorce.

1434
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,083
Where's her mask?

1435
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,125
Come on, guys.

1436
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,500
Oh, this guy.

1437
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:47,185
We're looking for a group of survivors.

1438
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:48,083
Oh, they're out there.

1439
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:48,583
Yeah.

1440
00:58:48,584 --> 00:58:49,957
But Merk to Merk, you better hope

1441
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:50,500
that you don't run

1442
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,500
into the Deadpool core.

1443
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:52,833
Yeah, they're crazy.

1444
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:53,666
They will chop you up

1445
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:54,583
into a thousand pieces

1446
00:58:54,584 --> 00:58:55,999
and hide you all over the void.

1447
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,500
If they could only

1448
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:57,999
process their childhood trauma,

1449
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,833
they'd go on one heck

1450
00:58:58,833 --> 00:58:59,666
of a healing journey.

1451
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:00,976
Look, we're headed for the Borderlands.

1452
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You know where it is?

1453
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,041
Borderlands, yeah, that's 12 clicks.

1454
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,541
Do West, I can lend you

1455
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,541
my ride if you like it.

1456
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:07,875
It would be my honor.

1457
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:12,666
Oh, no, no, no, no,

1458
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:13,916
no, no, absolutely not.

1459
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,458
Uh-uh, what the?

1460
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,375
No, no.

1461
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:17,375
Jettish get in the car.

1462
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:18,416
This isn't a car.

1463
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,708
This is a Honda fucking Odyssey.

1464
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:22,583
Throttle response sucks a cock.

1465
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:24,249
Dated infotainment system.

1466
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,999
When Honda saw that untreated chlamydia

1467
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,290
was making a comeback, they

1468
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,624
invented the Honda Odyssey

1469
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:29,833
to compete.

1470
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,750
Get in the fucking car.

1471
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:34,566
He'll get you there safe and sound.

1472
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:35,291
Oh, Betsy always does.

1473
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:37,915
You're gonna have to

1474
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,375
give him a dog back though.

1475
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,000
I know, listen.

1476
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,750
Yeah, it's child.

1477
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,124
If you ever wanna give her up,

1478
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:45,249
or if she needs a new home,

1479
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,999
or if something should happen to you,

1480
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,166
I'd love to be her papa.

1481
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:50,500
Oh, whatever happened to me.

1482
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Lots of stuff.

1483
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,333
No, we're running away.

1484
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,291
Don't, the corn was too dense, girl.

1485
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:02,708
Fuckers, no.

1486
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:08,416
Don't take me home

1487
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:13,583
It's the damn common ice

1488
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:16,083
It's right for your love

1489
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:18,041
This life

1490
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:21,250
I want to take me by hand

1491
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:23,416
Take me somewhere new

1492
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,291
I don't know who you are

1493
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:27,708
But I

1494
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:29,666
I'm with you

1495
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,208
Okay, I'm just gonna ask it.

1496
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:34,458
What's with the suit?

1497
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,332
First thing I did when I flamed out,

1498
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,041
I took my knife.

1499
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:37,541
Drop it.

1500
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:38,500
It's not that ugly.

1501
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,291
Stop talking about myself.

1502
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:40,375
Did you make it yourself?

1503
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:40,916
Been there.

1504
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:41,875
Quit now.

1505
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:42,958
The X-Men make you wear it?

1506
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,708
Those sons of fucking bitches.

1507
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:45,916
They are not your

1508
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:46,833
friends, I'll tell you that.

1509
01:00:46,834 --> 01:00:48,749
Friends don't let friends leave the house

1510
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,458
looking like they fight

1511
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:51,083
crime for the Los Angeles Rams.

1512
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:52,184
Shut the fuck up about this.

1513
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,041
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1514
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:54,707
Watch your frown lines, angel baby.

1515
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:55,666
I'm just trying to bond a little bit.

1516
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:56,291
Yeah, well then talk

1517
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,250
about something else.

1518
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,291
Fine.

1519
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,208
Stop.

1520
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:08,916
They can fix your world.

1521
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:09,791
What's the first thing you're gonna do

1522
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:10,708
when you get out of here?

1523
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,040
Some rubbing alcohol shots?

1524
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,708
Maybe a wiper fluid chaser?

1525
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:14,958
What did you say?

1526
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:15,916
So when you get back,

1527
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:16,750
what's the first thing you're gonna do?

1528
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:17,791
No, no, no, before that.

1529
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:21,000
Yep, they can fix your world?

1530
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:27,915
What do you mean if I mean...

1531
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:28,541
You lied to me.

1532
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,790
I have a fucking clue if

1533
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:30,750
they can help me fix things,

1534
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:31,041
do you?

1535
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,333
No, I mean...

1536
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:33,375
No, fuck!

1537
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:34,708
Fuck!

1538
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:35,958
I didn't lie.

1539
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,500
You lied.

1540
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,333
No, I made an educated wish.

1541
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:41,541
Because I need you.

1542
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,500
This, this is why.

1543
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,041
Right here.

1544
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,208
Because if we don't

1545
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:48,208
do something, they die.

1546
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:49,291
I don't know anything

1547
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:50,291
about saving worlds.

1548
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,041
Why would I even care?

1549
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,207
Because my entire world is

1550
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,333
right here in this picture.

1551
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:57,458
It's only nine people,

1552
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,916
and I have no idea how to save it alone.

1553
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,665
I know how to fuck people up for money,

1554
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:05,000
but you, you, know how to save them.

1555
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:07,573
What's the other Wolverine did?

1556
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh, fuck!

1557
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:11,083
I guess I'm stuck with the worst one.

1558
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,957
Did you say you made an

1559
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:16,875
educated fucking wish?

1560
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:19,083
They call me the Merc with the Mouth.

1561
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,665
They don't call me Truthful Timmy,

1562
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,458
the blowjob queen of Saskatoon.

1563
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:28,375
One more.

1564
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,291
Please give me one.

1565
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,583
Goober tutorial.

1566
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,605
You know what, you're a fucking joke.

1567
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,915
No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.

1568
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:44,791
Or the X-Men, they'll

1569
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:45,791
say fuck them anyone.

1570
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,165
I mean, you are a

1571
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:51,583
ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.

1572
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:54,207
I have never met a

1573
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,625
sadder, more attention-starved,

1574
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:59,499
jabbering little prick in my entire life.

1575
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,416
And that says a lot,

1576
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:01,416
because I've been alive

1577
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,791
for more than 200 fucking years.

1578
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,999
I'll tell ya, that ball

1579
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,290
chick was right about one thing.

1580
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,458
You will never save the world.

1581
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:12,333
You couldn't even save a relationship

1582
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,166
with a goddamn stripper.

1583
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:15,999
Motherfucker, I wish I

1584
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,041
could say you'd die alone,

1585
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,499
but it's one of God's best

1586
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,374
jokes that you can't die,

1587
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,625
except that's on all of us.

1588
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,250
You got nothing to say, mouth?

1589
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:38,500
I'm gonna fight you now.

1590
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,166
Oh, boy.

1591
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
How are you?

1592
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,416
Back off, now, hurry.

1593
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:02,333
I'm dirty, bitch!

1594
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,166
No, no, no.

1595
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,250
Nice.

1596
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,415
I take it all back, the

1597
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:03,166
Honda Odyssey fucks hard.

1598
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:05,166
Too bad you don't needle dick.

1599
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:07,000
Oh, we're just getting started, bubba.

1600
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,041
Thor!

1601
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:10,041
Where are we?

1602
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:13,458
No clue, but I like it here.

1603
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:15,125
Okay, look at you all.

1604
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:16,750
You must be the others.

1605
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,666
Terrific.

1606
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:22,250
So just to refresh, you are one...

1607
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,707
Elector. Elector, yes.

1608
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:24,708
Who could forget?

1609
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,957
And you, I was not

1610
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:28,166
expecting to see you here,

1611
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,791
but you were, you know, retired.

1612
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:33,583
Retired.

1613
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:35,833
Retired.

1614
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:36,833
I'm already in the void.

1615
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:38,309
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

1616
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:39,125
I don't like you.

1617
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,166
You never did.

1618
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,499
And who's this succulent

1619
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,125
reminder of my own inadequacies?

1620
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,791
Look at you.

1621
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:47,833
You look like the

1622
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:49,208
superhero version of Hawkeye.

1623
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,250
The name's Remy Labo.

1624
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,040
You dare have let me know,

1625
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:54,666
but you can call me the gamut.

1626
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:55,291
It's been a while

1627
01:07:55,292 --> 01:07:56,458
since I've seen Sling Blade

1628
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:57,666
hit me again.

1629
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,666
They call me the gamut.

1630
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,208
Do they?

1631
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,457
Are you sure you didn't just really,

1632
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:02,291
really want them to,

1633
01:08:02,292 --> 01:08:03,492
but it never quite worked out?

1634
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:05,458
So would they.

1635
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,000
You know, we never had

1636
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,166
a Wolverine up in here.

1637
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,665
But I can tell you now, it's just a

1638
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,041
common courtesy to ask

1639
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:14,021
before you drink up all of my liquor.

1640
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,100
That's a good thing I don't give a fuck.

1641
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
So embarrassing.

1642
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:27,875
Well, now that that's settled,

1643
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:28,708
look, we came a long

1644
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:29,708
way to find you three.

1645
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:30,791
There's four of us.

1646
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:31,250
There's four?

1647
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:32,666
Wait, is it Magneto?

1648
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,582
Dear sweet God in

1649
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:35,750
heaven, let it be Magneto,

1650
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:37,041
because with him, fuck!

1651
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:37,375
He's dead.

1652
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:38,790
Now Disney gets cheap?

1653
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:39,541
It's like Pinocchio

1654
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:40,707
jammed his face in my ass

1655
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,250
and started lying like crazy.

1656
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:46,500
Not a single word,

1657
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:47,833
what do you do exactly?

1658
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,666
Charge the playing cards.

1659
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:50,958
Make them go boom.

1660
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,000
Your powers close

1661
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:53,041
that magic, that's good.

1662
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,655
We're not totally fucked at all.

1663
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:56,250
So who brought us here?

1664
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:57,791
That would be me.

1665
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:09,416
Don't make me regret it.

1666
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,333
Holy shit, Logan,

1667
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,541
that's her, that's ex-23.

1668
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:15,818
She's the one they told you about.

1669
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,250
How did you all get stuck in the void?

1670
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:23,866
There was a knock at the door,

1671
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:25,500
TVA sent me here.

1672
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:25,958
Me too.

1673
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,499
Maybe I was born here, so

1674
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,580
it's hard to know for sure.

1675
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,041
TVA decided our universe was dying,

1676
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:33,125
and I never even got a

1677
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:34,125
chance to fight for it.

1678
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,583
People like us don't go quietly.

1679
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,916
TVA knows that, so they took us out.

1680
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:43,625
The answer is yes, I'm in.

1681
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,500
In what?

1682
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:45,875
A team.

1683
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,666
Me, you, you and me, all of us together.

1684
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,374
Let's get the fuck out of this place.

1685
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:51,374
Oh, listen, don't leave the fucking line.

1686
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:52,500
It was an educated wish!

1687
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,208
Ah, look.

1688
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,708
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

1689
01:09:58,208 --> 01:09:59,332
The only way out of

1690
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:00,625
the void is through her.

1691
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
She can get us home.

1692
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,000
She told us.

1693
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:04,361
Wait a minute, you've been inside?

1694
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:06,248
And you made it out alive?

1695
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:06,666
Bullshit.

1696
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:08,208
Nobody's ever done that.

1697
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:08,583
We did.

1698
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:09,583
Every time one of us

1699
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:10,583
is going up against her,

1700
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,416
they die.

1701
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,749
The Punisher, the

1702
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,250
Quicksilver, the Daredevil.

1703
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,958
Daredevil, I'm so sorry.

1704
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:17,541
It's fine.

1705
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Okay.

1706
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,833
Even that sweet baby angel, Johnny Stone,

1707
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:24,625
he up and going missing

1708
01:10:24,626 --> 01:10:26,500
like, what, two days ago?

1709
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:28,916
Ah, that's so sad.

1710
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:30,791
Wherever this Johnny-Keller

1711
01:10:30,792 --> 01:10:32,291
is, I'm sure he's thriving.

1712
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:34,874
Look, there's strength

1713
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,083
in numbers, all right?

1714
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:37,957
Us, plus you guys, we can

1715
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,082
put Cassandra over our knee

1716
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,683
and force her to let us out of the void.

1717
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,499
I know what it means to feel self-doubt.

1718
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,541
I don't feel that at all.

1719
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:44,166
I'm good.

1720
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,000
Now I get your gut like

1721
01:10:45,001 --> 01:10:46,082
a coke duct tape work.

1722
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:46,625
It's like you're in

1723
01:10:46,626 --> 01:10:47,708
the middle of my soul.

1724
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:48,708
You guys may not have been

1725
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:50,041
able to save your universes,

1726
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,041
but you can avenge them.

1727
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,400
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

1728
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,083
Wait, you knew Johnny?

1729
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,125
Oh yeah.

1730
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:00,625
Dig head here, talk to

1731
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:01,500
him, and we'll team up.

1732
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:02,624
When Johnny came down with

1733
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:03,999
a little case of the dead.

1734
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,374
No, no, no, no, we don't know that.

1735
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:06,416
It was just a flesh wound.

1736
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:07,665
He may have survived.

1737
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:08,999
If he survived that,

1738
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,416
he is praying for death.

1739
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:12,125
Thank you, Dr. Wolverine.

1740
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:12,750
Really?

1741
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:13,996
What you do to Johnny, huh?

1742
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:15,738
Talk to him, I'm gonna stop you.

1743
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:17,291
Okay, okay, hey, hey, hey.

1744
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:19,499
Okay, he rinsed badass

1745
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,541
mouth about Cassandra,

1746
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,875
and she zips-zapped his skin,

1747
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:23,958
leaving his organs to

1748
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:25,249
splash crudely under the ground

1749
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,957
while the soil greedily drank his blood.

1750
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:27,958
It was horrible.

1751
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,125
He was like a brother to me.

1752
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,624
Look, he died before he

1753
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:32,500
could make a difference,

1754
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,666
but maybe you couldn't save your world,

1755
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:37,916
but Jesus Christ, you could save mine.

1756
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,957
I don't give a shit about your world,

1757
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:41,749
but if these two made

1758
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,750
it out of their life,

1759
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:44,165
maybe together, we could

1760
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,750
get back in and take her down.

1761
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:46,791
Where'd it come from?

1762
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,666
We call that suicide, Sher.

1763
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,749
If we can block her psychic powers,

1764
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,708
we can get a leg up.

1765
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:52,250
I know it.

1766
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:53,916
Now, I know Magneto's dead,

1767
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:56,500
but I venture to guess that his helmet

1768
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,000
is lying around her stomach.

1769
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,416
Cassandra melted a helmet.

1770
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,625
How did she kill them?

1771
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:02,415
She don't believe.

1772
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:03,790
She knows that helmet was the only way

1773
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:05,208
to protect anyone from her powers.

1774
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:06,291
The only other helmet

1775
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:07,452
that's strong is Juggernauts,

1776
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:08,958
but he works for Cassandra.

1777
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,290
Juggernauts helmet, that's it.

1778
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:10,875
And we don't be knowing

1779
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:11,875
that it ain't coming off.

1780
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,582
I'm gonna come out with it.

1781
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:14,500
I'm so sorry, beautiful,

1782
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:15,541
how could this be gentle?

1783
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:16,791
Who is your dialect coach?

1784
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:17,708
The minions?

1785
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,207
I feel like we're missing

1786
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:20,958
critical exposition here.

1787
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:23,666
I'm sick of this shit.

1788
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:24,958
I'm sick of hiding.

1789
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:27,166
Let's face it, our

1790
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:28,208
world's forgot about us.

1791
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,457
Everyone never learned about us.

1792
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:31,541
The heroes we were.

1793
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:34,208
Lives we saved or wanted to save.

1794
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:36,333
Maybe these two are a chance,

1795
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,208
to be remembered the way we deserve.

1796
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:42,958
Yes.

1797
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:44,708
Legacy.

1798
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:47,583
Yes, yes, let this man cook.

1799
01:12:47,916 --> 01:12:49,156
This is what I'm talking about.

1800
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,249
Big slow motion, fight sad music,

1801
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,374
everybody working together.

1802
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:53,166
Who knows if you live or

1803
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,166
die, that sort of thing.

1804
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:54,875
Who's ready?

1805
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,166
I was born ready.

1806
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:57,583
Yes, damn it.

1807
01:12:57,625 --> 01:12:58,583
I ain't know my daddy,

1808
01:12:58,583 --> 01:12:59,458
but I'm sure I shot

1809
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,458
out of his dick ready.

1810
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,458
Jesus Christ, that is graphic.

1811
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:03,500
Yeah, he was random, but

1812
01:13:03,501 --> 01:13:04,582
he knows all about my mama

1813
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:05,583
and I shot out there and

1814
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:06,583
I said, "What's up, doc?"

1815
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,791
Johnny wants to love you.

1816
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:10,916
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1817
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,458
The name's Laura.

1818
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:13,750
Let's fucking go.

1819
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,458
Let's fucking go.

1820
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:16,999
So, let's kick it and go.

1821
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,165
Yeah, we're doing this.

1822
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:19,499
You're all fucking dead.

1823
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,083
My god, read the room.

1824
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,500
I'm not looking for company.

1825
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,583
Get out of here.

1826
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:40,875
You remind me of an angry drunk name.

1827
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,415
Sounds like a great guy.

1828
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:43,416
It wasn't finished.

1829
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:46,731
Showed up when it mattered the most.

1830
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,458
Couldn't help it.

1831
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:55,250
You might not know it, but

1832
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:57,375
you're a good man, Logan.

1833
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:01,040
You might not know it, but

1834
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,041
apparently I'm the worst,

1835
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:03,333
Logan.

1836
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,375
I got to have a life because of you.

1837
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:10,946
I got to grow up because of you.

1838
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,416
A lot of kids did.

1839
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:15,916
A lot of kids didn't

1840
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:16,958
grow up because of me.

1841
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,458
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1842
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,166
That suit says different.

1843
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:24,791
Yeah, what do you like it?

1844
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:25,833
What do you like it?

1845
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:31,583
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1846
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:34,375
So did Gene, Storm, Beast.

1847
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:37,958
All of them.

1848
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,750
Wanted me to be part of the team.

1849
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,458
Told them they all

1850
01:14:43,459 --> 01:14:44,500
looked fucking ridiculous.

1851
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:48,915
I couldn't have them

1852
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,250
thinking I wanted to be there.

1853
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,165
And then one day,

1854
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:58,332
while I was off on my own,

1855
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,333
the humans came.

1856
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,291
And went mutant hunting.

1857
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:03,875
I can guess the rest.

1858
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,416
No, no, let me.

1859
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:07,750
Let me say it.

1860
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:12,166
I need to say it.

1861
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:15,125
By the time I stumbled

1862
01:15:15,126 --> 01:15:16,540
on shit face from the bar,

1863
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:17,541
it was too late.

1864
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:22,708
It was dead, every...

1865
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:30,790
This suit's all I got to

1866
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:33,708
remind me of who they were.

1867
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:35,708
And what I did.

1868
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,273
We're headed to Cassandra's at Sohm.

1869
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,875
Have fun in my fight.

1870
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,500
We won't pull this off without you.

1871
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:06,790
Hey, whoever you think I

1872
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:07,875
am, you got the wrong guy.

1873
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,575
You were always the wrong guy.

1874
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:39,250
What?

1875
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:41,000
Elias didn't get them.

1876
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:43,083
Sonner wanted to play

1877
01:16:43,084 --> 01:16:44,166
with them herself first.

1878
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:45,166
They got away.

1879
01:16:45,416 --> 01:16:46,416
Did they find the others?

1880
01:16:46,583 --> 01:16:46,833
No.

1881
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:48,456
Good, all right, you fool.

1882
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,708
The others found them.

1883
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,500
Oh, very cute, well done, Pyro.

1884
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:52,541
Classic baby swish,

1885
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:53,333
you really got me there.

1886
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,375
Relax.

1887
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:57,208
They come after Nova, she'll handle it.

1888
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,416
Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.

1889
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:00,250
Why do you think we put

1890
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:01,411
her there in the first place?

1891
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:02,500
I'm told she's never

1892
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:03,541
chosen to leave the void.

1893
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:05,290
The time river is

1894
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:06,500
hours away from completion.

1895
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:07,833
I can't take any chances.

1896
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,875
Maybe not, but I can.

1897
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:11,208
For a price.

1898
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:12,333
Why do you have to say

1899
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,250
it, that silly voice?

1900
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:14,333
It's so icky.

1901
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,458
You want it done or not?

1902
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,000
All right, your price, take her out.

1903
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:20,125
Mutants.

1904
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:20,833
Woo!

1905
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:22,533
Bring them out, bring them out

1906
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:23,875
Bring them out, bring them out

1907
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:25,290
It's hard to yell when

1908
01:17:25,291 --> 01:17:26,541
the bad rails in your mouth

1909
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,750
Come on

1910
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:29,158
Bring them out, bring them out

1911
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:31,458
Hey Bring them out, bring them out

1912
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,458
Yeah, if you keep coming

1913
01:17:32,459 --> 01:17:33,708
live, I'm gonna be happy

1914
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,124
Heard the night light go

1915
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,541
bright, would that be both

1916
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:38,666
Baby, stay warm, see by me

1917
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:40,458
The whole city gets a little dirty

1918
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,332
Look at that, yeah.

1919
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,665
See them big old hands coming through?

1920
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:45,125
Is there not a

1921
01:17:45,126 --> 01:17:46,290
one-hundred-nothing inside?

1922
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,582
What Gambit's trying to say

1923
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,125
is getting Juggernaut's helmet

1924
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:50,458
ain't gonna be easy.

1925
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,976
I'm just making stuff up with this.

1926
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,083
Yeah, tilt up to blame.

1927
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:53,708
Run!

1928
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:54,166
This is

1929
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:54,958
the same thing to Philly,

1930
01:17:54,959 --> 01:17:56,039
I haven't heard any checks.

1931
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:56,708
I don't think you should.

1932
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,625
I don't think you should.

1933
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,273
Where do you get that little beauty?

1934
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,250
That's the one that shares 18 floors.

1935
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:03,333
What's the punishment?

1936
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:04,865
There's been like five of them.

1937
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:06,036
There's only been one blade.

1938
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,290
There's only ever gonna be one blade.

1939
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:09,208
Bring them out, go on the

1940
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:10,500
last show, better than last

1941
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,125
I got a one-hundred-nothing inside

1942
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:13,908
Bring them out, bring them out

1943
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:19,583
Bring them out, bring them out

1944
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:22,208
Bring them out, bring them out

1945
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:23,000
Bring them out, bring them out

1946
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:24,416
Bring them out, bring them out

1947
01:18:24,417 --> 01:18:32,417
You better get on your wheel

1948
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:54,708
You're my master

1949
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:57,290
Boy Who's a Portuguese

1950
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,499
teacher

1951
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:06,500
You better be ready to laughable

1952
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:07,375
I made my way You're aoop
You're aoop And I can't stay

1953
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,041
gloves and jeans

1954
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:12,791
My name is

1955
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:22,125
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1956
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:23,790
You know how long I've

1957
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:24,791
been waiting for this?

1958
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:26,166
Whoo, I'm about to make

1959
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:27,416
a name for myself here.

1960
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:28,416
I don't think you

1961
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:29,624
guys walk away from this.

1962
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:30,749
You just make sure people know what

1963
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:31,750
happened here today.

1964
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:32,666
When you get out of here,

1965
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:33,875
you have a drink for me, yeah?

1966
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:35,666
You'll stay without six, get inside.

1967
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:37,898
We'll make sure you get the package.

1968
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:39,875
And we'll get our ending.

1969
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:23,958
Some motherfucker's still

1970
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:25,119
trying to hide skate up here.

1971
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:34,000
You two escaping I could live with,

1972
01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:36,750
but coming back, willingly.

1973
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:40,125
Boys are so silly.

1974
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:41,666
I just need to get home.

1975
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:43,916
Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.

1976
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:45,832
It's death or

1977
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,750
enslavement, and a cart, of course.

1978
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,083
Up to the...

1979
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,207
Finally, it's nice to give

1980
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,583
someone else a chance to talk.

1981
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:58,875
Not my strength, sir.

1982
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:18,750
Should've known I'd die.

1983
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:39,916
Adios, Ben Nihon.

1984
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,166
You are an interesting one, aren't you?

1985
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:46,499
I do feel like you get

1986
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,041
lost behind all of this.

1987
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:52,665
Deadpools are a dime a

1988
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:53,791
dozen here in the void.

1989
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,541
But you, what's going on in here?

1990
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:14,666
Interesting.

1991
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:18,083
How are they selected back here?

1992
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:19,916
Behind the anchor.

1993
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:25,958
You're hiding from them,

1994
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:28,916
from all the ones you let down.

1995
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:32,750
So much pain.

1996
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:36,625
I walked away.

1997
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:40,500
They called after me and I walked away.

1998
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,750
I always do.

1999
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:44,416
I know.

2000
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:49,041
That's not all you did, is it?

2001
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:55,916
You found them, the X-Men?

2002
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:02,000
Dead.

2003
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:03,333
Dead?

2004
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:06,416
But I would.

2005
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:09,125
What did you do?

2006
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:15,000
I started killing and I couldn't stop.

2007
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:16,458
I didn't want to stop.

2008
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:20,458
All those bad men.

2009
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:25,958
It's not just the bad ones.

2010
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:28,875
My little animal.

2011
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:32,583
I turned the whole

2012
01:24:32,584 --> 01:24:34,416
world against the X-Men.

2013
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:42,166
I just was.

2014
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:45,832
I want to be the man

2015
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:47,083
that Charles Stoker was.

2016
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:52,207
Logan, in the void you

2017
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:53,208
can be, hold to you all.

2018
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:58,333
I just want to be free.

2019
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:01,291
I can set you free.

2020
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:12,291
I can silence all those
voices. I've got you.

2021
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:28,958
I've got you.

2022
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,958
I got you.

2023
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:44,790
You're gonna send us home

2024
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:45,750
where I'm gonna twist

2025
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,750
your fucking head off.

2026
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:48,083
Why are you laughing?

2027
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:50,499
I can't send you unless you

2028
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,041
get this thing off my head.

2029
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,250
And as soon as you do that,

2030
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:55,624
I'm going to boil your

2031
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:56,999
brains on an atomic level

2032
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,499
whilst flicking my bean

2033
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,124
to the end of your box set.

2034
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:01,458
This end of your box set?

2035
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,000
Either you kill me or I kill you.

2036
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,125
Both wonderful options.

2037
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:07,958
You want me to do it?

2038
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,540
No, Hollywood.

2039
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:10,291
I have her net right

2040
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:11,790
here, it's really no problem.

2041
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:12,458
You'll screw it up.

2042
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,040
Oh come on, Mr. PT-13

2043
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:15,041
except the last one.

2044
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:17,041
What the fuck?

2045
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:19,582
No, no, no.

2046
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:21,500
You have no idea what it's like.

2047
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:24,500
Day after day, shovel the shit.

2048
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:26,041
Fetch the meats.

2049
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,416
I have spent my entire...

2050
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:30,208
Steven!

2051
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:32,541
Not everyone gets a speech.

2052
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:35,958
She's gonna die.

2053
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:36,708
Okay, hey, hey, if I

2054
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:37,708
take this helmet off,

2055
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,200
you promise you won't kill us.

2056
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:42,000
I promise I will kill you first.

2057
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:43,625
Why are you like this?

2058
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:44,916
I wish I knew.

2059
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:45,875
Take it off.

2060
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:46,708
What?

2061
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:47,208
Take it off.

2062
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:47,916
Why?

2063
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:48,333
Just take it off.

2064
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:50,083
This is our only chance to fix our shit.

2065
01:26:50,166 --> 01:26:51,166
Take it off!

2066
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,208
I am wearing a suit.

2067
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,874
And that means a lot of things,

2068
01:26:56,875 --> 01:27:00,166
but most of all, it means I'm an X-Man.

2069
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:02,750
And I know your brother.

2070
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:06,957
As much as I'm gonna fucking kill you,

2071
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:07,875
every bone in my body

2072
01:27:07,876 --> 01:27:09,166
must fucking kill you.

2073
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:10,707
He would not let me

2074
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,416
stand here and watch you die.

2075
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
To Ganzhoff.

2076
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:18,916
This is for him.

2077
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,916
This is for Charles.

2078
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,486
Don't you dare do it like Johnny.

2079
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:42,958
My brother loved you.

2080
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:45,666
He loved all of us?

2081
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:49,875
Hmm. Must be nice.

2082
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:52,411
He would have loved you too.

2083
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,375
If he knew about you,

2084
01:27:58,333 --> 01:27:59,874
if he knew where you were,

2085
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:00,541
he would have torn a

2086
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:01,874
hole in the fucking universe

2087
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:03,000
to bring you home.

2088
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:08,041
This is for him.

2089
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:10,541
At least let us save his.

2090
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:14,083
No, I'm not gonna say that.

2091
01:28:14,084 --> 01:28:16,625
I'm not gonna say that. You
wanna hear something crazy?

2092
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:19,999
And I'm a cheer magician

2093
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,040
who rolled through here

2094
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:22,041
a while back.

2095
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:23,916
I killed him, of course,

2096
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:26,916
wore his skin around for four days.

2097
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:31,916
But I felt this little trinket

2098
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:34,625
on his lovely fingers.

2099
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:36,958
Strange.

2100
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:40,625
Very sparkly circle.

2101
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:42,083
What is that?

2102
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:43,625
This is your way home.

2103
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:46,374
I do owe you for saving my life,

2104
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,750
but let's keep things interesting.

2105
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:49,833
I'd say you have about four seconds

2106
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,083
before your life's through.

2107
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:57,375
Race you.

2108
01:29:02,416 --> 01:29:04,875
I'll be seeing you

2109
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:08,750
In all the old familiar

2110
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:10,666
I'll answer

2111
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:12,833
You got this heart

2112
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:15,958
Embrace you

2113
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:18,166
All day through

2114
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:25,083
In that small cafe

2115
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:30,583
Your trash can wait

2116
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:36,000
And the jungle is here so

2117
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,708
The jungle is waiting

2118
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:41,208
We shall know

2119
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:46,875
I'll be seeing you

2120
01:29:48,375 --> 01:29:52,000
In every lovely summer's day

2121
01:29:52,791 --> 01:29:57,041
I'll find you in the morning sun

2122
01:29:58,041 --> 01:30:01,541
And when the night is through

2123
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:08,208
I'll be looking at the moon

2124
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:16,083
But I'll be seeing you

2125
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:22,416
As I guess, we got a standard three year

2126
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,541
bummer to bummer warranty.

2127
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:25,250
Glad you gave us a second chance.

2128
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:27,415
And don't worry, Wade and I are a team,

2129
01:30:27,416 --> 01:30:28,616
so I'll see you again after...

2130
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:33,707
That feels like a

2131
01:30:33,708 --> 01:30:35,708
fucking kid car, wasn't it?

2132
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:36,958
Oh.

2133
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:40,166
Holy shit, that's Deadpool.

2134
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:41,750
That's Wolverine.

2135
01:30:41,751 --> 01:30:42,875
You damn straight it is.

2136
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:44,125
Fox killed him.

2137
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:45,083
Disney brought him back.

2138
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:45,666
They're gonna make him

2139
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:46,833
do this till he's 90.

2140
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:48,583
Let's go.

2141
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:50,250
I'll clock you out.

2142
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:51,750
Forever.

2143
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:53,791
Forever.

2144
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:02,041
Wakey wakey.

2145
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:03,458
Okay.

2146
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:07,540
Now you put all these bullets in my belly

2147
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:09,916
and I'm gonna find out why.

2148
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:11,625
Whoa, whoa!

2149
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:13,708
How'd you say it?

2150
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:14,958
You don't have to

2151
01:31:14,959 --> 01:31:16,333
stick your fingers in me.

2152
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:18,416
Jesus, just ask sometimes.

2153
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:20,333
Fine.

2154
01:31:21,708 --> 01:31:22,708
Really?

2155
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:24,083
Hands and pockets.

2156
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:26,958
A guy named Herodox.

2157
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:29,438
He said he'd give me out of the void.

2158
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,900
All I know is he works for the TVA.

2159
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:31,750
The TVA?

2160
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:32,500
You didn't agree with him.

2161
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:33,458
I didn't agree with him.

2162
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,000
I don't think this guy cares.

2163
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:37,416
Huh, he will.

2164
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:39,999
Hey people, how much longer

2165
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,375
before the time repper is active?

2166
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:43,186
We're running the final safety checks.

2167
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:44,832
Oh, okay, all right,

2168
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:45,666
thanks for all your hard work,

2169
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:46,666
Ralph, take a jump.

2170
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:47,000
Really?

2171
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,000
No, you drooling boob.

2172
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,458
No, we have company,

2173
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,708
cancel the safety checks.

2174
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,166
We need to be live now.

2175
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:55,000
Oh, I saved you so much.

2176
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:59,833
No, stop, piss off, you're too late.

2177
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:00,708
Fucking done.

2178
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:02,083
I was more crying.

2179
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:03,582
How dare you?

2180
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:05,208
No one comes back from the void.

2181
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,750
Tell that to Cassandra Nolva.

2182
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:17,625
Peridox, we have a problem.

2183
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:22,166
Peridox?

2184
01:32:24,291 --> 01:32:25,624
When you are dourier than

2185
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:26,785
you looked in Peridox's head,

2186
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,125
you tried to kill me.

2187
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:29,458
I literally have no idea.

2188
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:33,625
I'm the king, you better kill the king.

2189
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:35,790
Oh, welcome to the

2190
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:37,291
skull fuck club, Peridox.

2191
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:39,666
You know she doesn't wash that ass.

2192
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:42,041
Oh, what's this?

2193
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:46,333
A time repper, a naughty boy.

2194
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:47,707
Oh no, we're on it, we're gonna head down

2195
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:48,999
and dismantle that thing now.

2196
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
We got you, boo, you just

2197
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
keep playing those keys.

2198
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,000
I don't want to destroy it.

2199
01:32:53,625 --> 01:32:54,916
I want to use it.

2200
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:56,957
Now shoot, mommy and daddy

2201
01:32:56,958 --> 01:32:57,998
are having a conversation.

2202
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:05,875
You know the funny things?

2203
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:07,875
I was happy in the void.

2204
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:10,624
You sent no trash to me,

2205
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:11,958
the life that I cleaned it up.

2206
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:14,000
Everyone was happy.

2207
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:16,083
And you had to go and

2208
01:33:16,084 --> 01:33:17,791
piss on my side of the front.

2209
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:20,125
And so now the fence must come down.

2210
01:33:21,416 --> 01:33:22,916
I'm going to use a little time repper

2211
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,083
and I'm going to destroy this universe

2212
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:28,875
and the next and the next and the next

2213
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,416
until all that's left is done.

2214
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:34,375
And I get to pray God.

2215
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:36,125
Come on.

2216
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:38,124
Now, who are going to show me how to use

2217
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:39,416
this fancy gadget of yours?

2218
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:41,207
Don't worry, I've called some friends

2219
01:33:41,208 --> 01:33:42,666
and they sure were not disturbed.

2220
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,375
Sorry to bother, madam,

2221
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:48,896
but there's something you need to see.

2222
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:50,790
We're getting indications of an

2223
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:51,791
unsanctioned time repper

2224
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,708
activating on Earth 1005.

2225
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Whose district is that?

2226
01:33:58,416 --> 01:33:59,416
Paradox.

2227
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:10,999
Well, thank you so much

2228
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
for your help, darling.

2229
01:34:12,708 --> 01:34:14,583
God, good to get out of that head.

2230
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:16,125
What a mess.

2231
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:25,000
Stop.

2232
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:26,208
Let's give it a beat

2233
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:27,208
for the extra stick-lear.

2234
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:28,583
Go, go, go, go.

2235
01:34:28,916 --> 01:34:29,916
Oh my God.

2236
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:36,875
Oh my God.

2237
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:44,833
It's gone.

2238
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,541
It's gone.

2239
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:48,833
Come on, girl.

2240
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:57,041
Come on, girl.

2241
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:13,832
My girl, we don't have to

2242
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,625
be a car ever, ever again.

2243
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:16,791
Never, ever again.

2244
01:35:17,083 --> 01:35:17,291
Sorry.

2245
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:18,583
Fuck.

2246
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:21,000
What's cafe gratitude doing here?

2247
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,250
Sorry about that.

2248
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:24,083
Tremble nut, sweet Mary Evans.

2249
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:25,833
Oh, that's a little...

2250
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:26,916
Come here, girl.

2251
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:27,541
Papazia.

2252
01:35:27,541 --> 01:35:28,541
Hey, do not insult

2253
01:35:28,542 --> 01:35:29,791
this animal's autonomy.

2254
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:32,375
She can decide who her papa is.

2255
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:34,033
What's it gonna be, girl, huh?

2256
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:35,083
Original recipe?

2257
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:36,500
Or then milder here.

2258
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:37,958
Oh, it's funny.

2259
01:35:38,208 --> 01:35:39,958
I can gently tap the fourth wall too.

2260
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:41,583
The proposal.

2261
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:44,583
The fuck was that?

2262
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:46,151
Bitch, you think that's what I do?

2263
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,250
Both of you, shut up.

2264
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:49,375
You smell something?

2265
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:50,583
Yeah, you.

2266
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:54,291
A lot of you.

2267
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:08,625
Don't you know a lot

2268
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:09,625
of Deadpools over there?

2269
01:36:21,791 --> 01:36:22,791
That's bad.

2270
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:46,458
I take it they're not friendly.

2271
01:36:46,708 --> 01:36:47,458
Goodness, no.

2272
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,666
Sorry about this, boys.

2273
01:36:48,916 --> 01:36:49,375
Mission over.

2274
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:51,041
Cause of death, 100.

2275
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:52,625
Kill thirsty Deadpools.

2276
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:54,625
They're dumb, but they can fight.

2277
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:55,833
Not me though.

2278
01:36:55,834 --> 01:36:56,957
I'd love to get in the mix,

2279
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:58,124
but I have low bone density

2280
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,791
and I have to keep my face safe.

2281
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,416
Hold please.

2282
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:02,083
Oh, okay.

2283
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:03,083
All right, look.

2284
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:04,916
Guys!

2285
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:07,333
Deadpool Prime here.

2286
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:09,374
Our fight isn't with you.

2287
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:10,750
Hey, when I want your opinions,

2288
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:12,165
I'll take Wolverine's

2289
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:13,291
dick out of your mouth.

2290
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:14,875
That's Kidpool, she's the dirtiest.

2291
01:37:15,125 --> 01:37:16,125
Can we just be done?

2292
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,166
Ooh, we're just getting started.

2293
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:18,750
No, no, no, no, no.

2294
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,166
With the whole multiverse thing.

2295
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,750
It's not great.

2296
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,124
It's just been miss

2297
01:37:25,125 --> 01:37:28,791
after miss after miss.

2298
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,582
Wizard of Oz did the multiverse first

2299
01:37:31,583 --> 01:37:32,749
and they did it best.

2300
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:35,375
The gays knew it, but we didn't listen.

2301
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,999
Let's just take the I and move on.

2302
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,666
I think it's been

2303
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,291
steadily great since Endgame.

2304
01:37:41,541 --> 01:37:42,999
What are you talking about?

2305
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,582
The multiverse is over.

2306
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:45,749
Sandy gonna destroy the

2307
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:47,000
fuck out of every time.

2308
01:37:47,958 --> 01:37:49,290
I don't care to do shit about it.

2309
01:37:49,291 --> 01:37:49,958
Do you not get it?

2310
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:50,750
If we don't get out of

2311
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:51,625
the subway, it's stopped

2312
01:37:51,626 --> 01:37:52,666
or we all die.

2313
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:53,458
Say the boss lady

2314
01:37:53,459 --> 01:37:54,750
don't want no disturbance.

2315
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,320
You wanna get down to the subway?

2316
01:37:56,541 --> 01:37:57,791
You gotta go through what?

2317
01:37:57,875 --> 01:37:58,875
Lizzy time, baby.

2318
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:00,125
Lizzy time, baby.

2319
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:01,375
Look alive.

2320
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:11,458
I think I'm hit.

2321
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,458
Oh shit, you did that on purpose.

2322
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:14,875
I did no such thing.

2323
01:38:15,208 --> 01:38:16,208
Listen to me, gorgeous.

2324
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:16,875
How long does it take

2325
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:17,875
for you to regenerate?

2326
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:19,208
Regenerate?

2327
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:26,374
You really are God's

2328
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:27,457
perfect idiot, aren't you?

2329
01:38:27,458 --> 01:38:27,750
I'm okay.

2330
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:29,165
How dare you, you

2331
01:38:29,166 --> 01:38:30,666
insensitive son of a bitch.

2332
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:31,625
How was I supposed to

2333
01:38:31,626 --> 01:38:32,750
know he doesn't regenerate?

2334
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:34,083
I'm not a medicine woman.

2335
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:35,791
Look, a donut cart.

2336
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,200
They're practically hospitals.

2337
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:38,916
They sell portable triage units.

2338
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:39,250
I know.

2339
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:40,411
I'm gonna get you to safety.

2340
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:41,000
Please, Papa.

2341
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:42,083
Deep breath.

2342
01:38:50,541 --> 01:38:52,416
Hey, where are we stopping?

2343
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:53,875
Just catching my breath.

2344
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:55,250
Are your legs on vacation?

2345
01:38:55,791 --> 01:38:56,791
You're dead weight.

2346
01:38:57,083 --> 01:38:58,250
Just because I'm paralyzed.

2347
01:38:58,583 --> 01:38:59,750
We all have problems.

2348
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:00,958
Listen to me.

2349
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:02,041
You're gonna live.

2350
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:03,958
Look at me, nice call.

2351
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,333
Here, come over here.

2352
01:39:10,083 --> 01:39:11,083
Say it.

2353
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:12,833
I'm gonna live.

2354
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:14,625
Say it with me.

2355
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:16,083
You're gonna live.

2356
01:39:16,166 --> 01:39:17,166
You're gonna live.

2357
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:18,708
Ha ha.

2358
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,958
Say it with me.

2359
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:22,416
I'm gonna live.

2360
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:32,375
Hold your fire.

2361
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:35,708
Sweet little puppy.

2362
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:49,000
I don't think he's gonna make it.

2363
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,166
God, he loved his face.

2364
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:53,750
I could taste his final thought.

2365
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:55,291
He was so afraid.

2366
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
But he died a hero.

2367
01:39:57,125 --> 01:39:59,082
He died from murder, you dumb fuck.

2368
01:39:59,083 --> 01:40:00,458
All I have to remember him by

2369
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:03,874
are these two gold-plated,

2370
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,541
50 caliber desert eagle pistol arrows.

2371
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:06,958
This is for him.

2372
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,500
Are you ready?

2373
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:10,583
I get to kill 100 youths.

2374
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:12,458
Fuck you, I'm ready.

2375
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:14,999
You don't wanna see this, bro.

2376
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,083
That's a good girl.

2377
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:23,583
Life is a mystery

2378
01:40:25,041 --> 01:40:28,958
Everyone must stand alone

2379
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:33,541
I hear you cry my name

2380
01:40:34,583 --> 01:40:37,750
And it feels like

2381
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:40,500
I'm home

2382
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:54,208
Holy shit.

2383
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:55,333
You saved the good

2384
01:40:55,334 --> 01:40:56,500
stuff for special occasions?

2385
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,250
Killing mostly.

2386
01:40:58,458 --> 01:40:59,458
What's the wind resistance

2387
01:40:59,459 --> 01:41:00,750
on those blowjob headings?

2388
01:41:02,333 --> 01:41:03,999
Sorry, just a gatty

2389
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
picture, but I'm jealous.

2390
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,500
All right, let's do this.

2391
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,500
Maximum effort.

2392
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:21,708
When I go back to

2393
01:41:22,208 --> 01:41:23,708
Suck a little bit

2394
01:41:24,208 --> 01:41:25,375
I've got so many

2395
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,125
I'm gonna take you back

2396
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:29,750
And leave my head

2397
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:32,083
I can feel your bones

2398
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,041
Just now, oh yeah

2399
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,500
You know I'll take you back

2400
01:41:36,625 --> 01:41:38,000
I see you

2401
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:40,833
I'm gonna take you back

2402
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:12,958
You know you just don't know

2403
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:15,083
You know I'll take you back

2404
01:42:15,375 --> 01:42:16,375
What the fuck?

2405
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:18,208
I wish I would have.

2406
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:23,750
I'm gonna take you back

2407
01:42:24,083 --> 01:42:26,041
Just now, oh yeah

2408
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:35,999
When I go back to

2409
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,583
I'm gonna take you back

2410
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:44,832
I'm gonna take you back

2411
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:47,708
I'm gonna take you back

2412
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:57,375
Come on, I blew it.

2413
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:58,791
After all that, the only

2414
01:42:58,791 --> 01:42:59,583
thing you're gonna remember

2415
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,333
is that god-awful dismount.

2416
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,208
What are you laughing at, little fucker?

2417
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:10,833
Oh no.

2418
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,208
I guess these ones regenerate.

2419
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:20,875
Come on, we have time for this.

2420
01:43:21,375 --> 01:43:23,291
Dead fools, stand down.

2421
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:35,625
This dead fool's with me.

2422
01:43:35,875 --> 01:43:36,875
Oh no.

2423
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,041
Holy shit.

2424
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:39,208
That's fucking Peter.

2425
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,375
Wait, you guys know Peter?

2426
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:45,583
Are you kidding me?

2427
01:43:45,584 --> 01:43:46,833
Every dead fool has a Peter.

2428
01:43:47,041 --> 01:43:49,124
Shit, Peter's a god damn legend

2429
01:43:49,125 --> 01:43:50,625
in every dead fool's world.

2430
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:51,958
Give me something.

2431
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:09,541
Enjoy my Peter.

2432
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,458
Oh, now you're here.

2433
01:44:38,459 --> 01:44:40,249
Oh well, you're too late, it's all over.

2434
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,083
Not yet, it's not.

2435
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:42,605
No, no, no, no, but we're very close.

2436
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,120
Homestretch, folks, promise.

2437
01:44:44,458 --> 01:44:45,750
Quick, let's have the steaks.

2438
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:47,441
If she steals the time represented,

2439
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:48,707
she has the power to shred

2440
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:50,040
the fabric of all the realities

2441
01:44:50,041 --> 01:44:51,681
until there is nothing left but the void.

2442
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:53,041
How do we shut it down?

2443
01:44:53,416 --> 01:44:54,416
I don't know.

2444
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:58,915
The mask is really intimidating, huh?

2445
01:44:58,916 --> 01:44:59,583
It's like Batman

2446
01:44:59,584 --> 01:45:00,916
except he can move his neck.

2447
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:02,916
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.

2448
01:45:03,666 --> 01:45:04,832
The Ripper is fed from a

2449
01:45:04,833 --> 01:45:06,041
secure chamber below ground.

2450
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:07,624
It is powered by twin

2451
01:45:07,625 --> 01:45:09,375
matter and antimatter feeds

2452
01:45:09,458 --> 01:45:10,624
converging inside the device.

2453
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:11,874
Now Cassandra Nova is

2454
01:45:11,875 --> 01:45:13,040
redirecting the Ripper's power

2455
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:13,916
to eliminate all

2456
01:45:13,917 --> 01:45:15,416
timelines, starting with this one.

2457
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:16,915
Theoretically, you could stop her

2458
01:45:16,916 --> 01:45:17,875
by short circuiting the

2459
01:45:17,876 --> 01:45:18,956
feeds in the chamber below.

2460
01:45:19,041 --> 01:45:20,082
One of you would create a

2461
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:21,624
circuit between the two feeds,

2462
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:23,207
then the released power

2463
01:45:23,208 --> 01:45:24,666
would destroy the machine.

2464
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:26,583
But, well, come on, man.

2465
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,625
If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.

2466
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Whoever formed the

2467
01:45:30,001 --> 01:45:32,000
bridge would be annihilated.

2468
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:33,000
I could live with that.

2469
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I could live with that too, actually.

2470
01:45:34,001 --> 01:45:35,040
You don't need to survive anything.

2471
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:36,041
We're like cockroaches.

2472
01:45:36,208 --> 01:45:37,208
Not this time.

2473
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:39,458
This is matter and antimatter.

2474
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,874
They do not play nicely with each other.

2475
01:45:41,875 --> 01:45:42,750
When they mix in your

2476
01:45:42,751 --> 01:45:44,541
body, you will be atomized.

2477
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:46,041
Trust the laws of

2478
01:45:46,042 --> 01:45:47,242
physics if you don't trust me.

2479
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:48,333
Even if you lived long

2480
01:45:48,334 --> 01:45:49,414
enough to make the circuit,

2481
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:51,541
you will die down there.

2482
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:18,791
Hold up, hold up.

2483
01:46:19,291 --> 01:46:20,571
You heard that asshole upstairs.

2484
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:22,083
Even if we pull this off,

2485
01:46:22,625 --> 01:46:24,416
we're dead, permanently.

2486
01:46:25,458 --> 01:46:26,625
That's why it's gotta be me.

2487
01:46:26,916 --> 01:46:27,916
What?

2488
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:33,749
Look, man, you didn't

2489
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:34,750
ask for any of this.

2490
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:36,458
You were right.

2491
01:46:37,125 --> 01:46:38,125
I lied.

2492
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,166
I lied right to your face.

2493
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:42,500
Just to get you to help me, you did.

2494
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,500
You didn't lie.

2495
01:46:47,041 --> 01:46:48,083
You made an educated wish.

2496
01:46:51,666 --> 01:46:52,666
Come on.

2497
01:46:53,833 --> 01:46:55,291
You got a whole world to go back to.

2498
01:46:57,208 --> 01:46:58,208
I got nothing.

2499
01:47:00,166 --> 01:47:01,166
I got nothing.

2500
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,916
Give me this.

2501
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,500
Hey.

2502
01:47:20,166 --> 01:47:22,291
I waited a long time for this team up.

2503
01:47:24,083 --> 01:47:25,083
You know something?

2504
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:28,458
You're the best Wolverine.

2505
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:38,866
Say hi to your friends for me.

2506
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:51,750
Open the door.

2507
01:47:53,541 --> 01:47:54,665
I can't hear you over

2508
01:47:54,666 --> 01:47:56,333
all the noble sacrifice.

2509
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:57,875
Why are you fucking doing this?

2510
01:47:58,375 --> 01:48:00,708
Because I'm Marvel Jesus.

2511
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:04,083
We're Spock.

2512
01:48:05,166 --> 01:48:06,166
Aren't you, Sam?

2513
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:11,291
Hey!

2514
01:48:12,375 --> 01:48:13,375
You're fucking it.

2515
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:20,458
Sorry, I'm just stalling.

2516
01:48:21,041 --> 01:48:22,791
I think I'm nervous about dying.

2517
01:48:23,666 --> 01:48:24,666
You should be me.

2518
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:27,291
Say hi to my friends for me, Peter.

2519
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:27,958
Why?

2520
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,915
You wanna be an annoying type?

2521
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:30,666
You're just sorry.

2522
01:48:30,875 --> 01:48:32,625
You're gonna die again, you don't fuck.

2523
01:48:39,833 --> 01:48:41,375
Hey, you don't need to do this.

2524
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:43,625
I'm not doing it because I need it.

2525
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:46,166
I'm doing it because they do.

2526
01:48:57,541 --> 01:48:58,541
No!

2527
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:16,208
No!

2528
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:18,791
All right.

2529
01:49:28,375 --> 01:49:29,375
He's not gonna make it.

2530
01:49:38,583 --> 01:49:39,583
It's over.

2531
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:50,708
The Wolverine is a hero in my world.

2532
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,500
Whoever you think I am,

2533
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,500
you got the wrong guy.

2534
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:59,291
You were always the wrong guy.

2535
01:51:00,791 --> 01:51:01,791
Till you weren't.

2536
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:05,625
Wait.

2537
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:11,916
Wait, you can finally, finally, matter.

2538
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:32,125
Phyllis. I've seen Vanessa.

2539
01:51:36,458 --> 01:51:40,665
For the first time in

2540
01:51:40,666 --> 01:51:42,208
my life, I am proud.

2541
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:44,125
The way it is.

2542
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:46,541
He means I'm an ex-man.

2543
01:51:48,958 --> 01:51:50,833
I am the ex-man.

2544
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:36,416
Tarrantox.

2545
01:52:38,708 --> 01:52:39,708
You've been busy.

2546
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:41,208
Well, somebody has been.

2547
01:52:41,208 --> 01:52:42,000
We had some strange

2548
01:52:42,001 --> 01:52:43,125
readings from this location.

2549
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,707
You wouldn't know anything about an

2550
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:45,832
unsanctioned time river,

2551
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:46,833
would you?

2552
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:48,832
No, no, I wouldn't know anything

2553
01:52:48,833 --> 01:52:50,375
about an unsanctioned time river.

2554
01:52:50,791 --> 01:52:52,231
Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova,

2555
01:52:52,291 --> 01:52:53,499
because I was assured that

2556
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,375
she was safely held in the void.

2557
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:56,665
But no, she was here

2558
01:52:56,666 --> 01:52:58,041
and she fondled my brain.

2559
01:52:58,375 --> 01:52:59,291
How did she let this happen?

2560
01:52:59,292 --> 01:53:00,392
You weren't involved at all.

2561
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,458
In stopping her, yes, yes, I was.

2562
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:04,083
But not nearly enough.

2563
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:05,625
Not as much as the men who

2564
01:53:05,626 --> 01:53:06,875
went down there after her.

2565
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:10,041
My men, my friends,

2566
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,415
I warned them, but they would be

2567
01:53:13,416 --> 01:53:14,457
completely obliterated

2568
01:53:14,458 --> 01:53:16,098
if they went, but they went anyway, like,

2569
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,041
like heroes.

2570
01:53:21,458 --> 01:53:22,618
Because that's who they were.

2571
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:27,193
They just did what they had to do.

2572
01:53:28,625 --> 01:53:30,185
We both concerned for their own safety.

2573
01:53:33,791 --> 01:53:35,790
The fact that we are

2574
01:53:35,791 --> 01:53:37,124
all still standing here

2575
01:53:37,125 --> 01:53:39,666
is a testament to their heroism.

2576
01:53:43,541 --> 01:53:44,957
Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do

2577
01:53:44,958 --> 01:53:46,250
to bring them back now.

2578
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:49,875
He has risen baby girl

2579
01:53:50,041 --> 01:53:50,333
Fuck!

2580
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:54,791
And I don't want you to see me

2581
01:53:55,708 --> 01:53:56,999
Cause I don't think

2582
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,041
we're made in any style

2583
01:54:00,458 --> 01:54:03,583
No, everything's made to be broken

2584
01:54:04,708 --> 01:54:07,875
I just want you to know why

2585
01:54:10,416 --> 01:54:11,684
Now, here's your new anchor, Pete.

2586
01:54:11,708 --> 01:54:12,749
And we're doing just

2587
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:13,833
fine in piece of shit.

2588
01:54:15,916 --> 01:54:17,000
Fine indeed.

2589
01:54:17,541 --> 01:54:19,749
All right, put your greasy

2590
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:21,208
tits away, you preening slut.

2591
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:23,500
I don't understand.

2592
01:54:23,958 --> 01:54:25,078
How are you two still alive?

2593
01:54:25,166 --> 01:54:26,374
You're right, one of us

2594
01:54:26,375 --> 01:54:27,375
would have been killed.

2595
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:28,707
But you put a Deadpool

2596
01:54:28,708 --> 01:54:30,166
and a Wolverine together,

2597
01:54:30,583 --> 01:54:31,500
make them hold hands

2598
01:54:31,501 --> 01:54:32,581
while listening to Madonna?

2599
01:54:33,166 --> 01:54:34,875
Indestructible motherfucker.

2600
01:54:35,416 --> 01:54:36,416
Let's get this Deadpool

2601
01:54:36,417 --> 01:54:37,500
variant back to the void.

2602
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,750
Wait, hold on, what?

2603
01:54:38,875 --> 01:54:40,416
Nope, actually, this one's homegrown.

2604
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:42,208
Like me, he belongs here.

2605
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:44,250
And you are?

2606
01:54:44,291 --> 01:54:45,291
Peter Poole.

2607
01:54:45,333 --> 01:54:46,375
But you can call me Peter.

2608
01:54:48,375 --> 01:54:49,375
And I hope that you do.

2609
01:54:55,916 --> 01:54:57,458
What the fuck is happening here?

2610
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,875
You are under judgment

2611
01:54:59,291 --> 01:55:00,000
for operating an

2612
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:01,166
unsanctioned time-ripper.

2613
01:55:01,375 --> 01:55:01,583
Take it.

2614
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:02,583
I was just doing what you

2615
01:55:02,584 --> 01:55:03,916
don't have the guts to do.

2616
01:55:04,333 --> 01:55:05,707
Get off, get off, your

2617
01:55:05,708 --> 01:55:06,958
fists want hands off fists.

2618
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:10,500
I'm grateful, gentlemen.

2619
01:55:11,791 --> 01:55:12,791
Let's hold the bowels.

2620
01:55:13,041 --> 01:55:14,249
You led an Omega level

2621
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,624
mutant to this timeline.

2622
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:16,000
You're welcome.

2623
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:17,665
And you shouldn't even

2624
01:55:17,666 --> 01:55:18,708
be near this timeline.

2625
01:55:18,958 --> 01:55:19,166
He's welcome.

2626
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,583
And you look damn good in that suit.

2627
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:23,958
I'm so sorry.

2628
01:55:28,541 --> 01:55:29,621
I wanna show you something.

2629
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:31,750
Something huge.

2630
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:32,458
That's what

2631
01:55:32,459 --> 01:55:34,041
Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.

2632
01:55:35,708 --> 01:55:36,708
Do you see that?

2633
01:55:37,416 --> 01:55:39,000
Your universe is regenerating.

2634
01:55:40,083 --> 01:55:41,957
Whatever you did here, you

2635
01:55:41,958 --> 01:55:43,500
not only saved your world,

2636
01:55:44,208 --> 01:55:46,291
you spared your timeline from extinction.

2637
01:55:48,583 --> 01:55:49,583
I've messed up.

2638
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:50,833
I have a feeling your work

2639
01:55:50,834 --> 01:55:52,125
is only just getting started.

2640
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:53,708
Till you're 90.

2641
01:55:54,625 --> 01:55:55,625
Wait!

2642
01:55:56,541 --> 01:55:57,976
We couldn't have made it out of the void

2643
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,415
without some help from some people

2644
01:56:01,416 --> 01:56:03,666
that the world kinda forgot.

2645
01:56:04,541 --> 01:56:05,333
Is there any way that

2646
01:56:05,334 --> 01:56:06,541
you could maybe find a way

2647
01:56:07,083 --> 01:56:08,083
to bring them home?

2648
01:56:09,833 --> 01:56:10,833
I'll see what I can do.

2649
01:56:11,291 --> 01:56:13,082
And I promised my friend here

2650
01:56:13,083 --> 01:56:15,082
that the TVA could undo

2651
01:56:15,083 --> 01:56:16,457
some pretty awful shit

2652
01:56:16,458 --> 01:56:17,458
in his timeline.

2653
01:56:17,708 --> 01:56:18,788
What would you say to that?

2654
01:56:19,125 --> 01:56:20,125
Changed the past.

2655
01:56:21,333 --> 01:56:22,533
He did help me save the world.

2656
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,416
And his past made him the man who did it.

2657
01:56:26,541 --> 01:56:28,625
There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.

2658
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:32,583
Look at him.

2659
01:56:35,041 --> 01:56:36,125
Torma, I get to eat now.

2660
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:47,541
You know the Avengers discovered Torma.

2661
01:56:49,583 --> 01:56:50,583
I'd be lucky to have you.

2662
01:57:00,666 --> 01:57:01,666
Fuck off!

2663
01:57:03,041 --> 01:57:04,125
Hold my little country,

2664
01:57:04,708 --> 01:57:07,250
he has a deal, you're up through fiber.

2665
01:57:08,208 --> 01:57:10,583
Look, all is right in the world.

2666
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:13,291
Yes it is.

2667
01:57:14,916 --> 01:57:16,116
So what are you gonna do next?

2668
01:57:17,833 --> 01:57:18,833
I'll figure it out.

2669
01:57:18,958 --> 01:57:19,958
I always do.

2670
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:21,833
All right.

2671
01:57:22,833 --> 01:57:24,113
So I'll probably see you around.

2672
01:57:29,166 --> 01:57:30,166
Probably not.

2673
01:57:33,666 --> 01:57:34,666
See you, mother.

2674
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:40,333
Hogan!

2675
01:57:51,166 --> 01:57:53,083
Al, my back.

2676
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:56,332
About damn time, you hold it.

2677
01:57:56,333 --> 01:57:58,040
I'm all out of devil's dancin'

2678
01:57:58,041 --> 01:58:00,208
and I'm shaking like an angry fireplace.

2679
01:58:00,291 --> 01:58:01,291
Thank you, Al.

2680
01:58:01,416 --> 01:58:02,416
We have company.

2681
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,791
Althea, this is Logan.

2682
01:58:06,375 --> 01:58:07,625
Nice to meet you, Logan.

2683
01:58:07,833 --> 01:58:08,666
Nice to meet you too.

2684
01:58:08,708 --> 01:58:09,708
And this little ancient,

2685
01:58:09,709 --> 01:58:12,000
anal shit-knot is Mary Poppins.

2686
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:14,125
Or as I like to call her, dog pool.

2687
01:58:14,666 --> 01:58:15,208
You wanna treat

2688
01:58:15,209 --> 01:58:16,329
yourself to a little stroke?

2689
01:58:17,166 --> 01:58:18,708
Look at the tongue.

2690
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:20,708
Oh my God, motherfucker!

2691
01:58:21,375 --> 01:58:22,125
Right, it's like an

2692
01:58:22,126 --> 01:58:23,583
armadillo fucked a gremlin,

2693
01:58:24,125 --> 01:58:26,291
angrily, in a bed of gonorrhea,

2694
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:28,666
and didn't stop till the sun came up.

2695
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:31,875
Everyone wants to matter.

2696
01:58:32,875 --> 01:58:33,915
Turns out that you don't need to be

2697
01:58:33,916 --> 01:58:35,208
more than Jesus to do it.

2698
01:58:36,333 --> 01:58:37,000
You just need to open

2699
01:58:37,001 --> 01:58:38,291
your eyes and look around.

2700
01:58:39,291 --> 01:58:40,291
And if you're lucky,

2701
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,208
you'll find a few friends.

2702
01:58:43,291 --> 01:58:46,833
Old friends and some new ones too.

2703
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:52,374
Give me the fucking

2704
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:53,375
dog, talk to the girl.

2705
01:59:04,208 --> 01:59:05,208
Oh, hi.

2706
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,500
Hi.

2707
01:59:08,541 --> 01:59:09,750
You've been busy?

2708
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:14,041
I did it for you.

2709
01:59:16,166 --> 01:59:19,083
If you don't want me, I did it for you.

2710
01:59:21,958 --> 01:59:29,958
Turns out, I am the world's saving type.

2711
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:33,041
Just look around this

2712
01:59:33,042 --> 01:59:34,166
table if you want proof.

2713
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:36,500
For the best part,

2714
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:38,875
sometimes the people we save,

2715
01:59:40,291 --> 01:59:41,291
they save us right back.

2716
02:00:21,875 --> 02:00:23,500
You are not the only one with gifts.

2717
02:00:24,041 --> 02:00:25,041
What is this place?

2718
02:00:35,833 --> 02:00:37,624
Another turn and boy, a

2719
02:00:37,625 --> 02:00:39,458
fork stuck in the road

2720
02:00:40,666 --> 02:00:41,999
I grabbed you by the

2721
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,583
rest, direct you where to go

2722
02:00:45,666 --> 02:00:47,290
Don't make the best of

2723
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:49,375
this test and notice why

2724
02:00:50,666 --> 02:00:54,125
It's not in question but a lesson in time

2725
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:55,250
Hi, you.

2726
02:00:55,333 --> 02:00:56,333
This is Stanley.

2727
02:01:03,916 --> 02:01:06,415
I really like the art

2728
02:01:06,416 --> 02:01:07,416
in the Deadpool comics.

2729
02:01:07,708 --> 02:01:08,333
You know, I just always

2730
02:01:08,334 --> 02:01:09,666
felt kind of a kinship to him.

2731
02:01:10,166 --> 02:01:12,375
I like to play that guy someday.

2732
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:42,415
I was there for three weeks

2733
02:01:42,416 --> 02:01:43,791
before I shot a single thing.

2734
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:45,458
For that first day of

2735
02:01:45,459 --> 02:01:48,166
shooting, I was so nervous, man.

2736
02:01:48,833 --> 02:01:49,625
Everyone was sort of

2737
02:01:49,625 --> 02:01:50,625
going, "Use this guy."

2738
02:01:50,958 --> 02:01:52,318
You know, there was a lot of that.

2739
02:01:53,041 --> 02:01:54,000
You know, he was going to deliver

2740
02:01:54,001 --> 02:01:55,207
and you can feel all

2741
02:01:55,208 --> 02:01:56,208
that kind of pressure.

2742
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,416
Always the suits are cold.

2743
02:02:00,083 --> 02:02:01,375
Never be able to do that.

2744
02:02:09,833 --> 02:02:10,999
This is the only way.

2745
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,708
Got something to protect our bones

2746
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,500
And the others right

2747
02:02:16,291 --> 02:02:19,875
I hope you end the time of your life

2748
02:02:20,375 --> 02:02:22,000
Oh, this is what it is.

2749
02:02:25,166 --> 02:02:26,500
And there's Alexa.

2750
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
I'm a medical researcher.

2751
02:02:28,875 --> 02:02:29,875
Bye, media.

2752
02:02:30,083 --> 02:02:31,083
Bye.

2753
02:06:44,458 --> 02:06:47,082
I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors

2754
02:06:47,083 --> 02:06:48,166
that I got Johnny killed.

2755
02:06:49,541 --> 02:06:50,541
Let's look at the tape.

2756
02:06:51,625 --> 02:06:54,416
In the void, you're either food for Elias

2757
02:06:55,125 --> 02:06:56,125
or you work for her.

2758
02:06:59,416 --> 02:07:00,416
Go on, Johnny.

2759
02:07:00,833 --> 02:07:02,000
And I'll tell you who her is.

2760
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:03,541
Cassandra Nova, a

2761
02:07:03,542 --> 02:07:05,416
megalomaniacal psychotic asshole.

2762
02:07:05,791 --> 02:07:07,707
A finger-licking dead inside pixie slab

2763
02:07:07,708 --> 02:07:09,582
at third rate dime store in Ducknell.

2764
02:07:09,583 --> 02:07:10,541
And I'll tell you what she can do.

2765
02:07:10,541 --> 02:07:11,208
I'm listening.

2766
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:11,791
She can lick my

2767
02:07:11,792 --> 02:07:13,124
goddamn cinnamon ring clean

2768
02:07:13,125 --> 02:07:14,833
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

2769
02:07:15,041 --> 02:07:15,916
In fact, I don't give a

2770
02:07:15,917 --> 02:07:17,249
shit if she removes all my skin

2771
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:18,125
and pops me like some

2772
02:07:18,126 --> 02:07:19,166
nightmarish blood balloon.

2773
02:07:19,458 --> 02:07:20,416
If the last thing I do

2774
02:07:20,416 --> 02:07:21,416
with this, God forsaken,

2775
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,500
come gut her existence,

2776
02:07:22,625 --> 02:07:23,915
is like that fuck box on a

2777
02:07:23,916 --> 02:07:25,166
fire I still won't die happy.

2778
02:07:25,416 --> 02:07:27,208
Holy shit, girl, you crazy.

2779
02:07:27,458 --> 02:07:28,083
That's right, wait.

2780
02:07:28,333 --> 02:07:29,790
I won't be happy until I've urinated

2781
02:07:29,791 --> 02:07:31,207
on a freshly barbecued corpse

2782
02:07:31,208 --> 02:07:32,958
and husk fuck that chime remains

2783
02:07:33,166 --> 02:07:35,000
while gargling juggernuts juggernuts.

2784
02:07:35,041 --> 02:07:35,291
Wow.

2785
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:36,625
And you can quote me.

2786
02:07:36,625 --> 02:07:37,625
Okay.

2787
02:07:38,208 --> 02:07:39,208
Gotcha, fuck face.
