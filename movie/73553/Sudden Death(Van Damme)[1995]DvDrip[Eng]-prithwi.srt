1
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,700
- Walk the wall on the left!
- I need a line!

2
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,940
I found her!
I found her!

3
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,860
I need some help
down here!

4
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,860
I need it now!

5
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,940
Anybody hear me?

6
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,780
Get down here now!

7
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,700
Come on!

8
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,100
Shepherd! Burr!

9
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,740
I got her! I can't move!

10
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,980
Come down here now!

11
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,980
Hold on.
They'll be here.

12
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,540
Move!

13
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,700
- I heard a voice.
- Help me!

14
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,340
I can't breathe!

15
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,060
Help me! Help me out!
Help me out!

16
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,180
Help me move it!

17
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,220
Bring up the skycam.
Pan it left.

18
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,620
Show me what God sees.

19
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,780
Okay, camera two, show me the stands.

20
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,100
- Three, give me the ice.
- Okay, graphic is up.

21
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,060
Uh, put game seven on preset.

22
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,500
How many technicians
are gonna be inside the arena?

23
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,820
We got 12 cameramen,
6 support... that's 18.

24
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,780
I want to limit their access.

25
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,140
Technicians and announcers
are the only ones cleared.

26
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,420
Hey, Spota, let us in.

27
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,820
Work don't stop just 'cause the
Vice President's coming, you know, babe.

28
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,740
Must be Republicans.

29
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,140
Having everybody check in through one
gate like this is a pain in the butt.

30
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,540
- It's only one night.
- It's the last game of the Stanley Cup.

31
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,060
Having the Vice President
here turns a headache into a concussion.

32
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,660
- I didn't vote for this guy.
- That's what makes what you're
doin' such a special gesture.

33
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,540
Hello, Pittsburgh.

34
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,380
Here we are in the seventh game of the
Stanley Cup finals. Penguins and Hawks.

35
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,100
Penguins in a come-from-behind
victory to shut down the Hawks.

36
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,620
Shit.

37
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,260
Sorry. Uh, my dog's missing.

38
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,220
We're out looking for him.

39
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,620
- Is it bad?
- What? You think this might be good?

40
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,780
- Let me see your license.
- Oh, sure.

41
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,060
Move. Move.

42
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,500
We are going to steal your car.

43
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,220
Don't get killed over it, huh?

44
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,660
It's the last game.
We got a couple of minutes to go.

45
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,340
Just 15 seconds to go!

46
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,100
He skates up to center.
He knocks down one defender.

47
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,340
He's skating like a madman around
the ice. He gets to the blue line.

48
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,340
He shoots. Whoa!
And he scores! Whoo!

49
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,940
- Scratch my back with a hacksaw...
- Yes!

50
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,980
Dad!

51
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,540
Hey!

52
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,860
- That's a fancy new stick.
- Michael gave it to me.

53
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,140
- Hi.
- How are you, Darren?

54
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,220
Darren, what are you
doing here?

55
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,260
- You can't stay.
We're getting ready to leave.
- It's his birthday.

56
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,540
And you've got him
all day tomorrow.

57
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,580
I just got these.
I thought the kids might wanna...

58
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,580
We're all going out
to dinner.

59
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,780
- Looks like those are Penguin tickets.
- They are.

60
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,620
It's the seventh game.

61
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
- Vice President's gonna be there.
- Daddy! Daddy!

62
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,420
- Hey, that's my hat!
- I can wear it. Mom said I could.

63
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,340
I did?

64
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,620
You know what that means?

65
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,580
- Not a clue.
- It means "I love you."

66
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,460
I love you too.

67
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,660
She's practicing to be deaf,
but that's still my hat!

68
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,820
- I'll get you a new one.
- You can't just take them
without talking to me first.

69
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,940
- Besides, you only have two tickets.
- I'm working at the arena.

70
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,380
- You're back to work, Dad?
- He's a fire inspector at the game.

71
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,740
- It's very important work.
- Are you a fireman again, Daddy?

72
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,060
Kind of, yeah.

73
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,020
Kathi tells me it's only temporary.

74
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,660
- He was trying to save a little
girl in a burning building...
- Are we going to the game?

75
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,020
Don't do this again. I mean it.

76
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,100
It's not fair to the kids... or me.

77
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,060
I promise.

78
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,220
Excuse me.

79
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,500
This is Andrew.
He's the head chef.

80
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,660
Nobody goes in that elevator,
and I mean nobody,

81
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,300
even if they have proper I.D.,
unless this man says it's okay.

82
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,500
If he doesn't know them,
they don't get in that elevator.

83
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,980
After you finish the Vice President's
party, this kitchen is closed.

84
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,100
- Have I made myself clear?
- Abundantly.

85
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,700
That's how I like it.
Abundantly.

86
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,740
Mrs. Ferrara?

87
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,700
Yes?

88
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,180
Let's just stroll into your house
like I'm your favorite nephew.

89
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,740
- Ackerman, Ekers.
- Yeah.

90
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,620
Come on, Mac. Mr. McCord makes sure
the building doesn't burn down.

91
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,460
Go on through, Mr. Mac.
And who's this beauty?

92
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,700
This is my daughter Emily
and my son Tyler.

93
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,180
- Want a stamp?
- Love a stamp.

94
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,420
Hey, can you guys play
after we get in?

95
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,900
Hey, hold your horses.
I'm getting a stamp here.

96
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,300
I'll never wash
this hand again.

97
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,500
- See you later, Mr. Mac.
- Okay.

98
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,060
- Joan.
- Hi, Darren.

99
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,580
- Are you working tonight?
- After I take Tyler to the locker room.

100
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,460
Hey, could you give Emily
a look at Icey?

101
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,300
Icey always loves company. Come on,
Emily, I'm gonna show you where Icey is.

102
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,980
Icey. Big deal.
Some fat guy in a ratty penguin suit.

103
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,740
That blonde you're staring at,
she's the fat guy.

104
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,060
- What's he doing?
- Shaping the blade.

105
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,380
They're like horseshoes. You get 'em
hot enough, you can bend 'em.

106
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,300
You, uh, recognize him?

107
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,180
Yeah. Luc Robitaille.

108
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,900
He waved at me.
You see that, Dad?

109
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,860
Luc Robitaille waved at me.

110
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,220
Come on, I'll introduce you.
He won't bite.

111
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,900
- Luc, this is Tyler McCord
and his father Darren.
- Hi, Tyler. How are you?

112
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,820
- Ca va?
- Bonjour.

113
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,380
Dad, what did he say?

114
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,300
He thinks, uh, they're gonna win.

115
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,180
Hey, that's Brad Tolliver!

116
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,460
- Dad, he doesn't have a rocking chair.
- A what?

117
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,340
My dad said you should be sitting in
a rocking chair instead of on the ice.

118
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,540
- Oh, is that so?
- You play hockey, Tyler?

119
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,020
No, but my dad played.
He was a goalie.

120
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,620
A little semi-pro in Canada.
It was a long time ago.

121
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,580
Come by some afternoon.

122
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,260
I'll show you the difference between
the game you played and the one I play.

123
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,860
I'll show you the difference between
the game you played and the one I play.

124
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,780
I can see the difference.

125
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,260
I got this one, man.

126
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,980
Yes.

127
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,780
You boys have fun?

128
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,020
Luc Robitaille talked to me,
and we saw Brad Tolliver close up.

129
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,260
Your friends are gonna
be so jealous of you.

130
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,660
- I wanna go with Icey.
- So does Tyler.

131
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,540
Icey has to hit the stands, guys.
I'll see you later.

132
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,460
Bye-bye.

133
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,460
Andrew, this is Emily and Tyler.

134
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,580
Pleasure.

135
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,860
- Be right back.
- Come. I want to show you something.

136
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,100
Whoa! Cool!

137
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,740
That's why you won't hear
anyone complain about my cooking.

138
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,380
- At least not to my face.
- You got a burnt-out light bulb.

139
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,540
Could you change it?
I've got my hands full.

140
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,460
Sure.

141
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,020
Is that what Daddy does,
change light bulbs?

142
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,180
No, Emily.
He's just helping out.

143
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,580
- Firemen don't do that kind of stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

144
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,420
- Uh, nothing.
- When are we gonna sit down?

145
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,220
Frequent Flyer is in and on
his way to the locker room.

146
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,140
Keep him moving.

147
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,740
The Penguin fans are anxious
to see for the first time...

148
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,540
- the Penguins kicking the Stanley Cup...
- Do you have any cookies?

149
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,780
You force your way in here with a gun,
and now I have to feed you?

150
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,140
You don't have to.
But I still have the gun.

151
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,580
I think I have some Fig Newtons.

152
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,100
Hey! Caution.

153
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,220
Caution keeps you safe.

154
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,940
I keep my machine gun
in with the produce.

155
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,540
Okay, Veep's comin' in.
Let's get decent!

156
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Christ, Jefferson,
it's a locker room.

157
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,780
Duckerman, why don't you
put on a jock?

158
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,420
- Got any tape?
- You're covering the right head.

159
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,820
Let's go, let's go.

160
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,980
All right, guys, I'm privileged to
introduce Vice President Daniel Bender.

161
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,540
He's a big hockey fan
and he'd like to say a few words.

162
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,460
"A few words."
There's an optimist.

163
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,180
I want to wish you all
the best of luck and, uh,

164
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,380
are you Democrats
or Republicans?

165
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,580
Neither, sir. Canadians.

166
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,660
Well, in that case, good luck...

167
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,540
and I hope to toast
your championship after the game.

168
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,580
Sir, are you going to say the
same thing to the Blackhawks?

169
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,420
Of course.
Nice outfit, Duckerman.

170
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,940
Two nights ago with the Blackhawks
on the brink of elimination...

171
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,660
It's time!

172
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,380
I want you to pick up the phone...

173
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,300
and dial 555-1793.

174
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,380
- That's my husband's work number.
- It certainly is.

175
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,980
When you get him on the line,

176
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,900
- say only what's written on this.
- Ohh.

177
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,980
Kitchen. Yeah. Hold on.

178
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,900
Andrew, it's your wife.

179
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,540
- Hello?
- Andy, it...

180
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,300
We have your wife.
Follow her instructions.

181
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,020
They will not hurt me...

182
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,940
if you do as they say.

183
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,660
If you give any indication something
is wrong, they will... kill me.

184
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,220
When you go to the...
Vice President's box,

185
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,900
you will take two new
assistants with you...

186
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,060
escorted by
two security men.

187
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,660
Get them into the box.
That's all you need to do.

188
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,060
That's all you need to know.

189
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,780
Who are these men?
How will I know them?

190
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,660
In 30 seconds, you'll know.

191
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,140
I swear this.
If you hurt my wife, I'll...

192
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,500
You'll what?
Burn my toast?

193
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,860
- Mr. Ferrara?
- Yes?

194
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,460
Are these men yours?

195
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,060
Yes. They're mine.

196
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,220
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,260
The National Hockey League presents
game seven of the Stanley Cup finals.

198
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,900
The Chicago Blackhawks
and the Pittsburgh Penguins.

199
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,980
As we get ready for the seventh and
final game of the Stanley Cup finals,

200
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,420
you can feel the electricity in the air;
it sends a chill up your spine, Paul.

201
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,140
One of these clubs is going to
skate with Lord Stanley's cup
here at Civic Arena Ice tonight.

202
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,340
Listen to the crowd, Mike.
They're going crazy.

203
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,700
Well, here's to a great game.

204
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,380
Great if we win;
not so great if we lose.

205
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,020
We are ready.

206
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Thank you, everybody.
You may leave now.

207
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,060
Mr. Ferrara will close up
your stations.

208
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,540
...singing of our National Anthem.

209
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,380
Oh, say, can you see

210
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,580
# By the dawn's
early light

211
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,700
# What so proudly we hailed

212
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,860
# At the twilight's
last gleaming

213
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,420
- # Whose broad stripes
- What the hell are you...

214
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,980
# And bright stars

215
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,500
# Through the perilous fight

216
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,180
# O'er the ramparts
we watched

217
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,980
# Were so gallantly streaming

218
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,260
# And the rockets'
red glare

219
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,460
# The bombs bursting in air

220
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,140
# Gave proof
through the night

221
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,580
# That our flag
was still there

222
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,500
- I love that part.
- # Oh, say does that

223
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,060
- # Star-spangled
- Well, gotta go.

224
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:08,420
# Banner yet wave

225
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,220
# O'er the land

226
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,180
# Of the free

227
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,780
# And the home

228
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,180
# Of the brave

229
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,740
This place is going crazy right now.

230
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,580
You could not beg, borrow or
steal a ticket before the game tonight.

231
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
If you were packing heat,
you couldn't get in here.

232
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,180
Eddie Belfour
starts in goal for Chicago.

233
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,180
Amazingly, Brad Tolliver will play...

234
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,340
even though he could hardly walk today
much less skate with a fever of 104.

235
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,940
And here we go.
Game seven of the Stanley Cup finals.

236
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,580
And the Chicago Blackhawks
control the opening face-off.

237
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,940
They'll work into Pittsburgh territory,
putting pressure on the Penguins early.

238
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,060
Graham, slap shot!
Tolliver makes the save.

239
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,860
Please, he needs a doctor.

240
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,020
No!

241
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,940
Not any more. Go ahead.

242
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,180
Dead heroes get the best funerals.

243
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,860
Thanks for your help, Andrew.

244
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,060
His wife's recently deceased.
He would have been lonely without her.

245
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,180
I hope that clarifies
the urgency of this mission.

246
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,180
Only your best behavior's
gonna be good enough.

247
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,100
That agent's name was Eddie Caline.

248
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,460
He has a 5-year-old boy, a 3-year-old
little girl, and his wife's pregnant.

249
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,860
- I'll send a card.
- What do you want?

250
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,180
What do I want?

251
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,500
World peace, an end to bigotry
and no more mini-malls.

252
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,220
What am I gonna get?

253
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,220
And I am gonna get it.

254
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,660
That, boys and girls,
is really hot.

255
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,740
- What is your objective?
- My objective?

256
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,580
I get funny all over
when you talk like that.

257
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,460
I know what you're thinking.

258
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,180
Evaluate situation, calculate potential
losses and take appropriate action.

259
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,100
Let me do that for you.

260
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,620
The situation is hopeless.
The losses would be unacceptable.

261
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,900
The appropriate action is to do nothing
and keep your fucking mouth shut.

262
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,700
What kind of lunatic are you?

263
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,660
The best kind.

264
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,580
You can keep calling me names
if it makes you feel better.

265
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,740
Throw me your earpiece
and your mike.

266
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,300
Robitaille with a center pass.
That's just gonna miss.

267
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,780
We are still scoreless in game seven,
period one, the Hawks and Pens.

268
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,100
Watch Loeman.
He's got eyes in the back of his head.

269
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
They must be closed.

270
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,700
- Oh, gross!
- I have some work to do.

271
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,580
I'll be back before the period ends.
You two stay right here.

272
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,620
I'll go too,
so you'll have company.

273
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,260
Thanks, sweetheart,
but you stay with Tyler.

274
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,540
Now you won't be by yourself.

275
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,460
Thank you.

276
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,980
I mean it. Don't leave your seats.
Oh. In case you want a soda.

277
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,860
- Don't get out of your seats to get it.
- We get the idea, Dad.

278
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Hey, what's that?

279
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,860
Nothing.

280
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
What's Daddy gotta do?

281
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,460
Probably change more light bulbs.

282
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,020
You said firemen don't do
that kind of stuff.

283
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,460
Dad's not really
a fireman any more, Emily.

284
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,180
Now a steal by Stevens.
He walks into the Chicago end.

285
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,500
Slap shot!
He... shoots and scores!

286
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,540
Kevin Stevens gives the Penguins
the opening goal.

287
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,140
Get in the fast lane, Grandma.
The bingo game is ready to roll.

288
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,260
Hey!

289
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,660
He doesn't know whether
to cry or wind his watch.

290
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,820
Hey!

291
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,740
- The Penguins have scored.
- Hey!

292
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,660
That one came off Steve Smith, the
Chicago defenseman, and finds the net.

293
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,860
Pittsburgh goal,
his 11th in the play-offs...

294
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,860
scored by number 25,

295
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,620
Kevin Stevens!

296
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,620
Face-off at center ice.
Naslund of the Penguins controls.

297
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,500
He jumps into the Chicago end with the
Penguins leading 1-0 here in game seven.

298
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,740
Mike, as we expected,
the hitting has been ferocious.

299
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,620
Uh, if the smoke bothers anyone,
you just speak up.

300
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,260
There's no reason to kill anyone else.
Nobody's a threat to you.

301
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,460
You know, I voted for you.
I really did.

302
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,820
It's your sincerity
and your compassion.

303
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,900
You happen to be wrong, though. There
may be a reason to kill someone else.

304
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,300
There's bound to be
resistance to my "objective."

305
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,300
I assure you I won't kill
more people than it takes
to convince everyone of my sincerity.

306
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,220
Will you make that cow
stop moaning?

307
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,460
Just...

308
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,820
- What's that?
- An invitation to the White House.

309
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,180
Open it and read it.

310
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,020
Don't, don't, don't.

311
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,660
- Out loud.
- It's nothing but a bunch of numbers.

312
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,140
And they wonder why
this economy's so fucked up.

313
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,740
Those are the numbers of 13 accounts in
5 U.S. banks belonging to 3 countries...

314
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,540
that our government
has frozen for a variety of reasons.

315
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,260
They represent a total deposit of one
billion, seven hundred million dollars.

316
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,620
Christ, it runs in the family.

317
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,860
During the course of this game, all
that money is going to be released...

318
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,660
and transferred to banks
of my choice.

319
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,620
- That's impossible.
- At least one-third must be moved...

320
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,340
during each of the three
periods of the game.

321
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,500
lf, at the first period's end, deposits
are behind, one of you will die.

322
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,140
If we're still lagging at the end of
the second period, two of you will die.

323
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,740
And at the end of the third period
everyone in this building will die.

324
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,500
- You have no idea of the complexity...
- I had an idea.

325
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,700
I had this idea, and we are gonna
make it work or we're gonna die trying.

326
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,900
You will call the President,
and on flash precedence priority,

327
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,980
he will call the Secretary of State
and Secretary of the Treasury.

328
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,420
Then banks will be notified
and the money will begin to move.

329
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,300
Or it won't.

330
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,060
And if it doesn't,
when the game ends,

331
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,660
everyone in this box
and in this arena will die...

332
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,580
by explosion, fire and panic.

333
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,380
Enough bombs have been planted
in this building to stop all
the clocks in the hemisphere.

334
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,460
- You'll die with us.
- Could be.

335
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,420
I don't think anyone with manicured
fingernails and a $10,000 wristwatch...

336
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,180
- is planning on blowing himself up.
- $15,000 wristwatch.

337
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,300
I'm not sure if I like you.

338
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,500
When I make up my mind,
you'll be the first to know.

339
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,940
- You're out of your mind.
- Me? Ha!

340
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:16,260
I'm not the one paying some
Neanderthal 40 million dollars
to skate up and down the ice.

341
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,140
Call the White House.
You need the number?

342
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,620
Left wing pass
down to Steve Smith.

343
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,100
I've got every agent
converging on the arena,

344
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,580
and we'll all get the support
we need from local P.D.

345
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,500
The FBI won't be necessary.
He's our asset. We'll get him back.

346
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,700
Tell the President I'll keep him fully
informed until the Vice President's out.

347
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,780
There'll be a total
media blackout on this.

348
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,020
We'll inform all news outlets
of how serious this is.

349
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,220
Yes, sir. Absolutely. The place is
sealed off. No one can go in or out.

350
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,140
And...

351
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,580
We messed up a few times
since I've been an agent,

352
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,100
but how the fuck did we lose
the Vice President?

353
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,500
Right side, Weinrich fires.
Down the left side, Graham shoots!

354
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,100
Penguins trying to get it out.

355
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,300
The sound in this building
is absolutely deafening.

356
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,700
Shot picked up by Dubinsky.

357
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,700
Players are playing their guts out. It's
so loud, I can hardly hear myself think.

358
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,260
You don't have to think, Mike.
This is hockey.

359
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,100
The Hawks pressured now. Under 2 minutes
to go. Graham moves against Tolliver.

360
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,740
Fires and scores! The Chicago
Blackhawks have tied this game...

361
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,180
as Dirk Graham nailed it home,
his fourth of the play-offs.

362
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,980
And the Penguins and Hawks
are tied at one in game seven.

363
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,700
The Chicago goal,
his fourth of the play-offs...

364
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,140
They haven't moved a dime.

365
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,260
You know, I don't think
they believe you.

366
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,340
They're gonna sacrifice
a life to test my will.

367
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,180
I'm truly disappointed. Nobody does
anything these days because it's right.

368
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,300
They only do it if you make them.

369
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,060
Would you like to vote on who gets the
distinction of demonstrating my resolve?

370
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,300
You're not giving enough time. I told
you it couldn't be done that quickly.

371
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,660
Oh, you watch how much
they accomplish during the next period.

372
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,300
Now, would you all agree that
the mayor's wife's been most annoying?

373
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,820
Chicago again trying to make a move.

374
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,220
The Hawks attacking
the Penguin territory.

375
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,620
- An Orangeade.
- Coke or Sprite.

376
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,780
Sprite. No, Coke.

377
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,820
- Are you sure this time?
- One minute remaining
in the first period.

378
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,620
- "Sprite. No, Coke. No, Sprite."
- Shut up!

379
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,660
You're lucky Daddy's not here!

380
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,700
- Why, is there a light bulb
that needs changing?
- You take that back!

381
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,500
- Daddy's a fireman!
- He's too scared to be a fireman.

382
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,780
- He is not!
- Is too.
- I hate you.

383
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,700
Hey, Emily!
Dad said to stay here!

384
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,620
Hey, Emily!

385
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,980
Back in the right corner,
it'll be Steve Smith.

386
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,420
Smith out around center.
He lost the puck.

387
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,620
Robitaille back down
to Chicago territory.

388
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,740
Doesn't look too good.

389
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,580
Graham comes down the slot.
He's stopped by Tolliver.

390
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,980
Hey, Joan, going out
to entertain the Veep?

391
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,900
Mmm.

392
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,660
Are you okay?

393
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,380
He can't push it in.
He had a chance.

394
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,380
Ohh!

395
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,820
First period, shots on goal:
Chicago, 12;

396
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,820
Pittsburgh, 8.

397
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,740
Icey!

398
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,820
Say anything
and I'll kill your mother.

399
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,940
The official Stanley Cup album is
on sale at the Arena Concourse area.

400
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,980
Be sure to pick up your copy now.

401
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,620
- Where's Emily?
- She went to the bathroom.

402
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,860
I told you two not to move.

403
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,020
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

404
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,540
- She hit me and...
- You soaked her.

405
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,740
Don't move.

406
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,140
If the building is falling down
around you, you don't move!

407
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Emily!

408
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,740
It's a young wine.

409
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,940
Frisky. Huh.

410
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,180
It's almost impetuous,
wouldn't you say?

411
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,740
I can't think of any
punishment as severe...

412
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,820
as the one you deserve.

413
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,900
They didn't listen to me
and someone died. Call the President.

414
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,820
Tell him how much fun we're having.

415
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
I'm sorry. You're not cleared.

416
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,140
The owner just called me.
I'm Icey, the team mascot.

417
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,460
We're here to see
the Vice President.

418
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,380
- Who's this?
- The owner's niece.

419
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,780
Randy, we got clearance
on a Mr. Icey?

420
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,260
Randy?

421
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,380
- Randy.
- Mr. Icey's a woman, jerk-off.

422
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,780
Emily!

423
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,460
Fuck it.

424
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,580
You owe me a Mother's Day card.

425
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,780
- What is this, a day-care center?
- She saw me off a guy.

426
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,700
- Then you off her.
- I tried.

427
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,700
Touch her, you'll lose me as a hostage,
because you'll have to shoot me.

428
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,700
- Mr. Vice President.
- Aw, shut up. He's campaigning.

429
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,740
- Who are you here with?
- My daddy, and he's a boss.

430
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,940
And he's very brave
and he's not afraid.

431
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,580
And he's gonna come looking
for me, and you'll be sorry.

432
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,820
Oh, I'm already sorry.
What do you mean, he's a boss?

433
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,300
He's a head fireman
and he makes sure everybody's safe...

434
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,380
- and there's no fire.
- Who is this boss?

435
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,940
Uh, he must be a fire marshal.
When we have special events...

436
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,700
Yeah, yeah. Go and see if there's a
nervous father looking for his daughter.

437
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,300
- What is your name?
- Emily.

438
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,140
- Emily what?
- McCord.

439
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,980
- And your father's name?
- It's McCord too.

440
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,540
Would you like it if I filled
your little mouth with spiders?

441
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,700
- What's his whole name?
- Darren Francis Thomas McCord.

442
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,940
Thank you.
Let's find out who he is.

443
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,140
Thank you.
Let's find out who he is.

444
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,540
Ah!

445
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,300
Joan, I was trying
to catch up with you and Emily.

446
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,220
- She wasn't supposed to leave her seat.
- I'm Carla.

447
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,540
- Joan had to go home sick.
- But you were with...

448
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,940
my... my daughter Emily.

449
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,260
Yeah, she was lost.

450
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,060
So I took her up
to the owner's box.

451
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,180
Come on.
We'll go get her.

452
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,980
Ow!

453
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,340
Aah!

454
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,060
Aah!

455
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,820
Aah!

456
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,100
Second period action about to begin.
The Penguins and Hawks tied at one.

457
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,380
Penguins have the face-off.
Francis deals it up to the Chicago end.

458
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,980
Jagr will chase it down.
He pops it up.

459
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,700
The pass is out to the Penguins.

460
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,100
You've got to get the cops.

461
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,100
My daughter's missing,
and someone just tried to kill me.

462
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,660
Show me where this happened.

463
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,740
May I help you?

464
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,060
This is Matthew Hallmark, Secret
Service. Put the Vice President on.

465
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,660
Hallmark?

466
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,300
Well, I see they care enough
to send their very best.

467
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,940
Gee, I never heard
that one before.

468
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,260
- Say hello.
- This is Vice President Bender. I...

469
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,780
- Now you talk to me.
- Who are you?

470
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,700
- Is that necessary?
- Yes.

471
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,500
I'm a disillusioned patriot with a yen
to fulfill my personal ambitions.

472
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,260
- All right. How many are dead?
- Counting Secret Service?

473
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,580
By the way, why do you tell everybody
you're Secret Service agents?

474
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,220
If it's supposed to be
a secret, don't tell anyone.

475
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,700
How many are dead?

476
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,860
One civilian, but the room
is full of candidates.

477
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,380
- Don't kill anyone else, you hear me?
- You were told the parameters.

478
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,940
Full transfer of funds
by the end of this game.

479
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,980
No attempt to storm this box;
no attempt to clear the arena.

480
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,540
No helicopters or police vehicles
encroach on the stadium grounds.

481
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,220
- Your demands are unrealistic.
- I'm a positive thinker, Matty.

482
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,380
We know you've already checked on these
accounts, so the wheels are turning.

483
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,220
Oh, by the way, don't make any transfers
to the Bently-owned banks.

484
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,060
As shocking as it may be,
they're CIA fronts.

485
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,380
You were with one of our agencies.

486
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,220
You're wasting some of that
unrealistic timetable.

487
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,340
Did he sound like he'd do it?
Kill the Vice President and everybody?

488
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,180
It sounds like he knows way too much.

489
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,180
Chelios, right side,
wide open to the net.

490
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,220
Tolliver! A great save there from
right in front on Dubinsky.

491
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,180
And back come the Pittsburgh Penguins.

492
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,020
Hawgood's got a man, Robitaille,
but he can't connect on the pass.

493
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,740
Hawgood's got a man, Robitaille,
but he can't connect on the pass.

494
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,220
So, where's this seven-foot penguin?

495
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,860
She was there.
I wanna go up to the owner's box.

496
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,780
There's a VIP in the box,
and you don't have clearance.

497
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,220
- Neither does my daughter.
- Who knows where she is?

498
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,620
Let's page her over the public address.
Maybe she's just lost.

499
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,580
Oh, I made this up?
The penguin had a gun.

500
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,140
We'll page it too.

501
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,820
You said her name
was Carla, didn't you?

502
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,300
I always do things like that.

503
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,860
- You didn't say the name, did you?
- No.

504
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,580
Aah!

505
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,900
- What the fuck is going on?
- Fuck you. And fuck your kid.

506
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,740
- Where is she?
- I-I don't know.

507
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,020
- Is she in the owner's box?
- Maybe. Maybe she went out to dinner.

508
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,140
In a minute, that ear will come off.

509
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,140
All right! All right!

510
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,420
All right! We took the box.

511
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,340
We got people everywhere.

512
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,300
The whole joint's rigged with bombs.

513
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,380
We could bring the whole building down.

514
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,620
What are you, terrorists?

515
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,780
I'm no fucking terrorist.
I'm a professional!

516
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,140
- How do I get in the box?
- Oh, you don't.

517
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,580
Not if you want to see that kid alive.

518
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,300
Aah!

519
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,100
Game's tied at one. Chicago
puts the pressure on the Penguins.

520
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,020
Here's Shantz around the net.
He knocks it right in.

521
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,740
Chicago has taken the lead
against the Penguins.

522
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,580
- Jeff Shantz, the goal scorer.
- This crowd is unhappy,
but give the Hawks credit.

523
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,620
Joe Murphy helping the play,
the Chicago center ice man.

524
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,740
Joan.

525
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,220
Murphy backhanded it off the right wing
boards, and ahead it goes...

526
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,980
into Chicago ice.

527
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,340
Cam Russell wearing number eight
in a bright red Chicago uniform.

528
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,700
For Chicago, every step,
every rush is so important.

529
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,300
911, emergency services.

530
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,140
- Officer Lyons speaking.
- My name is Darren McCord.

531
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,980
I'm calling you
from the Civic Arena. 555-1923.

532
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,900
This is not a crank call.

533
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,140
The Vice President is being held hostage
in the owner's box.

534
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,980
- They've got my daughter too.
- This is Sergeant Kurtz.

535
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,220
- Where are you calling from?
- The executive offices.

536
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,060
Stay there for 90 seconds
and keep the line clear.

537
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
The Hawks got a man wide open.

538
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,300
He's a step behind the defense.
Here he comes. His shot.

539
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,220
Diving to make the save.

540
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,300
Yeah?

541
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,420
McCord? Hallmark, Secret Service.
What's your situation?

542
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,980
- Lousy. How long have you
known what's going on here?
- Assume we don't.

543
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,180
Someone is holding the owner's box
and everybody in it, including my kid.

544
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,460
- What else?
- Did you have agents posted
at a private elevator?

545
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,580
- Two.
- Notify their families.

546
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,820
- Had any contact with the aggressors?
- I killed two. Is that contact?

547
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,100
Look, one of them told me they're going
to bring this whole building down.

548
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,100
- What are you gonna do?
- We're evaluating the situation.

549
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,420
There's no situation! They want money,
a lot of it. Give it to them.

550
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,740
If you fuck around
and something happens to my kid...

551
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,980
We're considering
every possible response.

552
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,060
If you're not gonna pay,
I'll get my daughter.

553
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,620
Do not try any kind of rescue.
Do you understand me?

554
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,660
You will jeopardize the Vice President
and everyone else in the arena.

555
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,380
Believe me, we know
what the hell we're doing.

556
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,740
Our agents are entering the arena.

557
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,780
You stay where you are.
We're gonna do this by the numbers.

558
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,700
- What number was that, three?
- What I said goes. Don't do anything.

559
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,860
They've turned this whole place
into one big bomb. Do you understand?

560
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,740
- We have bomb squads.
- They don't do us any good out there.

561
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,100
- I'll find the bombs myself.
- You can't do anything alone!

562
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,020
I'm not alone.

563
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,740
Watching them operate
doesn't give one much hope, does it?

564
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,420
I'm comfortable with whatever strategy
they deem appropriate.

565
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,020
Strategy? Shit.
They fucked up!

566
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,420
Two men should have been
stationed in that kitchen,

567
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,500
one with a clean geometrical line of
fire to every square inch of the room.

568
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,340
Every body and every thing going into
that elevator should have been searched.

569
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,180
And no covered tray should have been
allowed up here without inspection.

570
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,460
How long were you in the service?

571
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,420
I still am.

572
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,300
- This is my vacation.
- Counterfeit section.

573
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,220
Money's good.
You just can't spend it.

574
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,060
Money's good.
You just can't spend it.

575
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,900
We have confirmation.
One thousand meters.

576
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,780
One thousand meters, roger.

577
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,100
Five hundred meters and closing.

578
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,460
Tango Alpha,
going to start deployment.

579
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,140
Sierra Poppa, deploying one.

580
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,300
Deploying two.

581
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,940
Uh, what's your rate
of deployment there?

582
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,820
Roger.

583
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,740
Three hundred feet.

584
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,380
Three hundred feet.
Copy.

585
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,300
Two hundred feet.

586
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,060
Break off!
Break off!

587
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,140
Man down!

588
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,900
This is Hallmark.

589
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,220
I said no vehicles on the grounds,
no helicopters in the air...

590
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,140
and no agents
in the building.

591
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,860
What part of that
did you not understand?

592
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,060
Three cars are closing on the building
that missile came from.

593
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,300
Ground the other choppers.
I don't want to take this guy alive.

594
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,700
Penguins slip it back
behind the Chicago goal.

595
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,780
He shoots and scores!

596
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,740
Sandstrom and the Penguins
have tied it at two.

597
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,540
Oh, scratch my back
with a hacksaw!

598
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,020
Hey!

599
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,820
The Pittsburgh goal,
fourth of the play-offs...

600
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:07,020
scored by number 17,
Tomas Sandstrom!

601
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,180
The cavalry's coming.

602
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,140
Custer was in the cavalry.
Let 'em come.

603
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,700
- Command, access acquired.
- Roger, copy.

604
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,780
Second team going.
Now.

605
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,660
Motorola MX 360, encryption
and frequency-hopping capability.

606
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,220
Right out of the company store.
You talk, we listen.

607
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,140
Four at the
east side entrance.

608
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,220
We got a light blazer, maybe a tan
windbreaker with a black baseball cap.

609
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,500
A dark yet tasteful windbreaker...

610
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,180
and, uh, a Penguin jacket
and dark pants.

611
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,380
We pay these idiots to protect you,
and they're trying to get you killed.

612
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,020
As a taxpayer, I don't think
you're getting our money's worth.

613
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,860
If those guys want to see a hockey game
so much, we should put them on ice.

614
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,020
We're giving it five minutes.
If they don't report, we're moving in.

615
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,860
That's the President's choice,
but I think it's the wrong one.

616
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,660
- Unless I get a direct order,
I'm getting those guys out.
- Sir?

617
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,540
- What?
- I think you oughta see this.

618
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,900
Stay back!

619
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,220
- Jesus Christ.
- Get 'em out of here.

620
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,900
Penguins gun out of their
own end at the center ice.

621
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,900
They work it down the right.
Murphy has it and he gave it away.

622
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,980
Here's Mullen. It goes wide
off the glove of Eddie Belfour.

623
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,300
John Cullen going
behind the Chicago net.

624
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,660
This guy could prove
to be a pain in the ass.

625
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,580
He has heroic tendencies.

626
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,300
Don't get so worked up.
They'll win.

627
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,780
We've got four minutes left
in period number two.

628
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,420
Centered in the Chicago zone.

629
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,540
Mullen passes to Larry Murphy.

630
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,740
Murphy backhands it
off the right wing boards.

631
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,180
Belfour keeps the play alive.

632
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,220
No, don't!
Oh, don't do it!

633
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,660
This place is ready to explode.

634
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,860
The last seconds of play.

635
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,020
Don't!

636
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,220
- You just killed two
useful members of society.
- No! It's being done!

637
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,140
- The time ticking down here.
- Maybe you'll do better
in the third period.

638
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,860
- They're moving some.
- They're way behind.

639
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,780
I said one-third at the end
of the first period, one-third
at the end of the second period.

640
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,660
- Two seconds left.
- I don't see anything
even close to that.

641
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,780
No!

642
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,140
Second period shots on goal:
Chicago, seven; Pittsburgh...

643
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,180
The mayor has decided not
to run for reelection.

644
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,940
Now, for my
second selection,

645
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,980
I... think...

646
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,180
- Um.
- No, please!

647
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,460
They're moving more.

648
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,620
But it's not that much.

649
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,620
Listen to me, goddam it!
You're getting it!

650
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,820
Kids, don't try this at home.

651
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,060
- Yeah?
- I've got a message for the board.

652
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,380
Maybe you haven't heard.
A guy named Bell invented the telephone.

653
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,780
- Come on, it's been dead all day.
- Which one controls the billboard?

654
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,700
I can't let you do that.

655
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,620
I'm having a real bad day.

656
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,460
You're assuming his detonators
are radio-controlled.

657
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,580
We get someone inside with equipment
to jam all frequencies...

658
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,340
Damn.

659
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,260
- C-4. I hope he's wrong.
- Not likely.

660
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,140
Arson investigator,
lots of commendations.

661
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,980
- Problem is...
- Is what, sir?

662
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,380
He was taken off-line.
He's a head case.

663
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,700
Shit.

664
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,020
Here we go, final period
of the Stanley Cup finals!

665
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,580
The Chicago Blackhawks
control the opening face-off.

666
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:57,500
They'll work it to Pittsburgh territory,
putting pressure on the Penguins early.

667
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,540
Sir, I have strong reservations
about you going alone.

668
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,420
There's no way to deploy
any number of men and get close.

669
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,260
- Nobody else is coming out dead!
- How you gonna get there?

670
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,140
Walk. One solitary man
shouldn't trigger a deadly response.

671
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,700
If it does, tell my ex-wife
her gravy train went off the tracks.

672
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:44,180
This is the most powerful
plastic explosive in the world.

673
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,660
- Don't be too quick
to pull the trigger.
- Save it. I placed that stuff.

674
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,300
No detonator, no "ka-boom."

675
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,980
- Everybody's an expert.
- Bye-bye.

676
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,340
Aaah!

677
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,380
Bye-bye.

678
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:11,500
This is the most powerful
plastic explosive in the world.

679
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:18,660
- Do you believe me about the explosives?
- Afraid not.

680
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,020
You're McCord. I'm Hallmark.

681
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,940
Have any I.D?

682
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,780
I didn't kill you.

683
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,340
That's for doing your job half-assed...

684
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,220
and putting
my daughter's life in danger.

685
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,140
- And the Vice President's.
- How'd you happen to come down here?

686
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,060
I saw these two and followed them.

687
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,100
Part of my job is recognizing
who's out of place and who isn't.

688
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,260
They didn't seem
interested in hockey.

689
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,420
- How'd you kill that guy?
- Magic. I think there's more
setups like this.

690
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,100
- You know where they are?
- I made some educated guesses.

691
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,020
These are the points I'd pop
if I wanted to bring this place down.

692
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:57,820
- You marked 15 or 20.
- The places that would cause
the most structural damage.

693
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,180
Third period's started. We got less
than 20 minutes and we're guessing.

694
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,580
Let's hope I know what I'm doing.

695
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,380
Oh. Listen.
My son is here too.

696
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,820
If I can't get back to him,
he's sitting in D-10.

697
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,660
I'll be there.

698
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,620
- Thanks.
- Where are the rest of your men?

699
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,260
From the Chicago end,
McEachern centers.

700
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,540
Belfour made the stop.
Straka with a quick shot.

701
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,700
Just missed the far post.

702
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,620
- Now they're moving it.
- Yeah, but where? Check the codes.

703
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,500
Four hundred million to
Banco de Vizcaya, Madrid.

704
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,420
That's one of the counter banks.

705
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,300
And 300 million
to Banco Popular, Virgin Islands.

706
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,980
These transfers are being tracked;
you'll never get the money.

707
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,700
Not all of it. The money
will be transferred to 12 more banks.

708
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,900
I have arrangements with
the presidents of two.

709
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:55,100
Once it's transferred, it's transferred
again and again in a matter of minutes.

710
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,180
With each stop,
cash is siphoned and rerouted,

711
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,300
some converted to foreign currency,

712
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,980
some to negotiable instruments.

713
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,860
Thanks to the incredibly vast
and complicated world of banking...

714
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,060
that our CIA uses to such advantage,

715
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:13,540
about 500 million dollars will be lost,
absorbed by the system.

716
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,380
And the other billion,
200 million is just a diversion.

717
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:20,100
I only wanted enough to
pay off my American Express.

718
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,500
You wouldn't be so generous
with that information...

719
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,380
if you weren't planning
to kill everyone here.

720
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:30,900
Who gets the Cup if I blow up
the building before the game is over?

721
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,660
Yeah?

722
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,260
Not on the phone. You know
they've got the frequency by now.

723
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,780
Don't go away.

724
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:55,220
Taken away, and McEachern
hustling down the right side.

725
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:59,340
Coming into the Chicago end. Moves in to
the net. A backhand shot, off-target.

726
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,180
McCord's disarming your bombs.

727
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,020
- Is he guessing?
- He's a pretty good guesser.

728
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,940
- Is he alone?
- Yeah.

729
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:27,820
- Why didn't you kill him?
- Two of your goons started
firing at us. He ran off.

730
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:32,300
- It was all I could do to keep
from getting my own ass shot.
- I want him.

731
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,180
I would've had him if you had
more control over your men.

732
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,940
The only problem my men had is they
didn't hit what they were shooting at.

733
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:41,820
Look, I was there too.

734
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,860
Nice.

735
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:49,420
I got the next best thing
to the fireman.

736
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,260
He's got a little boy here in the arena.
I know where he's sitting.

737
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,460
Bring him to me.

738
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,820
I always wanted a son.

739
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:05,020
Greg Smyth against Robitaille,
and zoom!

740
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:09,740
Quick shot, save made! Hawgood trying
to tee it up. Stopped by Tolliver.

741
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,580
- Tyler?
- Yeah?

742
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,820
Pretty exciting game, huh?

743
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:22,660
- How come you know my name?
- Your dad and I are friends.
He asked me to come get you.

744
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:27,340
He and your sister got invited to sit
in the owner's box, way up there.

745
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,220
They got big soft chairs
and plenty to eat.

746
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,060
My dad told me to stay here,
even if the building fell down.

747
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,940
If it did come down,
up there is where you'd wanna be.

748
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,140
Come on.

749
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,180
I'm gonna stay here.

750
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,300
I'm gonna be embarrassed
going back without you.

751
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:50,820
- Do you know my mom?
- No, but your dad's invited me
over for dinner tomorrow.

752
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,740
My mom and dad don't live together.

753
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,620
He didn't mention that.
He just said bring you upstairs.

754
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:59,940
- Don't you think you should
do what you're told?
- I am.

755
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,700
I need you to come with me.
I'm with the Secret Service.

756
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:08,460
- Come with me now.
- Come on! Down in front!

757
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:13,500
- I'll scream.
- I said, I'm with the Secret Service.

758
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:17,660
- And I'm a little kid.
- Hey, fella, I didn't pay to watch you!

759
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,580
Down in front!

760
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,740
Steve Smith finds the lane.
He'll skate ahead.

761
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,460
Coming to the Penguin line.

762
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,220
How many'd you get?

763
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,300
Four, so far.

764
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,180
- Is that all?
- Christ, I'm just one guy.

765
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,060
- How many did you get?
- Just one.

766
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:22,980
You are all alone, aren't you?

767
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:31,900
- You must be real proud.
- I'm gonna be real rich.

768
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:34,300
Now, very slowly...
I mean very slowly...

769
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,180
pull your hands
out of your pockets.

770
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:47,300
- What are you gonna do, drown me?
- No.

771
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,660
Aaaah!

772
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,180
- Yeah?
- Hallmark's dead.

773
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:18,140
- Who's this?
- Tom Castillo, Secret Service.

774
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,020
Tom Castillo.
How you doin', Tom?

775
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,540
- I hope you were gentle with Hallmark.
- How many hostages,

776
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,940
besides the Vice President,
are still alive?

777
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,300
That's a personal question.
Ever been involved in an A.O.P., Tom?

778
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:33,580
I didn't call for conversation.
How many are still alive?

779
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:37,420
You'd probably think I was lying,
no matter what I told you,

780
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,260
so I'm gonna let you talk
to a little friend of mine.

781
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,540
Hello?

782
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,580
- Hello?
- Emily.

783
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,100
Don't let him know it's me. I'll get
you out. I'll take you home, I promise.

784
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:55,940
Look around and tell me
how many people are there.

785
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,020
Twelve.

786
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,900
Well, now, wasn't that sweet?

787
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,420
She included me, Tom.

788
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:09,860
Tell me what an A.O.P. is, or I'm gonna
shoot this cute little pumpkin.

789
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,060
Listen to me. Listen good.

790
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,100
If you touch her,
you look at her cross-eyed, you lose.

791
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,540
How do you figure that, fireman?

792
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:21,420
Okay, here's the game
and here are the rules.

793
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:24,580
You've got your hostages and your bombs,
so you can get your money.

794
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:28,420
I'm gonna try to stop you,
but I don't want anyone to get hurt.

795
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,380
You stop me, you win.
I get your bombs, I win.

796
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,260
You stop me, you win.
I get your bombs, I win.

797
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,460
That's the game,
you piece of shit.

798
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:37,220
If you touch her, the game's off.
Then I'll come after you.

799
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:41,420
You'll have to kill me in front of every
body in this arena. There will be panic.

800
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:45,060
The Secret Service, S.W.A.T., the
fucking navy will have to come in here.

801
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:47,940
Then you don't get your money.
You lose, pal.

802
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,820
Well, that's not bad
for a civil servant.

803
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,700
Oh, by the way,
in the Secret Service,

804
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,380
A.O.P. is "assault on principle."

805
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,180
- In this case, our Vice President.
- I don't give a shit.

806
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:02,940
Ooh, now, Tom, come on. If we're
gonna play, you got to play nice.

807
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:07,780
You run your ass off. I know where the
bombs are, so I know where you're going.

808
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,820
Then come and get me.

809
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,380
Would you like
a glass of wine or a cigarette?

810
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:20,140
It's customary to offer these
minor vices to someone before they die.

811
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:32,580
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Sure you are.

812
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:36,100
- I'm the scariest person you've seen.
- You're the meanest.

813
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,980
Am I, now?
How do you suppose I got that way?

814
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:43,780
Maybe when you were born
you had something wrong with your brain.

815
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,420
Don't you know any little boys like me?

816
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,460
If there were any at my school,
they'd get expelled.

817
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,740
I can assure you there are one or two.

818
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:58,340
I'm gonna kill your daddy.
What do you think about that?

819
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:02,140
He promised he'd take me home.
He always does what he says.

820
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,740
So do I.

821
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:15,300
We're in the third period.
The Penguins on the rush.

822
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,540
Tamer brings it in.

823
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:21,060
He puts it in!
Ron Francis!

824
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:25,700
Oh, buy Sam a drink
and get his dog one too!

825
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,140
Chicago desperate to get
back into this game.

826
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:55,460
Sutter fires and scores!
Chicago does get the third goal!

827
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:59,300
I tell ya, Mike, I don't think
Tolliver looks like himself right now.

828
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:02,540
We shouldn't be surprised. He had
a 104 degree temperature earlier today.

829
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,860
He looks like he's struggling
in that goal for the Penguin.

830
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,260
- Yo, Ref.
- He's calling for the referee.

831
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,580
- He might wanna go to the bench.
- Tolliver is gonna head that way.

832
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:15,460
- Backup for the Penguins is Ken Wregget.
- What's the matter?

833
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:19,340
I really feel like shit.
I don't think I can goal.

834
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,940
Go to the locker room. Wregget!

835
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,300
- Get in there.
- Let's go, Kenny.

836
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,780
Now in goal for Pittsburgh,
number 31, Ken Wregget.

837
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,780
Hey, fireman, where are you?

838
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:47,780
- You don't call, you don't write.
- I'm not far away.

839
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,300
- How many have you found?
- How many what?

840
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,220
I could detonate all ten right now.

841
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:56,100
Go ahead. Then you lose.

842
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:02,300
Nervous stomach, fireman?

843
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,300
He's at number seven.
Get somebody there.

844
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,140
Charge!

845
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:20,260
Roberts cannot get it out.
Chelios in deep. A shot off the stick!

846
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,340
Section B. Now.

847
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:47,140
Chelios guns it ahead
to Bernie Nicholls.

848
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:49,700
Here he comes!
Look out!

849
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:54,140
He shoots and scores! Bernie Nicholls
carried it in, right down the slot.

850
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,780
A heavy slap shot.

851
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:07,940
An old-fashioned shoot-out here
at the Stanley Cup competition.

852
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,460
Up the alley now,
center circle.

853
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,860
Lines it up to the Penguins.

854
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:34,260
He'll get the puck out.
He really shakes his stick.

855
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:38,100
Mike, they're making some noise
down here and I'm not sure why.

856
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:42,380
I don't believe this. Brad Tolliver
is actually coming back into the game!

857
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:45,740
This is a guy that once
finished a game with a broken ankle.

858
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:55,100
Takes a lot of guts to come back in
at this point with Chicago leading, 4-3.

859
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:58,820
They're on the verge of winning
their first Stanley Cup since 1960.

860
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,220
Now he's just sitting on the bench.

861
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,860
Feeling better?

862
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,300
Then get the fuck in there.

863
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,500
And here he comes.

864
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,980
Now back in goal for Pittsburgh,

865
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:23,780
number 35, Brad Tolliver,
replacing number 31, Ken Wregget.

866
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:28,340
I don't know what he did, if he
just recharged his battery or what,

867
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:32,700
but this guy was really sick
and he's gonna try to finish the game.

868
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:37,180
Can he can make the big saves to keep
the Penguins within striking distance?

869
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:40,100
He's got all summer to get better.

870
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:43,740
There's Tolliver, with the crowd
here literally crazy on their feet.

871
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:47,580
Penguins looking for a lift here
to try and get back in this game.

872
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:50,660
Here we go!
Chicago will control the face-off.

873
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,380
- They'll dump it to the Penguin end.
- Stay down there.

874
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:58,900
- Oh, Christ.
- Chicago drives it back
into Pittsburgh territory.

875
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:02,500
Chicago slips it back
behind the Pittsburgh goal.

876
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:06,500
The Penguins try to get the puck back,
and they do just that.

877
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,900
They scramble now
and deliver up the right side.

878
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:13,820
They have to stay on offense. Tolliver
is not challenging the shooters.

879
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,820
- He hasn't challenged much all night.
- Oh, shit.

880
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,660
Move out!

881
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,540
Move out!

882
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,100
Goddam it, move out!

883
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,340
He's gonna come out.
He'll challenge.

884
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:35,060
Tolliver hits his head on the ice,
and he's hurt, but play continues.

885
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,860
The puck gets free.
The Penguins have command.

886
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:42,340
The Penguins trail by only one.

887
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,420
Tolliver hit his head on the ice
so hard his kids will be born dizzy.

888
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:58,900
This is Chicago on the attack.

889
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:31,620
What a save by Brad Tolliver!
That's the save of the year!

890
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:34,580
He oughta get five to ten
for robbing the Hawks on that...

891
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,980
to keep the Penguins within a goal.

892
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,180
Not to mention, Paul,
that he's been sick.

893
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,980
He didn't challenge much this game. Now
he comes up with the save of the year.

894
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:48,340
No question about it,
that is his biggest save ever.

895
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,780
- He makes a move in front of the net.
- What's he doing?

896
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:21,060
- He just slammed Dubinsky!
- Tolliver, what the fuck are you doing?

897
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,060
He gave him a right cross
and knocked him down.

898
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:27,620
He's gonna get
a game misconduct and a fine.

899
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:30,540
He's put his team shorthanded.
The Penguins now are really in the hole.

900
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,740
Strange night for Tolliver.
I don't know what he's up to.

901
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:39,500
Tolliver, that's
a thousand-dollar fine!

902
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:54,340
Get outta the way!

903
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,900
Who the hell are you?

904
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,820
What the hell...

905
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,020
Aaah!

906
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:20,100
Ysebaert will rebound.
He'll turn and shoot.

907
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:25,380
Less than three minutes to go. He'll
have to find the puck. And he does.

908
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,140
Face-off.
Off the puck he goes!

909
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,980
Chicago has it back again with two
minutes to go in third-period action.

910
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:38,060
On the move. The Blackhawks
stopped by the Penguins' line.

911
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,860
The Penguins desperately
trying to get back and tie.

912
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:53,380
The Chicago Blackhawks
hold on to a 4-3 lead.

913
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:57,220
Penguins have to look for a big gun
to try and topple Chicago again.

914
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,620
Just moments away, they're gonna pack up
the Stanley Cup and take it to Chicago.

915
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:01,980
Just moments away, they're gonna pack up
the Stanley Cup and take it to Chicago.

916
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,140
Intercepted by Chicago!

917
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:18,420
Big check on
John Cullen of the Penguins.

918
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:30,340
Jagr going for the net, Naslund shoots,
and he's stopped by Belfour.

919
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,260
A minute, thirty-five to go
in the third period.

920
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,420
That's all that remains
for Chicago to win the Stanley Cup.

921
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,340
The Penguins need a rally
to tie the game.

922
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,780
Penguins reach in the corner.

923
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:52,180
Drop it.

924
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:10,500
Oh, what a save!

925
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:14,780
Larmer drills one! Nice stop! He gave
more moves than Mae West on that one!

926
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:18,540
One minute remaining
in the third period.

927
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:22,180
And the Penguins
trailing by a goal.

928
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:24,740
Chicago still
putting pressure on.

929
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:30,140
Forty seconds remaining now.

930
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:33,500
Aaah!

931
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:37,460
The Penguins
need a goal desperately.

932
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,140
Thirty seconds left. Chicago's looking
for the parade down Michigan Ave.

933
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,300
They feel they've got
the Stanley Cup.

934
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,500
Aaah!

935
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:01,100
Aaah!

936
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:03,020
...Chicago win the Stanley Cup.

937
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:06,020
Time again ticking down.
Penguins running out of it.

938
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:11,620
Penguins reaching for every
possible thing they have.

939
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:15,460
Chicago takes it away. They'll drive
it to center with 14 seconds to go.

940
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,860
The Penguins don't have much time!

941
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:20,860
The puck's run by Francis,
ahead to Robitaille.

942
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:23,540
Not much time to go. Luc Robitaille...

943
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:33,220
We've got eight seconds left!

944
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,500
Seconds to go.

945
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,980
Stop the press!
Stop the press!

946
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,900
The Penguins have tied the game.

947
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:05,220
We're going to sudden death overtime!
You would have to be here to believe it!

948
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:10,180
Lucky Luc has scored for the Penguins
with under a second to go!

949
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:18,540
This series has been incredible!

950
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:21,340
- Lucky Luc has done it again!
- Sudden death?

951
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:23,620
Sudden death.

952
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:27,340
Paul, the Penguins
would not give up, despite the odds.

953
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:31,740
Belfour tried everything
in his power to stop them.

954
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:35,580
The Penguins have forced
sudden death overtime.

955
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:39,940
The team that scores first in the
next period will win the Stanley Cup!

956
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:42,340
Pittsburgh goal,

957
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:45,500
his 14th in the play-offs,
scored by...

958
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:48,380
Life's just a shitbox
of ironies, huh?

959
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,460
We still got money to move.
I hope it's not mine.

960
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,380
Everybody's got
a little more time.

961
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,300
I'd hate to see them waste it.

962
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,220
Wouldn't you?

963
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:36,540
Throw away the clocks, because the next
goal is going to win the Stanley Cup.

964
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,460
That's what sudden death
is all about.

965
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,300
Penguins control the draw,
drop it into the Chicago end.

966
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,220
Jagr will carry it in.

967
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:03,900
Both net-minders coming up tough here.
McEachern has it again!

968
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,820
Psst.

969
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,540
Aah!

970
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:24,220
Aaaah!

971
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,940
Breaking quickly!
Got a man! Move!

972
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:32,340
Bang! I'm immortal.

973
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,500
Aah!

974
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,620
Aaaah!

975
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:49,260
Jagr will carry it in,
but he's checked.

976
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,820
Aaaah!

977
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,660
Holy shit!

978
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:18,060
What's that?

979
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:00,380
Daddy!

980
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,620
Daddy.

981
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,380
- Come on, let's go!
- Watch it, will ya?

982
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,260
How many did you find, fireman?

983
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:55,500
Tyler.

984
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:01,060
I didn't move, Dad.
I didn't move.

985
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:03,100
Not even when things
blew up.

986
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,300
I didn't move.

987
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:13,460
It's over.

988
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:21,460
You're McCord, right?
I'm Agent Saccio.

989
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,340
Better off not moving
until this settles down.

990
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:28,180
The Vice President wants very much
to meet you. He's very grateful.

991
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,660
Daddy. Daddy.

992
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,740
Daddy, that's the man.

993
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:38,180
That's the man, Daddy.
That's him.

994
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,580
Daddy!

995
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,180
Stay with him.

996
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,140
Emily!

997
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,060
Daddy!

998
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:17,900
Let's go.

999
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:32,100
Daddy!

1000
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,620
Daddy!

1001
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:54,500
No!

1002
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:56,420
Aaah! Daddy!

1003
01:37:57,860 --> 01:38:00,100
Daddy!

1004
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:37,660
I'm not gonna kill you!

1005
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:41,500
I'd rather you spent the rest
of your life remembering you
couldn't save your little girl.

1006
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:47,780
Daddy!

1007
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,620
Aah!

1008
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,180
Aaah!

1009
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,820
Aah!

1010
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,540
Aaah!

1011
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:06,300
Aaah!

1012
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:22,340
Aaaah!

1013
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:22,300
You should've seen my dad.

1014
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:26,300
My daddy's a fireman.
