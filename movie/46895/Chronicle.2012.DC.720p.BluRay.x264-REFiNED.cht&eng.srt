I mean, I'm not saying thatyou're not now. I'm just-

394

你真是個混蛋
[ Scoffs ]You're such an asshole.

395

我就是這個意思 你不友善 懂嗎?
That's what I'm talking about, dude.You're hostile, see?

What, with this?

401
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,158
沒怎麼想過
Not really.

402
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,457
怎麼? 還有什麼能做的?
Why? What else is there?

鈥淭he ability to move, lift, vibrate鈥?

405

411

安德魯
[ Matt ] Andrew. [Whistles ]

412
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,940
她今天穿黑的
[All Laughing] [ Steve ]She's wearing black today.

414
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,693
- ...在我房間裡- 聽著
...Week, in my room.Just listen.

415

我變得越來越強 昨晚我甚至把床抬了起來
I'm just that much stronger.Even last night I got my whole bed off the ground.

No nosebleed. Yeah?I've been lifting weights too.

417
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,374
我的理論是 這能力像是條肌肉
This is my theory thoughis that it's like a muscle.

418
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,298
它有伸縮性如果一次張得太多太快 它會斷
Like, it's elastic. If you stretchit too far, too quick, it'll tear.

419
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,875
額
Ew.

420
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,377
這就是為什麼我們漸漸變強...
That's why I think we'regetting stronger, you know,

421
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,090
因為我們在訓練它 變得更壯

這個當訓練怎麼樣?
How about this for a workout?

424
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,312

就像我說的 看吧媽呀
Like I said. See?Holy crap.

455

[ Steve] Man! Just pretend that there's abarrier over your hand, right? And then-

456
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,193

457
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,237
- 你就有屏障保護 不會受到傷害- 這太正了
they will not hurt you because of the barrier.[ Matt] That's so sick.

458
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,612
那個我喜歡史蒂夫，史蒂夫，你得試試這個
[Steve] That's me right there. I need that.Steve, Steve, you have to try this, dude.

459
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,163
把手給我
Give me your hand.

460
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:54,290
當我還是小孩子的時候，我其實。。。其實想當一名員警
When I was a kid though, I actually- Iactually did want to be a police officer.

461
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,287
-員警？沒開玩笑吧
-是啊，是啊[ Steve ] A cop?No shit? Yeah. Yeah.

462
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,712
你知道當員警就不能抽大麻了，對吧，麥特？
You do know that you can't smokeweed when you're a cop, right, Matt?

463
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,044
哦，不，真的？額，我不知道
Oh, no. Really?Uh, I didn't know.

Uh, but, no, I-I-I just-I really got into, like, altruism.

465
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,138
什麼意思？利他主義是什麼，麥特？
What does that mean? What does “altruism” mean, Matt?

466
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,187
就是為了別人讓世界變得美好
It's like wanting to make thingsbetter for everyone.

467
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,557
真的？這話居然從一個整天抱怨生活無意義的人口中說出來
Really? This coming from the man who isalways talking about how pointless life is.

468
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,359
是啊，我知道，但這就是我最近在思考的
Yeah, I know, but this is whatI've been thinking about lately.

469
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,779
就好像，我在回想，我只是覺得。。。
Like, I'm looking back,and I just think...

470
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,449
我以前看事情的角度可能更好，你知道嗎
the way I used to think about thingswas probably a lot better, you know.

471
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,825
那又如何，你要出去開始做慈善什麼的嗎？
So, what, you want to go out andstart a charity or something?

472
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,824
-這不靠譜
-等等，為什麼不靠譜？That's lame.Wait. Why is that lame?

473

額，我不知道
Uh, I don't know.[ Groans ]

白癡

475
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,498
我對什麼事都不擅長，我只是盡力而為
I'm not good at everything.I just do my best at everything.

476
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,209
好嗎？事情就是這樣的
All right?That's what it's about.

477
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,465
我是說，你一直談論哲學之類的狗屁玩意
I mean, you talk about philosophyand shit all the time,

你甚至有申請過大學嗎？
Have you even appliedto colleges yet?

480
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,676
不，但是我正要。。。正要申請

Yeah, well, you should get to it.I'm just saying. I am.

你可以採納我的部分意見
You could use some of that.

483
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,399
你可以閉上鳥嘴，怎麼樣？
You could use some 鈥淪hut the hell up.鈥?How about that?

484
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,520
-你只是缺乏主動，這沒什麼大不了的
-是嗎？你“缺乏”雞巴
You just lack initiative.It's not that big- Oh, yeah? You lack a dick.

485
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,735
兄弟們，告訴我們這裡怎麼回事
Boys, please tell uswhat's going on here.

486

口香糖那招挺酷的
[ Steve ] All right.The gum was cool.

506
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,710
你盡力了 但是算失敗的

第一條: 不准用在生物上

00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,198
第二條: 不能在生氣時用 就是這麼回事
Rule number two: You can't use itwhen you're angry. That's it.

00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:02,070
第三條: 我認為我們不該在公共場所用或者告訴別人這事
Rule number three: I don't think we should beusing it in public or telling anybody about it.

我只是覺得我們應該更小心 懂嗎? 我們不能...
I just think that we need to be morecareful now, you know? We can't-

604
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:57,591
我們必須多考慮清楚 不能就直接做要先想清楚 好嗎?
We have to think a little bit more.We can't just do things. We have to think first, okay?

605
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,091

00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,292
- 還挺關心的- 對
concerned about that kind of stuff.Yeah.

777
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,793
你知道 麥特 這你可以自己寄出去的
You know, Matt, you canjust mail this yourself.

778
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,340
我不是你媽
I'm not your mom.

779
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,129
好吧 我是說 我只是...
Okay. I mean, I just-

780
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:04,053
這是怎麼搞的? 這是改頭換面的你嗎?
What is this?Is this, like, the new you?

781
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,553
中一時你高高在上的 現在算什麼?
You got too smart to have funin eighth grade. So now what?

782
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,633
不是的
No.

783
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,184
凱西
Casey, Casey, Casey,Casey, Casey, Casey.

784
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,763
聽著 聽著 我可以跟你談一談嗎?
Listen, listen. Can Ijust talk to you for a second?

785
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,811
我可以告訴你一些事嗎?
Can I just tell you something?Mm-hmm.

786
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,643
我只是...我...
I just- I-I-

787
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,479
我想讓你知道 我不是以前的那個我了
I just want you to knowI'm not, you know, who I was- now.

788
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,360
-你懂嗎 我沒事了 我...
You know, I'm cool.I'm just-

789
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,320
你沒事?
You're cool?

790
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,995
高中比人氣這回事像是古怪的競賽...
High school popularity just seemedlike this weird backward contest,

791
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,947
我當時以為我看清了這一點就...
and I thought sinceI knew that, I could just-

792
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,203
就等於你比其他人都優越
That made you betterthan everybody else.

793
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,408
不 不 不是的
No. No, no, no.

794
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,787
- 我懂你的意思- 我儘量不去接觸那些
I know what you mean.I would separate myself from that.

795
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,163
- 我懂- 你懂嗎?
I get it.You get it?

796
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,543
嗯
Mm-hmm.

797
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,501
我知道聽起來很怪 我只是希望你知道這點
I know it sounds weird.I just wanted you to know that.

798
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,176
知道你沒事了
To know that you're cool.

799
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,970
哇 我真的搞砸了 是吧
Wow, I really screwed this up.

800
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,550
沒你想像的那麼糟
Not as muchas you might think.

801
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,892
- 真的嗎?- 再見
Really?Good-bye.

802
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,390
- 凱西...- 我得走了 拜
Casey-I gotta go. Bye.

803
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,931
真是的
[ Matt Groans ]Come on.

804
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,981
夥計 你什麼時候開始這樣弄的?
[Steve] Dude!When did you start doing this?

805
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,479
- 什麼時候?- 怎麼 你說攝影機嗎?
Like, since when?What, with the camera?

806
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,030
是的 你的攝影機
Yes, with the camera.Um-

807
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,903
我也不記得 我想有一段時間了吧
I don't know. It's beena little while, I guess.

808
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,780
我就沒法那麼做
See- Oh.I can't do that.

809
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,032
我沒法做那種靈巧的事
I can't do stuffthat requires finesse.

810
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,240
昨天我試著打出我的名字結果把鍵盤給折了
I tried to type my name out yesterday,and I cracked my keyboard in half.

811
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:17,452
不 夥計 其實很簡單就想像你用手拿著它
No, dude. it's really easy.You just- You think that you're holding it.

812
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:21,207
-你看，這就是我所要說的
-什麼？See, that's what I'm talkingabout right there. What?

813
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,510
你總是在想一些我們能做的新招式，夥計
You're always thinking upnew shit that we can do, man.

814
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,425
-這太瘋狂了，你知道嗎
-我是說。。。
This is insane.You know- I mean-

815
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,676
是啊，是啊
Yeah.Yeah.

816
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,054
是啊，是的，我想我是的
Yeah. Yes. I guess that I am.

817
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,226
哦！
Whoo!

818
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,226
老媽像是永遠不會回家了
Mom's, like, never home any more.

819
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:46,323
我是說，你看我爸那個樣子，他就這樣安靜地。。。
I mean, you sawhow my dad is. He's just... quiet.

820
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,783
閑坐著
Sits around.

821
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:53,079
跟他說這些都沒意義，因為他沒什麼可說的
And it's pointless to talk to him about it'cause he's got... nothing to say.

822
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,249
你看，這不一樣 因為你一直都很有人緣
See, it's different,'cause you've always had friends,

823
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,703
大家都想跟你聊天 跟你相處
and people want to talk to youand be around you.

824
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,710
我從來沒有過 我是說 在這之前...
I never had any of that.I mean, before this,

825
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,425
我跟麥特都不怎麼相處了他還是我表兄呢
I barely even hung out with Matt, and he's my cousin.[Sirens Walling In Distance]

826
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,344
我們小時候時很親近 但...
We were closewhen we were little, but-

827
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,598
我不知道 到了高中後 一切都改變了
I don't know.In high school, everything changed.

828
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,472
去過太空針塔嗎？
（西雅圖地標建築）
Ever beento the Space Needle?

829
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,225
有啊，好像我5歲時去的
Yep. When I was, like, five.

830
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,315
那是給遊客看的
it's for tourists.

831
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,604
額，我不知道，我是說，我去了。。。
Well, I don't know.I mean, I went, um-

832
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,981
我好像是7歲去的
I think I was, like, seven-

833
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,951
有一次跟我老爸
with my dad one time and-

834
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,538
我不知道，那真的是美好的一天
I don't know.It was actually a really good day.

835
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,199
你記得嗎？
You remember that?

836
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,165
是啊，我記得
Yeah.Actually, I do.

837
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,631
你知道嗎，我一直想問你的
You know, I've beenmeaning to ask you.

838
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,092
寒假快到了
Winter break is coming up.

839
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,803
你應該跟我一起參加才藝秀
You should dothe talent show with me.

840
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,468
不可能
No way.

841
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,676
何不? 這會對你很好的
Why not? lt'd be good for youto get out there, you know.

842
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,100
- 認識些朋友 認識些女孩- 夥計 我不...這不...
Meet some people, meet some girls.Dude, I'm not- it's just not-

843
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,436
- 怎樣?- 我就是很害羞 好嗎?
What? Look, I'm justreally shy, okay?

844
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:07,066
還有 我根本沒有任何才藝
And I don't-I don't even have any talents, so-

845
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,194
你在說啥呢? 你當然有才藝
What are you talking about, youdon't have- You have talent.

846
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,739
你有才藝
You've got talent.

847
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,363
夥計 不可能吧
Oh, dude, no way.

848
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,957
你看起來很帥
[ Chuckles ] [ Mother]You look handsome.

849
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,123
謝謝 史蒂夫...
[ Coughing ]Thanks, yes. Steve-

850
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:29,172
把他的衣服借給我，好讓我看起來酷一點還是什麼的
[Coughing Continues] let me borrow some of hisclothes to make me look cool or whatever.

851
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,171
我很高興你這麼常跟朋友們相處
I'm glad you're spendingso much time with your friends.

852
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:36,554
是啊 我也是
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

853
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,900
- 喂- 怎樣?
[ Father] Hey. What?

854
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,359
你是怎麼上學的?
How are you getting to school?

855
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,871
- 我不懂你的意思- 別跟我胡扯 你這白癡
I don't know what you mean.Don't bullshit me, you idiot.

856
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,617
麥特都不過來了 沒看到他的車
Matt doesn't come.He doesn't drive up.

857
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,838
你自己外出 是誰載你去學校的?
You leave the house.Who the hell's giving you rides to school?

858
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,009
- 麥特- 好吧 你知道嗎?
M-Matt.All right. You know what?

859
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,255
你在騙我
You're lying.

860
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,391
不知道你在幹什麼 但你藏不了的
You're up to something,and you can't hide it.

861
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,807
你以為你可以偷偷摸摸的嗎?
You thinkyou can just slink, hmm?

862
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,139
笑咪咪的在我的屋簷下摸進摸出的?
Sneak in, sneak aroundmy house, smiling?

863
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,605
我看准你了
I'm onto your shit.

864
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,730
這蠢東西到底怎麼操作啊?
[Crowd Noise] [ Matt] How do youeven work this stupid thing?

865
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,576
好戲準備上場了
[Applause ]Ah! And we're in business.

866

- 嘿- 嗨

你來幹什麼?

00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,577
這算什麼 新發現的校園精神嗎?
What is this, some kind ofnewfound school spirit?

872
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,493
自己被人拍感覺如何?
How do you like it, huh?Being on camera? [ Feedback ]

Dude. Why are you talking to me like this?I'm your best friend.

我沒有朋友
I don't have any friends!

在這之前 你從來不是我的朋友

I don't get it.What do you care?

你為什麼不回我電
Why aren't youreturning my calls?

1092

我只是不想跟人聊天

安德魯 在沒有閃電紀錄的情況下...
Andrew? How did heget struck by lightning...

1096
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,714

'Cause I want to have a conversation with you.Don't tell me what to do, Matt.

你幹了什麼 安德魯?

我不知道我做了什麼 我...
I don't know what I did. I-

1117
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,619
我失去了控制 然後...
I lost control, and-

1118

我很對不起

[ Laughing ]Dry off!

1129
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,342
完全。。。
[ Bell Rings ] [Giggling ] Totally.

1130
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,172
喂 偉恩
Hey, Wayne!

1131
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,728
那麼 看到這顆了嗎?
Okay, so, see this one here?

1132
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,810
這顆我拔得很乾淨 因為我...
This one I got really clean'cause I did this little, like,

1133
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,942
在牙根那做了個拉彈的動作 懂嗎?
lasso thing around the root,you know?

1134
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,149
但這兩顆...
But then these two-

1135
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:18,406
就沒拔得那麼好
these, I did not get as good.

1136
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,487
有沒有看到都是斷的?
See how they're broken?

1137
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,915
我想是因為我是從中間拔的 而不是從牙根
I think it's because I got them from themiddle, you know, instead of the root.

1138
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,992
噢，噢
[ Bell Rings]Oh. Oh.

1139
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:29,629
不俐落
Oh. Sloppy.

1140
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,503
我在網上做了很多研究 你知道...
I've been doing a lot of reading,you know, like, online about, like-

1141
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,756
有關進化論和適者生存之類的...
just like evolutionand, like- and natural selection...

1142
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,088
有種東西 好嗎?
and how, like,there's this thing, right?

1143
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,845
叫做頂級掠食者
It is called the apex predator,right?

1144
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:45,646
基本上 它是整個生態系統裡最強的動物 對吧?
And basically what this is is thestrongest animal in the ecosystem, right?

1145
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,098
做為人類嘛...
And as human beings,

1146
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,434
我們...我們被認為是頂級掠食者...
we are- we're consideredthe apex predator,

1147
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,771
但那只因為我們有槍和其他東西...
but only because, like, smalleranimals can't feed on us...

1148
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,605
所以小型動物吃不了我們 對吧?
because of weaponsand stuff, right?

1149
01:02:55,689 --> 01:03:00,365
獅子殺死羚羊時 不會感到罪惡感 對吧?
The lion does not feel guiltywhen it kills a gazelle. Right?

1150
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,162
就像人拍死蒼蠅時不會感到罪惡感
You do not feel guiltywhen you squash a fly.

1151
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,122
我認為這有意義
And I thinkthat means something.

1152
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:11,873
我就是覺得這有意義
[ Cracking ] I just thinkthat really means something.

1153
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,805
這顆我拔得很乾淨 因為我...
[ On Computer] This one I got reallyclean 'cause I did this little, like,

1154
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,386
用了套索的辦法
lasso thing.

1155
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:34,687
安德魯 學校今天發生了什麼事?
[Whooshing, Thumps] Andrew,what happened at school? Huh?

1156
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,314
- 我得去拿我媽的藥- 是嗎?
I need to go and pick up mymom's medication! Oh, yeah?

1157
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,946
你又要不遵守規則嗎? 我們現在太強大了 安德魯
You're gonna break the rules again?We're too strong for that now, Andrew!

1158
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,615
- 你如果要這麼做 你知道我必須怎麼做!- 你必須做什麼?
If you did that, you know what I'd have to do!You'd have to what?

1159
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,784
- 你要想清楚- 你必須怎麼做 麥特?
You have to start thinking.What would you have to do, Matt?

1160
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,365
你這麼做會有後果的
