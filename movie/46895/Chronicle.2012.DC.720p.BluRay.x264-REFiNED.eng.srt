00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,226
Yeah, I'm ready. [ Steve ] All right.
Matt, beam him. Beam him.

310
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,315
I'm- I'm going to.
Beam him.

311
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,856
Oh!

312
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,900
Oh!
No way! Shit!

313
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,697
[ Laughing ] Wait, wait, wait.
That's great!

314
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,487
He did it!
I did it! I did it!

315
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,280
[ Steve] That is crazy!
Oh, my God!

316
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,903
Look at it!
Oh, my God!

317
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,829
[ Steve ] Holy shit! Oh, my God.

318
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,702
Oh, my God. Oh, dude, you're bleeding.
You're bleeding.

319
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,829
[ Steve ] Oh, man, shit.
Stop, stop, stop. Get a tissue.

320
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,794
You did it! Yes!
[Steve Laughing]

321
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,380
Oh. All right. Pop-up.
Ready? Yeah.

322
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,926
[ Groans ]
Yes!

323
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,261
Put on the music.
Oh, yeah.

324
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,473
[ Chuckles ] Yes.
JJ [Dramatic /nstrumenta/]

325
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,175
Yes.

326
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,646
Matt, you have- you have to pretend like you're
squeezing them together with your hands.

327
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:19,446
That's what I'm doing.
Look. That's what I'm doing.

328
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,773
JJ [ Continues ]

329
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,780
I can't do it, dude.
[Groans] I give up.

330
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,828
You do it.
You're better at this than I am.

331
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,622
Oh, really? Am I?
Really?

332
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,449
Just do it.

333
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,793
Oh.

334
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,962
[ Chuckles ]
Sick.

335
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,591
Dude, I hate you!
That's-

336
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,593
I'm impressed, man.
I am impressed. That's amazing.

337
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,140
That was awesome, dude.

338
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,930
Oh, no!
Come on, dude.

339
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,769
That is not cool.
What?

340
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,479
That is not cool.
My Legos.

341
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,566
[ Woman ] You've been hanging out with
those two guys for the last three weeks.

342
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,144
“Three weeks.”
I'm not stupid

343
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,821
I think you're hiding something from me.
You better call me back.

344
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,523
[ Mad] Wow. I love you.

345
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,984
I'm gonna get a brick through my window.
I am legitimately scared.

346
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,365
I have an election coming up,
and I don't have time for this.

347
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,163
Dude, why are you asking us
for advice on girls?

348
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,912
Because we're his mistress.

349
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,661
[ Laughs ]

350
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,625
[Andrew] So, what, you think it's,
like, radiation or something?

351
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,998
[Steve] Radiation from what?
[ Matt] Dude, it's the government.

352
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,799
[Andrew] What?
Matt, what are you talking about?

353
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,627
[Andrew ] I'm feeling pretty
spelunked out actually.

354
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,257
[ Matt]
Andrew, relax.

355
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,214
[ Birds Chirping ]

356
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,513
[ Matt] That's so weird.
It looks completely different during the day.

357
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,638
[Andrew] Look. I don't care, okay?
I am not going in the hole again.

358
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,222
[ Shouts ]
[ Gasps ]

[ Chuckling ]
Asshole.

360
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,978
[ Matt]
It's like sunk in or something.

361
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,824
[Steve Chuckles] There goes your old
camera, dude. [Andrew] Oh, shit.

362
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,493
[ Steve ] That's weird.
I can still feel it down there.

363
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,247
[ Andrew ] I can't believe
we made it out of there.

364
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,542
Well, I mean, that answers that, right?

365
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,833
[Andrew ] Um, what does?
We still don't know what happened.

366
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,422
No- [ Matt] Well,
we're still alive.

367
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,633
I mean, I was definitely- [
Helicopter Overhead ] [ Man ] Hey!

368
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,878
You kids can't be here, okay?
You gotta move on out. What?

369
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,303
[ Helicopter Whirring ] The ground's unstable.
We're taping the whole place off.

370
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,008
[ Chatter On Walkie-talkie ]

371
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,934
Okay. We're going.

372
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,603
[ Steve ] Vote for Steve!
[ Chuckles ]

373
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,566
[ Steve ] New camera's working out for you.
That's good. [Andrew] Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

374
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,109
Yeah, smaller.
Does that shoot on tape?

375
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,027
No, it just- It, like,
records right onto the camera.

376
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,741
No, I just want to record all the
stuff that we can do, you know.

377
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,444
Yeah, but it's like all the time.

378
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,621
You don't feel like
it's a little weird,

379
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,700
like it puts a barrier between
you and everything else?

380
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,752
Uh, I don't know.

381
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,747
Maybe I want a barrier.

382
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:47,093
So, like, what's up with your dad?
What's his story? What does he do?

383
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,217
Um, my dad's a firefighter.

384
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:54,718
Okay. That's cool. Oh, man, that must have
been awesome- Yeah, well, he was, I guess.

385
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,183
What happened? Uh, I don't know.
He didn't die or anything.

386
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,641
He just- He got injured on
the job, and now he, um-

387
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,560
he collects the insurance,
you know.

388
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,022
Um, so he doesn't
really do anything.

389
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,743
He just- He, um- He'll go out during the
day, but I don't know where he goes.

390
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,080
Uh, he drinks a lot.

391
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,991
I know that much.

392
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,579
I've actually been having
some problems with my parents too.

393
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,164
Oh, yeah?

394
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,123
Yeah. I mean,
they're nothing like yours.

395
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:31,213
I mean, not like that-
I just- Never mind.

[ Horn Honks ]

397
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,518
They just been fighting a lot lately.

398
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,143
And I think my mom
is actually cheating on my dad.

[ Horns Honking ]

400
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,900
[ Steve ] Can you not say
anything about that?

401
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,194
[Andrew ] Yeah. No way. Thanks.

She's in pain.

00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,712
She needs something stronger.

Her breathing's worse.

00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,477
Sir, she's suffering.

Please help me.

I can't afford $700.

Please, don't put me on hold! She can't breathe, okay?
I don't know what to do any more.

Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

You're stronger than this.

Can you say that for me?

Um, yeah, of course.

I mean, you know,
I didn't-

428
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,044
I mean, you know, I didn't always.
What do you mean?

429
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,255
I don't know.
Like, you haven't-

430
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,597
You haven't always been
super-easy to talk to, you know.

431
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,224
I mean, I'm not saying that
you're not now. I'm just-

You're such an asshole.

Better.

00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,903
Hey, Matt.
Yeah?

437
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,905
Do you ever think about, like,

438
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,489
doing more with it?

439
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,323
What, with this?

440
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,158
Not really.

441
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,457
Why? What else is there?

442
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,126
“Telekinesis.
” [ Matt] Yes. Do tell.

443
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,004
“The ability to move, lift, vibrate”-

444
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,552

That's my favorite.

or impact objects...

Okay.
Sounds familiar.

448
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,388
It does sound familiar.
Very familiar.

449

Hi.

...Week, in my room.
Just listen.

456
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,747
I'm just that much stronger.
Even last night I got my whole bed off the ground.

457
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,492
No nosebleed. Yeah?
I've been lifting weights too.

458
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,374
This is my theory though
is that it's like a muscle.

459
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,298
Like, it's elastic. If you stretch
it too far, too quick, it'll tear.

460
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,875
Ew.

461
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,377
