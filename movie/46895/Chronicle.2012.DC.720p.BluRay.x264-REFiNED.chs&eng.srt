你的...你知道 你的博客

771
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,899

There's a droughtUin the Central African Republic, right?

772
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,114
我看到你写的 感觉不错 而且不太贵...
Yeah. So I saw that and I thought itUseems pretty cool, and it's cheap too,

773
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,691
所以我想说何不呢?
so I thought why not?

774
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,576

777
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,793
你知道 麦特 这你可以自己寄出去的
You know, Matt, you canUjust mail this yourself.

778
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,340
我不是你妈
I'm not your mom.

779
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,129
好吧 我是说 我只是...
Okay. I mean, I just-

780
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:04,053
这是怎么搞的? 这是改头换面的你吗?
What is this?UIs this, like, the new you?

781
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,553
中一时你高高在上的 现在算什么?

782
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,633
不是的
No.

783
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,184

我可以告诉你一些事吗?
Can I just tell you something?UMm-hmm.

786
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,643
我只是...我...
I just- I-I-

787
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,479
我想让你知道 我不是以前的那个我了
I just want you to knowUI'm not, you know, who I was- now.

788
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,360
-你懂吗 我没事了 我...
You know, I'm cool.UI'm just-

你没事?
You're cool?

790
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,995
高中比人气这回事像是古怪的竞赛...
High school popularity just seemedUlike this weird backward contest,

791
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,947
我当时以为我看清了这一点就...
and I thought sinceUI knew that, I could just-

792
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,203
就等于你比其他人都优越
That made you betterUthan everybody else.

793
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,408
不 不 不是的
No. No, no, no.

794
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,787
- 我懂你的意思U- 我尽量不去接触那些
I know what you mean.UI would separate myself from that.

795
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,163
- 我懂U- 你懂吗?
I get it.UYou get it?

796

嗯
Mm-hmm.

797
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,501
我知道听起来很怪 我只是希望你知道这点
I know it sounds weird.UI just wanted you to know that.

798
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,176
知道你没事了
To know that you're cool.

799
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,970
哇 我真的搞砸了 是吧
Wow, I really screwed this up.

800
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,550
没你想像的那么糟
Not as muchUas you might think.

801
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,892
- 真的吗?U- 再见

真是的
[ Matt Groans ]UCome on.

804
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,981
伙计 你什么时候开始这样弄的?
[Steve] Dude!UWhen did you start doing this?

805
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,479
- 什么时候?U- 怎么 你说摄影机吗?
Like, since when?UWhat, with the camera?

806
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,030
是的 你的摄影机
Yes, with the camera.UUm-

807
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,903
我也不记得 我想有一段时间了吧
I don't know. It's beenUa little while, I guess.

808
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,780
我就没法那么做
See- Oh.UI can't do that.

809
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,032
我没法做那种灵巧的事
I can't do stuffUthat requires finesse.

810
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,240
昨天我试着打出我的名字U结果把键盘给折了
I tried to type my name out yesterday,Uand I cracked my keyboard in half.

811
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:17,452
不 伙计 其实很简单U就想像你用手拿着它
No, dude. it's really easy.UYou just- You think that you're holding it.

812
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:21,207
-你看，这就是我所要说的
-什么？See, that's what I'm talkingUabout right there. What?

813
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,510
你总是在想一些我们能做的新招式，伙计
You're always thinking upUnew shit that we can do, man.

814
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,425
-这太疯狂了，你知道吗
-我是说。。。
This is insane.UYou know- I mean-

815
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,676
是啊，是啊
Yeah.UYeah.

816
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,054
是啊，是的，我想我是的
Yeah. Yes. I guess that I am.

817
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,226
哦！
Whoo!

818
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,226
老妈像是永远不会回家了
Mom's, like, never home any more.

819
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:46,323
我是说，你看我爸那个样子，他就这样安静地。。。
I mean, you sawUhow my dad is. He's just... quiet.

820
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,783
闲坐着
Sits around.

821
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:53,079
跟他说这些都没意义，因为他没什么可说的
And it's pointless to talk to him about itU'cause he's got... nothing to say.

822
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,249
你看，这不一样 因为你一直都很有人缘
See, it's different,U'cause you've always had friends,

823
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,703
大家都想跟你聊天 跟你相处
and people want to talk to youUand be around you.

824
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,710
我从来没有过 我是说 在这之前...
I never had any of that.UI mean, before this,

825
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,425
我跟麦特都不怎么相处了U他还是我表兄呢
I barely even hung out with Matt, and he's my cousin.U[Sirens Walling In Distance]

826
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,344
我们小时候时很亲近 但...
We were closeUwhen we were little, but-

827
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,598
我不知道 到了高中后 一切都改变了
I don't know.UIn high school, everything changed.

828
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,472
去过太空针塔吗？
（西雅图地标建筑）
Ever beenUto the Space Needle?

829
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,225
有啊，好像我5岁时去的
Yep. When I was, like, five.

830
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,315
那是给游客看的
it's for tourists.

831
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,604
额，我不知道，我是说，我去了。。。
Well, I don't know.UI mean, I went, um-

832

我好像是7岁去的
I think I was, like, seven-

833
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,951
有一次跟我老爸
with my dad one time and-

834
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,538
我不知道，那真的是美好的一天
I don't know.UIt was actually a really good day.

835
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,199
你记得吗？
You remember that?

836
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,165
是啊，我记得
Yeah.UActually, I do.

837
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,631
你知道吗，我一直想问你的
You know, I've beenUmeaning to ask you.

838
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,092
寒假快到了
Winter break is coming up.

839
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,803
你应该跟我一起参加才艺秀

What? Look, I'm justUreally shy, okay?

844
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:07,066
还有 我根本没有任何才艺
And I don't-UI don't even have any talents, so-

845
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,194

那么 看到这颗了吗?
Okay, so, see this one here?

1132
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,810
这颗我拔得很干净 因为我...
This one I got really cleanU'cause I did this little, like,

1133
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,942
在牙根那做了个拉弹的动作 懂吗?
lasso thing around the root,Uyou know?

1134
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,149
但这两颗...
But then these two-

1135
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:18,406
就没拔得那么好
these, I did not get as good.

1136
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,487
有没有看到都是断的?
See how they're broken?

1137
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,915
我想是因为我是从中间拔的 而不是从牙根
I think it's because I got them from theUmiddle, you know, instead of the root.

1138
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,992
噢，噢

有关进化论和适者生存之类的...
just like evolutionUand, like- and natural selection...

1142
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,088
有种东西 好吗?
and how, like,Uthere's this thing, right?

1143
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,845
叫做顶级掠食者
It is called the apex predator,Uright?

1144
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:45,646
基本上 它是整个生态系统里最强的动物 对吧?
And basically what this is is theUstrongest animal in the ecosystem, right?

1145
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,098
做为人类嘛...
And as human beings,

1146
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,434
我们...我们被认为是顶级掠食者...
we are- we're consideredUthe apex predator,

1147
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,771
但那只因为我们有枪和其他东西...
but only because, like, smallerUanimals can't feed on us...

1148
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,605
所以小型动物吃不了我们 对吧?
because of weaponsUand stuff, right?

1149
01:02:55,689 --> 01:03:00,365
狮子杀死羚羊时 不会感到罪恶感 对吧?
The lion does not feel guiltyUwhen it kills a gazelle. Right?

1150
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,162
