00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,981
I'll <i>be</i> bored.

271
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:36,191
I'll be hot, irritable, all right, we'll quarrel...
天气会很热，我会很烦躁，我们会吵架，没关系的

272
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,370
but please don't send me away from you.

273
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,363

Oh, thank goodness darling, are you all right?
谢天谢地，亲爱的，没事吧

每个门看起来都一样
- Oh, scrumptious.

I felt like Queen Alexandra driving through Hyde Park.
我觉得像亚历山德拉王后开车穿过海德公园

279
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,357
And you give him a coat, or a trouser, or a shirt, or something to copy.
你给他一件大衣，一条裤子，一件衬衫，或者其他的什么去模仿

280
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,977
One way is to get these little lamps the Hindus have,
获得印度教徒手中小灯笼的一种方法是

281
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,069
and you fold them in the leaves, and you sail them on the water,
把他们折在叶子里，让他们在水中漂浮

282
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,278
and then the croc gets intrigued of course,
接着就会把鳄鱼吸引过来

283
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:26,445
and pops up his head, bang straight in the eye.
它们探出头来，纾直接撞到了眼睛

284
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,450
Eight or nine months later I heard from Cocksons
八九个月后，我听到了这样的对话

285
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,627

it was sitting in the Peshawar bazaar.

287
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,254
It was said to be worth 50 pounds sterling.

288
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,252
Of course Major Minnies, of course.
当然了，梅杰・明尼，毫无疑问

00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,759
An Englishman's word and all that sort of thing.
一个英国人的文字，诸如此类的物件

他妈妈从来不参加他的晚宴吗？
 
291

How could she, what on Earth are you saying,
你想什么呢，她怎么会

292
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,936
with all these men? Not that generation, never.
和一群男人在一起呢？那代人才不会呢，绝不会

293
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:56,266
What about his wife? I mean when they still lived together.
他的妻子呢？我是说他们以前一起生活的时候

Oh, you know about that, do you?
你都知道了，不是吗？

Here, try one of these, they're a bit sticky but quite delicious.
来，尝尝这个，有点儿黏，但是非常好吃

Did you know her, what was she like?

Of course, if it isn't terribly secret.
当然了，如果这不是什么秘密的话

298
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,111
Actually, in a way, it was all my fault.
实际上，某种程度上，都是我的错

299
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,701
She was at school in England with a young cousin of mine,
她在英国上学的时候和我表妹玛乔丽是同学

And then they both fell in love with him.

可怜的玛乔丽，两条短粗的腿，一点儿机会都没有

She was only 16 at the time.
她当时只有十六岁

307
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:32,014

比他小了二十岁，她家人对此并不忧虑

They were trying to get her married off to a Hyderabad prince who was 30 years older.
当时他们正想方设法让她嫁给一位大她三十岁的海德拉巴王子

当然，比我们土邦王大很多的王子

311

There were rumours of poison.

312
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,360
- Good lord.
天哪
- Some said it was the begum
有些人说是因为女王

313
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,196
because she was jealous of her daughter-in-law.

because he'd fallen in love with a dancing girl.

317

Of course, no dancing girl ever materialised

318
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:08,388
so it must've been one of those rumours started by an interested party.
肯定是利益相关方散播了其中一种谣言
319
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,559

Not a very appreciative audience.

可怜的道格拉斯，你知道，他完全是个乐盲

He's tone deaf you know, utterly.

I have a message for you.

- Oh doesn't he?
哦，他不知道吗？

He hasn't looked in my direction once, not once all evening.
他整晚都没有往我这个方向看，一次都没有

好吧，不管怎样，他为什么要往我这个方向看呢？

All the same, he sent me.

他想邀请你和里弗斯先生下周共进晚餐

What's the matter?

00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,546
Darling, you wouldn't know, I'm not for a moment blaming you,
亲爱的，你不知道吗，现在我真的不想责备你
426

他说他会派车来接我们并安排好一切

But why should he send a car? We can go with the Crawfords.
他为什么要派车接我们呢？我们可以和克劳福德夫妇一起去

没有克劳福德夫妇，他不会邀请我们的

He wants us, darling,
亲爱的，他只邀请了我们

443

because we're amusing and nice and they're not.
因为我们有趣又平和，不像克劳德福夫妇

Why it's most irregular.
因为这完全不合常理

446

Since when does royalty throw parties for junior officers?

亲爱的，我知道这一切对你来说很困哪

456
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,072

但这全都是因为你在一个全新的环境中

As a matter of fact I was talking about this very thing to Beth Crawford.
实际上，我还和贝丝・克劳福德说过这件事

你千万别生贝丝的气，她是好意

I'm really not fit for anything else.
但其他的事情我也不适应

467

But you're worth a jolly sight more
与其只做我这个家伙的妻子，你值得

468
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,623
than to be just the wife of a chap like me.

Well done.

529
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,836
Olivia never told Douglas about the Nawab's picnic.
奥莉维亚从来没跟道格拉斯提起和土邦王野餐的事

530
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,801
She had meant to as soon as she got home,
她一回到家，就打算告诉道格拉斯

531
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,841
but it so happened that he'd been held up
但碰巧那天，集市上发生刺杀事件

532
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,506
by a stabbing incident in the bazaar that day
他脱不开身

533
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,432
and was even later than usual.
比平时回来的晚

534
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,762
She never did get around to telling him about her day.
她一直没有机会把那天的事情告诉道格拉斯

535
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,897
And when he left next morning, she was still asleep.
当第二天早上他离开的时候，她还在睡觉

536
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,102
So instead, she wrote the first of those long,
因此，她写下了第一篇非常长的
537
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,440
really intimate letters to Marcia.

538
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,824
Inder Lal's family always comes to the annual religious festival
英德尔・拉尔的家人经常参加在土邦王的祖先，阿曼努汗・坎

539
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:25,415
at the tomb built by Amanullah Khan, the Nawab's ancestor.
建造的圣坛的一年一度的宗教节日

540
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,165
Amanullah Khan built the shrine for a Muslim saint,
阿曼努汗・坎建此圣坛是为了纪念一位穆斯林圣人

541
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,710
but now it's a sacred place for both Hindus and Muslims.
但现在这个神圣的地方既属于印度教徒也属于穆斯林教徒

542
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,968
That's the way things happen in India, everything gets mixed up and absorbed.
在印度很多事情都是这样的，开始融合并相互吸引

543
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,565
"Shadi", "shadi", meaning marriage,
沙迪，沙迪，是婚姻的意思

544
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,316
that's what they keep asking me.

"Why aren't you married?"

我告诉她们，你们为什么不帮我找一个好人呢？

549
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,289
So they asked Maji to provide a candidate.
因此她们请玛姬挑选一个候选人

550
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,169
Maji's a sort of wise woman whom everyone consults about their problems.
玛姬是个聪明的女人，每个人有问题都会请教她

551
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:15,093
She said "God would provide", which is her usual response.
通常她都会说，上帝会给她指派的

552
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,913
Maji said Lilavati had been coming here

every year, for 30 years.
每年都会来这儿乞讨

554
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,797
Once she'd been a farmer's wife but her husband died

555
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,670
and her in-laws wouldn't keep her
公婆不要她了

556
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,422
so she began to beg for her living.
因此她开始以乞讨为生

557
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,721
She goes round to all the pilgrim spots because that's where people
她去到各种朝圣的地方，因为在那些地方

558
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,427
are most disposed to be charitable.
人们最愿意施舍了

559
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,058
Giving to the poor is one way of accumulating a good record
施舍穷人是一种积德的方式

560
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,140
so as not to have to be born again.
这样就不必经历重生了

561
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,945
This water is incredibly cold.
这里的水非常的凉

562
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,367
It's always like that.
一直都这么凉的

563
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,311
How do you know, have you been here before?

564
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:11,543
I read it somewhere. Are you an American?
我在某处读到的，你是美国人吗？

565
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,830
Canadian?
加拿大人？

566
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,590
I'm not anything now.
现在我哪儿人也不是

567
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,676
I've taken sanyas.
我已经接受涅

568
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,196
That means you strip off everything,
也就是说我脱离了一切

569
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,213
your hair, your clothes, all your personal possessions
头发，衣服，所有的私人财产

570
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,640
and your identity.

571
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,351
It's all burned up on a funereal pyre.
一切都在火堆里烧掉了

572
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:33,022
So it's like dying as a material being
就像是生理上死去了

573
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,145
and being reborn spiritually.
精神上重生了

574
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,662
And what about you?
说说你吧

00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,956

我在做调研

For myself, like you.

577
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,540
I'm not researching Hinduism, I've become a Hindu.
我不是在调研印度，而是成为了一名印度教徒

578
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,592
Actually, research was what I used to do in England,

it was my job, I worked with the BBC.

And you didn't find it all that fulfilling either?
你从中没有找到成就感？

581
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,885
You wouldn't be here if you did.

582
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,600
I gave it ，I gave it all up...
我放弃了，放弃了一切

583
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,528
because it wasn't reality.

It took me a long time to realise that what the Romans had was limited power
我花了很长时间才意识到罗马人拥有的是有限的满足

627
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:06,477

You see, materialistic power is limited.

But back home they're afraid of that.

Afraid that you might overthrow their power structure.

我只是看一下  快放下      看看又不会怎么样

我没打算偷看你的信件，我是在找钱

650
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,418
Anyway, where would I ever find a Nawab
不管怎样，如果我需要一个土邦王

651
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:53,330
even if I needed one, I mean if I wanted one.
我要去哪儿找呢？我是说当我真的需要的时候

Bring you reports from the Civil Lines at Satipur?

他是个统治者，才不会和一群盗贼同流合污呢

Not to put too fine a point on it to outright robbery.

I told you, it's the heat.

假如他不是，你认为我是吗？

it's always the same, they've aborted her.
他们给这些女人堕胎的方法一模一样

1047

They stick this twig into her and do it with that.
把这个树枝插进女人的身体里帮她们堕胎

1048
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:30,160
Abortion, mind you, it's a criminal act.

1049
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,335
And then they try to fool me.
他们居然想骗我

里佛斯，很抱歉让你听我发牢骚，你找我有什么事吗？

I wanted to ask you a particular favour.

你认识皇宫里那个哈里・汉密尔顿保罗吗？

哦，哈里，认识

I wonder what he's been eating over there.
我想知道他在皇宫里一直吃什么

1057
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:02,904

土邦王陛下，这是饮食习惯的问题

1058
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:05,786

When I say, "What did you eat?"
当我问，你吃了什么？

1062
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,123
They'll say, "Only what you said Dr Sahib,"
他们回答，萨希卜医生，都是听从您的要求

1063
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:19,542
but of course they can't fool me.

是吗？那这些辣椒是怎么回事？

这就是你所谓的咖喱吗？简直是睁眼说瞎话

Sometimes I don't waste any time.

这是他们唯一能听懂的两个词
- You're absolutely right, Dr Saunders.
桑德斯医生，你说的很对

1069
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:37,561
Well, it's no use arguing with them. They're not amenable to reason.
跟他们争论也没用，他们不懂得推理

1070
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:42,361
They haven't got it here you see, up here, the way we have.
他们不会像我们这样用脑，思考问题

He really is exceptionally obnoxious.

我不知道你是怎么想的，但请不要把我和他们混为一谈

哈里，你不会认为克劳福德夫妇像桑德斯医生

or the Minnies, or for that matter, Douglas.

1076
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,462
And you?

1077
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,385
They're all the same.
他们都是一类人

1078
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,134
So you do lump me in with them.
所以你确实认为我和他们一样

You, I wouldn't for a minute, not for a minute think of you,

speak of you in the same breath.

哈里，奥莉维亚，你们听我说

1084
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:29,199
instead of having a rotten time let's have some fun.
与其在这儿虚度时光，不如找点儿乐子

Let me tell you a dream, my dream, my latest dream, you know.
我和你们讲一个梦，一个我的梦，我最近做的梦，你们知道吗

I dreamt of Mrs Crawford.

- What's a hijra?

We must educate her.

Thinking again?

01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,554
She knew many ways, but at this stage
她知道很多种办法，但目前这个阶段

1171
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:33,681
a simple massage could do it.
有一种简单的按摩方法

1172
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:22,393
No, Maji, no, Maji, no.
不，玛姬，不玛姬，不要
1173
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:27,852
I asked her over and over.
我一次又一次地问她

1174
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:32,490
"You didn't really do anything, did you? Nothing will happen?"
你没有真的做什么，是吧？胎儿也没事，是吧？

1175
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:36,028
And she assured me no, she didn't, "No, it wouldn't."
她向我保证，她什么都没做，胎儿没事

1176
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,824
Then she asked me, "You want the child?"
接着她问我，你想留下这个孩子？

1177
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:45,454
And I said, "Yes I do, I do."
我回答她，我想，我想要，我想要

1178
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:02,478
Darling, Olivia, are you partaking?
亲爱的奥莉维亚，你喝酒吗？

1179
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:07,020
- Major?
梅杰？
- Yes, please.
是的

1180
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:09,696
Well.
好吧

1181
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:15,700
To our charming hostess who has elected to stay with us
敬我们美丽的主人，在瘟疫爆发的时候

1182
01:46:15,744 --> 01:46:18,612
through our ordeal far down in the plague.
选择和我们一起共度难关

1183
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:20,663
Yes, rather.
是的，非常勇敢。

1184
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:23,001
Here, here.
干杯，干杯

1185
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:27,545
But Major, aren't you due for a spot of leave in the hills?
但是梅杰，你不是要休假去山里避暑吗？

1186
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:31,007
Yes, but this is not the time to go.
是的，但现在不是时候

1187
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:34,127
Our friend the Nawab has been acting up again
我们的朋友土邦王又在挑事了

1188
01:46:34,179 --> 01:46:36,136
and I'm afraid things are coming to a head.
我怕事态会控制不住

1189
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:39,474
At present I wouldn't like to be in that boy's shoes.
目前我还不太清楚这个家伙在打什么主意

1190
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:41,561
Which boy's shoes?
哪个家伙？

1191
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:43,519
Our friend.
我们的朋友

1192
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:47,766
I trust Simla isn't gonna dillydally any further over him.
我相信他不会去西米拉那么远的地方消磨时光的

1193
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:50,477
It's certainly time he was taught a lesson.
是时候给他点儿颜色看看了

1194
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:52,570
You talk as if he's a school boy.
你说的好像他是个不听话的学生

1195
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,824
Ah, I wish it were that harmless.
啊，我希望他不是个危险的学生

1196
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,276
Olivia, he's a dangerous ruffian.
奥莉维亚，他是个危险的暴徒

1197
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:01,947
Those dacoits of his are running around killing and maiming
他手下的那些强盗在他的保护下

1198
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:04,078
with his blessing, under his protection.
四处残害良民

1199
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:07,460
He's a menace to himself, to us,
他不仅对我们是个危险人物，对他自己

1200
01:47:08,213 --> 01:47:11,126
and to the wretched inhabitants of his wretched little state.
对那个可怜的国家，人民也是个危险人物

1201
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:13,378
He's the worst sort of ruler.
他是最危险的统治者

1202
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:16,169
The worst sort of Indian you could have.
可能是你见过的最危险的统治者

1203
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:25,015
Dear lady, are you leaving us?
亲爱的女士，你要离开了吗？

1204
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,556
To your brandy and cigars.
远离你们的白兰地和雪茄

1205
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:34,654
She's very plucky.
她真的很勇敢

1206
01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:37,441
I believe it went up to 118 today.
我觉得今天的温度达到118华氏度了

1207
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,198
All right Rivers, better go and see how she is.
里弗斯，没关系的，你还是去看看她吧

1208
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:43,447
Will you mind, sir? I think I ought to.
先生们，失陪一下，我去看看她

1209
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:49,828
So, they are setting up a committee of inquiry?
这么说，他们成立了一个调查委员会？

1210
01:47:50,506 --> 01:47:51,506
Yes.
是的

1211
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:53,877
And I'm rather afraid...
恐怕他们打算

1212
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:57,001
they'll be putting our Nawab out of business
把我们的土邦王踢出局

1213
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:58,303
which is a pity,
真遗憾

1214
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:00,672
because there's no denying he has a quality.
因为不可否认的是他本质不坏

1215
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:02,841
He is a prince.
他可是个王子

1216
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:07,395
Yes, but the trouble is, his little state isn't quite princely enough to satisfy him.
没错，问题是他那个小国家，不足以满足他王子般的需求

1217
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:11,350
Poor fellow is tremendously bored.
可怜的家伙是太无聊了

1218
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:14,982
I think he'd do anything to amuse himself.
我觉得他会做任何事愉悦自己

1219
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:21,119
Olivia.
奥莉维亚

1220
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:30,044
What is it?
你怎么了？

1221
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:33,747
I ought to tell you.
我应该告诉你的

1222
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,041
It isn't just the heat.
不仅是天气热的原因

1223
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,466
What is it? Tell me.
那是什么，快告诉我

1224
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:42,932
Are you ill?
你生病了吗？

1225
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:45,476
Olivia.
奥莉维亚

1226
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:50,769
The fact is, I'm pregnant.
其实，我怀孕了

1227
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:54,694
Darling.
亲爱的

1228
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:59,777
Darling, it's what we want, more than anything.
亲爱的，孩子 是我们最想要的

1229
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:03,951
Yes, of course it is.
是的，当然了

1230
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:33,561
Good morning.
早上好

1231
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:37,519
I'll have to keep bringing more Dickens for Mr Hamilton-Paul.
我给汉密尔顿保罗先生又拿了几本狄更斯的书

1232
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:40,776
We're on <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> now.
我们在看我们共同的朋友

1233
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:41,908
Ah.
啊

1234
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:45,360
He can't seem to get enough of foggy London...
他似乎欣赏不够伦敦的雾色

1235
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:47,495
...and Christmas revels.
和圣诞的狂欢

1236
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:52,166
- Isn't it extraordinary?
是不是很奇怪
- Yes indeed, extraordinary.
是的，确实很奇怪

1237
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:03,428
It was all so murky, both sides intriguing.
一切都是暗箱操作，双方都在密谋策划

1238
01:50:03,764 --> 01:50:07,804
The British too, they were playing their own game,
英国人也一样，他们只想参与属于他们自己的游戏

1239
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:09,475
they always did.
他们一向如此

1240
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:14,598
They'd set up some sort of committee to depose him.
他们成立了某种委员会罢黜了他

1241
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:19,728
"Put him out of business" was the facetious phrase they used.
他们的官方术语是踢出局，很滑稽

1242
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:28,112
And, for his successor, they'd picked out some halfwit,
他们任命了他妹妹的儿子

1243
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:30,200
epileptic nephew.
那个患有癫痫症的傻外甥

1244
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:33,871
He was the son of the Nawab's sister.
继承王位

1245
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:38,289
That of course was because the Nawab had no son of his own.
当然也是因为土邦王自己没有子嗣

1246
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:41,799
As it turned out in the end
结果我最后

1247
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:46,550
it was more convenient to drop the nephew than simply to swallow up the whole state
罢黜这个外甥提供了便利，轻而易举地将整个国家

1248
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:48,590
into British India.
纳入英国殖民的印度地区

1249
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:52,727
How dare they appoint anyone to inquire into my activities.
他们怎敢派人调查我的行踪？

1250
01:50:53,230 --> 01:50:55,643
I told him. I told your Major Minnies.
我告诉他了，告诉你的梅杰・明尼

1251
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:56,732
Why mine?
为什么是我的？

1252
01:50:57,693 --> 01:51:00,026
No, of course not, you have nothing to do with it.
不，当然不是你的，和你一点儿关系都没有

1253
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:04,906
Anyway I made it very clear that from now I shall deal with the viceroy, personally.
不管怎样，我表明了我的态度，从现在起，我要亲自和总督交涉

1254
01:51:05,367 --> 01:51:06,608
I told him.
我和他说了

1255
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:08,735
I don't deal with underlings Major Minnies.
我不喜欢梅杰・明尼这群党羽

1256
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:10,865
I know what this is all about.
我知道这一切是为了什么

1257
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:16,122
I know why they hate me, because I don't say, "Yes, Your Excellency."
我知道他们为什么恨我，因为我不说，阁下，遵命

1258
01:51:16,378 --> 01:51:17,914
"Very good, Your Excellency."
非常好，阁下

1259
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:19,792
"How right and true, Your Excellency."
你说的没错，阁下

1260
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,206
I have something to tell you.
我有个消息要告诉你

1261
01:51:21,383 --> 01:51:22,383
What is it?
什么消息？

1262
01:51:25,596 --> 01:51:27,929
What is it? Tell me.
什么消息？告诉我

1263
01:51:30,142 --> 01:51:31,258
Can't you guess?
你不能猜猜吗？

1264
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:35,602
I'm pregnant.
我怀孕了

1265
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:54,989
You're made to bear a child.
你注定要怀孕的

1266
01:51:57,961 --> 01:51:59,202
Are you afraid?
你害怕吗？

1267
01:52:02,007 --> 01:52:03,373
Don't be afraid.
别害怕

1268
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:07,377
Now they'll see.
现在他们等着瞧吧

1269
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:12,306
- Who'll see?
谁？
- Major Minnies and the rest of them.
梅杰・明尼还有其他人

1270
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:15,806
They'll laugh out of the other sides of their mouths
当他们见到我儿子的时候

1271
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,345
when they see my son.
会笑的前仰后合

1272
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:20,728
Do you mean because...
你的意思是……

1273
01:52:21,902 --> 01:52:23,109
of the colour?
肤色的原因吗？

1274
01:52:23,195 --> 01:52:26,484
Oh, they'll get the shock of their little English lives.
哦，他们会为这个英国小生命而震惊的

1275
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:28,491
No, no.

1276
01:52:29,785 --> 01:52:31,026
You mustn't go.
你不能离开

1277
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:36,122
I want you to stay here, you must.

1278
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:40,168
My son must be born here in my house.
我的儿子必须在我的房子里出生

1279
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:43,459
How can you be so sure?

1280
01:52:44,633 --> 01:52:47,467
I'm very sure, absolutely.

He's mine.

1282
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,088
He couldn't not be.
不可能是别人的

1283
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:53,927
What about Douglas?
道格拉斯呢？

He's as sure as you are, and he's my husband.

1285

Oh, I'm pretty sure.

1290
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:48,149
And he'll do something decent too, you'll see.
你看着吧，他将来会从事非常体面的工作

1291
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:53,442
I must ask my sister to send the Rivers' christening robe.
我要让我姐姐把里弗斯家的洗礼长袍寄过来

1292
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:56,194
All the Rivers babies are christened in it.
里弗斯家的孩子都是穿着它接受洗礼的

You know, they're all very blond.
你知道的，他们都是金发碧眼

Look, I'm sorry.

We won't come back again.

Come on darling, let's go.

I can hardly find an abortionist for you.

Ask your friends in the purdah quarters.

It'll be easy enough for her.
对她来讲，轻而易举

1303
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:56,759
Easier than poisoned garments any day.
比用衣服毒死人容易多了

1304
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:03,511
I couldn't refuse her.

1305
01:55:03,855 --> 01:55:07,064
I didn't want to see this baby born any more than she did.
我和她一样不想这个孩子出生

1306
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:11,645
No one did, except the Nawab and Douglas.
没人想，除了土邦王和道格拉斯

1307
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:16,027
The begum was glad to help.
女王非常愿意帮忙

1308
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:19,740
She wanted no complications with the British on the one hand

1309
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:23,532
nor did she fancy a little Eurasian heir.
有一个欧亚混血的继承人

1310
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:27,160
Of course, there had to be the utmost secrecy
当然这是最高机密

1311
01:55:27,379 --> 01:55:29,541
because if the Nawab had ever found out
因为一旦被土邦王发现了

1312
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:31,748
he'd have killed someone.
他会杀了所有人

1313
01:55:31,883 --> 01:55:35,467
He believed 'til the end that it was a natural miscarriage.
一直到最后，他都相信是自然流产

1314
01:56:06,501 --> 01:56:08,959
She had begun to bleed the same night
当晚她就开始流血

1315
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:10,752
and Douglas took her to the hospital.
道格拉斯带她去了医院

1316
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:13,505
Well, my young madam.

1317
01:56:14,593 --> 01:56:17,711
But Dr Saunders was all too familiar with the methods

1318
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:21,093
used by Indian midwives to procure abortions.
印度助产士的堕胎手段

1319
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:26,101
I never knew how she got from the hospital to the palace.
我一直都不知道她是如何从医院逃到皇宫的

1320
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:28,475
A distance of nine miles.
那可是九英里的距离

1321
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,683
And she could hardly have walked it in the middle of the night
她刚堕胎，失血过多，那种状态几乎不可能

1322
01:56:31,776 --> 01:56:36,020
and her condition with all that loss of blood from her abortion.

1323
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:40,654
She'd borrowed some servant's sari in the hospital.
她在医院向一个仆人借来纱丽

1324
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:43,907
She reminded me of one of those mutiny prints.
这让我想起了当时的一则暴乱新闻

1325
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:49,334
I think it's called "Mrs Secombe In Flight from the Mutineers".
我记得一名叫斯科姆太太的女人从暴徒手中逃了出来

1326
01:56:50,253 --> 01:56:52,495
Now Mrs Secombe was also in native dress

and in a state of agitation.
焦虑不安

1328
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:56,798
Olivia was in flight as well,

1329
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:00,048
but of course, in the opposite direction,

1330
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:02,839
from the civil station at Satipur

to the Nawab's palace at Khatm.

1335
01:57:42,389 --> 01:57:44,722
And his kidneys too, sit up.

1336
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:48,141
What does he expect?
他在想什么

1337
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:51,353
Even I wouldn't think of eating and living the way he has done.
即使我也不能想象像他那样的吃饭和生活

1338
01:57:55,277 --> 01:57:57,769
My prescription for him is to put him on the next plane home
我给他的建议是马上乘飞机回家

1339
01:57:57,821 --> 01:57:59,403
and the sooner the better.
越快越好

1340
01:58:03,827 --> 01:58:07,946
My dear young man, your body's not made to live the life of a holy man.
亲爱的年轻人，你的身体不是让你以圣人的方式生活的
  
1341
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:12,541
Psst. Let's go.

What about you, when are you going?

Don't know, I haven't made any plans.

1344

When my money runs out I suppose.

I'm staying with my Aunt Betty in Iowa, Washington Iowa.
我会和爱荷华州的贝蒂阿姨住在一起，华盛顿的爱荷华州

It's the cleanest city in the whole USA.
那是全美国最干净的城市

Her embroidery and her piano.

has returned the compliment.

As good as.

the Nawab got himself worked up.
