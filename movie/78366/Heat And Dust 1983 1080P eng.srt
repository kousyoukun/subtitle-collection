1
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,675
- Mr Rivers.
- Oh, good morning Matron.

2
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,299
- Good morning.
- How is your patient?

3
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,010
Dr Saunders would like a word with you.

4
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,216
Is something wrong?

5
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,886
The doctor's waiting in his office.

6
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,065
Ah, Rivers, good morning.

7
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,605
I've been waiting for you.

8
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,032
How is my wife?

9
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,322
Your wife is no longer in the hospital.

10
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,079
Your wife has left our charge.

11
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,532
She's disappeared.

12
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,368
When Sister went in this morning,
she was gone.

13
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,956
Are you trying to tell me that
she went home by herself... in her state?

14
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,528
I'm trying to tell you, Rivers,
that she left of her own accord.

15
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,341
We don't know when, we don't know where.

16
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,593
I knew she was rotten
from the first day I saw her.

17
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,607
Raman?

18
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,069
Raman?

19
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,284
Raman!

20
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,036
Gopi?

21
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,039
Abraham?

22
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,383
Gopi?

23
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Olivia?

24
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Olivia?

25
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,536
Olivia.

26
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,667
Olivia.

27
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,463
Douglas was married again
soon after the divorce

28
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,296
and to someone far more
suitable than Olivia.

29
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,137
He produced a whole lot of
little empire builders I believe.

30
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,260
That was the trouble with Olivia,

31
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,896
he kept telling her she wasn't
enough of an empire builder,

32
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,228
she wasn't a proper memsahib.

33
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,110
You don't look like one either,

34
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,817
not that they breed them anymore.

35
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,316
I say is this thing still on?

36
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,112
Oh no, the tape's run out.

37
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:36,038
Yes, I suppose nowadays
you just go out there

38
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,959
to follow some guru or something.

39
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,374
Is that what you are doing?

40
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,085
No of course not, of course not.

41
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,046
<i>See, she was outraging
two con ventions,</i>

42
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,804
<i>those of her own people,
and those of the Indians,</i>

43
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,967
<i>whose con ventions are,
if anything, e ven stronger.</i>

44
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,303
<i>And of course you can 't do anything...</i>

45
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,230
Thanks awfully, Harry,
you've been absolutely wonderful.

46
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,941
God knows what
indiscretions I committed,

47
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,734
what beans I've spilt.

48
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,396
Not that it matters a hoot anymore.

49
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,825
Oh, look, this is you.

50
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,288
You've kept all those letters
Olivia wrote to Marcia, have you?

51
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,990
Yes, of course.

52
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,625
You know, you don't
look like Marcia used to,

53
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,129
not one bit.

54
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,085
No, I suppose women have changed,

55
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,883
it's not like it was.

56
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,387
Your grandmother carrying on in Paris.

57
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,221
Olivia in India.

58
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,596
My goodness but they were romantic,

59
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,436
all for love and that sort of thing.

60
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,891
You've got better things
to do now I dare say, hmm?

61
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,977
Oh...

62
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,565
I don't know.

63
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,687
What?

64
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,857
- Speak up.
- Well.

65
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,026
The same, you'd better
be careful out there.

66
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,701
I hope you've had all those
injections one has to have.

67
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,699
I wouldn't like to see you
going to Satipur without them

68
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,121
or to Khatm.

69
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,254
Anne, always remember,

70
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,128
every old India hand
will tell you the same thing...

71
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,177
no water, ever, anywhere.

72
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,551
That's golden rule number one.

73
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,019
And no uncooked foods,
no fruit, no salads...

74
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,929
golden rule number two.

75
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,003
I always wanted to research,

76
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,706
search out what happened to Olivia.

77
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,880
She was my grandmother Marcia's sister

78
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,886
and wrote long revealing letters

79
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,761
which my grandmother gave
to my mother, and she to me.

80
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,760
But now I'm getting involved
not only in Olivia's life,

81
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,601
but in others,
like the family I board with.

82
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,981
Namaste.

83
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,105
And sometimes
the two are difficult to reconcile.

84
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,520
We're beginning to
look slightly civilised.

85
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,568
Mrs Crawford, the collector's wife,

86
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,111
the Burra Memsahib,

87
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,569
came to inspect me in my nest today.

88
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,160
I don't think she thinks much of me...
or the nest,

89
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,487
but she's very tactful.

90
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,454
She told me she knows how difficult
the first year always is

91
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,126
and if there was any little thing

92
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,374
she could possibly do
to ease things for me,

93
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,999
well, I must just consider
her to be always there.

94
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,551
I said "thank you", demurely.

95
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:20,058
Actually, her being there
is the only difficult thing,

96
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,435
otherwise everything is just too perfect.

97
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,930
If only I could have told her that.

98
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,723
Sir Rufus Mackleworth,

99
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,313
Mr James Crawford,

100
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,266
Major Arthur Minnes.

101
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,591
It's not what you're used to.

102
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,306
Oh, it's far better
than what I'm used to.

103
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,097
But don't you like a chair
or a table, some curtains?

104
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,139
Curtains?

105
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,808
I'd much rather look out.

106
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,037
- Did you understand that?
- No.

107
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,495
She said the food is ready.

108
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,575
"Bhojan" means food.

109
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,336
"Bho" - it's like with a "bo" and a "huh" -
bhojan.

110
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,234
- Please take your rent.
- Oh, there's no need really but...

111
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,624
So bhojan...

112
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,878
Bhojan?

113
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,216
The social circumstances are such...

114
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,171
Ritu?

115
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,011
That...

116
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,220
We really have no choice.

117
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,193
Anne?

118
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,201
I'd be interested in knowing your opinion
on early marriages.

119
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,420
I don't know anything about it,
why don't you ask Ritu?

120
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,585
She's not used to talking
with people very much.

121
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,894
House.

122
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,851
Oh, that's better, that's lovely.

123
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,819
This is very good, very good,
loose, it's good.

124
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,370
How do I look?

125
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,378
You don't have to come
with me, I am all right,

126
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,518
really I am.

127
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,531
I... oh, dear.

128
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,903
I was going to the post office
and I thought I'd wait for you.

129
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,483
- Here.
- No thanks.

130
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,904
You know, I can't get over the fact

131
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,828
that your office is in Olivia's bungalow.

132
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,851
In fact, I think...

133
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,583
...that you're right in what
was her drawing room.

134
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,956
Uh huh, come on let's go.

135
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,209
- What's wrong, Inder Lal?
- It's okay.

136
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,889
Look, I know there's something wrong.

137
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,002
- Do tell me what it is.
- It's nothing Anne.

138
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,983
- It's nothing.
- Oh, you must please.

139
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,188
Look, there's so much
I want to talk with you about

140
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,948
but these people they're just ignorant,

141
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,491
they don't know anything.

142
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,443
They just, you know,
they think the reason

143
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,158
you've been waiting for me all this time

144
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,706
is that it's sexual,
that's all they know.

145
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,603
Oh, my goodness,
I didn't even think about that.

146
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,993
I'm so sorry.

147
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,037
Why should you be sorry?

148
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,625
They should be sorry.

149
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,007
They're just ignorant fools.

150
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,820
Just the other day
I heard of an incident

151
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,951
with an English lady in Muzzafarnagar.

152
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,079
It was her dhobi, Mrs Rivers.

153
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,990
Her own washerman.

154
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,084
He was ironing her undies.

155
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,171
Of course, got excited.

156
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,670
In a way you can't blame them,
it's their constitution,

157
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:19,172
and all that spicy food they eat,
it heats the blood.

158
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,093
Well, what is it now?

159
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,640
Oh, my goodness.

160
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,025
They only have one thought
in their heads Mrs Rivers,

161
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,484
and that's to...

162
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,316
you-know-what with a white woman.

163
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,751
Have you seen our darling's grave?

164
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,751
- No.
- Come.

165
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,842
We got the statue, that angel over there,

166
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,137
from an Italian marble
cutter settled in Mirat.

167
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,309
It's beautiful.

168
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,484
My baby was beautiful, too.

169
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,536
Every day I tell Willy, "let's go home".

170
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,875
I know I can't have my baby back,
but let's go.

171
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,995
Come, come, Joan.

172
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,750
You mustn't do that.

173
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,046
This is the worst season for it,
that's when then heat's starting.

174
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,446
As soon as we get her off to Simla

175
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,462
she'll be as right as rain,
won't you old girl?

176
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,471
My mother keeps asking,
"Why isn't Anne married?"

177
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,478
I don't know what to tell her.

178
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,351
What should I tell her?

179
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,189
Well, oh well, I can tell you.

180
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,738
I did want to, only...

181
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,035
the person I was with,
he was married

182
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,501
and he kept saying
he was going to get a divorce.

183
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,870
Then he finally did...

184
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,963
only he married someone else.

185
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,508
I mean, someone different, not me.

186
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,177
Well, no matter,
we'll find you an Indian husband.

187
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,135
- Ah.
- A very nice, rich Indian husband.

188
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,598
And then you can live here
and have a lot of Indian children.

189
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,435
- Would you like that?
- What, children?

190
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,521
No, you know an Indian husband.

191
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,648
Someone like me.

192
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,985
But you think I'm very ugly, don't you?

193
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,405
- Oh, horrible.
- Oh.

194
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,917
Begum Sahib welcomes you.

195
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,835
She is very happy to meet this...

196
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,379
Angelic girl.

197
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,763
- Angelic girl.
- Thank you.

198
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,432
Mrs Rivers is the wife
of our assistant collector,

199
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,891
and we are privileged indeed
to have so charming a couple in our midst.

200
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:17,187
The assistant collector...

201
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,114
- Have you been to India before?
- No.

202
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,110
This is absolutely my first time,

203
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,037
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

204
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,921
How long have you been married?

205
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,206
Six months.

206
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,791
We were married in England

207
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,586
but I only followed my husband
out here a few weeks ago.

208
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,143
Any children?

209
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,349
We were married in September.

210
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,567
She hopes that the durbar
wasn't too tiring for you.

211
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,903
Oh, I loved every moment of it.

212
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,486
It looked splendid and was so well done.

213
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,200
It was thrilling to see your son, the Nawab.

214
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,407
I've always like to hear
the Khatam national anthem.

215
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,323
You must be terribly proud of him,
he's terrifically handsome and...

216
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,082
How does it go?

217
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,204
He'd cause a sensation
in any London drawing room.

218
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,498
Olivia?

219
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,003
Olivia?

220
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,933
You know, they think
they're frightfully clever,

221
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,810
but really they're so transparent.

222
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,562
- Who?
- Indians.

223
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,069
All of them.

224
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,604
From our mali
right on up to the Nawab, there.

225
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,981
They're like children.

226
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,154
They look like very grown up men to me,

227
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,486
certainly the Nawab does.

228
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,824
Where's his wife?

229
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,960
Oh, she's not here,
she ran away and left him.

230
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,583
Oh really? Tell me.

231
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,839
Oh, I don't know.

232
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,541
He eloped with her to Paris.

233
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,922
Her family didn't like it
so they broke it up,

234
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,256
something of that sort.

235
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,057
I say, did you see
that new memsahib,

236
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:57,717
did you notice her?

237
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,386
That tall blonde?

238
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,100
Oh yes, yes.

239
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,959
I thought she was a distinct improvement
on the others.

240
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,895
- Not that that's saying much.
- HE LAUGHS

241
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,982
Listen, I remembered another
memsahib joke.

242
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,940
It's about this Englishwoman
that went to the races in Calcutta.

243
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,819
Her shoelace came undone

244
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,446
and when she bent down to tie it up

245
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,535
a jockey came along
and plonked a saddle on her.

246
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,830
Exactly, because she looked like a horse.

247
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,833
And when her friends all asked her,
"My dear, whatever did you do?"

248
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,834
She said, "What could I do, my dears?"

249
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,080
"I came third."

250
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,303
Oh, I was talking to Beth Crawford today.

251
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,590
Now they're leaving for Simla
at the end of next month

252
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,472
so I asked her to book you
a berth at the same time

253
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,556
on the Kalka Mail.

254
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,271
It's over night but it won't be too bad,
I promise you.

255
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:48,185
Now the journey up to the mountains
is another four hours, but what a journey.

256
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,237
You'll love it.

257
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,271
The scenery,
not to mention the changing climate.

258
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,115
You don't for one moment
think I'd go without you?

259
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,826
But Beth will be there,
and Mary Minnies.

260
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,390
They'll take care of you.

261
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,531
Oh, that's just silly Olivia.

262
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,701
Mother spent four months away from father
every year, year after year.

263
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,999
She didn't like it either but,

264
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,794
when you're in a district
that's the way it has to be.

265
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,635
You have no idea how hot it gets.

266
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,844
It can drive you mad.

267
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,349
You'll be irritable,
we will quarrel over every little thing.

268
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,683
I'm not going.

269
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,145
You don't think I like it
any better than you do, do you?

270
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,981
I'll <i>be</i> bored.

271
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:36,191
I'll be hot, irritable,
all right, we'll quarrel...

272
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,370
but please don't send me away from you.

273
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,363
I believe you've made a mistake.

274
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,035
Olivia.

275
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,446
Oh, thank goodness darling,
are you all right?

276
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,977
Well I sort of got lost
and there's so many doors...

277
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,709
- ...and they all look exactly the same.
- Oh, scrumptious.

278
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,561
I felt like Queen Alexandra
driving through Hyde Park.

279
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,357
And you give him a coat, or a trouser,
or a shirt, or something to copy.

280
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,977
One way is to get these
little lamps the Hindus have,

281
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,069
and you fold them in the leaves,
and you sail them on the water,

282
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,278
and then the croc gets intrigued of course,

283
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:26,445
and pops up his head,
bang straight in the eye.

284
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,450
Eight or nine months
later I heard from Cocksons

285
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,627
that there's a greasy piece
of paper with my name on it,

286
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,209
it was sitting in the Peshawar bazaar.

287
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,254
It was said to be worth
50 pounds sterling.

288
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,252
Of course Major Minnies, of course.

289
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,759
An Englishman's word
and all that sort of thing.

290
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,424
Doesn't his mother ever come
to any of his dinner parties?

291
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,828
How could she,
what on Earth are you saying,

292
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,936
with all these men?
Not that generation, never.

293
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:56,266
What about his wife?
I mean when they still lived together.

294
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,809
Oh, you know about that, do you?

295
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,442
Here, try one of these,
they're a bit sticky but quite delicious.

296
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,069
Did you know her, what was she like?

297
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,904
Of course, if it isn't terribly secret.

298
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,111
Actually, in a way, it was all my fault.

299
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,701
She was at school in England
with a young cousin of mine,

300
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,207
Marjorie, and I took both the girls
to a party

301
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,625
that he was giving at Claridges.

302
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,287
It was all very thrilling
and totally out of bounds for them.

303
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,376
And then they both fell in love with him.

304
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,459
Poor old Marjorie with her stumpy legs,
she never had a chance.

305
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:26,592
- The other one was very pretty, of course?
- Oh god yes, Sandy was a peach.

306
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,384
She was only 16 at the time.

307
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:32,014
Twenty years younger than he was,
not that that's what bothered her family.

308
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:35,681
They were trying to get her married off
to a Hyderabad prince who was 30 years older.

309
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,604
Of course, he was a much bigger prince
than our Nawab.

310
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,025
His wife's family had to come
and take her away.

311
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,106
There were rumours of poison.

312
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,360
- Good lord.
- Some said it was the begum

313
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,196
because she was jealous
of her daughter-in-law.

314
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,074
She'd already got rid of his first wife
years before.

315
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,536
But some said it was the Nawab himself

316
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,047
because he'd fallen in love
with a dancing girl.

317
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,459
Of course, no dancing girl ever materialised

318
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:08,388
so it must've been one of those rumours
started by an interested party.

319
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,559
It had been Sumerca and Keifer
and God knows where,

320
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,844
it had come over the Khyber pass

321
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,146
and was presented at the Peshawar bazaar

322
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:21,397
and was still said to be worth
50 pounds sterling.

323
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,523
He's heard that story
at least six times.

324
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,487
So have I and I've only been here
three weeks.

325
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,805
I don't think I could bear
to hear one more anecdote

326
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,493
about what happened in Kabul in 13,
don't you know, old chap?

327
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,894
Sometimes I think I must be
the only person in the world

328
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,501
whose grandfather was not
at the siege of Lucknow.

329
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,501
- Mine wasn't.
- Douglas's was, of course.

330
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,957
He said, "Work?"

331
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,811
"You won't have to work
for your first year."

332
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,322
"Oh by the way, Rivers I've got a..."

333
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,554
He's very good looking, I like him.

334
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,055
Oh, do you?

335
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,012
So do I.

336
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,808
We were just talking about you.

337
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,519
Nothing about good I assure you.

338
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:05,361
The state of Khatm has always been renowned
for its hospitality.

339
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,573
Except in the time of the chap,
what's his name?

340
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,483
"Ana" something, Pan.

341
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,943
Amanulla Khan.

342
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,288
Oh, Dr Saunders, I hope you're not going
to hold that against me?

343
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,791
It's not fair Dr Sahib.

344
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,993
Perhaps Your Excellency
has not heard the story

345
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,333
of my ancestor and the party he gave?

346
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,090
A neighbouring prince, the raja of Mong,

347
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,801
had done something
to displease my ancestor.

348
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:33,223
So he invited the raja and his retainers
to a feast.

349
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,434
A ceremonial tent was put up,

350
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,057
some choice arrangements were made,

351
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,516
and when the guests
were seated to eat and drink

352
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,481
to their heart's content,
just as we are now,

353
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,481
at that very moment Amanullah Khan

354
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,150
gave a secret sign to his men

355
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,698
and they cut the ropes of the tent

356
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,617
so that the raja and his party

357
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,165
were entangled under the canvas.

358
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,285
When they were trapped there like animals,

359
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,963
Amanullah Khan and his men
took their daggers

360
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,672
and stabbed them through
the canvas again and again,

361
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:16,011
'til there was not one
single enemy left alive.

362
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,431
They still have that tent, Mrs Rivers

363
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,937
and the blood is so fresh and new

364
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,939
it's as if it had only happened yesterday.

365
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,938
The cause of this enmity
was something very small.

366
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,024
A trifling, one could say.

367
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,365
The raja had broken his word
over a marriage contract,

368
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,452
not with Amanullah himself
but with one of his followers.

369
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,033
It was a question of honour

370
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,750
and Amanullah Khan
was not the man to sit quietly

371
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,580
when he or anyone of his was insulted.

372
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,085
Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

373
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,679
to the King Emperor.

374
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,832
- The King Emperor.
- The King Emperor.

375
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,758
Rivers is going to the village of Rampur
in the morning.

376
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,391
They've been threatened with a raid.

377
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,014
Retaliatory raid.

378
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,352
Obviously one of the villagers
informed on the gang.

379
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,600
They kill a few people,
break arms and legs,

380
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,564
cut off noses, the usual sort of thing,

381
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,527
just to show everyone who's who.

382
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,613
And the Nawab gives them his protection?

383
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,736
Yes, in return for a share of the loot,

384
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,237
at least that's what we suspect.

385
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,365
He's nothing but a common brigand.

386
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,082
It's just one dash thing after another.

387
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,704
Ah, but Crawford,
that's the definition of our business,

388
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,481
getting out of one dash
thing after another.

389
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,998
What couldn't I give
to get out of this one?

390
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,092
Gentlemen.

391
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,828
What's that singing?

392
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,875
It's the entertainment.

393
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,412
Oh, do you think it would
be all right to go and see?

394
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,625
Well I suppose so, if you really want to.

395
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,220
These things are supposed
to be strictly for men.

396
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,972
Oh well, go on.

397
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,134
Hello.

398
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,510
Strange music.

399
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,512
- Do you hate it?
- Heavens no.

400
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,928
I've just never heard anything like it.

401
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,055
Not a very appreciative audience.

402
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,772
Poor Douglas,
he's putting up a great show.

403
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,979
He's tone deaf you know, utterly.

404
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,606
I have a message for you.

405
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,113
Oh yes?

406
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,566
As a matter of fact he sent
me out to give it to you.

407
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,782
- But he doesn't even know I exist.
- Oh doesn't he?

408
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,285
He hasn't looked in my direction once,
not once all evening.

409
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,792
Well, almost not once anyway,
why should he?

410
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,166
All the same, he sent me.

411
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,498
He wants to invite you and Mr Rivers
to dinner next week.

412
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,213
Just the two of you, <i>en famille.</i>

413
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,422
Just Douglas and me?

414
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,181
He also wanted me to tell you
that it would make him very happy.

415
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,222
It would be fun.

416
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,429
- I have to go.
- Oh no.

417
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,728
Please.

418
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,680
I'll be back in the evening.

419
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,856
In the evening.

420
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,615
Sleep a bit more.

421
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,296
Douglas?

422
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,975
Douglas.

423
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,307
I forgot to tell you something.

424
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,389
What's the matter?

425
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,546
Darling, you wouldn't know,
I'm not for a moment blaming you,

426
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,006
but you shouldn't let the servants
see you like this.

427
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,111
See me how?

428
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,276
I'm as demure as a nun, look.

429
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,157
Oh, this is too ridiculous.

430
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,118
What did you want to tell me?

431
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,417
The Nawab's invited us
to dinner on Wednesday.

432
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,296
- Oh no, not again.
- What do you mean "not again"?

433
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,297
It's the only decent place we've been to.

434
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:05,920
At least it's amusing.

435
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,553
- Amusing? Gosh.
- Well, he wants us, anyway.

436
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,301
He says he'll send a car and everything.

437
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,724
But why should he send a car?
We can go with the Crawfords.

438
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,052
Oh, you don't think
they've been invited do you?

439
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,770
Well, he wouldn't ask
us without the Crawfords.

440
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,891
I mean Mr Crawford's the burra sahib,
he's my superior.

441
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,605
He's also a superior bore.

442
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,946
He wants us, darling,

443
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,366
because we're amusing
and nice and they're not.

444
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,909
- What, just us, just you and me?
- Well, why not?

445
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,949
Why it's most irregular.

446
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,294
Since when does royalty throw parties
for junior officers?

447
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,746
It's very irregular.

448
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,671
Oh, God.

449
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,599
I wish you'd trust me on this.

450
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,645
I really do know best,
really I do, darling.

451
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,100
You don't know.

452
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,814
When you're gone, there's nothing,
there's nobody.

453
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,771
My goodness, the days are long.

454
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,444
I never knew days could be so long.

455
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,027
I know it's difficult for you, darling,

456
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,072
but it's all just because it's all so new.

457
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,289
As a matter of fact I was talking about
this very thing to Beth Crawford.

458
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,630
And you mustn't think that way about Beth,
she's a good sort.

459
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,719
And do you know what she said?
She said that, well, someone as sensitive

460
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,504
and as intelligent as you,

461
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,469
see she does appreciate you...

462
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,433
well, that you'd surely be all right here,

463
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,643
but you, and this is what she said,

464
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,856
that you'd "come to feel
about India just as we do".

465
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,361
I know it's easy for me, I have my work.

466
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,326
I'm really not fit for anything else.

467
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,516
But you're worth a jolly sight more

468
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,623
than to be just the wife
of a chap like me.

469
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,410
I should say so.

470
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,755
I do love you.

471
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,342
See you tonight.

472
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,516
I may not be here.

473
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,225
If it gets too boring I'll run away.

474
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,017
- I'll play blind.
- Playing blind?

475
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,605
All right one, two.

476
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,730
- Yes, you have to show your cards...
- Show? One.

477
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,991
There you are.

478
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,014
You cheated me.

479
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,870
Honestly, I didn't see your cards.

480
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,991
One, two.

481
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,217
So this is how you spend your time,
you idle fellow...

482
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,364
- ...playing cards with women?
- I'm not playing anymore.

483
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,300
I've never seen such abdominal cheating.

484
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,144
- You're her own dear son.
- If I am your own dear son,

485
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,188
you shouldn't be cheating me like this.

486
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,396
Cheating, not I.

487
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,902
- Pay your debts.
- Come on, Harry, pay up.

488
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,314
All gentlemen pay their gambling debts.

489
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,695
What would they say in the club?

490
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,826
And what would our Mr Crawford say,

491
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,744
the esteemed burra sahib?

492
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,080
And what about our esteemed
sahib, Mr Rivers?

493
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,785
Oh, here, I've got this
courteous note from Mr Rivers.

494
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:56,567
We've left Satipur,
all this is his great state of Khatm.

495
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,733
Yes, we've left British India.

496
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,316
Now you're in my power, like him.

497
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:08,077
I'm only joking.

498
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,990
I had to go with them, I couldn't not.

499
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,326
He said he'd be so terribly hurt if I didn't,

500
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,916
if I refused his invitation again.

501
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,124
Look at him, Mrs Rivers.

502
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,442
What sort of an Englishman are you?

503
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,799
One who can't stand
your goddamn climate.

504
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:06,546
My climate?
Well, Mrs Rivers can stand it very well.

505
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,758
Oh dear, dear, Mrs Rivers,
what shall we do with him?

506
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,643
He's letting down the side.

507
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,145
That's not a proper Englishman.

508
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,224
Do you know what I think?
I think he's a very improper Englishman.

509
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,071
Here.

510
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,781
This place is sacred
to the memory of Baba Firdaus,

511
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,371
a holy man.

512
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,911
It was built in his honour
by my ancestor Amanullah Khan.

513
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,292
Oh, the one you told
that frightful story about

514
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,829
who trapped all his guests in a tent
and had them stabbed.

515
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:44,333
You... You call that frightful do you?

516
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,718
I suppose you're right.

517
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,173
Baba Firdaus gave him shelter here
after battle.

518
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,553
That's why he built this shrine in gratitude.

519
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,643
He never forgot a friend or an enemy.

520
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,385
The British liked him very much.

521
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,479
- I think you like such people, don't you?
- We do?

522
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,235
Yes, you know,
rough people that fight well,

523
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,864
mostly on a horse,
but best of all, you like the horse.

524
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,528
But you're not like that.
You don't like the horses, do you?

525
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,241
You're right, I don't.

526
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,074
You see how well I read your character?

527
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,222
Thank you, thank you.

528
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,063
Well done.

529
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,836
Olivia never told Douglas
about the Nawab's picnic.

530
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,801
She had meant to as soon as she got home,

531
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,841
but it so happened that he'd been held up

532
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,506
by a stabbing incident
in the bazaar that day

533
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,432
and was even later than usual.

534
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,762
She never did get around to telling him
about her day.

535
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,897
And when he left next morning,
she was still asleep.

536
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,102
So instead,
she wrote the first of those long,

537
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,440
really intimate letters to Marcia.

538
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,824
Inder Lal's family always comes
to the annual religious festival

539
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:25,415
at the tomb built by Amanullah Khan,
the Nawab's ancestor.

540
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,165
Amanullah Khan built the shrine
for a Muslim saint,

541
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,710
but now it's a sacred place
for both Hindus and Muslims.

542
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,968
That's the way things happen in India,
everything gets mixed up and absorbed.

543
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,565
"Shadi", "shadi", meaning marriage,

544
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,316
that's what they keep asking me.

545
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,778
"Why aren't you married?"

546
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,320
"How come you don't have a husband?
No children?"

547
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,945
"How can you live like that?"

548
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,290
I told them why don't you find
someone really nice for me?

549
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,289
So they asked Maji to provide a candidate.

550
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,169
Maji's a sort of wise woman
whom everyone consults about their problems.

551
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:15,093
She said "God would provide",
which is her usual response.

552
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,913
Maji said Lilavati had been coming here

553
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,544
every year, for 30 years.

554
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,797
Once she'd been a farmer's wife
but her husband died

555
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,670
and her in-laws wouldn't keep her

556
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,422
so she began to beg for her living.

557
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,721
She goes round to all the pilgrim spots
because that's where people

558
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,427
are most disposed to be charitable.

559
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,058
Giving to the poor is one way
of accumulating a good record

560
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,140
so as not to have to be born again.

561
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,945
This water is incredibly cold.

562
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,367
It's always like that.

563
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,311
How do you know,
have you been here before?

564
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:11,543
I read it somewhere.
Are you an American?

565
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,830
Canadian?

566
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,590
I'm not anything now.

567
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,676
I've taken sanyas.

568
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,196
That means you strip off everything,

569
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,213
your hair, your clothes,
all your personal possessions

570
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,640
and your identity.

571
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,351
It's all burned up on a funereal pyre.

572
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:33,022
So it's like dying as a material being

573
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,145
and being reborn spiritually.

574
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,662
And what about you?

575
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,956
- I'm doing some research.
- What, on your PhD?

576
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,957
For myself, like you.

577
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,540
I'm not researching Hinduism,
I've become a Hindu.

578
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,592
Actually, research was what
I used to do in England,

579
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,347
it was my job, I worked with the BBC.

580
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,884
And you didn't find it
all that fulfilling either?

581
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,885
You wouldn't be here if you did.

582
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,600
I gave it all up...

583
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,528
because it wasn't reality.

584
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,106
I even gave up my name.

585
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,075
My guru gave me a new one,
Chidananda.

586
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,198
- Chid.
- Ananda.

587
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:31,327
- Chidananda.
- It means bliss of mind.

588
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,201
But you can just call me Chid.

589
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,286
Chid.

590
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,830
Are you coming in?

591
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,175
- Oh it's nice.
- Hm, very nice.

592
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,477
You can't have any money
or anything, just this.

593
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,654
People have to give you food
or anything that you need.

594
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,618
One rupee is good?

595
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,502
Two.

596
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,590
You've got a lot of room here.

597
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:12,220
Just for a couple of days, for a little rest.

598
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,269
All right, all right, but just two days.

599
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,021
I'll show you where.

600
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,501
Nice.

601
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,756
It's the light around our
body that controls our mind.

602
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,004
A pure unharmful mind
is a place of perfect happiness.

603
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,809
- Light.
- Light?

604
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,142
Whoa, all right come over.

605
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,269
No, no, no, no.

606
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,323
By the way, when are you leaving?

607
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,204
They want me to stay.

608
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,624
Do you even know
how poor these people are?

609
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,161
They can't afford to feed you.

610
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,542
They like it, they like giving.

611
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,922
By giving they're taking good karma
for their next reincarnation.

612
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,261
So you're helping them
to a better time in the next life

613
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,673
by eating their food in this one?

614
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,934
I used to be just like you, once.

615
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,063
I wanted materialistic power.

616
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,310
I was fascinated with power.

617
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,007
I went to the library
and got all these books

618
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,820
on Julius Caesar and Octavius Augustus,
those sort of people.

619
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,239
I figured that today's
equivalent is big business,

620
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,870
big multinational corporations.

621
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,121
You know I tried to get in
on an IBM training course one time,

622
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,247
but my grades weren't good enough,

623
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,250
and they said that I was crazy,

624
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,672
and they sent me to the hospital.

625
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,134
That's a tazkiyah procession.

626
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,559
It took me a long time to realise
that what the Romans had was limited power

627
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:06,477
and that the only unlimited power
is what they had in the Vedanta.

628
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:10,902
You see, materialistic power is limited.

629
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,778
Real power is absolute,
unlimited and undefined.

630
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,828
You see, you must be
independent in your thinking.

631
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,372
But back home they're afraid of that.

632
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,913
Afraid that you might overthrow
their power structure.

633
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,662
So they say you're crazy...

634
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,374
put you in a hospital.

635
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,872
What are you doing?

636
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,162
I'm just looking,
there's no harm in looking.

637
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,484
You shouldn't be looking through
other people's things like that.

638
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,249
- Absolutely.
- Just throw it all out.

639
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,418
I'll throw <i>you</i> out!

640
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,739
If I ever catch you going
through my things again

641
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,928
I'll throw you out, beads and bangles,
begging bowl and all.

642
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,468
Let go of me.
You know I'm surprised at you.

643
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,933
I wasn't going through your papers,
I was looking for money.

644
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,436
- Money, what do you need money for?
- Well, you want me to go.

645
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,193
You live free, you eat free,
you beg in the streets.

646
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,440
Don't touch.

647
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,698
I know what you think.

648
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,572
You think you're Olivia,
her reincarnation.

649
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,872
You've seen the photos of her.
How could I ever be her?

650
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,418
Anyway, where would I ever find a Nawab

651
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:53,330
even if I needed one,
I mean if I wanted one.

652
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,623
I know what you need, you need sex.

653
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,008
You mean <i>you</i> do.

654
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,670
Why don't you get out of here?

655
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:01,838
I can't help it.

656
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,826
It gets to this enormous size,
do you want to see?

657
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:04,966
No, I don't.

658
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,913
It's due to the mediation,
I mean that's a fact,

659
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,930
I get charged up
with this terrific voltage.

660
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,018
No, don't laugh, it's a liability.

661
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,354
Now come on, Anne.
Ow, ow.

662
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,068
Psst.

663
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:58,774
Psst, Anne, Anne?

664
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,549
You're cutting yourself off
from the real love experience.

665
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:25,051
It's not just sex,
it's a union with all life.

666
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,430
The sexual drive
is towards the ultimate orgasm.

667
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:35,140
That ultimate union
rising up through the chakras

668
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,775
to the third eye, the pineal gland.

669
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:42,147
Explosion of light
at the top of the skull.

670
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:47,452
An out of sight, spaced out,
super consciousness.

671
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,285
Jesus Christ.

672
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,246
You've got to get in touch
with your own femininity, Anne.

673
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,545
With your own inner space.

674
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:58,523
What do you think about
me taking her to a doctor

675
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,021
who specialises in this sort of thing?

676
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,819
You only get well
if you believe in something, Anne.

677
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,527
What do you mean like that,
what's going on in there?

678
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:08,566
Laugh at us if you wish.

679
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,949
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't laugh at you.
I mean how can, why should I?

680
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:17,205
It's just I think it's worth trying
a different form of treatment.

681
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,785
I think I should take her to Delhi.

682
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,921
- There must be doctors there who...
- You mean a psychiatrist?

683
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,925
- Who asked you?
- Don't listen to her.

684
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,630
Psychiatrists are gross.

685
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:30,384
Stay out of this,
I'm talking to Inder Lal.

686
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:33,391
I'm telling you, I know.

687
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,644
Let's just try, I mean I'll...

688
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,360
I think it's just worth trying,
me taking her there.

689
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,991
Look there's no need,
we've made other arrangements.

690
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,244
Have you, what sort of arrangements?

691
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:57,578
Well, we're going to a pilgrimage
to Amarnath.

692
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,828
Mother wants to go.

693
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,459
- A pilgrimage?
- Yeah.

694
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,416
But what... Oh gosh, oh dear.

695
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:07,800
They all say this must be done
and if I say no they will blame me for it.

696
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:11,175
Look do give him something.
And then there's this man behind.

697
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,963
Please give him something.

698
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,058
You know, some yogis
can actually take their intestines out

699
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,015
wash them, clean them
and put them back in, all nice and clean.

700
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,222
How disgusting.

701
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:25,212
I've never seen anyone like you
for telling other people

702
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,398
that their ideas and philosophies
are disgusting.

703
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,155
What good are philosophies
and ideas when someone's sick?

704
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,901
All they can come up with to help her
is to take her on a pilgrimage.

705
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,494
That's right, and I'm going to.

706
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,538
We're going up to Amarnath
to see the Shiva Lingam.

707
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:38,910
Other nostril.

708
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,412
What's that, Shiva's prick?

709
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,327
Yeah something like that.

710
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,123
It's an object of Hindu worship for women
from the day they are born.

711
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,045
Now breathe.

712
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,838
It's eight feet tall.

713
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,298
You should come with us, Anne.

714
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,883
<i>It's more than 50 years ago,</i>

715
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,304
<i>but I'll ne ver forget
the dust storms we had that year.</i>

716
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:05,316
<i>They blew all day, they blew all night.</i>

717
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,065
<i>Ifyou left a chink open anywhere</i>

718
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:11,481
<i>within seconds there would be
a fume of dust o ver e verything.</i>

719
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,277
<i>It got in your eyes, your nostrils,</i>

720
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,574
<i>it was gritty between your teeth.</i>

721
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:22,997
<i>Once those dust storms started,
they seemed to go on fore ver.</i>

722
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:27,079
No, no, please,
I wouldn't like to disturb you.

723
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,414
Oh, that's all right.

724
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,002
Have you had a letter?

725
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,168
Yes, I had this letter from Mother.

726
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,295
They got as far as Palghat.

727
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,055
- Oh, that's a good, isn't it?
- They send you greetings.

728
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:38,599
See it says...

729
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:41,431
<i>Hot winds whistled and columns of dust</i>

730
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,638
<i>came blowing in from the desert.</i>

731
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,978
No wonder everyone went mad.

732
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:48,902
I gave up.

733
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:54,239
I simply lay in bed,
too lethargic to do a thing.

734
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,943
And I was a young man then, mind you.

735
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,833
But then it was decided
we were to go to the mountains,

736
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,665
into the cool air, not to Simla,

737
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:15,883
where all the official British types went,
but to Masuri, where the Nawab had a house.

738
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,558
Well, we all packed up
and there was great excitement

739
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:25,643
and relief and I can tell you
we could hardly wait to get up there.

740
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:30,477
Then the begum heard an owl.

741
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,362
Or at least I think it was an owl.

742
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,858
Anyway, it was something inauspicious,

743
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:40,324
a warning that we must on no accounts
set out on a journey.

744
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,021
The Nawab was very restless, excited,

745
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,520
never sat still for a minute.

746
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,156
He was very short tempered with all of us.

747
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:21,952
I couldn't help
remembering what I'd heard,

748
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:26,624
about how he was in league
with Tikaram's gang.

749
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,794
Tikaram was a dacoit

750
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,625
with a price of 10,000 rupees on his head.

751
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,506
He and his gang
went all around the countryside

752
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:42,720
looting people and killing anyone
who got in their way,

753
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,892
or even just for the fun of it.

754
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,058
They could do all this with impunity

755
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,977
because they enjoyed
the Nawab's protection.

756
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,734
At least, that's what the British said.

757
01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:00,317
They said he took a share in their loot
and used them as his henchmen

758
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,735
and if anyone informed on them

759
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,745
they would take their revenge
on a whole village.

760
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,748
If something really horrible happened...

761
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,545
don't you think I ought to...
help you bear it?

762
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,097
It all started in a...

763
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,893
in a house in Chota bazaar.

764
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,979
Two women quarrelling
over a bucket of water.

765
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:24,609
But in this season, with the heat coming on,
things grow and build up

766
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,139
and before you know where you are,
you have a full scale riot on your hands

767
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,870
and then there's no holding anyone.

768
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:35,165
They were throwing acid today.

769
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,588
They were aiming for the face, eyes.

770
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,597
The screams.

771
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:49,888
I'll never forget those screams.

772
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,448
- Superintendent, one round only.
- Take aim.

773
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,406
Fire.

774
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:54,351
The British also suspected the Nawab

775
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:58,540
of using the dacoits
to help inflame riots against them

776
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:02,415
like the one outside the Satipur Jail in,

777
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:04,670
I think it was 1923.

778
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:10,306
Anyway, Crawford was away on tour
and Douglas was in charge

779
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:14,848
and had to arrest the ringleaders
of what had been a very ugly massacre.

780
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:21,646
Well,
when all these kinds of things happened

781
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,937
I just gave up and ran
away to Olivia's house

782
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,943
and begged her to play some Schumann.

783
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,538
Lovely.

784
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:45,801
Lovely.

785
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:28,418
You don't mind if Harry stays with us
for a day or two, do you?

786
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:29,678
What?

787
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:31,972
Oh, no.

788
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,303
No, no, I want him to.

789
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,886
It's better for him to be here than there.

790
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,292
<i>Bra vissima.</i>

791
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,927
Oh, what fun.

792
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,380
You do know Mr Hamilton-Paul,
don't you, Beth?

793
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,800
I most certainly do, we've met
oh, so many times at the palace.

794
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,635
He's come to stay with us for a while.

795
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,103
Oh, I'm so glad that
you're not alone at this time.

796
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,598
Not that there's anything
whatsoever to worry about Olivia.

797
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,450
That's what I came here
to speak to you about.

798
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:30,813
And Arthur is back and he and Douglas
have the situation absolutely in hand.

799
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:34,942
- What situation?
- Oh you know, the usual.

800
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,036
You mustn't think about.

801
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,078
Now what I really want you
to think about is Simla.

802
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:43,288
No dear I'm not nagging at you,
but we really all do feel...

803
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:46,545
It's true Olivia, you shouldn't be here
through the summer, it's unbearable.

804
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,127
- But if you can bear it?
- Who said I could?

805
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,965
One summer we did manage
to get up to Masuri.

806
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,883
The Nawab has a marvellous house up there,

807
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:59,175
it's a swish chalet
with a dash of gothic cathedral.

808
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,512
Very impressive indeed.

809
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:02,761
Not that I got much time to enjoy it.

810
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:06,641
A dead bat was found in all of places
the begum's bedroom

811
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,025
so we had to pack up
and come back home immediately.

812
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,715
Actually, this year I wasn't thinking so much

813
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:14,026
of going to the mountains
as of going home.

814
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,696
You see I'm worried about my mother,

815
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,701
she hasn't been too well and...

816
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,662
Well, of course you must go.

817
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,914
And do you know the Ross-Milbanks?

818
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,993
He's been the DC over at Cawnpore.

819
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,121
They're on home leave now
driving down to Bombay

820
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,414
to catch the P&O

821
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,425
But those P&O
aren't they always booked up,

822
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,298
completely booked, months ahead?

823
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,341
Oh, but a single berth.

824
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,557
And we could always send
a cable to the Gibbons in Bombay.

825
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,469
- Really?
- Really and truly.

826
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,223
Mr Gandhi's lot
probably stirring things up again.

827
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,774
They never miss a chance.

828
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,160
No, don't bother to get up.

829
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,368
Where are Mr and Mrs Rivers?

830
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,492
They've gone to church
and then I think they're going to the club.

831
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,537
Oh, what's here?

832
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,127
Tea, toast and marmalade,
boiled eggs three minutes,

833
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,128
an English newspaper.

834
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,889
Four months old but yes it's English.

835
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,352
Well, I can see you have
thoroughly deserted us.

836
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,356
My poor mother and all
the ladies keep asking,

837
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,569
"Where is Harry, when is he coming home?"

838
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:37,739
I answer he <i>is</i> home,
he's with his own people whom he loves.

839
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,321
Isn't that true?

840
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:42,514
Now you see, you don't say anything.

841
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,325
You don't give one a chance to say anything.

842
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,828
I know I'm a monster egoist,

843
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,501
or a plain monster.

844
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,592
But my goodness for a monster,

845
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,799
I do grow fond of other people

846
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:01,918
and miss them when they leave me.

847
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,970
Now what's the matter?

848
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:09,016
- I can just see you missing me.
- Oh no, of course not.

849
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,685
I'm here for the sole purpose
of leaving my calling card

850
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,062
on Mr and Mrs Rivers.

851
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,196
Don't be a fool, Harry.

852
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,525
You know why I'm here.

853
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,958
- See you later, old man.
- Bravo.

854
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,999
Oh, Olivia, do tell Mr Hamilton-Paul

855
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:36,040
that the Milbanks
are getting here on Tuesday

856
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,486
and could take him with them to Bombay.

857
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,718
- We have a berth for him.
- Good work, Beth.

858
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:44,973
But darling, Harry's the Nawab's guest.

859
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:48,469
He can't just run out on him
at a moment's notice with Mrs Crawford...

860
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:49,723
- Morning.
- Morning.

861
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:52,848
- ...Mrs Crawford's friends.
- I can't see what's wrong with that.

862
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,859
But the Nawab paid his fare

863
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:01,197
and he's been keeping him, hasn't he,
in the lap of luxury for some time?

864
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,362
He shouldn't be there
in the first place.

865
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,204
No Englishman has any business
living in that palace.

866
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,084
Don't be so stuffy.

867
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,297
I'm sorry.

868
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:20,467
Those are my feelings
and I must be allowed to express them.

869
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:27,637
I could do without this
particular Sunday caller.

870
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,478
I'm delighted to see you.

871
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,897
Mrs Rivers, what a charming dress.

872
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,447
And Mr Rivers, I'm more than delighted
to congratulate you on your handling

873
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:45,154
the Chota bazaar incident.
You were most prompt.

874
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,139
I wish I'd been prompt
enough to get there

875
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,779
before rather than after the event.

876
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,156
Oh, Mr Rivers, what can be done?

877
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,574
These people will never learn.

878
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:56,082
As to your conduct in this miserable affair
there's nothing but praise.

879
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:57,921
You are misinformed.

880
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,172
It sparked off a lot of resentment.

881
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,683
You must've heard of all the troubles
outside the jail and other places.

882
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,338
They get hot and then they cool off.

883
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:07,968
It's like our weather and its season.

884
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,886
Please get dressed, we must go.

885
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,386
Oh, Mrs Crawford asked us
to tell you that the Milbanks

886
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:15,181
are arriving on Tuesday
and they're expecting you to go with them.

887
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,891
Oh, to Bombay?
Yes, Harry told me about it.

888
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,189
Please get dressed, my dear fellow.

889
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,604
I hope you don't expect me
to take you home in this state.

890
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,945
Mrs Crawford says that they
have booked a berth for you.

891
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:30,120
There's been a misunderstanding.
I shall apologise to Mrs Crawford myself

892
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,869
and thank her for her kind efforts
on behalf of my guest.

893
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:36,084
But you wanted to go,
your mother is ill.

894
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:37,877
We must be thankful.

895
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:39,750
Mother is better.

896
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,963
And my mother has written to her
to invite her to the palace.

897
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:47,299
She has written, I translate from Urdu,

898
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,306
"You now have not one son but two..."

899
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,846
"...and both your sons
are eager for your visit."

900
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:55,888
Thanks awfully for having me.

901
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:01,067
It's true, you know,
I do want to go back to the palace.

902
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,645
We talked it over before you came.

903
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:05,782
I do want to.

904
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,649
You don't have to.

905
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,447
I want to.

906
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,330
Please get dressed, come on.

907
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:16,833
Look at you, is this the way
to appear in front of a lady?

908
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,583
You know, he doesn't know what he wants.

909
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:28,052
One day it's this, one day it's that.

910
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:30,223
What can I do?

911
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,842
I've grown fond of him, he's my friend.

912
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:38,563
And once I love a friend
it's for life, forever.

913
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,023
Whatever faults he may have.

914
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:04,441
I'd love to read some Trollope or Dickens.

915
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,938
Lot's of cold, damp, foggy London scenes,

916
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,860
that's what I'm longing for.

917
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,942
Oh, come away, they're all pornographic.

918
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:23,205
It's a princess being got ready
for her nuptial night.

919
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:25,523
They're doing all sorts
of intimate things to her.

920
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,547
Come away.

921
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:34,967
Harry, what is all this about dacoits?

922
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,883
Honestly I don't know, Olivia.

923
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:42,683
A lot of things go on and, quite frankly,
I'd just as soon not know about them.

924
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:45,898
Gosh I feel I awful.

925
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,852
But Harry, doesn't he
ever talk to you about...

926
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:54,988
I hope I'm not disturbing,
please say if I am and I'll run away at once.

927
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,785
How very kind of you to come
and see our poor patient.

928
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,572
How do you find him?
I've sent for Dr Puri.

929
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,329
He's a witch doctor,
please don't bring him near me.

930
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:04,618
Don't be ridiculous.

931
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,003
We want you to get well again quickly.

932
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,506
We miss you. It's very boring
without you, isn't it, Olivia?

933
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,523
She's been asking about the dacoits.

934
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,218
I hope if there's something
you want to know

935
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:23,971
you'll ask me,

936
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,774
not Harry or anybody else, but me.

937
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:30,852
What have you heard?

938
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:32,864
What are they saying?

939
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,407
You must tell me,

940
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:39,361
you must give me a chance to defend myself
against these slanders.

941
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,450
What on Earth are you asking her to do?

942
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,495
Bring you reports
from the Civil Lines at Satipur?

943
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:46,709
Do you want her to be your spy?

944
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:50,459
- I hope you don't think that of me.
- Of course I don't.

945
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,544
I wouldn't for a minute.

946
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:54,880
How could you think it?

947
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:56,719
No, no, I don't.

948
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,552
I know you understand me.

949
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,557
That's why I trust you.

950
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:31,538
- What did they want?
- Protection.

951
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:35,671
It seems that the same gang
who raided that village

952
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:38,420
are now threatening the local traders.

953
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:43,137
Trying to extort money for themselves
and their chief.

954
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:46,394
Who's their chief?

955
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:51,141
Well, we suspect our friend.

956
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:54,110
Do you mean the Nawab?

957
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:58,440
But he's a ruler, he wouldn't get mixed up
with a robber gang.

958
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,233
After all, he's a prince.

959
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,368
Yes, and he's bankrupt,

960
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,030
having bled his unfortunate subject's wife

961
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,995
by means of more or less
legitimate extortion.

962
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:11,127
He's now taken to cruder methods.

963
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:15,415
Not to put too fine a point on it
to outright robbery.

964
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:17,838
I don't believe a word of it.

965
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,429
Must you smoke that dashed thing...

966
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,391
in this heat?

967
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,646
You should've gone to Simla.

968
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:35,561
And do what,
go for walks with Beth Crawford?

969
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:39,947
Go to the same old
boring old dinner parties.

970
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,197
One more of those
and I shall lie down and die.

971
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:49,073
I don't know what's the matter with me.

972
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,329
Why I get so worked up
over every little thing.

973
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:58,083
I told you, it's the heat.

974
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:02,052
No Englishwoman is supposed
to stand this weather.

975
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,055
You have these set notions

976
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,468
about what English women
are supposed to stand.

977
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:11,353
Why should anyone tell me
what I can stand

978
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:12,730
and what I can't stand?

979
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,310
If you really want to know

980
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,488
the one thing I can't
stand is English women.

981
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,032
Memsahibs.

982
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:26,570
But the rest...

983
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,869
I'm so happy here,
I never want to go away.

984
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,511
I wish you would tell Dr Saunders
to go and see Harry

985
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:50,435
at the palace,
he just isn't getting any better.

986
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:52,770
Well...

987
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,641
Dr Saunders doesn't really see
private patients

988
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,271
unless it's one of us.

989
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,442
Isn't in Harry one of us?

990
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:06,909
And if not, am I one of us, do you think?

991
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:18,455
It might even be that
I love you because you're not.

992
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,626
You know sometimes
I wish I could afford some feelings,

993
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,884
because I get hot too, I get angry,
I want to lose my temper, but...

994
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,099
there are always people
watching everywhere.

995
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,480
One simply cannot.

996
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,028
Not even for a minute.

997
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,445
It's a bore I know.

998
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,498
When we have a baby,
I want him to be just like you.

999
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,623
No, no, like you.

1000
01:26:58,922 --> 01:26:59,922
Like Olivia.

1001
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:02,923
Oh, Olivia's no good.

1002
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,506
Oh, don't say that.

1003
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:18,602
Oh, it's all out of tune.

1004
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,520
There's no one to play it.

1005
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,977
I'd ordered it for my wife.

1006
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:25,860
- Did she play?
- She was keen to learn...

1007
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,484
but by the time the piano arrived,
she had left.

1008
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:34,622
I suppose you know about my marriage?

1009
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,199
I've heard.

1010
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,955
Oh yes, of course
you must've heard a lot of things.

1011
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,913
There are always people
to spread lies about me,

1012
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:44,214
including my wife's family.

1013
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:50,130
She was much too young for me, Olivia.

1014
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:54,930
I loved her, as one loves a child.

1015
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,354
Not as I would love a woman.

1016
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,613
What a pity.

1017
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,502
You know, I know what happened,
more or less.

1018
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:27,735
After all, it's quite easy to find out
what a person did, but...

1019
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,941
what made them do it.

1020
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:47,872
I don't know.

1021
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:52,802
I was thinking how India changes people.

1022
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:57,473
Just in subtle ways.

1023
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:00,601
Just by being here.

1024
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,017
I feel you have changed.

1025
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:09,774
But you're still too much
in your head, not in your heart.

1026
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:12,321
I suppose so.

1027
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:14,656
Oh, but I admire you.

1028
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,276
You're so...

1029
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,203
philosophical.

1030
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,324
I don't want to be philosophical.

1031
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,747
Oh, what do you want to be then?

1032
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,755
I don't know, like other people.

1033
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:35,886
You know when you talk like that to me,

1034
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,847
I don't always unders...

1035
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:44,099
I don't always understand you.

1036
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:51,315
But when we are together like this,

1037
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:55,948
I feel you are my very great friend.

1038
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,867
I am your very great friend.

1039
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:23,934
Hello.

1040
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,723
Were you waiting for me?

1041
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,561
I hoped you were.

1042
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,044
You must excuse me, Rivers,
but these people are enough

1043
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:13,900
to drive anyone out of their mind.

1044
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:16,424
They bring me some woman
pretending she's miscarrying

1045
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,690
and when I curette her I discover...

1046
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:24,783
it's always the same, they've aborted her.

1047
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:27,615
They stick this twig into her
and do it with that.

1048
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:30,160
Abortion, mind you, it's a criminal act.

1049
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,335
And then they try to fool me.

1050
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:37,170
I'm sorry you had to come in on this, Rivers,
what can I do for you?

1051
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:42,046
I wanted to ask you a particular favour.

1052
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,799
You know Harry Hamilton-Paul
who's staying at the palace?

1053
01:32:44,851 --> 01:32:46,058
Oh yes, yeah, him.

1054
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,719
He's not very well
and Olivia and I thought that it'd...

1055
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:49,772
Well.

1056
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,751
I wonder what he's been
eating over there.

1057
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:02,904
You see it's question of diet, Nawab Sahib.

1058
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:05,786
I've seen hundreds of cases like this,
thousands.

1059
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:11,201
Did you know that most Indians
suffer from amoebic dysentery, it's a fact.

1060
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:14,620
- Is that true? How interesting.
- They try and cheat you.

1061
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,171
When I say, "What did you eat?"

1062
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,123
They'll say,
"Only what you said Dr Sahib,"

1063
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:19,542
but of course they can't fool me.

1064
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:22,799
"Oh yes, and what about those chilies, hmm?"

1065
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:27,221
"And that curry you've had?
What, you liar, you cheat?"

1066
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:29,427
Sometimes I don't waste any time.

1067
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:31,562
I smartly box their ears,
one, two, one, two.

1068
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,794
- It's the only language they understand.
- You're absolutely right, Dr Saunders.

1069
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:37,561
Well, it's no use arguing with them.
They're not amenable to reason.

1070
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:42,361
They haven't got it here you see, up here,
the way we have.

1071
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,868
He really is exceptionally obnoxious.

1072
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:50,281
- Please don't judge us by him.
- Who's us?

1073
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:53,501
I don't know how you feel about it,
but don't lump me in with that lot.

1074
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,917
Harry, you can't say
the Crawfords are like Dr Saunders,

1075
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,257
or the Minnies,
or for that matter, Douglas.

1076
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,462
And you?

1077
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,385
They're all the same.

1078
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,134
So you do lump me in with them.

1079
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:10,218
You, I wouldn't for a minute,
not for a minute think of you,

1080
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:11,761
speak of you in the same breath.

1081
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:17,441
To me, you're better, beautiful, wonderful,

1082
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,895
more wonderful, absolutely terrific.

1083
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:25,775
- Is that what you wanted to hear?
- Harry, Olivia, look, I mean,

1084
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:29,199
instead of having a rotten time
let's have some fun.

1085
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:34,579
Let me tell you a dream, my dream,
my latest dream, you know.

1086
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,786
I dreamt of Mrs Crawford.

1087
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:41,215
- You dream about Mrs Crawford?
- Not the way you mean, I mean,

1088
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:44,673
Mrs Crawford was not Mrs Crawford.

1089
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:47,505
- She was a hijra.
- What's a hijra?

1090
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:49,799
Oh my poor Olivia, you don't know?

1091
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:51,759
We must educate her.

1092
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,030
At first, she couldn't work out

1093
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:14,118
that these were men, eunuchs.

1094
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:16,201
- Hijra?
- Yes.

1095
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:20,621
It was all so strange
and wonderfully exotic

1096
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:24,300
and she forgot everything,
joined in the fun.

1097
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,336
Forgot herself, you might say.

1098
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:32,368
I kept trying to warn her
but she wouldn't listen.

1099
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:36,242
You see,
she was outraging two conventions,

1100
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:39,833
those of her own people
and those of the Indians,

1101
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:43,622
whose conventions are, if anything,
even stronger

1102
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:46,548
and of course you can't
do anything in India

1103
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,584
without everyone knowing about it,

1104
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:50,381
the servants see to that.

1105
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,466
You know, there's a story
about that old woman

1106
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,856
in the purdah quarters.

1107
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:13,071
How she killed off an unwanted bride

1108
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:16,283
by dressing her up
in poisoned wedding gowns.

1109
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,331
What?

1110
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,115
Apparently it's true.

1111
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:21,075
They dipped the cloth into poison

1112
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:23,835
and then when you put it on
it clings to you.

1113
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:25,079
Frightful.

1114
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:28,465
Oh, there are all sorts of stories
about what goes on in the purdah quarters.

1115
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:31,301
Secret arts, magic potions
and all the rest of it.

1116
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:34,555
Oh, come on now,
those old things in there?

1117
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:37,466
Do they know about me?

1118
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:43,105
Olivia, have you noticed something?

1119
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:45,598
That you're never taken to meet
the begum and the ladies.

1120
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,109
I've met them, thank you.

1121
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,646
It was hard going.

1122
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:54,867
Nevertheless, it's a discourtesy.

1123
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:58,032
- To whom?
- To you, to you my dear.

1124
01:37:58,331 --> 01:38:01,199
Even had a quarrel with him about it,
about you.

1125
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:03,496
- I asked him straight out.
- What?

1126
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,912
Why don't take Olivia,
Mrs Rivers, to meet the begum?

1127
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:09,631
- And he...
- What?

1128
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:13,344
You know what he's like when
he doesn't want to answer something.

1129
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:16,847
He laughs and if you keep on
he makes you feel a fool and prim

1130
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,053
and stupid for asking such a question.

1131
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,267
He's very good at that.

1132
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,271
But Harry, I don't want to meet the begum.

1133
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:26,765
I can't be friends with her, can I?

1134
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:29,401
Not with someone who doesn't
speak the same language.

1135
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:33,689
I enjoy being here with you
and him, of course.

1136
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:35,865
I mean, as your friend.

1137
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:38,322
We have a good time.

1138
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:43,870
Oh, don't look like that, Harry.

1139
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:49,250
Now you're being like everyone else
making me feel I don't understand.

1140
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,157
Olivia, shall I tell you something?

1141
01:38:51,384 --> 01:38:53,376
I don't think you ought to be coming here.

1142
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:56,378
In fact, I wish you wouldn't.

1143
01:38:56,514 --> 01:38:58,881
But Harry, I come to see you.

1144
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:02,393
Of course, naturally, me.

1145
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:53,644
You're awake.

1146
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,400
I saw your light.

1147
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:59,612
It's bad for you to read this late.

1148
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:20,011
I suppose you want to be
my very good friend again.

1149
01:40:20,306 --> 01:40:21,467
Do you mind?

1150
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,943
What a shock he'd have if he knew.

1151
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,108
I was due on the eighth,

1152
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:43,493
the 15th, the 22nd,

1153
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:47,117
that's more than two weeks overdue,
isn't that wonderful?

1154
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:50,292
It's my own fault, I should've taken care.

1155
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:58,170
Thinking again?

1156
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:04,223
On the contrary not thinking at all,
just letting whatever happens happen.

1157
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:43,549
Please wait for me here.

1158
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,929
They still have that tent, Mrs Rivers

1159
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,544
and the blood is so fresh and new
it's as if it had only happened yesterday.

1160
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,671
- Oh.
- Did you have a bad dream?

1161
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,219
- Are they gone?
- Who?

1162
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:27,349
Those men.

1163
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:30,968
Who were they?

1164
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:12,990
I've told Maji about being pregnant.

1165
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:14,454
She's a midwife

1166
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:17,578
and said if I want an abortion
she might try,

1167
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:19,330
with just a massage.

1168
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:23,375
I said "All right let's try".

1169
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:28,760
She said I was about seven weeks gone
so it would be easy now.

1170
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,554
She knew many ways, but at this stage

1171
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:33,681
a simple massage could do it.

1172
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:22,393
No, Maji, no, Maji, no.

1173
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:27,852
I asked her over and over.

1174
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:32,490
"You didn't really do anything, did you?
Nothing will happen?"

1175
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:36,028
And she assured me no, she didn't,
"No, it wouldn't."

1176
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,824
Then she asked me,
"You want the child?"

1177
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:45,454
And I said, "Yes I do, I do."

1178
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:02,478
Darling, Olivia,
are you partaking?

1179
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:07,020
- Major?
- Yes, please.

1180
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:09,696
Well.

1181
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:15,700
To our charming hostess
who has elected to stay with us

1182
01:46:15,744 --> 01:46:18,612
through our ordeal far down in the plague.

1183
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:20,663
Yes, rather.

1184
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:23,001
Here, here.

1185
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:27,545
But Major, aren't you due for
a spot of leave in the hills?

1186
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:31,007
Yes, but this is not the time to go.

1187
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:34,127
Our friend the Nawab
has been acting up again

1188
01:46:34,179 --> 01:46:36,136
and I'm afraid things
are coming to a head.

1189
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:39,474
At present I wouldn't like to be
in that boy's shoes.

1190
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:41,561
Which boy's shoes?

1191
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:43,519
Our friend.

1192
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:47,766
I trust Simla isn't gonna dillydally
any further over him.

1193
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:50,477
It's certainly time
he was taught a lesson.

1194
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:52,570
You talk as if he's a school boy.

1195
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,824
Ah, I wish it were that harmless.

1196
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,276
Olivia, he's a dangerous ruffian.

1197
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:01,947
Those dacoits of his
are running around killing and maiming

1198
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:04,078
with his blessing,
under his protection.

1199
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:07,460
He's a menace to himself, to us,

1200
01:47:08,213 --> 01:47:11,126
and to the wretched inhabitants
of his wretched little state.

1201
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:13,378
He's the worst sort of ruler.

1202
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:16,169
The worst sort of Indian you could have.

1203
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:25,015
Dear lady, are you leaving us?

1204
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,556
To your brandy and cigars.

1205
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:34,654
She's very plucky.

1206
01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:37,441
I believe it went up to 118 today.

1207
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,198
All right Rivers,
better go and see how she is.

1208
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:43,447
Will you mind, sir? I think I ought to.

1209
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:49,828
So, they are setting up
a committee of inquiry?

1210
01:47:50,506 --> 01:47:51,506
Yes.

1211
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:53,877
And I'm rather afraid...

1212
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:57,001
they'll be putting our Nawab
out of business

1213
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:58,303
which is a pity,

1214
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:00,672
because there's no denying he has a quality.

1215
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:02,841
He is a prince.

1216
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:07,395
Yes, but the trouble is, his little state
isn't quite princely enough to satisfy him.

1217
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:11,350
Poor fellow is tremendously bored.

1218
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:14,982
I think he'd do anything to amuse himself.

1219
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:21,119
Olivia.

1220
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:30,044
What is it?

1221
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:33,747
I ought to tell you.

1222
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,041
It isn't just the heat.

1223
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,466
What is it? Tell me.

1224
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:42,932
Are you ill?

1225
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:45,476
Olivia.

1226
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:50,769
The fact is, I'm pregnant.

1227
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:54,694
Darling.

1228
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:59,777
Darling, it's what we want,
more than anything.

1229
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:03,951
Yes, of course it is.

1230
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:33,561
Good morning.

1231
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:37,519
I'll have to keep bringing more Dickens
for Mr Hamilton-Paul.

1232
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:40,776
We're on <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> now.

1233
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:41,908
Ah.

1234
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:45,360
He can't seem to get enough of
foggy London...

1235
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:47,495
...and Christmas revels.

1236
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:52,166
- Isn't it extraordinary?
- Yes indeed, extraordinary.

1237
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:03,428
It was all so murky, both sides intriguing.

1238
01:50:03,764 --> 01:50:07,804
The British too,
they were playing their own game,

1239
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:09,475
they always did.

1240
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:14,598
They'd set up some sort of
committee to depose him.

1241
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:19,728
"Put him out of business"
was the facetious phrase they used.

1242
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:28,112
And, for his successor,
they'd picked out some halfwit,

1243
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:30,200
epileptic nephew.

1244
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:33,871
He was the son of the Nawab's sister.

1245
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:38,289
That of course was because
the Nawab had no son of his own.

1246
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:41,799
As it turned out in the end

1247
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:46,550
it was more convenient to drop the nephew
than simply to swallow up the whole state

1248
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:48,590
into British India.

1249
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:52,727
How dare they appoint anyone
to inquire into my activities.

1250
01:50:53,230 --> 01:50:55,643
I told him. I told your Major Minnies.

1251
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:56,732
Why mine?

1252
01:50:57,693 --> 01:51:00,026
No, of course not,
you have nothing to do with it.

1253
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:04,906
Anyway I made it very clear that from now
I shall deal with the viceroy, personally.

1254
01:51:05,367 --> 01:51:06,608
I told him.

1255
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:08,735
I don't deal with underlings Major Minnies.

1256
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:10,865
I know what this is all about.

1257
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:16,122
I know why they hate me,
because I don't say, "Yes, Your Excellency."

1258
01:51:16,378 --> 01:51:17,914
"Very good, Your Excellency."

1259
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:19,792
"How right and true, Your Excellency."

1260
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,206
I have something to tell you.

1261
01:51:21,383 --> 01:51:22,383
What is it?

1262
01:51:25,596 --> 01:51:27,929
What is it? Tell me.

1263
01:51:30,142 --> 01:51:31,258
Can't you guess?

1264
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:35,602
I'm pregnant.

1265
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:54,989
You're made to bear a child.

1266
01:51:57,961 --> 01:51:59,202
Are you afraid?

1267
01:52:02,007 --> 01:52:03,373
Don't be afraid.

1268
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:07,377
Now they'll see.

1269
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:12,306
- Who'll see?
- Major Minnies and the rest of them.

1270
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:15,806
They'll laugh out of the other sides
of their mouths

1271
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,345
when they see my son.

1272
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:20,728
Do you mean because...

1273
01:52:21,902 --> 01:52:23,109
of the colour?

1274
01:52:23,195 --> 01:52:26,484
Oh, they'll get the shock
of their little English lives.

1275
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:28,491
No, no.

1276
01:52:29,785 --> 01:52:31,026
You mustn't go.

1277
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:36,122
I want you to stay here, you must.

1278
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:40,168
My son must be born here in my house.

1279
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:43,459
How can you be so sure?

1280
01:52:44,633 --> 01:52:47,467
I'm very sure, absolutely.

1281
01:52:48,262 --> 01:52:49,298
He's mine.

1282
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,088
He couldn't not be.

1283
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:53,927
What about Douglas?

1284
01:52:57,187 --> 01:53:01,602
He's as sure as you are,
and he's my husband.

1285
01:53:10,867 --> 01:53:12,324
What have I done?

1286
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:16,324
What have I done?

1287
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:25,588
What have <i>you</i> made me do?

1288
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:42,605
How do you know it'll be a he?

1289
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:44,523
Oh, I'm pretty sure.

1290
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:48,149
And he'll do something
decent too, you'll see.

1291
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:53,442
I must ask my sister to send
the Rivers' christening robe.

1292
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:56,194
All the Rivers babies are christened in it.

1293
01:53:58,749 --> 01:54:00,081
You know, they're all very blond.

1294
01:54:01,126 --> 01:54:03,584
We all have white blond hair
'til we're about 12.

1295
01:54:07,382 --> 01:54:08,623
Look, I'm sorry.

1296
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,593
What a stupid ass I am to bring you here.

1297
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:15,888
We won't come back again.

1298
01:54:17,434 --> 01:54:18,720
Come on darling, let's go.

1299
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,037
I can hardly find
an abortionist for you.

1300
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:42,616
Ask your friends
in the purdah quarters.

1301
01:54:44,795 --> 01:54:46,002
Ask the begum.

1302
01:54:47,381 --> 01:54:49,589
It'll be easy enough for her.

1303
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:56,759
Easier than poisoned garments
any day.

1304
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:03,511
I couldn't refuse her.

1305
01:55:03,855 --> 01:55:07,064
I didn't want to see this baby born
any more than she did.

1306
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:11,645
No one did, except the Nawab and Douglas.

1307
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:16,027
The begum was glad to help.

1308
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:19,740
She wanted no complications
with the British on the one hand

1309
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:23,532
nor did she fancy a little Eurasian heir.

1310
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:27,160
Of course, there had to be
the utmost secrecy

1311
01:55:27,379 --> 01:55:29,541
because if the Nawab had ever found out

1312
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:31,748
he'd have killed someone.

1313
01:55:31,883 --> 01:55:35,467
He believed 'til the end
that it was a natural miscarriage.

1314
01:56:06,501 --> 01:56:08,959
HARRY She had begun to bleed
the same night

1315
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:10,752
and Douglas took her to the hospital.

1316
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:13,505
Well, my young madam.

1317
01:56:14,593 --> 01:56:17,711
But Dr Saunders
was all too familiar with the methods

1318
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:21,093
used by Indian midwives
to procure abortions.

1319
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:26,101
I never knew how she got
from the hospital to the palace.

1320
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:28,475
A distance of nine miles.

1321
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,683
And she could hardly have walked it
in the middle of the night

1322
01:56:31,776 --> 01:56:36,020
and her condition with all that
loss of blood from her abortion.

1323
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:40,654
She'd borrowed some servant's
sari in the hospital.

1324
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:43,907
She reminded me of one
of those mutiny prints.

1325
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:49,334
I think it's called "Mrs Secombe
In Flight from the Mutineers".

1326
01:56:50,253 --> 01:56:52,495
Now Mrs Secombe was also in native dress

1327
01:56:52,547 --> 01:56:54,254
and in a state of agitation.

1328
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:56,798
Olivia was in flight as well,

1329
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:00,048
but of course, in the opposite direction,

1330
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:02,839
from the civil station at Satipur

1331
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:04,970
to the Nawab's palace at Khatm.

1332
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:32,285
Chid, you look absolutely awful.

1333
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:34,412
I think I'm gonna die.

1334
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:39,084
His liver's affected.

1335
01:57:42,389 --> 01:57:44,722
And his kidneys too, sit up.

1336
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:48,141
What does he expect?

1337
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:51,353
Even I wouldn't think of eating and living
the way he has done.

1338
01:57:55,277 --> 01:57:57,769
My prescription for him
is to put him on the next plane home

1339
01:57:57,821 --> 01:57:59,403
and the sooner the better.

1340
01:58:03,827 --> 01:58:07,946
My dear young man, your body's not made
to live the life of a holy man.

1341
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:12,541
Psst. Let's go.

1342
01:58:14,546 --> 01:58:16,253
What about you, when are you going?

1343
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,423
Don't know, I haven't made any plans.

1344
01:58:19,467 --> 01:58:20,958
When my money runs out I suppose.

1345
01:58:21,886 --> 01:58:24,970
I'm staying with my Aunt
Betty in Iowa, Washington Iowa.

1346
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:27,552
It's the cleanest city in the whole USA.

1347
01:58:27,934 --> 01:58:29,800
It's a fact, it won a prize for it.

1348
01:58:31,605 --> 01:58:33,221
You should see my Aunt Betty's bathroom.

1349
01:58:33,648 --> 01:58:37,688
Everything matches, the shower curtain,
the bath mat, the toilet paper,

1350
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:39,894
the little woolly cover on the toilet seat.

1351
01:58:42,198 --> 01:58:43,734
Everything's green.

1352
01:58:44,492 --> 01:58:45,733
Clean fresh green.

1353
01:58:46,244 --> 01:58:47,610
Have a safe journey.

1354
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:51,698
If you think the bathrooms clean,
you ought to see the kitchen!

1355
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:55,202
- Take care.
- Everything's clean fresh green!

1356
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:59,167
Goodbye, Chid, bye bye.

1357
01:59:19,903 --> 01:59:22,441
I knew she was rotten
from the first day I saw her.

1358
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:25,113
Well she wasn't a bad sort,
just the wrong type to come out here.

1359
01:59:25,367 --> 01:59:27,324
Her embroidery and her piano.

1360
01:59:27,702 --> 01:59:30,035
That's all very nice at home,
it'll hardly due for Satipur.

1361
01:59:31,122 --> 01:59:32,784
She killed her own baby.

1362
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:36,497
- Oh come, come, Joan.
- She could have a baby,

1363
01:59:36,628 --> 01:59:37,664
and she killed it.

1364
01:59:37,921 --> 01:59:40,664
Don't forget, my dear, whose baby it was.

1365
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,706
What does that matter
as long as...

1366
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:45,926
as long as she cared for him?

1367
01:59:46,846 --> 01:59:49,839
I just can't stop thinking about it.

1368
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:55,428
Come along, Joan,
it's time I got you home.

1369
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,306
Bed for you, my dear.

1370
01:59:59,025 --> 02:00:00,311
Those are doctor's orders.

1371
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:03,023
- Goodnight, goodnight.
- Goodnight Joan.

1372
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:04,941
Now you take good care of yourself, Joan.

1373
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:06,814
I will, thank you.

1374
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:09,158
- Goodnight.
- Night.

1375
02:00:14,791 --> 02:00:19,627
Well, she may have cared for him,
but I don't think that your precious Nawab

1376
02:00:19,671 --> 02:00:20,957
has returned the compliment.

1377
02:00:21,005 --> 02:00:24,248
What a bounder to have taken his revenge
in that way.

1378
02:00:24,342 --> 02:00:27,631
- Was it only revenge?
- Do you doubt it?

1379
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,297
No, I suppose not, not really.

1380
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:33,925
How is Rivers taking it?

1381
02:00:34,561 --> 02:00:36,302
Like a Stoic and a Roman.

1382
02:00:36,688 --> 02:00:38,429
He's a splendid chap.

1383
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:41,290
I've sent him on tour to get him away
from this place for a while.

1384
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:43,392
He picked the wrong girl.

1385
02:00:44,529 --> 02:00:46,862
I'm so immensely fond of him,
I wish I could...

1386
02:00:47,615 --> 02:00:49,527
What, match-making already?

1387
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:52,196
Oh, my dear man,
that's what a burra memsahib's for.

1388
02:00:54,706 --> 02:00:55,867
Poor Olivia.

1389
02:00:57,917 --> 02:00:59,658
She was a fine looking girl, too.

1390
02:01:00,253 --> 02:01:02,745
Was? She's not dead.

1391
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,251
As good as.

1392
02:02:53,324 --> 02:02:55,684
The Chowkidar told me that a long time ago

1393
02:02:55,743 --> 02:02:57,325
an English memsahib lived here.

1394
02:02:58,121 --> 02:03:01,455
She lived completely alone, then she died.

1395
02:03:02,584 --> 02:03:04,416
That was 20 or 30 years ago.

1396
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:07,916
Now the house belongs to
the Nawab's great nephew

1397
02:03:08,298 --> 02:03:09,880
who's a general in the Indian army.

1398
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,917
He comes here every summer
with his family.

1399
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:35,322
He came out to see her
about two or three times a year.

1400
02:03:35,783 --> 02:03:37,900
The rest of the time
he was mostly in London

1401
02:03:38,036 --> 02:03:40,824
trying to get his deposition annulled.

1402
02:03:41,164 --> 02:03:43,201
His mother came to live in London, too.

1403
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:47,118
She bought a house in Park Lane,
which they've since pulled down.

1404
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:52,252
It was said that she'd taken
the state jewels with her,

1405
02:03:52,759 --> 02:03:54,216
but it could never be proved,

1406
02:03:54,594 --> 02:03:57,132
nor could they get a single pearl
away from her.

1407
02:03:57,805 --> 02:04:00,889
They tried to bring a case against her,
but to no avail.

1408
02:04:01,517 --> 02:04:04,385
Except every time a summons came,

1409
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:07,062
the Nawab got himself worked up.

1410
02:04:07,148 --> 02:04:09,310
He'd roar and stamp around.

1411
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:16,357
Then one day, quite suddenly,
in his mother's flat, just like that.

1412
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,970
I don't know how long it was

1413
02:04:19,994 --> 02:04:22,987
before news reached her that
he wouldn't be coming anymore.

1414
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:26,953
Even after she knew,
she never went down again

1415
02:04:27,001 --> 02:04:29,744
but stayed by herself in the house
he had bought for her.

1416
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:23,847
Namaste.

1417
02:05:27,061 --> 02:05:28,518
The monastery?

1418
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:31,976
Would you like me
to take you over there?

1419
02:05:32,025 --> 02:05:33,106
Are you going?

1420
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:35,234
- Yes, I am going there.
- Thank you.

1421
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:36,981
May I help you to...

1422
02:05:42,035 --> 02:05:44,013
They have a little hospital up here.

1423
02:05:44,037 --> 02:05:46,654
That's where Olivia went in the end.

1424
02:05:46,998 --> 02:05:49,490
They've agreed to let me
come there for my baby.
