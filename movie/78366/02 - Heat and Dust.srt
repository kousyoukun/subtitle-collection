1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,620
In a far corner of the Earth

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,460
is a South American wilderness.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,620
These extreme landscapes
are home to strange

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,660
and wonderful animals.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,740
GENTLE ROAR

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,460
From the rugged peaks of The Andes...

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,460
..across the scorched
desert steppe...

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,980
..to coasts battered by some of
the roughest seas on the planet.

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,020
Living here takes guts
and determination.

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,740
There are incredible opportunities
for some.

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,580
For others, it's a battle to survive.

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,420
The pioneering spirit unites them all

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,100
under the spell...

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,700
..of Patagonia.

15
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,300
Patagonia is a land of two extremes.

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,300
The west is a lush wonderland.

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,180
But the east is a different story.

18
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,460
A world battered by the wind.

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,260
Then baked by the sun.

20
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,060
This is a journey that
blows from the Andes mountains

21
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,660
to the Atlantic coast.

22
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,580
Through Patagonia's
increasingly tough desert,

23
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,460
where life copes by reinventing
itself in weird and unique ways.

24
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,540
An Andean condor.

25
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580
One of the heaviest
flying birds in the world.

26
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,580
Held aloft on huge wings.

27
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,940
Three metres from tip to tip.

28
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,460
Making the most of Patagonia's
powerful winds.

29
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,780
Winds borne far out to sea.

30
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,300
Driving across
thousands of miles of ocean.

31
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,740
Laden with moisture,
they race towards Patagonia.

32
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,740
And crash into a formidable barrier.

33
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,340
The Andes mountains.

34
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,380
WIND GUSTS

35
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,660
These high peaks strip the clouds
of virtually all their moisture.

36
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,820
Over three trillion tonnes of fresh
water locked up in glaciers...

37
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,860
..going nowhere.

38
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
The winds still blow,

39
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,100
but now they're freezing cold
and very dry.

40
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,020
They sweep eastwards
from the Andes...

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,940
..on a journey towards
the Atlantic coast.

42
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,540
WIND GUSTS

43
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,820
The winds blow so fiercely
that those who live here

44
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,580
call them La Escoba de Dios -
The Broom of God.

45
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,420
In the foothills, the world
they create is like no other.

46
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,340
Open moorlands bustling with life.

47
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,860
And unexpected wandering herds.

48
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,020
A male guanaco,
wild ancestor of the llama.

49
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,780
At this time of the year,
his main concern

50
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,420
is keeping an eye on his harem.

51
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,660
Young bachelors are intent
on stealing his females.

52
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,500
GUANACO BLEATS

53
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,020
On the edge of the herd,
one female has concerns of her own.

54
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,860
Giving birth to a calf

55
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,300
with legs nearly a metre long.

56
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,900
GENTLE BLEATING

57
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,860
Whist Dad is preoccupied
with the bachelors,

58
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,700
a grey fox is taking an interest.

59
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,700
Mum takes no chances.

60
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,260
The new addition takes
its first faltering steps.

61
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,980
Joining the family herd.

62
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,140
Even Dad is curious.

63
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,660
After giving birth,
the females quickly become fertile.

64
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,140
They must mate again soon -

65
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,900
and the bachelors know it.

66
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,820
The male's entire harem
is now at stake.

67
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,500
One bachelor makes his move.

68
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,460
The female spits her disapproval.

69
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,580
The male leaps into action.

70
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,260
FIERCE BLEATING

71
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,300
Using razor-sharp teeth...

72
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,060
..he aims for
his challenger's testicles.

73
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,100
An emasculating bite.

74
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,900
Necks are protected by
specially thickened skin.

75
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,100
These fights have no rules.

76
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,540
The battles are exhausting.

77
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,740
The challenger is driven off.

78
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,500
His masculinity intact, the male
enjoys the rewards whilst he can.

79
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,100
As the wind barrels
across the slopes,

80
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,620
it is twisted into ephemeral spirals.

81
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,140
Spinning Patagonia's
mysterious flying saucers -

82
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,460
lenticular clouds constantly whipped
by the swirling winds.

83
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,100
On the ground below, the challenge
is how to cheat the wind.

84
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,540
The stunted vegetation
is sculpted and armoured.

85
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,420
BIRDSONG

86
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,980
But under its protection,
delicate flowers bloom,

87
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,620
hidden from the shredding blasts.

88
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,260
This is gavilea,
a southern specialist.

89
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,420
An Andean sweet pea,

90
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,860
its fragile petals
saved from the wind.

91
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,780
And the porcelain orchid,

92
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,820
named after the delicate cracks
that adorn its petals.

93
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,220
It relishes these cold conditions.

94
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,700
These spirited blooms each exploit
a chink in the hostile climate.

95
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,220
And it's not just the flowers
that are keeping their heads down.

96
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,980
BIRDSONG

97
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,100
On the edge of this lake,
one bush looks a little different.

98
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,260
Darwin's rhea -

99
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,100
Patagonia's largest bird.

100
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,660
Like the bushes around,

101
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,860
it's hunkered down to avoid
the worst of the icy wind...

102
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,580
..keeping something precious warm.

103
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,420
A clutch of up to 50 eggs,

104
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,460
each ten times the size
of a hen's egg.

105
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,300
But this isn't Mum -
this is a dedicated father.

106
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,620
These eggs were laid by many mothers,

107
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,940
but they all have a single father,

108
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,460
and he's now incubating them alone.

109
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,540
For 40 days, he will barely eat
or drink as his clutch develops.

110
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,100
When dads can finally
stretch their legs,

111
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,300
they stride out with family in tow.

112
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,100
Four rhea chicks, all sporting
a mint humbug camouflage.

113
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,900
In a rhea's world,
it's all about growing up fast.

114
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,140
Building up fat reserves
to insulate against the cruel winds.

115
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,900
Plants, insects
and even lizards are all snapped up.

116
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,300
They'll grow to Dad's three-feet
height in just over eight months.

117
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,460
Whilst the chicks can hardly see
over the grass...

118
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,300
..Dad's long neck allows him
to keep an eye out for danger.

119
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,380
With Dad on the lookout,
the chicks can get back to

120
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,980
eating their way through
the Patagonian scrub.

121
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,380
A flightless single father
is unusual for a bird.

122
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,020
But in Patagonia, those that survive
often find unexpected solutions

123
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,700
to the challenges they face.

124
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,420
Small pools dot the foothills,

125
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,260
formed from the meagre winter snow.

126
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,020
They provide a refuge
for an unlikely wanderer.

127
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,580
Chilean flamingos.

128
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,300
Flamboyant and seemingly fragile,

129
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,820
they are, in fact, hardy nomads,

130
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,140
living over 50 years.

131
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,740
After a freezing night,
ice has formed on the water.

132
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,380
Soon, they won't be able to feed,

133
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,500
so they must leave
before they become trapped.

134
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,580
Flamingos can travel over 300 miles
in a day, looking for a new lake.

135
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,340
But as they head east,
away from the mountains,

136
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,420
not any old lake will do.

137
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
It must be shallow.

138
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,220
Salty, but not too much.

139
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,140
Ideally warm, getting lots of sun.

140
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,060
Then, like this lake,

141
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,140
it will be teeming with the tiny
crustaceans the flamingos eat...

142
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,060
..which give their feathers
such dramatic colour.

143
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,420
Their tongues pump vast quantities
of water through their bills,

144
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,660
sieving out the microscopic food.

145
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,940
Filtering the lake
as fast as they can.

146
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,380
It's essential, as they can't bank on
where they'll find their next meal.

147
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,660
The winds are still blowing,

148
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,060
but now the powers of the wind
and the sun combine.

149
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,660
Together,
they start to strangle the lake.

150
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,300
As it evaporates,
its chemistry changes,

151
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,100
gradually killing off
the flamingos' food.

152
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,980
Tempers begin to flare.

153
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,500
Once again, they must leave

154
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,380
and resume their search
for the next perfect lake,

155
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,700
racing the power of the sun.

156
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,380
Ahead of the flamingos,
everything changes.

157
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,660
The foothills give way
to the Patagonian Steppe.

158
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,780
A vast landscape
nearly 300,000 square miles,

159
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,060
three times the size of Britain.

160
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,300
East of here, the wind is warmer
and the sun hotter,

161
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,020
and the more difficult life becomes.

162
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,900
The soils here are too dry for trees.

163
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,060
Instead,
another plant has the upper hand.

164
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,740
This is the kingdom of grasses.

165
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,980
Over 50 species.

166
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,700
Tough, shiny leaves
defy the bone-dry wind.

167
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,980
The first Europeans to see this land
weren't so impressed.

168
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,220
Even Charles Darwin said it was
"wretched and useless".

169
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,540
But this land is very good
for something.

170
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,540
These grasslands produce
some of the finest wool in the world,

171
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,740
from some of the finest sheep
in the world.

172
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,500
The merino.

173
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,900
Patagonia's dry air
keeps the sheep cleaner.

174
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,500
Their whiter fleeces are prized
by the fashion houses of Europe.

175
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,860
Once a year, Patagonia's
eight million sheep are rounded up.

It's been said that the culture
and economy here

179
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,340
is built on a sheep's back.

180
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,540
As the gauchos bring in the sheep...

181
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,820
..the shearers are on their way.

182
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,980
They travel the Steppe,
living, sleeping

183
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,180
and eating together
for months on end.

184
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,540
Cesar Gueide has been shearing sheep
for 25 years.

WIND WHISTLES

193
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,180
Making a living in these rolling
grasslands is all about

194
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,700
being part of a community.

195
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,540
They all seek a home out of the wind.

196
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,180
The architect of all this
is the big, hairy armadillo.

197
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,620
ARMADILLO SNIFFS

198
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
He scratches a living
searching for grubs

199
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,820
and beetle larvae hidden underground.

200
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,700
His sense of smell is acute.

201
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,540
He can detect food buried
under 50 centimetres of soil.

202
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,340
Inside his nose are special filters
to keep out the dust.

203
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,980
He can breathe
where others would suffocate.

204
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,500
He works his way around the Steppe...

205
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,780
..excavating as he goes.

206
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,340
While he does, others are taking
advantage of his tunnelling skills.

207
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,060
A burrowing owl.

208
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,460
And his mate.

209
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,140
With no trees for shelter, the Steppe
wind drives them underground.

210
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,220
So an old armadillo burrow
makes for a snug home.

211
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,460
They have a strong, lifelong bond.

212
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,220
But their domestic bliss
is threatened

213
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,460
by nightmare neighbours.

214
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,300
Maras.

215
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,140
Perhaps Patagonia's oddest animal.

216
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,820
It's like a guinea pig on stilts.

217
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,780
Patagonia's answer to an antelope.

218
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,620
She's also looking for a burrow.

219
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,900
But they're in short supply -

220
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,540
so the maras take them by force.

221
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,780
That doesn't go down well
with the owls.

222
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,820
They're only eight inches tall,
but don't give up without a fight.

223
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,340
There's a lot at stake
for the mara, too.

224
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,020
She needs the armadillo's burrow
just as much -

225
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,660
for her pups.

226
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,900
This one's only a day old.

227
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,740
He was born eyes wide open
and fully furred.

228
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,340
He'll share this nursery
with up to 40 others.

229
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,700
Burrows are vital to his survival.

230
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,780
Whilst his parents
can sprint from danger,

231
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,340
his only defence
is to dive underground.

232
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,660
Today,
the community's a hive of activity.

233
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,340
The maras graze,

234
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,940
the armadillos trundle about...

235
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,420
..and the owls...well,
they take it easy.

236
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,100
And for the newborn,
it's time to play.

237
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,980
HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL

238
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,140
Before long, the pups are hungry.

239
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,260
Each mother only feeds her own.

240
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,820
Their smell is unique,
so she sniffs each one.

241
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,460
But the others still try their luck.

242
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,860
So every female
is harassed by hungry mouths.

243
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,820
HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL

244
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,500
The newborn joins in -
but he's in for a shock.

245
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,460
He tries again and again.

246
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,620
But female after female
drives him away.

247
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,540
HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL

248
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,820
Desperate for a meal,

249
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,820
he tries one last time.

250
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,500
And his courage is rewarded.

251
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,820
This is HIS mother.

252
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,140
This community's success goes to show
that with a little help,

253
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,980
you can make a home in the Steppe.

254
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,740
These rugged landscapes have,
over the years,

255
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,780
attracted people seeking freedom
and a fresh start.

256
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,820
The original Patagonians were nomads,

257
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,660
but the new settlers
wanted to put down roots.

258
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,740
In 1865, Welsh pioneers set up
a new homeland along the rivers.

259
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,100
This was to be a Welsh utopia,
far from English influence.

260
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,820
By pulling together,
this fledgling community, 153 strong,

261
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,700
made farmsteads from the wilderness.

262
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,900
Life was tough,

263
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,780
but they had a lifeline that kept
their remote settlements together.

264
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,180
It still does today.

265

Better known
as the Patagonian Express -

268
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,940
a steam train in miniature.

TRAIN WHISTLE

270
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,740
La Trochita was built
to open up the Steppe.

271
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,580
A vital link,
transporting settlers in

272
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,620
and wool and livestock
out to the coast.

273
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,780
It's still going strong,

274
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,380
lovingly maintained by Carlos Kmet
and his team.

276
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,300
Even with La Trochita,

277
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,980
the Steppe remains one of the most
sparsely populated places on Earth.

278

Carlos relishes his link

TRAIN WHISTLE

280
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,820
La Trochita survived,

281
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,260
but the unpredictable climate
really tested new settlers.

282
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,380
In 1902, the famous bank robbers
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid

283
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,940
escaped here to invest their loot.

284
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,580
Butch declared, "This part of
the country looks so good,

285
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,620
"I like the place better every day".

286
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,780
But life proved too tough.

287
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,020
After just five years,
they packed it in -

288
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,060
only to die in a Bolivian shootout.

289
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,900
Monuments to failed ventures
still haunt the Steppe today.

290
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,780
Halfway across the Steppe,
the winds begin to lose their power.

291
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,940
The sun takes control.

292
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Success in the stifling heat

293
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,260
depends on the ability
to seize the day.

294
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,980
One creature is determined
not to miss his chance.

295
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,460
Patagonia's male wandering tarantulas
are searching for love.

296
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,380
This male's spent four years
reaching maturity.

297
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,420
But in two months, he'll be dead.

298
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,420
He's in a serious hurry.

299
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,540
He'll barely eat or sleep.

300
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,100
This is what he's looking for.

301
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,700
Silken threads left by a female.

302
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,420
Impregnated with her pheromones,

303
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,980
chemical love letters
advertising her availability.

304
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,620
They lead him to her lair.

305
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,100
She can live for 30 years.

306
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,140
She's seen many suitors in the past.

307
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,660
He taps a seductive rhythm
to tempt her out.

308
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,340
She replies.

309
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,060
For him,
this is a very dangerous liaison.

310
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,180
He eyes her up.

311
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,620
If he's not her type, she'll eat him.

312
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,420
But this male
has a talent for seduction.

313
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,580
He tenderly stokes her body.

314
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,300
She relaxes, opening her fangs,

315
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,460
allowing him to move closer.

316
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,180
He carefully delivers
his packet of sperm.

317
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,300
During mating, the female
falls into a trance-like state.

318
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,180
She stays like this
for several minutes.

319
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,380
He has to make a quick getaway
before it wears off.

320
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,180
For tarantulas, lingering goodbyes
are generally fatal.

321
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,860
The winds are coming to
the end of their journey,

322
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,020
reaching the edge of the continent.

323
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,060
Yet here,

324
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,700
Patagonia is at its most brutal.

325
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,940
This is a true desert,

326
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,620
and also Patagonia's
most mysterious landscape.

327
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,740
For most of the year,
there's not a drop of rain.

328
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,060
It's so hot and arid
little can survive here today.

329
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,540
But this was once a lush forest.

330
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,860
It's littered with tree trunks
now long dead.

331
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,300
Over millions of years,
they've been petrified.

332
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,180
Turned to stone.

333
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,100
They're evidence that the steppe
was once far wetter.

334
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,220
But that changed catastrophically.

335
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,900
Seven million years ago,

336
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,900
the rising Andes mountains
reached their full height.

337
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,260
The mountain stole the rain,

338
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,220
transforming Patagonia's climate
for ever.

339
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,940
A reminder that entire worlds
can be snuffed out

340
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,420
when the elemental forces of nature
collide.

341
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,860
Within touching distance
of the Atlantic,

342
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,900
Patagonia's desert
is at its most extreme.

343
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,660
Yet life triumphs even here.

344
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,060
Not a mirage -

345
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,300
a penguin.

346
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,980
She's on a mission,

347
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,020
walking deeper into the desert.

348
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,300
Her lifelong mate is waiting for her.

349
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,460
Just one couple in the largest
penguin colony in South America.

350
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,580
Magellanic penguins,

351
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,300
over half a million of them.

352
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,780
So the competition for burrows
often boils over.

353
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,420
Magellanics have short fuses.

354
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,100
They aim for bare patches of skin

355
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,780
where blood vessels
are closest to the surface.

356
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,900
The damage looks worse than it is,

357
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,060
but he'll think twice
before stealing another's burrow.

358
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,540
This couple have come to the desert
for one reason -

359
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,180
the dry air.

360
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,780
Their new chicks are covered
in a fluffy layer of down.

361
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,060
Despite the searing day,

362
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,340
nights are cold,

363
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,380
so the down is essential for warmth.

364
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,900
But if it gets wet,

365
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,300
the chicks will chill and die.

366
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,620
So everyone suffers in the heat.

367
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,980
Each day, their parents take turns
trudging to the sea

368
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,980
across a mile of desert.

369
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,540
Dad's feet are leathery -

370
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,540
protection from the burning sand.

371
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,980
Finally.

372
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,660
The ocean is a welcome relief.

373
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,420
He'll swim miles out to sea,

374
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,980
fishing tirelessly
for over eight hours.

375
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,020
Back at the burrow,

376
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,340
it's tough for Mum.

377
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,820
With her thick feathers
and a layer of fat,

378
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,900
she's in danger of overheating.

379
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,100
But, despite the heat,

380
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,740
she can't doze off.

381
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,700
The colony is not safe.

382
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,100
Kelp gulls.

383
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,940
They skulk around the colony

384
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,820
searching every burrow

385
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,820
looking for unattended chicks.

386
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,140
They won't try anything
with Mum around.

387
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,660
The gulls keep her on her toes,

388
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,700
but the main threat to her chicks

389
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,940
is the desert itself.

390
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,940
Their only source of water's
within the food

391
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,100
their parents bring back
from the sea.

392
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,660
Around them, the gulls are making
the most of early casualties.

393
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,940
But these chicks are lucky.

394
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,140
Dad emerges from the dust,

395
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,460
his stomach full of fish and squid.

396
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,420
Food and drink in one gulp.

397
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,420
For this couple,

398
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,540
100 days of trudging the desert
lie ahead,

399
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:08,060
before their chicks are old enough
to leave the colony,

400
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,820
heading out to spend winter at sea,

401
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,100
saying goodbye to Patagonia

402
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,700
for another year.

403
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:31,540
The theft of rains by the Andes
mountains may have destroyed a world,

404
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,980
but, in doing so,

405
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,380
it has created a new one.

406
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,300
A windswept land to the east...

407
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,900
..an arid world of plucky
and adaptable survivors...

408
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,900
..pioneers who take on a punishing
combination of elements

409
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,340
and, against all the odds,

410
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,780
they triumph.

411
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:18,060
Patagonia has a rugged beauty,

412
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:22,140
and the jewel in its crown
is Torres del Paine,

413
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,940
famous for its iconic granite towers.

414
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,740
It's where the Patagonia team
have come to film two creatures

415
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,340
during the brief spring.

416
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,540
Their aim is to capture
the birth of a wanako

417
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,620
and a rhea father with
his newly-hatched chicks

418
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,100
and, to do so, they turn to
the people who know Torres best,

419
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,900
Chilean film-makers
Christian Munoz-Donoso

420
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,540
and his son Christiaan Munoz Salas,

421
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,180
also known as Doco.

422
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,060
They would each take on
one of these challenges.

423
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,940
With Doco is director Hannah Hawe.

424
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,140
Their mission was the rhea family.

425
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,220
Rheas are massive.
They're Patagonia's biggest birds.

426
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,860
I just didn't think it would be
that hard to find them.

427
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,620
But I hadn't really banked
on the scale of the landscape.

428
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,980
It's just vast, and rheas
are incredibly well-camouflaged.

429
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,580
They just vanish.

430
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,260
From a distance,
every rock looks like a rhea.

431
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,540
They needed extra help,
so local rancher Juan led them

432
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,980
to the spots he knew.

433
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,900
So, Juan is just going to check
the route ahead for us.

434
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,300
There's a bit of a, er...

435
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,580
Well, from here,
it looks like a bit of a cliff.

436
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,620
He's just going to check
if there's a route down.

437
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,780
It's his land, so...

438
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,940
..whatever he says goes.

439
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,780
It's not his car, however.

440
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,300
Ooh!

441
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,220
CAR DOOR SLAMS

442
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,380
BIRDSONG

443
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,260
Finally, a rhea.

444
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,500
But too far away.

445
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,340
And not stopping.

446
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,740
Rheas run at nearly 40mph.

447
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,700
BIRDSONG

448
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,620
But if the rheas
were proving difficult,

449
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,620
the guanaco team seemed
to have the harder mission -

450
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,380
to film a mother giving birth.

451
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,540
Very soon, they saw a welcome sight.

452
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,220
Getting close wasn't the problem.

453
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,060
But they'd missed the birth,
and only by minutes.

454
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,420
But for the rhea team, Patagonia
had unleashed its powerful winds.

455
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,620
They're called the Broom of God.

456
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,540
Gusting over 100mph...

457
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,700
..and making filming impossible.

458
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,620
WIND ROARS

459
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,180
I can't...
I genuinely can't stand up!

460
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,180
HE LAUGHS

461
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,900
WIND ROARS AND WHISTLES

462
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,540
HE LAUGHS

463
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,300
HE EXHALES DEEPLY

464
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,260
CAR ENGINE WHIRS

465
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,300
The next day, the wind dropped.

466
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,940
The rhea team had a new lead.

467
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,140
But Christiaan had a word of warning
before they went their separate ways.

468
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,780
HE CHUCKLES

469
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:40,300
Like any father, Christiaan
was concerned for their safety.

470
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,340
If we encounter pumas, what...
What's the protocol?

471
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,980
THEY LAUGH

472
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,700
OK.

473
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,220
Bye.

474
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,700
Off we go.

475
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,540
Puma country.

476
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,620
Hyunh!

477
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,220
I'm sticking with you, Doco.

478
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,220
SHE CHUCKLES

479
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,340
Here is...

480
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,260
..the first sign I've got
that we are...

481
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,060
definitely in puma country.
Not much left of that.

482
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,140
I guess that was a guanaco.

483
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,340
Finally, a rhea that was staying put.

484
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:52,380
But as soon as we found the rhea,
I forgot about the pumas.

485
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,060
It was the closest
we'd managed to get to one.

486
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,500
He was sitting on a nest
and he wasn't going anywhere.

487
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,940
He just sat tight on that nest.

488
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,780
And we just had to do the same.

489
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,500
BIRDSONG

490
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,060
They needed this dad to have
chicks beneath those feathers.

491
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,700
After five hours, he stood,

492
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,580
only to reveal that
there were no chicks, just eggs.

493
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,860
And rheas can sit on their eggs
for five weeks before they hatch.

494
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,500
It was disappointing.

495
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,380
We just didn't have time to sit
with him and wait for them to hatch.

496
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,180
It was really gutting.

497
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,460
But we had to move on.

498
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,500
Down the road, for the guanaco team,
it was all kicking off.

499
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,180
Suddenly, there were chulengos
appearing all over the place.

500
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,220
The guanaco mission was complete.

501
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,460
But the rhea team
were running out of options.

502
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,540
They had one last tip
they could check out.

503
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:51,620
We'd been told about a lake
where rheas are often seen.

504
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,660
It was called Lake Nandu, which is

505
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,540
the local Spanish word for 'rhea',
which I thought was a good omen.

506
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,940
After a couple of tense hours
scouring the horizon...

507
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,340
I've just seen a rhea
with his chicks.

508
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,580
He's just come over the big hill.

509
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,700
His chicks were just a few days old.

510
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,700
BIRDSONG

511
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,940
And this time, Doco managed to get
the shots that he needed

512
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:30,420
that helped us tell that story of
our dad with his little chicks.

513
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,860
It was a huge relief.

514
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,340
Sometimes, it's the things that you
think are going to be easy

515
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,780
that take you by surprise
and prove to be the most difficult.

516
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,860
It just goes to show that you can
never second-guess Patagonia.

517
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,460
BIRDSONG

518
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,460
Next time, we travel
along Patagonia's coastline,

519
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,460
from the turbulent,
freezing waters of Cape Horn...

520
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,060
..forging northwards
over 1,000 miles...

521
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,100
..where rich ocean currents favour
those who dare to be different.

522
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,300
