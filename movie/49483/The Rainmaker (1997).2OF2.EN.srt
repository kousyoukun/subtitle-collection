00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:37,248
Uh-huh.
ls--ls this legal?

171
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,751
Uh, of course
it's legal, Mr. Porter.

172
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:41,946
Just don't
go telling anybody.

173
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:45,752
Look, I represent this lady
whose son died of leukemia

174
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:48,293
because the Great Benefit
lnsurance Company

175
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:49,328
wouldn't give them

176
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:51,295
the money they needed
for an operation.

177
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:52,763
Oh, why,
that sounds awful.

178
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:56,097
You know, I had an aunt
that had that same disease.

179
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:59,263
Kept wasting away
and my uncle cried and--

180
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:03,934
l'll do what I can.

181
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,443
Rudy: Well, yes, sir.

182
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:07,445
Now, thank you, Mr. Porter.
You have a fine afternoon.

183
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:09,208
[Whispering]
Bye. Bye.

184
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,307
What--What--
What about the aunt?

185
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:12,783
Where'd the aunt
come from?

186
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:13,784
I don't know.

187
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,286
You told me
to be sympathetic.

188
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,323
I know but you don't
have to--

189
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,322
Don't elaborate.

190
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:19,289
Get your coffee.

191
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,792
Let's go back
up there.

192
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,824
l'm just trying to help.

193
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:24,794
Come on.

194
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,422
Right behind you.

195
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:30,028
Ladies and gentlemen,

196
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,594
what l'm about to ask

197
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:36,130
is the most important
question of the day.

198
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:37,836
lt's a simple question.

199
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,071
Can be answered
yes or no.

200
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:42,671
Listen carefully.

201
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:46,879
Have any of y'all been
contacted about this case?

202
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:50,846
Drummond: This is
serious business.

203
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:52,823
[Whispering]
Bingo.

204
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:55,486
We need to know now.

205
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:58,155
Let me ask it another way.

206
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,597
Did any of you have
a conversation recently

207
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:05,762
with either
Mr. Rudy Baylor

208
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,466
or directly behind him,
Mr. Deck Schifflet.

209
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,508
Objection, Your Honor!

210
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:10,803
This is an outrage!

211
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:12,469
What are you doing,
Mr. Drummond?

212
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,876
Drummond: Your Honor,

213
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:15,573
we have reason to believe

214
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:17,479
that this panel
has been tampered with.

215
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,778
And he's
accusing me.

216
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:22,150
I don't understand what
you're doing, Mr. Drummond.

217
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,153
Well, neither do I,
Your Honor.

218
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:24,154
Neither do I.

219
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:26,282
Approach the bench, please.

220
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:32,155
Your Honor, this panel's
been tampered with.

221
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:33,323
I want proof, Leo.

222
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,197
I can't say
without divulging

223
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,930
confidential information,
Your Honor.

224
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:39,028
You are just
out of your mind.

225
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:40,663
You are acting
rather bizarrely.

226
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,002
l'm gonna prove it.

227
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:43,564
Kipler: How?

228
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:45,668
Deck: Accuse us
of something like that.

229
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,042
Tamper. I--

230
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:48,637
lt's ridiculous.

231
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:50,682
Just allow me to finish
questioning the panel.

232
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,342
I think the truth
will come forth.

233
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,943
Kipler: Any objection,
Mr. Baylor?

234
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,147
No, no objection.

235
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:58,986
Very well. Proceed.

236
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:00,150
Right.

237
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:06,089
What in the Sam Hill
is going on up there?

238
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:07,860
Oh, it's just
lawyer stuff.

239
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:09,962
Drummond: Mr. Porter.

240
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:14,632
I want to ask you
a direct question.

241
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:16,174
And l'd appreciate

242
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:19,541
an honest response.

243
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,876
You ask an honest
question,

244
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:23,540
l'll give you
an honest answer.

245
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:25,777
Fair enough.

246
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,911
Did you, Mr. Porter,
or did you not

247
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:30,148
have a phone conversation
a few days ago

248
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:31,588
with Mr. Rudy Baylor?

249
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:32,783
Hell, no.

250
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:35,191
Drummond: I thought
you were gonna give me

251
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:36,319
an honest answer.

252
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,625
I gave you an honest answer.

253
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:40,791
Are you sure,
Mr. Porter?

254
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,528
l'm damn sure.

255
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:43,796
Mr. Porter,

256
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,235
in a courthouse.

257
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:46,999
ln a courthouse
in the United States,

258
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,337
in a courthouse of justice,
state of Tennessee,

259
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:51,433
I say you did not provide
an honest answer!

260
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,842
Don't call me a liar.

261
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:53,879
Mr. Drummond.

262
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:56,540
You son of a bitch.

263
00:12:58,284 --> 00:12:59,808
Hey, get off him!

264
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,080
Judge Kipler:
Order in the court!

265
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:04,622
Bailiff,

266
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,555
remove Mr. Porter
from this courtroom.

267
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,789
Mr. Billy Porter,
you are excused from the jury.

268
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:14,658
Drummond: Your Honor,

269
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:18,261
I move to dismiss the entire
panel, Your Honor.

270
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:20,771
Denied.

271
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,171
lt's been tainted.

272
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:31,145
You, uh...

273
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:35,083
Your shoe,
you left it--

274
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:39,582
Judge Kipler: Are we ready
to proceed now

275
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:42,628
with the jury selection,
Mr. Drummond?

276
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:46,131
Drummond: l'm ready
to proceed, Your Honor.

277
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,496
Kipler: Thank you.

278
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:13,492
We'll file it today.

279
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,651
He'll go crazy.

280
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:15,716
He already is crazy.

281
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:18,730
He'll come after you.

282
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,026
I hope he does.

283
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:22,829
This is that good
processed turkey.

284
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:24,460
- Oh.
- Oh.

285
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:26,937
Well, I gotta get
back to court.

286
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:29,031
l'm late. I gotta
get back to court.

287
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:30,666
What about
your sandwich?

288
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:33,371
Oh, I was gonna
take that with me.

289
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:35,846
Good, good.

290
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:37,246
l'll see you
later.

291
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:39,011
Ok?

292
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:49,351
How'd it go?

293
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:51,328
I served the papers
on Cliff

294
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:52,921
when he was
on his way to lunch.

295
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,557
He didn't take it
too well,

296
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:56,431
but I said I was
ready to rumble.

297
00:14:56,502 --> 00:14:57,526
He backed down.

298
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:00,697
Hey, man, you better
watch your back.

299
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,107
All right.

300
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:07,373
Thanks a lot, Butch.
I appreciate it.

301
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:08,743
Clerk:
Do you solemnly swear

302
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:11,214
that the testimony you're
about to give in this cause

303
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,307
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

304
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:14,285
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God.

305
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:15,320
Yes, I do.

306
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:18,152
You may take
the stand.

307
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,499
Please state your name
for the record.

308
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:31,263
Mrs. Margarine Black.

309
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:32,929
Now, Mrs. Black,

310
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,235
you are the mother
of Donny Ray Black,

311
00:15:35,307 --> 00:15:37,571
who recently died of acute
myelocytic leukemia

312
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:38,803
because the defendant,
Great Benefit--

313
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:40,209
Drummond:

Leading.

315
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:45,478
Sustained.

316
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,112
Your son,

317
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:51,247
Donny Ray,
needed an operation.

318
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:52,255
Objection.

319
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:53,416
Leading.

320
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,119
Kipler: Sustained.

321
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,360
Mrs. Black, did you purchase
this medical policy

322
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,594
because you were concerned about
medical care for your son?

323
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:03,600
Objection.

324
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,034
l'm sorry, Your Honor.

325
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:06,503
Leading.

326
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:08,666
Kipler: Mr. Baylor,

327
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:10,470
why don't you
show the policy

328
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:12,204
and ask her
why she bought it?

329
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:13,540
Rudy: Ok.

330
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:18,039
Mr. Baylor.

331
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:20,950
You must ask
to approach the witness.

332
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,116
Rudy: Sorry,
Your Honor.

333
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,488
Permission to approach
the witness.

334
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,753
You may.

335
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:33,392
[Whispering]
Take it easy.

336
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:36,094
Take it easy.

337
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:39,365
Mrs. Black: "Great Benefit.
July 7, 1996.

338
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:47,971
Re: Policy 7849909886.

339
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:50,311
Dear Mrs. Black,

340
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:52,543
On 7 prior occasions

341
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:56,418
this company has denied
your claim in writing.

342
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:02,052
We now deny it
for the eighth and final time.

343
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:07,088
You must be stupid,
stupid, stupid.

344
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,030
Sincerely Everett Lufkin,

345
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:13,469
Vice President,
Claims Department."

346
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:17,567
Read it again.

347
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:18,769
Objection.

348
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:19,811
Repetitious,
Your Honor.

349
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:20,937
Kipler: Sustained.

350
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:25,277
I tender
the witness.

351
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:26,909
Mr. Drummond.

352
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:28,886
Your Honor.

353
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:32,048
Please remove that exhibit.

354
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:34,558
Now, Mrs. Black.

355
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:35,719
Ahem.

356
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:38,686
Turn it off.

357
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:47,464
Mrs. Black, why did you sue
Great Benefit for $10 million?

358
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,599
ls that all?

359
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,668
I beg your pardon.

360
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:55,270
I thought it was
more than that.

361
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:57,076
ls that so?

362
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,413
Yes. Your client has
about a billion dollars,

363
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:01,350
and your client
killed my son.

364
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,015
I wanted to sue
for a whole lot more.

365
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:08,786
What would you do
with the money?

366
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,761
lf this jury awards you
$10 million,

367
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,263
what you gonna do
with the money?

368
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,263
l'm gonna give it

369
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:16,199
to the American
Leukemia Society.

370
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:17,895
Every cent.

371
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:22,665
I don't want a dime
of your stinking money.

372
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:26,768
Drummond: Realize you are
under oath, Mrs. Black.

373
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,007
Approach the witness,
Your Honor?

374
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,343
Kipler: You may.

375
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,383
Drummond: Mrs. Black,

376
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,384
I want you to read
from the policy.

377
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:37,718
Page 16, section "K,"
paragraph 14, item "E,"

378
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,087
in which
the insurance company

379
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:40,716
has in plain
English wording said

380
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:44,092
that it will not pay for
experimental procedures.

381
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:46,893
Now, your lawsuit says

382
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:49,230
that your son would have
been saved if he had had

383
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:50,632
a bone marrow
transplant.

384
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:52,694
lsn't it a fact,
Mrs. Black,

385
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:54,170
that there are
only 7,000

386
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,333
bone marrow transplants
performed a year

387
00:18:56,408 --> 00:18:57,739
in the United States?

388
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,402
Less than 200 in
the state of Tennessee?

389
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:00,638
Objection,
Your Honor.

390
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:01,907
He's leading
the witness.

391
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:04,415
This is cross-examination.
Leading is allowed.

392
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:06,280
Overruled,

393
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:08,252
as to leading.

394
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,757
Drummond: So it was not
covered by the policy.

395
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:13,814
Now, Mrs. Black,

396
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:16,623
who was it, uh...

397
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:19,596
who was it first diagnosed
your son's condition?

398
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,167
Well, at the very
beginning,

399
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:26,693
our doctor,
Dr. Page.

400
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:29,138
Drummond: That would be
your family physician?

401
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,835
Yes, sir, it would.

402
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,309
ls he a good doctor?

403
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:34,073
He's a very good doctor.

404
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:36,637
And is it not true,
Mrs. Black,

405
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:38,148
that this capable,
truthful man

406
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:42,119
told you repeatedly
that a bone marrow transplant

407
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:43,211
would do your son no good

408
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,053
because of the type
of leukemia he had?

409
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,423
Well, no.

410
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:50,792
No, he did not.

411
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:51,830
He didn't say that.

412
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:54,457
Not like that,
to me.

413
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:57,128
Drummond: Approach
the witness, Your Honor?

414
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:58,601
Kipler: You may.

415
00:19:58,671 --> 00:20:04,371
Mrs. Black, is this not
Dr. Page's letterhead?

416
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:07,435
And at the bottom there,
is that not his signature?

417
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:09,276
[Whispering]
He can't do that.

418
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:10,747
Why?

419
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:11,805
Because he can't
introduce evidence

420
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:14,114
that way.
Plus it's hearsay.

421
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:16,017
Objection, Your Honor.

422
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:19,990
A--A letter from--from
the Blacks' family physician

423
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,118
to Mr. Drummond
is inadmissible.

424
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:24,094
Drummond: That is quite
correct, Your Honor.

425
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:25,994
And l'm not asking
for this letter

426
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:27,464
to be admitted
into evidence.

427
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:30,161
l'm simply asking
that this witness

428
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:31,293
be allowed
to read the letter

429
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,099
under rule 612
of the Tennessee

430
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:34,434
rules of evidence.

431
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:36,303
So her recollection
can be refreshed.

432
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,809
Kipler: Mr. Baylor,
what do you say?

433
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:40,435
I don't know, Your Honor.

434
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:41,638
I just object to this.

435
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:45,480
And also we were not
furnished this letter

436
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:46,950
in pre-trial discovery.

437
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,487
What do you say
to that, Mr. Drummond?

438
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:51,284
I had no idea this
letter would be needed.

439
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:53,052
I expected this lady
to tell the truth

440
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,558
about what her doctor
told her.

441
00:20:56,762 --> 00:20:58,855
Anything else, Mr. Baylor?

442
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,467
No.

443
00:21:04,603 --> 00:21:05,763
Kipler: Mr. Drummond,

444
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:08,500
l'm gonna give you
a little latitude,

445
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:10,201
but don't stray too far.

446
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:12,835
Very well, Your Honor.
Now, Mrs. Black,

447
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:15,471
does that letter refresh
your recollection

448
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:17,777
as to whether or not
Donny Ray's leukemia

449
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,147
was the kind
that could be helped

450
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:20,378
with a bone marrow
transplant?

451
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:22,750
Well, see, now,
he is not a specialist.

452
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:23,753
But he is a licensed,

453
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:27,087
experienced,
capable physician

454
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:29,889
who lovingly told you
time and time again

455
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:33,159
what you quite understandably
did not want to accept:

456
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:36,065
That your son
was going to die of leukemia

457
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:38,933
despite the best efforts
of medical science.

458
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:40,369
ls that not true?

459
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:42,999
Mrs. Black: But he wasn't
a specialist.

460
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:44,474
I didn't believe him.

461
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:47,376
Drummond: Not only did you
not believe him, ma'am,

462
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:49,311
but you were less than
truthful with me

463
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:51,042
and with this jury
moments ago

464
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:52,947
when you told us under oath

465
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:55,782
that Dr. Page never said
that your son

466
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:58,288
had the type of leukemia
that could not be treated

467
00:21:58,357 --> 00:21:59,756
by a bone marrow transplant.

468
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:01,884
I believe
your exact words were,

469
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,121
"He never said that.

470
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:05,322
Not like that

471
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:07,160
to me."

472
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:10,133
He wasn't a specialist.

473
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:12,500
I just wanted Donny Ray

474
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:17,736
to have the best medical
treatment available.

475
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,335
You'd do the same thing.

476
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:22,471
Drummond:
Of course, ma'am.

477
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:25,244
Of course.

478
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:26,875
That'll be all.

479
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:31,449
You may step down,
Mrs. Black.

480
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,498
I didn't do very good,
did I?

481
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,159
Oh, no, no,
you did fine.

482
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:44,327
You did fine.

483
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:46,462
lt's all right.
The jury can see

484
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,096
exactly what
he's up to.

485
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:49,572
The jury can see
what he's up to.

486
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:50,608
I need a smoke.

487
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:51,574
I know you do.

488
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:52,473
We're gonna get
to that later.

489
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:54,068
[Thunder]

490
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:56,103
[Kelly Sighs]

491
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:59,116
I hope he hasn't
changed the locks.

492
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:00,742
Are you scared?

493
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:02,753
Yeah.

494
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:06,652
Let's do it.

495
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:11,192
[Thunder]

496

All right,

697
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:26,062
let's talk
about the Black file.

698
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:27,764
lt was assigned to you?

699
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,898
Yes, that's correct.

700
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:32,204
The initial claim
from Mrs. Black

701
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:33,301
was assigned to me.

702
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:34,936
Pursuant to company
policy at the time,

703
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:37,777
I sent her
a letter of denial.

704
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:38,838
Why?

705
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:40,851
Why?

706
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:44,851
Because all claims
were initially denied.

707
00:34:48,526 --> 00:34:50,016
All claims?

708
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:52,585
All claims.

709
00:34:58,069 --> 00:35:01,095
Ok, this is how it works.

710
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:03,367
The policy...

711
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:05,136
is sold door to door

712
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,643

each week.

715
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:15,885
The claim comes in
and is assigned to a handler.

716
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:20,220
That's basically
a low level paper pusher.

717
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:24,955
Anyway, the handler
reviews it

718
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:27,793
and immediately sends
a letter to the insured

719
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:28,958
denying the clam.

720
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:30,762
The claims handler

721
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:33,770
then sends the file
over to underwriting.

722
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:36,272
Underwriting sends a memo
back to claims

723
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:39,333
saying, "Don't pay this
until you hear from us."

724
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,935
Now, what you should
keep in mind

725
00:35:42,013 --> 00:35:43,446
is that even though
all these people work

726
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:44,481
for this big company,

727
00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:46,141
and they all work
in the same building,

728
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:47,707
they don't know each other.

729
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:50,310
Nor do they know what the other
department is up to.

730
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:51,480
Now, this is very intentional.

731
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:53,751
The departments are kept
at war with each other.

732

Now, meanwhile,

there's the client.

Do you
recognize this?

829
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:17,454
Yes. lt's a Great Benefits
Company Claims Manual.

830
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,948
Would you do me a favor

831
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:24,017
and just flip over
to section "U," please?

832
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:30,463
There is
no section "U."

833
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:32,162
But do you remember
a section "U"

834
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:34,101
when you were a senior
claims examiner?

835
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:37,003
Yes, I do.

836
00:40:37,074 --> 00:40:39,907
Section "U" was
an executive memorandum

837
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:42,502
in the senior
examiners manual.

838
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,138
Thank you.

839
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:46,080
Your Honor,

840
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,586
this is Jackie Lemancyzk's
actual senior claims manual,

841
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:51,383
and within it, there is
an executive memorandum

842
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:52,752
entitled section "U."

843
00:40:52,823 --> 00:40:53,812
I ask that I might
approach--

844
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:55,722
Objection, Your Honor.
Approach the bench?

845
00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:00,923
Your Honor, we were not
given a complete manual.

846
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:02,226
Your Honor,
this document contains

847
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,427
executive memoranda
that are stolen work papers

848
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:05,560
and may not be admitted.

849
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:06,568
May not be admitted?

850
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:07,831
Can you prove this, Leo?

851
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:10,237
Your Honor, I ask that you
instruct my colleague here

852
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:11,297
not to read from

853
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,605
nor to make reference
to any suspect--

854
00:41:13,678 --> 00:41:17,205
I don't understand
why this is not admissible.

855
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:18,908
lt was not proffered
at the correct time,

856
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:20,109
nor do we know
how it was obtained--

857
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:22,015
I just found out
about this last night.

858
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:23,986
Assuming that I can't
get this in now,

859
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:25,784
do you have any more
questions for the witness?

860
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:27,658
No, Your Honor.

861
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:30,455
You may cross-examine,
Mr. Drummond.

862
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:32,086
Thank you.

863
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:48,341
ls it true,
Miss Lemancyzk...

864
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:52,242
that you have recently
been committed

865
00:41:52,316 --> 00:41:54,250
to an institution
for various problems?

866
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:56,445
I was not committed.

867
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,683
I am suffering from
alcoholism and depression,

868
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:03,193
and I voluntarily
checked into a facility.

869
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:05,092
I was supposed
to be covered

870
00:42:05,162 --> 00:42:07,357
by my group policy
at Great Benefit,

871
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:09,865
and they, of course,
are denying my claim.

872
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:11,799
ls that why you're here,
Miss Lemancyzk?

873
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:14,235
Because you're angry
with Great Benefit?

874
00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:15,272
Miss Lemancyzk?

875
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:17,933
I hate Great Benefit

876
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:20,773
and most of the worms
that work there.

877
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:23,075
Did you feel
Mr. Lufkin was a worm

878
00:42:23,147 --> 00:42:24,705
when you were
sleeping with him?

879
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,843
Objection.

880
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:29,112
Your Honor,

881
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:31,450
Mr. Drummond might find this
fun to talk about,

882
00:42:31,522 --> 00:42:33,717
but this is
not relevant at all.

883
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:35,656
Oh, there's
no fun for me.

884
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:37,125
Overruled.

885
00:42:37,194 --> 00:42:38,422
Let's see
where this takes us.

886
00:42:38,496 --> 00:42:42,990
Drummond: You admit to having
an affair with Mr. Lufkin?

887
00:42:49,073 --> 00:42:51,701
Miss Lemancyzk?

888
00:42:56,647 --> 00:43:01,243
As long as I had sex
with certain executives

889
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,787
at Great Benefit,

890
00:43:03,854 --> 00:43:08,188
my pay was increased,
and I was promoted.

891
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:11,160
Lemancyzk: When I stopped,
I was demoted.

892
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:12,718
Drummond:
Miss Lemancyzk,

893
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:14,628
as an employee
of Great Benefit,

894
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:16,530
you promised
not to disclose

895
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,932
confidential private
claims information.

896
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:20,436
- Yes?
- Yes.

897
00:43:20,504 --> 00:43:21,869
ln fact, you testified

898
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:24,703
that you sealed
that promise

899
00:43:24,775 --> 00:43:27,767
by demand of payment
for $10,000, didn't you?

900
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:29,745
That payment
was not my idea.

901
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:31,338
But you accepted it,
didn't you?

902
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:33,349
You put it right
in your pocketbook.

903
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:34,645
Even though
in your mind,

904
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,812
you never intended
to keep that promise.

905
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:39,447
ln fact,
you were very angry

906
00:43:39,523 --> 00:43:41,957
at Great Benefit and
Mr. Lufkin, weren't you?

907
00:43:42,026 --> 00:43:43,960
You know,
they preyed on me,

908
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:46,223
because I was broke,
and I was single,

909
00:43:46,297 --> 00:43:47,696
and I had 2 kids.

910
00:43:47,765 --> 00:43:49,460
So you told him you're
gonna go to his wife,

911
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:50,465
go to the newspapers.

912
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:51,592
And that $10,000,

913
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:53,830
that was just a piece
of blackmail, wasn't it?

914
00:43:53,904 --> 00:43:57,135
A way to extort money
from the company you hated!

915
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,334
lsn't that right?

916
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,637
No, that's not true.

917
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,871
ln fact, your testimony
here today is just a lie.

918
00:44:01,946 --> 00:44:03,538
You stole
company work papers,

919
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:06,879
confidential reports
as blackmail for revenge.

920
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:11,354
Hell hath no fury
as what, Miss Lemancyzk?

921
00:44:11,422 --> 00:44:14,550
A woman scorned!

922
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:17,594
Your Honor, I move
that all documents

923
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:20,824
provided the plaintiff
by Miss Jackie Lemancyzk

924
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:22,763
be deemed
stolen work papers

925
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,596
and struck
from these proceedings.

926
00:44:32,877 --> 00:44:37,246
Based on the evidence
presently before the court,

927
00:44:37,314 --> 00:44:39,009
these documents
are inadmissible.

928
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,141
Ohh.

929
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:45,545
No further questions.

930
00:44:45,623 --> 00:44:47,215
Kipler:
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

931
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,952
Mr. Baylor.

932
00:44:51,362 --> 00:44:53,455
You may step down,
Miss Lemancyzk.

933
00:45:01,038 --> 00:45:02,733
l'm sorry.

934
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:18,917
Man: Hello.

935
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,684
Hi. This is Deck Schifflet.

936
00:45:20,758 --> 00:45:22,749
I need to speak to Big Rhino.
Can you connect me?

937
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:24,988
Big Rhino?
Just a second.

938
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:26,154
Ok.

939
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:32,193
Hello?

940
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:33,736
Hey, boss, it's Deck.

941
00:45:33,804 --> 00:45:35,271
Oh, hey, Deck,
how you doing?

942
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:36,431
Good. How are you?

943
00:45:36,507 --> 00:45:37,565
Well, l'm cool.

944
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:39,370
Are you here?

945
00:45:39,443 --> 00:45:40,910
Well,
l'm here and there.

946
00:45:40,978 --> 00:45:43,071
Ah, yeah,
here and there.

947
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:47,311
Listen, I got
a stolen-evidence situation.

948
00:45:47,384 --> 00:45:50,512
Ok. Stolen evidence,
uh...

949
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:52,317
Let me see, uh...

950
00:45:52,389 --> 00:45:54,823
Ok. The De Soto case.

951
00:45:54,892 --> 00:45:55,859
De Soto?

952
00:45:55,926 --> 00:45:59,362
Carmine De Soto.
You remember him?

953
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,328
Club Ruby.

954
00:46:00,397 --> 00:46:01,762
Uh-huh.

955
00:46:01,832 --> 00:46:03,766
Where--Where do I find that?

956
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:07,270
Uh, around '92,
you'll find it, uh,

957
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:09,738
let's see,
650 something, uh...

958
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:11,172
Southwest Second.

959
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:12,641
Boss, you're a lifesaver.

960
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,642
'92?

961
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:15,338
Yeah. Club Ruby case.

962
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:17,243
'92...

963
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:18,338
Carmine De Soto.

964
00:46:18,415 --> 00:46:19,473
Carmine De Soto.

965
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,482
Club Ruby.

966
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:21,449
Club Ruby.

967
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:22,781
lt's from
the appellate court.

968
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:24,753
Yeah.
lt kind of rings a bell.

969
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:30,126
I got it!

970
00:46:30,194 --> 00:46:32,253
And from Bruiser,
of all people.

971
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,263
Bruiser? I thought you didn't
know where Bruiser was.

972
00:46:34,331 --> 00:46:37,300
Well, I don't, but I got
an emergency-contact number.

973
00:46:37,368 --> 00:46:39,529
I call them, they get me
in touch with him.

974
00:46:39,603 --> 00:46:40,797
Look, Rudy,

975
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:43,101
nobody knows more than Bruiser
about stolen evidence.

976
00:46:43,173 --> 00:46:45,107
You might say
it's his stock and trade.

977
00:46:45,175 --> 00:46:46,267
- [Ring]
- Hello?

978
00:46:46,343 --> 00:46:47,640
Woman: Mr. Rudy Baylor?

979
00:46:47,711 --> 00:46:48,609
Yes.

980
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:50,374
This is
the Shelby County D.A.

981
00:46:50,447 --> 00:46:51,880
Can you come
to the courthouse tonight?

982
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:54,042
l'd like to discuss
the Kelly Riker case.

983
00:46:54,118 --> 00:46:55,050
Sure.

984
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,552
Come to room 6.

985
00:46:58,355 --> 00:47:01,017
There's an advantage to dealing
with pimps and thieves.

986
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:04,060
ln the case of Carmine De Soto
vs. the Club Ruby,

987
00:47:04,128 --> 00:47:06,062
there are reams
of stolen evidence.

988
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,121
Now, Bruiser worked
on this stuff himself.

989
00:47:08,198 --> 00:47:10,666
Not now.
I got to go.

990
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:11,962
You got to go?

991
00:47:12,036 --> 00:47:14,470
You got the CEO of Great Benefit
coming in tomorrow.

992
00:47:14,538 --> 00:47:17,769
We--We got to nail this guy,
come on.

993
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:30,943
Good luck, Kelly.

994
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:32,488
Thanks.

995
00:47:37,027 --> 00:47:38,927
I met with the D.A.

996
00:47:38,996 --> 00:47:40,896
She's not
gonna prosecute.

997
00:47:40,965 --> 00:47:44,059
Said she'd never
get a conviction.

998
00:47:44,134 --> 00:47:46,227
lt was self-defense,
Kelly.

999
00:47:57,781 --> 00:48:00,045
Deck: The plaintiff
would like to call

1000
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:02,950
Wilfred Keeley
to the stand.

1001
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,647
Clerk: Raise your
right hand, please.

1002
00:48:04,722 --> 00:48:06,622
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

1003
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,850
you're about to give
in this cause

1004
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:09,290
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

1005
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,260
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1006
00:48:11,328 --> 00:48:12,260
I do.

1007
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:14,092
You may take the stand.

1008
00:48:16,433 --> 00:48:18,731
Judge Kipler: State your name
for the record.

1009
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:19,996
Wilfred Keeley.

1010
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,935
May I approach
the witness, Your Honor?

1011
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:23,439
You may.

1012
00:48:23,507 --> 00:48:26,840
Mr. Keeley, uh, in this
Great Benefit brochure,

1013
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,707
is that you?
ls that your name?

1014
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:29,711
Yes.

1015
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,078
And what do
those initials stand for?

1016
00:48:32,149 --> 00:48:33,548
CEO?

1017
00:48:33,617 --> 00:48:36,552
Yeah. What do they stand for?
What does "CEO" mean?

1018
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,053
Chief Executive Officer.

1019
00:48:38,122 --> 00:48:40,352
Chief Executive Officer.
Thank you, thank you.

1020
00:48:40,424 --> 00:48:43,188
So you're the--
you're the guy.

1021
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,058
You're the main guy,
you're the cheese.

1022
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,791
The buck stops with you.

1023
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:49,264
You could say that, yes.

1024
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,527
Yeah. Ok. Thank you.

1025
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:53,434
Uh, Your Honor, l'd like
to turn the questioning

1026
00:48:53,504 --> 00:48:58,305
of Mr. Keeley over
to my partner Rudy Baylor.

1027
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,967
[Whispering]
Are you out of your mind?

1028
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:01,136
You don't have a license.

1029
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,145
I didn't have a choice.
What are you doing?

1030
00:49:03,213 --> 00:49:04,612
You're late.

1031
00:49:04,682 --> 00:49:05,979
Good morning, Your Honor.

1032
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,018
Sorry l'm late, sir.

1033
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:10,383
Approach the witness,
Your Honor?

1034
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:12,183
You may.

1035
00:49:12,256 --> 00:49:13,883
This is the claims manual

1036
00:49:13,957 --> 00:49:15,891
that was given to me
by Jackie Lemancyzk.

1037
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:16,891
Drummond: Objection,
Your Honor.

1038
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,450
Stolen work papers.
lnadmissible.

1039
00:49:18,529 --> 00:49:19,461
You ruled on this.

1040
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:20,690
Kipler: Sustained.

1041
00:49:20,764 --> 00:49:22,095
May we approach?

1042
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,529
Drummond: I thought this matter
was already settled, Your Honor.

1043
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:30,539
Rudy: Your Honor,
I just this morning

1044
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:32,131
found a case
that is controlled

1045
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:33,540
in this
factual situation.

1046
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,975
Judge Kipler:
What do you have?

1047
00:49:35,045 --> 00:49:37,536
lf you'll just take
a look at this ruling.

1048
00:49:37,614 --> 00:49:40,174
lt's Club Ruby
vs. Carmine De Soto.

1049
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,650
Copy for Your Honor
and one for Mr. Drummond.

1050
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,689
Number 585,
Southwest Second, page 431,

1051
00:49:45,756 --> 00:49:48,520
argued by Bruiser--
by J. Lyman Stone.

1052
00:49:48,592 --> 00:49:49,820
And it shows very clearly

1053
00:49:49,893 --> 00:49:51,918
that stolen documents
are, in fact, admissible

1054
00:49:51,995 --> 00:49:54,691
if the lawyers played
no part in the theft.

1055
00:49:54,765 --> 00:49:57,427
Well, according
to these head notes,

1056
00:49:57,501 --> 00:50:00,095
this case will overrule
your objection.

1057
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,467
Sorry, Leo.

1058
00:50:01,538 --> 00:50:04,507
Oh, l'm sure you are,
Your Honor.

1059
00:50:04,575 --> 00:50:06,304
But note
my strong objection.

1060
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:07,502
Objection noted.

1061
00:50:07,578 --> 00:50:09,512
May I approach?

1062
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,842
Do so.

1063
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,241
Uh...Your Honor...

1064
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:17,787
Your Honor, l'm sorry.

1065
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:20,153
Excuse the interruption,
Mr. Keeley.

1066
00:50:20,224 --> 00:50:22,089
We were about
to talk about

1067
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:24,184
the Great Benefit
Claims Manual.

1068
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:28,425
ls that a complete Great Benefit
Claims Manual, sir?

1069
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,426
Yes.

1070
00:50:31,502 --> 00:50:33,595
Does it have
a section "U"?

1071
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:41,670
Keeley: lt has
a section "U" in it.

1072
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:43,770
Well, let's talk about
this mysterious section "U."

1073
00:50:43,847 --> 00:50:45,815
Why don't we explain it
to the jury?

1074
00:50:45,883 --> 00:50:47,680
Take a look at it.

1075
00:50:48,852 --> 00:50:50,752
Just read paragraph 3.

1076
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:58,191
"Claim handlers are directed
to deny all claims

1077
00:50:58,262 --> 00:51:00,822
within 3 days
of receipt of claim.

1078
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:02,160
No exceptions."

1079
00:51:02,232 --> 00:51:05,099
Now, how do you explain
this section "U"?

1080
00:51:05,169 --> 00:51:08,263
Well, sometimes
we get some frivolous

1081
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:11,830
and fraudulent claims
in our business,

1082
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:14,309
and sometimes we have to use
this kind of language

1083
00:51:14,378 --> 00:51:16,642
to focus in on
the legitimate

1084
00:51:16,713 --> 00:51:18,908
and more needy claims.

1085
00:51:20,384 --> 00:51:23,046
Mr. Keeley, do you honestly
expect this court

1086
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,951
to believe that explanation?

1087
00:51:25,022 --> 00:51:26,614
Well, this chapter
merely denotes

1088
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,625
in-house
processing guidelines.

1089
00:51:29,693 --> 00:51:31,160
ln-house
processing guidelines.

1090
00:51:31,228 --> 00:51:33,458
No, Mr. Keeley.
No, it does not.

1091
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,293
Section "U" does
a lot more than that.

1092
00:51:35,365 --> 00:51:37,128
I don't think
it does that, son.

1093
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:39,465
Mr. Keeley, doesn't it
explain precisely

1094
00:51:39,536 --> 00:51:42,004
how claims should be routed
and shuffled and rerouted,

1095
00:51:42,072 --> 00:51:44,063
anything to avoid payment?

1096
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:45,199
I admit nothing.

1097
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:46,640
Your Honor,
approach the witness?

1098
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,007
You may.

1099
00:51:52,249 --> 00:51:54,513
Now, Mr. Keeley,

1100
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:58,544
how many policies did
Great Benefit have in effect

1101
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:02,353
in the year 1995?

1102
00:52:05,462 --> 00:52:07,726
I don't know.

1103
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:09,288
Well, let's see.

1104
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:15,331
Does the figure 98,000 sound
correct, give or take a few?

1105
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:18,331
Maybe.

1106
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:20,205
That could be right,
yeah.

1107
00:52:20,277 --> 00:52:21,437
Thank you.

1108
00:52:21,511 --> 00:52:25,106
Now, of these policies,
how many claims were filed?

1109
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,714
Well, I don't--
I don't know that.

1110
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:33,119
Does the figure of 11,400
sound correct to you,

1111
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,817
give or take a few?

1112
00:52:34,892 --> 00:52:36,689
That's about right,

1113
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,560
but l'd have to
verify it, of course.

1114
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:42,155
I see. So the information
that I want

1115
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:43,597
is right there in that book?

1116
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:44,565
Yes.

1117
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:45,966
Can you tell the jury

1118
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:48,402
of the 11 some odd thousand
claims filed,

1119
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:49,905
how many were denied?

1120
00:52:52,442 --> 00:52:55,377
I don't think I could.
That would take more time.

1121
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:57,504
You've had 2 months,
Mr. Keeley.

1122
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:59,412
Now answer the question.

1123
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,785
Well, I...

1124
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,553
I don't think...

1125
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:12,023
Um...

1126
00:53:13,764 --> 00:53:16,392
"9,141."

1127
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:20,665
11,462 filed.

1128
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:25,831
9,141 denied.

Your Honor...

1131
00:53:31,181 --> 00:53:33,115
I have yet another document.

1132
00:53:33,183 --> 00:53:34,445
This is a report

1133

from Great Benefit's
medical committee.

1134

Request permission
under previous precedent

to present it to Mr. Keeley.

00:53:57,474 --> 00:53:59,203
Uh, Mr. Keeley,
that is a report

1140
00:53:59,276 --> 00:54:02,370
from Great Benefit's
own medical committee,

1141
00:54:02,446 --> 00:54:03,845
which you chaired.

1142

Would you please read
from line 18?

"Since bone-marrow

00:54:17,327 --> 00:54:20,558
Great Benefit would be
financially justified

in bone-marrow clinics."

All insurance company premiums

1187

that could not save him.

1188
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,338
I don't even feel good enough
about myself as a lawyer

1189

to make my own summation.

1190
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,911
So I thought l'd...
l'd let Donny Ray do that.

1194
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:17,233
The leukemia was detected
in plenty of time.

1195
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:21,606
I was in the hospital
being treated

1196
00:57:21,678 --> 00:57:22,940
when the doctors realized

1197
00:57:23,013 --> 00:57:24,640
that the only thing
that could save my life

1198
00:57:24,714 --> 00:57:27,342
would be
a bone-marrow transplant.

1199
00:57:28,919 --> 00:57:33,913
So, I got released
from the hospital,

1200
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,891
'cause my family
couldn't afford to pay

they had recommended.

1202

denied our claim.

lf I had had
a bone-marrow transplant,

1207
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:57,905
I would have had
a 90% chance of living.

as I am,

1210
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:08,890
at the lengths to which

from a low-income family

to punitive damages.

1307
01:03:15,665 --> 01:03:20,193
And she's gonna need
a lot of cover for a while.

1308
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:24,540
I still love the law.
l'll always love it,

1309
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:26,905
but maybe I should be
teaching it

1310
01:03:26,976 --> 01:03:30,207
instead of practicing it
out here in the world.

1311
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,407
I need time to work it out.

1312
01:03:32,482 --> 01:03:35,007
Great Benefit
has gone belly up.

1313
01:03:36,586 --> 01:03:39,214
Barring a miracle
way off in the distance,

1314
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:40,881
we won't get a dime.

1315
01:03:40,957 --> 01:03:43,050
God.

1316
01:03:43,126 --> 01:03:45,424
You've put them
out of business, Dot.

1317
01:03:45,495 --> 01:03:48,464
One little woman
from Memphis, Tennessee,

1318
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:51,694
bankrupted them
sons of bitches?

1319
01:03:51,768 --> 01:03:52,757
Oh.

1320
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:54,393
[Chuckles]

1321
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:57,098
l'm gonna go to Donny Ray's
grave tomorrow

1322
01:03:57,173 --> 01:03:59,266
and tell him all about it.

1323
01:04:05,248 --> 01:04:07,910
Rudy:
So, I guess Kelly and I

1324
01:04:07,984 --> 01:04:12,080
will be taking off
first thing in the morning.

1325
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:14,180
We made history, Rudy.

1326
01:04:15,658 --> 01:04:17,023
You know that?

1327
01:04:19,696 --> 01:04:21,664
We can always brag.

1328
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:25,166
Bye.

1329
01:04:26,302 --> 01:04:28,031
Rudy: There's no doubt
about it--l'm hot.

1330
01:04:28,104 --> 01:04:30,163
ln fact, l'm so hot
after this case,

1331
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,037
there's no place for me
to go but down.

1332
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:34,133
See ya.

1333
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,542
Every client I ever have
will expect this--

1334
01:04:36,613 --> 01:04:39,741
The same magic,
nothing less.

1335
01:04:39,816 --> 01:04:42,250
And I could probably
give it to them,

1336
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:44,912
if it didn't matter
how I did it.

1337
01:04:44,988 --> 01:04:46,250
And then one morning,

1338
01:04:46,322 --> 01:04:50,122
l'd wake up and find
that l'd become Leo Drummond.

1339
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:54,653
Now, you give me a call
when you pass the bar exam.

1340
01:04:54,731 --> 01:04:56,961
Yeah, piece of cake!

1341
01:04:59,335 --> 01:05:02,202
Every lawyer,
at least once in every case,

1342
01:05:02,271 --> 01:05:05,468
feels himself crossing a line
he doesn't really mean to cross.

1343
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:06,599
lt just happens.

1344
01:05:06,676 --> 01:05:08,667
And if you cross it
enough times,

1345
01:05:08,745 --> 01:05:10,713
it disappears forever.

1346
01:05:11,948 --> 01:05:14,644
And then you're nothing
but another lawyer joke,

1347
01:05:14,717 --> 01:05:17,743
just another shark
in the dirty water.

1348
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:18,717
