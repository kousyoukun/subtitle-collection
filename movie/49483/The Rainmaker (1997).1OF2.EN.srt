1
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,265
Rudy Baylor: My father
hated lawyers all his life.

2
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,071
He wasn't a great guy,
my old man.

3
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,510
He drank
and beat up my mother.

4
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,376
He beat me up, too.

5
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,348
So you might think
I became a lawyer

6
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,078
just to piss him off,

7
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,120
but you'd be wrong.

8
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,212
l've wanted to be a lawyer

9
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,916
ever since I read about
the civil rights lawyers

10
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,618
in the fifties and sixties

11
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,024
and the amazing uses
they found for the law.

12
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,256
They did what a lot
of people thought

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,957
was the impossible.

14
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,523
They gave lawyers
a good name.

15
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,229
And so I went
to law school,

16
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,101
and it did
piss my father off,

17
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,038
but he was pissed off
anyway.

18
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,099
ln my first year,
he got drunk one day

19
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,166
and fell of a ladder

20
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,508
manufactured by the company
he worked for,

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,048
and he didn't know
who to sue first.

22
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,550
Now, he died a couple
months after that.

23
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,052
l'm empty.

24
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,645
Rudy: Now, some
of my classmates,

25
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,815
they knew they were going
straight from school

26
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,483
into the top law firms,

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,120
thanks mostly to their
family connections.

28
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,390
Now, the only
connections I had

29
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,989
were made in the places
where I tended bar for 3 years

30
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,226
so I could pay my tuition.

31
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,132
And while I still had plans

32
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,761
to shine the blazing
light of justice

33
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,827
into every dark corner,

34
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,772
what I really needed
right now was a job,

35
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,900
and badly,

36
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,570
because there are too many
lawyers in Memphis.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,179
[Siren]

38
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,407
This city's
infested with them.

39
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,784
Second Man:
I don't think so.

40
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,793
Rudy: I can't think of
anything more embarrassing

41
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,055
than telling people

42
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,394
I work for a guy
like Bruiser Stone.

43
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,161
Man: I mean, he's a lawyer,
and they call him Bruiser.

44
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,832
That's how desperate I am.

45
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:21,874
Sure.

46
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,841
Shut the door.

47
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,811
Bruiser: No, not that.
Not that either.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,576
Sure.

49
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,581
Sure.

50
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,448
Let's make it my house.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,886
Ok.

52
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,714
I really pity
the poor FBl technician

53
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,521
that's gonna
have to extract the data

54
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,993
from that conversation.

55
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,292
Live sharks in
a lawyer's office.

56
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,299
lt's a joke.
Get it?

57
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,800
Bruiser: So, prince,

58
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,699
is this the law student
you were telling me about?

59
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,930
Yes, sir.
I just finished

60
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,768
my third year
at Memphis State.

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,307
Couldn't you use him
around here?

62
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,309
Look, l'll vouch for him.

63
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,810
The boy needs a job.

64
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,507
He's tended bar
at our clubs.

65
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,676
This'll be a great place
for you to work, Rudy.

66
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,413
This'll be...

67
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,318
a great place
for you to work.

68
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,880
You can see what
real lawyers do.

69
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,155
Now, it ain't exactly
a salaried position.

70
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,286
lt isn't?

71
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,093
I expect my associates
to pay for themselves--

72
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,260
generate their own fees.

73
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,701
Talk to me.

74
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,035
How exactly
does that work?

75
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,132
Well, Rudy,
you draw $1,000 a month,

76
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,179
and you get to keep 1/3 of all
the fees that you generate.

77
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,340
Now, if you can't
cover your draw

78
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,509
at the end of each month,
you owe me the balance.

79
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,553
Do you understand?

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,315
Sounds fair to me,
Rudy.

81
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,083
That's a hell
of a deal, really.

82
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,216
You can make a lot
of money this way.

83
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,281
Um...

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,918
Bruiser: l'll tell you
something, Rudy.

85
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,724
That's the only way
I operate.

86
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,424
And l'll get you
a lot of good cases.

87
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,262
I have cases.

88
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,700
Uh...

89
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,363
I have 2 cases
right now.

90
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,066
One is a will

91
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,471
that l'm drafting
for an old woman.

92
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,134
She's loaded, too.
She's worth millions.

93
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,269
And then I have
this other case.

94
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,506
lt's an insurance case.

95
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,674
Great Benefit.
You heard of 'em.

96
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,877
You got these clients signed?

97
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,079
l'm on my way
to see 'em right now,

98
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,815
and they'll listen
to me, too.

99
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,481
I helped 'em
over at a law workshop.

100
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,185
All right,
l'm gonna have you talk

101
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,091
to an associate of mine,
Deck Schifflet.

102
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,722
He used to work with these
big insurance companies.

103
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,528
He handles all the high-powered
stuff around here.

104
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,001
Hey, Deck!

105
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,196
Deck!

106
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,239
Damn it.

107
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,773
You got the paperwork
on this stuff?

108
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,739
ln my car.

109
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:36,832
Good.

110
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,967
[Door Opens]

111
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,748
Bruiser: Hey, good lookin'.

112
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,443
This is Deck Schifflet.

113
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,009
This man will get you
plugged in.

114
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,611
What I want you to do,

115
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,385
I want you to draw up a lawsuit
against this Great Benefit,

116
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,188
and you put my name on it.

117
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,956
We're gonna file it today.

118
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,361
Thank you.

119
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,490
Rudy, you're gonna
learn a lot.

120
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,091
Rudy, l'm glad
you came here.

121
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,103
You're making good
choices already, son.

122
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,331
All right,
well, thank you.

123
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,896
Ok, thank you.

124
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,601
Close the door on your
way out now, ok?

125
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,109
Woman: Law offices.
May I help you?

126
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,542
This is an office,
there's people in it.

127
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,909
lf there's somebody
in the office,

128
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,311
you can't have it,
it's off limits.

129
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,780
This is the bathroom.

130
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:17,781
Woman:
Just a minute.

131
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,408
Sorry.

132
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,146
So, are you
an associate here?

133
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,744
Sort of. Not really.

134
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,221
l'm actually
not a lawyer yet.

135
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,554
Bruiser usually asks me

136
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,389
to review the insurance cases
when they come in.

137
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,827
I used to work for Specific
Mutual lnsurance Company.

138
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,626
I got sick of that.
I went to law school.

139
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,031
Well, when did you
finish law school?

140
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,295
5 years ago.

141
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,563
See, l'm having
a little trouble

142
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,797
with the bar exam.

143
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,896
I sat for it 6 times.

144
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:41,905
l'm sorry to hear that.

145
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:42,941
Yeah. When do you
take yours?

146
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,941
I take it
in, like, 3 weeks.

147
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,942
Oh, yeah.

148
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,978
lt's that hard?

149
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,376
Pretty rough,
l'll say.

150
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,641
I took it a year ago.

151
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,205
I don't think l'm gonna
take it again.

152
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,148
Anyway, this is
Bruiser's law library.

153
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,378
lf you want
to get anything

154
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,387
out of the fridge
or use the fridge,

155
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,320
you can put
your name on stuff.

156
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,018
They'll eat it anyway.
Put that in for me.

157
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,754
Aw, it's only rice.
What the hell. Daisy.

158
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,760
Daisy: Yeah.

159
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,558
We made a mess here.
Get that up, huh?

160
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,562
Sure, Deck.

161
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,791
Anyway...

162
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,993
So wait, what happens
when you have to go to court?

163
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,229
l've actually gone
a few times myself.

164
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,271
I haven't
gotten caught.

165
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,430
There's so many
lawyers here,

166
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,838
it's impossible
to keep up with us.

167
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,408
Bruiser owns all this.

168
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,140
Oh. Nice.

169
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,478
You can't call it
a firm exactly.

170
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,540
lt's every man
for himself.

171
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,949
You'll learn.

172
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,355
What, are you moving?

173
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,948
Evicted.

174
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,556
Here's the policy.

175
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,598
Yeah.

176
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,654
What do you think?

177
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,099
Well, this is
the scratch-and-sniff armpit

178
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,227
of the industry.

179
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,066
What are their grounds
for denial?

180
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,128
Oh, well, everything.

181
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,073
They first denied it
just on principle,

182
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,135
and then they said
that leukemia

183
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,270
was a pre-existing
condition,

184
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,279
and then they said

185
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,111
leukemia wasn't covered
in the policy.

186
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,480
I got 7 letters here.

187
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,542
Have all the premiums
been paid?

188
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,609
According to Miss Black,

189
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,086
she paid every
single one of them.

190
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,680
The bastards.

191
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,523
This is a typical
debit insurance scam.

192
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,994
The blacks call it
street-surance.

193
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,827
So what do I do?

194
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,233
You sign 'em up.
Sign 'em all up.

195
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,498
To J. Lyman Stone.

196
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,130
All right.

197
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,198
Yeah. l'll help you
on this one.

198
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,436
All right.
Well, thank you.

199
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,534
I appreciate it.

200
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,203
There's nothing
more thrilling

201
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,306
than nailing
an insurance company.

[Dog Barking]

203

Hi, Ms. Black.
lt's Rudy Baylor.

204
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,028
Remember?
l'm handling your case

205
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,231
against Great Benefit.

206
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,274
I met you

207
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,935
over at the Memphis
State Law Workshop.

208
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,238
Well, come in.

209
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,748
Come in. l'm sorry
about them crazy dogs.

210
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,112
Oh, that's ok.

211
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,208
I thought you was
a Jehovah's Witness.

212
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,217
Rudy: Where's Buddy?

213
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,947
He's out in the car.

214
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,319
Where's he going?

215
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,415
Buddy isn't going
nowhere.

216
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,222
He ain't right
in the head. War injury.

217
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,195
Korea. You know
them metal detectors

218
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,424
at the airport?

219
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,433
He can walk through one
buck naked,

220
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,729
and the thing
would go off.

221
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,032
He's got a plate
in his head.

222
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,833
Oh.

223
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,238
That's awful.

224
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,168
How's Donny Ray?

225
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,180
Well, good days and bad.

"Plate in head."

00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,944
You want to meet him?

228
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,416
Maybe later.

229
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,009
Um, now...

230
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:48,688
Great Benefit first denied
your claim last August

231
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,161
when Donny Ray was diagnosed.

232
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,131
Why'd y'all wait till now
to consult a lawyer?

233
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,293
Stupid, I guess.

234
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,802
I just kept
writing 'em,

235
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,770
and they kept
writing me back,

236
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,273
and this here
is the latest one.

"Dear Mrs. Black,

this company had denied
your claim in writing.

240
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,348
We now deny it for the eighth
and final time.

241
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,047
You must be stupid,

Gonna make 'em pay, huh?

00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,273

Well, before we can
file a claim,

he wasn't.

he comes in,

and some days
he don't.

259

Well, this is a contract.

260
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,998

of the case for you.

Mm-hmm.

2 pages to say all that?

about your estate.

329
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,069
Now, if you're not careful,
Miss Birdie,

330
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,733
the government is just gonna
get a big chunk of this.

331
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,333
Now, a lot of these taxes
can be avoided

332
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,106
with a little bit
of careful estate planning.

333
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,341
Oh, that legal
gobbledygook.

334
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,315
I suppose
you want your name

335
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,874
in the will
somewhere.

336
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,146
Of course not.

337
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,051
Lawyers are always
wanting their names

338
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,214
in my wills.

339
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,123
No, ma'am. Well, there are
all kinds of lawyers.

340
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,821
What I do need from you is,
for purposes of estate planning,

341
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,955
I do need to know
where the money is.

342
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,694
ls it in bonds
or stocks or cash?

343
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,226
Now, Rudy, not so fast,
not so fast.

344
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:32,266
Ok, ma'am. So we have
this money somewhere.

345
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,437
Who are we gonna
leave it to?

346
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,480
Well,

347
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,379
I want it all to go

348
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,882
to the Reverend
Kenneth Chandler.

349
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:39,883
Do you know him?

350
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,113
He's on television
all the time now

351
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,382
out of Dallas.

352
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,719
Got this curly
gray hair premature,

353
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,849
and he wouldn't
dream

354
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,223
of touching it up,
you know?

355
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,161
I want him
to have the money.

356
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,495
Forgive me,
Miss Birdie. Um...

357
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,262
What?

358
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,633
I just have a real problem

359
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,901
drafting a will
or any instrument

360
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,171
that's gonna cut out family

361
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,144
and that's gonna replace it

362
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,841
and convey
the bulk of this estate

363
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,009
to a TV personality.

364
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,187
Well, he's a man of God.

365
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,780
I realize that.

366
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,018
I know.

367
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,892
ls there any way we could
attack this in more of a--

368
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,658
Do you have to give him
everything?

369
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,258
Could it be more,
say, 25%?

370
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,599
He's got
a lot of overhead,

371
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,638
and his jet
is getting old.

372
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,139
His jet is getting old?

373
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,799
Now, Rudy, I want you
to just please

374
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,207
draw it up
the way I ask

375
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,301
and bring it back to me

376
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,006
so I can review it,
all right?

377
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,309
Here's the hustlers

378
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,646
when they were still
young and sweet.

379
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,276
Cut, cut, cut.

380
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,655
You come back now, huh?

381
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,160
Oh, I will, I will.

382
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,786
Thank you.

383
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,262
No. Thank you.

384
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,563
ls that a little
apartment back there?

385
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,933
Used to be.

386
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,335
What do you think
about my garden?

387
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,635
Oh, that's
a fine-looking garden.

388
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,299
Do you do all the work
on this yourself?

389
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,741
Most of it.

390
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,176
I pay a young boy to cut
the grass for me once a week.

391
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,237
$30. Can you believe it?

392
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,613
Used to be 5.

393
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,242
Well, I don't suppose
you'd be interested

394
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,911
in renting this place
out now, would you?

395
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,750
I couldn't afford much,
though.

396
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,689
I could let you have it
quite reasonably

397
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,784
if you'd assist me with a few
chores around the place.

398
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,294
Sure, sure.

399
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,160
Perhaps a little weed pulling
now and then.

400
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,030
Sure. Weed pulling's
my specialty.

401
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,499
Go to hospitals
all the time.

402
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,166
Bruiser has contacts
down at the main precinct,

403
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,334
guys he grew up with.

404
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,571
They feed him accident
reports every morning.

405
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,044
Can I ask you
something?

406
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,102
Sure.

407
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,548
What does Bruiser
expect me to do?

408
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,347
Get the case.
You find the victims.

409
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,253
You sign 'em up to the law firm
of J. Lyman Stone.

410
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,620
Put the case together.

411
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,659
So I should solicit?

412
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,694
What did they teach you
in law school?

413
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,887
Well, they didn't
teach me

414
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,157
how to chase
ambulances.

415
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,198
Well, you better learn quick,
or you're gonna starve.

416
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,432
All you have to do
is ask for a doctor

417
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,872
and we can admit you
right here. Sure.

418
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,068
Nice flowers.

419
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,474
Thanks.

420
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,603
William.

421
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,611
How you doing, Deck?

422
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,705
All right. 346.

423
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,985
Dr. Wells.

424
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,019
Morning.

425
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,248
How are you?
Good to see you.

426
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,882
Don't act
like a lawyer.

427
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,564
Hmm. "Do not enter."

428
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,699
How you doing,
Mr. McKenzie?

429
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,867
How are my tests?

430
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,846
Gall bladder.
Wrong fish.

431
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,280
Mr. Van Landel.

432
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,080
Good afternoon,
Mr. Van Landel.

433
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,881
Can you hear me,
Mr. Van Landel?

434
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,050
Hi.

435
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,491
Who are you?

436
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,357
l'm Deck Schifflet,
para-lawyer.

437
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,487
You haven't talked

438
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,894
to any insurance
companies, have you?

439
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,897
No.

440
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,331
Good. Don't talk to 'em

441
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,459
because they're just
out to screw you.

442
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,502
Do you have a lawyer?

443
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,729
No.

444
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,204
My firm
handles more car wrecks

445
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,570
than anybody in Memphis.

446
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,132
lnsurance companies
are terrified of us,

447
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,178
and we don't
charge a dime.

448
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,043
Can you wait
till my wife gets back?

449
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,172
Your wife, Mr. Van--

450
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,238
Ow!

451
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,580
Aah!

452
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,210
Sorry.

453
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,346
l'm very sorry,
Mr. Van Landel.

454
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,788
Very sorry.

455
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,325
Where is your wife,
Mr. Van Landel?

456
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,554
She'll be back
in a little while.

457
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,596
Well, l'm gonna
have to talk to her

458
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,823
down in my office

459
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,162
because there's a ton of
information that I need.

460
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,427
Just sign right there.

461
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,196
Remember,
don't talk to anybody

462
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,362
except your doctor.

463
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,905
There are gonna be
people coming at you

464
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,904
from every direction

465
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,497
offering you
settlements.

466
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,009
I do not want you
under any circumstances

467
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,171
to sign anything without
me reviewing it first.

468
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,043
Understand? My number
is on this card.

469
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,946
You can call me
24 hours a day.

470
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,315
Mr. Rudy Baylor's number
is on the back.

471
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,378
You can call that number
for him any time, ok?

472
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,423
Do you have
any questions?

473
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,514
No.

474
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,458
Good. We're gonna get
you a bunch of money.

475
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,085
Let's go.

476
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,857
l'm real sorry
about your leg.

477
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,425
l'd like to be alone please.

478
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,766
And that
is how it's done.

479
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,603
Piece of cake.

480
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,166
What if the guy
had a lawyer?

481
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,269
We came with nothing.

482
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,745
lf he'd have thrown us
out of his room

483
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,044
for whatever reason,
what have we lost?

484
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,550
A little dignity.

485
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,984
Maybe a little self-respect.

486
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,682
You see...

487
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,018
in law school, Rudy,

488
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,581
they don't teach you
what you need to know.

489
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,820
lt's all theories
and lofty notions

490
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,090

Rudy: ln my first year
at law school,

672
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,962
everybody loved
everybody else

673
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,029
because we were all
studying the law,

674
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,574
and the law
was a noble thing.

675
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,439
By my third year,

676
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,241

murdered in your sleep.

People stole exams,

678
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,779
hid research materials
from the library,

679
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,477
and lied to the professors.

680

Rudy: Half an hour ago,
her husband came in...

683
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,100
and threw a bowl
of soup at her

684
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,103
because she just won't
get it through her head

This is my room.

687
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,133
Pregnant at 18, married,
then a miscarriage--

688
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,145
probably because
he beat her up--

689
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,238
and still,
she can't leave him.

Everything l've ever seen

692
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,317

is a loser,

693
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,221
scarred and broken
and maybe even dangerous,

694
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,089
but l've never really seen
anyone like her before,

695
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,320
and instead of running away,

696
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,853
all I want to do
is protect her.

697

So...

700
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,341
He should be shot.

701
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,680
Any man who'd beat his wife
with an aluminum bat

702
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,946
needs to be shot.

703
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,622
How did you find out?

704
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,920
There are police reports,
there are ambulance reports,

705

to hit you in the head

708
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,758
with that bat of his?

709
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,961
'Cause that could kill you,
you know. That'd be it.

710
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,401
A couple of good shots

Look at me, Kelly.

714
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,347
Can I ask you something?

715
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,152
Do you have a father
or a brother?

716
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,155
Why?

717
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,524
Because if my daughter

718
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,360
got beat the way
your husband beat you,

719
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,798
I swear to god
l'd break his neck.

Why not?

731

about being arrested.

00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,307
Get a license!

980
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,366
Come back when you
got a damn license!

981
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,503
May it
please the court...

982
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,878
for the record, my name
is Leo F. Drummond

983
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,714
of Tinley-Brit,

984
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,185
counsel
for Great Benefit,

985
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,687
and I say

986
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,247
if this young man
has passed the bar exam,

987
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,022
Your Honor, let him
argue the case.

988
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:22,122
We welcome him to, uh,
big-time litigation.

989
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,793
You have no objection,
Mr. Drummond?

990
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,836
Drummond:
lf it please the court,

991
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,532
I would be honored
to introduce Mr. Baylor

992
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,938
to the practice of law

993
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,703
in the great state
of Tennessee.

994
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,540
Judge, you can give him
the oath right now,

995
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,480
and l'll be pleased
to stand for him.

996
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,575
Are you certain you're prepared
to proceed, Mr. Baylor?

00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,450
Abso--[Feedback]

998
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,251
Yeah. Your Honor, yes.

999
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:50,589
Judge Hale: Very well, then.
Raise your right hand.

1000
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,526
Do you solemnly swear,
Rudy Baylor,

1001
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,030
that you will support
the constitution and the laws

1002
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,794

and the state of Tennessee

1003
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,129
faithfully and honorably,

1004
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,193
conduct yourself in the practice
of your profession

1005
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,671
to the best of your skills
and abilities, so help you God?

1006
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,542
I do.

1007
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,046
Ok, fine, fine. That's it.
Let's move on. [Coughs]

1008
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,411
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1009
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,744
Welcome to the war.

1010
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,479
Rudy: Sworn in by a fool
and vouched for by a scoundrel.

1011

Harvey.

1012
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,215
l'm a lawyer at last.

1013
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,722
Judge Hale: Come on in.

1014
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,589
May I, Harv?

1015
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,063
Sure.

1016
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,998
Uh, sit down.

1017
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,528
Um...

1018
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,367
This lawsuit bothers me,
Mr. Baylor.

1019
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,639
I wouldn't use the word
"frivolous,"

1020
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,409
but l'm not impressed
with the merits of it,

1021
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,847
to be frank.

1022
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,909
Drummond: Ahem. l'm gonna try
to sneak some gym time in.

1023
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,285
ln fact, l'm really tired
of these type of lawsuits.

1024
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,880
Don't make no excuses.

1025
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,228
l'm inclined to grant
the motion to dismiss.

1026
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:03,562
Now, you can, uh, refile it
in federal court, you know,

1027
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,262
take it somewhere else.
[Coughs]

1028
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,271
I don't want it
clogging up my docket.

1029
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,637
Now, excuse me
while I go to the can.

1030
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,006
You, too.

1031
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,212
Rudy...

1032
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,752
l'm a very expensive lawyer

1033
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,118
from a very expensive firm,
and, uh...

1034
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,089
l've had a lot of cases.

1035
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,682
I can hit pretty close to
the center of the dart board,

1036
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,729
and I told my clients,
Great Benefit,

1037
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,197
that cost alone here
gonna be a big deal.

1038
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,064
And for you, too.
Your side, too.

1039
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:42,435
Now, they've
authorized me...

1040
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:46,704
to offer you
and your clients...

1041
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,809
$50,000 to settle
this thing out.

1042
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:55,818
And I--I may even be able
to raise that figure up

1043
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:59,879
as high as, uh,
maybe 75,000.

1044
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,084
No admission of liability,
you understand.

1045
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,629
Course, uh...

1046
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,062
if you say no,

1047
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:11,226
then it's going
to be World War lll.

1048
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,359
[Chuckles]

1049
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,904
My turn now.
May I, Harv?

1050
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,668
Sure.

1051
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,074
Uh...

1052
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,537
[Door Closes]

1053
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,878
There's not much
of a lawsuit here,

1054
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,416
l'm afraid, son.

1055
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,749
But maybe I could
lean on Leo

1056
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,051
to make you an offer
of a settlement.

1057
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,023
They'll probably want
to throw some money at you

1058
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,526
to keep from paying Leo
a thousand bucks a minute.

1059
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,027
[Coughing]

1060
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:43,396
But he already offered me
the cost of the defense.

1061
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,368
Oh, really?
How much?

1062
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:49,132
Uh, 75,000.

1063
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,902
Jeez.

1064
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,068
Well, looky here, son,

1065
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,045
you'd be crazy
not to take that.

1066
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,914
You think so?

1067
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,577
75,000? Jeez.

1068
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,848
That's a...
That's a bunch of money.

1069
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,321
Doesn't sound like Leo.

1070
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,950
Well, he's a--
He's a great guy.

1071
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,617
Hmm.

1072
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,924
Whoo.

1073
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,301
So?

1074
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,767
That was not a meeting
in chambers.

1075
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,304
That was an ambush.

1076
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,269
What happened?

1077
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,704
They tag-teamed me.

1078
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,798
Yeah.

1079
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,775
Think they would have
done that to Bruiser?

1080
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,311
Nah. Bruiser's
too savvy for that.

1081
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,276
So what?

1082
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,973
They offered me
75,000.

1083
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,481
Good. Take it.

1084
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,847
Our third is 25,000.

1085
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,317
We need the money.

1086
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,320
Judge Hale is serious
about dismissing this case.

1087
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,787
He's an just
an old angry man

1088
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,290
who's been sitting
on that bench too long.

1089
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,758
The best thing we can do
is grab what we can

00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,454
to make things easy
on his parents.

1091
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,131
The insurance company
made an offer to settle.

1092
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,326
What kind of offer?

1093
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,801
$75,000.

that's what it's gonna cost

1095
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,075
to pay their lawyers
to defend the case.

Dot: Oh.

1097
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,538
Son of a bitches think
they can just buy us off.

1098
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,707
That's exactly
what they think.

1099
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,385
You better talk to him.

1100
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,727
Do you wanna settle,
Rudy?

1101
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,397
I mean, some of the money
is yours.

1102
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,633
No way.

1103
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,405
I wanna expose
these people.

a glass of water, please?

of this case,

I can't help thinking

1110

that while we're all out there
scrambling around for an edge

1111

like we're never gonna die,

looking right at it,

and he's doing it
almost alone.

to imagine the courage
it must take.

You know what
a rainmaker is kid?

What's the problem?

Well, Your Honor, uh...

been ruled upon

Let me ask you something,
Mr. Drummond.

1162

I told him...

1301
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,702
I know. Come here,
come here, come here.

1302
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,715
Don't worry about it.
lt's just a deposition.

1303

Donny Ray,
l'm Leo Drummond.

1304
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,451
I represent
Great Benefit,

1305
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,579
and l'm very sorry...

1306
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,213
l'm very sorry
to be here

1307
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,780
under these
circumstances.

1308
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,291
Well, we wouldn't be here

1309
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,225
if your clients had done
what they should've done.

1310
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,092
Drummond: I beg your pardon?
I didn't hear that.

1311
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,096
Hey, kid,

1312
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,723
you want a stick
of gum?

1313
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,732
Sure.

1314
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,268
Here. Did you break
your arm?

1315
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:20,597
Yep.

1316
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,103
You had an accident?

1317
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,070
Why?

1318
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,232
Well, l'm a lawyer,
and, uh...

1319
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,742
Give this to your mom--
You his mom?

1320
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,507
Maybe I can get you some
money for the accident.

1321
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,590
Manager: Why don't you
help with the display?

1322
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,257
Ok. l'll go help
this man first.

1323
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,425
Oh, no. I got it.
lt's fine.

1324
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,269
Can I help you,
sir?

1325
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,832
Oh, l'm just looking.

1326
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,298
There's a cinema
down the street.

1327
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,301
Buy a ticket.
Center section, back row.

1328
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:27,961
Be there in 30 minutes.

1329
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:30,634
Ok.

1330
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,842
Cliff wants me
to have a baby.

1331
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,015
Well, you have
a decision to make.

1332
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,556
He's become obsessed
with sex.

1333
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,887
He thinks it's going
to keep us together.

1334
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,395
Listen, I really don't
want to talk about that.

1335
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,522
I just wanted to see you.

1336
01:00:14,954 --> 01:00:16,888
Rudy: I think
I can smell her perfume

1337
01:00:16,956 --> 01:00:18,924
all the way to Cleveland.

1338
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:22,222
lt's hard keeping my mind on
Leo Drummond and his people.

1339
01:00:23,229 --> 01:00:24,719
They'll be flying in,
first class,

1340
01:00:24,797 --> 01:00:26,424
and after
a leisurely dinner,

1341
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:28,399
they'll meet
in some board room

1342
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:29,957
and discuss
my total destruction.

1343
01:00:30,036 --> 01:00:32,004
Around the time
l'm checking into Motel 6,

1344
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:34,096
they'll be sleeping soundly
in their suites.

1345
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:37,142
And they'll wake up
fresh and rested

1346
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:39,109
and ready for war.

1347
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:41,146
lt's my deposition,

1348
01:00:41,213 --> 01:00:43,272
but it's their turf.

1349
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:45,983
Ah, young Rudy Baylor.

1350
01:00:46,052 --> 01:00:47,451
Just on time, too.

1351
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,452
Mr. Drummond.

1352
01:00:48,521 --> 01:00:50,512
Get this boy
some coffee, Tyler.

1353

1354

1355

Young lawyer is always
a hungry lawyer.

1356
01:00:53,893 --> 01:00:56,327
All these boys claims,
underwriting...

1357
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:58,192
Rudy: There must be
a 100 years of legal experience

1358
01:00:58,264 --> 01:00:59,822
gathered around the table.

1359
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:03,357
My staff has flunked
the bar exam 6 times.

1360
01:01:03,436 --> 01:01:04,835
Now, Rudy,
don't be intimidated

1361
01:01:04,904 --> 01:01:06,872
by all these boys on
this side of the table.

1362
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:08,839
I guarantee, you get
them on the golf course,

1363
01:01:08,908 --> 01:01:11,001
they fold
like a cheap suit.

1364
01:01:12,445 --> 01:01:13,343
Let's see.

1365
01:01:13,412 --> 01:01:15,710
Let's see
what we got here.

1366
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:18,648
I think maybe it's, uh,
appropriate

1367
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:21,687
to start with
the corporate designee,

1368
01:01:21,754 --> 01:01:23,153
Jack Underhall here.

1369
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:25,486
Rudy:
I--I don't think so.

1370
01:01:26,425 --> 01:01:27,687
I beg your pardon?

1371
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,784
Well, you heard me.

1372
01:01:28,861 --> 01:01:30,328
I want to start with,
uh, Jackie Lemancyzk,

1373
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:31,658
the claims handler.

1374
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,470
I think it's best we start
with Mr. Underhall.

1375
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,208
With all due respect,
Mr. Drummond,

1376
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:44,708
this is my deposition.

1377
01:01:44,777 --> 01:01:47,371
l'm gonna call these witnesses
in the order in which I see fit,

1378
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:50,677
so l'd like to start
with Jackie Lemancyzk.

1379
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:55,443
Maybe we should just
go call the judge.

1380
01:01:57,256 --> 01:02:00,191
Oh, I don't believe
we have to get pugilistic

1381
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:01,783
this time of the morning.

1382
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:04,159
l'm not admitting
to being pugilistic.

1383
01:02:05,197 --> 01:02:07,188
We're simply having
a little problem

1384
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,234
with, uh,
Jackie Lemancyzk.

1385
01:02:09,301 --> 01:02:11,132
Uh, this Polish woman.

1386
01:02:11,203 --> 01:02:13,068
What sort of problem?

1387
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:17,432
She doesn't work here
anymore.

1388
01:02:18,377 --> 01:02:19,605
Was she fired?

1389
01:02:19,678 --> 01:02:21,703
She resigned.

1390
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:24,010
She resigned.

1391
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:26,677
Um, well,
where is she now?

1392
01:02:26,752 --> 01:02:28,049
Well...

1393
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,521
she is no longer working
for our client, and, uh,

1394
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,252
we can't produce her
as a witness,

1395
01:02:34,326 --> 01:02:37,659
so let's move along.

1396
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,899
All right.
Russell Crockett.

1397
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:44,231
Anybody in the room
named Russell Crockett?

1398
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:48,797
He's gone, too.

1399
01:02:48,874 --> 01:02:50,774
He was downsized.

1400
01:02:50,843 --> 01:02:52,037
Downsized?

1401
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:54,272
Well, what a coincidence.

1402
01:02:54,346 --> 01:02:56,746
Our client's going through
a periodic downsizing.

1403
01:02:56,816 --> 01:02:58,716
Yeah, that will happen,
won't it?

1404

Has he been downsized,
too?

1407
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:15,098
No, he's here.

You're Everett Lufkin?

1409

Mm-hmm.
