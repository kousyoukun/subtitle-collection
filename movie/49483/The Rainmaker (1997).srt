1
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,265
Rudy Baylor: My father
hated lawyers all his life.

2
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,071
He wasn't a great guy,
my old man.

3
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,510
He drank
and beat up my mother.

4
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,376
He beat me up, too.

5
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,348
So you might think
I became a lawyer

6
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,078
just to piss him off,

7
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,120
but you'd be wrong.

8
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,212
l've wanted to be a lawyer

9
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,916
ever since I read about
the civil rights lawyers

10
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,618
in the fifties and sixties

11
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,024
and the amazing uses
they found for the law.

12
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,256
They did what a lot
of people thought

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,957
was the impossible.

14
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,523
They gave lawyers
a good name.

15
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,229
And so I went
to law school,

16
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,101
and it did
piss my father off,

17
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,038
but he was pissed off
anyway.

18
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,099
ln my first year,
he got drunk one day

19
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,166
and fell of a ladder

20
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,508
manufactured by the company
he worked for,

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,048
and he didn't know
who to sue first.

22
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,550
Now, he died a couple
months after that.

23
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,052
l'm empty.

24
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,645
Rudy: Now, some
of my classmates,

25
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,815
they knew they were going
straight from school

26
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,483
into the top law firms,

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,120
thanks mostly to their
family connections.

28
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,390
Now, the only
connections I had

29
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,989
were made in the places
where I tended bar for 3 years

30
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,226
so I could pay my tuition.

31
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,132
And while I still had plans

32
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,761
to shine the blazing
light of justice

33
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,827
into every dark corner,

34
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,772
what I really needed
right now was a job,

35
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,900
and badly,

36
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,570
because there are too many
lawyers in Memphis.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,179
[Siren]

38
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,407
This city's
infested with them.

39
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,784
Second Man:
I don't think so.

40
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,793
Rudy: I can't think of
anything more embarrassing

41
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,055
than telling people

42
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,394
I work for a guy
like Bruiser Stone.

43
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,161
Man: I mean, he's a lawyer,
and they call him Bruiser.

44
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,832
That's how desperate I am.

45
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:21,874
Sure.

46
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,841
Shut the door.

47
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,811
Bruiser: No, not that.
Not that either.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,576
Sure.

49
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,581
Sure.

50
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,448
Let's make it my house.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,886
Ok.

52
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,714
I really pity
the poor FBl technician

53
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,521
that's gonna
have to extract the data

54
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,993
from that conversation.

55
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,292
Live sharks in
a lawyer's office.

56
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,299
lt's a joke.
Get it?

57
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,800
Bruiser: So, prince,

58
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,699
is this the law student
you were telling me about?

59
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,930
Yes, sir.
I just finished

60
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,768
my third year
at Memphis State.

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,307
Couldn't you use him
around here?

62
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,309
Look, l'll vouch for him.

63
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,810
The boy needs a job.

64
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,507
He's tended bar
at our clubs.

65
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,676
This'll be a great place
for you to work, Rudy.

66
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,413
This'll be...

67
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,318
a great place
for you to work.

68
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,880
You can see what
real lawyers do.

69
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,155
Now, it ain't exactly
a salaried position.

70
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,286
lt isn't?

71
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,093
I expect my associates
to pay for themselves--

72
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,260
generate their own fees.

73
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,701
Talk to me.

74
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,035
How exactly
does that work?

75
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,132
Well, Rudy,
you draw $1,000 a month,

76
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,179
and you get to keep 1/3 of all
the fees that you generate.

77
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,340
Now, if you can't
cover your draw

78
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,509
at the end of each month,
you owe me the balance.

79
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,553
Do you understand?

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,315
Sounds fair to me,
Rudy.

81
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,083
That's a hell
of a deal, really.

82
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,216
You can make a lot
of money this way.

83
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,281
Um...

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,918
Bruiser: l'll tell you
something, Rudy.

85
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,724
That's the only way
I operate.

86
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,424
And l'll get you
a lot of good cases.

87
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,262
I have cases.

88
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,700
Uh...

89
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,363
I have 2 cases
right now.

90
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,066
One is a will

91
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,471
that l'm drafting
for an old woman.

92
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,134
She's loaded, too.
She's worth millions.

93
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,269
And then I have
this other case.

94
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,506
lt's an insurance case.

95
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,674
Great Benefit.
You heard of 'em.

96
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,877
You got these clients signed?

97
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,079
l'm on my way
to see 'em right now,

98
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,815
and they'll listen
to me, too.

99
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,481
I helped 'em
over at a law workshop.

100
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,185
All right,
l'm gonna have you talk

101
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,091
to an associate of mine,
Deck Schifflet.

102
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,722
He used to work with these
big insurance companies.

103
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,528
He handles all the high-powered
stuff around here.

104
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,001
Hey, Deck!

105
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,196
Deck!

106
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,239
Damn it.

107
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,773
You got the paperwork
on this stuff?

108
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,739
ln my car.

109
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:36,832
Good.

110
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,967
[Door Opens]

111
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,748
Bruiser: Hey, good lookin'.

112
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,443
This is Deck Schifflet.

113
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,009
This man will get you
plugged in.

114
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,611
What I want you to do,

115
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,385
I want you to draw up a lawsuit
against this Great Benefit,

116
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,188
and you put my name on it.

117
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,956
We're gonna file it today.

118
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,361
Thank you.

119
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,490
Rudy, you're gonna
learn a lot.

120
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,091
Rudy, l'm glad
you came here.

121
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,103
You're making good
choices already, son.

122
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,331
All right,
well, thank you.

123
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,896
Ok, thank you.

124
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,601
Close the door on your
way out now, ok?

125
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,109
Woman: Law offices.
May I help you?

126
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,542
This is an office,
there's people in it.

127
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,909
lf there's somebody
in the office,

128
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,311
you can't have it,
it's off limits.

129
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,780
This is the bathroom.

130
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:17,781
Woman:
Just a minute.

131
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,408
Sorry.

132
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,146
So, are you
an associate here?

133
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,744
Sort of. Not really.

134
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,221
l'm actually
not a lawyer yet.

135
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,554
Bruiser usually asks me

136
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,389
to review the insurance cases
when they come in.

137
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,827
I used to work for Specific
Mutual lnsurance Company.

138
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,626
I got sick of that.
I went to law school.

139
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,031
Well, when did you
finish law school?

140
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,295
5 years ago.

141
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,563
See, l'm having
a little trouble

142
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,797
with the bar exam.

143
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,896
I sat for it 6 times.

144
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:41,905
l'm sorry to hear that.

145
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:42,941
Yeah. When do you
take yours?

146
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,941
I take it
in, like, 3 weeks.

147
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,942
Oh, yeah.

148
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,978
lt's that hard?

149
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,376
Pretty rough,
l'll say.

150
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,641
I took it a year ago.

151
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,205
I don't think l'm gonna
take it again.

152
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,148
Anyway, this is
Bruiser's law library.

153
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,378
lf you want
to get anything

154
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,387
out of the fridge
or use the fridge,

155
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,320
you can put
your name on stuff.

156
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,018
They'll eat it anyway.
Put that in for me.

157
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,754
Aw, it's only rice.
What the hell. Daisy.

158
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,760
Daisy: Yeah.

159
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,558
We made a mess here.
Get that up, huh?

160
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,562
Sure, Deck.

161
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,791
Anyway...

162
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,993
So wait, what happens
when you have to go to court?

163
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,229
l've actually gone
a few times myself.

164
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,271
I haven't
gotten caught.

165
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,430
There's so many
lawyers here,

166
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,838
it's impossible
to keep up with us.

167
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,408
Bruiser owns all this.

168
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,140
Oh. Nice.

169
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,478
You can't call it
a firm exactly.

170
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,540
lt's every man
for himself.

171
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,949
You'll learn.

172
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,355
What, are you moving?

173
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,948
Evicted.

174
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,556
Here's the policy.

175
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,598
Yeah.

176
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,654
What do you think?

177
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,099
Well, this is
the scratch-and-sniff armpit

178
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,227
of the industry.

179
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,066
What are their grounds
for denial?

180
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,128
Oh, well, everything.

181
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,073
They first denied it
just on principle,

182
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,135
and then they said
that leukemia

183
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,270
was a pre-existing
condition,

184
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,279
and then they said

185
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,111
leukemia wasn't covered
in the policy.

186
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,480
I got 7 letters here.

187
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,542
Have all the premiums
been paid?

188
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,609
According to Miss Black,

189
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,086
she paid every
single one of them.

190
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,680
The bastards.

191
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,523
This is a typical
debit insurance scam.

192
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,994
The blacks call it
street-surance.

193
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,827
So what do I do?

194
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,233
You sign 'em up.
Sign 'em all up.

195
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,498
To J. Lyman Stone.

196
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,130
All right.

197
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,198
Yeah. l'll help you
on this one.

198
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,436
All right.
Well, thank you.

199
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,534
I appreciate it.

200
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,203
There's nothing
more thrilling

201
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,306
than nailing
an insurance company.

[Dog Barking]

203

Hi, Ms. Black.
lt's Rudy Baylor.

204
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,028
Remember?
l'm handling your case

205
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,231
against Great Benefit.

206
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,274
I met you

207
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,935
over at the Memphis
State Law Workshop.

208
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,238
Well, come in.

209
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,748
Come in. l'm sorry
about them crazy dogs.

210
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,112
Oh, that's ok.

211
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,208
I thought you was
a Jehovah's Witness.

212
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,217
Rudy: Where's Buddy?

213
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,947
He's out in the car.

214
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,319
Where's he going?

215
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,415
Buddy isn't going
nowhere.

216
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,222
He ain't right
in the head. War injury.

217
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,195
Korea. You know
them metal detectors

218
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,424
at the airport?

219
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,433
He can walk through one
buck naked,

220
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,729
and the thing
would go off.

221
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,032
He's got a plate
in his head.

222
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,833
Oh.

223
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,238
That's awful.

224
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,168
How's Donny Ray?

225
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,180
Well, good days and bad.

"Plate in head."

00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,944
You want to meet him?

228
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,416
Maybe later.

229
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,009
Um, now...

230
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:48,688
Great Benefit first denied
your claim last August

231
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,161
when Donny Ray was diagnosed.

232
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,131
Why'd y'all wait till now
to consult a lawyer?

233
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,293
Stupid, I guess.

234
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,802
I just kept
writing 'em,

235
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,770
and they kept
writing me back,

236
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,273
and this here
is the latest one.

"Dear Mrs. Black,

this company had denied
your claim in writing.

240
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,348
We now deny it for the eighth
and final time.

241
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,047
You must be stupid,

Gonna make 'em pay, huh?

00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,273

Well, before we can
file a claim,

he wasn't.

he comes in,

and some days
he don't.

259

Well, this is a contract.

260
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,998

of the case for you.

Mm-hmm.

2 pages to say all that?

about your estate.

329
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,069
Now, if you're not careful,
Miss Birdie,

330
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,733
the government is just gonna
get a big chunk of this.

331
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,333
Now, a lot of these taxes
can be avoided

332
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,106
with a little bit
of careful estate planning.

333
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,341
Oh, that legal
gobbledygook.

334
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,315
I suppose
you want your name

335
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,874
in the will
somewhere.

336
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,146
Of course not.

337
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,051
Lawyers are always
wanting their names

338
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,214
in my wills.

339
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,123
No, ma'am. Well, there are
all kinds of lawyers.

340
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,821
What I do need from you is,
for purposes of estate planning,

341
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,955
I do need to know
where the money is.

342
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,694
ls it in bonds
or stocks or cash?

343
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,226
Now, Rudy, not so fast,
not so fast.

344
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:32,266
Ok, ma'am. So we have
this money somewhere.

345
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,437
Who are we gonna
leave it to?

346
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,480
Well,

347
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,379
I want it all to go

348
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,882
to the Reverend
Kenneth Chandler.

349
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:39,883
Do you know him?

350
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,113
He's on television
all the time now

351
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,382
out of Dallas.

352
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,719
Got this curly
gray hair premature,

353
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,849
and he wouldn't
dream

354
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,223
of touching it up,
you know?

355
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,161
I want him
to have the money.

356
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,495
Forgive me,
Miss Birdie. Um...

357
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,262
What?

358
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,633
I just have a real problem

359
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,901
drafting a will
or any instrument

360
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,171
that's gonna cut out family

361
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,144
and that's gonna replace it

362
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,841
and convey
the bulk of this estate

363
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,009
to a TV personality.

364
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,187
Well, he's a man of God.

365
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,780
I realize that.

366
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,018
I know.

367
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,892
ls there any way we could
attack this in more of a--

368
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,658
Do you have to give him
everything?

369
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,258
Could it be more,
say, 25%?

370
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,599
He's got
a lot of overhead,

371
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,638
and his jet
is getting old.

372
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,139
His jet is getting old?

373
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,799
Now, Rudy, I want you
to just please

374
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,207
draw it up
the way I ask

375
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,301
and bring it back to me

376
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,006
so I can review it,
all right?

377
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,309
Here's the hustlers

378
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,646
when they were still
young and sweet.

379
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,276
Cut, cut, cut.

380
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,655
You come back now, huh?

381
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,160
Oh, I will, I will.

382
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,786
Thank you.

383
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,262
No. Thank you.

384
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,563
ls that a little
apartment back there?

385
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,933
Used to be.

386
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,335
What do you think
about my garden?

387
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,635
Oh, that's
a fine-looking garden.

388
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,299
Do you do all the work
on this yourself?

389
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,741
Most of it.

390
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,176
I pay a young boy to cut
the grass for me once a week.

391
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,237
$30. Can you believe it?

392
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,613
Used to be 5.

393
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,242
Well, I don't suppose
you'd be interested

394
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,911
in renting this place
out now, would you?

395
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,750
I couldn't afford much,
though.

396
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,689
I could let you have it
quite reasonably

397
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,784
if you'd assist me with a few
chores around the place.

398
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,294
Sure, sure.

399
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,160
Perhaps a little weed pulling
now and then.

400
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,030
Sure. Weed pulling's
my specialty.

401
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,499
Go to hospitals
all the time.

402
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,166
Bruiser has contacts
down at the main precinct,

403
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,334
guys he grew up with.

404
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,571
They feed him accident
reports every morning.

405
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,044
Can I ask you
something?

406
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,102
Sure.

407
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,548
What does Bruiser
expect me to do?

408
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,347
Get the case.
You find the victims.

409
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,253
You sign 'em up to the law firm
of J. Lyman Stone.

410
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,620
Put the case together.

411
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,659
So I should solicit?

412
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,694
What did they teach you
in law school?

413
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,887
Well, they didn't
teach me

414
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,157
how to chase
ambulances.

415
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,198
Well, you better learn quick,
or you're gonna starve.

416
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,432
All you have to do
is ask for a doctor

417
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,872
and we can admit you
right here. Sure.

418
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,068
Nice flowers.

419
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,474
Thanks.

420
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,603
William.

421
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,611
How you doing, Deck?

422
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,705
All right. 346.

423
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,985
Dr. Wells.

424
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,019
Morning.

425
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,248
How are you?
Good to see you.

426
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,882
Don't act
like a lawyer.

427
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,564
Hmm. "Do not enter."

428
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,699
How you doing,
Mr. McKenzie?

429
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,867
How are my tests?

430
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,846
Gall bladder.
Wrong fish.

431
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,280
Mr. Van Landel.

432
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,080
Good afternoon,
Mr. Van Landel.

433
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,881
Can you hear me,
Mr. Van Landel?

434
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,050
Hi.

435
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,491
Who are you?

436
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,357
l'm Deck Schifflet,
para-lawyer.

437
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,487
You haven't talked

438
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,894
to any insurance
companies, have you?

439
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,897
No.

440
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,331
Good. Don't talk to 'em

441
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,459
because they're just
out to screw you.

442
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,502
Do you have a lawyer?

443
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,729
No.

444
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,204
My firm
handles more car wrecks

445
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,570
than anybody in Memphis.

446
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,132
lnsurance companies
are terrified of us,

447
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,178
and we don't
charge a dime.

448
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,043
Can you wait
till my wife gets back?

449
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,172
Your wife, Mr. Van--

450
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,238
Ow!

451
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,580
Aah!

452
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,210
Sorry.

453
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,346
l'm very sorry,
Mr. Van Landel.

454
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,788
Very sorry.

455
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,325
Where is your wife,
Mr. Van Landel?

456
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,554
She'll be back
in a little while.

457
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,596
Well, l'm gonna
have to talk to her

458
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,823
down in my office

459
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,162
because there's a ton of
information that I need.

460
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,427
Just sign right there.

461
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,196
Remember,
don't talk to anybody

462
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,362
except your doctor.

463
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,905
There are gonna be
people coming at you

464
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,904
from every direction

465
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,497
offering you
settlements.

466
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,009
I do not want you
under any circumstances

467
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,171
to sign anything without
me reviewing it first.

468
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,043
Understand? My number
is on this card.

469
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,946
You can call me
24 hours a day.

470
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,315
Mr. Rudy Baylor's number
is on the back.

471
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,378
You can call that number
for him any time, ok?

472
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,423
Do you have
any questions?

473
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,514
No.

474
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,458
Good. We're gonna get
you a bunch of money.

475
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,085
Let's go.

476
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,857
l'm real sorry
about your leg.

477
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,425
l'd like to be alone please.

478
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,766
And that
is how it's done.

479
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,603
Piece of cake.

480
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,166
What if the guy
had a lawyer?

481
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,269
We came with nothing.

482
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,745
lf he'd have thrown us
out of his room

483
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,044
for whatever reason,
what have we lost?

484
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,550
A little dignity.

485
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,984
Maybe a little self-respect.

486
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,682
You see...

487
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,018
in law school, Rudy,

488
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,581
they don't teach you
what you need to know.

489
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,820
lt's all theories
and lofty notions

490
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,090

Rudy: ln my first year
at law school,

672
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,962
everybody loved
everybody else

673
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,029
because we were all
studying the law,

674
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,574
and the law
was a noble thing.

675
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,439
By my third year,

676
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,241

murdered in your sleep.

People stole exams,

678
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,779
hid research materials
from the library,

679
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,477
and lied to the professors.

680

Rudy: Half an hour ago,
her husband came in...

683
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,100
and threw a bowl
of soup at her

684
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,103
because she just won't
get it through her head

This is my room.

687
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,133
Pregnant at 18, married,
then a miscarriage--

688
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,145
probably because
he beat her up--

689
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,238
and still,
she can't leave him.

Everything l've ever seen

692
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,317

is a loser,

693
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,221
scarred and broken
and maybe even dangerous,

694
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,089
but l've never really seen
anyone like her before,

695
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,320
and instead of running away,

696
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,853
all I want to do
is protect her.

697

So...

700
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,341
He should be shot.

701
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,680
Any man who'd beat his wife
with an aluminum bat

702
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,946
needs to be shot.

703
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,622
How did you find out?

704
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,920
There are police reports,
there are ambulance reports,

705

to hit you in the head

708
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,758
with that bat of his?

709
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,961
'Cause that could kill you,
you know. That'd be it.

710
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,401
A couple of good shots

Look at me, Kelly.

714
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,347
Can I ask you something?

715
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,152
Do you have a father
or a brother?

716
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,155
Why?

717
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,524
Because if my daughter

718
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,360
got beat the way
your husband beat you,

719
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,798
I swear to god
l'd break his neck.

Why not?

731

about being arrested.

00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,307
Get a license!

980
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,366
Come back when you
got a damn license!

981
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,503
May it
please the court...

982
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,878
for the record, my name
is Leo F. Drummond

983
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,714
of Tinley-Brit,

984
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,185
counsel
for Great Benefit,

985
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,687
and I say

986
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,247
if this young man
has passed the bar exam,

987
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,022
Your Honor, let him
argue the case.

988
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:22,122
We welcome him to, uh,
big-time litigation.

989
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,793
You have no objection,
Mr. Drummond?

990
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,836
Drummond:
lf it please the court,

991
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,532
I would be honored
to introduce Mr. Baylor

992
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,938
to the practice of law

993
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,703
in the great state
of Tennessee.

994
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,540
Judge, you can give him
the oath right now,

995
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,480
and l'll be pleased
to stand for him.

996
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,575
Are you certain you're prepared
to proceed, Mr. Baylor?

00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,450
Abso--[Feedback]

998
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,251
Yeah. Your Honor, yes.

999
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:50,589
Judge Hale: Very well, then.
Raise your right hand.

1000
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,526
Do you solemnly swear,
Rudy Baylor,

1001
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,030
that you will support
the constitution and the laws

1002
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,794

and the state of Tennessee

1003
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,129
faithfully and honorably,

1004
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,193
conduct yourself in the practice
of your profession

1005
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,671
to the best of your skills
and abilities, so help you God?

1006
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,542
I do.

1007
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,046
Ok, fine, fine. That's it.
Let's move on. [Coughs]

1008
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,411
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1009
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,744
Welcome to the war.

1010
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,479
Rudy: Sworn in by a fool
and vouched for by a scoundrel.

1011

Harvey.

1012
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,215
l'm a lawyer at last.

1013
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,722
Judge Hale: Come on in.

1014
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,589
May I, Harv?

1015
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,063
Sure.

1016
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,998
Uh, sit down.

1017
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,528
Um...

1018
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,367
This lawsuit bothers me,
Mr. Baylor.

1019
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,639
I wouldn't use the word
"frivolous,"

1020
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,409
but l'm not impressed
with the merits of it,

1021
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,847
to be frank.

1022
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,909
Drummond: Ahem. l'm gonna try
to sneak some gym time in.

1023
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,285
ln fact, l'm really tired
of these type of lawsuits.

1024
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,880
Don't make no excuses.

1025
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,228
l'm inclined to grant
the motion to dismiss.

1026
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:03,562
Now, you can, uh, refile it
in federal court, you know,

1027
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,262
take it somewhere else.
[Coughs]

1028
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,271
I don't want it
clogging up my docket.

1029
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,637
Now, excuse me
while I go to the can.

1030
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,006
You, too.

1031
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,212
Rudy...

1032
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,752
l'm a very expensive lawyer

1033
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,118
from a very expensive firm,
and, uh...

1034
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,089
l've had a lot of cases.

1035
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,682
I can hit pretty close to
the center of the dart board,

1036
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,729
and I told my clients,
Great Benefit,

1037
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,197
that cost alone here
gonna be a big deal.

1038
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,064
And for you, too.
Your side, too.

1039
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:42,435
Now, they've
authorized me...

1040
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:46,704
to offer you
and your clients...

1041
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,809
$50,000 to settle
this thing out.

1042
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:55,818
And I--I may even be able
to raise that figure up

1043
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:59,879
as high as, uh,
maybe 75,000.

1044
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,084
No admission of liability,
you understand.

1045
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,629
Course, uh...

1046
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,062
if you say no,

1047
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:11,226
then it's going
to be World War lll.

1048
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,359
[Chuckles]

1049
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,904
My turn now.
May I, Harv?

1050
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,668
Sure.

1051
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,074
Uh...

1052
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,537
[Door Closes]

1053
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,878
There's not much
of a lawsuit here,

1054
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,416
l'm afraid, son.

1055
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,749
But maybe I could
lean on Leo

1056
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,051
to make you an offer
of a settlement.

1057
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,023
They'll probably want
to throw some money at you

1058
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,526
to keep from paying Leo
a thousand bucks a minute.

1059
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,027
[Coughing]

1060
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:43,396
But he already offered me
the cost of the defense.

1061
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,368
Oh, really?
How much?

1062
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:49,132
Uh, 75,000.

1063
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,902
Jeez.

1064
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,068
Well, looky here, son,

1065
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,045
you'd be crazy
not to take that.

1066
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,914
You think so?

1067
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,577
75,000? Jeez.

1068
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,848
That's a...
That's a bunch of money.

1069
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,321
Doesn't sound like Leo.

1070
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,950
Well, he's a--
He's a great guy.

1071
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,617
Hmm.

1072
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,924
Whoo.

1073
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,301
So?

1074
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,767
That was not a meeting
in chambers.

1075
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,304
That was an ambush.

1076
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,269
What happened?

1077
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,704
They tag-teamed me.

1078
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,798
Yeah.

1079
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,775
Think they would have
done that to Bruiser?

1080
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,311
Nah. Bruiser's
too savvy for that.

1081
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,276
So what?

1082
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,973
They offered me
75,000.

1083
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,481
Good. Take it.

1084
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,847
Our third is 25,000.

1085
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,317
We need the money.

1086
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,320
Judge Hale is serious
about dismissing this case.

1087
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,787
He's an just
an old angry man

1088
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,290
who's been sitting
on that bench too long.

1089
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,758
The best thing we can do
is grab what we can

00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,454
to make things easy
on his parents.

1091
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,131
The insurance company
made an offer to settle.

1092
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,326
What kind of offer?

1093
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,801
$75,000.

that's what it's gonna cost

1095
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,075
to pay their lawyers
to defend the case.

Dot: Oh.

1097
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,538
Son of a bitches think
they can just buy us off.

1098
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,707
That's exactly
what they think.

1099
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,385
You better talk to him.

1100
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,727
Do you wanna settle,
Rudy?

1101
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,397
I mean, some of the money
is yours.

1102
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,633
No way.

1103
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,405
I wanna expose
these people.

a glass of water, please?

of this case,

I can't help thinking

1110

that while we're all out there
scrambling around for an edge

1111

like we're never gonna die,

looking right at it,

and he's doing it
almost alone.

to imagine the courage
it must take.

You know what
a rainmaker is kid?

What's the problem?

Well, Your Honor, uh...

been ruled upon

Let me ask you something,
Mr. Drummond.

1162

Sure.

your arm?

Yep.

1317
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,070
Why?

Well, l'm a lawyer,

You his mom?

a leisurely dinner,

they'll meet
in some board room

in the order in which I see fit,

so l'd like to start
with Jackie Lemancyzk.

1379

go call the judge.

for our client, and, uh,

1621
01:14:37,785 --> 01:14:39,685
[Whispering]
Bingo.

1622
01:14:39,754 --> 01:14:42,348
We need to know now.

1623
01:14:42,423 --> 01:14:45,017
Let me ask it another way.

1624
01:14:47,195 --> 01:14:49,459
Did any of you have
a conversation recently

1625
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:52,624
with either
Mr. Rudy Baylor

1626
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,328
or directly behind him,
Mr. Deck Schifflet.

1627
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:56,370
Objection, Your Honor!

1628
01:14:56,437 --> 01:14:57,665
This is an outrage!

1629
01:14:57,739 --> 01:14:59,331
What are you doing,
Mr. Drummond?

1630
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:00,738
Drummond: Your Honor,

1631
01:15:00,808 --> 01:15:02,435
we have reason to believe

1632
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:04,341
that this panel
has been tampered with.

1633
01:15:04,412 --> 01:15:05,640
And he's
accusing me.

1634
01:15:05,713 --> 01:15:09,012
I don't understand what
you're doing, Mr. Drummond.

1635
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,015
Well, neither do I,
Your Honor.

1636
01:15:10,084 --> 01:15:11,016
Neither do I.

1637
01:15:11,085 --> 01:15:13,144
Approach the bench, please.

1638
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:19,017
Your Honor, this panel's
been tampered with.

1639
01:15:19,093 --> 01:15:20,185
I want proof, Leo.

1640
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:23,059
I can't say
without divulging

1641
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:24,792
confidential information,
Your Honor.

1642
01:15:24,866 --> 01:15:25,890
You are just
out of your mind.

1643
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:27,525
You are acting
rather bizarrely.

1644
01:15:27,602 --> 01:15:28,864
l'm gonna prove it.

1645
01:15:28,936 --> 01:15:30,426
Kipler: How?

1646
01:15:30,505 --> 01:15:32,530
Deck: Accuse us
of something like that.

1647
01:15:32,607 --> 01:15:33,904
Tamper. I--

1648
01:15:33,975 --> 01:15:35,499
lt's ridiculous.

1649
01:15:35,576 --> 01:15:37,544
Just allow me to finish
questioning the panel.

1650
01:15:37,612 --> 01:15:39,204
I think the truth
will come forth.

1651
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,805
Kipler: Any objection,
Mr. Baylor?

1652
01:15:41,883 --> 01:15:43,009
No, no objection.

1653
01:15:43,084 --> 01:15:45,848
Very well. Proceed.

1654
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,012
Right.

1655
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:52,951
What in the Sam Hill
is going on up there?

1656
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:54,722
Oh, it's just
lawyer stuff.

1657
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:56,824
Drummond: Mr. Porter.

1658
01:15:56,898 --> 01:16:01,494
I want to ask you
a direct question.

1659
01:16:01,569 --> 01:16:03,036
And l'd appreciate

1660
01:16:03,104 --> 01:16:06,403
an honest response.

1661
01:16:06,474 --> 01:16:08,738
You ask an honest
question,

1662
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,402
l'll give you
an honest answer.

1663
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:12,639
Fair enough.

1664
01:16:12,714 --> 01:16:14,773
Did you, Mr. Porter,
or did you not

1665
01:16:14,849 --> 01:16:17,010
have a phone conversation
a few days ago

1666
01:16:17,085 --> 01:16:18,450
with Mr. Rudy Baylor?

1667
01:16:18,519 --> 01:16:19,645
Hell, no.

1668
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:22,053
Drummond: I thought
you were gonna give me

1669
01:16:22,123 --> 01:16:23,181
an honest answer.

1670
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:25,487
I gave you an honest answer.

1671
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,653
Are you sure,
Mr. Porter?

1672
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:29,390
l'm damn sure.

1673
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:30,658
Mr. Porter,

1674
01:16:30,732 --> 01:16:32,097
in a courthouse.

1675
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:33,861
ln a courthouse
in the United States,

1676
01:16:33,935 --> 01:16:36,199
in a courthouse of justice,
state of Tennessee,

1677
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:38,295
I say you did not provide
an honest answer!

1678
01:16:38,373 --> 01:16:39,704
Don't call me a liar.

1679
01:16:39,774 --> 01:16:40,741
Mr. Drummond.

1680
01:16:40,808 --> 01:16:43,402
You son of a bitch.

1681
01:16:45,146 --> 01:16:46,670
Hey, get off him!

1682
01:16:46,748 --> 01:16:47,942
Judge Kipler:
Order in the court!

1683
01:16:50,017 --> 01:16:51,484
Bailiff,

1684
01:16:51,552 --> 01:16:53,417
remove Mr. Porter
from this courtroom.

1685
01:16:53,488 --> 01:16:56,651
Mr. Billy Porter,
you are excused from the jury.

1686
01:17:00,428 --> 01:17:01,520
Drummond: Your Honor,

1687
01:17:01,596 --> 01:17:05,123
I move to dismiss the entire
panel, Your Honor.

1688
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,633
Denied.

1689
01:17:07,702 --> 01:17:09,033
lt's been tainted.

1690
01:17:15,777 --> 01:17:18,007
You, uh...

1691
01:17:19,147 --> 01:17:21,945
Your shoe,
you left it--

1692
01:17:24,886 --> 01:17:26,444
Judge Kipler: Are we ready
to proceed now

1693
01:17:26,521 --> 01:17:29,490
with the jury selection,
Mr. Drummond?

1694
01:17:29,557 --> 01:17:32,993
Drummond: l'm ready
to proceed, Your Honor.

1695
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,358
Kipler: Thank you.

1696
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:00,354
We'll file it today.

1697
01:18:00,421 --> 01:18:01,513
He'll go crazy.

1698
01:18:01,589 --> 01:18:02,578
He already is crazy.

1699
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:05,592
He'll come after you.

1700
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,888
I hope he does.

1701
01:18:06,961 --> 01:18:09,691
This is that good
processed turkey.

1702
01:18:09,764 --> 01:18:11,322
- Oh.
- Oh.

1703
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:13,799
Well, I gotta get
back to court.

1704
01:18:13,868 --> 01:18:15,893
l'm late. I gotta
get back to court.

1705
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,528
What about
your sandwich?

1706
01:18:17,605 --> 01:18:20,233
Oh, I was gonna
take that with me.

1707
01:18:20,308 --> 01:18:22,708
Good, good.

1708
01:18:22,777 --> 01:18:24,108
l'll see you
later.

1709
01:18:24,178 --> 01:18:25,873
Ok?

1710
01:18:34,655 --> 01:18:36,213
How'd it go?

1711
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,190
I served the papers
on Cliff

1712
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:39,783
when he was
on his way to lunch.

1713
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:41,419
He didn't take it
too well,

1714
01:18:41,496 --> 01:18:43,293
but I said I was
ready to rumble.

1715
01:18:43,364 --> 01:18:44,388
He backed down.

1716
01:18:44,465 --> 01:18:47,559
Hey, man, you better
watch your back.

1717
01:18:49,604 --> 01:18:50,969
All right.

1718
01:18:51,038 --> 01:18:54,235
Thanks a lot, Butch.
I appreciate it.

Do you solemnly swear

1720
01:18:55,676 --> 01:18:58,076

about to give in this cause

1721
01:18:58,145 --> 01:18:59,169
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

1722
01:18:59,247 --> 01:19:01,147
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God.

1723
01:19:01,215 --> 01:19:02,182
Yes, I do.

1724
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:05,014
You may take
the stand.

Please state your name
for the record.

Kipler: Sustained.

1739
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:47,222
Mrs. Black, did you purchase
this medical policy

1740
01:19:47,295 --> 01:19:49,456
because you were concerned about
medical care for your son?

1741
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:50,462
Objection.

1742
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:51,896

why don't you
show the policy

1746
01:19:57,405 --> 01:19:59,066
and ask her
why she bought it?

1747

Rudy: Ok.

1748
01:20:02,376 --> 01:20:04,901
Mr. Baylor.

1749
01:20:04,979 --> 01:20:07,812
You must ask
to approach the witness.

1750
01:20:07,882 --> 01:20:11,978
Rudy: Sorry,

Dear Mrs. Black,

On 7 prior occasions

this company has denied

We now deny it

Please remove that exhibit.

Ahem.

Turn it off.

1775
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:34,326
Mrs. Black, why did you sue
Great Benefit for $10 million?

1776
01:21:34,402 --> 01:21:36,461
ls that all?

1777
01:21:37,972 --> 01:21:39,530
I beg your pardon.

1778
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:42,132
I thought it was
more than that.

1779
01:21:42,209 --> 01:21:43,938
ls that so?

1780
01:21:44,011 --> 01:21:46,275
Yes. Your client has
about a billion dollars,

1781
01:21:46,347 --> 01:21:48,212
and your client
killed my son.

1782
01:21:48,282 --> 01:21:51,877
I wanted to sue
for a whole lot more.

1783
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,648
What would you do
with the money?

1784
01:21:55,723 --> 01:21:57,623
lf this jury awards you
$10 million,

1785
01:21:57,692 --> 01:21:59,125
what you gonna do
with the money?

1786
01:21:59,193 --> 01:22:00,125
l'm gonna give it

1787
01:22:00,194 --> 01:22:03,061
to the American
Leukemia Society.

1788
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:04,757
Every cent.

1789
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,527
I don't want a dime
of your stinking money.

1790
01:22:09,603 --> 01:22:13,630
Drummond: Realize you are
under oath, Mrs. Black.

1791
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,869
Approach the witness,
Your Honor?

1792
01:22:15,943 --> 01:22:17,205
Kipler: You may.

1793
01:22:17,278 --> 01:22:18,245
Drummond: Mrs. Black,

1794
01:22:18,312 --> 01:22:20,246
I want you to read
from the policy.

1795
01:22:20,314 --> 01:22:24,580
Page 16, section "K,"
paragraph 14, item "E,"

1796
01:22:24,652 --> 01:22:25,949
in which
the insurance company

1797
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,578
has in plain
English wording said

1798
01:22:27,655 --> 01:22:30,954
that it will not pay for
experimental procedures.

1799
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:33,755
Now, your lawsuit says

1800
01:22:33,828 --> 01:22:36,092
that your son would have
been saved if he had had

1801
01:22:36,163 --> 01:22:37,494
a bone marrow
transplant.

1802
01:22:37,565 --> 01:22:39,556
lsn't it a fact,
Mrs. Black,

1803
01:22:39,633 --> 01:22:41,032
that there are
only 7,000

1804
01:22:41,102 --> 01:22:43,195
bone marrow transplants
performed a year

1805
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:44,601
in the United States?

1806
01:22:44,672 --> 01:22:46,264
Less than 200 in
the state of Tennessee?

1807
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,500
Objection,
Your Honor.

1808
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:48,769
He's leading
the witness.

1809
01:22:48,843 --> 01:22:51,277
This is cross-examination.
Leading is allowed.

1810
01:22:51,345 --> 01:22:53,142
Overruled,

1811
01:22:53,214 --> 01:22:55,114
as to leading.

1812
01:22:55,182 --> 01:22:59,619
Drummond: So it was not
covered by the policy.

1813
01:22:59,687 --> 01:23:00,676
Now, Mrs. Black,

1814
01:23:00,755 --> 01:23:03,485
who was it, uh...

1815
01:23:03,557 --> 01:23:06,458
who was it first diagnosed
your son's condition?

1816
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:10,029
Well, at the very
beginning,

1817
01:23:10,097 --> 01:23:13,555
our doctor,
Dr. Page.

1818
01:23:13,634 --> 01:23:16,000
Drummond: That would be
your family physician?

1819
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:17,697
Yes, sir, it would.

1820
01:23:17,772 --> 01:23:19,171
ls he a good doctor?

1821
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,935
He's a very good doctor.

1822
01:23:21,008 --> 01:23:23,499
And is it not true,
Mrs. Black,

1823
01:23:23,577 --> 01:23:25,010
that this capable,
truthful man

1824
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:28,981
told you repeatedly
that a bone marrow transplant

1825
01:23:29,049 --> 01:23:30,073
would do your son no good

1826
01:23:30,151 --> 01:23:32,915
because of the type
of leukemia he had?

1827
01:23:34,488 --> 01:23:36,285
Well, no.

1828
01:23:36,357 --> 01:23:37,654
No, he did not.

1829
01:23:37,725 --> 01:23:38,692
He didn't say that.

1830
01:23:38,759 --> 01:23:41,319
Not like that,
to me.

1831
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:43,990
Drummond: Approach
the witness, Your Honor?

1832
01:23:44,064 --> 01:23:45,463
Kipler: You may.

1833
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:51,233
Mrs. Black, is this not
Dr. Page's letterhead?

1834
01:23:51,305 --> 01:23:54,297
And at the bottom there,
is that not his signature?

1835
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:56,138
[Whispering]
He can't do that.

1836
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:57,609
Why?

1837
01:23:57,678 --> 01:23:58,667
Because he can't
introduce evidence

1838
01:23:58,746 --> 01:24:00,976
that way.
Plus it's hearsay.

1839
01:24:01,048 --> 01:24:02,879
Objection, Your Honor.

1840
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:06,852
A--A letter from--from
the Blacks' family physician

1841
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:08,980
to Mr. Drummond
is inadmissible.

1842
01:24:09,056 --> 01:24:10,956
Drummond: That is quite
correct, Your Honor.

1843
01:24:11,025 --> 01:24:12,856
And l'm not asking
for this letter

1844
01:24:12,927 --> 01:24:14,326
to be admitted
into evidence.

1845
01:24:14,395 --> 01:24:17,023
l'm simply asking
that this witness

1846
01:24:17,097 --> 01:24:18,155
be allowed
to read the letter

1847
01:24:18,232 --> 01:24:19,961
under rule 612
of the Tennessee

1848
01:24:20,034 --> 01:24:21,296
rules of evidence.

1849
01:24:21,368 --> 01:24:23,165
So her recollection
can be refreshed.

1850
01:24:23,237 --> 01:24:25,671
Kipler: Mr. Baylor,
what do you say?

1851
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:27,297
I don't know, Your Honor.

1852
01:24:27,374 --> 01:24:28,500
I just object to this.

1853
01:24:28,576 --> 01:24:32,342
And also we were not
furnished this letter

1854
01:24:32,413 --> 01:24:33,812
in pre-trial discovery.

1855
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:36,349
What do you say
to that, Mr. Drummond?

1856
01:24:36,417 --> 01:24:38,146
I had no idea this
letter would be needed.

1857
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:39,914
I expected this lady
to tell the truth

1858
01:24:39,987 --> 01:24:41,420
about what her doctor
told her.

1859
01:24:43,624 --> 01:24:45,717
Anything else, Mr. Baylor?

1860
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:49,329
No.

1861
01:24:51,465 --> 01:24:52,625
Kipler: Mr. Drummond,

1862
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:55,362
l'm gonna give you
a little latitude,

1863
01:24:55,436 --> 01:24:57,063
but don't stray too far.

1864
01:24:57,137 --> 01:24:59,697
Very well, Your Honor.
Now, Mrs. Black,

1865
01:24:59,773 --> 01:25:02,333
does that letter refresh
your recollection

1866
01:25:02,409 --> 01:25:04,639
as to whether or not
Donny Ray's leukemia

1867
01:25:04,712 --> 01:25:06,009
was the kind
that could be helped

1868
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,240
with a bone marrow
transplant?

1869
01:25:07,314 --> 01:25:09,612
Well, see, now,
he is not a specialist.

1870
01:25:09,683 --> 01:25:10,615
But he is a licensed,

1871
01:25:10,684 --> 01:25:13,949
experienced,
capable physician

1872
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:16,751
who lovingly told you
time and time again

1873
01:25:16,824 --> 01:25:20,021
what you quite understandably
did not want to accept:

1874
01:25:20,094 --> 01:25:22,927
That your son
was going to die of leukemia

1875
01:25:22,997 --> 01:25:25,795
despite the best efforts
of medical science.

1876
01:25:25,866 --> 01:25:27,231
ls that not true?

1877
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:29,861
Mrs. Black: But he wasn't
a specialist.

1878
01:25:29,937 --> 01:25:31,336
I didn't believe him.

1879
01:25:31,405 --> 01:25:34,238
Drummond: Not only did you
not believe him, ma'am,

1880
01:25:34,308 --> 01:25:36,173
but you were less than
truthful with me

1881
01:25:36,243 --> 01:25:37,904
and with this jury
moments ago

1882
01:25:37,978 --> 01:25:39,809
when you told us under oath

1883
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,644
that Dr. Page never said
that your son

1884
01:25:42,716 --> 01:25:45,150
had the type of leukemia
that could not be treated

1885
01:25:45,219 --> 01:25:46,618
by a bone marrow transplant.

1886
01:25:46,687 --> 01:25:48,746
I believe
your exact words were,

1887
01:25:48,822 --> 01:25:50,983
"He never said that.

1888
01:25:51,058 --> 01:25:52,184
Not like that

1889
01:25:52,259 --> 01:25:54,022
to me."

1890
01:25:54,094 --> 01:25:56,995
He wasn't a specialist.

1891
01:25:57,064 --> 01:25:59,362
I just wanted Donny Ray

1892
01:25:59,433 --> 01:26:04,598
to have the best medical
treatment available.

1893
01:26:04,672 --> 01:26:07,197
You'd do the same thing.

1894
01:26:07,274 --> 01:26:09,333
Drummond:
Of course, ma'am.

1895
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:12,106
Of course.

1896
01:26:12,179 --> 01:26:13,737
That'll be all.

1897
01:26:16,116 --> 01:26:18,311
You may step down,
Mrs. Black.

1898
01:26:25,926 --> 01:26:28,360
I didn't do very good,
did I?

1899
01:26:28,429 --> 01:26:30,021
Oh, no, no,
you did fine.

1900
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:31,189
You did fine.

1901
01:26:31,265 --> 01:26:33,324
lt's all right.
The jury can see

1902
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,958
exactly what
he's up to.

1903
01:26:35,035 --> 01:26:36,434
The jury can see
what he's up to.

1904
01:26:36,503 --> 01:26:37,470
I need a smoke.

This is Jackie Lemancyzk.

2106

Where she goes,

This is my partner,

2108
01:37:56,282 --> 01:37:58,045
Rudy S. Baylor.

2109

what you told me.

2110

lt's a pleasure
to meet you.

2112

if I sit down?

2113
01:38:06,493 --> 01:38:07,687
Sure, sure.

2114
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:10,252
All right,
Miss Lemancyzk,

2115
01:38:10,330 --> 01:38:12,924
let's talk
about the Black file.

2116
01:38:12,999 --> 01:38:14,626
lt was assigned to you?

2117
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:16,760
Yes, that's correct.

2118
01:38:16,836 --> 01:38:19,066
The initial claim
from Mrs. Black

2119
01:38:19,139 --> 01:38:20,163
was assigned to me.

2120
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:21,798
Pursuant to company
policy at the time,

2121
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:24,639
I sent her
a letter of denial.

2122
01:38:24,711 --> 01:38:25,700
Why?

2123
01:38:25,779 --> 01:38:27,713
Why?

2124
01:38:29,449 --> 01:38:31,713
Because all claims
were initially denied.

2125
01:38:35,388 --> 01:38:36,878
All claims?

2126
01:38:36,956 --> 01:38:39,447
All claims.

2127
01:38:44,931 --> 01:38:47,957
Ok, this is how it works.

2128
01:38:48,034 --> 01:38:50,229
The policy...

2129
01:38:50,303 --> 01:38:51,998
is sold door to door

2130
01:38:52,072 --> 01:38:53,505
in the poorer
neighborhoods.

2131
01:38:53,573 --> 01:38:55,165
Paid in cash

2132
01:38:55,241 --> 01:38:57,766
each week.

2133
01:38:57,844 --> 01:39:02,747
The claim comes in
and is assigned to a handler.

2134
01:39:02,816 --> 01:39:07,082
That's basically
a low level paper pusher.

2135
01:39:07,153 --> 01:39:11,817
Anyway, the handler
reviews it

2136
01:39:11,891 --> 01:39:14,655
and immediately sends
a letter to the insured

2137
01:39:14,728 --> 01:39:15,820
denying the clam.

2138
01:39:15,895 --> 01:39:17,624
The claims handler

2139
01:39:17,697 --> 01:39:20,632
then sends the file
over to underwriting.

2140
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,134
Underwriting sends a memo
back to claims

2141
01:39:23,203 --> 01:39:26,195
saying, "Don't pay this
until you hear from us."

2142
01:39:26,272 --> 01:39:28,797
Now, what you should
keep in mind

2143
01:39:28,875 --> 01:39:30,308
is that even though
all these people work

2144
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:31,343
for this big company,

2145
01:39:31,411 --> 01:39:33,003
and they all work
in the same building,

2146
01:39:33,079 --> 01:39:34,569
they don't know each other.

2147
01:39:34,647 --> 01:39:37,172
Nor do they know what the other
department is up to.

2148
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,342
Now, this is very intentional.

2149
01:39:38,418 --> 01:39:40,613
The departments are kept
at war with each other.

2150
01:39:40,687 --> 01:39:42,780
Now, meanwhile,

2151
01:39:42,856 --> 01:39:45,723
there's the client.

2152
01:39:47,093 --> 01:39:50,062
And they're getting
all these letters.

2153
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:54,123
Some from claims,
some from underwriting,

2154
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,135
and most people give up.

2155
01:39:58,805 --> 01:40:02,502
And this, of course,
is...

2156
01:40:02,575 --> 01:40:04,304
intended.

2157

she was lost.

she can't testify?

that I no longer
worked there.

Can you please point out
the man in the courtroom

who made you
write this letter?

immediately,

and I had 2 choices--

2209
01:42:23,416 --> 01:42:25,907
I could call it a firing
and leave with nothing,

2210

or I could write
that letter,

call it a resignation,

give me $10,000 in cash

01:44:51,364 --> 01:44:52,422
and may not be admitted.

2267
01:44:52,498 --> 01:44:53,430
May not be admitted?

2268
01:44:53,499 --> 01:44:54,693
Can you prove this, Leo?

2269
01:44:54,767 --> 01:44:57,099
Your Honor, I ask that you
instruct my colleague here

2270
01:44:57,170 --> 01:44:58,159
not to read from

2271
01:44:58,237 --> 01:45:00,467
nor to make reference
to any suspect--

2272
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:04,067
I don't understand
why this is not admissible.

2273
01:45:04,143 --> 01:45:05,770
lt was not proffered
at the correct time,

2274
01:45:05,845 --> 01:45:06,971
nor do we know
how it was obtained--

2275
01:45:07,046 --> 01:45:08,877
I just found out
about this last night.

2276
01:45:08,948 --> 01:45:10,848
Assuming that I can't
get this in now,

2277
01:45:10,917 --> 01:45:12,646
do you have any more
questions for the witness?

2278
01:45:13,553 --> 01:45:14,520
No, Your Honor.

2279
01:45:14,587 --> 01:45:17,317
You may cross-examine,
Mr. Drummond.

2280
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:18,948
Thank you.

2281
01:45:32,939 --> 01:45:35,203
ls it true,
Miss Lemancyzk...

2282
01:45:36,476 --> 01:45:39,104
that you have recently
been committed

2283
01:45:39,178 --> 01:45:41,112
to an institution
for various problems?

2284
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:43,307
I was not committed.

2285
01:45:43,382 --> 01:45:46,545
I am suffering from
alcoholism and depression,

2286
01:45:46,619 --> 01:45:50,055
and I voluntarily
checked into a facility.

2287
01:45:50,123 --> 01:45:51,954
I was supposed
to be covered

2288
01:45:52,024 --> 01:45:54,219
by my group policy
at Great Benefit,

2289
01:45:54,293 --> 01:45:56,727
and they, of course,
are denying my claim.

2290
01:45:56,796 --> 01:45:58,661
ls that why you're here,
Miss Lemancyzk?

2291
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:01,097
Because you're angry
with Great Benefit?

2292
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:02,134
Miss Lemancyzk?

2293
01:46:02,201 --> 01:46:04,795
I hate Great Benefit

2294
01:46:04,871 --> 01:46:07,635
and most of the worms
that work there.

2295
01:46:07,707 --> 01:46:09,937
Did you feel
Mr. Lufkin was a worm

2296
01:46:10,009 --> 01:46:11,567
when you were
sleeping with him?

2297
01:46:12,612 --> 01:46:14,705
Objection.

2298
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:15,974
Your Honor,

2299
01:46:16,048 --> 01:46:18,312
Mr. Drummond might find this
fun to talk about,

2300
01:46:18,384 --> 01:46:20,579
but this is
not relevant at all.

2301
01:46:20,653 --> 01:46:22,518
Oh, there's
no fun for me.

2302
01:46:22,588 --> 01:46:23,987
Overruled.

2303
01:46:24,056 --> 01:46:25,284
Let's see
where this takes us.

2304
01:46:25,358 --> 01:46:29,852
Drummond: You admit to having
an affair with Mr. Lufkin?

2305
01:46:35,935 --> 01:46:38,563
Miss Lemancyzk?

2306
01:46:43,509 --> 01:46:48,105
As long as I had sex
with certain executives

2307
01:46:48,181 --> 01:46:50,649
at Great Benefit,

2308
01:46:50,716 --> 01:46:55,050
my pay was increased,
and I was promoted.

2309
01:46:55,121 --> 01:46:58,022
Lemancyzk: When I stopped,
I was demoted.

2310
01:46:58,090 --> 01:46:59,580
Drummond:
Miss Lemancyzk,

2311
01:46:59,659 --> 01:47:01,490
as an employee
of Great Benefit,

2312
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:03,392
you promised
not to disclose

2313
01:47:03,462 --> 01:47:05,794
confidential private
claims information.

2314
01:47:05,865 --> 01:47:07,298
- Yes?
- Yes.

2315
01:47:07,366 --> 01:47:08,731
ln fact, you testified

2316
01:47:08,801 --> 01:47:11,565
that you sealed
that promise

2317
01:47:11,637 --> 01:47:14,629
by demand of payment
for $10,000, didn't you?

2318
01:47:14,707 --> 01:47:16,607
That payment
was not my idea.

2319
01:47:16,676 --> 01:47:18,200
But you accepted it,
didn't you?

2320
01:47:18,277 --> 01:47:20,211
You put it right
in your pocketbook.

2321
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:21,507
Even though
in your mind,

2322
01:47:21,581 --> 01:47:23,674
you never intended
to keep that promise.

2323
01:47:23,749 --> 01:47:26,309
ln fact,
you were very angry

2324
01:47:26,385 --> 01:47:28,819
at Great Benefit and
Mr. Lufkin, weren't you?

2325
01:47:28,888 --> 01:47:30,822
You know,
they preyed on me,

2326
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:33,085
because I was broke,
and I was single,

2327
01:47:33,159 --> 01:47:34,558
and I had 2 kids.

2328
01:47:34,627 --> 01:47:36,322
So you told him you're
gonna go to his wife,

2329
01:47:36,395 --> 01:47:37,327
go to the newspapers.

2330
01:47:37,396 --> 01:47:38,454
And that $10,000,

2331
01:47:38,531 --> 01:47:40,692
that was just a piece
of blackmail, wasn't it?

2332
01:47:40,766 --> 01:47:43,997
A way to extort money
from the company you hated!

2333
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:45,196
lsn't that right?

2334
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:46,499
No, that's not true.

2335
01:47:46,572 --> 01:47:48,733
ln fact, your testimony
here today is just a lie.

2336
01:47:48,808 --> 01:47:50,400
You stole
company work papers,

2337
01:47:50,476 --> 01:47:53,741
confidential reports
as blackmail for revenge.

2338
01:47:53,813 --> 01:47:58,216
Hell hath no fury
as what, Miss Lemancyzk?

2339
01:47:58,284 --> 01:48:01,412
A woman scorned!

2340
01:48:01,487 --> 01:48:04,456
Your Honor, I move
that all documents

2341
01:48:04,523 --> 01:48:07,686
provided the plaintiff
by Miss Jackie Lemancyzk

2342
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,625
be deemed
stolen work papers

2343
01:48:09,695 --> 01:48:11,458
and struck
from these proceedings.

2344
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:24,108
Based on the evidence
presently before the court,

2345
01:48:24,176 --> 01:48:25,871
these documents
are inadmissible.

2346
01:48:25,945 --> 01:48:27,003
Ohh.

2347
01:48:30,883 --> 01:48:32,407
No further questions.

2348
01:48:32,485 --> 01:48:34,077
Kipler:
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

2349
01:48:34,153 --> 01:48:35,814
Mr. Baylor.

2350
01:48:38,224 --> 01:48:40,317
You may step down,
Miss Lemancyzk.

2351
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:49,595
l'm sorry.

2352
01:49:04,517 --> 01:49:05,779
Man: Hello.

2353
01:49:05,851 --> 01:49:07,546
Hi. This is Deck Schifflet.

2354
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:09,611
I need to speak to Big Rhino.
Can you connect me?

2355
01:49:09,689 --> 01:49:11,850
Big Rhino?
Just a second.

2356
01:49:11,924 --> 01:49:13,016
Ok.

2357
01:49:17,997 --> 01:49:19,055
Hello?

2358
01:49:19,131 --> 01:49:20,598
Hey, boss, it's Deck.

2359
01:49:20,666 --> 01:49:22,133
Oh, hey, Deck,
how you doing?

2360
01:49:22,201 --> 01:49:23,293
Good. How are you?

2361
01:49:23,369 --> 01:49:24,427
Well, l'm cool.

2362
01:49:24,503 --> 01:49:26,232
Are you here?

2363
01:49:26,305 --> 01:49:27,772
Well,
l'm here and there.

2364
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,933
Ah, yeah,
here and there.

2365
01:49:30,009 --> 01:49:34,173
Listen, I got
a stolen-evidence situation.

2366
01:49:34,246 --> 01:49:37,374
Ok. Stolen evidence,
uh...

2367
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:39,179
Let me see, uh...

2368
01:49:39,251 --> 01:49:41,685
Ok. The De Soto case.

2369
01:49:41,754 --> 01:49:42,721
De Soto?

2370
01:49:42,788 --> 01:49:46,224
Carmine De Soto.
You remember him?

2371
01:49:46,292 --> 01:49:47,190
Club Ruby.

2372
01:49:47,259 --> 01:49:48,624
Uh-huh.

2373
01:49:48,694 --> 01:49:50,628
Where--Where do I find that?

2374
01:49:50,696 --> 01:49:54,132
Uh, around '92,
you'll find it, uh,

2375
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,600
let's see,
650 something, uh...

2376
01:49:56,669 --> 01:49:58,034
Southwest Second.

2377
01:49:58,104 --> 01:49:59,503
Boss, you're a lifesaver.

2378
01:49:59,572 --> 01:50:00,504
'92?

2379
01:50:00,573 --> 01:50:02,200
Yeah. Club Ruby case.

2380
01:50:02,274 --> 01:50:04,105
'92...

2381
01:50:04,176 --> 01:50:05,200
Carmine De Soto.

2382
01:50:05,277 --> 01:50:06,335
Carmine De Soto.

2383
01:50:06,412 --> 01:50:07,344
Club Ruby.

2384
01:50:07,413 --> 01:50:08,311
Club Ruby.

2385
01:50:08,381 --> 01:50:09,643
lt's from
the appellate court.

2386
01:50:09,715 --> 01:50:11,615
Yeah.
lt kind of rings a bell.

2387
01:50:16,021 --> 01:50:16,988
I got it!

2388
01:50:17,056 --> 01:50:19,115
And from Bruiser,
of all people.

2389
01:50:19,191 --> 01:50:21,125
Bruiser? I thought you didn't
know where Bruiser was.

2390
01:50:21,193 --> 01:50:24,162
Well, I don't, but I got
an emergency-contact number.

2391
01:50:24,230 --> 01:50:26,391
I call them, they get me
in touch with him.

2392
01:50:26,465 --> 01:50:27,659
Look, Rudy,

2393
01:50:27,733 --> 01:50:29,963
nobody knows more than Bruiser
about stolen evidence.

2394
01:50:30,035 --> 01:50:31,969
You might say
it's his stock and trade.

2395
01:50:32,037 --> 01:50:33,129
- [Ring]
- Hello?

2396
01:50:33,205 --> 01:50:34,502
Woman: Mr. Rudy Baylor?

2397
01:50:34,573 --> 01:50:35,471
Yes.

2398
01:50:35,541 --> 01:50:37,236
This is
the Shelby County D.A.

2399
01:50:37,309 --> 01:50:38,742
Can you come
to the courthouse tonight?

2400
01:50:38,811 --> 01:50:40,904
l'd like to discuss
the Kelly Riker case.

2401
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:41,912
Sure.

2402
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:43,414
Come to room 6.

2403
01:50:45,217 --> 01:50:47,879
There's an advantage to dealing
with pimps and thieves.

2404
01:50:47,953 --> 01:50:50,922
ln the case of Carmine De Soto
vs. the Club Ruby,

2405
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:52,924
there are reams
of stolen evidence.

2406
01:50:52,992 --> 01:50:54,983
Now, Bruiser worked
on this stuff himself.

2407
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:57,528
Not now.
I got to go.

2408
01:50:57,596 --> 01:50:58,824
You got to go?

2409
01:50:58,898 --> 01:51:01,332
You got the CEO of Great Benefit
coming in tomorrow.

2410
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:04,631
We--We got to nail this guy,
come on.

2411
01:51:16,315 --> 01:51:17,805
Good luck, Kelly.

2412
01:51:17,883 --> 01:51:19,350
Thanks.

2413
01:51:23,889 --> 01:51:25,789
I met with the D.A.

2414
01:51:25,858 --> 01:51:27,758
She's not
gonna prosecute.

2415
01:51:27,827 --> 01:51:30,921
Said she'd never
get a conviction.

2416
01:51:30,996 --> 01:51:33,089
lt was self-defense,
Kelly.

2417
01:51:44,643 --> 01:51:46,907
Deck: The plaintiff
would like to call

2418
01:51:46,979 --> 01:51:49,812
Wilfred Keeley
to the stand.

2419
01:51:49,882 --> 01:51:51,509
Clerk: Raise your
right hand, please.

2420
01:51:51,584 --> 01:51:53,484
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

2421
01:51:53,552 --> 01:51:54,712
you're about to give
in this cause

2422
01:51:54,787 --> 01:51:56,152
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

2423
01:51:56,222 --> 01:51:58,122
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

2424
01:51:58,190 --> 01:51:59,122
I do.

2425
01:51:59,191 --> 01:52:00,954
You may take the stand.

2426

Judge Kipler: State your name
for the record.

2427

Wilfred Keeley.

2428
01:52:06,932 --> 01:52:08,797
May I approach
the witness, Your Honor?

2429
01:52:08,868 --> 01:52:10,301
You may.

2430
01:52:10,369 --> 01:52:13,702
Mr. Keeley, uh, in this
Great Benefit brochure,

2431
01:52:13,772 --> 01:52:15,569
is that you?
ls that your name?

2432
01:52:15,641 --> 01:52:16,573
Yes.

2433
01:52:16,642 --> 01:52:18,940
And what do
those initials stand for?

2434
01:52:19,011 --> 01:52:20,410
CEO?

2435
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:23,414
Yeah. What do they stand for?
What does "CEO" mean?

2436
01:52:23,482 --> 01:52:24,915
Chief Executive Officer.

2437
01:52:24,984 --> 01:52:27,214
Chief Executive Officer.
Thank you, thank you.

2438
01:52:27,286 --> 01:52:30,050
So you're the--
you're the guy.

2439
01:52:30,122 --> 01:52:32,920
You're the main guy,
you're the cheese.

2440
01:52:32,992 --> 01:52:34,653
The buck stops with you.

2441
01:52:34,727 --> 01:52:36,126
You could say that, yes.

2442
01:52:36,195 --> 01:52:37,389
Yeah. Ok. Thank you.

2443
01:52:37,463 --> 01:52:40,296
Uh, Your Honor, l'd like
to turn the questioning

2444
01:52:40,366 --> 01:52:45,167
of Mr. Keeley over
to my partner Rudy Baylor.

2445
01:52:45,237 --> 01:52:46,829
[Whispering]
Are you out of your mind?

2446
01:52:46,906 --> 01:52:47,998
You don't have a license.

2447
01:52:48,073 --> 01:52:50,007
I didn't have a choice.
What are you doing?

2448
01:52:50,075 --> 01:52:51,474
You're late.

2449
01:52:51,544 --> 01:52:52,841
Good morning, Your Honor.

2450
01:52:52,912 --> 01:52:54,880
Sorry l'm late, sir.

2451
01:52:54,947 --> 01:52:57,245
Approach the witness,
Your Honor?

2452
01:52:57,316 --> 01:52:59,045
You may.

2453
01:52:59,118 --> 01:53:00,745
This is the claims manual

2454
01:53:00,819 --> 01:53:02,753
that was given to me
by Jackie Lemancyzk.

2455
01:53:02,821 --> 01:53:03,753
Drummond: Objection,
Your Honor.

2456
01:53:03,822 --> 01:53:05,312
Stolen work papers.
lnadmissible.

2457
01:53:05,391 --> 01:53:06,323
You ruled on this.

2458
01:53:06,392 --> 01:53:07,552
Kipler: Sustained.

2459
01:53:07,626 --> 01:53:08,957
May we approach?

2460
01:53:13,332 --> 01:53:15,391
Drummond: I thought this matter
was already settled, Your Honor.

2461
01:53:15,467 --> 01:53:17,401
Rudy: Your Honor,
I just this morning

2462
01:53:17,469 --> 01:53:18,993
found a case
that is controlled

2463
01:53:19,071 --> 01:53:20,402
in this
factual situation.

2464
01:53:20,472 --> 01:53:21,837
Judge Kipler:
What do you have?

2465
01:53:21,907 --> 01:53:24,398
lf you'll just take
a look at this ruling.

2466
01:53:24,476 --> 01:53:27,036
lt's Club Ruby
vs. Carmine De Soto.

2467
01:53:27,112 --> 01:53:29,512
Copy for Your Honor
and one for Mr. Drummond.

2468
01:53:29,582 --> 01:53:32,551
Number 585,
Southwest Second, page 431,

2469
01:53:32,618 --> 01:53:35,382
argued by Bruiser--
by J. Lyman Stone.

2470
01:53:35,454 --> 01:53:36,682
And it shows very clearly

2471
01:53:36,755 --> 01:53:38,780
that stolen documents
are, in fact, admissible

2472
01:53:38,857 --> 01:53:41,553
if the lawyers played
no part in the theft.

2473
01:53:41,627 --> 01:53:44,289
Well, according
to these head notes,

2474
01:53:44,363 --> 01:53:46,957
this case will overrule
your objection.

2475
01:53:47,032 --> 01:53:48,329
Sorry, Leo.

2476
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:51,369
Oh, l'm sure you are,
Your Honor.

2477
01:53:51,437 --> 01:53:53,166
But note
my strong objection.

2478
01:53:53,238 --> 01:53:54,364
Objection noted.

2479
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:56,374
May I approach?

2480
01:53:56,442 --> 01:53:57,704
Do so.

2481
01:53:59,612 --> 01:54:02,103
Uh...Your Honor...

2482
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:04,649
Your Honor, l'm sorry.

2483
01:54:04,717 --> 01:54:07,015
Excuse the interruption,
Mr. Keeley.

2484
01:54:07,086 --> 01:54:08,951
We were about
to talk about

2485
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:11,046
the Great Benefit
Claims Manual.

2486
01:54:11,123 --> 01:54:15,287
ls that a complete Great Benefit
Claims Manual, sir?

2487
01:54:17,162 --> 01:54:18,288
Yes.

2488
01:54:18,364 --> 01:54:20,457
Does it have
a section "U"?

2489
01:54:24,903 --> 01:54:28,532
Keeley: lt has
a section "U" in it.

2490
01:54:28,607 --> 01:54:30,632
Well, let's talk about
this mysterious section "U."

2491
01:54:30,709 --> 01:54:32,677
Why don't we explain it
to the jury?

2492
01:54:32,745 --> 01:54:34,542
Take a look at it.

2493
01:54:35,714 --> 01:54:37,614
Just read paragraph 3.

2494
01:54:41,754 --> 01:54:45,053
"Claim handlers are directed
to deny all claims

2495
01:54:45,124 --> 01:54:47,684
within 3 days
of receipt of claim.

2496
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,022
No exceptions."

2497
01:54:49,094 --> 01:54:51,961
Now, how do you explain
this section "U"?

2498
01:54:52,031 --> 01:54:55,125
Well, sometimes
we get some frivolous

2499
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:58,692
and fraudulent claims
in our business,

2500
01:54:58,771 --> 01:55:01,171
and sometimes we have to use
this kind of language

2501
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:03,504
to focus in on
the legitimate

2502
01:55:03,575 --> 01:55:05,770
and more needy claims.

2503
01:55:07,246 --> 01:55:09,908
Mr. Keeley, do you honestly
expect this court

2504
01:55:09,982 --> 01:55:11,813
to believe that explanation?

2505
01:55:11,884 --> 01:55:13,476
Well, this chapter
merely denotes

2506
01:55:13,552 --> 01:55:16,487
in-house
processing guidelines.

2507
01:55:16,555 --> 01:55:18,022
ln-house
processing guidelines.

2508
01:55:18,090 --> 01:55:20,320
No, Mr. Keeley.
No, it does not.

2509
01:55:20,392 --> 01:55:22,155
Section "U" does
a lot more than that.

2510
01:55:22,227 --> 01:55:23,990
I don't think
it does that, son.

2511
01:55:24,063 --> 01:55:26,327
Mr. Keeley, doesn't it
explain precisely

2512
01:55:26,398 --> 01:55:28,866
how claims should be routed
and shuffled and rerouted,

2513
01:55:28,934 --> 01:55:30,925
anything to avoid payment?

2514
01:55:31,003 --> 01:55:32,061
I admit nothing.

2515
01:55:32,137 --> 01:55:33,502
Your Honor,
approach the witness?

2516
01:55:33,572 --> 01:55:34,869
You may.

2517
01:55:39,111 --> 01:55:41,375
Now, Mr. Keeley,

2518
01:55:41,447 --> 01:55:45,406
how many policies did
Great Benefit have in effect

2519
01:55:45,484 --> 01:55:49,215
in the year 1995?

2520
01:55:52,324 --> 01:55:54,588
I don't know.

2521
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:56,150
Well, let's see.

2522
01:55:58,063 --> 01:56:02,193
Does the figure 98,000 sound
correct, give or take a few?

2523
01:56:03,669 --> 01:56:05,193
Maybe.

2524
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:07,067
That could be right,
yeah.

2525
01:56:07,139 --> 01:56:08,299
Thank you.

2526
01:56:08,373 --> 01:56:11,968
Now, of these policies,
how many claims were filed?

2527
01:56:13,812 --> 01:56:16,576
Well, I don't--
I don't know that.

2528
01:56:16,648 --> 01:56:19,981
Does the figure of 11,400
sound correct to you,

2529
01:56:20,052 --> 01:56:21,679
give or take a few?

2530
01:56:21,754 --> 01:56:23,551
That's about right,

2531
01:56:23,622 --> 01:56:27,422
but l'd have to
verify it, of course.

2532
01:56:27,493 --> 01:56:29,017
I see. So the information
that I want

2533
01:56:29,094 --> 01:56:30,459
is right there in that book?

2534
01:56:30,529 --> 01:56:31,427
Yes.

2535
01:56:31,497 --> 01:56:32,828
Can you tell the jury

2536
01:56:32,898 --> 01:56:35,264
of the 11 some odd thousand
claims filed,

2537
01:56:35,334 --> 01:56:36,767
how many were denied?

2538
01:56:39,304 --> 01:56:42,239
I don't think I could.
That would take more time.

2539
01:56:42,307 --> 01:56:44,366
You've had 2 months,
Mr. Keeley.

2540
01:56:44,443 --> 01:56:46,274
Now answer the question.

2541
01:56:50,349 --> 01:56:52,647
Well, I...

2542
01:56:53,652 --> 01:56:55,415
I don't think...

2543
01:56:57,623 --> 01:56:58,885
Um...

2544
01:57:00,626 --> 01:57:03,254
"9,141."

2545

01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,965

2549
01:57:18,043 --> 01:57:19,977
I have yet another document.

2550
01:57:20,045 --> 01:57:21,307
This is a report

from Great Benefit's
medical committee.

2552

Request permission
under previous precedent

to present it to Mr. Keeley.

Uh, Mr. Keeley,
that is a report

2558
01:57:46,138 --> 01:57:49,232
from Great Benefit's

of $10 million accomplish?

All insurance company premiums
will spin out of reach,

2590

Ladies and gentlemen

2601

of Donny Ray Black...

2602

gasping for his last breath
of air and slowly dying...

with myself...

2605

that could not save him.

2606

I don't even feel good enough
about myself as a lawyer

to make my own summation.

2608
02:00:40,212 --> 02:00:43,773

l'd let Donny Ray do that.

2612

The leukemia was detected
in plenty of time.

2613
02:01:06,204 --> 02:01:08,468
I was in the hospital
being treated

2614
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:09,802
when the doctors realized

2615
02:01:09,875 --> 02:01:11,502
that the only thing
that could save my life

2616
02:01:11,576 --> 02:01:14,204
would be
a bone-marrow transplant.

2617
02:01:15,781 --> 02:01:20,775
So, I got released
from the hospital,

2618

couldn't afford to pay

they had recommended.

a bone-marrow transplant,

a 90% chance of living.

from a low-income family

02:07:52,110 --> 02:07:54,772
Rudy:
So, I guess Kelly and I

2742
02:07:54,846 --> 02:07:58,942
will be taking off
first thing in the morning.

2743
02:07:59,017 --> 02:08:01,042
We made history, Rudy.

2744
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:03,885
You know that?

2745
02:08:06,558 --> 02:08:08,526
We can always brag.

2746
02:08:10,595 --> 02:08:12,028
Bye.

2747
02:08:13,164 --> 02:08:14,893
Rudy: There's no doubt
about it--l'm hot.

2748
02:08:14,966 --> 02:08:17,025
ln fact, l'm so hot
after this case,

2749
02:08:17,101 --> 02:08:19,899
there's no place for me
to go but down.

2750
02:08:19,971 --> 02:08:20,995
See ya.

2751
02:08:21,072 --> 02:08:23,404
Every client I ever have
will expect this--

2752
02:08:23,475 --> 02:08:26,603
The same magic,
nothing less.

2753
02:08:26,678 --> 02:08:29,112
And I could probably
give it to them,

2754
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:31,774
if it didn't matter
how I did it.

2755
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:33,112
And then one morning,

2756
02:08:33,184 --> 02:08:36,984
l'd wake up and find
that l'd become Leo Drummond.

2757
02:08:37,055 --> 02:08:41,515
Now, you give me a call
when you pass the bar exam.

2758
02:08:41,593 --> 02:08:43,823
Yeah, piece of cake!

2759
02:08:46,197 --> 02:08:49,064
Every lawyer,
at least once in every case,

2760
02:08:49,133 --> 02:08:52,330
feels himself crossing a line
he doesn't really mean to cross.

2761
02:08:52,403 --> 02:08:53,461
lt just happens.

2762
02:08:53,538 --> 02:08:55,529
And if you cross it
enough times,

2763
02:08:55,607 --> 02:08:57,575
it disappears forever.

2764
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:01,506
And then you're nothing
but another lawyer joke,

2765
02:09:01,579 --> 02:09:04,605
just another shark
in the dirty water.

2766
02:09:05,579 --> 02:09:05,579
