1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:23,248
Harry Potter and the
Order of the Phoenix

2
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:51,455
It's just too hot today isn't it?

3
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,164
And it's going to get even worse.

4
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,773
temperatures up in the mid 30s Celsius.

5
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,816
And at night should go
up even, and perhaps...

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,460
Alright, lets go home.

7
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,535
What a lovely day.

8
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:15,391
Do we have to? We do.

9
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:30,767
Hey big D. Beat up another 10 year old?

10
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:33,073
This one deserved
it. - Ya. - Ya.

11
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,710
5 against 1, very brave.
Well you're the one to talk?

12
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,237
moaning in your sleep every night.

13
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:42,772
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

14
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:47,533
Don't kill Cedric.

15
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:51,515
Who's Cedric? Your boyfriend? Shut up.

16
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,644
He's going to kill me, mom.

17
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:58,616
Where is your mom?

18
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:01,892
Where is your mom, Potter?

19
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:03,826
Is she dead?

20
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:06,829
Is she dead?!

21
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:08,928
Is she dead...

22
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:24,036
What's going on?

23
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:26,618
What's going on here?

24
00:02:27,118 --> 00:02:28,486
What are you doing?

25
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:30,678
I'm not doing anything.

26
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,853
Dudley, come on!

27
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:18,571
Run!

28
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,609
Dudley, run!

29
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:59,255
Expecto Patronum!

30
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:28,171
Mrs. Figg.

31
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:37,508
Took for the riddle wand,
Harry. They might come back.

32
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:41,791
Dementors in little
Winchik. What's next?

33
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,825
Whole world's in top sterny.

34
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,562
I don't understand. How did you know...

35
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:48,097
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

36
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:51,030
Dumbledore? You know Dumbledore?
- yea.

37
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:54,672
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year.

38
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:58,208
Did you expect him to let
you go wandering around alone?

39
00:04:58,508 --> 00:04:59,944
Good Lord, they told
me you're intelligent.

40
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:03,747
Now, get inside and stay there.

41
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:05,749
Soon someone will be in touch with you.

42
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,150
Whatever happens, don't freak out.

43
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:19,198
It is hot. That's it, too hot.

44
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,020
The heat is suffocating...

45
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,593
Dudley?

46
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:24,610
Is that you?

47
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:29,521
Dudley?

48
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:30,961
Vernon, come quick!

49
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,189
We need to take him to a hospital.

50
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:36,747
Who did that with you, son?

51
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:40,587
Happy, are we now?

52
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:45,594
You finally done it. You
finally driven Dudley.

53
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,480
Vernon, don't you say that.

54
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:49,724
Just look at him, Petunia.

55
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,899
Our boy has gone yumpie.

56
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,201
I've reach my limit, you hear?

57
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:58,570
This is the last I'm gonna
take you and your losses.

58
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,888
Dear Mr. Potter

59
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:16,625
The Ministry has received intelligence.

60
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,360
That at 6:23 this evening...

61
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:24,366
You performed the Petrunas Charm
in the presence of a muggle.

62
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:27,901
As a clear violation of the decree...

63
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,973
for the reasonable restriction
of Underage Sorcery,

64
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:34,909
you are hereby expelled
from Hogwarts School.

65
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:41,605
Hope that you are well, Mafilda Hopker.

66
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:48,016
Justice.

67
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:20,185
Sorry, Hedwig.

68
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,151
Hygienist, these muggles.

69
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:24,082
Tonks, for God's sake.

70
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:31,465
Professor Moody, what're you doing here?

71
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,797
To rescue you of course.

72
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,339
Where are we going? That I'm
just expelled from school.

73
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:40,806
Not yet.

74
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:41,892
Kingsley, you take front.

75
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:42,908
But the letter said...

76
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:45,145
Dumbledore has persuaded
the Minister to suspend it.

77
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,947
It's about your formal hearing.

78
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:48,113
A hearing?

79
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:49,181
Don't worry, Harry.

80
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,218
We'll explain everything when
we get back to headquarters.

81
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:54,119
Shh, not here, Nymphadora.

82
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:58,188
Don't call me Nymphadora.

83
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:05,163
Stay in formation everyone.

84
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:08,292
Don't digress if one of us was killed.

85
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:59,254
Come on.

86
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:39,056
In you go, son.

87
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,073
It is time to enter in action.

88
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,881
It is the first sorcerer's thought.

89
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:04,688
He thinks with your return...

90
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,577
Talk a little lower

91
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:10,945
He grew stronger by the
minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,837
- Harry!
- Mrs. Weasley!

93
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,649
Thank God, you're alright.

94
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:29,689
Bit pity. I'm afraid, dinner, we're gonna
have to wait after the meeting finish.

95
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,471
Look. No time to explain.

96
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,529
Straight upstairs.
First door on the left.

97
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:35,684
Yeah.

98
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:46,010
What kind of scum would
let it in to her house.

99
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,380
why my mistress, what
would he tell the creature?

100
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,144
What a shame

101
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:12,986
Do not worry, madame.
The creature is here.

102
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,632
Harry.

103
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:24,075
You alright? We've heard
of the Dementors attack.

104
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,712
You must tell us everything.
Let him breath, Hermione.

105
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:30,883
And this hearing at the
Ministry, it's just outrageous.

106
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:34,751
They can't expel you.
It's completely unfair.

107
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,313
Yeah. That's a lot
going around these days.

108
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,855
So what is this place?

109
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,655
It's headquarters.

110
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,495
The Order of The Phoenix.

111
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,265
It's a secret society.

112
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,260
Dumbledore formed it back
in the first, You-Know-Who.

113
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,260
You couldn't write any of
this in your letter I suppose?

114
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,570
Whole summer without a scrap of news.

115
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,560
We thought to write, really, I did.

116
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,240
Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

117
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,980
Dumbledore said that?

118
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,090
But why he want to keep me
in the dark? Maybe I can help.

119
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,020
Afterall, I'm the one who
saw Voldermort returned.

120
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,220
I'm the one he fought with.

121
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,090
I'm the one who saw
Cedric Diggory get killed.

122
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,360
Harry.
Don't be so uptight.

123
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,230
Let it out.

124
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,730
Anyway, we heard the chatting.

125
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,760
Only had something more interesting.

126
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,200
Harry has the right to know.

127
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,140
If it wasn't him, no one know he's back.

128
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,210
He's hardly a child, Molly.

129
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,710
But not an adult either.

130
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,680
He's not James, Sirius.

131
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,080
He's not your son.

132
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,810
I'm good at it.

133
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,590
No one else he's got.

134
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,250
He's got me.

135
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,890
Potter will grow up into a criminal.

136
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,930
Just like his Godfather.

137
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,230
Stay out of this, Severus.

138
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,590
Why don't you tell him?

139
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,261
Hermione, I hate your cat.

140
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,061
We'll be eating down in the kitchen.

141
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:20,343
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now,

142
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:23,535
does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

143
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:24,648
Hi, mom.

144
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:27,483
You hungry, Harry?

145
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:30,659
You sure you're alright, Harry?

146
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:32,003
Harry Potter.

147
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,117
Sirius.

148
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:44,158
It is very peculiar. It seems that your
hearing at the Ministry...

149
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:47,794
is to be before the entire Withem.

150
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:50,146
I don't understand why is the
Ministry of Magic go against me.

151
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:52,027
Show him.

152
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:54,057
He'd find out soon enough.

153
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:03,607
"The Boy Who Lies?"

154
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,843
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

155
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,531
"Fudge: All Is Well"

156
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,267
Fudge is using all his power.

157
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:12,680
Including his influence
at the Daily Prophet.

158
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:16,697
Smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord
has returned. - Why?

159
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,178
The Minister thinks
Dumbledore's after his job.

160
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,187
But that's insane. No one in the right
mind would believe that Dumbledore...

161
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,918
Excatly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.

162
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,193
He's been twisted and walked by fear.

163
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:32,964
Fear makes people do a lot of things.
The last time Voldermort gain power...

164
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,041
He almost destroyed
everything we hold on stand.

165
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:40,436
Now he has returned, I'm afraid the
Minister will do almost anything...

166
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:43,582
to avoid facing the terrifying truth.

167
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:47,744
We think Voldermort wants
to build up his army again.

168
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,823
14 years ago he had huge
armies in his command.

169
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:55,230
Not just witches to wizards

170
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,232
But a lot of dark creatures.

171
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:02,678
He's been recruiting, we've
been attempted to do the same.

172
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:07,015
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested.

173
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:15,047
We believe Voldermort
may be after something.

174
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:16,214
Sirius.

175
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,190
Something he didn't have last time.

176
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:25,832
You mean, like a weapon?

177
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:29,907
No, that's enough. He's just a boy!

178
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:33,064
You say much more, you might as
well inducting him to the Order.

179
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,320
Good. I want to join.

180
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:37,140
If Voldermort's recruiting
the army then I want to fight.

181
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,112
Harry.

182
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,182
You are hereby expelled.

183
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,184
Before the whole Withom.

184
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,678
The trains. Underground.

185
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,681
Genius of the muggles.

186
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:27,973
Here we are.

187
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:32,611
I've never use this entrance before.

188
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,215
It should be fun.

189
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,164
I'll just get my money.

190
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,642
"Dubledore
- Deaf or Dangerous?"

191
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:46,613
Good morning, Arthur.

192
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,632
Morning, Bob.

193
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:53,110
Inter Department Memos.

194
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,499
Used to use owls.

195
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,781
Thank you, Kingsley.

196
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,426
- They changed schedule of your audience.
- When is it?

197
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,729
In 5 minutes.

198
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,149
Mysteries department.

199
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:28,519
Minister, you is going to
do what is right, is not it?

200
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:30,277
Yes, the dream oughts to...

201
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:40,998
Mind you, in the audience only
talks when they talk to you.

202
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:42,494
Keep calm

203
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,242
It did nothing wrong.

204
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:47,728
As they say at bundles:
"The truth is going to appear".

205
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:50,177
Yes?

206
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:52,890
Fear that can't come in.

207
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:56,605
Good luck, Harry.

208
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:03,433
Diciplinary Hearing of 12th August,

209
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:06,595
into offences commited
by Harry James Potter...

210
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:10,210
resident at no. 4,
Privet drive, Winshik,

211
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:11,749
solicitor Cornelius Fudge...

212
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,665
Witness for Defense.

213
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,345
Albus Persidol Wilfred...

214
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:21,327
Brown Dumbledore.

215
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,471
You got our message that
the time and place...

216
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,475
of the hearing has
been changed, did you?

217
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,880
I must have missed it.

218
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:32,957
But by mistake, I arrived at
the Ministry 3 hours early.

219
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:36,412
Charges?

220
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:39,515
The charges against the
accused are as follows...

221
00:20:39,516 --> 00:20:41,108
that he did knowingly,

222
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,683
and in full aware this
legality of his action...

223
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:47,441
but use the Petrunas Charm
in the presence of a muggle.

224
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,824
Do you deny producing said Petrun?

225
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,781
And you were aware that you're
forbidden from using magic...

226
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,286
outside school while
under the age of 17?

227
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:00,434
Yes, of course, but...

228
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:02,591
Dear witches and wizards

229
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:05,648
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

230
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:10,235
Dementors? In Little Winchik?

231
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,711
That's very clever.

232
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:17,515
Muggles can't see
Dementors, can they, boy?

233
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:20,995
I'm not lying. There were
2 of them. If I hadn't...

234
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,198
Enough!

235
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,506
I'm sorry to interrupt what have
showed in a very well heard story.

236
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:29,261
But since you can produce
not witnesses of the event...

237
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:34,423
I admit, Minister. Where
as it happens, we can.

238
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,974
Please describe the attack.

239
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:44,447
What did they look like?

240
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:50,725
One of them was very large,
and the other one was skinny.

241
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:54,678
Not the boys. The Dementors.

242
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:56,951
Alright. They are big.

243
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:00,910
Clothed.

244
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,630
Then... everything went cold.

245
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:08,068
Like all of the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,151
Now, look here.

247
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:13,156
Dementors don't just wander
into a muggle suburban.

248
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:14,808
Happen to cross with a wizard.

249
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,067
The odds are termolecule.

250
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:19,409
I don't think anyone would've believe...

251
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,680
that the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

252
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:27,235
I'm sure I must've
misunderstood you, professor

253
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:32,102
Dementors are after all, under
the control of Ministry of Magics.

254
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:37,248
So silly but it sounded,
for moment as though,

255
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:41,780
you're suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

256
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:44,494
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Under-Secretary.

257
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:48,793
Which claim for the Ministry
to put a full scale enquiry...

258
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:52,354
into why the 2 Dementors were
surveiling far from Azkaban...

259
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:55,137
and why they attack
without the authorization?

260
00:22:56,158 --> 00:23:00,764
Of course there is someone
who might be behind the attack.

261
00:23:02,404 --> 00:23:05,383
Cornelius, I employ you to see wiz.

262
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:09,591
The evidence the Dark Lord have
returned is incontrovertible.

263
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:12,145
He's not back!

264
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,021
In the matter of Harry Potter

265
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,889
The Law say in this states,

266
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:29,088
that magic may be used before
muggles in life threatening situation.

267
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:32,419
Laws can be changed if
necessary, Dubledore.

268
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,589
Really? To bring up tight
older folk criminal trial...

269
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,627
to deal with a simple
matter of Underage Magic?

270
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,547
Raise, in favor of conviction.

271
00:23:58,682 --> 00:24:03,648
Those in favor of clearing
the accuse of all charges.

272
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:19,180
Clear up all charges.

273
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,718
Professor!

274
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:40,054
Badfoot, are you barking mad?

275
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,270
It is going to deteriorate
all the operation.

276
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:51,850
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If someone sees you...

277
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:53,620
I had to see you off tonight.

278
00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:57,858
What's life without a little risk?

279
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:01,009
I don't want to see you get
trapped back into Azkaban.

280
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,672
Don't worry about me.

281
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:07,367
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

282
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,544
Orginal Order of the Phoenix.

283
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:18,060
Marlene McKenine.

284
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:21,326
She was killed 2 weeks
after this was taken.

285
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:24,216
Voldermort wiped out her entire family.

286
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:26,616
Franklin and Ellis Longbottom.

287
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:28,308
Neville's parents.

288
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:31,664
They suffered a foughtless death.

289
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,102
It's been 14 years.

290
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:40,985
There isn't a day goes
by I don't miss your dad.

291
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:47,788
Do you really think there's
gonna be a war, Sirius?

292
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:53,061
It feels like it did before.

293
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,933
You keep it.

294
00:25:59,762 --> 00:26:03,893
Anyway, I suppose you're
the young ones now.

295
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,102
Bye...

296
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:14,609
Hi, Harry Potter.

297
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,946
I suppose the Ministry don't
let you walk out free, Potter.

298
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:03,396
You better enjoy while you can.

299
00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:06,436
Or else a prison in Azkaban
will have your name on it.

300
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:10,436
what I talked you

301
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,627
- Completely crazy.
- Stay far from me!

302
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:15,797
It is Malfoy.

303
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,450
what it waited?

304
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:39,532
Hi guys.

305
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:41,148
Hi, Neville.

306
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,568
What is it?

307
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,376
That. Pulling the carriage.

308
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:03,966
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

309
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:06,898
It's moving itself, like always.

310
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:22,100
You are not mad.

311
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,104
I can see them too.

312
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:30,624
You're just the sane as I am.

313
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:37,442
Everyone, this is Lunanut...

314
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:42,205
Luna Lovegood.

315
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,188
Interesting necklace.

316
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:50,926
It's a charm actually.

317
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,667
Keeps away the Naragos.

318
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,827
I'm hungry. I hope there's a pudding.

319
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:05,040
What's a Naragos?

320
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:06,041
No idea.

321
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:20,792
Good evening, children.

322
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:25,090
Now we have 2 changes
in staff this year.

323
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:27,987
Please welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank.

324
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,491
Who'd be taking care
of magical creatures,

325
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:34,093
while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leaves.

326
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:40,273
We're also pleased to welcome our
new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher,

327
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:41,679
Professor Dolores Umbridge.

328
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:46,808
I'm sure you all will join me in
wishing the professor good luck.

329
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:51,823
I assume as care taken of
Mr. Filch is to remind you...

330
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,997
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

331
00:30:02,998 --> 00:30:07,866
Thank you, headmaster for
those kind words of welcome.

332
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:14,557
And how lovely to see all
your bright, happy faces...

333
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:16,560
smiling up to me.

334
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:21,765
I'm sure we'll all going
to be very good friends.

335
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:23,768
That's likely. -That's likely.

336
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:29,941
The Ministry of Magic,
has always considered...

337
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:33,133
the education of young
witches and wizards...

338
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:35,440
to be a vital importance.

339
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:40,206
Although each headmaster
has brought something new...

340
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:42,210
to this historic school.

341
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:50,555
Progress of the seek of
progress must be dicovered.

342
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,243
Let us preserve what must be preserved.

343
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:58,839
Perfect what can't be perfected...

344
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:04,782
And proove actism, in
order to beat pro-imitate.

345
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:13,903
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.

346
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:15,906
That really was constant minimizing.

347
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,073
Minimizing? What?

348
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:20,225
What does it mean?

349
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,023
Means the Ministry interfering Hogwarts.

350
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:49,109
Dean, Seamus, good holiday?

351
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,204
Better than Seamus' actually.

352
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,232
My mom didn't want me
to come back this year.

353
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,708
Why not?

354
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,801
Let me see, because of you.

355
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:01,890
The Daily Prophet has been saying
a lot of things about you, Harry.

356
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:02,949
And about Dumbledore.

357
00:32:02,984 --> 00:32:04,008
Your mom believes them?

358
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:06,399
Well, nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

359
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,387
Well, I guess you should read the
Prophet like your stupid mother.

360
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:09,949
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

361
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,512
Don't you dare tell me.

362
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,129
I'll never let go anyone
that calls me a liar.

363
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,130
What's going on?

364
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,271
He is what's going on.

365
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:19,979
Do you believe him?
Yeah, I do.

366
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:23,284
Does anyone else got
a problem with Harry?

367
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:32,611
You alright?
Fine.

368
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,348
Seamus was backout there.

369
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:38,316
He'll go through it. We'll see.

370
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,966
I said I'm fine, Ron.

371
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,776
Alright. I just leave
you to your thought, huh?

372
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:17,561
Harry...

373
00:33:34,256 --> 00:33:36,320
Come on, Seamus, go on, get it

374
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:54,027
Good morning, children

375
00:33:55,695 --> 00:34:00,614
Ordinary Wizarding Level Examinations

376
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:07,936
Well, commonly known as... OWLS

377
00:34:08,397 --> 00:34:11,596
Study hard and you'll be awarded

378
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,639
Failed to do so, and the
consequences maybe... severe

379
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,078
Your previous instruction subjects
have been disturbingly uneven

380
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,777
But please to know from now on...

381
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:32,471
You'll be following
a carefully structured

382
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:35,786
Ministry approved
course of defensive magic

383
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:36,689
Yes?

384
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,973
.. there isn't something about
using the defensive spells

385
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:41,402
Using spells?

386
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:44,358
Why would you need
spells in my classroom?

387
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:47,212
We aren't using magics

388
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:52,649
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risks-free way

389
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,750
We're gonna be attacked,
it won't be risks-free

390
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:58,713
Do raise their hands
when speak in my class

391
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,466
It's the view of the ministry

392
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:07,620
That a theoretical
knowledge'll be sufficient...

393
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:09,217
To get you thru your
examinations, which after all...

394
00:35:09,218 --> 00:35:12,638
Is what schools are all about

395
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:15,610
And how's theories supposed
to prepare us for out there?

396
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:17,343
There's nothing out there, dear

397
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:21,031
Who do you imagine'd attack
children like yourselves?

398
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:23,543
I don't know, maybe Lord Voldermort

399
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:33,868
Noe let's don't make this quiet plan

400
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:35,775
very clear.

401
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:39,932
You've been told...

402
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:43,783
That a certain dark wizard
is at large once again

403
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:47,317
This's a lie

404
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:50,855
This isn't a lie, I saw him, I
fought.. -Detention, Mr Potter

405
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,396
So, according to your say,
Diggory dropped of his own?

406
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:53,842
Then second you, Cedrico
Diggory fell dead why he wanted.

407
00:35:53,843 --> 00:35:56,196
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident

408
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,257
He was murdered, Voldermort
killed him, you must know that

409
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:01,363
Enough... enough!

410
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:05,517
See me later, Mr Potter... my office

411
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:29,858
Come in

412
00:36:34,963 --> 00:36:36,666
Good evening, Mr Potter

413
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:38,835
Sit

414
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,291
You're gonna be doing some
lines for me today, Mr Potter

415
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,281
No, not with your quill

416
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,019
Cause you're gonna be using
a rather special 1 of mine

417
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:01,783
Now...

418
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:04,471
I want you to write:

419
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:08,524
"I should not tell lies".

420
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:12,149
How many times?

421
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:14,536
See...

422
00:37:14,537 --> 00:37:17,013
the enough for the message penetrate.

423
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,585
You haven't given me any ink

424
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:23,415
You won't need any inks

425
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:02,319
"I should not tell lies".

426
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,552
Well?

427
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:21,382
Nothing

428
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:22,880
That's rite

429
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:27,520
Because you know deep down

430
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:30,514
You deserved to be punished

431
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:33,222
Don't you, Mr Potter?

432
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:39,015
Go on

433
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:49,956
Diving snack box

434
00:38:49,957 --> 00:38:50,958
It'll get you outta class

435
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:55,507
Let's take hours of
pleasures outta school boredom

436
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,981
You want for another?

437
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:01,470
I'm not asking you to write for me

438
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,700
I'm just busy studying this stupid exams

439
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:07,142
I'll do the introductions for you

440
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:10,601
Hermione, you're the most
wonderful person I've ever known

441
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:12,564
I'll never be rude to you again

442
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,353
Only I bet you will

443
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,367
What's wrong with your hand?

444
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:21,386
Nothing

445
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,375
The other hand

446
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,909
You've gotta tell Dumbledore

447
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:31,428
No, Dumbledore's got
enough in his mind rite now

448
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:34,204
Anyway I won't get
Umbridge's satisfaction

449
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,415
Bloody hell she was torturing you

450
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,451
If your parents know about this...

451
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:40,022
Yeah, I haven't got any parents, have I?

452
00:39:43,169 --> 00:39:45,097
Harry, you've gotta report this

453
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:48,422
- It's very simple...
- No, is not.

454
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:52,206
Hermione, be what it
may is not that simple.

455
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,801
You don't understand.

456
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,266
But I want to understand.

457
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:16,238
Dear Malfoot, I hope you're allright

458
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:18,194
It's getting cooler here

459
00:40:18,571 --> 00:40:20,530
Winter's definitely on the way

460
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,919
Despite I've been back to Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever

461
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:32,042
I know you but all
people will understand

462
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:06,436
Hello Harry Potter

463
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:12,120
Your feet, aren't you cold?

464
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:13,436
A bit

465
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:18,700
Unfortunately of my shoes
of mystery have disappeared

466
00:41:19,754 --> 00:41:22,185
Suspect who Narguilés
be for trás of this.

467
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:30,131
What are they?

468
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:31,733
The Carl Pastro

469
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:35,278
They're gentle really, but...

470
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,084
People avoid them
because, they've been...

471
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:42,381
Different

472
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,368
Why can't the others see?

473
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:51,159
They can only been by
people who's in death

474
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:56,367
So you know someone who's gone?

475
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:57,678
My mum

476
00:41:58,811 --> 00:42:01,449
She was quiet an extraordinary witch

477
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,676
She did a lot of experiments though

478
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:06,323
One day 1 of her spells went badly wrong

479
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,404
I was 9

480
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:09,889
I'm sorry

481
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,620
It wasn't that hard

482
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:14,864
I do feel very sad about it sometimes

483
00:42:15,503 --> 00:42:17,129
But I have a dad

484
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,415
By the way my dad and i believe you

485
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,871
And you fought him

486
00:42:27,872 --> 00:42:30,975
Everything's extremely tough for
you consipring against Dumbledore

487
00:42:30,976 --> 00:42:34,604
Thanks, seems that
you're the only who does

488
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:36,972
I don't think that's true

489
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,334
But I suppose that's the way
he wants you if you feel.

490
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,507
What do you mean?

491
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:46,516
If I were the other one

492
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:49,697
I don't want you to feel
crowd from anyone else

493
00:42:50,606 --> 00:42:56,045
Because if it's just you alone...
you aren't much as a threat

494
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:12,166
Would you ever stop eating?

495
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:14,279
I'm hungry

496
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,112
Harry

497
00:43:20,981 --> 00:43:22,359
Can I join you?

498
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:27,480
Prof, what exactly are you insinuating?

499
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:30,453
And you requesting when
I punished my students

500
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:34,026
You conformed to prescribe
disciplinary practices

501
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:36,523
Seems silly but certain...

502
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:40,365
That you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom

503
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,811
Minerva

504
00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:44,122
Not at all, Dolores

505
00:43:44,476 --> 00:43:46,656
Just their medieval methods.

506
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:49,173
I'm sorry, dear

507
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:52,926
But to question my practices
is to question the ministry

508
00:43:52,928 --> 00:43:55,920
And by extension, the minister himself

509
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:57,750
I'm a tolerant woman

510
00:43:57,867 --> 00:44:00,749
But the 1 thing I won't
stand for is disloyalty

511
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,343
It is disloyalty.

512
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:06,153
Disloyalty?

513
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:11,378
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared

514
00:44:12,145 --> 00:44:14,851
.. will take immediate actions

515
00:44:25,805 --> 00:44:27,222
What happened to Dumbledore?

516
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,727
Umbridge revolutionised
the teaching of defence

517
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:45,764
To repress the seriously falling
standards of Hagwarts school

518
00:44:53,266 --> 00:44:55,175
Just 1 question

519
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:59,507
You've been in this post
for how long exactly?

520
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:08,638
It registered before for the position in
the Defense against Arts of the Darkness.

521
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,285
Is that correct?
Yes

522
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,110
But you were unsuccessful

523
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:18,345
Obviously

524
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:52,219
Would you predict
something, please?

525
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:54,954
I'm sorry

526
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:01,740
Move their mouths.

527
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:11,093
1 tiny apocalypse?

528
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,825
Pity

529
00:46:19,762 --> 00:46:22,875
No, wait... I think
1 do see something, yes

530
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,426
I saw something dark

531
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:28,422
You're in a great danger

532
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:31,830
Good

533
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:43,064
Cho, what's going on?

534
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:45,150
It's professor, Trelawney

535
00:47:12,178 --> 00:47:15,310
16 years I've been here to teach

536
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,997
Hogwarts is my home

537
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:22,132
You can't do this

538
00:47:23,993 --> 00:47:25,702
Actually I can

539
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:33,677
Minerva

540
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,354
Something you'd like to say, dear?

541
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:38,889
Oh there're several
things I'd like to say

542
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,386
Dear... calm.

543
00:47:54,714 --> 00:47:56,160
Prof McGonagall

544
00:47:56,617 --> 00:47:59,336
May I ask you to escort
Sybil back inside?

545
00:48:00,432 --> 00:48:01,799
Sybil, come here

546
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,673
Thank you, Dumbledore

547
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,563
Dumbledore, may I remind you

548
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:13,535
Under the tone of educational decree
#23 as it acted by the minister

549
00:48:13,536 --> 00:48:15,806
You've the right to dismiss my teacher

550
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:20,225
But you don't have the authority
to banish them from the garden

551
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,655
That power remained with the headmaster

552
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:26,374
For now

553
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:34,688
Don't you have studying to do?

554
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,327
Professor?

555
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:38,953
Professor?

556
00:48:39,546 --> 00:48:42,158
Professor Dumbledore? Professor?

557
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,006
Professor Dumbledore?

558
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,034
That cursed gargul.

559
00:48:57,861 --> 00:48:59,592
We aren't learning
how to defend ourselves

560
00:48:59,899 --> 00:49:02,029
We aren't learning how to pass our OWLS

561
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:05,004
She's taking over the entire school

562
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:09,822
Security's and will remian
the ministry's top priority

563
00:49:09,857 --> 00:49:12,889
Furthermore, we've convincing evidence

564
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,299
That these disappearances
are the work of...

565
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:19,709
The notorious mass
murderer, Sirius Black...

566
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:21,017
Harry

567
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,702
Sirius

568
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:25,713
What are you doing here?

569
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:26,715
Return your letter

570
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,859
You said you're worried about Umbridge

571
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,250
What's she doing? Trying to
train you to kill the half-breed?

572
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:34,192
She isn't letting us to use magic at all

573
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:35,827
I'm not surprised

574
00:49:35,828 --> 00:49:39,755
The latest intelligence says that
Fudge doesn't wanna train in combat

575
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,981
Combat?

576
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:43,779
He afraid we're forming
some sort of wizard army?

577
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,353
This's exactly what he thinks

578
00:49:45,388 --> 00:49:49,169
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the ministry

579
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,318
He's becoming more crack on the edge

580
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:57,269
The others wouldn't want
me to tell you this, Harry

581
00:49:57,614 --> 00:50:00,199
Things aren't going well at all, the order

582
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:02,597
Fudge's blocking the truth

583
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:06,972
These disappearances are the
same, that's how it started before

584
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:10,893
Voldermort is on the move

585
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:13,157
What do we do?

586
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:17,043
Someone is coming, I'm
sorry I can't be more help

587
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:22,005
But for now, it looks
like you're on your own

588
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:32,507
He's out there isn't he?

589
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:36,968
We've gotta be able to defend ourselves

590
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:42,017
If Umbridge refuses to teach
us how we need someone who'll

591
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:43,850
Harry

592
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,590
This is mad, who wants
me teach anything?

593
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:13,594
I'm a nut, remember?

594
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:15,801
You can't be any worse than her, anyway

595
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,002
Thanks, Ron

596
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:19,640
Anything, mate

597
00:51:20,772 --> 00:51:22,494
Who supposed to make this?

598
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:24,635
Just we're

599
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,441
Not as bad

600
00:51:35,145 --> 00:51:37,941
Well, at least safer than being tracked

601
00:51:37,942 --> 00:51:39,065
Hey come back here

602
00:51:46,348 --> 00:51:47,601
Hi.

603
00:51:48,073 --> 00:51:49,226
So...

604
00:51:49,508 --> 00:51:51,258
We know why we're here

605
00:51:51,293 --> 00:51:52,694
We need a teacher

606
00:51:53,836 --> 00:51:55,599
Proper teacher

607
00:51:56,443 --> 00:51:59,946
One has really experienced to
defend himself against the dark arts

608
00:51:59,981 --> 00:52:01,126
Why? -Why?

609
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,852
Because You-knows-who
it came back, idiot.

610
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,828
So as Harry says

611
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:07,556
So Dumbledore says before Harry said?

612
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,601
The point is where's the proof?

613
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:15,179
Perhaps Harry could tell us
more about Diggory got killed

614
00:52:17,565 --> 00:52:19,313
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric

615
00:52:19,314 --> 00:52:21,410
That isn't why you're
here, or we can clear up now

616
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:25,124
Come on Hermione, let's go,
these are some sorts freaks

617
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:27,479
Is that true you can teach us chant?

618
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:31,950
Yes.

619
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,123
I've seen it

620
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:37,701
I don't know you can do that?

621
00:52:38,252 --> 00:52:39,923
He killed a Basalese...

622
00:52:40,496 --> 00:52:42,467
With a sword in Dumbledore's office

623
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:51,222
And last year he really
did fight who went to flash

624
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:53,627
Wait

625
00:52:54,168 --> 00:52:57,645
Those sound great when you
say it like that, but...

626
00:52:58,027 --> 00:53:00,171
In fact, I was just lucky

627
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:02,159
I didn't know what I was
doing half of the time

628
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,261
I nearly always had help

629
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:07,584
He's just being modest
- No, Hermione, I'm not

630
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:14,127
Facing these stuff in real
life isn't like in school

631
00:53:15,415 --> 00:53:18,626
It isn't like you made a mistake
you can try just try again tomorrow

632
00:53:18,627 --> 00:53:20,308
But out there

633
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:24,323
When you're a second
away from being murdered

634
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,288
Or watching a friend
die rite before your eyes

635
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,448
You don't know how it's like

636
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:43,594
You're rite, Harry, we don't

637
00:53:44,852 --> 00:53:46,540
That's why we need your help

638
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:49,565
Because the one we try of beating...

639
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,406
Voldermort

640
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:58,001
He's coming back?

641
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,560
"Dumbledore Army"

642
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:22,781
1st we need to find a place
where Umbridge won't find out

643
00:54:22,782 --> 00:54:24,378
That's too small

644
00:54:24,983 --> 00:54:27,215
- The prohibited forest?
- It is not going to come out right

645
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:30,392
Harry, what happened if
Umbridge does find out?

646
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:35,154
Who cares? I mean...
it"s exciting, isn't it?

647
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,799
Breaking the rules

648
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,551
Who are you and what did
with Hermione Granger?

649
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:43,469
Finally, at least know a thing
certainly of this meeting.

650
00:54:43,682 --> 00:54:44,962
Which?

651
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:48,964
For the next few days we should...

652
00:54:51,979 --> 00:54:56,005
All come to this place and practise

653
00:54:57,936 --> 00:55:01,386
We gotta make sure Umbridge
won't find out this place

654
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:13,146
All student organisations disbanded

655
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:16,614
Watch way you're going

656
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:20,396
You've done it
It where is going Longbottom?

657
00:55:54,706 --> 00:55:56,133
You got Neville.

658
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:58,332
You found the Room Needs.

659
00:55:59,038 --> 00:56:00,173
Which room?

660
00:56:00,396 --> 00:56:02,329
This's also called
come-and-go-room

661
00:56:02,678 --> 00:56:05,959
The room only appears when
a person's immediate needs

662
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:08,628
And always is equiped
with that it is needed

663
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:12,088
So, you really needed a toilet?

664
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,367
Charming really

665
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:16,910
But yes.

666
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:19,074
It is this the idea.

667
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,295
It's great

668
00:56:20,598 --> 00:56:23,060
Just like Hogwarts wants to fight back

669
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:35,854
Expelliarm...

670
00:56:40,904 --> 00:56:46,075
You're just flourishing your
stick too much, try like this

671
00:56:46,076 --> 00:56:47,133
Expelliarmus!

672
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,535
Would you please copy
your whole text 4 times

673
00:56:51,811 --> 00:56:54,660
To ensure maximum attention

674
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:56,794
You don't need to talk

675
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:58,797
I think it's more like it

676
00:56:58,898 --> 00:57:00,152
Expelliarmus.

677
00:57:00,187 --> 00:57:01,491
Ron, awake

678
00:57:13,775 --> 00:57:16,579
Stunning is one of the sorceries
more useful in your arsenal.

679
00:57:16,614 --> 00:57:19,321
It is an essential artifice
for the sorcerer, so...

680
00:57:19,322 --> 00:57:20,605
Run on, Nigel.

681
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:22,567
Give it your best shot.

682
00:57:28,884 --> 00:57:30,034
Expelliarmus!

683
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,046
Not to bad.
Good, not bad... at all

684
00:57:45,155 --> 00:57:47,540
Don't worry about,
Hermione, we'll go lightly

685
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,143
Thanks, Ron

686
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:53,573
- Come on Ron.
- Come on Ron.

687
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:55,062
Come on Ron.

688
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:56,595
She was already, Ron.

689
00:58:14,062 --> 00:58:15,614
Thank you -Shut up

690
00:58:15,767 --> 00:58:17,506
I let her do that

691
00:58:18,136 --> 00:58:19,782
She wouldn't be bothered.

692
00:58:22,818 --> 00:58:24,669
It's really my intention

693
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,169
"All students will
submit to questioning"

694
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,771
"about activities illicit suspicions".

695
00:58:48,546 --> 00:58:51,406
Come on, do you want a cup of tea?

696
00:58:53,445 --> 00:58:56,796
Focus on the fixed point, try again

697
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,334
Expelliarmus!

698
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:03,345
Very good, keep the concentration.

699
00:59:06,258 --> 00:59:07,287
Right.

700
00:59:08,771 --> 00:59:09,993
a little higher

701
00:59:13,771 --> 00:59:14,993
I'm ok...

702
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:20,826
I'm ok...

703
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:42,711
The ones that they want to join

704
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,063
to the Brigade Inquisitorial
for extra credit,

705
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:47,820
it owes if register
in the High Magic room.

706
00:59:47,899 --> 00:59:49,093
Reducio!

707
00:59:53,476 --> 00:59:57,689
Working hard is important, there's
something be out this even more...

708
00:59:57,968 --> 00:59:59,505
Believing in yourself

709
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,378
Expelliarmus.

710
01:00:02,674 --> 01:00:05,626
Think of this, every
great wizard in history

711
01:00:05,627 --> 01:00:07,123
Started out...

712
01:00:08,378 --> 01:00:12,083
Nothing more than what
we're now... students

713
01:00:12,515 --> 01:00:15,466
If they can do it, why not us?

714
01:00:25,515 --> 01:00:27,466
Expelliarmus.

715
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:45,466
Expelliarmus.

716
01:01:04,044 --> 01:01:05,074
Expelliarmus.

717
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:11,074
Fantastic, well done, mate

718
01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:17,022
So, that's it for this lesson

719
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:20,649
We aren't gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays

720
01:01:20,738 --> 01:01:23,755
So just keep practising
on your own best you can

721
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:26,664
And well done, everyone,
great great work

722
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:51,643
We see us in the communal room, Harry.

723
01:01:53,054 --> 01:01:54,698
- Thank you very much, Harry.
- Not at all

724
01:01:56,597 --> 01:01:57,758
Merry Christmas

725
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:59,301
- Thank you very much
- It was not anything.

726
01:01:59,302 --> 01:02:00,434
Merry Christmas

727
01:02:00,435 --> 01:02:01,864
Thanks. Merry Christmas

728
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:07,372
We was thinking, Harry.

729
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:09,741
We could place some vomitilhas
in the Umbridge's Tea.

730
01:02:09,744 --> 01:02:12,327
Or Febricolate. You say
with some full furuncles..

731
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,912
Sounds great, guys, would you excuse me?

732
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:27,169
Are you all right?

733
01:02:27,862 --> 01:02:30,804
I heard Umbridge gave you
a hard time the other day

734
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:32,329
Yeah, I'm ok

735
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:35,836
It's worth it

736
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:43,394
Just... learning all these

737
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,731
Made me wonder maybe he would...

738
01:02:47,506 --> 01:02:50,724
Cedric... gave me all these stuff

739
01:02:51,584 --> 01:02:53,407
He was really good

740
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:56,997
It was just Voldermort was better

741
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,684
You're a really good teacher, Harry

742
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:07,213
I've never been interested
in any of these before

743
01:03:16,536 --> 01:03:18,085
A visgo.

744
01:03:20,655 --> 01:03:23,584
It probably is full of Narguilés.

745
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:26,078
what São Narguilés?

746
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:28,513
I do not have idea.

747
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:50,467
Well, how was it?

748
01:03:51,325 --> 01:03:55,254
I mean she was sorta crying

749
01:03:55,421 --> 01:03:57,120
Not that bad, are you?

750
01:03:57,442 --> 01:04:00,603
I'm sure Harry's kisisng's
more than satisfactory

751
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,439
Cho's been half of the
time crying these days

752
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:08,008
I bet a longer kiss will cheer her up

753
01:04:09,088 --> 01:04:11,476
You don't know how she must be feeling?

754
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:19,907
It stands to reason that
she is in sad by the Cedrico.

755
01:04:19,942 --> 01:04:23,175
Confused to like Harry, it
feels blamed by tê him kissed.

756
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:26,442
In conflict with Umbridge who wants
fire her mother of the Ministry.

757
01:04:26,477 --> 01:04:30,003
And afraid of do not pass in the NOMS
for being so worried about everything.

758
01:04:31,816 --> 01:04:34,229
A person can not feel all this

759
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,549
She would explode.

760
01:04:35,582 --> 01:04:39,119
That is because your emotional side
it belongs to the size of a teaspoon

761
01:05:02,526 --> 01:05:04,777
Voldemort ought to be behind something.

762
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,361
Something that he did not
get the last time

763
01:05:09,858 --> 01:05:10,893
Harry!

764
01:05:44,705 --> 01:05:47,489
In the dream, where you standing
next to the victim?

765
01:05:48,351 --> 01:05:51,284
- Or looking down at the scene?
- Neighter one.

766
01:05:51,438 --> 01:05:52,603
It was as...

767
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:55,831
Professor, can you tell what's
happening?

768
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:56,963
Everardo.

769
01:05:56,964 --> 01:05:58,625
Arthur is the watchman tonight

770
01:05:58,626 --> 01:06:00,671
I assured him who are
the right people.

771
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:01,750
- Sir..
- Please!

772
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:04,806
Go to your portrait in Grimmauld Place.

773
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:07,517
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is seriously wounded.

774
01:06:07,552 --> 01:06:11,299
And that his sons are going to
arrive there soon, at portal key.

775
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:13,510
they are already theTarget.

776
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,370
It was close but they
think it's going to survive.

777
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:17,931
Once again the Lord of the Darkness
i did not acquire it.

778
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,480
Look at me!

779
01:06:26,207 --> 01:06:28,885
what is happening to with me?

780
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,895
It wish to see me, director?

781
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,516
I'm afraight it can't wait.

782
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:43,023
Not untill the morning.

783
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:45,886
Otherwise, we will be vulnerable.

784
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:55,656
It seems that there is a connection in
the mind of the Lord of the Darkness

785
01:06:55,691 --> 01:06:58,918
Whaether he is aware of the
connection, i don't know

786
01:06:59,153 --> 01:07:01,715
Lets Pray that he continue not to know

787
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:03,695
It means, if he knows about her...

788
01:07:04,505 --> 01:07:07,310
he will be able to read my mind?

789
01:07:07,311 --> 01:07:09,175
Read. Control.

790
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:11,837
Go mad.

791
01:07:13,342 --> 01:07:16,263
It formerly was common
the Lord of the Darkness,

792
01:07:16,264 --> 01:07:19,188
have the pleasure invading
the mind of her victims.

793
01:07:19,223 --> 01:07:23,124
Creating projected images for
torturá them until the madness.

794
01:07:23,725 --> 01:07:27,976
Only after extracting the last
sanity drop.

795
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:31,964
Only when it did them implore
by the death, he finally killed

796
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,106
Used right Oclumência's Power,

797
01:07:36,107 --> 01:07:39,109
it can protegê him of
access or influence.

798
01:07:39,313 --> 01:07:43,144
Nestas classes I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

799
01:07:43,649 --> 01:07:46,974
And you will attempt to resist.

800
01:07:47,513 --> 01:07:49,893
Prepare yourself.

801
01:07:50,063 --> 01:07:51,442
Legilimens!

802
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:56,771
It is your curse.

803
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,468
Concentrate, Potter!

804
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:03,059
Concentration.

805
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:30,443
Merry Christmas

806
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:33,191
There go we!

807
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:35,157
Daddy came back.

808
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:36,246
Thanks.

809
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:42,965
Sit down, everybody, sit
down, now's time for presents

810
01:08:42,966 --> 01:08:45,027
An artistic box for Ron.

811
01:08:45,028 --> 01:08:46,632
A great box for you.

812
01:08:46,633 --> 01:08:47,687
And...

813
01:08:51,185 --> 01:08:52,432
They will go, Abram.

814
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:53,840
I want to see their the guy.

815
01:08:54,704 --> 01:08:56,911
- Try.
- Thank you, mother, is perfect.

816
01:08:56,912 --> 01:08:59,645
- It was what you wanted, actually
- It is.

817
01:08:59,646 --> 01:09:00,891
- Well that, mother.
- It is.

818
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:02,195
It was good.

819
01:09:02,196 --> 01:09:03,660
We go personal, we will do this way.

820
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:05,856
Harry, Harry.

821
01:09:06,858 --> 01:09:08,504
There you are.

822
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,566
Happy Christmas -Thanks

823
01:09:12,076 --> 01:09:13,977
- It seizes that.
- Thanks.

824
01:09:14,012 --> 01:09:15,774
Now the daddy. what is the of the daddy?

825
01:09:16,157 --> 01:09:17,730
- Thanks.
- Did all of them win?

826
01:09:17,731 --> 01:09:19,270
- A toast!
- Fred, George,

827
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,260
- Hermione sees if...
- A Christmas toast!

828
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:23,312
To Mr. Harry Potter.

829
01:09:25,172 --> 01:09:28,004
Without him, I wouln't be here

830
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:33,363
- Harry!
- Harry!

831
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:34,639
Harry!

832
01:09:36,165 --> 01:09:37,415
That is delicious.

833
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:40,847
- I am going to want more of this.
- But daddy, no...

834
01:09:41,021 --> 01:09:43,469
I don't understand why
he didn't wanna wear that

835
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:46,865
Because I keep seeming
an idiot, because of this

836
01:09:46,866 --> 01:09:48,668
Not more than the usual.

837
01:09:56,784 --> 01:10:00,644
arrogant brat stopped
there is courageous.

838
01:10:01,558 --> 01:10:05,911
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the dark lord

839
01:10:06,222 --> 01:10:09,655
Friend of Muggle, traitor of friends...

840
01:10:09,656 --> 01:10:12,189
- If my poor loves
- Monster!

841
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:15,249
reager enough of your vile!
Away with you.

842
01:10:15,604 --> 01:10:17,208
Okay, boss.

843
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:21,638
Monster lives to serve the
noble house of Black.

844
01:10:22,345 --> 01:10:23,743
Sorry about that

845
01:10:24,693 --> 01:10:27,793
He never was very pleasing.
Even when I was boy.

846
01:10:28,653 --> 01:10:30,051
at least, not with me.

847
01:10:31,587 --> 01:10:33,517
The what? Were you created here?

848
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,264
This is my parents' house.

849
01:10:36,272 --> 01:10:39,388
For Dumbledore's
Headquarters for the order

850
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,704
Maybe the only useful
place I've been able to do

851
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:48,009
This's the Black's family tree

852
01:10:48,976 --> 01:10:50,754
My cousin

853
01:10:51,266 --> 01:10:53,353
I hated too much.

854
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:57,943
My parents pure blood

855
01:11:02,082 --> 01:11:04,840
My mother tried another way

856
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,209
charming woman.

857
01:11:09,994 --> 01:11:11,201
I was 16

858
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,003
Where did you go?

859
01:11:15,982 --> 01:11:17,387
Close to my dads.

860
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:20,583
I always was welcome at Potters.

861
01:11:21,947 --> 01:11:23,957
I've seen so much of you, Harry

862
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:27,091
You and i are so pretty much alike.

863
01:11:28,436 --> 01:11:30,073
I'm not that sure.

864
01:11:31,437 --> 01:11:33,327
Sirius, when I was...

865
01:11:35,615 --> 01:11:39,645
When I saw Mr Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching

866
01:11:40,139 --> 01:11:42,510
I was the snake.

867
01:11:43,523 --> 01:11:46,391
And afterwards at Dumbledore's office

868
01:11:46,504 --> 01:11:49,008
There was a moment
when I... I wanted to...

869
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:56,742
This connection between
me and Voldermort

870
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:01,311
The reason for it... is that
I'm the coming one like him

871
01:12:02,176 --> 01:12:04,742
I just feel so angry all the time

872
01:12:05,168 --> 01:12:06,607
The whole time.

873
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,243
And what if everything
that I've been thru

874
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:14,206
something gave wrong within me?

875
01:12:14,207 --> 01:12:15,784
Inside me what if I'm becoming bad?

876
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,457
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry

877
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:24,785
You aren't a bad person

878
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:29,393
You're a good person
that bad things happen to

879
01:12:31,022 --> 01:12:32,215
Do you understand?

880
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:39,740
The world isn't spliting
to good people and deaths

881
01:12:39,741 --> 01:12:42,832
People got both bright and dark inside

882
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:47,008
What matters is about choose the right1

883
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,041
That is what we really are.

884
01:12:55,386 --> 01:12:56,804
Harry, we got to get going.

885
01:12:58,822 --> 01:13:02,481
When all these are over,
we'll be a proper family

886
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:04,378
You are going to see.

887
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:43,020
It did same?

888
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:44,408
Harry!

889
01:13:44,597 --> 01:13:47,275
Harry... Hagrid's back

890
01:13:50,987 --> 01:13:52,283
I'm sorry.

891
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:09,033
I am going to talk that by last time

892
01:14:10,089 --> 01:14:12,671
I order you to tell
me where have you been?

893
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:15,050
I told you, I've been away for my health

894
01:14:15,052 --> 01:14:16,956
- Your health?
- Yes.

895
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:18,939
A bid of fresh air, you know?

896
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:21,180
Oh yes, as game keeper

897
01:14:21,181 --> 01:14:24,183
Fresh air must be difficult to come by

898
01:14:26,096 --> 01:14:28,844
If I were you, I shouldn't get
too used to being back in fact...

899
01:14:28,845 --> 01:14:31,850
I might not be unpacking at all

900
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:50,621
That is top secret, right?

901
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:54,947
Dumbledore sending me
to party with the giants

902
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,086
Giant?

903
01:14:57,698 --> 01:14:58,937
Did you find them

904
01:14:58,938 --> 01:15:01,559
Well, they aren't that hard
to be found, to be honest

905
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,912
They are so great, are not they?

906
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:06,332
I talked to them to join the class

907
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:09,360
But I wasn't the only one
who tried to win them over

908
01:15:09,928 --> 01:15:11,764
- Guests of the death.
- Yes.

909
01:15:12,372 --> 01:15:15,415
Trying to persuade them
to join you know whom

910
01:15:16,071 --> 01:15:18,581
I gave him Dumbledore's mesage

911
01:15:18,582 --> 01:15:21,697
Supposed someone'll remember
he was great to, I supposed

912
01:15:25,527 --> 01:15:29,380
- And did they do that to you
- Not exactly.

913
01:15:30,996 --> 01:15:33,390
Go on, you have it, Dolvy dog

914
01:15:48,123 --> 01:15:52,183
It's strange out there,
just like last time

915
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:55,118
There is a storm coming, Harry.

916
01:15:55,786 --> 01:15:58,300
We all must be ready when it does

917
01:16:32,371 --> 01:16:35,454
We confirm that 10 prisoners
extremely dangerous,

918
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,571
at the beginning of
night yesterday's escaped.

919
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:42,241
Of course the Prime minister
bundle was warned of the danger.

920
01:16:42,242 --> 01:16:44,763
We have a great suspicion,

921
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:48,067
We strongly suspect the
breakout was planed

922
01:16:48,068 --> 01:16:51,403
By a man who's experience in Azkaban

923
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:56,071
Notorious mass murderer, Sirius Black

924
01:16:56,867 --> 01:17:00,356
He is cousin of the
fugitive, Belatrix Lestrange.

925
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:05,586
"Mass breakout from Azkaban"

926
01:17:11,555 --> 01:17:13,564
Dumbledore warned Fudge of this
was going to happen

927
01:17:13,995 --> 01:17:16,507
He is going to finish killing
for not facing the truth.

928
01:17:17,377 --> 01:17:18,370
Harry.

929
01:17:19,608 --> 01:17:23,544
I... I wanna apologize

930
01:17:24,605 --> 01:17:27,981
Now until my mother tells that
the Prophet is not so right.

931
01:17:29,015 --> 01:17:32,230
So, what I'm really
trying to say is that...

932
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:34,283
I believe in you.

933
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:41,614
Neville?

934
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:56,092
14 years ago

935
01:17:56,843 --> 01:18:00,763
A death eater named Bellatric Lestrange

936
01:18:01,262 --> 01:18:03,907
Used to excruciate my parents

937
01:18:04,659 --> 01:18:07,212
She tortured them, trying to get info

938
01:18:08,738 --> 01:18:10,422
they did not say anything.

939
01:18:12,653 --> 01:18:14,519
I'm very proud of being son.

940
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:19,491
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for anyone to notice yet

941
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:27,673
We will make them proud, Neville.

942
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,399
That is a promise.

943
01:18:33,953 --> 01:18:38,468
Make it a part of your memory, to be
the happiest thing to remember

944
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:40,762
Keep trying, Simas.

945
01:18:41,302 --> 01:18:42,904
Right, it's your time now.

946
01:18:43,207 --> 01:18:45,001
Expecto Patronum!

947
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:48,676
A fully proto is the
most difficult to achieve

948
01:18:48,677 --> 01:18:53,129
A shield form's also been equally used

949
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,034
Fantastic Gina.

950
01:18:56,409 --> 01:19:00,717
Just remember, it can protect
you as long as you're focus

951
01:19:00,718 --> 01:19:02,176
Just concentrate Luna.

952
01:19:06,457 --> 01:19:09,208
- Think of happy things.
- Expecto Patronum.

953
01:19:10,499 --> 01:19:12,569
I'm trying - I know, you're doing good

954
01:19:13,337 --> 01:19:17,141
This is a very advanced sorcery people,
and you all are doing fine

955
01:20:00,858 --> 01:20:02,647
I'll make short work of it

956
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,947
Hello Potter

957
01:20:06,258 --> 01:20:07,047
Maxim bombard!

958
01:20:23,553 --> 01:20:25,617
Get them

959
01:20:25,717 --> 01:20:28,834
I've been watching them for weeks.
Assembling Dumbledore's Army

960
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:32,518
Proved, that's what I've been
telling you right from the beginning

961
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:37,007
All your fear's coming back, you
know who, this isnt just all of it

962
01:20:38,008 --> 01:20:40,370
We saw your lies for what they where.

963
01:20:40,559 --> 01:20:43,731
A smoke screen for your attempt
to seek control of the Ministry.

964
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:45,188
Naturally - No Professor

965
01:20:45,321 --> 01:20:46,990
He had nothing to do with that,
it was me

966
01:20:47,318 --> 01:20:49,428
Most noble of you Harry trying to
suit me

967
01:20:49,991 --> 01:20:51,933
As it's pointed out,
the name clearly says:

968
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:54,878
Dumbledores army,
not Potters.

969
01:20:55,154 --> 01:20:57,683
I instructed Harry to
form this organization.

970
01:20:57,869 --> 01:21:01,696
And I, i alone i'm responsible
for the activities.

971
01:21:01,718 --> 01:21:03,690
Send an owl to the Daily Prophet.

972
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:06,013
If we hurry we'll still make
the morning edition.

973
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,602
Dolores, Saveboat, you'll
escort Dumbledore...

974
01:21:11,137 --> 01:21:12,558
To Azkaban.

975
01:21:13,552 --> 01:21:18,259
To await trial for
conspiracy and seducing.

976
01:21:18,392 --> 01:21:21,289
Ahh.. I thought it might
hit this little snag

977
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:26,347
You seem to be laboring under the
illusion, that i'll be going to...

978
01:21:26,644 --> 01:21:28,125
What is the frase?

979
01:21:28,336 --> 01:21:29,775
Come Quietly,

980
01:21:30,025 --> 01:21:31,499
Well i can tell you this...

981
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:34,689
I've no intention of going to Azkaban

982
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:35,815
You'll...!

983
01:21:36,163 --> 01:21:37,353
Get him!

984
01:21:51,838 --> 01:21:53,588
You may not like this minister,

985
01:21:54,227 --> 01:21:55,957
but you can't deny...

986
01:21:57,058 --> 01:21:59,026
Dumbledore's got style

987
01:22:17,488 --> 01:22:19,623
Dolores UMBRIDGE SUBSTITTUl
TARGET DUMBLEDORE...

988
01:22:19,658 --> 01:22:21,699
LIKE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL OF HOGWARTS.

989
01:22:21,797 --> 01:22:26,727
Boys and girls can't get closer
then 8 inches of each other

990
01:22:27,027 --> 01:22:30,960
The ones that want to join me in
the Brigade Inquisitorial...

991
01:22:31,259 --> 01:22:34,705
Should repress several illicit activities.

992
01:22:46,818 --> 01:22:47,990
Watch out!

993
01:22:48,116 --> 01:22:49,224
Please

994
01:23:47,331 --> 01:23:48,343
Harry.

995
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,948
You did all you could.

996
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:59,157
Nobody could go against the
old hag.

997
01:23:59,158 --> 01:24:01,231
Even Dumbledore didn't see it coming

998
01:24:02,157 --> 01:24:04,269
Harry, if it's anyone's faults it's ours

999
01:24:04,642 --> 01:24:06,338
Yea you would say that.

1000
01:24:06,697 --> 01:24:08,106
But I agreed.

1001
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:12,639
I tried so hard to help but managed
to make things worse.

1002
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,100
Well It don't matter anymore.

1003
01:24:18,529 --> 01:24:22,414
Because I don't want to play
anymore i cared too much.

1004
01:24:23,047 --> 01:24:25,217
The more you care the more you lose.

1005
01:24:25,724 --> 01:24:28,070
- Maybe this is better.
- Then what?

1006
01:24:31,122 --> 01:24:32,478
It goes alone.

1007
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:40,209
Hagrid.

1008
01:24:43,047 --> 01:24:45,027
what is he doing?
where are you taking us?

1009
01:24:45,803 --> 01:24:47,973
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

1010
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:59,127
I never seen the centaurs so worried

1011
01:24:59,522 --> 01:25:01,512
They're dangerous enough
when they sit tight

1012
01:25:02,882 --> 01:25:05,584
If the ministry restricts
their territories once more...

1013
01:25:05,618 --> 01:25:08,021
they're going to have a full uprising
on there hands.

1014
01:25:08,022 --> 01:25:09,424
Hagrid, what's going on?

1015
01:25:09,545 --> 01:25:12,178
I'm sorry to be so mysterious

1016
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:14,112
I won't be bothering
you at all with that...

1017
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:16,118
With Dumbledore gone...

1018
01:25:17,433 --> 01:25:20,363
And getting the sack any day now

1019
01:25:20,762 --> 01:25:23,913
Well I just couldn't leave
without telling somebody about it

1020
01:25:27,182 --> 01:25:28,456
Grope!

1021
01:25:31,278 --> 01:25:33,099
Down here, you great baboon

1022
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,356
Grope.

1023
01:25:41,786 --> 01:25:43,348
I brought you some company.

1024
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:57,308
I couldn't just leave him because...

1025
01:25:57,891 --> 01:25:59,488
because he is my brother.

1026
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:00,750
Wow!

1027
01:26:00,954 --> 01:26:02,522
Half brother realy

1028
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,598
He is completely harmless as i said

1029
01:26:06,655 --> 01:26:08,110
I thought it to him!

1030
01:26:09,326 --> 01:26:12,006
Grope that's not polite - Please do something

1031
01:26:12,007 --> 01:26:14,071
We talked about this,
you don't just grab?

1032
01:26:14,295 --> 01:26:16,410
She's your new friend,
Hermione

1033
01:26:16,779 --> 01:26:17,817
Grope!

1034
01:26:22,077 --> 01:26:23,227
Grope!

1035
01:26:25,488 --> 01:26:27,374
Put me down

1036
01:26:31,927 --> 01:26:33,037
Now!

1037
01:26:44,425 --> 01:26:45,711
You're allright?

1038
01:26:47,545 --> 01:26:51,395
Fine, he just has a firm hand, that's all

1039
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:53,859
I think you've got an admirer

1040
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,743
You just stay away from her, all right?

1041
01:27:28,436 --> 01:27:30,358
He gets his own food and all

1042
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:35,146
It's company he needs when I'm gone

1043
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:38,181
You'll look after him, wont you?

1044
01:27:39,209 --> 01:27:41,470
I'm the only family he's got.

1045
01:27:53,238 --> 01:27:55,026
Feeling sentimental?

1046
01:27:58,135 --> 01:28:01,192
That's privat

1047
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:05,004
Not to me and not to the dark lord
if you don't improve

1048
01:28:06,496 --> 01:28:09,813
Every memory he has access to
is what he wants and he'll use it

1049
01:28:09,814 --> 01:28:14,965
As a weapon against you, you wont
last 2 seconds if he invates your mind

1050
01:28:16,365 --> 01:28:18,130
Youre just like your father.

1051
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,642
Lazy, arrogant

1052
01:28:20,643 --> 01:28:22,627
Don't say a word against my father

1053
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,225
- You're weak!
- I'm not weak!

1054
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,516
Then prove it

1055
01:28:25,763 --> 01:28:29,808
Control your emotions,
discipline your mind

1056
01:28:33,472 --> 01:28:34,714
Legilimens.

1057
01:28:41,686 --> 01:28:42,722
Harry.

1058
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:43,863
Sirius!

1059
01:28:45,152 --> 01:28:46,395
Touching.

1060
01:28:46,828 --> 01:28:47,978
Stop it.

1061
01:28:48,955 --> 01:28:51,104
Is this what you call, control?

1062
01:28:51,538 --> 01:28:53,868
We've been practising for
hours, can we just rest?

1063
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:57,692
The dark lord isn't resting

1064
01:28:58,286 --> 01:28:59,674
You're just like him, you're 2 of a kind

1065
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:03,394
Sentimental children,
do a little whining...

1066
01:29:03,429 --> 01:29:05,904
About how bitterly unfair
your lives have been

1067
01:29:05,939 --> 01:29:09,212
It may have escaped
unnoticed, but life isn't fair

1068
01:29:09,245 --> 01:29:13,072
Your pleased father knew that
in fact he frequently...

1069
01:29:13,073 --> 01:29:16,500
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1070
01:29:17,346 --> 01:29:18,691
- Legil...
- I protect!

1071
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:25,574
Let's go, Rabicho.

1072
01:29:25,575 --> 01:29:26,577
Snape!

1073
01:29:26,855 --> 01:29:28,177
Expelliarmus.

1074
01:29:28,178 --> 01:29:30,096
- Good, Tiago.
- Good, Tiago, continues!

1075
01:29:30,097 --> 01:29:31,008
Father.

1076
01:29:31,009 --> 01:29:32,072
Offside.

1077
01:29:32,073 --> 01:29:34,365
- Snotty!
- Snotty!

1078
01:29:34,366 --> 01:29:35,414
Right.

1079
01:29:35,449 --> 01:29:37,732
Who it wants to see me take
the pants of the Snotty.

1080
01:29:39,952 --> 01:29:41,101
Enough!

1081
01:29:42,987 --> 01:29:44,139
Enough!

1082
01:29:52,748 --> 01:29:55,362
Your lesson has gone to an end

1083
01:29:55,429 --> 01:29:56,641
It's not...

1084
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,230
Get out!

1085
01:30:16,882 --> 01:30:19,011
- What is your name?
- Michael.

1086
01:30:19,019 --> 01:30:20,712
Your hand is going to be good.

1087
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:22,981
The ink is not as bad as it seems.

1088
01:30:23,223 --> 01:30:25,603
See? it is already vanishing.

1089
01:30:26,022 --> 01:30:27,751
Hardly can see ours

1090
01:30:28,153 --> 01:30:30,277
And the pain stops after a time.

1091
01:30:35,077 --> 01:30:37,369
As I told you once before Mr. Potter,

1092
01:30:38,173 --> 01:30:40,921
Naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1093
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:45,901
You know Jorge...

1094
01:30:46,063 --> 01:30:49,545
I've always thought a
picture outside the world

1095
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,513
Fred, I think exactly the same

1096
01:30:53,846 --> 01:30:55,430
"OWL Examinations"

1097
01:30:57,376 --> 01:30:59,289
REGULATION 572 OF THE MAGIC
USE. ONLY NAVY BLUE INK

1098
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:15,568
There it goes!

1099
01:32:40,617 --> 01:32:42,188
I'm ready when you are

1100
01:34:03,222 --> 01:34:05,910
I need that prophecy.

1101
01:34:06,226 --> 01:34:08,284
You're gonna've to kill me

1102
01:34:09,637 --> 01:34:10,562
I will

1103
01:34:10,563 --> 01:34:12,999
But 1st you have to help me

1104
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:31,720
Sirius.

1105
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:34,275
Harry, are you sure? - I saw it

1106
01:34:34,357 --> 01:34:35,926
It was like with Mr. Weasley.

1107
01:34:35,927 --> 01:34:38,102
It's the same door I've
been dreaming about...

1108
01:34:38,137 --> 01:34:39,869
I just couldn't remember
where I've seen it before

1109
01:34:39,870 --> 01:34:42,375
Sirius said Voldermort
asked for something

1110
01:34:42,379 --> 01:34:44,068
Something he didn't know how to ask

1111
01:34:44,069 --> 01:34:47,092
- And it is in the Mysteries Department.
- Harry, please listen.

1112
01:34:48,945 --> 01:34:51,087
What if Voldermort made you see this?

1113
01:34:52,105 --> 01:34:52,755
He's using Sirius because
he's trying to get you

1114
01:34:54,778 --> 01:34:58,301
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?

1115
01:34:58,904 --> 01:35:01,583
Hermione, he's the only
family I've got left

1116
01:35:05,052 --> 01:35:06,348
what we will do?

1117
01:35:07,133 --> 01:35:08,931
We will use Flu's Chain.

1118
01:35:08,932 --> 01:35:11,166
But Umbridge is watching
all the chimneys.

1119
01:35:11,218 --> 01:35:12,425
Not all.

1120
01:35:15,325 --> 01:35:16,637
It's unlocked.

1121
01:35:27,554 --> 01:35:29,376
Warn the others

1122
01:35:29,456 --> 01:35:30,902
You pirou? We go with you.

1123
01:35:30,903 --> 01:35:32,358
It's to dangerous.

1124
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:36,976
When are you gonna get it through
your head?

1125
01:35:36,977 --> 01:35:39,389
I Bet you are.

1126
01:35:40,114 --> 01:35:42,494
Potter's trying to
help the Weasley girl.

1127
01:35:46,272 --> 01:35:49,089
You were going to
Dumbledore, weren't you?

1128
01:35:49,090 --> 01:35:50,235
Liar!

1129
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,665
You sent for me director?

1130
01:35:52,666 --> 01:35:53,912
Snape, yes.

1131
01:35:53,913 --> 01:35:57,189
The time has come for him to answers
whether he wants to or not.

1132
01:35:57,611 --> 01:35:59,169
You bring the serum of truth?

1133
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:02,706
I'm afraid you've used i all up
on the rest of students.

1134
01:36:02,707 --> 01:36:04,619
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1135
01:36:09,204 --> 01:36:11,016
Unless you wish to poison
him, I assure you...

1136
01:36:11,017 --> 01:36:14,245
I would have the greatest
sympathy if you did.

1137
01:36:15,559 --> 01:36:17,147
I can't help you.

1138
01:36:19,895 --> 01:36:21,661
He caught Petfoot.

1139
01:36:22,653 --> 01:36:25,502
He has Petfoot at the
place where he's hiding.

1140
01:36:26,535 --> 01:36:27,917
Petfoot? Who is Petfoot?

1141
01:36:27,918 --> 01:36:29,772
What is it? What is he
talking about, Snape?

1142
01:36:36,716 --> 01:36:38,063
Nore do i.

1143
01:36:42,878 --> 01:36:43,993
Very well

1144
01:36:45,481 --> 01:36:47,150
Oh, you got no choice, Potter.

1145
01:36:48,182 --> 01:36:50,813
As this is an issue
of Ministry Security,

1146
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:55,260
you leave me with no alternative.

1147
01:36:56,638 --> 01:36:58,896
The Cruciatas Curse will
be used on your tongue.

1148
01:36:58,931 --> 01:37:00,138
That's illegal.

1149
01:37:00,139 --> 01:37:03,454
What Fudge doesn't know won't hurt him.

1150
01:37:10,515 --> 01:37:11,784
Tell her Harry!

1151
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:14,673
tell me the what?

1152
01:37:16,067 --> 01:37:20,027
Well, if you're not telling
her where it is, I will.

1153
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:22,525
Where what is?

1154
01:37:24,191 --> 01:37:25,732
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1155
01:37:31,233 --> 01:37:33,733
- How much further?
- Not far

1156
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:38,806
Had to be, so students
wouldn't find it in anyway.

1157
01:37:43,249 --> 01:37:45,927
- what you doing?
- Improvising.

1158
01:37:54,931 --> 01:37:56,061
Well?

1159
01:37:57,609 --> 01:37:59,147
Where is this weapon?

1160
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,124
There is no weapon, is there?

1161
01:38:09,453 --> 01:38:11,149
You tried to trick me

1162
01:38:15,635 --> 01:38:17,734
Just you know...

1163
01:38:18,609 --> 01:38:22,150
I hate children.

1164
01:38:35,714 --> 01:38:37,669
You have no Business here, Centaur

1165
01:38:37,687 --> 01:38:39,399
This is a Ministry matter.

1166
01:38:42,696 --> 01:38:45,802
Lower your weapons, I warn you.

1167
01:38:45,987 --> 01:38:49,956
Under the law, as creatures
of mere human intelligence...

1168
01:38:51,544 --> 01:38:54,967
How dare you, filthy crossbreed

1169
01:38:55,386 --> 01:38:56,920
Incarcerous!

1170
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:11,016
Please Stop, please

1171
01:39:11,017 --> 01:39:12,302
Please

1172
01:39:12,337 --> 01:39:13,573
Not enough!

1173
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,012
I will have order!

1174
01:39:30,927 --> 01:39:33,213
Stop, it is not his fault!

1175
01:39:33,802 --> 01:39:35,591
He don't understand.

1176
01:39:42,161 --> 01:39:43,659
Potter, do something

1177
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:45,635
Talk for them who I
did not do for hardly!

1178
01:39:45,637 --> 01:39:49,345
I'm sorry, Professor.
I must not tell lies.

1179
01:39:49,346 --> 01:39:50,707
what are doing?

1180
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:54,961
I am Under-Secretary Dolores Umbridge.

1181
01:39:54,996 --> 01:39:56,863
Let me go

1182
01:39:59,832 --> 01:40:01,040
Thanks, Grope.

1183
01:40:01,832 --> 01:40:04,385
Hermione, Hermione, Sirius.

1184
01:40:12,005 --> 01:40:13,557
How did you get away?

1185
01:40:13,558 --> 01:40:15,542
The puking pastille. It wasn't pretty.

1186
01:40:15,872 --> 01:40:18,070
I told them I was hungry
and wanted some sweets.

1187
01:40:18,104 --> 01:40:20,712
Of course they tell me to bug off.

1188
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:22,656
Very smart, Rony.

1189
01:40:23,634 --> 01:40:24,737
- Sometimes I am.
- It was brilliant!

1190
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:28,116
He was brilliant. So,
how're we getting to London?

1191
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:32,289
Look, it's not I don't
appreciate everything you've done.

1192
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:35,521
But, I got you into
enough trouble as it is.

1193
01:40:38,518 --> 01:40:39,180
Dumbledore's army is supposed
to be doing something real.

1194
01:40:39,595 --> 01:40:41,389
Or were they just words for you?

1195
01:40:43,567 --> 01:40:46,082
Maybe you don't have to
do this all by yourself.

1196
01:40:49,593 --> 01:40:51,411
So how are we going to get to London?

1197
01:40:52,937 --> 01:40:54,478
Flying it is clear.

1198
01:41:45,128 --> 01:41:47,288
Mysteries department.

1199
01:41:55,784 --> 01:41:57,884
This is it.

1200
01:42:49,255 --> 01:42:53,684
92, 93, 94, 95.

1201
01:43:08,092 --> 01:43:09,473
It should be here.

1202
01:43:10,086 --> 01:43:11,238
Harry.

1203
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:14,763
This has your name on it.

1204
01:43:39,167 --> 01:43:43,671
The one with the power marches
to vanish the Dark Lord.

1205
01:43:44,349 --> 01:43:47,153
And the Dark Lord shall
name him the same.

1206
01:43:47,154 --> 01:43:50,052
But he'll show him the
power of the Dark Lord.

1207
01:43:55,195 --> 01:43:59,613
Neither one could live
or the other one survives.

1208
01:44:00,821 --> 01:44:01,889
Harry!

1209
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:12,451
Where is Sirius?

1210
01:44:12,641 --> 01:44:14,935
You better wish you could
tell the difference...

1211
01:44:15,272 --> 01:44:21,995
between dreams... and reality.

1212
01:44:24,013 --> 01:44:28,208
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.

1213
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:31,146
Now give me to Prophecy.

1214
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:33,034
If you're ready to toss, I'll break it.

1215
01:44:35,933 --> 01:44:37,787
He knows how to play.

1216
01:44:38,129 --> 01:44:42,528
Itty bitty baby... Potter.

1217
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:45,662
It is Belatrix Lestrange.

1218
01:44:45,985 --> 01:44:47,577
It is Neville Longbottom, he?

1219
01:44:48,255 --> 01:44:51,895
- How will be their parents?
- Better now that will be avenged.

1220
01:44:54,065 --> 01:44:58,842
Everybody just calm down, can we?

1221
01:45:00,538 --> 01:45:03,195
All we want is that prophecy.

1222
01:45:03,196 --> 01:45:05,588
Why did Voldermort made
me to come and get this?

1223
01:45:05,589 --> 01:45:07,322
You dare speak his name.

1224
01:45:08,413 --> 01:45:10,224
You filthy halfbreed.

1225
01:45:10,225 --> 01:45:13,873
It's all right. He's
just a curious child.

1226
01:45:14,672 --> 01:45:19,653
Prophecy can only be retrieved
by those who know it.

1227
01:45:20,111 --> 01:45:22,372
Which is lucky for you, really.

1228
01:45:26,595 --> 01:45:28,620
Already we asked these questions

1229
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:33,631
What was the riesen of the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1230
01:45:34,742 --> 01:45:39,940
Why he was unable to kill
you when you're just infant?

1231
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:46,605
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1232
01:45:47,785 --> 01:45:51,942
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.

1233
01:45:53,227 --> 01:45:57,076
All you have to do is give it to me.

1234
01:45:57,996 --> 01:46:00,230
I can show you everything.

1235
01:46:07,621 --> 01:46:09,455
I've waited 14 years.

1236
01:46:10,034 --> 01:46:11,323
I know.

1237
01:46:12,353 --> 01:46:14,151
I think I can wait a little more.

1238
01:46:14,152 --> 01:46:15,330
Now!

1239
01:46:15,331 --> 01:46:16,525
- Estupefaça!
- Estupefaça!

1240
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:33,733
*

1241
01:46:39,851 --> 01:46:41,626
Petrificus Totalus.

1242
01:46:41,821 --> 01:46:43,142
Very good, Neville.

1243
01:46:51,974 --> 01:46:53,168
Estupefaça!

1244
01:46:54,934 --> 01:46:56,791
- Estupefaça!
- Estupefaça!

1245
01:47:06,956 --> 01:47:08,208
Estupefaça!

1246
01:47:16,219 --> 01:47:17,572
Reducto!

1247
01:47:33,566 --> 01:47:35,326
We will come back for the door!

1248
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:09,810
Mysteries department.

1249
01:48:10,301 --> 01:48:12,185
They chose the right name, it?

1250
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:18,953
Voices...

1251
01:48:20,058 --> 01:48:21,562
They understand what they are telling?

1252
01:48:23,544 --> 01:48:27,857
No one's heard any voices,
Harry. Let's get out of here.

1253
01:48:28,273 --> 01:48:29,874
I also hear them

1254
01:48:33,069 --> 01:48:35,435
Harry, that's just an empty walkway.

1255
01:48:38,095 --> 01:48:39,367
Please, Harry!

1256
01:48:40,165 --> 01:48:41,558
Get behind me!

1257
01:49:25,898 --> 01:49:28,039
Did you actually believe...

1258
01:49:28,568 --> 01:49:32,177
that you're brave enough and..

1259
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:38,633
You children stand a chance against us?

1260
01:49:42,965 --> 01:49:46,435
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1261
01:49:49,179 --> 01:49:52,608
Give me the Prophecy now.

1262
01:49:53,602 --> 01:49:57,318
Or watch your friends... die!

1263
01:50:10,162 --> 01:50:13,090
Do not give it to him, Harry!

1264
01:50:35,725 --> 01:50:37,875
Get away from my Godson.

1265
01:51:07,547 --> 01:51:10,571
Listen to me, you just
get everyone out of here.

1266
01:51:10,605 --> 01:51:12,605
Do what? No. I'm going to stay with you.

1267
01:51:12,606 --> 01:51:14,862
Harry, you turned out beautifully.

1268
01:51:15,693 --> 01:51:17,487
Lets take care of it for now.

1269
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,840
Expelliarmus!

1270
01:51:46,151 --> 01:51:47,374
Very good, Tiago!

1271
01:51:54,551 --> 01:51:55,857
Avra Kadavra!

1272
01:52:40,988 --> 01:52:43,338
I killed Sirius Black!

1273
01:52:44,549 --> 01:52:45,758
Did you come to catch me

1274
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:46,996
Crucio!

1275
01:52:58,495 --> 01:53:00,784
You want me, Harry.

1276
01:53:01,723 --> 01:53:05,666
She killed him. She deserves it.

1277
01:53:09,165 --> 01:53:11,480
You know the sorcery, Harry.

1278
01:53:23,193 --> 01:53:24,293
Do!

1279
01:53:32,396 --> 01:53:34,432
So weak.

1280
01:53:41,883 --> 01:53:44,412
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, Tom.

1281
01:53:45,028 --> 01:53:47,199
aurores are already on way.

1282
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:49,208
When they arrive, I
already will have party.

1283
01:53:49,388 --> 01:53:50,655
And you...

1284
01:53:52,575 --> 01:53:54,000
I will be dead.

1285
01:56:04,738 --> 01:56:06,416
You lost, gaffer.

1286
01:56:24,261 --> 01:56:26,176
Harry.

1287
01:56:27,997 --> 01:56:29,303
So weak.

1288
01:56:30,155 --> 01:56:32,007
So vulnerable.

1289
01:56:36,671 --> 01:56:38,918
Look at me.

1290
01:56:40,324 --> 01:56:42,367
Harry, it isn't who you were like.

1291
01:56:44,022 --> 01:56:46,886
It's who you are not.

1292
01:56:50,230 --> 01:56:52,209
Harry.

1293
01:57:23,913 --> 01:57:25,658
You're the one who's weak.

1294
01:57:26,112 --> 01:57:29,591
You can't understand love or friendship.

1295
01:57:32,446 --> 01:57:34,518
I feel sorry for you.

1296
01:57:58,556 --> 01:58:01,186
You are a fool, Harry Potter.

1297
01:58:03,002 --> 01:58:06,193
And now you will lose everything.

1298
01:58:21,374 --> 01:58:23,595
He's back.

1299
01:58:35,701 --> 01:58:39,391
"Dumbledore, Potter Vindicated"

1300
01:58:40,351 --> 01:58:44,366
"Umbridge Suspended
Pending Investigation"

1301
01:58:49,797 --> 01:58:53,179
Hogwarts Headmaster Reinstated

1302
01:59:28,032 --> 01:59:32,200
I know how you feel, Harry.
No you don't

1303
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:38,965
It's my fault.
No the fault is mine

1304
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:42,554
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1305
01:59:43,055 --> 01:59:46,483
before Voldermort made
a connection between you.

1306
01:59:47,654 --> 01:59:50,231
I thought making a distance
for myself from you,

1307
01:59:50,526 --> 01:59:55,859
like I had all year, he'll be less tempted,
and therefor you be more protected

1308
01:59:58,854 --> 02:00:01,021
The Prophecy said:

1309
02:00:02,718 --> 02:00:05,661
Neither one could live
or the other one survives.

1310
02:00:07,712 --> 02:00:13,265
It means, one of us i's gonna
kill the other at the end.

1311
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:16,679
Yes.

1312
02:00:17,306 --> 02:00:18,946
why didn't he tell me

1313
02:00:19,399 --> 02:00:22,280
The same reason why
you tryed to save Sirius.

1314
02:00:22,315 --> 02:00:24,682
Same as your friends helping to
save you.

1315
02:00:26,224 --> 02:00:28,924
After all these years,
after all you've suffered,

1316
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:30,712
I didn't wanna cause you anymore pain.

1317
02:00:33,964 --> 02:00:35,898
I worry too much about you.

1318
02:01:00,114 --> 02:01:01,915
Why aren't you at the party? *****

1319
02:01:02,446 --> 02:01:04,248
I lost all my things.

1320
02:01:04,615 --> 02:01:07,149
Probably people have been hiding them.

1321
02:01:07,150 --> 02:01:08,360
That is horrible.

1322
02:01:08,361 --> 02:01:09,633
It's only a joke.

1323
02:01:10,207 --> 02:01:13,031
But since this is the last night,
I really do need them back.

1324
02:01:13,669 --> 02:01:15,420
You want me to help search?

1325
02:01:18,904 --> 02:01:21,316
I'm sorry about your Godfather, Harry.

1326
02:01:28,709 --> 02:01:30,918
You sure you don't
want any help looking?

1327
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:32,317
All right

1328
02:01:32,653 --> 02:01:35,107
Anyway, my mom always said...

1329
02:01:35,108 --> 02:01:38,521
Things we lose have a way
coming back to us in the end.

1330
02:01:41,981 --> 02:01:44,463
Not always in the way we expect.

1331
02:01:46,498 --> 02:01:48,419
I think I am going to eat pudding.

1332
02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:24,143
I've been thinking about
what Dumbledore said to me.

1333
02:02:25,746 --> 02:02:26,873
What's that?

1334
02:02:27,790 --> 02:02:30,182
The thing about fighting battles,

1335
02:02:30,686 --> 02:02:33,228
We've got one thing
Voldermort doesn't have.

1336
02:02:33,931 --> 02:02:34,973
Yea?

1337
02:02:37,242 --> 02:02:40,004
Something worth fighting for.
