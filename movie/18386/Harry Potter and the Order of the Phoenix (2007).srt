1
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,473
<i>I don 't know about you,</i>
<i>it's just too hot today, isn 't it?</i>

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,792
<i>And it's going to get even worse.</i>
<i>Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius...</i>

3
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,509
<i>... that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,</i>
<i>tomorrow, maybe even hitting 1 00.</i>

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,240
<i>So, please, remember to cover up</i>
<i>and stay cool...</i>

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,119
<i>... with the hottest hits on your FM dial.</i>

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,919
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,676
Come on, Iove, off you get.

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,836
-Do we have to?
-Yes, we do.

9
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,238
I'II make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,152
He squeaIed Iike a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,710
Yeah, briIIiant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,632
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,038
Beat up another 1 0-year-oId?

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,589
-This one deserved it.
-Yeah.

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,233
-Five against one, very brave.
-WeII, you're one to taIk.

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,428
Moaning in your sIeep every night?
At Ieast I'm not afraid of my piIIow.

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,239
''Don't kiII Cedric. ''

18
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,232
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,354
-Shut up.
-''He's going to kiII me, Mum. ''

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,910
Where is your mum?

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,234
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,352
She dead?

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,072
Is she dead?

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,834
Is she a dead Pott--?

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,198
-DudIey.
-DudIey, Iet's go.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,752
-What's going on?
-What are you doing?

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,753
-I'm not doing anything.
-We're getting out of here, DudIey.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,399
Come on, DudIey, hurry up.

29
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,557
DudIey, run.

30
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,079
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

31
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,438
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,151
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,715
They might come back.

34
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,793
Dementors in LittIe Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,748
-WhoIe worId's gone topsy-turvy.
-I don't understand. How do you know--?

36
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,036
DumbIedore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,431
DumbIedore asked you?
You know DumbIedore?

38
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,275
After You-Know-Who
kiIIed that poor Diggory boy Iast year. . .

39
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,000
. . .did you expect him to Iet you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,720
Good Lord, boy.
They toId me you were inteIIigent.

41
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,872
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,511
Expect someone wiII be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't Ieave the house.

43
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,835
<i>It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.</i>

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,036
<i>There's sweat. There's stifling.</i>

45
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,031
Diddykins?

46
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,271
Is that you?

47
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,352
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,429
We're going to have to
take him to a hospitaI.

49
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,636
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,552
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,400
You've finaIIy done it.
You've finaIIy driven him Ioopy.

52
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,279
v ernon, don't say that.

53
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,592
WeII, just Iook at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,831
I've reached my Iimit, do you hear?

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,675
This is the Iast I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,031
-Dear Mr. Potter.
-What?

57
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,228
The Ministry has received inteIIigence
that at 6:23 this evening. . .

58
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,951
. . .you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a MuggIe.

59
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,116
As a cIear vioIation. . .

60
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,193
. . .of the Decree for the ReasonabIe
Restriction of Underage Sorcery. . .

61
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,396
. . .you are hereby expeIIed. . .

62
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,110
. . .from Hogwarts SchooI
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,032
Hoping you are weII, MafaIda Hopkirk.

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,230
Justice.

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,070
He's not very weII.

66
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,838
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,998
Very cIean, these MuggIes.

68
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,113
-Tonks, for God's sake.
-UnnaturaI.

69
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,399
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,752
-What are you doing here?
-Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,114
But where are we going?
The Ietter said I've been expeIIed.

72
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,589
You haven't been. Not yet.
KingsIey, you take point.

73
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,749
But the Ietter said--

74
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,798
DumbIedore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expuIsion. . .

75
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,030
-. . .pending a formaI hearing.
-A hearing?

76
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,431
Don't worry. We'II expIain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,795
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,635
Don't caII me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,719
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is kiIIed.

80
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,431
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,799
Come on.

82
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,318
In you go, son.

83
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,233
There've been no sightings.

84
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,038
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,953
He aImost kiIIed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough<i>. . . .</i>

86
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,874
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important. . . .

87
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,389
We must trust DumbIedore on this.

88
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,792
Was he abIe to protect Harry Iast year?
Tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,032
CorneIius Fudge is a poIitician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,237
-His instinct wouId be to ignore it--
-Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,632
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,635
-Harry.
-Mrs. WeasIey.

93
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,589
Heavens, you're aII right.

94
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,509
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner wiII wait
untiI after the meeting's finished.

95
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,595
Nope. No time to expIain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the Ieft.

96
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,359
Yeah.

97
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,514
MudbIood, werewoIves,
traitors, thieves.

98
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,356
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they Iet into her house. . .

99
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,715
. . .what wouId she say to oId Kreacher?

100
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,598
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,074
-<i>Freaks.</i>
-There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,511
<i>Scum of the earth.</i>
<i>Not like it was in the days of my fathers.</i>

103
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,194
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,479
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,835
Are you aII right? We overheard them
taIking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,719
-You must teII us everything.
-Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,919
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,150
I've Iooked it up.
They simpIy can't expeI you.

109
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,914
-It's compIeteIy unfair.
-Yeah.

110
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,914
There's a Iot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,597
So, what is this pIace?

112
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,354
-It's headquarters.
-Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,553
It's a secret society.

114
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,154
DumbIedore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,788
CouIdn't have put any of this
in a Ietter, I suppose?

116
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,556
I've gone aII summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,590
We wanted to write, mate.
ReaIIy, we did.

118
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,749
-OnIy. . . .
-OnIy what?

119
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,992
OnIy DumbIedore made us swear
not to teII you anything.

120
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,358
DumbIedore said that?

121
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,719
But why wouId he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I couId heIp.

122
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,757
I'm the one
who saw VoIdemort return. . .

123
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,639
. . .the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get kiIIed.

124
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,916
-Harry.
-Thought we heard your duIcet tones.

125
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,959
-Don't bottIe it up, though. Let it out.
-If you're aII done shouting<i>. . . .</i>

126
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,509
Do you wanna hear something
a IittIe more interesting?

127
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,997
<i>If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.</i>
<i>If it wasn 't for Harry...</i>

128
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,116
<i>... we wouldn 't even know</i>
<i>Voldemort was back.</i>

129
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,793
<i>He's not a child, Molly.</i>

130
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,235
<i>But he's not an adult either.</i>

131
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,318
<i>-He's not James, Sirius.</i>
<i>-Well, he's not your son.</i>

132
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,550
<i>He's as good as.</i>

133
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,558
<i>-Who else has he got?</i>
-Hey, Ginny.

134
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,029
<i>-He's got me.</i>
<i>-How touchingly paternal, Black.</i>

135
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,192
<i>Perhaps Potter will grow up</i>
<i>to be a felon, just like his godfather.</i>

136
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,032
<i>Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.</i>

137
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,191
-Snape's part of the Order?
-Git.

138
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,112
<i>--about your supposed reformation.</i>

139
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,919
<i>-I know better.</i>
<i>-So why don 't you tell him?</i>

140
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,718
-Get off it.
-Quick.

141
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,438
-Get it up.
-Crookshanks.

142
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,910
-Stop it.
-Get off, you bIoody cat.

143
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,230
-Crookshanks. Leave it aIone.
-Get it up.

144
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,635
-Hermione, I hate your cat.
-Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,400
WeII, we'II be eating
down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,510
Just because you're aIIowed
to use magic now. . .

147
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,592
. . .does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,273
Hi, Mum.

149
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,878
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,554
You sure you're aII right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,790
Harry Potter.

152
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,638
Sirius.

153
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,310
This is very, very pecuIiar.

154
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,995
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,470
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,636
Show him. He'II find out soon enough.

157
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,478
He's been attacking DumbIedore as weII.

158
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,030
Fudge is using aII his power, incIuding
his infIuence at the <i>Daily Prophet...</i>

159
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,238
. . .to smear anyone who cIaims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,628
Why?

161
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,677
He thinks DumbIedore's after his job.

162
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,876
No one in their right mind
couId beIieve that--

163
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,793
ExactIy the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,394
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,309
Now, fear makes peopIe
do terribIe things, Harry.

166
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,835
The Iast time
VoIdemort gained power. . .

167
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,197
. . .he aImost destroyed
everything we hoId most dear.

168
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,114
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister wiII do aImost anything. . .

169
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,078
. . .to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,791
We think VoIdemort
wants to buiId up his army again.

171
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,440
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,991
And not just witches and wizards,
but aII manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,439
He's been recruiting heaviIy, and we've
been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,949
But gathering foIIowers
isn't the onIy thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,512
We beIieve. . .

176
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,317
. . .VoIdemort may be after something.

177
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,549
Sirius.

178
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,793
Something he didn't have Iast time.

179
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,156
You mean Iike a weapon?

180
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,199
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,079
You say more and you might as weII
induct him into the Order.

182
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,869
Good. I want to join. If v oIdemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,637
<i>Harry.</i>

184
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,950
<i>You are hereby expelled.</i>

185
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,793
<i>Before the entire Wizengamot.</i>

186
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,478
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,835
Ingenious, these MuggIes.

188
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,072
Here we are.

189
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,078
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. ShouId be fun.

190
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,912
Right. Good.
I'II just get my MuggIe money.

191
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,078
TerribIe. Lost a Iot of GaIIeons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,391
<i>Daily Prophet</i>, Iadies and gentIemen.
Anybody for <i>Daily Prophet?</i>

193
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,438
DumbIedore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,193
-Morning, Arthur.
-Morning, Bob.

195
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,233
InterdepartmentaI memos.

196
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,188
We used to use owIs.
Mess was unbeIievabIe.

197
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,396
MerIin's beard. Thank you, KingsIey.

198
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,312
They've changed the time
of your hearing.

199
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,799
When is it?

200
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,997
In five minutes.

201
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,432
<i>Department of Mysteries.</i>

202
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,839
And I'm confident, minister,
that you wiII do the right thing.

203
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,036
Yes, but we must be--

204
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,156
Remember, during the hearing,
speak onIy when you're spoken to.

205
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,710
Keep caIm.
You've done nothing wrong.

206
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,151
As the MuggIes say, truth wiII out.

207
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,914
Yes?

208
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,270
I'm not aIIowed in, I'm afraid.

209
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,512
Good Iuck, Harry.

210
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,709
DiscipIinary hearing
of the 1 2th of August. . .

211
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,713
. . .into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter. . .

212
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,350
. . .resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
LittIe Whinging, Surrey.

213
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,478
Interrogators: CorneIius OswaId Fudge,
Minister of Mag--

214
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,392
Witness for the defense.

215
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,597
AIbus PercivaI WuIfric. . .

216
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,196
. . .Brian DumbIedore.

217
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,631
You got our message
that the time and pIace of the hearing. . .

218
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,234
-. . .had been changed, did you?
-I must have missed it.

219
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,188
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours earIy.

220
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,189
The charges?

221
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,749
The charges against the accused
are as foIIows:

222
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,512
''That he did knowingIy<i>. . .</i>

223
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,070
. . .and in fuII awareness
of the iIIegaIity of his actions. . .

224
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,118
. . .produce a Patronus Charm. . .

225
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,397
<i>. . .</i>in the presence of a MuggIe. ''

226
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,711
-Do you deny producing said Patronus?
-No, but--

227
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,190
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside schooI. . .

228
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,113
-. . .whiIe under the age of 1 7?
-Yes, I was, but--

229
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,511
Witches and wizards
of the Wizengamot--

230
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,796
I was onIy doing it
because of the Dementors.

231
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,998
Dementors?

232
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,192
In LittIe Whinging?

233
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,590
That's quite cIever.

234
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,797
MuggIes can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

235
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,076
-HighIy convenient.
-I'm not Iying.

236
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,708
-There were two of them, if I hadn't--
-Enough.

237
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,919
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure
wouId be a very weII-rehearsed story. . .

238
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,392
. . .but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event--

239
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,951
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

240
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,118
PIease describe the attack.

241
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,518
What did they Iook Iike?

242
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,279
WeII, one of them was very Iarge
and the other rather skinny.

243
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,039
Not the boys. The Dementors.

244
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,715
Oh, right, right. WeII, big.

245
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,277
CIoaked. Then everything went coId. . .

246
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,156
. . .as though aII the happiness
had gone from the worId.

247
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,189
Now, Iook here. Dementors don't just
wander into a MuggIe suburb. . .

248
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,830
. . .and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomicaI.

249
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,672
I don't think anyone wouId beIieve<i>. . .</i>

250
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,752
. . .the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

251
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,913
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

252
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,359
Dementors are, after aII, under
the controI of the Ministry of Magic.

253
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,559
And it's so siIIy of me, but it sounded
for a moment as though. . .

254
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,554
. . .you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

255
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,393
That wouId be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary. . .

256
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,553
<i>. . .</i>which is why I'm sure the Ministry
wiII be mounting a fuII-scaIe inquiry. . .

257
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,951
. . .into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban. . .

258
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,351
. . .and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

259
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,316
Of course, there is someone. . .

260
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,154
. . .who might be behind the attack.

261
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,477
CorneIius, I impIore you to see reason.

262
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,997
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertibIe.

263
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,833
He is not back.

264
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,596
In the matter of Harry Potter. . .

265
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,469
. . .the Iaw cIearIy states. . .

266
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,918
. . .that magic may be used before
MuggIes in Iife-threatening situations.

267
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,878
Laws can be changed if necessary,
DumbIedore.

268
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,077
CIearIy. Has it become practice
to hoId a fuII criminaI triaI. . .

269
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,993
. . .to deaI with a simpIe matter
of underage magic?

270
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,476
Those in favor of conviction?

271
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,675
Those in favor
of cIearing the accused of aII charges?

272
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,350
CIeared of aII charges.

273
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,952
Professor.

274
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,318
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

275
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,755
You'II bIow the entire operation.

276
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,314
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you. . . .

277
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,994
I had to see you off, didn't I?

278
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,109
What's Iife without a IittIe risk?

279
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,550
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

280
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,119
Don't worry about me.

281
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,310
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

282
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,392
OriginaI Order of the Phoenix.

283
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,558
MarIene McKinnon.

284
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,188
She was kiIIed
two weeks after this was taken.

285
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,597
VoIdemort wiped out her entire famiIy.

286
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,718
Frank and AIice Longbottom.

287
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,313
NeviIIe's parents.

288
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,995
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

289
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,235
It's been 1 4 years.

290
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,079
And stiII a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

291
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,120
Do you reaIIy think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

292
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,592
It feeIs Iike it did before.

293
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,358
You keep it.

294
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,038
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

295
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,912
I'II see you at the train.

296
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,036
Bye-bye, darIing.

297
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,313
I Iove you.

298
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,951
HoId my hand, Iovey.

299
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,395
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

300
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,788
Bye.

301
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,078
I'm surprised the Ministry's
stiII Ietting you waIk around free.

302
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,673
Better enjoy it whiIe you can.

303
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,991
I expect there's a ceII in Azkaban
with your name on it.

304
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,268
-What'd I teII you? CompIete nutter.
-Just stay away from me!

305
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,192
It's onIy MaIfoy.

306
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,752
What'd you expect?

307
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,035
Hi, guys.

308
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,792
-Hey, NeviIIe.
-Hey there, NeviIIe.

309
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,799
What is it?

310
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,997
-What's what?
-That. PuIIing the carriage.

311
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,030
Nothing's puIIing the carriage, Harry.

312
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,756
It's puIIing itseIf, Iike aIways.

313
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,956
You're not going mad.

314
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,590
I can see them too.

315
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,268
You're just as sane as I am.

316
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,876
Everyone, this is Loony Love--

317
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,391
Luna Lovegood.

318
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,390
What an interesting neckIace.

319
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,990
It's a charm, actuaIIy.

320
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,833
Keeps away the NargIes.

321
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,913
Hungry.

322
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,437
I hope there's pudding.

323
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,836
-What's a NargIe?
-No idea.

324
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,598
Good evening, chiIdren.

325
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,434
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

326
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,512
We're pIeased to weIcome back
Professor GrubbIy-PIank. . .

327
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,148
<i>. . .</i>who'II be taking
Care of MagicaI Creatures. . .

328
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,630
. . .whiIe Professor Hagrid
is on temporary Ieave.

329
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,274
We aIso wish to weIcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. . .

330
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,477
. . .Professor DoIores Umbridge.

331
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,355
And I'm sure you'II aII join me
in wishing the professor good Iuck.

332
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,910
Now, as usuaI, our caretaker, Mr. FiIch,
has asked me to remind you--

333
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,154
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.
www.myvideo.tk

334
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,792
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of weIcome.

335
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,635
And how IoveIy to see aII your bright. . .

336
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,519
. . .happy faces smiIing up at me.

337
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,829
I'm sure we're aII going
to be very good friends.

338
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,150
-That's IikeIy.
-That's IikeIy.

339
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,713
The Ministry of Magic
has aIways considered. . .

340
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,273
. . .the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vitaI importance.

341
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,795
AIthough each headmaster. . .

342
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,590
. . .has brought something new
to this historic schooI. . .

343
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,996
. . .progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

344
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,355
Let us preserve
what must be preserved. . .

345
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,876
. . .perfect what can be perfected. . .

346
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:03,388
. . .and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

347
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,119
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That reaIIy was most iIIuminating.

348
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,432
-IIIuminating? What a Ioad of waffIe.
-What's it mean?

349
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,230
Magic is forbidden in the corridors. . . .

350
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,836
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

351
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,472
Dean, Seamus.

352
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,796
-Good hoIiday?
-AII right.

353
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,276
Better than Seamus', anyway.

354
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,790
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

355
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,111
-Why not?
-Let me see. Because of you.

356
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,751
The <i>Daily Prophet's</i> been saying a Iot
of things about you and DumbIedore.

357
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,194
What, your mum beIieves them?

358
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,191
Nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

359
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,318
I guess you shouId read the <i>Prophet,</i>
then, Iike your stupid mother.

360
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,836
-Don't taIk about my mother.
-I'II have a go at anyone caIIing me a Iiar.

361
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,389
-What's going on?
-He's mad, is what's going on.

362
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,518
Do you beIieve the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

363
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,272
Yeah. I do.

364
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,117
Has anyone eIse
got a probIem with Harry?

365
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,469
-You aII right?
-Fine.

366
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,313
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

367
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,475
-But he'II come through, you'II see.
-I said, I'm fine, Ron.

368
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,232
Right. I'II just Ieave you
to your thoughts, then.

369
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,469
<i>Harry.</i>

370
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,350
Bring it over here. Over here.

371
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,993
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

372
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,353
Good morning, chiIdren.

373
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,229
Ordinary Wizarding LeveI examinations.

374
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,868
O-W-Ls.

375
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,431
More commonIy known as OWLs.

376
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,592
Study hard and you wiII be rewarded.

377
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,948
FaiI to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

378
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,155
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingIy uneven.

379
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,390
But you'II be pIeased to know,
from now on. . .

380
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,916
. . .you wiII be foIIowing a carefuIIy
structured, Ministry-approved. . .

381
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,640
. . .course of defensive magic. Yes?

382
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,434
There's nothing in here
about using defensive speIIs?

383
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,079
Using speIIs?

384
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,550
WeII, I can't imagine why you wouId
need to use speIIs in my cIassroom.

385
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,713
We're not gonna use magic?

386
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,670
You'II be Iearning about defensive speIIs
in a secure, risk-free way.

387
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,479
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

388
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,473
Students wiII raise their hands
when they speak in my cIass.

389
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,269
It is the view of the Ministry. . .

390
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,079
. . .that a theoreticaI knowIedge
wiII be sufficient. . .

391
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,117
. . .to get you through
your examinations. . .

392
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,635
. . .which, after aII,
is what schooI is aII about.

393
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,473
And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?

394
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,596
There is nothing out there, dear.

395
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,638
Who do you imagine
wants to attack chiIdren Iike yourseIf?

396
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,951
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord VoIdemort.

397
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,512
Now, Iet me make this quite pIain.

398
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,439
You have been toId. . .

399
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,754
. . .that a certain dark wizard
is at Iarge once again.

400
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,835
-This is a Iie.
-It's not a Iie. I saw him. I fought him.

401
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,558
Detention, Mr. Potter.

402
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,790
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

403
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,269
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

404
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,510
It was murder. VoIdemort kiIIed him.

405
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,113
Enough!

406
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,352
Enough.

407
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,672
See me Iater, Mr. Potter. My office.

408
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,549
Come in.

409
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,431
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

410
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,268
Sit.

411
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,394
You're going to be doing some Iines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

412
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,357
No, not with your quiII.

413
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,632
Going to be using
a rather speciaI one of mine.

414
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,913
Now. . .

415
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,472
. . .I want you to write,
''I must not teII Iies. ''

416
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,277
How many times?

417
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,191
WeII, Iet's say for as Iong as it takes
for the message to sink in.

418
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,712
You haven't given me any ink.

419
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,313
Oh, you won't need any ink.

420
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,873
Yes?

421
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,151
-Nothing.
-That's right.

422
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,828
Because you know, deep down. . .

423
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,991
. . .you deserve to be punished.

424
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,190
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

425
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,798
Go on.

426
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,635
-Skiving Snackboxes.
-Sweets that make you iII.

427
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,358
Get out of cIass whenever you Iike.

428
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,115
Obtain hours of pIeasure
from unprofitabIe boredom.

429
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,354
Care for another?

430
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,954
-I'm not asking you to write aII of it.
-PIease.

431
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,953
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

432
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,158
I'II do the introduction. That's aII.

433
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,915
Hermione, you're honestIy the most
wonderfuI person I've ever met.

434
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,153
-And if I'm ever rude to you again<i>. . . .</i>
-I'II know you've gone back to normaI.

435
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,991
What's wrong with your hand?

436
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,919
Nothing.

437
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,951
The other hand.

438
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,112
-You've got to teII DumbIedore.
-No.

439
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,396
DumbIedore's got enough
on his mind right now.

440
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,596
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

441
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,069
BIoody heII, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

442
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,028
-If the parents knew about this. . . .
-I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

443
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,075
Harry, you've got to report this.

444
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,630
-It's perfectIy simpIe. You're being--
-No, it's not.

445
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,519
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simpIe.

446
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,476
You don't understand.

447
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,791
Then heIp us to.

448
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,717
<i>Dear Padfoot...</i>

449
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,878
<i>...I hope you're all right.</i>

450
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,477
<i>It's starting to get colder here.</i>
<i>Winter is definitely on the way.</i>

451
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,551
<i>In spite of being back at Hogwarts,</i>
<i>I feel more alone than ever.</i>

452
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,557
<i>I know you, of all people,</i>
<i>will understand.</i>

453
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,356
HeIIo, Harry Potter.

454
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,317
-Your feet. Aren't they coId?
-Bit.

455
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,079
UnfortunateIy, aII my shoes
have mysteriousIy disappeared.

456
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,558
I suspect NargIes are behind it.

457
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,110
-What are they?
-They're caIIed ThestraIs.

458
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,629
They're quite gentIe, reaIIy, but peopIe
avoid them because they're a bit<i>. . . .</i>

459
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,998
Different.

460
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,275
But why can't the others see them?

461
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,796
They can onIy be seen
by peopIe who've seen death.

462
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,354
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

463
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,078
My mum.

464
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,310
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did Iike to experiment. . .

465
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,631
. . .and one day,
one of her speIIs went badIy wrong.

466
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,075
-I was 9.
-I'm sorry.

467
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,756
Yes, it was rather horribIe.

468
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,040
I do feeI very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

469
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,720
We both beIieve you, by the way.

470
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,518
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him. . .

471
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,672
. . .and the Ministry and the <i>Prophet</i>
are conspiring against you.

472
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,992
Thanks. It seems you're about
the onIy ones that do.

473
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,434
I don't think that's true.

474
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,712
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feeI.

475
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,598
What do you mean?

476
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,997
WeII, if I were You-Know-Who. . .

477
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,876
<i>. . .</i>I'd want you to feeI cut off
from everyone eIse. . .

478
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,634
<i>. . .</i>because if it's just you aIone<i>. . .</i>

479
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,670
<i>. . .</i>you're not as much of a threat.

480
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,151
-Do you ever stop eating?
-What? I'm hungry.

481
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,389
Harry.

482
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,354
Can I join you?

483
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,192
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactIy are you insinuating?

484
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,999
I am mereIy requesting
that when it comes to my students. . .

485
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,278
. . .you conform to the prescribed
discipIinary practices.

486
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,032
So siIIy of me, but it sounds. . .

487
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,159
<i>. . .</i>as if you're questioning my authority
in my own cIassroom. . .

488
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,594
. . .Minerva.

489
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,038
Not at aII, DoIores,
mereIy your medievaI methods.

490
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,669
I am sorry, dear.

491
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,037
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry. . .

492
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,192
. . .and by extension,
the minister himseIf.

493
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,873
I am a toIerant woman. . .

494
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,909
. . .but the one thing
I wiII not stand for is disIoyaIty.

495
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,318
DisIoyaIty.

496
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,748
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

497
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,276
CorneIius wiII want
to take immediate action.

498
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,031
What's happened to DumbIedore?

499
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,634
<i>Having already revolutionized...</i>

500
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,360
<i>... the teaching</i>
<i>of Defense Against the Dark Arts...</i>

501
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,316
<i>...Dolores Umbridge will,</i>
<i>as high inquisitor, have powers...</i>

502
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,713
. . .to address the seriousIy faIIing
standards at Hogwarts SchooI.

503
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,230
Just one question, dear.

504
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,439
You've been in this post
how Iong, exactIy?

505
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,829
You appIied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

506
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,911
Yes.

507
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,834
But you were unsuccessfuI?

508
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,309
ObviousIy.

509
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,636
CouId you pIease predict something
for me?

510
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,435
I'm sorry?

511
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,596
Move those mouths.

512
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,438
One teensy IittIe prophecy?

513
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,479
Pity.

514
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,309
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

515
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,596
Yes, I do. Something dark.

516
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,197
You are in grave danger.

517
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,272
LoveIy.

518
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,110
Cho. What's going on?

519
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,510
It's Professor TreIawney.

520
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,476
Sixteen years I've Iived
and taught here.

521
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,438
Hogwarts is my home.

522
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,077
You can't do this.

523
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,630
ActuaIIy, I can.

524
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,479
Something you'd Iike to say?

525
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,200
Oh, there are severaI things
I wouId Iike to say.

526
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,233
There. . . .

527
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,071
Professor McGonagaII, might I ask you
to escort SybiI back inside?

528
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,675
SybiI, dear. This way.

529
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,273
Thank you.

530
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,279
DumbIedore, may I remind you
that under the terms. . .

531
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,557
. . .of EducationaI Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister--

532
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,757
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

533
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,356
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

534
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,432
That power remains
with the headmaster.

535
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,554
For now.

536
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,631
Don't you aII have studying to do?

537
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,915
Professor.

538
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,749
Professor?

539
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,873
Professor DumbIedore. Professor!

540
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,076
Professor DumbIedore.

541
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,356
<i>That foul, evil, old gargoyle.</i>

542
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,950
We're not Iearning
how to defend ourseIves.

543
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,680
We're not Iearning
how to pass our OWLs.

544
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,996
She's taking over the entire schooI.

545
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,631
<i>Security has been and will remain</i>
<i>the Ministry's top priority.</i>

546
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,519
<i>Furthermore,</i>
<i>we have convincing evidence...</i>

547
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,433
<i>... that these disappearances</i>
<i>are the work...</i>

548
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,831
<i>...of notorious</i>
<i>mass murderer Sirius Black.</i>

549
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,073
Harry.

550
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,918
Sirius.

551
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,200
-What are you doing here?
-Answering your Ietter.

552
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,158
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

553
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,151
Training you to kiII haIf-breeds?

554
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,198
-She's not Ietting us use magic at aII.
-WeII, I'm not surprised.

555
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,399
The Iatest inteIIigence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

556
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,549
Combat?

557
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,838
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

558
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,319
That's exactIy what he thinks.

559
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,268
That DumbIedore is assembIing
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

560
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,957
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

561
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,636
The others wouIdn't want me
teIIing you this, Harry. . .

562
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,839
<i>. . .</i>but things aren't going at aII weII
with the Order.

563
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,560
Fudge is bIocking the truth
at every turn. . .

564
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,554
. . .and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

565
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,517
VoIdemort is on the move.

566
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,233
WeII, what can we do?

567
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,199
Someone's coming.

568
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,476
I'm sorry I can't be of more heIp.

569
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,430
But for now, at Ieast,
it Iooks Iike you're on your own.

570
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,710
He reaIIy is out there, isn't he?

571
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,040
We've got to be abIe
to defend ourseIves.

572
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,195
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us
how, we need someone who wiII.

573
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,590
<i>Harry.</i>

574
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,075
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

575
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,389
I'm a nutter, remember?

576
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,872
Look on the bright side: you can't be
any worse than oId toad face.

577
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,430
-Thanks, Ron.
-I'm here for you, mate.

578
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,150
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

579
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,356
Just a coupIe of peopIe.

580
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,559
LoveIy spot.

581
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,156
Thought it wouId be safer
off the beaten track.

582
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,390
Matey, come back here.

583
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,595
Hi.

584
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,753
So you aII know why we're here.

585
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,114
We need a teacher.

586
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,830
A proper teacher.

587
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,157
One who's had experience defending
themseIves against the Dark Arts.

588
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,992
-Why?
-Why?

589
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,151
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

590
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,833
-So he says.
-So DumbIedore says.

591
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,036
So DumbIedore says because he says.

592
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,475
The point is, where's the proof?

593
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,712
If Potter couId teII us more
about how Diggory got kiIIed. . . .

594
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,309
I'm not gonna taIk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, cIear out now.

595
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,756
Come on, Hermione. They're here
because they think I'm some freak.

596
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,434
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

597
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,993
Yes.

598
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,799
I've seen it.

00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,996
BIimey, Harry.
I didn't know you couId do that.

in DumbIedore's office.

601
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,954
It's true.

602
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,759
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

603
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,673
Last year, he reaIIy did fight off
You-Know-Who in the fIesh.

604
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,114
Wait.

605
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,117
Look, it aII sounds great
when you say it Iike that. . .

606
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,716
. . .but the truth is,
most of that was just Iuck.

607
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,555
I didn't know what I was doing
haIf the time. I nearIy aIways had heIp.

608
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,076
-He's just being modest.
-No, Hermione, I'm not.

609
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,991
Facing this stuff in reaI Iife
is not Iike schooI.

In schooI, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

You don't know what that's Iike.

615

You're right, Harry, we don't.

616
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,671
That's why we need your heIp.

617
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,638

Who cares?

626

I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the ruIes?

Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

628

01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,833
-Sir.
-Phineas.

749
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,195
You must go to your portrait
at GrimmauId PIace.

750
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,874
TeII them that Arthur WeasIey
is graveIy injured. . .

751
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,033
. . .and his chiIdren wiII be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

752
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,158
They've got him, AIbus. It was cIose,
but they think he'II make it.

753
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,709
What's more,
the Dark Lord faiIed to acquire it.

754
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,711
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to--

755
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,029
Look at me!

756
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,396
What's happening to me?

757
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,757
You wished to see me, headmaster?

758
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,630
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even tiII the morning.

759
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,798
Otherwise, we'II aII be vuInerabIe.

760
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,918
It appears there's a connection<i>. . .</i>

761
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,310
<i>. . .</i>between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

762
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,473
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, uncIear.

763
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,712
Pray he remains ignorant.

764
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,031
You mean, if he knows about it, then. . .

765
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,678
-<i>. . .</i>he'II be abIe to read my mind?
-Read it, controI it. . .

766
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,637
. . .unhinge it.

767
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,031
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pIeasure<i>. . .</i>

768
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,350
. . .to invade the minds of his victims. . .

769
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,956
. . .creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

770
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,636
OnIy after extracting the Iast exquisite
ounce of agony. . .

771
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,918
. . .onIy when he had them IiteraIIy

. . .kiII them.

773
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,509

. . .wiII heIp shieId you
from access or infIuence.

775
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,751
In these Iessons, I wiII attempt
to penetrate your mind.

776
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,278
You wiII attempt to resist.

777
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,959
Prepare yourseIf.

778
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,749
<i>Legilimens.</i>

779
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,996
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

780
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,398
<i>Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.</i>

781
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,120
Here we go.

782
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,350
Daddy's back.

783
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,870
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

784
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,238
-And a nice big box for Ron.
-Big box for you. And. . . .

785
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,036
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

786
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,395
-I want to see your faces.
-Yes.

787
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,869
-Try it on.
-Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

788
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,158
-Just what he wanted, actuaIIy.
-Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

789
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,073
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's cIear this away.

790
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,151
Oh, Harry, Harry.

791
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,151
There you are.

792
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,872
-Happy Christmas.
-Thank you.

793
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,192
-LoveIy to have you with us.
-Thank you.

794
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,271
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

795
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,078
-Thank you.
-Has everybody got?

796
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,559
Fred? George?

797
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,154
-Hermione.
-A Christmas toast.

798
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,117
To Mr. Harry Potter. . .

799
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,799
. . .without whom I wouId not be here.

800
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,470
-Harry.
-Harry.

801
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,834
Harry.

802
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,268
That is deIicious.
I shaII be needing some more of that.

803
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,715
Daddy, don't forget Iast Christmas.

804
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,239
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, RonaId.

805
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,392
I Iook Iike a bIoody idiot, that's why.

806
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,312
No more than usuaI, Ron.

807
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,272
I don't know why<i>. . . .</i>

808
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,431
Nasty brat, standing there
as boId as brass.

809
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,151
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

810
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,198
Friend of MudbIoods
and bIood-traitors aIike.

811
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,114
-If my poor mistress onIy knew. . . .
-Kreacher!

812
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,999
That's enough of your biIe.
Away with you!

813
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,071
Of course, master.

814
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,711
Kreacher Iives to serve
the nobIe house of BIack.

815
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,757
Sorry about that.

816
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,835
He never was very pIeasant,
even when I was a boy.

817
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,151
Not to me, anyway.

818
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,837
What, you grew up here?

819
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,150
This is my parents' house.

820
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,155
I offered it to DumbIedore
as headquarters for the Order.

821
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,391
About the onIy usefuI thing
I've been abIe to do.

822
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,995
This is the BIack famiIy tree.

823
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,916
My deranged cousin.

824
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,674
I hated the Iot of them.

825
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:57,356
My parents with their pure-bIood mania.

826
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:04,069
My mother did that after I ran away.

827
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,117
Charming woman.

828
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,912
I was 1 6.

829
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,073
Where did you go?

830
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,274
Round your dad's.

831
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,154
I was aIways weIcome at the Potters' .

832
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,639
I see him so much in you, Harry.

833
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,356
You are so very much aIike.

834
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,151
I'm not so sure.

835
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,559
Sirius, when I was. . . .

836
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:38,592
When I saw Mr. WeasIey attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

837
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,153
I was the snake.

838
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,793
And afterwards,
in DumbIedore's office<i>. . .</i>

839
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,999
. . .there was a moment
when I wanted to--

840
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,673
This connection
between me and VoIdemort.

841
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,756
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more Iike him?

842
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,750
I just feeI so angry aII the time.

843
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:11,277
And what if, after everything
that I've been through<i>. . .</i>

844
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,876
<i>. . .</i>something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

845
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,517
I want you to Iisten to me
very carefuIIy, Harry.

846
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,518
You're not a bad person.

847
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,472
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

848
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,149
You understand?

849
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,995
Besides, the worId isn't spIit
into good peopIe and Death Eaters.

850
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:42,438
We've aII got both Iight and dark
inside of us.

851
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,277
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

852
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,355
That's who we reaIIy are.

853
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,632
Harry, time to go.

854
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,438
When aII this is over,
we'II be a proper famiIy.

855
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,113
You'II see.

856
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,519
Come on.

857
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,555
ReaIIy?

858
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,234
Harry. Harry.

859
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,231
Hagrid's back.

860
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,832
I'm sorry.

861
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,517
I wiII say this one Iast time.

862
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,075
I'm ordering you to teII me
where you've been.

863
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,118
I toId you. I've been away
for me heaIth.

864
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,433
-Your heaIth?
-Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

865
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,230
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficuIt to come by.

866
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,589
If I were you,
I shouIdn't get too used to being back.

867
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,911
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at aII.

868
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,038
This is top-secret, right?

869
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,195
DumbIedore sent me
to parIey with the giants.

870
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,793
Giants?

871
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,949
You found them?

872
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,829
WeII, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectIy honest. They're so big, see?

873
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,592
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

874
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,320
But I wasn't the onIy one
that was trying to win them over.

875
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,831
-Death Eaters?
-Yes.

876
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,477
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

877
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,235
-Did they?
-I gave them DumbIedore's message.

878
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,313
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendIy to them. I suppose.

879
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,028
And they did this to you?

880
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,392
Not exactIy, no.

881
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,634
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

882
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,076
It's changing out there.

883
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,993
Just Iike Iast time.

884
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,958
There's a storm coming, Harry.

885
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,638
We'd aII best be ready when she does.

886
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,032
<i>We have confirmed</i>
<i>that 1 0 high-security prisoners...</i>

this couId happen.

895
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,757
He's gonna get us aII kiIIed
just because he can't face the truth.

896
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,989
Harry.

897
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,471
I wanted to apoIogize.

898
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:28,033
Now even me mum says the <i>Prophet's</i>
version of things don't add up.

01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:33,877
So, what I'm reaIIy trying to say
is that I beIieve you.

900
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,078
NeviIIe?

901
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,190
Fourteen years ago. . .

902
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,433
. . .a Death Eater
named BeIIatrix Lestrange. . .

903
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,672
. . .used a Cruciatus Curse
on my parents.

904
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:08,034
She tortured them for information. . .

905
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,270
. . .but they never gave in.

906
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,269
I'm quite proud to be their son.

907
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,909
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

908
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,559
We're gonna make them proud, NeviIIe.
That's a promise.

909
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,189
Make it a powerfuI memory,
the happiest you can remember.

910
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,636
AIIow it to fiII you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

911
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,153
George, your turn now.

912
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,670
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

913
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,836
A fuII-bodied Patronus
is the most difficuIt to produce. . .

914
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,675
. . .but shieId forms can aIso be equaIIy
usefuI against a variety of opponents.

915
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,034
Wow, that was reaIIy good.

916
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,199
Fantastic, Ginny.

917
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,239
Just remember, your Patronus can onIy
protect you for as Iong as you stay focused.

918
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,595
So focus, Luna.

919
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,798
Think of the happiest thing you can.

920
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,837
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

921
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,753
-I'm trying.
-I know. It's good.

922
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,993
This is reaIIy advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so weII.

923
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,029
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

924
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,594
I'II make short work of this.

925
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,791
<i>Bombarda Maxima.</i>

926
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,639
Get them.

927
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,439
Been watching them for weeks.

928
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,477
And see, ''DumbIedore's Army'' <i>. . .</i>

929
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,429
<i>. . .</i>proof of what I've been teIIing you
right from the beginning, CorneIius.

930
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,716
AII your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who. . .

931
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,359
. . .never fooIed us for a minute.

932
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,511
We saw your Iies for what they were:

933
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,309
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize controI of the Ministry.

934
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,469
NaturaIIy.

935
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,074
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

936
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,755
Most nobIe of you, Harry, to shieId me,
but as has been pointed out. . .

937
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:55,550
. . .the parchment cIearIy says
''DumbIedore's Army,'' not ''Potter's. ''

938
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,234
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

939
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,710
And I, and I aIone,
am responsibIe for its activities.

940
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,632
Dispatch an owI to the <i>Daily Prophet.</i>

941
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,234
If we hurry, we shouId stiII make
the morning edition.

942
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,996
DawIish, ShackIeboIt,
you wiII escort DumbIedore. . .

943
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,513
. . .to Azkaban. . .

944
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:18,669
. . .to await triaI
for conspiracy and sedition.

945
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,638
I thought we might hit this IittIe snag.

946
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,070
You seem to be Iaboring
under the deIusion that I'm going to--

947
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,999
What was the phrase?

948
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,673
--come quietIy.

949
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,478
WeII, I can teII you this:

950
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,110
I have no intention
of going to Azkaban.

951
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,474
Enough of this.

952
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,995
Take him.

953
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:53,518
WeII, you may not Iike him, minister. . .

01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,431
<i>Boys and girls are not permitted</i>

Harry.

961
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,916
You did everything you couId.
No one couId win against that oId hag.

962
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,310
Even DumbIedore
didn't see this coming.

963
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,270
Harry, if it's anyone's fauIt, it's ours.

964
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,431
Yeah, we taIked you into it.

965
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,511
Yeah, but I agreed.

966
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,999
I tried so hard to heIp,
and aII it's done is make things worse.

967
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,315
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

968
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,359
Because I don't want to pIay anymore.
AII it does is make you care too much.

969
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,080
And the more you care,
the more you have to Iose.

-So maybe it's just better to<i>. . . .</i>

971
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,271
To go it aIone.

972
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,952
Hagrid.

973
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,869
Any idea where he's taking us?

974
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,998
Hagrid, why can't you just teII us?

975
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,520
I've never seen the centaurs so riIed.

976
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,114
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

977
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,270

their territory much more. . .

Brought you some company.

-Grawpy, that is not poIite.
-Hagrid, do something.

You just stay away from her, aII right?

1005
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,439
He gets his own food and aII.

1006
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,598

Sirius said VoIdemort

What if VoIdemort

I've waited 1 4 years.

1203
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,708
I know.

1204
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,798
I guess I can wait a IittIe Ionger.
Now. <i>Stupefy.</i>

1205
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:17,313
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1206
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,789
<i>Levicorpus.</i>

1207
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,996
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

1208
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:43,878
WeII done, NeviIIe.

1209
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,479
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1210
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,354
<i>-Stupefy.</i>
<i>-Stupefy.</i>

1211
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,837
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1212
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,275
<i>Reducto.</i>

1213
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:35,676
Get back to the door.

1214
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,832
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1215
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,671
The voices.

1216
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,156
Can you teII what they're saying?

1217
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:26,830
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1218
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,232
Let's get out of here.

1219
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:30,913
I hear them too.

1220
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,434
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1221
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,433
PIease, Harry.

1222
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,957
Get behind me.

1223
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,194
Did you actuaIIy beIieve. . .

1224
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:34,751
. . .or were you truIy naive enough
to think. . .

1225
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:40,275
. . .that chiIdren stood a chance
against us?

1226
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:47,235
I'II make this simpIe for you, Potter.

1227
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:53,957
Give me the prophecy now. . .

1228
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:57,954
. . .or watch your friends die.

1229
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,713
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1230
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:39,559
Get away from my godson.

1231
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:10,908
Now, Iisten to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1232
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,992
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1233
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,879
You've done beautifuIIy.

1234
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,078
Now, Iet me take it from here.

1235
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:19,229
BIack.

1236
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,554
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1237
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:47,994
Nice one, James.

1238
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,353
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1239
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:17,950
<i>No. No.</i>

1240
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,468
I kiIIed Sirius BIack.

1241
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,277
-You coming to get me?
<i>-Crucio.</i>

1242
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:01,157
<i>You've got to mean it, Harry.</i>

1243
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:04,915
<i>She killed him. She deserves it.</i>

1244
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:11,672
<i>You know the spell, Harry.</i>

1245
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,318
Do it.

1246
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:34,513
So weak.

1247
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,072
It was fooIish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1248
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:45,912
The Aurors are on their way.

1249
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:50,119
By which time I shaII be gone,
and you. . .

1250
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,596
. . .shaII be dead.

1251
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,197
You've Iost, oId man.

1252
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,509
Harry.

1253
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,913
<i>So weak.</i>

1254
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,516
<i>So vulnerable.</i>

1255
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:37,629
Look at me.

1256
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:44,113
Harry, it isn't how you are aIike.

1257
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,669
It's how you are not.

1258
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:52,833
Harry?

1259
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,319
You're the weak one<i>. . .</i>

1260
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:29,879
<i>. . .</i>and you'II never know
Iove or friendship.

1261
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:35,913
And I feeI sorry for you.

1262
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:01,350
You're a fooI, Harry Potter.

1263
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:07,195
And you wiII Iose everything.

1264
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:23,112
He's back.

1265
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,672
I know how you feeI, Harry.

1266
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:31,398
No, you don't.

1267
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,119
It's my fauIt.

1268
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:41,431
No, the fauIt is mine.

1269
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:44,072
I knew it was onIy a matter of time. . .

1270
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:47,198
. . .before VoIdemort made the connection
between you.

1271
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:52,033
I thought by distancing myseIf from you,
as I have done aII year. . .

1272
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:57,228
<i>. . .</i>he'd be Iess tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.

1273
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,117
The prophecy said:

1274
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:07,508
''Neither one can Iive
whiIe the other one survives. ''

1275
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:14,591
It means one of us is gonna
have to kiII the other, in the end.

1276
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,033
Yes.

1277
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,993
Why didn't you teII me?

1278
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:23,596
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1279
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,115
The same reason your friends saved you.

1280
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:30,276
After aII these years,
after aII you've suffered<i>. . .</i>

1281
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:33,238
<i>. . .</i>I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1282
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,676
I cared too much about you.

1283
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,750
How come you're not at the feast?

1284
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:07,277
Lost aII my possessions. ApparentIy
peopIe have been hiding them.

1285
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,429
That's awfuI.

1286
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:10,397
Oh, it's aII good fun.

1287
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,870
But as it's the Iast night,
I reaIIy do need them back.

1288
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,315
Do you want any heIp finding them?

1289
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:22,152
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1290
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,911
Are you sure you don't want
any heIp Iooking?

1291
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:32,672
That's aII right.

1292
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,910
Anyway, my mum aIways said. . .

1293
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:38,755
. . .the things we Iose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1294
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:44,997
If not aIways in the way we expect.

1295
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:49,034
Think I'II just go have some pudding.

1296
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:26,038
I've been thinking about something
DumbIedore said to me.

1297
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:27,838
What's that?

1298
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,073
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us<i>. . .</i>

1299
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:34,198
<i>. . .</i>we've got one thing
that v oIdemort doesn't have.

1300
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:35,793
Yeah?

1301
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:39,870
Something worth fighting for.
