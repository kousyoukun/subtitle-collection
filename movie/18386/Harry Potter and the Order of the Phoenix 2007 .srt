1
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:53,999
I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:58,320
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:02,030
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,749
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,633
...with the hottest hits
on your FM dial.

6
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:10,415
Come on, guys,
time to go home.

7
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:13,163
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,356
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:21,747
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.

10
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,653
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:28,203
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:30,128
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:32,556
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:35,113
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:39,727
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:44,943
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:49,745
"Don't kill Cedric. "

18
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:51,758
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:56,841
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum"

20
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:59,407
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:02,733
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,879
She dead?

23
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:07,566
Is she dead?

24
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,362
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,720
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,265
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,277
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:33,898
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:24,053
Dudley, run.

30
00:03:58,263 --> 00:03:59,604
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:29,937
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,662
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,228
They might come back.

34
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,294
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:46,252
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:48,528
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,957
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:55,796
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,512
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:01,232
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,399
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:09,041
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,340
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,543
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,533
Diddykins?

46
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,798
Is that you?

47
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,958
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,083
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:47,921
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,771
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:55,126
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,358
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:01,205
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:16,559
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:21,747
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:26,452
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,622
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:32,687
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,896
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,636
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,543
Hoping you are well,
Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,749
Justice.

65
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,602
He's not very well.

66
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,331
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:23,509
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,615
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,920
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,248
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:40,628
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:43,128
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,239
But the letter said...

74
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:47,313
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,555
...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:52,951
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:55,318
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:59,159
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:08,243
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,938
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,306
Come on.

82
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:40,823
In you go, son.

83
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,729
There've been no sightings.

84
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,558
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:48,474
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

86
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:52,411
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,922
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:10:57,084 --> 00:11:01,307
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:04,534
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

90
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,734
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:12,156
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:18,168
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,089
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,038
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:35,125
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:36,859
Yeah.

97
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:44,022
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:48,858
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:51,225
...what would she
say to old Kreacher?

100
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,090
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:09,591
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:13,018
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,701
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,987
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:27,354
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:30,234
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:34,424
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,662
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,415
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:42,422
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,109
So, what is this place?

112
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,855
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:51,058
It's a secret society.

114
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,685
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:56,309
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:59,063
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,093
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

118
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:04,274
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:07,512
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,871
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:15,225
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,277
I'm the one who
saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:20,155
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:22,423
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,485
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- Lf you're all done shouting...

126
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,044
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:33,498
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:35,637
...we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.

129
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:37,300
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,739
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,845
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:45,079
He's as good as.

133
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,064
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,564
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,694
Perhaps Potter will grow up to
be a felon, just like his godfather.

136
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,553
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,693
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,652
About your supposed reformation.

139
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,433
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,224
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,951
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,415
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:09,754
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:15,160
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:18,904
Well, we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:22,044
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,109
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,805
Hi, Mum.

149
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,401
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:32,087
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:34,327
Harry Potter.

152
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,170
Sirius.

153
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,850
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,528
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:52,991
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:57,149
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:10,005
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:16,565
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:19,733
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:21,147
Why?

161
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:23,199
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,400
No one in their right mind
could believe that...

163
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:28,317
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,901
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,847
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:37,342
The last time
Voldemort gained power...

167
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,701
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:44,638
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,614
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:53,305
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,953
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:15:57,121 --> 00:16:01,496
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,942
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:10,460
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:15,037
We believe...

176
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:17,856
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,064
Sirius.

178
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,310
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,663
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,727
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:35,581
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,389
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,149
Harry.

184
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,484
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,332
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:08,988
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,357
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:29,597
Here we are.

189
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:35,607
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,446
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:21,601
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:24,926
Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,960
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:51,710
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:55,737
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:59,703
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,938
Merlin's beard.
Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:11,328
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

199
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,503
In five minutes.

200
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,966
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:30,364
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:32,539
Yes, but we must be...

203
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:42,690
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:46,234
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:49,662
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,457
Yes?

207
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,784
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

208
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:58,046
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,249
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

210
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,234
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:10,876
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,011
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

213
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,936
Witness for the defense.

214
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,133
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,722
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:26,143
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

217
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,763
...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:32,707
But by a happy mistake,
I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:36,701
The charges?

220
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,290
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

221
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,021
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:44,603
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

223
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:47,642
...produce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:50,911
...in the presence of a Muggle. "

225
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:54,240
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

226
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:57,721
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,642
...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

228
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:04,033
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

229
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,335
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

230
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:10,525
Dementors?

231
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:12,734
In Little Whinging?

232
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:15,137
That's quite clever.

233
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

234
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:20,605
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:21:20,773 --> 00:21:23,228
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

236
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:27,423
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:31,899
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

238
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:36,476
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

239
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:42,652
Please describe the attack.

240
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:47,040
What did they look like?

241
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:52,804
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:56,544
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:21:56,709 --> 00:22:00,222
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:05,789
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:09,667
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:14,717
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:18,366
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:20,192
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:23,260
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:28,451
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

251
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:33,883
Dementors are, after all,
under the control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:38,080
And it's so silly of me,
but it sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:42,075
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:44,930
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:49,087
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:52,483
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:55,875
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

258
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,848
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:01,662
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,990
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

261
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:13,533
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:16,353
He is not back.

263
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:24,127
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,013
...the law clearly states...

265
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:31,461
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.

266
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:34,404
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

267
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:37,600
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:40,516
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

269
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,998
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:05,190
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

271
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:20,898
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:25,473
Professor.

273
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,830
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:43,268
You'll blow the entire operation.

275
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,856
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...

276
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:56,512
I had to see you off, didn't I?

277
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,637
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,077
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,647
Don't worry about me.

280
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:09,853
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:17,918
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,098
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:22,719
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,113
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:28,259
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:29,853
Neville's parents.

287
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:33,537
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

288
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,767
It's been 14 years.

289
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:42,594
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

290
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,633
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,102
It feels like it did before.

292
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:00,900
You keep it.

293
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:05,575
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

294
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:09,445
I'll see you at the train.

295
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,551
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:13,832
I love you.

297
00:26:14,568 --> 00:26:16,478
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:18,916
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

299
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,325
Bye.

300
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,624
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:05,192
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:08,517
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

303
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:14,814
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:17,733
It's only Malfoy.

305
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,293
What'd you expect?

306
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:40,578
Hi, guys.

307
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,339
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

308
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:56,320
What is it?

309
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,541
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,550
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:07,301
It's pulling itself, like always.

312
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:22,501
You're not going mad.

313
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:27,110
I can see them too.

314
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,818
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:37,409
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

316
00:28:40,107 --> 00:28:41,929
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:47,943
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,532
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:53,378
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:58,432
Hungry.

321
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,970
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:05,379
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

323
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:19,106
Good evening, children.

324
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:22,981
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:29:23,147 --> 00:29:26,049
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:28,674
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

327
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:32,159
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:36,801
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:40,005
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,878
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:49,441
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

332
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,694
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

333
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:08,326
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

334
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:13,157
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:16,041
...happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:30:16,396 --> 00:30:21,382
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:23,686
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

338
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:29,259
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:34,788
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:37,319
Although each headmaster...

341
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:42,121
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:49,509
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

343
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:53,898
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

344
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,410
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:03,909
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:14,629
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:31:14,796 --> 00:31:18,986
- Llluminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

348
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:21,766
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

349
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:25,348
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,991
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:48,325
- Good holiday?
- All right.

352
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:50,824
Better than Seamus', anyway.

353
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,314
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

354
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:57,641
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:01,290
The Daily Prophet's been saying
a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:02,730
What, your mum believes them?

357
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:04,716
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:07,844
I guess you should read the Prophet, then,
like your stupid mother.

359
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:11,362
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

360
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:13,923
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

361
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:17,061
Do you believe the rubbish he's come out
with about You-Know-Who?

362
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,790
Yeah. I do.

363
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,644
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

364
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:33,003
- You all right?
- Fine.

365
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:35,849
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

366
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:40,009
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:47,756
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

368
00:33:15,054 --> 00:33:16,003
Harry.

369
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,903
Bring it over here. Over here.

370
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:36,524
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

371
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:52,876
Good morning, children.

372
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:59,752
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

373
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,406
O- W-Ls.

374
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:06,950
More commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,119
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:15,498
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

377
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:25,703
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

378
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:27,911
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

379
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,428
...you will be following
a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...

380
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,185
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

381
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:37,959
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

382
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:39,589
Using spells?

383
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,076
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

384
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,247
We're not gonna use magic?

385
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:51,205
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

386
00:34:51,376 --> 00:34:54,027
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

387
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:57,006
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

388
00:35:00,496 --> 00:35:02,798
It is the view of the Ministry...

389
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,611
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

390
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:07,663
...to get you through your examinations...

391
00:35:07,824 --> 00:35:10,159
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

392
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,003
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?

393
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:15,110
There is nothing out there, dear.

394
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,182
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

395
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:21,483
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:36,038
Now, let me make this quite plain.

397
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:37,968
You have been told...

398
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:43,279
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

399
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:48,362
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

400
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:50,089
Detention, Mr. Potter.

401
00:35:50,257 --> 00:35:52,329
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

402
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:54,831
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

403
00:35:54,993 --> 00:35:57,065
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:58,640
Enough!

405
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:00,906
Enough.

406
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:05,197
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

407
00:36:28,945 --> 00:36:30,090
Come in.

408
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:36,976
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:36:37,585 --> 00:36:38,796
Sit.

410
00:36:46,194 --> 00:36:49,936
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

411
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:51,886
No, not with your quill.

412
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:55,180
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

413
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:01,455
Now...

414
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:08,015
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies. "

415
00:37:10,001 --> 00:37:11,823
How many times?

416
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:16,715
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

417
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:20,234
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:21,831
Oh, you won't need any ink.

419
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:12,423
Yes?

420
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:22,704
- Nothing.
- That's right.

421
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:27,367
Because you know, deep down...

422
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,514
...you deserve to be punished.

423
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,715
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:38,314
Go on.

425
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:49,166
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

426
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:50,892
Get out of class whenever you like.

427
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:54,670
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

428
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:56,912
Care for another?

429
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:59,496
- I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
- Please.

430
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:02,515
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:39:02,963 --> 00:39:04,687
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

432
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:08,463
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.

433
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:12,686
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

434
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,531
What's wrong with your hand?

435
00:39:20,052 --> 00:39:21,459
Nothing.

436
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:24,498
The other hand.

437
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:28,656
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

438
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,925
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

439
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:33,131
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

440
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:35,634
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

441
00:39:35,796 --> 00:39:39,571
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

442
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,627
Harry, you've got to report this.

443
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:48,170
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

444
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,057
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

445
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:53,994
You don't understand.

446
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,355
Then help us to.

447
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:14,257
Dear Padfoot...

448
00:40:14,773 --> 00:40:16,431
...I hope you're all right.

449
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:21,005
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

450
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,079
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

451
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:32,081
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

452
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:06,894
Hello, Harry Potter.

453
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:13,870
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.

454
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:18,603
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:22,091
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

456
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:31,662
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

457
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:37,165
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

458
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:41,550
Different.

459
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:46,802
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:50,348
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

461
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:54,894
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

462
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,622
My mum.

463
00:41:57,142 --> 00:42:01,844
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

464
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:05,169
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

465
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,635
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:42:08,182 --> 00:42:10,287
Yes, it was rather horrible.

467
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:15,571
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

468
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:20,238
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,059
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back,
and you fought him...

470
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,197
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

471
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:33,556
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

472
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,995
I don't think that's true.

473
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,270
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,129
What do you mean?

475
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:44,531
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

476
00:42:44,983 --> 00:42:48,398
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

477
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:51,185
...because if it's just you alone...

478
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,227
...you're not as much of a threat.

479
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:15,698
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

480
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:19,950
Harry.

481
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:22,897
Can I join you?

482
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,727
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

483
00:43:27,894 --> 00:43:30,545
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

484
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:34,803
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

485
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:36,560
So silly of me, but it sounds...

486
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:40,688
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

487
00:43:40,855 --> 00:43:42,132
...Minerva.

488
00:43:42,295 --> 00:43:46,572
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

489
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,207
I am sorry, dear.

490
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:52,563
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

491
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:55,727
...and by extension,
the minister himself.

492
00:43:55,895 --> 00:43:57,422
I am a tolerant woman...

493
00:43:57,592 --> 00:44:02,447
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

494
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:05,842
Disloyalty.

495
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:11,308
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

496
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,796
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

497
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:27,574
What's happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:30,191
Having already revolutionized...

499
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,913
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

500
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,836
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

501
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:44,241
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

502
00:44:51,704 --> 00:44:53,777
Just one question, dear.

503
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:57,970
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

504
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:09,392
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

505
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,469
Yes.

506
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:14,385
But you were unsuccessful?

507
00:45:15,544 --> 00:45:17,879
Obviously.

508
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:52,184
Could you please predict something
for me?

509
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:54,994
I'm sorry?

510
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:02,130
Move those mouths.

511
00:46:08,025 --> 00:46:10,992
One teensy little prophecy?

512
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:18,008
Pity.

513
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:20,855
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

514
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:23,122
Yes, I do. Something dark.

515
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:27,728
You are in grave danger.

516
00:46:29,145 --> 00:46:30,803
Lovely.

517
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:42,642
Cho. What's going on?

518
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,046
It's Professor Trelawney.

519
00:47:13,658 --> 00:47:17,007
Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.

520
00:47:17,178 --> 00:47:19,993
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:47:21,818 --> 00:47:23,641
You can't do this.

522
00:47:25,018 --> 00:47:27,189
Actually, I can.

523
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:37,015
Something you'd like to say?

524
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:39,732
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

525
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:41,776
There...

526
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:59,603
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

527
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:03,225
Sybil, dear. This way.

528
00:48:03,387 --> 00:48:04,816
Thank you.

529
00:48:05,946 --> 00:48:09,808
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

530
00:48:09,979 --> 00:48:13,110
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister...

531
00:48:13,274 --> 00:48:16,308
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

532
00:48:16,475 --> 00:48:19,890
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

533
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:22,961
That power remains
with the headmaster.

534
00:48:24,891 --> 00:48:26,101
For now.

535
00:48:32,283 --> 00:48:34,192
Don't you all have studying to do?

536
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:35,476
Professor.

537
00:48:37,243 --> 00:48:38,290
Professor?

538
00:48:38,747 --> 00:48:41,430
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

539
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:43,635
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:48:53,884 --> 00:48:55,891
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

541
00:48:56,412 --> 00:49:01,234
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:03,538
She's taking over the entire school.

543
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:08,180
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

544
00:49:08,347 --> 00:49:11,064
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

545
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:13,977
...that these disappearances
are the work...

546
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,402
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:49:18,107 --> 00:49:19,602
Harry.

548
00:49:19,836 --> 00:49:21,461
Sirius.

549
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:24,758
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

550
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:27,706
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

551
00:49:27,868 --> 00:49:29,723
Training you to kill half-breeds?

552
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,731
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

553
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:36,979
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

554
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:38,096
Combat?

555
00:49:38,588 --> 00:49:41,370
What does he think, we're forming
some sort of wizard army?

556
00:49:41,532 --> 00:49:42,874
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:49:43,036 --> 00:49:46,811
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

558
00:49:47,324 --> 00:49:50,488
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

559
00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:54,160
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

560
00:49:54,684 --> 00:49:57,401
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

561
00:49:57,564 --> 00:50:00,084
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

562
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:04,082
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

563
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,057
Voldemort is on the move.

564
00:50:08,444 --> 00:50:09,786
Well, what can we do?

565
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:11,739
Someone's coming.

566
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:14,006
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:50:14,173 --> 00:50:18,962
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

568
00:50:30,045 --> 00:50:32,282
He really is out there, isn't he?

569
00:50:34,044 --> 00:50:36,597
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

570
00:50:37,149 --> 00:50:40,761
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.

571
00:50:57,085 --> 00:50:59,157
Harry.

572
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:10,618
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

573
00:51:10,781 --> 00:51:11,959
I'm a nutter, remember?

574
00:51:12,126 --> 00:51:16,436
Look on the bright side:
You can't be any worse than old toad face.

575
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:19,986
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

576
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,714
Who's supposed to be
meeting us, then?

577
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:24,917
Just a couple of people.

578
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:31,099
Lovely spot.

579
00:51:34,654 --> 00:51:36,694
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

580
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:38,934
Matey, come back here.

581
00:51:47,038 --> 00:51:48,151
Hi.

582
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:51,324
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:52,664
We need a teacher.

584
00:51:54,302 --> 00:51:56,374
A proper teacher.

585
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,703
One who's had experience
defending themselves against the Dark Arts.

586
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,561
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:52:01,726 --> 00:52:03,701
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

588
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,365
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

589
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:07,574
So Dumbledore says because he says.

590
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:10,044
The point is, where's the proof?

591
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:14,260
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

592
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:20,858
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

593
00:52:21,022 --> 00:52:24,317
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

594
00:52:24,479 --> 00:52:26,999
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

595
00:52:30,174 --> 00:52:31,549
Yes.

596
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:34,333
I've seen it.

597
00:52:34,494 --> 00:52:36,534
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

598
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:41,143
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

599
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:42,489
It's true.

600
00:52:42,655 --> 00:52:45,305
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,242
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

602
00:52:49,406 --> 00:52:50,650
Wait.

603
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:55,669
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

604
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,254
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

605
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,097
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

606
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,612
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

607
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:13,560
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

608
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,855
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

609
00:53:18,015 --> 00:53:19,444
But out there...

610
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,195
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

611
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,904
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

612
00:53:29,568 --> 00:53:31,291
You don't know what that's like.

613
00:53:40,672 --> 00:53:42,494
You're right, Harry, we don't.

614
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:45,239
That's why we need your help.

615
00:53:45,407 --> 00:53:48,190
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

616
00:53:50,303 --> 00:53:51,416
...Voldemort...

617
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,378
He's really back.

618
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:19,385
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

619
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:20,893
...where Umbridge won't find out.

620
00:54:21,055 --> 00:54:23,128
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

621
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:26,143
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

622
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,312
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

623
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,593
Who cares?

624
00:54:30,176 --> 00:54:34,846
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

625
00:54:35,008 --> 00:54:37,179
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?

626
00:54:37,856 --> 00:54:41,369
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.

627
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:42,780
What's that?

628
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,002
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

629
00:54:49,632 --> 00:54:52,567
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

630
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:55,453
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

631
00:54:55,616 --> 00:54:59,293
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

632
00:54:59,456 --> 00:55:01,212
Will do, Harry.

633
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:13,562
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

634
00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:17,176
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

635
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:19,744
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

636
00:55:53,985 --> 00:55:58,076
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

637
00:55:58,241 --> 00:55:59,321
The what?

638
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,791
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

639
00:56:01,954 --> 00:56:05,249
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

640
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:07,962
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

641
00:56:08,129 --> 00:56:11,707
So say you really needed the toilet...

642
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:17,470
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

643
00:56:17,633 --> 00:56:22,303
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

644
00:56:32,898 --> 00:56:34,327
Expelliarmus.

645
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:40,607
I'm hopeless.

646
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:44,381
You're just flourishing your wand too much.
Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

647
00:56:47,618 --> 00:56:51,480
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

648
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,519
...to ensure maximum retention.

649
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:58,428
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

650
00:56:58,594 --> 00:57:00,537
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

651
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,897
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

652
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,205
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

653
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:21,785
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

654
00:57:28,035 --> 00:57:29,376
Stupefy!

655
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:38,338
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

656
00:57:43,491 --> 00:57:45,498
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

657
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:47,768
Thanks, Ronald.

658
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:52,443
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

659
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:55,361
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

660
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:57,817
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

661
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:05,888
Stupefy.

662
00:58:11,331 --> 00:58:13,218
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

663
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:18,011
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

664
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,585
It was completely intentional.

665
00:58:47,172 --> 00:58:49,987
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

666
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,992
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

667
00:58:56,548 --> 00:58:58,435
Expelliarmus.

668
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,395
Very good. Keep your concentration.

669
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:05,848
Great.

670
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,603
A little higher.

671
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:19,456
I'm okay. I'm okay.

672
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:39,261
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

673
00:59:40,772 --> 00:59:44,002
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

674
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:46,914
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.

675
00:59:47,076 --> 00:59:48,637
Diminuendo.

676
00:59:54,308 --> 00:59:58,432
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

677
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:00,702
Believing in yourself.

678
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:02,908
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:00:03,076 --> 01:00:04,570
Think of it this way.

680
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:08,570
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

681
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,643
...as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.

682
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:15,620
If they can do it, why not us?

683
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:27,073
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

684
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:30,466
Expelliarmus.

685
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:34,490
Expelliarmus.

686
01:00:39,813 --> 01:00:41,057
Reducto.

687
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:56,891
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

688
01:00:57,061 --> 01:00:59,330
Expelliarmus.

689
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:05,052
Expelliarmus.

690
01:01:08,742 --> 01:01:12,003
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:01:13,573 --> 01:01:15,613
So that's it for this lesson.

692
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:19,043
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

693
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:22,331
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

694
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:25,730
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

695
01:01:30,341 --> 01:01:31,716
Well done, mate.

696
01:01:31,878 --> 01:01:33,252
Thanks.

697
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:40,963
See you after Christmas.

698
01:01:50,022 --> 01:01:51,997
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,936
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

700
01:01:57,638 --> 01:01:59,907
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

701
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,627
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

702
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,579
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

703
01:02:04,742 --> 01:02:07,231
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

704
01:02:07,398 --> 01:02:09,700
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

705
01:02:09,862 --> 01:02:12,415
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

706
01:02:12,582 --> 01:02:15,004
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

707
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:30,049
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

708
01:02:30,214 --> 01:02:32,483
Yeah. I'm okay.

709
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:35,842
Anyway, it's worth it.

710
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:44,001
It's just, learning all this...

711
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:47,864
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

712
01:02:48,025 --> 01:02:50,643
Cedric did know this stuff.

713
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:53,494
He was really good.

714
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,723
It's just, Voldemort was better.

715
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,804
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

716
01:03:04,025 --> 01:03:06,807
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

717
01:03:15,578 --> 01:03:17,171
Mistletoe.

718
01:03:20,538 --> 01:03:22,393
Probably full of Nargles, though.

719
01:03:23,418 --> 01:03:25,043
What are Nargles?

720
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:27,381
No idea.

721
01:03:48,507 --> 01:03:50,612
<i>Well, how was it?</i>

722
01:03:51,354 --> 01:03:53,045
Wet.

723
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:55,125
I mean, she was sort of crying.

724
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:57,370
That bad at it, are you?

725
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:00,149
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

726
01:04:02,874 --> 01:04:04,947
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

727
01:04:05,115 --> 01:04:07,286
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

728
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:11,448
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

729
01:04:15,676 --> 01:04:18,992
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

730
01:04:19,164 --> 01:04:22,098
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

731
01:04:22,268 --> 01:04:25,367
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

732
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:29,110
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

733
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:34,387
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

734
01:04:34,556 --> 01:04:37,654
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

735
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:54,419
<i>Harry.</i>

736
01:05:02,843 --> 01:05:05,778
<i>Voldemort may be after something.</i>

737
01:05:06,427 --> 01:05:09,296
<i>Something he didn't have last time.</i>

738
01:05:10,108 --> 01:05:11,318
<i>Harry.</i>

739
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:14,102
<i>Harry.</i>

740
01:05:43,933 --> 01:05:47,194
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

741
01:05:47,356 --> 01:05:48,785
...or looking down at the scene?

742
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:52,092
Neither. It was like I...

743
01:05:52,636 --> 01:05:54,643
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

744
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:57,049
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

745
01:05:57,213 --> 01:05:59,514
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

746
01:05:59,676 --> 01:06:01,171
- Sir.
- Phineas.

747
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,544
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

748
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,229
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

749
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:10,391
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

750
01:06:10,558 --> 01:06:13,493
They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he'll make it.

751
01:06:13,661 --> 01:06:16,083
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

752
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:18,076
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

753
01:06:18,238 --> 01:06:19,383
Look at me!

754
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:27,768
What's happening to me?

755
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:37,115
You wished to see me, headmaster?

756
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:41,980
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

757
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:45,148
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

758
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,253
It appears there's a connection...

759
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:53,659
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

760
01:06:53,822 --> 01:06:57,815
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

761
01:06:58,174 --> 01:07:01,076
Pray he remains ignorant.

762
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,378
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

763
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:09,054
...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

764
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:11,004
...unhinge it.

765
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:14,396
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

766
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,698
...to invade the minds of his victims...

767
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:20,311
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

768
01:07:21,408 --> 01:07:26,012
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

769
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:30,267
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

770
01:07:30,432 --> 01:07:31,609
...kill them.

771
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:34,878
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

772
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,389
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

773
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,132
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

774
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,647
You will attempt to resist.

775
01:07:46,912 --> 01:07:48,319
Prepare yourself.

776
01:07:50,944 --> 01:07:52,122
<i>Legilimens.</i>

777
01:07:59,904 --> 01:08:03,353
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

778
01:08:28,194 --> 01:08:29,754
<i>Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.</i>

779
01:08:30,914 --> 01:08:33,467
Here we go.

780
01:08:33,633 --> 01:08:35,706
Daddy's back.

781
01:08:38,754 --> 01:08:42,234
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

782
01:08:42,402 --> 01:08:46,592
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

783
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:51,386
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

784
01:08:51,553 --> 01:08:53,757
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

785
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:56,224
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

786
01:08:56,386 --> 01:09:00,510
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

787
01:09:00,674 --> 01:09:03,425
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

788
01:09:03,587 --> 01:09:05,529
Oh, Harry, Harry.

789
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:07,521
There you are.

790
01:09:08,483 --> 01:09:10,239
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

791
01:09:10,787 --> 01:09:12,576
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

792
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:14,626
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

793
01:09:14,787 --> 01:09:16,446
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

794
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:17,921
Fred? George?

795
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:20,504
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

796
01:09:20,675 --> 01:09:22,464
To Mr. Harry Potter...

797
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,176
...without whom I would not be here.

798
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:31,839
- Harry.
- Harry.

799
01:09:32,003 --> 01:09:33,181
Harry.

800
01:09:34,147 --> 01:09:36,635
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

801
01:09:36,803 --> 01:09:39,073
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

802
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:42,589
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

803
01:09:44,003 --> 01:09:45,759
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

804
01:09:45,923 --> 01:09:47,679
No more than usual, Ron.

805
01:09:47,876 --> 01:09:49,632
I don't know why...

806
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:59,804
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

807
01:09:59,972 --> 01:10:04,511
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

808
01:10:04,676 --> 01:10:07,546
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

809
01:10:07,973 --> 01:10:10,460
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

810
01:10:10,628 --> 01:10:13,345
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

811
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:15,418
Of course, master.

812
01:10:15,589 --> 01:10:20,095
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

813
01:10:22,309 --> 01:10:24,131
Sorry about that.

814
01:10:24,677 --> 01:10:28,190
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

815
01:10:28,517 --> 01:10:30,524
Not to me, anyway.

816
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:33,188
What, you grew up here?

817
01:10:33,349 --> 01:10:35,521
This is my parents' house.

818
01:10:35,845 --> 01:10:39,522
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

819
01:10:40,613 --> 01:10:43,744
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

820
01:10:45,093 --> 01:10:47,362
This is the Black family tree.

821
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:50,269
My deranged cousin.

822
01:10:50,438 --> 01:10:53,056
I hated the lot of them.

823
01:10:53,221 --> 01:10:57,728
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

824
01:11:00,806 --> 01:11:04,450
My mother did that after I ran away.

825
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,483
Charming woman.

826
01:11:09,702 --> 01:11:11,263
I was 16.

827
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,444
Where did you go?

828
01:11:15,431 --> 01:11:16,641
Round your dad's.

829
01:11:18,086 --> 01:11:20,508
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

830
01:11:21,383 --> 01:11:24,001
I see him so much in you, Harry.

831
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:26,720
You are so very much alike.

832
01:11:27,623 --> 01:11:29,511
I'm not so sure.

833
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:31,909
Sirius, when I was...

834
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:38,974
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

835
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:41,532
I was the snake.

836
01:11:42,343 --> 01:11:45,158
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

837
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:49,345
...there was a moment
when I wanted to...

838
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:57,030
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

839
01:11:57,672 --> 01:12:01,120
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

840
01:12:02,408 --> 01:12:07,110
I just feel so angry all the time.

841
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:11,648
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

842
01:12:11,816 --> 01:12:15,232
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

843
01:12:17,768 --> 01:12:20,867
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

844
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:24,872
You're not a bad person.

845
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:29,863
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

846
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,520
You understand?

847
01:12:33,545 --> 01:12:38,367
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

848
01:12:38,537 --> 01:12:42,814
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

849
01:12:43,528 --> 01:12:46,660
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

850
01:12:48,521 --> 01:12:50,725
That's who we really are.

851
01:12:54,314 --> 01:12:56,005
Harry, time to go.

852
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:01,797
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

853
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:03,489
You'll see.

854
01:13:04,586 --> 01:13:05,895
Come on.

855
01:13:41,802 --> 01:13:42,915
Really?

856
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:45,603
Harry. Harry.

857
01:13:45,771 --> 01:13:47,626
Hagrid's back.

858
01:13:50,443 --> 01:13:52,200
I'm sorry.

859
01:14:05,835 --> 01:14:08,869
I will say this one last time.

860
01:14:09,164 --> 01:14:11,433
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

861
01:14:11,595 --> 01:14:14,498
I told you. I've been away for me health.

862
01:14:14,827 --> 01:14:18,821
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

863
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:23,625
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

864
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,969
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

865
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,271
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

866
01:14:49,453 --> 01:14:52,420
This is top-secret, right?

867
01:14:53,293 --> 01:14:55,562
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

868
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:57,154
Giants?

869
01:14:58,349 --> 01:14:59,298
You found them?

870
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:03,212
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

871
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:06,947
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

872
01:15:07,118 --> 01:15:09,704
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

873
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:12,204
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

874
01:15:12,654 --> 01:15:15,850
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

875
01:15:16,334 --> 01:15:18,603
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

876
01:15:18,766 --> 01:15:22,694
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

877
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:27,402
And they did this to you?

878
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:29,769
Not exactly, no.

879
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:33,996
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

880
01:15:47,407 --> 01:15:49,447
It's changing out there.

881
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:51,365
Just like last time.

882
01:15:52,783 --> 01:15:54,344
There's a storm coming, Harry.

883
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,990
We'd all best be ready when she does.

884
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:36,390
<i>We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...</i>

885
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,276
<i>in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.</i>

886
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:42,952
<i>And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.</i>

887
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,129
<i>We strongly suspect...</i>

888
01:16:45,937 --> 01:16:47,847
...that the breakout was engineered...

889
01:16:48,017 --> 01:16:52,043
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

890
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:56,268
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

891
01:16:57,649 --> 01:17:01,839
<i>...cousin of escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange.</i>

892
01:17:11,729 --> 01:17:13,933
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

893
01:17:14,098 --> 01:17:17,131
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

894
01:17:17,297 --> 01:17:18,377
Harry.

895
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:23,847
I wanted to apologize.

896
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:28,427
<i>Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.</i>

897
01:17:28,594 --> 01:17:34,257
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

898
01:17:40,914 --> 01:17:42,441
Neville?

899
01:17:54,515 --> 01:17:56,555
Fourteen years ago...

900
01:17:56,723 --> 01:18:00,814
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

901
01:18:00,979 --> 01:18:04,045
...used a
Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

902
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:08,392
She tortured them for information...

903
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:10,636
...but they never gave in.

904
01:18:12,243 --> 01:18:14,632
I'm quite proud to be their son.

905
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:19,281
But I'm not sure
I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.

906
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:28,940
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

907
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:36,557
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

908
01:18:36,723 --> 01:18:40,018
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

909
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,522
George, your turn now.

910
01:18:42,836 --> 01:18:45,040
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

911
01:18:45,941 --> 01:18:49,236
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

912
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:53,073
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

913
01:18:53,236 --> 01:18:54,414
Wow, that was really good.

914
01:18:55,093 --> 01:18:56,587
Fantastic, Ginny.

915
01:18:56,757 --> 01:19:00,619
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

916
01:19:00,789 --> 01:19:02,993
So focus, Luna.

917
01:19:06,549 --> 01:19:08,174
Think of the happiest thing you can.

918
01:19:08,341 --> 01:19:10,229
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

919
01:19:10,389 --> 01:19:13,138
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

920
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:17,392
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

921
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:20,402
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

922
01:20:00,535 --> 01:20:02,956
I'll make short work of this.

923
01:20:04,246 --> 01:20:06,156
<i>Bombarda Maxima.</i>

924
01:20:23,703 --> 01:20:25,012
Get them.

925
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:26,838
Been watching them for weeks.

926
01:20:26,999 --> 01:20:28,854
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...

927
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:32,817
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

928
01:20:34,135 --> 01:20:36,110
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

929
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:37,741
...never fooled us for a minute.

930
01:20:37,912 --> 01:20:39,887
We saw your lies for what they were:

931
01:20:40,056 --> 01:20:43,733
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

932
01:20:43,896 --> 01:20:44,844
Naturally.

933
01:20:45,016 --> 01:20:47,437
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

934
01:20:47,608 --> 01:20:51,121
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

935
01:20:51,288 --> 01:20:55,925
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's. "

936
01:20:56,088 --> 01:20:58,608
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

937
01:20:58,776 --> 01:21:02,093
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

938
01:21:02,264 --> 01:21:04,020
<i>Dispatch an owl to
the Daily Prophet.</i>

939
01:21:04,184 --> 01:21:06,606
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.

940
01:21:06,777 --> 01:21:11,381
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

941
01:21:11,544 --> 01:21:12,919
...to Azkaban...

942
01:21:14,105 --> 01:21:19,058
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

943
01:21:19,224 --> 01:21:22,039
I thought we might hit this little snag.

944
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,456
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to...

945
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,375
What was the phrase?

946
01:21:28,537 --> 01:21:30,064
Come quietly.

947
01:21:30,232 --> 01:21:31,858
Well, I can tell you this:

948
01:21:32,281 --> 01:21:34,485
I have no intention of
going to Azkaban.

949
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:35,860
Enough of this.

950
01:21:36,345 --> 01:21:37,393
Take him.

951
01:21:49,722 --> 01:21:53,912
Well, you may not like him, minister...

952
01:21:54,074 --> 01:21:56,114
...but you can't deny...

953
01:21:56,634 --> 01:21:59,252
...Dumbledore has got style.

954
01:22:22,363 --> 01:22:26,803
<i>Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.</i>

955
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:30,265
<i>Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...</i>

956
01:22:30,426 --> 01:22:35,249
<i>Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.</i>

957
01:22:35,419 --> 01:22:39,543
<i>Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.</i>

958
01:23:47,837 --> 01:23:49,364
Harry.

959
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:59,291
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

960
01:23:59,453 --> 01:24:01,723
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

961
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:04,662
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

962
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:06,837
Yeah, we talked you into it.

963
01:24:07,006 --> 01:24:08,893
Yeah, but I agreed.

964
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:13,399
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

965
01:24:15,357 --> 01:24:17,692
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

966
01:24:18,718 --> 01:24:22,744
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

967
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:25,463
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

968
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:28,663
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

969
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:32,669
To go it alone.

970
01:24:38,751 --> 01:24:40,344
Hagrid.

971
01:24:43,935 --> 01:24:46,270
Any idea where he's taking us?

972
01:24:46,431 --> 01:24:49,366
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

973
01:24:57,343 --> 01:24:59,896
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

974
01:25:00,064 --> 01:25:02,519
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

975
01:25:03,423 --> 01:25:05,660
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

976
01:25:05,824 --> 01:25:07,929
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

977
01:25:08,096 --> 01:25:09,689
Hagrid, what's going on?

978
01:25:09,856 --> 01:25:11,994
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

979
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:16,916
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

980
01:25:17,536 --> 01:25:20,569
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

981
01:25:20,735 --> 01:25:24,084
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

982
01:25:28,129 --> 01:25:29,689
Grawpy.

983
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:34,009
Down here, you great buffoon.

984
01:25:40,097 --> 01:25:41,722
Grawpy.

985
01:25:42,465 --> 01:25:44,090
Brought you some company.

986
01:25:55,937 --> 01:25:58,109
I couldn't just leave him, because...

987
01:25:58,274 --> 01:25:59,932
Because he's my brother.

988
01:26:00,097 --> 01:26:01,177
Blimey.

989
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:03,288
Well, half brother, really.

990
01:26:03,457 --> 01:26:08,509
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

991
01:26:10,561 --> 01:26:12,797
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

992
01:26:12,961 --> 01:26:15,263
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

993
01:26:15,425 --> 01:26:17,597
That's your new friend, Hermione.

994
01:26:17,762 --> 01:26:19,005
Grawpy.

995
01:26:23,137 --> 01:26:24,282
Grawp.

996
01:26:26,242 --> 01:26:29,177
Put me down.

997
01:26:32,706 --> 01:26:34,201
Now.

998
01:26:45,859 --> 01:26:46,906
You all right?

999
01:26:48,163 --> 01:26:49,756
Fine.

1000
01:26:50,147 --> 01:26:52,351
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1001
01:26:52,515 --> 01:26:54,817
I think you've got an admirer.

1002
01:26:57,219 --> 01:26:59,291
You just stay away from her, all right?

1003
01:27:28,196 --> 01:27:30,815
He gets his own food and all.

1004
01:27:32,036 --> 01:27:34,971
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1005
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:38,399
You will look after him, won't you?

1006
01:27:38,884 --> 01:27:41,470
I'm the only family he's got.

1007
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,289
Feeling sentimental?

1008
01:27:59,429 --> 01:28:03,106
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1009
01:28:03,397 --> 01:28:06,746
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1010
01:28:09,092 --> 01:28:12,126
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1011
01:28:12,293 --> 01:28:16,254
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1012
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:19,552
You're just like your father.

1013
01:28:19,717 --> 01:28:21,441
Lazy, arrogant.

1014
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:23,745
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1015
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,982
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1016
01:28:26,598 --> 01:28:28,453
Control your emotions.

1017
01:28:28,614 --> 01:28:31,429
Discipline your mind.

1018
01:28:34,151 --> 01:28:35,296
<i>Legilimens.</i>

1019
01:28:42,214 --> 01:28:43,262
<i>Harry.</i>

1020
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:45,089
Sirius.

1021
01:28:45,734 --> 01:28:47,011
<i>I may vomit.</i>

1022
01:28:47,302 --> 01:28:48,284
Stop it.

1023
01:28:49,382 --> 01:28:51,586
Is this what you call control?

1024
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:55,005
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1025
01:28:55,174 --> 01:28:58,436
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1026
01:29:00,007 --> 01:29:01,829
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1027
01:29:01,991 --> 01:29:05,788
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1028
01:29:05,959 --> 01:29:09,188
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

1029
01:29:09,351 --> 01:29:13,148
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1030
01:29:13,318 --> 01:29:16,220
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1031
01:29:17,223 --> 01:29:18,653
<i>- Legilimens.
- Protego.</i>

1032
01:29:24,008 --> 01:29:25,470
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1033
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,615
<i>Snape. Expelliarmus.</i>

1034
01:29:27,784 --> 01:29:29,540
Nice one, James.

1035
01:29:29,896 --> 01:29:32,099
<i>- Dad.
- Impedimenta.</i>

1036
01:29:32,263 --> 01:29:34,173
<i>Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.</i>

1037
01:29:34,344 --> 01:29:36,897
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1038
01:29:37,064 --> 01:29:39,235
<i>Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.</i>

1039
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,545
<i>Enough.</i>

1040
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:43,967
Enough.

1041
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:54,624
Your lessons are at an end.

1042
01:29:54,793 --> 01:29:55,873
I...

1043
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:59,172
Get out.

1044
01:30:15,688 --> 01:30:17,762
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1045
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:19,752
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1046
01:30:19,913 --> 01:30:22,815
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1047
01:30:22,986 --> 01:30:24,928
It's fading already.

1048
01:30:25,098 --> 01:30:29,637
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1049
01:30:36,714 --> 01:30:39,332
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1050
01:30:39,498 --> 01:30:43,110
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1051
01:30:46,058 --> 01:30:47,334
You know, George...

1052
01:30:47,497 --> 01:30:51,010
...I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1053
01:30:51,178 --> 01:30:55,554
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1054
01:32:04,556 --> 01:32:06,149
All right, professor!

1055
01:32:14,573 --> 01:32:16,264
Here you go.

1056
01:32:40,205 --> 01:32:41,962
Ready when you are.

1057
01:34:04,207 --> 01:34:07,338
I need that prophecy.

1058
01:34:07,503 --> 01:34:09,228
You'll have to kill me.

1059
01:34:10,064 --> 01:34:14,439
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1060
01:34:14,609 --> 01:34:16,235
<i>Crucio.</i>

1061
01:34:18,673 --> 01:34:20,363
<i>Crucio.</i>

1062
01:34:31,281 --> 01:34:32,688
Sirius.

1063
01:34:32,849 --> 01:34:33,798
Harry, are you sure?

1064
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:36,335
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1065
01:34:36,497 --> 01:34:38,285
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1066
01:34:38,449 --> 01:34:40,424
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1067
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:42,447
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1068
01:34:42,609 --> 01:34:45,773
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1069
01:34:45,937 --> 01:34:47,792
Harry, please, just listen.

1070
01:34:49,233 --> 01:34:51,142
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1071
01:34:52,402 --> 01:34:55,401
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1072
01:34:55,569 --> 01:34:58,918
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1073
01:34:59,089 --> 01:35:02,438
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.

1074
01:35:04,945 --> 01:35:05,893
What do we do?

1075
01:35:07,251 --> 01:35:08,811
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1076
01:35:08,979 --> 01:35:10,953
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1077
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,616
Not all of them.

1078
01:35:15,314 --> 01:35:16,591
<i>Alohomora.</i>

1079
01:35:27,378 --> 01:35:29,004
Alert the Order if you can.

1080
01:35:29,171 --> 01:35:32,586
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1081
01:35:32,755 --> 01:35:36,235
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1082
01:35:36,403 --> 01:35:39,502
That you are.

1083
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:42,416
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1084
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:49,226
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1085
01:35:49,395 --> 01:35:51,337
- No.
- Liar.

1086
01:35:51,507 --> 01:35:54,224
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1087
01:35:54,387 --> 01:35:57,704
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1088
01:35:58,131 --> 01:35:59,593
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1089
01:35:59,763 --> 01:36:02,545
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1090
01:36:02,707 --> 01:36:05,708
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1091
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:11,027
Unless you wish to poison him...

1092
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:15,443
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1093
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,875
I cannot help you.

1094
01:36:20,213 --> 01:36:21,838
He's got Padfoot.

1095
01:36:22,836 --> 01:36:26,186
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1096
01:36:26,644 --> 01:36:28,684
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1097
01:36:28,853 --> 01:36:30,314
What is he talking about, Snape?

1098
01:36:36,725 --> 01:36:38,634
No idea.

1099
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,458
Very well.

1100
01:36:45,429 --> 01:36:47,665
You give me no choice, Potter.

1101
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:50,868
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1102
01:36:51,029 --> 01:36:53,004
...you leave me with...

1103
01:36:53,717 --> 01:36:55,604
...no alternative.

1104
01:36:56,373 --> 01:36:58,478
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1105
01:36:58,645 --> 01:36:59,593
That's illegal.

1106
01:36:59,765 --> 01:37:02,995
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1107
01:37:10,197 --> 01:37:11,659
Tell her, Harry!

1108
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:14,484
Tell me what?

1109
01:37:15,638 --> 01:37:17,548
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1110
01:37:18,198 --> 01:37:19,889
...I will.

1111
01:37:21,463 --> 01:37:23,186
Where what is?

1112
01:37:24,343 --> 01:37:26,546
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1113
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:32,812
How much further?

1114
01:37:32,983 --> 01:37:34,576
Not far.

1115
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:40,048
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1116
01:37:44,214 --> 01:37:45,621
What are you doing?

1117
01:37:45,782 --> 01:37:47,506
Lmprovising.

1118
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:57,197
Well?

1119
01:37:58,454 --> 01:38:00,495
Where is this weapon?

1120
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:07,379
There isn't one, is there?

1121
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:12,112
You were trying to trick me.

1122
01:38:16,152 --> 01:38:17,646
You know...

1123
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,942
...I really hate children.

1124
01:38:35,896 --> 01:38:40,151
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1125
01:38:42,712 --> 01:38:44,305
Lower your weapons.

1126
01:38:44,472 --> 01:38:49,775
I warn you, under the law,
as creatures of near-human intelligence...

1127
01:38:49,944 --> 01:38:51,122
<i>Protego.</i>

1128
01:38:51,384 --> 01:38:52,464
How dare you?

1129
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,542
Filthy half-breed.

1130
01:38:55,289 --> 01:38:56,237
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

1131
01:39:08,922 --> 01:39:11,409
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1132
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:16,050
Now, enough. I will have order.

1133
01:39:24,538 --> 01:39:26,993
You filthy animal.

1134
01:39:27,162 --> 01:39:30,009
Do you know who I am?

1135
01:39:30,169 --> 01:39:32,886
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1136
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:34,838
No, he doesn't understand.

1137
01:39:42,202 --> 01:39:45,518
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1138
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:47,545
I'm sorry, professor.

1139
01:39:47,706 --> 01:39:49,429
But I must not tell lies.

1140
01:39:49,594 --> 01:39:50,543
What are you doing?

1141
01:39:50,714 --> 01:39:54,391
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1142
01:39:54,842 --> 01:39:56,948
Let me go!

1143
01:39:59,515 --> 01:40:01,238
Thank you, Grawp.

1144
01:40:01,403 --> 01:40:04,752
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1145
01:40:12,697 --> 01:40:16,112
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1146
01:40:16,281 --> 01:40:18,321
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1147
01:40:18,489 --> 01:40:20,944
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1148
01:40:21,753 --> 01:40:23,182
That was clever, Ron.

1149
01:40:23,993 --> 01:40:26,382
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1150
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:28,277
So how are we getting to London?

1151
01:40:29,592 --> 01:40:32,975
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1152
01:40:33,785 --> 01:40:36,370
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1153
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:39,384
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1154
01:40:39,705 --> 01:40:41,745
Or was that all just words to you?

1155
01:40:43,545 --> 01:40:46,611
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1156
01:40:51,321 --> 01:40:53,393
So how are we going to get to London?

1157
01:40:54,747 --> 01:40:56,885
We fly, of course.

1158
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:47,923
<i>Department of Mysteries.</i>

1159
01:41:56,412 --> 01:41:58,037
This is it.

1160
01:42:48,861 --> 01:42:51,098
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1161
01:42:52,733 --> 01:42:54,042
Ninety-four.

1162
01:42:55,261 --> 01:42:56,243
Ninety-five.

1163
01:43:08,286 --> 01:43:10,937
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1164
01:43:13,534 --> 01:43:14,778
It's got your name on it.

1165
01:43:38,942 --> 01:43:43,132
<i>The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.</i>

1166
01:43:43,934 --> 01:43:46,269
<i>And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...</i>

1167
01:43:46,431 --> 01:43:49,115
<i>...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.</i>

1168
01:43:54,527 --> 01:43:59,677
<i>For neither can live
while the other survives.</i>

1169
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,127
Harry.

1170
01:44:13,183 --> 01:44:14,612
Where's Sirius?

1171
01:44:14,784 --> 01:44:19,672
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1172
01:44:22,464 --> 01:44:24,537
...and reality.

1173
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,494
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1174
01:44:31,168 --> 01:44:32,597
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1175
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:34,776
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1176
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,895
He knows how to play.

1177
01:44:40,064 --> 01:44:43,708
Itty, bitty baby.

1178
01:44:43,872 --> 01:44:45,050
Potter.

1179
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,391
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1180
01:44:47,553 --> 01:44:50,368
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1181
01:44:50,529 --> 01:44:52,318
Better, now they're
about to be avenged.

1182
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:59,646
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1183
01:45:00,098 --> 01:45:01,527
...shall we?

1184
01:45:01,697 --> 01:45:04,064
All we want is that prophecy.

1185
01:45:04,225 --> 01:45:06,330
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1186
01:45:06,497 --> 01:45:08,058
You dare speak his name?

1187
01:45:09,538 --> 01:45:11,064
You filthy half-blood!

1188
01:45:11,233 --> 01:45:13,721
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1189
01:45:15,585 --> 01:45:20,823
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1190
01:45:20,993 --> 01:45:23,612
Which is lucky for you, really.

1191
01:45:27,234 --> 01:45:29,089
Haven't you always wondered...

1192
01:45:29,569 --> 01:45:34,555
...what was the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1193
01:45:35,266 --> 01:45:37,655
Why he was unable to kill you...

1194
01:45:37,826 --> 01:45:40,247
...when you were just an infant?

1195
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:46,175
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1196
01:45:47,075 --> 01:45:51,298
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1197
01:45:52,451 --> 01:45:54,361
All you have to do...

1198
01:45:54,915 --> 01:45:56,770
...is give it to me.

1199
01:45:57,059 --> 01:46:00,223
Then I can show you everything.

1200
01:46:08,611 --> 01:46:10,335
I've waited 14 years.

1201
01:46:10,915 --> 01:46:12,159
I know.

1202
01:46:13,411 --> 01:46:16,226
<i>I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.</i>

1203
01:46:16,387 --> 01:46:17,762
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1204
01:46:33,251 --> 01:46:34,200
<i>Levicorpus.</i>

1205
01:46:40,484 --> 01:46:42,427
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

1206
01:46:42,596 --> 01:46:44,320
Well done, Neville.

1207
01:46:52,421 --> 01:46:53,915
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1208
01:46:55,589 --> 01:46:56,766
<i>- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.</i>

1209
01:47:07,461 --> 01:47:09,283
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1210
01:47:16,517 --> 01:47:18,721
<i>Reducto.</i>

1211
01:47:34,085 --> 01:47:36,092
Get back to the door.

1212
01:48:09,959 --> 01:48:14,269
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1213
01:48:19,271 --> 01:48:21,093
The voices.

1214
01:48:21,639 --> 01:48:23,581
Can you tell what they're saying?

1215
01:48:25,191 --> 01:48:27,264
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1216
01:48:27,975 --> 01:48:29,666
Let's get out of here.

1217
01:48:29,831 --> 01:48:31,358
I hear them too.

1218
01:48:34,344 --> 01:48:36,864
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1219
01:48:39,528 --> 01:48:40,870
Please, Harry.

1220
01:48:41,608 --> 01:48:43,397
Get behind me.

1221
01:49:28,041 --> 01:49:30,627
Did you actually believe...

1222
01:49:30,792 --> 01:49:35,200
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1223
01:49:35,786 --> 01:49:40,707
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1224
01:49:44,074 --> 01:49:47,653
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1225
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:54,406
Give me the prophecy now...

1226
01:49:54,570 --> 01:49:58,400
...or watch your friends die.

1227
01:50:10,795 --> 01:50:12,136
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1228
01:50:37,356 --> 01:50:40,006
Get away from my godson.

1229
01:51:08,876 --> 01:51:11,364
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1230
01:51:11,693 --> 01:51:13,449
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1231
01:51:13,613 --> 01:51:16,330
You've done beautifully.

1232
01:51:16,941 --> 01:51:18,534
Now, let me take it from here.

1233
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:19,649
Black.

1234
01:51:45,709 --> 01:51:46,986
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1235
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:48,426
Nice one, James.

1236
01:51:55,374 --> 01:51:56,781
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1237
01:52:16,174 --> 01:52:18,378
<i>No. No.</i>

1238
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:43,912
I killed Sirius Black.

1239
01:52:44,848 --> 01:52:46,735
<i>- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.</i>

1240
01:52:58,575 --> 01:53:01,575
<i>You've got to mean it, Harry.</i>

1241
01:53:01,743 --> 01:53:05,355
<i>She killed him. She deserves it.</i>

1242
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:12,106
<i>You know the spell, Harry.</i>

1243
01:53:23,184 --> 01:53:24,744
Do it.

1244
01:53:32,113 --> 01:53:34,960
So weak.

1245
01:53:41,458 --> 01:53:44,524
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1246
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:46,348
The Aurors are on their way.

1247
01:53:46,513 --> 01:53:50,539
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1248
01:53:52,018 --> 01:53:54,025
...shall be dead.

1249
01:56:02,837 --> 01:56:04,659
You've lost, old man.

1250
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:24,939
Harry.

1251
01:56:28,918 --> 01:56:30,347
<i>So weak.</i>

1252
01:56:30,838 --> 01:56:32,977
<i>So vulnerable.</i>

1253
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:38,059
Look at me.

1254
01:56:40,502 --> 01:56:44,561
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1255
01:56:44,726 --> 01:56:47,115
It's how you are not.

1256
01:56:51,862 --> 01:56:53,291
Harry?

1257
01:57:24,376 --> 01:57:25,783
You're the weak one...

1258
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:30,321
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1259
01:57:33,592 --> 01:57:36,374
And I feel sorry for you.

1260
01:57:58,489 --> 01:58:01,805
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1261
01:58:02,713 --> 01:58:07,633
And you will lose everything.

1262
01:58:21,978 --> 01:58:23,571
He's back.

1263
01:59:28,539 --> 01:59:30,132
I know how you feel, Harry.

1264
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:31,827
No, you don't.

1265
01:59:37,244 --> 01:59:38,585
It's my fault.

1266
01:59:38,747 --> 01:59:41,879
No, the fault is mine.

1267
01:59:42,844 --> 01:59:44,534
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1268
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:47,635
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.

1269
01:59:48,412 --> 01:59:52,503
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...

1270
01:59:52,668 --> 01:59:57,687
...he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.

1271
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:03,576
The prophecy said:

1272
02:00:04,156 --> 02:00:07,953
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives. "

1273
02:00:09,244 --> 02:00:15,061
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.

1274
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:18,484
Yes.

1275
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:20,436
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
02:00:20,605 --> 02:00:24,053
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1277
02:00:24,221 --> 02:00:26,555
The same reason your
friends saved you.

1278
02:00:27,357 --> 02:00:30,740
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1279
02:00:30,909 --> 02:00:33,692
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1280
02:00:35,101 --> 02:00:37,141
I cared too much about you.

1281
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:03,194
How come you're not at the feast?

1282
02:01:03,358 --> 02:01:07,733
Lost all my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding them.

1283
02:01:07,902 --> 02:01:08,851
That's awful.

1284
02:01:09,022 --> 02:01:10,844
Oh, it's all good fun.

1285
02:01:11,006 --> 02:01:14,323
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1286
02:01:14,495 --> 02:01:16,764
Do you want any help finding them?

1287
02:01:19,551 --> 02:01:22,617
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1288
02:01:29,375 --> 02:01:31,350
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1289
02:01:31,519 --> 02:01:33,112
That's all right.

1290
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:35,352
Anyway, my mum always said...

1291
02:01:35,519 --> 02:01:39,229
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1292
02:01:42,335 --> 02:01:45,466
If not always in the way we expect.

1293
02:01:46,912 --> 02:01:49,497
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1294
02:02:23,713 --> 02:02:26,496
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1295
02:02:26,657 --> 02:02:28,282
What's that?

1296
02:02:28,865 --> 02:02:31,516
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1297
02:02:31,681 --> 02:02:34,649
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1298
02:02:34,817 --> 02:02:36,246
Yeah?

1299
02:02:38,081 --> 02:02:40,350
Something worth fighting for.
