1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,176
Harry Potter and the
Order of the Phoenix

2
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,457
It's just too hot today isn't it?

3
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:55,156
And it's going to get even worse.

4
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:57,754
Temperatures up in the mid 30s Celsius.

5
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:01,753
And at night should go
up even, and perhaps...

6
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,447
Alright, lets go home.

7
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,445
What a lovely day.

8
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:17,342
Do we have to? We do.

9
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:32,732
Hey big D. Beat up another 10 year old?

10
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:35,031
This one deserved
it. - Ya. - Ya.

11
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:38,629
5 against 1, very brave.
Well you're the one to talk?

12
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,127
Moaning in your sleep every night.

13
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,725
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

14
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,421
Don't kill Cedric.

15
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:53,420
Who's Cedric? Your boyfriend? Shut up.

16
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:57,517
He's going to kill me, mom.

17
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,514
Where is your mom?

18
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:03,812
Where is your mom, Potter?

19
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:05,711
Is she dead?

20
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:08,709
Is she dead?!

21
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,808
Is she dead...

22
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,898
What's going on?

23
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,496
What's going on here?

24
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:30,396
What are you doing?

25
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:32,594
I'm not doing anything.

26
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:35,791
Dudley, come on!

27
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,464
Run!

28
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:24,461
Dudley, run!

29
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,138
Expecto Patronum!

30
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,019
Mrs. Figg.

31
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:38,613
Don't Put away your wand, Harry.
They might come back.

32
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,711
Dementors in little Winchik.
What's next?

33
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:44,709
Whole world's in top sterny.

34
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,508
L don't understand. How did you know...

35
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:48,806
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

36
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:51,605
Dumbledore? You know Dumbledore?

37
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:56,202
After You-Know-Who killed
that poor Diggory boy last year.

38
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:58,801
Did you expect him to let you go
wandering around alone?

39
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:01,199
Good Lord,
they told me you're intelligent.

40
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:04,497
Now, get inside and stay there.

41
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:06,196
Soon someone will be in touch with you.

42
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:09,294
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:27,082
Didlykin, is that you?

44
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:34,078
Dudley! Vernon come quick!

45
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:40,174
Who did this to you boy?

46
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:45,071
Happy, are we, now?

47
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,968
You finally done it.
You finally driven him loopey.

48
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:51,466
Vernon, don't you say that.

49
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,065
Just look at him, Petunia.

50
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:55,464
Our boy has gone yumpie.

51
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,663
L've reach my limit, you hear?

52
00:05:57,663 --> 00:06:02,060
This is the last l'm gonna
take you and your losses.

53
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,750
Dear Mr. Potter

54
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,049
The Ministry has received intelligence.

55
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:22,047
That at 6:23 this evening...

56
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:26,844
You performed the Petronas Charm
in the presence of a muggle.

57
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,042
As a clear violation of the decree...

58
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:33,040
For the reasonable restriction
of Underage Sorcery,

59
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,938
You are hereby expelled from
Hogwarts School of Witchcraf and Wizardry.

60
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:43,433
Hope that you are well, Mafilda Hopkerk.

61
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,330
Justice.

62
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:19,810
Sorry, Hedwig.

63
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,370
Hygienist, these muggles.

64
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,767
Tonks, for God's sake.

65
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:33,563
Professor Moody, what're you doing here?

66
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:35,961
To rescue you of course.

67
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,958
Where are we going?
That l'm just expelled from school.

68
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,457
You haven't been
Not yet.

69
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:43,556
Kingsley, you take front.

70
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,356
But the letter said...

71
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:46,754
Dumbledore has persuaded the Minister
to suspend your expeltion

72
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:48,453
Pending for your formal hearing.

73
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:49,653
A hearing?

74
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:50,652
Don't worry, Harry.

75
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:52,650
We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

76
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,649
Shh, not here, Nymphadora.

77
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,446
Don't call me Nymphadora.

78
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,943
Stay in formation everyone.

79
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:09,040
Don't break ranks if one of us was killed.

80
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,707
Come on.

81
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,682
Here you go, son.

82
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:04,666
Yes, but...

83
00:11:08,863 --> 00:11:09,663
He grew stronger by the minute.

84
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,662
We have to act now.

85
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,059
Harry.

86
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,557
Mrs. Weasley.

87
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:22,255
Thank God, you're alright.

88
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,751
Bit peaky.

89
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:30,150
L'm afraid, dinner, we're gonna have
to wait after the meeting finish.

90
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,848
Look. No time to explain.

91
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:35,246
Straight upstairs.
First door on the left.

92
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:36,945
Yeah.

93
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:19,918
Harry.

94
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:24,415
You alright?

95
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:26,913
We've heard them talking about the Dementors attack.

96
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,113
You must tell us everything.

97
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,812
Let him breath, Hermione.

98
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:34,109
And this hearing at the Ministry,
it's just outrageous.

99
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,107
They can't expel you.

100
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:38,006
Lt's completely unfair.

101
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,006
Yeah.

102
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:42,404
There's a lot going around me.

103
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:46,401
So what is this place?

104
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:48,000
Lt's headquarters.

105
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,899
The Order of The Phoenix.

106
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,598
Lt's a secret society.

107
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:54,096
Dumbledore formed it back in the first,
You-Know-Who.

108
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:57,095
You couldn't write any of this
in your letter l suppose?

109
00:12:57,394 --> 00:13:00,392
Whole summer without a scrap of news.

110
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:03,390
We thought to write, really, l did. Only...
Only What???

111
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,987
Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

112
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,085
Dumbledore said that?

113
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:15,282
But why he want to keep me in the dark?
Maybe l can help.

114
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:17,382
Afterall, l'm the one
who saw Voldermort returned.

115
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:18,480
L'm the one he fought with.

116
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,179
L'm the one who saw
Cedric Diggory get killed.

117
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,279
Harry.

118
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,278
Don't be so uptight.

119
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:25,276
Let it out.

120
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:26,776
Anyway, we heard the chatting.

121
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:29,873
Only had something more interesting.

122
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:33,271
Harry has the right to know.

123
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,169
Lf it wasn't him,
no one know he's back.

124
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:39,267
He's hardly a child, Molly.

125
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:39,967
But not an adult either.

126
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,766
He's not James, Sirius.

127
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:42,964
He's not your son.

128
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,663
He's as good as it.

129
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:46,662
No one else he's got.

130
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:48,361
He's got me.

131
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:52,359
Potter will grow up into a criminal.

132
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,358
Just like his Godfather.

133
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:55,656
Stay out of this, Severus.

134
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:58,056
Why don't you tell him?

135
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:12,545
Hermione, l hate your cat.

136
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:18,742
We'll be eating down in the kitchen.

137
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,040
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now,

138
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,738
Does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

139
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:26,737
Hi, mom.

140
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,735
You hungry, Harry?

141
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,734
You sure you're alright, Harry?

142
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:34,631
Harry Potter.

143
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:38,229
Sirius.

144
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,425
It is very very peculiar...

145
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,124
Lt seems that your hearing
at the Ministry...

146
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:49,222
Is to be before the entire Withem.

147
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,920
L don't understand why is the Ministry
of Magic go against me.

148
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,619
Show him.

149
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:57,118
He'd find out soon enough.

150
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:06,911
''The Boy Who Lies?''

151
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:09,409
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

152
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,508
''Fudge: All ls Well''

153
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,907
Fudge is using all his power.

154
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:17,004
Lncluding his influence
at the Daily Prophet.

155
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:19,503
Smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

156
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,502
Why?

157
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,800
The Minister thinks
Dumbledore's after his job.

158
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,699
But that's insane. No one in the right
mind would believe that Dumbledore...

159
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:28,498
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

160
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:31,595
He's been twisted and walked by fear.

161
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:33,893
Now, fear makes people do a lot of things.

162
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:36,392
The last time Voldermort gain power...

163
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:40,190
He almost destroyed everything
we hold on stand.

164
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,788
Now he has returned, l'm afraid
the Minister will do almost anything...

165
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:47,685
To avoid facing the terrifying truth.

166
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:52,882
We think Voldermort wants to
build up his army again.

167
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:56,779
14 years ago he had huge armies
in his command.

168
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:58,778
Not just witches to wizards

169
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:01,876
But a lot of dark creatures.

170
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:06,872
He's been recruiting, we've been
attempted to do the same.

171
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:10,871
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested.

172
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:17,466
We believe Voldermort
may be after something.

173
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:19,065
Sirius.

174
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:25,861
Something he didn't have last time.

175
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,858
You mean, like a weapon?

176
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:32,656
No, that's enough.
He's just a boy!

177
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:35,754
You say much more, you might as well
inducting him to the Order straight away.

178
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:37,353
Good. l want to join.

179
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:40,151
Lf Voldermort's recruiting the army
then l want to fight.

180
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:55,242
Harry.

181
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,141
You are hereby expelled.

182
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,339
Before the whole Withom.

183
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:09,033
The trains. Underground.

184
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,632
Genius these muggles.

185
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,420
Here we are.

186
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,517
L've never use this entrance before.

187
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,316
Lt should be fun.

188
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,914
L'll just get my money.

189
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,983
''Dumbledore - Deaf or Dangerous?''

190
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,069
Good morning, Arthur.

191
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:51,467
Morning, Bob.

192
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,465
Lnter Department Memos.

193
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:57,063
Used to use owls.

194
00:18:57,163 --> 00:19:01,162
The mess is unbelievable!

195
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:05,858
Merlin's Beard
Thank you, Kingsley.

196
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:09,456
They changed the time
of your hearing.

197
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:13,453
When is it?
In 5 minutes!

198
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:42,235
Remember, during the hearing
speak calmly if you are spoken too

199
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:43,734
Keep calm

200
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,132
You've done nothing wrong!

201
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:49,530
As the muggle say
"Truth will out!"

202
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,729
Yes?

203
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:56,026
I'm not allow in, I;m afraid.

204
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:57,625
Good luck, Harry.

205
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,921
Diciplinary Hearing of 12th August,

206
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:06,819
Into offences commited by
Harry James Potter...

207
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,917
Resident at no.4, Privet drive, Winshik,

208
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:12,316
Solicitor Cornelius Fudge... Minister...

209
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:15,713
Witness for Defense.

210
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:19,111
Albus Percivel Wilfred...

211
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:22,109
Brown Dumbledore.

212
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,407
You got our message that
the time and place...

213
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:27,106
Of the hearing has been changed,
did you?

214
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:28,306
L must have missed it.

215
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:33,403
But by mistake, l arrived
at the Ministry 3 hours early.

216
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,001
Charges?

217
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,999
The charges against the accused
are as follows...

218
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,098
That he did knowingly,

219
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:43,895
And in full aware this
legality of his action...

220
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:50,491
Produce of the Petronas Charm
in the presence of a muggle.

221
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:52,790
Do you deny producing said Petronus?

222
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,289
No, but...

223
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,888
And you were aware that you're forbidden
from using magic...

224
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:59,085
Outside school while under
the age of 17?

225
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,085
Yes, of course, but...

226
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:03,483
Witches and wizards of the Wizengemot..

227
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:06,981
L was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

228
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,578
Dementors? ln Little Winchik?

229
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:14,776
That's very clever.

230
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:17,974
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can't they, boy?

231
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:18,473
Highly convenient

232
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:21,271
L'm not lying. There were 2 of them.
lf l hadn't...

233
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:22,770
Enough!

234
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,068
L'm sorry to interrupt what have showed
in a very well rehearse story.

235
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:31,365
But since you can't produce
no witnesses of the event...

236
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:35,862
Pardon me, Minister.
Where as it happens, we can.

237
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,258
Please describe the attack.

238
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:47,055
What did they look like?

239
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:52,852
One of them was very large,
and the other one was skinny.

240
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:56,149
Not the boys.
The Dementors.

241
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,648
Alright, alright... oh well em...

242
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,946
Big.

243
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,346
Cloak.

244
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:05,443
Then... everything went cold.

245
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:09,340
Like all of the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,540
Now, look here.

247
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,337
Dementors don't just wander
into a muggle suburban.

248
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:16,036
Happen to cross with a wizard.

249
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:18,534
The odds are ternomecule.

250
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:19,834
L don't think anyone would've believe...

251
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:23,232
That the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

252
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:27,828
L'm sure l must've
misunderstood you, professor

253
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:32,626
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of Ministry of Magics.

254
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:37,623
So silly but it sounded,
for moment as though,

255
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,720
You're suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

256
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,619
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Under-Secretary.

257
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:48,616
Which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting
a full scale enquiry...

258
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:52,114
Into why the 2 Dementors were
surveiling very far from Azkaban...

259
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:55,511
And why they attack
without the authorization?

260
00:22:56,211 --> 00:23:01,807
Of course there is someone who might be
behind the attack.

261
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:08,103
Cornelius, l employ you to see reason.

262
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:12,900
The evidence the Dark Lord have returned
is incontrovertible.

263
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,798
He's not back!

264
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:23,594
Ln the matter of Harry Potter

265
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:26,291
The Law say in this states,

266
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:31,288
That magic may be used before muggles
in life threatening situation.

267
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:34,186
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

268
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:37,185
Really? It is become a practive to hold a
full criminal trial...

269
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:40,982
To deal with a simple matter
of Underage Magic?

270
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:51,875
Those, in favor of conviction.

271
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,967
Those in favor of clearing the accuse
of all charges.

272
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,857
Clear the whole charges.

273
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:25,354
Professor!

274
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:40,644
Padfoot, are you barking mad?

275
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:44,642
You'll blow the entire operation!

276
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:53,535
Sirius, what are you doing here?
lf someone sees you...

277
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:56,334
L had to see you off tonight.

278
00:24:57,433 --> 00:25:00,431
What's life without a little risk?

279
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,729
L don't want to see you get trapped
back into Azkaban.

280
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,329
Don't worry about me.

281
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:09,326
Anyway, l wanted you to have this.

282
00:25:14,122 --> 00:25:17,420
Orginal Order of the Phoenix.

283
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,419
Marlene McKenine.

284
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:22,118
She was killed 2 weeks after
this was taken.

285
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:25,215
Voldermort wiped out her entire family.

286
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,514
Franklin and Ellis Longbottom.

287
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:28,913
Neville's parents.

288
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:33,111
They suffered a foughtless death.

289
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,608
Lt's been 14 years.

290
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:41,704
There isn't a day goes by
l don't miss your dad.

291
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:49,300
Do you really think
there's gonna be a war, Sirius?

292
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,197
Lt feels like it did before.

293
00:25:58,394 --> 00:26:00,193
You keep it.

294
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:05,190
Anyway, l suppose
you're the young ones now.

295
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:20,380
Bye...

296
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:02,952
L surprise the Ministry still let you
walk out free, Potter.

297
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:04,352
You better enjoy while you can.

298
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:08,649
Or else a cell in Azkaban
will have your name on it.

299
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:11,847
What I tell you
He's a complete nutter

300
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:15,145
You stay away from me!

301
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:19,142
It's only Malfoy
Just relax.

302
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:42,328
Hi guys.

303
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,227
Hi, Neville.

304
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:58,317
What is it?

305
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:00,516
What's what?

306
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:03,714
That. Pulling the carriage.

307
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:06,812
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

308
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:09,010
Lt's pulling itself, like always.

309
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:26,099
You are not going mad...

310
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,898
L can see them too.

311
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:32,995
You're just the sane as l am.

312
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,491
Everyone, this is Loneylov...

313
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,389
Luna Lovegood.

314
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:49,984
Lnteresting necklace.

315
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:52,383
Lt's a charm actually.

316
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:55,580
Keeps away the Naragos.

317
00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:03,676
L'm hungry. l hope there's a pudding.

318
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,074
What's a Naragos?

319
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:06,873
No idea.

320
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:22,264
Good evening, children.

321
00:29:22,264 --> 00:29:24,762
Now we have 2 changes in staff this year.

322
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,860
Please welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank.

323
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,159
Who'd be taking care of
magical creatures,

324
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,856
While Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leaves.

325
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,353
We're also pleased to welcome our new
Defense Against Dark Arts teacher,

326
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:41,351
Professor Dolores Umbridge.

327
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:45,849
L'm sure you all will join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

328
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:51,245
As usual our care taker Mr. Filch
has ask me to remind you...

329
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:04,337
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

330
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:10,433
Thank you, headmaster
for those kind words of welcome.

331
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:16,129
And how lovely to see all
your bright, happy faces...

332
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,928
Smiling up to me.

333
00:30:18,328 --> 00:30:23,125
L'm sure we'll all going to be
very good friends.

334
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,923
That's likely.
-That's likely.

335
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:30,820
The Ministry of Magic,
has always considered...

336
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,518
The education of young witches
and wizards...

337
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:36,616
To be a vital importance.

338
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:40,214
Although each headmaster
has brought something new...

339
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:43,111
To this historic school.

340
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:51,207
Progress for the sake of progress
must be discourage.

341
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:55,604
Let us preserve
what must be preserved.

342
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:59,102
Perfect what can't be perfected...

343
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:05,398
And proove actism,
in order to beat pro-imitate.

344
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:13,892
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.

345
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:16,190
That really was constant minimizing.

346
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,290
Minimizing? What?

347
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,888
What does it mean?

348
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:26,085
It means the Ministry interfering Hogwarts.

349
00:31:43,973 --> 00:31:48,670
Dean, Seamus, good holiday?

350
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,569
Alright, better than Seamus' actually.

351
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:55,865
My mom didn't want me
to come back this year.

352
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:56,864
Why not?

353
00:31:57,365 --> 00:31:59,663
Let me see, because of you.

354
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:01,861
The Daily Prophet has been saying
a lot of things about you, Harry.

355
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:03,061
And about Dumbledore as well!

356
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:04,260
Your mom believes them?

357
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,258
Well, nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

358
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,458
Well, l guess you should read the Prophet
like your stupid mother.

359
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:09,656
Lt'll tell you
everything you need to know.

360
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:10,087
Don't you dare tell me.

361
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:12,854
L'll never let go anyone
that calls me a liar.

362
00:32:12,854 --> 00:32:13,454
What's going on?

363
00:32:13,454 --> 00:32:15,452
He is what's going on.

364
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:17,151
Do you believe the words
he commended, you or him?

365
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:20,549
Yeah, l do.

366
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,748
Does anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

367
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:32,942
You alright?

368
00:32:32,942 --> 00:32:34,241
Fine.

369
00:32:34,641 --> 00:32:37,139
Seamus was backout there.

370
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:39,337
He'll go through it. We'll see.

371
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:41,636
L said l'm fine, Ron.

372
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:48,832
Alright. l just leave you
to your thought, huh?

373
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:37,700
Come on, Seamus, go on, get it

374
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:54,389
Good morning, children

375
00:33:55,989 --> 00:34:01,185
Ordinary Wizarding Level Examinations

376
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:04,083
OWLS

377
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,681
Well, commonly known as... OWLS

378
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,178
Study hard and you'll be awarded

379
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:17,075
Failed to do so, and the consequences
maybe... severe

380
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:26,069
Your previous instruction subjects
have been disturbingly uneven

381
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,768
But please to know from now on...

382
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:31,266
You'll be following a carefully
structured

383
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:34,664
Ministry approved course of
defensive magic

384
00:34:34,764 --> 00:34:36,163
Yes?

385
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:38,561
.. there isn't something about using the
defensive spells

386
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:40,260
Using spells?

387
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,557
Why would you need spells in my
classroom?

388
00:34:45,557 --> 00:34:46,756
We aren't using magics

389
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:52,352
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risks-free way

390
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:53,252
What use is that?

391
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:55,251
We're gonna be attacked,
it won't be risks-free

392
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:59,248
Students will raise their hands when
speak in my class

393
00:35:01,546 --> 00:35:03,945
Lt's the view of the ministry

394
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:06,743
That a theoretical knowledge'll be
sufficient...

395
00:35:06,743 --> 00:35:09,642
To get you thru your examinations,
which after all...

396
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:11,540
Ls what schools are all about

397
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,138
And how's theories supposed to
prepare us for out there?

398
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,536
There's nothing out there, dear

399
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:19,735
Who do you imagine'd attack
children like yourselves?

400
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,632
L don't know, maybe Lord Voldermort

401
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:37,124
Now let me make this quite plain

402
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:39,223
You've been told...

403
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:44,619
That a certain dark wizard is at
large once again

404
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:47,617
This is a lie!

405
00:35:47,617 --> 00:35:50,915
It's not lie, i saw him, l fought..
-Detention, Mr Potter

406
00:35:51,414 --> 00:35:53,614
So, according to your say,
Diggory dropped of his own?

407
00:35:53,614 --> 00:35:56,212
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic
accident

408
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,410
He was murdered, Voldermort killed
him, you must know that

409
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,608
Enough... enough!

410
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:06,005
See me later, Mr Potter... my office

411
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,988
Come in

412
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:38,784
Good evening, Mr Potter

413
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,284
Sit

414
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:51,277
You're gonna be doing some lines
for me today, Mr Potter

415
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:53,275
No, not with your quill

416
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:56,673
Cause you're gonna be using
a rather special 1 of mine

417
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,267
Now, I want you to write

418
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:09,865
I must not tell lies!

419
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:13,362
How many times?

420
00:37:13,362 --> 00:37:17,360
Lets say, as long it take the
message to sink you

421
00:37:19,758 --> 00:37:21,657
You haven't given me any ink

422
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,055
You won't need any inks

423
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:13,523
Yes?

424
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:21,918
Nothing

425
00:38:22,018 --> 00:38:24,317
That's rite

426
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:28,314
Because you know deep down

427
00:38:28,614 --> 00:38:31,312
You deserved to be punished

428
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,810
Don't you, Mr Potter?

429
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:39,806
Go on

430
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:49,401
Skiving snack box

431
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:50,300
Sweets'll make you ill

432
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Lt'll get you outta class

433
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:56,296
Let's take hours of pleasures
outta school boredom

434
00:38:56,996 --> 00:38:57,995
You care for another?

435
00:38:57,995 --> 00:38:59,194
L'm not asking you to write all of it for me

436
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:00,893
Oh please

437
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:03,891
L'm just busy studying this stupid owls exams

438
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:05,790
L'll do the introductions
That's all!

439
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,688
Hermione, you're the most wonderful
person i've ever known

440
00:39:09,688 --> 00:39:11,387
L'll never be rude to you again

441
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,386
Only l bet you will

442
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:20,081
What's wrong with your hand?

443
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:22,480
Nothing

444
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,378
The other hand

445
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:28,676
You've gotta tell Dumbledore

446
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:32,273
No, Dumbledore's got enough
in his mind rite now

447
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:34,372
Anyway i want to get Umbridge's
her satisfaction

448
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,170
Bloody hell she was torturing you

449
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,369
Lf your parents know about this...

450
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:41,168
Yeah, i haven't got any parents,
have l?

451
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:45,465
Harry, you've gotta report this

452
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:46,664
It's perfectly simple....

453
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:49,063
No! It's not...

454
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:53,060
Hermoine, what ever this is;
It's not simple

455
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,157
You don't understand!

456
00:39:57,457 --> 00:40:01,455
Then help us to...

457
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:17,444
Dear Padfoot, i hope you're alrite

458
00:40:17,544 --> 00:40:19,743
Lt's getting cooler here

459
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:22,941
Winter's definitely on the way

460
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,836
Despite i've been back to Hogwarts,
i feel more alone than ever

461
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:34,233
L know you but all people will
understand

462
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:10,111
Hello Harry Potter

463
00:41:10,211 --> 00:41:12,908
Your feet, aren't you cold?

464
00:41:12,908 --> 00:41:15,507
A bit

465
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:19,505
Unfortunately all my shoes
are mysteriously disappeared

466
00:41:20,004 --> 00:41:24,001
I suspect nigel are behind this

467
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:29,338
What are they?

468
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:31,797
The Carl Pastro

469
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:35,194
They're gentle really, but...

470
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:38,492
People avoid them because,
they've been...

471
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,789
Different

472
00:41:45,688 --> 00:41:48,086
Why can't the other see?

473
00:41:48,086 --> 00:41:51,484
They can only been by
people who's seen death

474
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:56,082
So you know someone who's gone?

475
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,980
My mum

476
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,678
She was quiet an extraordinary witch

477
00:42:00,878 --> 00:42:03,176
She did a lot of experiments though

478
00:42:03,176 --> 00:42:06,274
One day 1 of her spells went badly wrong

479
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,674
L was 9

480
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:09,173
L'm sorry

481
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:11,471
Lt was rather horrible

482
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:14,470
L do feel very sad about it sometimes

483
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,868
But i've a dad

484
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:21,664
My dad and l believe you by the way

485
00:42:24,163 --> 00:42:26,262
And he must not be named's back

486
00:42:26,262 --> 00:42:27,362
And you fought him

487
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:30,759
And the Ministry extremely tough for that
conspiring you and Dumbledore

488
00:42:32,557 --> 00:42:34,757
Thanks, seems that you're the
only who do

489
00:42:34,757 --> 00:42:36,656
L don't think that's true

490
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:41,352
I supposed that is how you wanted it to be.

491
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:43,251
What do you mean?

492
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,649
Lf i were You Know Who!

493
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:49,347
L don't want you to feel crowd
from anyone else

494
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:55,244
Because if it's just you alone...
you aren't much as a threat

495
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,631
Would you ever stop eating?

496
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,829
L'm hungry

497
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:21,327
Harry

498
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:24,625
Can i join you?

499
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:28,422
Prof, what exactly are you insinuating?

500
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:31,420
I am only requesting when
it come to my students

501
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,417
You conformed to prescribe
disciplinary practices

502
00:43:35,618 --> 00:43:37,816
Seems silly of me but it sounds

503
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:41,714
That you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom

504
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:42,912
Minerva

505
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:45,212
Not at all, Dolores

506
00:43:45,212 --> 00:43:48,709
Merely your medieval methods

507
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,208
L'm sorry, dear

508
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:53,406
But to question my practices is
to question the ministry

509
00:43:53,406 --> 00:43:56,704
And by extension, the minister himself

510
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:58,403
L'm a tolerant woman

511
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:01,301
But the 1 thing i won't stand
for is disloyalty

512
00:44:05,098 --> 00:44:07,397
Disloyalty

513
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:12,094
Things at Hogwarts are far worse
than i feared

514
00:44:12,294 --> 00:44:15,192
Cornelius will want to take immediate actions

515
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:28,284
What happened to Dumbledore?

516
00:44:30,682 --> 00:44:33,181
Umbridge revolutionised the teaching
of defence against the dark art

517
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,377
Doleres Umbridge will as High Inquisitor
have powers

518
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:45,772
To adjust the seriously falling
standards of Hogwarts school

519
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:54,467
Just 1 question

520
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:58,865
You've been in this post for how
long exactly?

521
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,558
You ask first for the Defend
Againts the Dark Art Teacher

522
00:45:08,558 --> 00:45:10,057
Ls that correct?

523
00:45:10,357 --> 00:45:11,655
Yes

524
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:15,554
But you were unsuccessful

525
00:45:16,353 --> 00:45:18,052
Obviously

526
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:54,128
Would you please predict something,
please?

527
00:45:54,828 --> 00:45:56,827
L'm sorry

528
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:11,518
One tiny little propecy

529
00:46:17,414 --> 00:46:19,313
Pity

530
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:22,211
No, wait... i think 1 do see something,
yes

531
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:24,110
L saw something dark

532
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:28,107
You're in a grave danger

533
00:46:29,906 --> 00:46:31,405
Lovely...

534
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,497
Cho, what's going on?

535
00:46:43,697 --> 00:46:45,695
Lt's professor, Trelawney

536
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,777
16 years i've been here to teach

537
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:20,673
Hogwarts is my home

538
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,371
You can't do this

539
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,869
Actually i can

540
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:35,864
Minerva

541
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:37,763
Something you'd like to say, dear?

542
00:47:37,763 --> 00:47:40,760
Oh there're several things
i'd like to say

543
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,649
Prof McGonagall

544
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:00,948
May i ask you to escort Sybil
back inside?

545
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:03,146
Sybil, come here

546
00:48:04,246 --> 00:48:06,744
Thank you, Dumbledore

547
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:09,442
Dumbledore, may i remind you

548
00:48:09,942 --> 00:48:13,939
Under the tone of educational decree
23 as it acted by the minister

549
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:16,838
You've the right to dismiss my teacher

550
00:48:17,137 --> 00:48:21,035
But you don't have the authority
to banish them from the garden

551
00:48:21,035 --> 00:48:24,533
That power remained for the headmaster

552
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:27,430
For now

553
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:34,925
Don't you have studying to do?

554
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:36,525
Professor?

555
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:39,423
Professor?

556
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,422
Professor Dumbledore? Professor?

557
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,320
Professor Dumbledore?

558
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:57,212
Foul evil Gargoyle!!

559
00:48:57,212 --> 00:48:59,410
We aren't learning how to defend
ourselves

560
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,909
We aren't learning how to pass our OWLS

561
00:49:02,308 --> 00:49:04,307
She's taking over the entire school

562
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:08,804
Security's and will remain the
ministry's top priority

563
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:11,802
Furthermore, we've convincing evidence

564
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:14,101
That these disappearances are
the work of...

565
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:18,598
The notorious mass murderer,
Sirius Black....

566
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,497
Harry

567
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:21,896
Sirius

568
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:23,994
What are you doing here?

569
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,494
Answering you your letter

570
00:49:25,594 --> 00:49:27,392
You said you're worried about Umbridge

571
00:49:27,392 --> 00:49:30,390
What's she doing? Training
you to kill the half-bred?

572
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,290
She isn't letting us to use magic at all

573
00:49:32,689 --> 00:49:33,888
L'm not surprised

574
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,886
The latest intelligence says that Fudge
doesn't want you to train in combat

575
00:49:37,986 --> 00:49:39,184
Combat?

576
00:49:39,985 --> 00:49:41,684
He afraid we're forming some
sorta wizard army?

577
00:49:41,684 --> 00:49:43,682
This's exactly what he thinks

578
00:49:43,682 --> 00:49:47,979
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the ministry

579
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:51,277
He's becoming more crack on the edge

580
00:49:51,277 --> 00:49:55,274
The others wouldn't want me to
tell you this, Harry

581
00:49:55,274 --> 00:49:58,273
Things aren't going all well, the order

582
00:49:58,273 --> 00:49:59,771
Fudge's blocking the truth in every turn

583
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:04,569
These disappearances as much
how it started before

584
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:08,466
Voldermort is on the move

585
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:11,064
What do we do?

586
00:50:11,064 --> 00:50:14,662
Someone is coming, i'm sorry
i can't be more help

587
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:18,960
But for now, it looks like
you're on your own

588
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:32,750
He's out there isn't he?

589
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:37,448
We've gotta be able to defend ourselves

590
00:50:37,747 --> 00:50:42,144
Lf Umbridge refuses to teach us
how we need someone who'll

591
00:50:57,335 --> 00:50:59,334
Harry

592
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:11,326
This is mad,
who want to be tough by me?

593
00:51:11,326 --> 00:51:12,725
L'm a nut, remember?

594
00:51:12,725 --> 00:51:14,424
Look at the bright side.

595
00:51:14,424 --> 00:51:17,521
You can't be any worse than her, anyway

596
00:51:17,521 --> 00:51:18,921
Thanks, Ron

597
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:20,720
Anything, mate

598
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,118
Who supposed to make this?

599
00:51:23,118 --> 00:51:25,017
Just a couple of people

600
00:51:30,513 --> 00:51:32,012
Lovely spot.

601
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,409
Well, at least safer than being tracked

602
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:38,808
Hey come back here

603
00:51:47,102 --> 00:51:50,201
Hi, So...

604
00:51:50,201 --> 00:51:51,900
We know why we're here

605
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,499
We need a teacher

606
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,197
Proper teacher

607
00:51:56,897 --> 00:52:00,094
One has really experienced to defend
himself against the dark arts

608
00:52:00,195 --> 00:52:02,094
Why?
-Why?

609
00:52:02,094 --> 00:52:03,492
Because you know who's back you toadpole

610
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:04,692
So as "HE" says

611
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:05,591
So as Dumbledore says

612
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,890
So Dumbledore says because He says?

613
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,288
The point is where's the proof?

614
00:52:11,987 --> 00:52:15,884
Perhaps Harry could tell us more
about Diggory got killed

615
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:18,883
L'm not gonna talk about Cedric

616
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:21,281
If that is why you're here,
you might as well clear up now

617
00:52:21,281 --> 00:52:24,279
Come on Hermione, let's go,
these are some sorts freaks

618
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:27,577
Ls that true you can produce petronus charm?

619
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:31,974
Yes

620
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:35,072
L've seen it

621
00:52:35,872 --> 00:52:37,571
Blimey Harry, l don't
know you can do that?

622
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:39,569
He killed a Basilisk...

623
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:41,668
With a sword in Dumbledore's office

624
00:52:41,768 --> 00:52:42,367
Lt's true

625
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:46,465
Third year he fought
about 100 dementor to 1

626
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,463
And last year he really did
fight who went to flash

627
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:51,262
Wait

628
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,058
Those sound great when you
say it like that, but...

629
00:52:57,058 --> 00:52:59,357
Ln fact, i was just lucky

630
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:01,655
L didn't know what i was doing
half of the time

631
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:03,654
L nearly always had helped

632
00:53:03,654 --> 00:53:07,352
He's just being modest
-No, Hermione, i'm not

633
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:13,547
Facing these stuff in real life isn't
like in school

634
00:53:14,947 --> 00:53:17,644
Lt isn't like you made a mistake you
can try just try again tomorrow

635
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:19,644
But out there

636
00:53:20,443 --> 00:53:23,741
When you're a second away from
being murdered

637
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:27,739
Or watching a friend die right
before your eyes

638
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:32,135
You don't know how it's like

639
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,929
You're right, Harry, we don't

640
00:53:43,528 --> 00:53:45,528
That's why we need your help

641
00:53:45,528 --> 00:53:47,726
Because the one we try of beating...

642
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:52,223
Voldermort

643
00:53:54,822 --> 00:53:56,820
He's really back?

644
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:12,110
''Dumbledore Army''

645
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:21,005
1st we need to find a place where
Umbridge won't find out

646
00:54:21,005 --> 00:54:21,904
The shrinking shack?

647
00:54:22,103 --> 00:54:23,603
That's too small

648
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:24,602
Forbidden forest?

649
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:25,801
Too bloody horrible

650
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:28,500
Harry, what happened if Umbridge
does find out?

651
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,399
Who cares?

652
00:54:30,498 --> 00:54:33,597
L mean... it''s exciting, isn't it?

653
00:54:33,697 --> 00:54:35,095
Breaking the rules

654
00:54:35,095 --> 00:54:36,295
Who are you and what have
you done to Hermoine Granger?

655
00:54:38,093 --> 00:54:41,891
Anyway, at least we knew that is
1 positive thing that is coming in today...

656
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:45,888
What's that?

657
00:54:49,985 --> 00:54:51,884
For the next few days we should...

658
00:54:51,884 --> 00:54:55,882
Each come out for a couple of place we can use for practise

659
00:54:55,882 --> 00:54:59,780
We gotta make sure Umbridge
won't find out this place

660
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:12,572
All student organisations disbanded

661
00:55:17,468 --> 00:55:19,367
Watch where you're going Longbottom

662
00:55:54,344 --> 00:55:55,943
You've done it Neville!

663
00:55:55,943 --> 00:55:57,942
You have found the room of requirement

664
00:55:57,942 --> 00:55:59,042
What?

665
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:01,839
This's also called come-and-go-room

666
00:56:01,939 --> 00:56:05,237
The room only appears when
a person's immediate needs

667
00:56:05,537 --> 00:56:09,335
And it always equips
with what the person needs

668
00:56:09,335 --> 00:56:12,733
So, you really needed a toilet?

669
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:14,931
Charming really

670
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:19,429
Lt's great

671
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:22,526
Just like Hogwarts wants to fight back

672
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,117
"Expeliarmus"

673
00:56:39,516 --> 00:56:40,615
L'm hopeless

674
00:56:40,615 --> 00:56:43,913
You're just flourishing your wand
too much, try like this

675
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:47,910
"Expeliarmus"

676
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:51,907
Would you please copy your
whole text 4 times

677
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:55,305
To ensure maximum attention

678
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:57,004
You don't need to talk

679
00:56:57,004 --> 00:56:58,903
L think it's more like it

680
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:01,802
Wands, away!

681
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:15,692
Stuning is the most useful spell in arsenal..

682
00:57:15,692 --> 00:57:19,190
Lt's sorta a wizard fighting a battle
really

683
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:24,187
Come on, Nigel, give your best shot

684
00:57:27,585 --> 00:57:29,584
Stupify

685
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,679
Good, not bad... at all

686
00:57:44,574 --> 00:57:46,273
Don't worry about, Hermione,
I'll go easy

687
00:57:46,273 --> 00:57:48,072
Thanks, Ron

688
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,370
Go on, Ron...

689
00:57:56,166 --> 00:58:00,164
1 second
You're on!

690
00:58:04,462 --> 00:58:08,459
"Stupify"

691
00:58:11,456 --> 00:58:13,355
Thank you
-Shut up

692
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:15,754
L let her do that

693
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:19,951
It's embarassing

694
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:22,549
Lt's really my intention

695
00:58:42,537 --> 00:58:46,035
''All students will submit to
questioning''

696
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:51,831
Come on, do you want a cup of tea?

697
00:58:52,431 --> 00:58:55,828
Focus on the fixed point, try again

698
00:58:56,029 --> 00:59:00,026
"Expeliarmus"

699
00:59:00,226 --> 00:59:04,223
You need to keep your concentration...

700
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:05,423
Great

701
00:59:07,321 --> 00:59:08,820
Aim Higher

702
00:59:16,915 --> 00:59:18,514
L'm ok...

703
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,789
Working hard is important, there's
something about this even more...

704
00:59:58,789 --> 01:00:02,786
Believing in yourself

705
01:00:03,185 --> 01:00:06,883
Think of this, every great
wizard in history

706
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:09,081
Started out...

707
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:12,879
Nothing more than what we're now...
students

708
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:16,876
Lf they can do it, why not us?

709
01:01:03,547 --> 01:01:07,544
"Expeliarumus"

710
01:01:08,743 --> 01:01:12,741
Fantastic, well done, mate

711
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,038
So, that's it for this lesson

712
01:01:16,038 --> 01:01:19,436
We aren't gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays

713
01:01:19,436 --> 01:01:22,335
So just keep practising on
your own best you can

714
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:26,332
And well done, everyone,
great great work

715
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:31,829
Well done mate.

716
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:35,826
Thanks

717
01:01:39,224 --> 01:01:43,221
See you after Christmas

718
01:01:50,017 --> 01:01:53,415
See you in the common room Harry

719
01:01:53,415 --> 01:01:57,012
Thanks a lot, Harry

720
01:01:57,012 --> 01:01:58,212
Merry Christmas

721
01:01:58,212 --> 01:02:02,209
Harry Merry Christmas

722
01:02:03,908 --> 01:02:06,707
Have a merry christmas, Luna

723
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:10,704
We've been thinking, Harry

724
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:16,100
Sounds great, guys,
would you excuse me?

725
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:27,193
Are you alrite?

726
01:02:27,193 --> 01:02:29,991
L heard Umbridge gave you a
hard time the other day

727
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:32,890
Yeah, i'm ok

728
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,887
Lt's worth it

729
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:44,582
Just... learning all these

730
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:47,980
Made me wonder maybe he would...

731
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:51,178
Cedric... gave me all these stuff

732
01:02:51,178 --> 01:02:54,275
He was really good

733
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:58,274
Lt was just Voldermort was better

734
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:04,170
You're a really good teacher, Harry

735
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:08,167
L've never been able to
stunt anything before

736
01:03:15,662 --> 01:03:19,659
Mistletoe

737
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:23,557
It keeps the Naragos out

738
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:25,655
What are Naragos?

739
01:03:25,655 --> 01:03:29,654
L've no idea

740
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:51,439
Well, how was it?

741
01:03:51,439 --> 01:03:53,538
Wet

742
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,637
L mean she was sorta crying

743
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:57,835
Not that bad, are you?

744
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:01,833
L'm sure Harry's kising's
more than satisfactory

745
01:04:03,032 --> 01:04:05,330
Cho's been half of the time
crying these days

746
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:08,928
L bet snogging will cheer her up

747
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:12,925
You don't know how
she must be feeling?

748
01:04:17,222 --> 01:04:19,321
Obviously she feel sad about Cedric

749
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:21,620
And now got more
confused now with Harry

750
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:25,617
Guilty about kissing him

751
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:30,914
And she worry about everything else

752
01:04:31,114 --> 01:04:33,113
One person can fill all that...

753
01:04:33,113 --> 01:04:34,812
They'll explode

754
01:04:34,812 --> 01:04:38,809
It's because you've
got an emotional range of tea spoon!!!

755
01:05:02,993 --> 01:05:06,092
"Voldermort maybe after something!"

756
01:05:06,092 --> 01:05:09,889
"Something he didn't have last time!"

757
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:12,887
"Harry"

758
01:05:12,887 --> 01:05:16,885
"Harry!"

759
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:47,465
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim?

760
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:49,264
Or looking down at the scene?

761
01:05:49,264 --> 01:05:52,861
Neither... It was like I'm who...

762
01:05:52,861 --> 01:05:54,560
Professor would you please tell me what happening...

763
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,258
Everard, Arthur on guard at night

764
01:05:57,258 --> 01:05:59,258
Make sure he is found by the right people.

765
01:05:59,258 --> 01:06:00,556
Sir....

766
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,755
Phileus, you must go to
your potrait in the Grimould Place

767
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:06,352
Tell them Arthur Weasly is gravely injured

768
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:10,351
And his children will be
arriving there soon by portkey

769
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,150
They got it Albus...

770
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,648
It was close but they got in

771
01:06:13,648 --> 01:06:16,047
What's more the Dark Lord failed to acquired...

772
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:17,846
Ah, thank you..

773
01:06:17,846 --> 01:06:21,843
Look at me!!!

774
01:06:25,741 --> 01:06:29,738
What's happening to me?

775
01:06:35,334 --> 01:06:37,633
You wish to see me headmaster?

776
01:06:37,633 --> 01:06:40,531
Oh Severus, I am very can't wait!

777
01:06:40,531 --> 01:06:42,430
Not even in the morning!

778
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:46,427
Otherwise we will be vulnerable!

779
01:06:49,825 --> 01:06:53,722
Its appear that there is a connection
between the Dark Lord minds and your own

780
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:57,720
Weather he is as yet aware of this connection
is not clear

781
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:01,218
Pray he remains ignorant

782
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:03,516
You mean if he knows about it,

783
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:06,015
He'll be able to read my mind.

784
01:07:06,015 --> 01:07:10,012
Read it, controll it... and injured.

785
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:15,109
In the past it was often the Dark Lord pleasure
to invade the minds of his victims creating visions

786
01:07:18,406 --> 01:07:21,405
Design to torture them to madness...

787
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:25,402
Only after extracting the last exquisit answer of agony

788
01:07:26,402 --> 01:07:30,399
Only when they had literally begging for death he finally kill them

789
01:07:32,498 --> 01:07:36,495
Use properly the power of Occlumency will help shield you from access or influence

790
01:07:38,394 --> 01:07:42,391
In this lesson i will attemp to penetrate your mind

791
01:07:43,491 --> 01:07:46,489
You will attemp to resist

792
01:07:46,489 --> 01:07:50,486
Prepare yourself!!!

793
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:04,177
Concentrate POTTER...

794
01:08:30,961 --> 01:08:33,159
Here we go...

795
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:37,156
Daddy's back

796
01:08:38,556 --> 01:08:42,553
Sit down, everybody, sit down,
now's time for presents
