1
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,991
Good day, sir.

2
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,239
In his office there, miss.

3
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,026
Uh, Baines, is, uh -
is the ambassador's car at the door?

4
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,528
- <i>It's waiting, sir.</i>
- His Excellency has been delayed.
He'll drive straight to the airport.

5
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,598
Of course.

6
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,369
Oh, uh, Baines, flowers for her room.

7
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:33,935
You know the sort my wife likes. After eight
months in a hospital the place must look like home.

8
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,072
She'll find everything
just as she left it, sir.

9
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,878
The doctors don't yet know
if they'll permit her to fly.

10
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,647
- The journey will be a strain.
- Master Phillipe, sir.

11
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,386
He should have his hair cut.
He looks as if we've neglected him.

12
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,224
- Any message for your mother, Phillipe?
- Tell her I've got something to show her.

13
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,822
That will bring her home.
Look after the embassy while I'm away.

14
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,992
Be back on Monday morning
with my wife, I hope.

15
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,560
<i> I hope so too, Your Excellency.</i>
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

16
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,606
<i>Papa. Papa.</i>

17
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,685
<i>Au revoir, Papa.</i>

18
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,272
Hello, Macgregor.

19
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,343
Aw.

20
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,579
Hello, Macgregor. Hello.

21
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,315
Come on. Come on. Hmm.

22
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,855
Come on.

23
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,856
Oh.

24
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,860
Look. London.

25
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,916
Good day, sir.

26
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,957
Baines.

27
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,298
Baines!

28
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,311
- One of her moods again.
- Always some grouse.

29
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,651
Not healthy to be as clean as all that.

30
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,920
You be careful, sonny.
Mrs. Baines is on the warpath again.

31
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,825
<i>Anyway, these foreigners like a bit of dirt.</i>

32
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,229
<i> Poor kid. Be a good thing</i>
<i>for him when his mother gets back.</i>

33
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,037
Master Phillipe,just because
your father's away for a couple of days...

34
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,504
you mustn't think
you can run wild all over the house.

35
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,701
- No, Mrs. Baines.
- I've got plenty to do without clearing up after you.

36
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,301
What's that you've got in your hand?
Show me. What is it?

37
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,313
Piece of chalk.

38
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,383
You've been making marks
all over the floor again?

39
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,419
- <i>Well? Have you?</i>
- Just little marks.

40
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,284
Give me the chalk.
Come on. Give it to me.

41
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,585
Have you done what
I told you to do, Master Phillipe?

42
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,922
Done what?

43
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,087
- <i>Got rid of it.</i>
- Yes.

44
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,496
You know what happens
to little boys who tell lies?

45
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,035
I won't have any vermin
in any house I run.

46
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,765
Did you put it where I told you to?
Down the lavatory?

47
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,502
- <i>Did you? Answer me. Did you?</i>
- Yes.

48
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,670
What are you hiding in your pockets?

49
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,873
<i>Bring your hand out.</i>
<i>Show me. Come along.</i>

50
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,816
Only toffees.

51
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,752
I won't have you eating between meals,
Master Phillipe. Give them to me.

52
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,915
You need a mother's care.
I've tried to do it for months.

53
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,517
Is that all you've got? Run along,
and try and not get into mischief.

54
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,893
It's difficult enough
with half the staff away.

55
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,499
- See you on Monday, Mr. Baines.
- Have a good weekend, Harry.

56
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,471
Get out of it.

57
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,473
Can't you see I'm busy?

58
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,805
<i>Can't you pick on someone else?</i>

59
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,142
Well, since you are here,
you might as well do a job of work.

60
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,682
- Get on with that.
- Look. Macgregor.

61
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,946
Oh. Hmm.

62
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,954
Looking well this morning, isn't he?

63
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,547
- Have you got a little box for him?
- Little box?

64
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:44,552
- Hmm. Might find something.
- Will you take me for a walk this afternoon, Baines?

65
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,828
<i>Well, I might, if you work hard enough.</i>
<i>I might. We'll see.</i>

66
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,903
Quite a lot to be done.

67
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,403
This is exciting -
your mother coming back- isn't it?

68
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,669
Yes, but, you know,
I don't remember her very well.

69
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,803
<i>Have a glass of pop, Phile. Spot of drink</i>
<i>will do us good. Give us an appetite for dinner.</i>

70
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,814
- I am having my meals down here, aren't I?
- Of course.

71
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,510
- What have you got for chop?
- Chop?

72
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,713
You said that was
what food was called in Africa.

73
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,258
- Oh, yes, of course. Chop.
- Tell me more about Africa.

74
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,787
- Another time.
- Was is it hot there?

75
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,832
You never felt such heat.
Not - Not even where you come from.

76
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,391
Not a nice heat, mind you,
like you get in the park on a day like this.

77
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,405
The white man's grave, they call it.

78
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,340
Wet. Smelling of rot.

79
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,877
- What does rot smell of?
- Eh?

80
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,106
Oh, the opposite to this.

81
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,775
I smell that carbolic stuff.

82
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,082
When there's nothing
but carbolic round you hanker after rot.

83
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,349
Mmm. I understand.

84
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,687
- Hmm.
- It reeks of chains.

85
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,692
Yes. Hmm.

86
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,628
- It's a man's life out there, Phile.
- But why did you leave Africa?

87
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,099
Why? Oh, um,
get married, you know.

88
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,727
Wasn't there anybody to marry
out there in Africa?

89
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,136
Oh, yes. Plenty.
But they weren't white.

90
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,038
- Must they be white?
- Um - Hmm.

91
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,441
<i>Ah, Mrs. Patterson.</i>
<i>What are you doing with those?</i>

92
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,538
- Mrs. Baines told us to fill 'em.
- Where's Dolly and the others?

93
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,585
The weekend off. The place is empty except for
Mrs. Baines, Phile and me. We carry on.

94
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,985
- <i>Phile, drink up the pop and lend a hand with this.</i>
- <i>Don't overwork him, Mr. Baines.</i>

95
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,989
Got to make a living like everybody else.

96
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,991
- Does everybody make a living?
- Everybody.

97
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,789
- Even Papa?
- Just a slave really.

98
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,457
- <i>Not an easy life like us.</i>
- Can you make a living in Africa?

99
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,730
<i> Make a living?</i>
<i>You can make a fortune. Make anything you like.</i>

100
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,736
<i>Make elephants and kings and castles.</i>

101
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,636
Yes. And shoot 'em too.

102
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,574
- If they don't get you.
- Can I show her the gun?

103
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,670
<i>Don't you dare. Leave it where it is.</i>

104
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,306
It's not loaded,
and Baines keeps the safety catch on.

105
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,078
Leave it be, Phile.

106
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,120
- It's got bullets too!
- Phile -

107
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,691
<i>Phile.</i>

108
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,958
<i>So there you are.</i>
<i>Holding up the work again?</i>

109
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,659
- There's still plenty to do.
- We'll get it finished.

110
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,430
- By sitting around here all day long?
- Good morning, Mr. Baines. Till Monday.

111
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,166
- Ta, ta.
- No business to keep that gun in the house.

112
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,209
Come along, Master Phillipe.
Sit down there. Get on to that salad.

113
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,778
Baines is going to take me
for a walk this afternoon.

114
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,938
No, he isn't.
Not with all this work to do.

115
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,016
- There'll be time enough for both.
- Oh, please.

116
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,517
Work first,
and pleasure afterwards.

117
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,415
Easy to see you've been eating
between meals, Master Phillipe.

118
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,656
- I'm sick to death of your ways, spoiling the boy.
- He didn't. I took it.

119
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,097
- Lying again, Master Phillipe?
- There's lies and lies.

120
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,965
- What do you mean by that?
- Some lies are just kindness.

121
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,038
Kindness?

122
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,108
Temper, temper. I won't have you
swearing in front of the boy.

123
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,804
- Do go on, Master Phillipe. What are you waiting for?
- I don't want any.

124
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,109
Master Phillipe, do as you're told
and eat it up. Go along.

125
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,141
Why don't you let Baines
take me for a walk?

126
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,243
Because I say so.

127
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,889
I hate you.

128
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,222
Master Phillipe,
you'll say you're sorry for that.

129
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,832
I'm not sorry.

130
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,371
Very well. Go straight upstairs to the nursery,
and you'll stay there for the whole afternoon.

131
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,236
Do you hear me?
Go along. Up, up, up!

132
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,819
<i>Get along with you. Go along.</i>

133
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,888
I don't care.

134
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,376
Hello, Macgregor.

135
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,747
Look. You're very pretty, you know.

136
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,465
<i>Baines.!</i>

137
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,133
Baines!

138
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,749
Quick. Come on, Macgregor.

139
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,877
I got you.

140
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,467
Ah!

141
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,480
- Baines!
- Mustn't come in here, sonny.

142
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,521
- Isn't Mr. Baines here?
- No. Hasn't been in here yet.

143
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,290
Baines!

144
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,026
Phile.

145
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:26,291
- What are you doing here?
- I saw you through the window.

146
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,967
Are you by yourself?

147
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,969
Yes.

148
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,240
You gave me a start.

149
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,642
- I thought it would be funny.
- Yes. It's funny. Of course it's funny.

150
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,715
- Phile, this is Julie.
- How do you do?

151
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,050
Have a bun.

152
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,954
He spells his name queer.
P- H-I-L-E. Phile.

153
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,762
Oh, she - she hasn't got an appetite, isn't eating.
You can have both of them.

154
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,828
You don't need to take any notice of us.

155
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,804
- Got a glass of milk?
- <i> I think I've got a drop.</i>

156
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,875
Well, go and get it, Phile.

157
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,412
I wish I were dead.

158
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,992
It wouldn't work.

159
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,522
There are things have got to be said.

160
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,863
If you'd like another cake, you can
go to the counter and change it, Phile.

161
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,596
No.

162
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,434
This is how I see it,Julie.

163
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,341
This, uh, girl you're talking about.
This, uh -

164
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,379
This friend of yours.

165
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:54,284
<i>She-She... likes the fellow,</i>
<i>doesn't she?</i>

166
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,354
<i>It's real, I mean?</i>

167
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,158
<i>L 'amour?</i>

168
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,227
<i>L 'amour éternel.</i>

169
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,663
The things you say,Julie.

170
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,563
<i>The way you put things.</i>

171
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,660
What I mean is you...

172
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,864
can't break a thing like that.

173
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:20,169
Not just by going away,
leaving no trace, going home.

174
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,611
She wouldn't be going home.

175
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,015
- Home is here.
- Her own country I mean.

176
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,088
Wouldn't work,Julie.

177
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,655
There'd be her,
as it were you, and...

178
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,285
him, as it were me...

179
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,525
and all that distance between them.

180
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,666
Like this table.

181
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,738
It wouldn't work.

182
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,507
He'd go crazy,Julie...

183
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,203
<i>hoping every time the post came.</i>

184
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,573
Not being able to write.

185
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,650
Oh, he'd - he'd forget.

186
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,651
There wouldn't be much to remember.

187
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:05,417
For seven months, ever since she came
to the embassy, seeing her every day-

188
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,357
Not speaking because of
people looking on.

189
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,394
Like this.

190
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,431
Give it - Give it time,Julie.

191
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,968
- But it's torture.
- What's torture?

192
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,908
- What's he say?
- He says he's had pain too. It soon goes.

193
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:37,353
But this... girlfriend of yours,Julie.
She doesn't have to go away.

194
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,051
- While there's life there's hope.
- There's always hope.

195
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,219
Things happen. Things change.

196
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,764
People don't change. He's tied.

197
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,993
She wouldn't like him so much
if he didn't feel tied.

198
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,002
I can't believe it.

199
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,733
- I can't believe we'll go out of here
and say good-bye and never-
- Careful.

200
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,281
Have you got a handkerchief?

201
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,681
No.

202
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,277
No. Have you got one, Phile?
She's got something in her eye.

203
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,953
- Mine's clean.
- Well, let her have it, Phile.

204
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,496
Pull the top bit over the other one.
That's what I always do.

205
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:23,694
There -There's nothing
fixed yet, is there?

206
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,793
The -The boat I mean.

207
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,872
- The day after tomorrow.
- Monday?

208
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,534
Can I have this one too
if you don't want it?

209
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:40,951
They couldn't stand it forever,
meeting in tea shops and cinemas.

210
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,351
All the difficulties and lies.

211
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,720
- He's not that kind of man.
- What kind of man is he?

212
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,218
Good and kind.

213
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,560
- Can't hurt anyone.
- What a fool the man is.

214
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,463
That's what I think too.

215
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,674
- Here's your handkerchief, Phillipe.
- I've got to see you tomorrow,Julie.

216
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,901
It's no good.
You've got to take him home now.

217
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,877
Listen. I'll ring you somehow.
There's so much I have to say.

218
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,915
It's all been said over and over again.

219
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,678
- Good-bye.
- I don't know what to do.

220
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,253
You don't need to do anything.

221
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,323
Nothing.

222
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,759
She does make a fuss
about her friend, doesn't she?

223
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,604
<i>Can I have some tea in my milk?</i>

224
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,679
It's sad about her friend, isn't it?

225
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,180
Is Julie your niece or something?

226
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,727
- How much is that, please?
- One and eight pence.

227
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,310
The cup that cheers.

228
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,708
Come on, Phile.

229
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,712
-
- I'm sorry I gave you a start.

230
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,223
That's all right, Phile.

231
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:35,133
- Is that car a Ford?
- I didn't see.

232
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,498
Oh, look.
There's your niece again.

233
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,577
Look. I'll speak to her tonight.

234
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,279
I'll say to her, "What's the use?
You and I don't get on anymore."

235
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,448
<i>And then I'll tell her everything.</i>
<i>Perhaps she'll see it.</i>

236
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,458
She'll never let you go.

237
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,190
She might. Anyway, we've one last day.
I must see you tomorrow.Just the last time.

238
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,266
<i>I'll telephone you.</i>

239
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,933
- <i>Promise?</i>
- <i> Baines, it is a Ford.</i>

240
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,875
I promise.

241
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,967
Oh, look.
There's Mrs. Baines on the balcony.

242
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,701
Need we go in yet?

243
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,709
Listen, Phile. I -

244
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,645
I don't want you -

245
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,114
I don't ask you to say
what isn't true, but...

246
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,153
there's no need to mention
to Mrs. Baines that you metJulie.

247
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,952
- Is it a secret?
- That's right, Phile. Our secret.

248
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,518
You see, Mrs. Baines -
She - She doesn't likeJulie.

249
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,260
It was stupid of me to meet her so near home,
but I'd got to see she was all right.

250
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,859
Of course you had.
You can trust me, Baines.

251
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,598
Mrs. Baines'll get it out of you
if she can.

252
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,505
Oh, I'll never let you down, Baines.

253
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,670
Funny, isn't it? Julie working for the embassy
and all this time she was your niece.

254
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,509
Yes. It's a scream.

255
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,982
Need we go in yet?

256
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,249
- Come on, Phile.
- Take me for a walk in the park.

257
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,551
Here. Phile.

258
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,525
Give me your handkerchief.

259
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,857
It's things like that give secrets away.

260
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,297
Isn't it exciting, Baines?

261
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,301
Good night, Macgregor.

262
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,245
Bonsoir.

263
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,563
Oh. What are you doing?

264
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,894
Just looking.

265
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,491
- <i>What at?</i>
- Nothing.

266
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,595
I suppose you were doing nothing
this afternoon -you and Mr. Baines.

267
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,106
- <i>Well?</i>
- No.

268
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,904
We'll see about that later.

269
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,174
<i>Come along now.</i>
<i>Off you go.</i>

270
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,476
I've got work to do. Come on.

271
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,148
Now what are you waiting for?
You can see I'm busy, can't you?

272
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,692
Get along with you. Downstairs.
Hurry up.

273
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,186
Come down from there!
Get down at once!

274
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,189
<i>No. No, don't.</i>
<i>No. You wait. Wait, wait, wait.</i>

275
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,226
Master Phillipe,
come away from there at once.

276
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,822
Do I have to come and drag you away?

277
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,165
Right. Come here.
Do you hear me? Give me your hands.

278
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,973
Oh, now look what you've done.

279
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,637
And all over my shoes.
Dirt. Nothing but dirt.

280
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:46,547
No. No. No, you don't. It stays there.
Stay there for your mother to see.

281
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,881
Show her the sort of tricks
you get up to.

282
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,979
- Get along. Don't ever let me find you on there again.
- I'm sorry.

283
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,821
Just for that, you shall have your supper in
the nursery. Your tray's downstairs. Go fetch it.

284
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,895
- I'm sorry.
- And no more chatting with Baines.

285
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,658
Take your tray and go straight upstairs.
I'll fetch it later.

286
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,918
She knows we were out,
but I haven't told her a thing.

287
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,146
Just slip along upstairs now, Phile.

288
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,588
She told me to fetch my tray.
I've got to have it upstairs.

289
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,682
There it is.

290
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,660
I put Macgregor to bed.
She nearly caught me.

291
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,391
Phile, I'd say I'm sorry about it.

292
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,831
- You know. Lunchtime.
- Hmm.

293
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,803
If my mother does come back on Monday,
it won't make any difference to us, will it?

294
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,874
Not a bit.

295
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,490
I'm sorry I said I hated you.

296
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,559
It's all right.

297
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,160
<i>I said you weren't to take him out.</i>

298
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,963
<i>I didn't take him out. I brought him home.</i>

299
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,766
You went out by the back door...

300
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,809
he by the fire escape,
and you two met outside.

301
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,606
Phile's been out on his own.
So have I.

302
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,079
I told him he wasn't to go out,
and you take him.

303
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,480
<i>Oh, don't let's talk about him.</i>

304
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,386
- <i>There's something more important.</i>
- What could that be?

305
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,456
You and I.

306
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,394
Go on.

307
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,695
Well, I've tried to make a go of it.

308
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,893
And so have you.

309
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,903
But we only make each other miserable.

310
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,338
It's years now since there's been a day
without some blessed row.

311
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,744
- <i>We can't go on like this.</i>
- You want your freedom?

312
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,348
You don't want me around anymore.

313
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,045
This is something new,
this kind of talk.

314
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,121
I've thought about it long enough.

315
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,053
- And now it's time tell you. Because -
- You go off, and see what happens to me.

316
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:14,495
- <i> Oh, don't talk like that.</i>
- <i> You do as you say.</i>
<i>You and your freedom.</i>

317
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,397
<i>You'll feel fine when you read it</i>
<i>in the Sunday newspapers.</i>

318
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,994
<i>You'll be able to say, "That's me. I did that. '"</i>
<i>That'll make you feel happy.</i>

319
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,074
Oh, don't talk so foolish.

320
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,871
Oh, go and give the boy his supper.

321
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,879
We'll talk about it later.

322
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,580
You know your father
doesn't like you going out alone.

323
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,151
- Funny you should meet Baines, wasn't it?
- Yes.

324
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,924
He likes wandering about
on his own too.

325
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,866
- Not much appetite, have you, Master Phillipe?
- No, Mrs. Baines.

326
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,336
Why don't you try eating some of that
nice pudding? You don't eat enough.

327
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,272
Don't eat enough to keep a fly alive.
No lunch and -

328
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,606
and now no supper, Master Phillipe.

329
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,281
So that's why you've lost your appetite,
Master Phillipe.

330
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,478
Been eating between meals.
Buying cream buns again.

331
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,078
- That's not what your pocket money is for.
- I didn't.

332
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,092
Don't lie to me, Master Phillipe. You're going to be
a fine worry to your mother when I tell her.

333
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,129
I will not put up with any more lies.
You're becoming a regular little liar!

334
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,063
- I won't put up with any more lies from you!
- They gave it to me!

335
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,533
- They?
- Baines I mean.

336
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,572
"They."

337
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,111
Oh.

338
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,778
So that's it.

339
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,016
Yes.

340
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,227
You mustn't mind Mrs. Baines,
Master Phillipe.

341
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,322
<i>She, um-She lets her tongue</i>
<i>run away with her.</i>

342
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,730
We have a secret now...

343
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,170
you and I...

344
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,071
that I know all about them.

345
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,076
Can you keep a secret?

346
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,646
- Yes.
- Good.

347
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,113
I suppose she was having tea with him.

348
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,347
Just tea. No cakes.

349
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,289
Is she young?

350
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,087
Of course. She's his niece.

351
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,128
So that's what he said.

352
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,130
The old scoundrel.

353
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:31,396
It's all right. She's not seeing him anymore.
Tomorrow she's going away.

354
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,836
Is she? Tomorrow.

355
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,935
You can keep our secret now?
Hmm? Yes?

356
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,012
Yes.

357
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,350
You do, and I'll get you
that 2A Meccano set.

358
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,637
Do you want the light up there?

359
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,839
He hasn't eaten his supper.
Think he'd be hungry after his long walk.

360
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,040
Wait till I put on the light.

361
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,552
I don't think I want to go on
with our talk tonight, if you don't mind.

362
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,247
You know when you two
were out this afternoon?

363
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,327
- What? Me and Phile?
- Yes.

364
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,955
I thought to myself,
"Perhaps I stay indoors too much.

365
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,863
I ought to get out more,
take some time off."

366
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:40,802
- I've been telling you that for weeks.
- Yes. So you have.

367
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,840
I think it might be a very good idea.

368
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,257
<i>You asleep, Phile?</i>

369
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:38,085
Come on, Phile. Time to wake up.

370
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,221
<i>Come on, Phile. Up you get.</i>

371
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,166
Where's Mrs. Baines?

372
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:48,137
- She's gone to see her Aunt Hilda.
- No. Why?

373
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,107
Said she needed an outing, Phile.
Like you and me.

374
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,169
- When will she come back?
- <i>Not until tomorrow morning.</i>

375
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,844
- Are we really alone?
- Of course we are.
We're going to spend the day together.

376
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,285
- Will we be alone all day, Baines?
- We'll be together, Phile.

377
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,357
It's misty still.

378
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,327
The cat's been out all night.
There she is, sniffing round the railings.

379
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,659
<i>There's Doris shaking the mats out.</i>

380
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,165
<i>It's a great life if you don't weaken.</i>

381
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,134
- It's early, isn't it?
- It's going to be a long day, Phile.

382
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,637
Now, you get dressed,
and I'll be cooking the sausages.

383
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,871
<i>Yes. To see her aunt.</i>

384
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,707
<i>I'm quite alone,you understand?</i>

385
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:32,010
<i>No. Not about that. No.</i>
<i>I'll explain it all.</i>

386
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,648
Oh, you must come.
You promised you would.

387
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,653
We'll have the whole day together.

388
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,622
<i>Oh, it makes no difference</i>
<i>about the boy.</i>

389
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,455
<i>Yes. Uh, back here to supper,Julie.</i>

390
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,657
Ah, of course it's safe. I -Well, I'm so
looking forward to seeing you,Julie.

391
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,665
<i>I must talk to you.</i>

392
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,499
<i>I'll</i>- <i>I'll wait for you.</i>
<i>Of course I'll wait for you.</i>

393
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,165
<i>It'll amuse the boy,</i>
<i>and we'll be able to talk.</i>

394
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,175
No. Of course he doesn't understand.

395
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,144
3:00, and we'll be able to talk quietly.

396
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,481
<i>I'd rather see the snakes, Baines.</i>

397
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:17,049
I was sure you'd like the lions.
My old legs are getting tired.

398
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,528
- You're not so old, Baines.
- I'm not so young as I used to be.

399
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,963
I'll tell you what.
Let's sit down over there.

400
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,332
I'll tell you things.
Then we'll go to the reptile house.

401
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,440
Did you shoot lions in Africa?

402
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,408
Oh,just a few. I mostly let them live.

403
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,607
- You shot a man though, Baines.
- Who told you that?

404
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,910
You did.
You murdered him, you said.

405
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,078
Murdered?
I never murdered anyone.

406
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,987
You said you killed someone,
once in Africa with that gun.

407
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,494
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, well, that wasn't murder, Phile.
That was self-defense.

408
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,531
You see, one day the blackies planned
what they call a rising.

409
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,396
I was the only white man
for miles around.

410
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,938
Well, this chap -
He called himself a king.

411
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,031
He got the blackies properly
worked up, speechifying.

412
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,042
They-

413
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,078
<i>Yes? Go on. Go on.</i>

414
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,909
Uh, th-they all came up to my hut.

415
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,280
Hundreds of them.
Knives, spears, clubs.

416
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,912
- Well, all I had was that - that gun I showed you.
- Go on.

417
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:22,083
"Clear off," I said to that king of theirs.
"Hop it," I said.

418
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,855
But he was after my blood.

419
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,362
Well, if they'd got me,
it wouldn't have ended there.

420
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,729
They'd have tasted blood.

421
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,496
- <i>Like those lions there.</i>
- Th-Then what happened?

422
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:37,600
Oh, I plugged him. Then I threw the gun away
and went in with my fists.

423
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,767
But you found the gun again.

424
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,177
Oh, yeah. Yes. So I did.
I'll tell you about that one day.

425
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,740
I wish I could
go away with you to Africa.

426
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,321
Oh, look. There's your niece.

427
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,987
Oh, yes. So it is.

428
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,531
Now can we go and see
the reptile house?

429
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,834
- Look. Would you like an ice cream, Phile?
- I wouldn't say no, Baines.

430
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,202
Well, here's a bob. Get one forJulie too.
There you are. Over there.

431
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,536
What did she -

432
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,942
- Did you tell her?
- No.

433
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,782
I couldn't get around to it somehow.
And then she went away.

434
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,876
- Two wafers, please.
- Two wafers.

435
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,117
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

436
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:35,859
- Then everything's just the same.
- Give me time. I'll manage it somehow.

437
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,958
- There's your ice cream.
- Thank you, Phillipe.

438
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,435
I've been telling Julie
she's gotta have supper with us.

439
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,234
But you asked on the telephone,
and she said she would.

440
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,401
- The things you know.
- It would only be worse afterwards.

441
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,873
She doesn't trust my cooking, Phile.

442
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:54,350
- Oh, can't we see the snakes, Baines?
- Of course we're going to see the snakes.

443
00:35:56,587 --> 00:36:00,023
Hello, polly.
I'd like to find a snake like Macgregor.

444
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,592
- Who's Macgregor?
- It's a secret.

445
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,888
We don't need to have secrets from Julie.

446
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,863
Are you scared to come back home?

447
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,559
- Scared of what?
- Mrs. Baines.

448
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,694
Look, Phile. There -
There's the reptile house. Over there.

449
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,613
<i>Ah. You are pretty.</i>

450
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,546
- What time's the boat train?
- 9:00.

451
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,386
Can you get food on the train?

452
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,656
I'm taking sandwiches.

453
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,535
Newhaven - Dieppe?

454
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,603
Dover - Calais.

455
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,075
Have you packed?

456
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,076
Of course I have.

457
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,078
Oh, stop looking after me.

458
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,408
Oh, dear.

459
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,610
<i>Baines.</i>

460
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,553
- Do come and have a look at the snake.
- Is it as nice as Macgregor?

461
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,648
- Oh, you've told her.
- I said we don't have secrets from Julie.

462
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,956
- I do.
- Macgregor wouldn't be frightened of me, would he?

463
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,930
There's only one person
in the whole world he's frightened of.

464
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,227
- <i> And who's that?</i>
- Mrs. Baines.

465
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,304
Baines!

466
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,969
Baines!

467
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,349
Oh, look, Baines.
Come and look at this.

468
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,684
<i>Baines.! What are they doing?</i>

469
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,456
Here.

470
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,214
Where's Phile?

471
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,977
- Oh. There he is.
- <i>Phile.!</i>

472
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,882
Time to be off.
She's coming back, Phile.

473
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,117
We'll all three have supper together.

474
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,753
Wouldn't Mrs. Baines be angry if she knew!

475
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,965
- Suppose she came back after all?
- She won't do that. Not when her mind's made up.

476
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,939
She - She doesn't know
about yesterday, does she?

477
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,011
No. Phile's a wonder for secrets.

478
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,980
- Is it very important to keep secrets?
- It certainly is.

479
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:44,077
- Even if you don't like the person?
- That makes no difference.

480
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,884
Even Mrs. Baines's secrets?

481
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,753
Yes, Phillipe.
Even Mrs. Baines's secrets.

482
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,609
I'll just go and open up.

483
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,185
This is a "man's hole." You can get
right down to the sewers through here.

484
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,126
- You're very fond of Baines, aren't you, Phillipe?
- Of course.

485
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,129
But you don't like girls.

486
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,631
Baines doesn't either. Not really.

487
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,669
Come in, you two.

488
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,364
Telegram! Telegram!
Can I open it?

489
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,373
If you like.

490
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,434
This is our kitchenette.

491
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,910
Handy for getting a cup of tea.

492
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,981
<i>It's from Mrs. Baines.</i>

493
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,257
<i>Her aunt's not well.</i>

494
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,383
She won't be back for a day or two.

495
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,792
Do you think it's true?

496
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,957
True? Why, yes. Of course it's true.
She wouldn't say it if it wasn't. Would she?

497
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,969
Does Mrs. Baines keep secrets?

498
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,039
<i>We don't want to waste</i>
<i>good time cooking.</i>

499
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,608
Got plenty of tins.
What we want's a good spread...

500
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,143
<i>and every man his own drink.</i>

501
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,078
<i> How long does</i>
<i>a telegram take to get to a place?</i>

502
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,115
<i>Depends where it comes from.</i>

503
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,844
<i>I'm going to make a dart of this one.</i>

504
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,045
<i>Move along now, Phile. Move along.</i>

505
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,249
- <i> Do telegrams cost much?</i>
- <i> Oh, don't natter.</i>

506
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,826
Couldn't we eat out here?

507
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:35,398
<i>We could easily make a...</i>
<i>table out of some of the cases.</i>

508
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,025
- Don't you think?
- Yes. Of course.

509
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,970
- It would be a picnic.
- Oh, must we have a picnic?

510
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:47,305
- Well, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Can I feed Macgregor first?

511
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,743
Of course you can,
while I'm taking out the things.

512
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,815
- Can I come too, Phillipe?
- Show her Macgregor.

513
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,150
Mmm. But won't you need me here?

514
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,483
Oh, I think I can manage.

515
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,784
Mrs. Baines doesn't like Macgregor.

516
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,794
- She doesn't, huh?
- She doesn't like you either.

517
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,990
What do you mean? Phile.

518
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,033
<i>What do you mean she doesn't like me?</i>

519
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,161
She doesn't like anybody really.
But Baines doesn't like her.

520
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:18,367
- How do you know?
- She won't give him his... freedom.

521
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:24,110
- <i>Did he ask her?</i>
- Oh, yes. I heard him. But I didn't mean to listen.

522
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,445
No, no. I'm - I'm sure you didn't.

523
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,213
- When was this?
- Yesterday after Baines and I came back.

524
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,451
- <i>What did he say, Phile?</i>
- "I want my freedom."Just like that.

525
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,016
And she went on. Natter, natter.
Always nattering.

526
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:41,097
<i>Poor Baines.</i>
<i>He did want it so badly.</i>

527
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:44,031
<i>When she comes back</i>
<i>I'll ask her for my freedom too.</i>

528
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,263
That was a good dart.
Why did you throw it away?

529
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,397
Oh, I can make lots more like that.

530
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,773
- What room is this?
- The guest room.

531
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,437
For very important people.

532
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,108
- <i>Oh. It's very pretty.</i>
- Macgregor lives here.

533
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,185
Supper.

534
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,084
- What's the matter?
- He's gone.

535
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,722
How could he have got out?

536
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,958
She must have killed him.

537
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,372
It's just a bit of bad luck you've got to take.

538
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,739
She never really liked him.

539
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,779
- She said he was vermin.
- Well, tomorrow we'll -

540
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,905
we'll put up a little stone
in the garden...

541
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,916
and we'll write his name on it.

542
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,955
"Macgregor, killed by Mrs. Baines."

543
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,820
- And the date.
- No, no. No. Not that.

544
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,826
Something like...

545
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:47,887
"My Macgregor.
Very lovely he was in his life."

546
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,489
And then the date.

547
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:55,163
No. We -We'll just have "Macgregor."

548
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,298
That'll be plenty.
We'll remember.

549
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,740
How about a bite of supper?
Then we'll play a game.

550
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,281
Come on.

551
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:10,820
Well, sit down,Julie.
Let's - Let's have a drink to happier days.

552
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,821
Let me.

553
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,825
- Hey!
- Hey!

554
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:57,593
There he is. What is it? I've caught a fish?
Is it a rabbit or a roly-poly pudding?

555
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,703
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

556
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,803
We'll catch him this time.
We'll catch him and kill him.

557
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,348
<i>Puss, puss, puss, puss,</i>
<i>puss, puss, puss, puss.</i>

558
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:49,016
Thunder and lightning! Lightning and thunder!
Terrible storm in the jungle now.

559
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,886
I catch - I catch - I catch you.

560
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,686
Oh, what a run.

561
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,899
<i>Where is he? Phile? Bedtime.</i>

562
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,266
- Come along.
- Phillipe.

563
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,271
Think he went along here.

564
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,672
Come on. Come on.
Where are you?

565
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,837
- Phillipe.
- No?

566
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,023
I'm only going because -

567
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,560
because it's not possible to stay.

568
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,825
All day long I've wanted
to talk to you,Julie.

569
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:38,561
Now's my last chance.
Now we're alone, I just want -

570
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,400
I just want you around always.

571
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,102
- Baines.
- <i> What is it?</i>

572
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,204
- What's the matter?
- I saw -

573
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,079
What frightened you?

574
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,152
I'm - I thought I saw a ghost.

575
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,313
Aw.

576
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,620
The game's gone on too long.
Come on. Upstairs.

577
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,604
Where are they?

578
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,372
<i>Where are they?</i>

579
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,644
Don't lie to me.

580
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,845
<i>I know they're here.</i>

581
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,549
I have been here all the time.

582
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,853
That's not nice, Master Phillipe.

583
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,727
All I want to know is where they are.

584
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,063
I want -

585
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:49,162
I want to talk to them.
Help me. Help Mrs. Baines.

586
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,538
Master Phillipe, we -we've always
been friends, haven't we?

587
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,304
No.

588
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,539
We were friends, last night.

589
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,344
Do you remember that secret we had?
About them?

590
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,146
We didn't have a secret.

591
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,055
Oh, you know all about them.

592
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,423
You're not such a child
as you pretend to be.

593
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:15,089
You've got a nasty, wicked mind,
and it ought to be beaten out of you.

594
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:56,268
Phile? Phile?
Is that you?

595
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,412
Baines!

596
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,482
<i>Look.!</i>

597
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:13,052
<i>Help.! Help.!</i>

598
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,226
She's in there!
You've got that girl in there!

599
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,093
- <i>Now, wait a moment. Listen to me.</i>
- <i>I don't want to hear any excuses.</i>

600
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,100
<i>I know all about it. Let me get at her.</i>
<i>I'll tell her a thing or two.!</i>

601
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:28,103
We can say what we've got to say to
each other downstairs. Don't make a scene.

602
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:31,106
Get out of my way!
Don't you tell me what to do!

603
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,234
You're a fine one to dictate to me!
How dare you! Let me go!

604
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,812
I'll put you and her in the gutter
before I'm finished with you!

605
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,111
I'll give you something you'll remember
for the rest of your life!

606
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,185
Will you let me go!

607
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:47,119
<i>Thought you had me safely out of the way,</i>
<i>didn't you? Hypocrite.!</i>

608
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:50,284
<i>And you.! You needn't go on</i>
<i>hiding in that room.! I recognized you.!</i>

609
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,886
<i>You needn't think you can come back here</i>
<i>on Monday to your safe littlejob.!</i>

610
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,898
- <i>I'll get you deported out of the country.!</i>
- <i> Quiet.!</i>

611
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,094
<i>For heaven's sake,</i>
<i>don't go on like this.!</i>

612
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,104
If you've no thought of yourself or of me,
at least think of the boy.

613
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,539
- Him? When I'm finished with her,
I'll give him what he deserves!
- Be quiet!

614
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:10,272
<i>He'll think twice before he starts on his</i>
<i>sneaking ways, the lying, beastly little brat.!</i>

615
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,178
- Stop, or I'll lose my temper!
-

616
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,945
Now, you go downstairs.

617
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,456
I'll join you, and we'll -

618
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,895
He pushed her.

619
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,353
Hello, sonny.

620
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,147
What are you up to?

621
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:40,160
Out a bit late, aren't you, sonny?

622
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,990
What's your name, sonny?

623
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,030
Come here.

624
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,540
<i>Here.</i>

625
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,153
Cold, sonny?

626
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,620
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Put this on.</i>

627
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,625
How about
a nice, warm cup of tea?

628
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,961
<i>Yes?</i>

629
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,160
<i>You would? Good.</i>

630
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:22,971
Come on.

631
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,303
<i>Yes?</i>

632
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,913
Well, I'm going to have one anyway.

633
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,062
- Yes?
- And so I arrested her.

634
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,826
Well, Rose, what have you
got to say this time?

635
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,026
Nothing,
except it's not my turn yet.

636
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,103
Same address?

637
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,640
There we are.

638
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,667
- Now, round here. Come on.
- <i>Come here.</i>

639
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,871
Bring him here.

640
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,777
<i>Who is he?</i>

641
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,941
What's all this about?

642
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:10,349
I found him wandering about.

643
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:14,150
- Pickin' up kids now, are ya?
- Quiet, Rose.

644
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,157
Where do you live, sonny?

645
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:19,160
- He won't speak.
- Quite right.

646
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:22,163
Come on, sonny.
You come over here.

647
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:26,133
So, what have you been up to, eh?
Playing about, have you?

648
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,296
<i>Come and sit over here.</i>
<i>There you are.</i>

649
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:32,603
Now, then, what were you doing?

650
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,906
- Walking in your sleep, were you?
- That's all <i>I</i> was doing.

651
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,913
Remember where you live, sonny? Eh?

652
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,210
Come on. Try to think.

653
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:44,219
Come on, sonny.
There's nothing to be frightened of here.

654
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:45,982
Nothin' at all.

655
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,989
Shh. Shh.

656
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,991
We just want to help you, see.

657
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:53,062
You tell us where you live,
and we'll take you home.

658
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,136
<i>Come on, sonny.</i>
<i>Tell us where you live.</i>

659
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,578
See what you can do, Rose.

660
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,278
- Hello, deary. Where do you live?
- Rose, Rose.

661
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,976
- Not like that.
- Not like what?

662
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,280
- Well -
- Here! Not like what?

663
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:23,292
You know.Just find out where he lives
and tell him we'll take him there.

664
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,953
- Shall I take you home?
- Rose!

665
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,589
Can't you do it without -
without the smile?

666
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,599
Just ask him naturally.

667
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,101
Naturally?

668
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,104
Come along, deary.

669
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,607
Now, you would like to come home
with me now, deary, wouldn't you?

670
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,836
That was all right, wasn't it?

671
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,379
<i>Well, I can't say it any other way.!</i>

672
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,574
- Now, you would, wouldn't you?
- Yes, please.

673
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,811
There you are. You see?

674
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,012
Station officer, Chelsea Police.

675
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,090
Yes, Doctor?

676
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,285
Serious? Fatal.

677
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,956
Come and sit over here.
Come on.

678
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,965
Tell me your name.

679
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,035
What time was that?

680
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,340
- Now then, come on. Tell me your name.
- <i>Yes, Doctor. Of course.</i>

681
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,568
<i>What's the matter?</i>

682
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,577
<i>Come on.</i>

683
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,806
Phillipe.

684
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,849
Phillipe? Phillipe what?

685
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,544
- <i> Yes.</i>
- That's all.

686
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,712
Come on.

687
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,053
It's a bit long, isn't it?
You want a haircut.

688
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,822
I'll have one sent over.
Anything else I can do?

689
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:36,330
Phillipe? Phillipe what, eh?
Where do you live?

690
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,833
Come on, chum.
You pop your feet into these.

691
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:41,563
Oh! Aren't you a lucky boy!

692
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,504
Oh, look.
They'd last forever.

693
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:47,269
- <i> I'd like a pair of those.</i>
- Good night, Doctor.

694
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,345
Jones.

695
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:57,013
There's been an accident - 48 Cheston Square.
You know, that embassy.

696
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,021
Woman killed herself.
Fell down a flight of stairs.

697
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,957
Get an ambulance sent over.
Ask for Mr. Baines.

698
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,153
Is it too hot? Is it?

699
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,530
Here, try it now. Go on.

700
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:14,694
- Now, Rose, have you got the address?
- Give me time.

701
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:18,262
- Did you say the name was Baines?
- Uh, yes, Baines. 48 Cheston Square.

702
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,077
Baines.

703
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,703
What's the matter?

704
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,714
Do you know him?

705
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,250
I live there.

706
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,718
What made you run away, sonny?

707
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:35,487
Nothing.

708
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,390
You weren't frightened or anything?

709
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,597
No.

710
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,463
Then everything
was all right at home?

711
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,128
Yes.

712
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,333
Does your father
work at the embassy?

713
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,778
No. He's ambassador.

714
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,347
Oh!

715
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,417
I know your daddy!

716
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,172
Oh, there you are, Phile.

717
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,175
We picked him up in Hilton Street.

718
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,177
There's been an accident?

719
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,179
Yes.

720
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,250
- Over there?
- The doctor's with her now.

721
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,978
Now...

722
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,055
just -

723
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,522
just -just sit down there...

724
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,593
for a moment, Phile.

725
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:50,064
- How did it happen?
- We'd had a few words up there.

726
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,567
She was angry with the boy
for some reason.

727
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,968
The next thing I knew...

728
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,199
she'd slipped going down the stairs.

729
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,368
- Can I help at all, sir?
- No.Just an accident.

730
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:11,046
I'll be off. There's nothing more that I can do.
You better tell the ambassador at once.

731
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:15,056
He's away.
I've phoned the first secretary.

732
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,558
Don't worry, man.
More than you can help.

733
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,561
You did all that you could.
These things happen, you know.

734
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,063
- I can't believe that she's -
- I know.

735
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,567
The ambulance will be coming.
I'll sign the certificate first thing in the morning.

736
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,661
- Let me see. Where did I leave my coat?
- It's here, I think.

737
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,604
<i> Don't think me heartless.</i>
<i>In my position one must try to be hard.</i>

738
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,974
Death is like a business.

739
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,206
It has to be attended to.

740
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,775
Why, it's Phillipe, isn't it?

741
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,048
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
<i>You ought to be in bed.</i>

742
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,555
We found him wandering around.

743
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,559
We were going to send him home
when we heard about the accident.

744
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,129
He said he was sleepwalking.

745
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,199
Why, I know Phillipe.
He doesn't walk in his sleep.

746
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,359
Do you, Phillipe?

747
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,471
What's the boy been doing?

748
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,542
<i> Now, listen, Phillipe,</i>
<i>did anything happen to frighten you?</i>

749
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:11,205
We went to the zoo, that's all.
The boy's tired out.

750
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,283
I'll take him upstairs to bed.

751
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,353
Wait a moment.
Come here, Phillipe.

752
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,384
- Did he see it?
- I don't think so.

753
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:28,091
Well, you're a fine sort of chap, aren't you,
wandering about at night in your pajamas.

754
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:31,166
<i>Who do you think you are</i>-
<i>Nick Carter?</i>

755
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,294
Where'd you get this outfit?

756
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,306
We had to find him those
at the station.

757
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,501
Why did you run away, Phillipe?

758
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,510
I've told you -
she went for the boy.

759
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,512
<i>Tell me everything you know, Phillipe.</i>

760
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,775
<i>Then you won't be frightened anymore.</i>

761
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,976
It's long past bedtime.
We'll go upstairs.

762
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,849
- <i>He needs sleep.</i>
- I'm a doctor, Baines.

763
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,923
Why was she angry with you, Phillipe?

764
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,923
Because of secrets.

765
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,925
<i>Secrets?</i>
<i>Do you know what he means?</i>

766
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,928
You've no business pestering the boy.
He's half asleep.

767
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,998
What were those secrets, Phillipe?

768
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,430
Come on. You can tell me.
Was she angry at the zoo?

769
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,802
- No.
- Was everything all right at the zoo?

770
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,307
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Do you know what made her angry?

771
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,775
No.

772
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,346
You're not angry with Baines,
are you?

773
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,609
No. Of course not.

774
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,151
You're not going
to send him to prison.

775
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,848
Doctors don't do that.

776
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,424
I don't mind going to bed now.

777
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,857
You'd better take him up there, Baines.

778
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,157
Give him one of these tablets.

779
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,567
Was it self-defense,
like in Africa?

780
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:53,245
Dr., um - Dr. What's-his-name
is the police doctor, isn't he? Dr. Wilson?

781
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,249
Good evening, Dr. Fenton.

782
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,751
This is a terrible business.
Is Baines about?

783
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,755
He's upstairs putting the child to bed.
He was found in the street, scared.

784
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,757
What about?

785
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,760
I should like the police doctor
called in, if you don't mind.

786
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,194
Police doctor?
What's he got to do with it?

787
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,322
I should like Dr. Wilson called.

788
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:13,425
- <i>Surely there is nothing to worry you, is there?</i>
- <i> Possibly not.</i>

789
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:19,803
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

790
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,934
The ambassador's a great stickler.

791
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,445
He won't like the police
within the embassy.

792
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,710
You do realize that this is
officially foreign territory.

793
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,911
- Police are not allowed in here without permission.
- The woman's dead.

794
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,682
Yes, but an accident, surely.

795
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:38,193
- Probably.
- Well, wasn't it?

796
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,761
Perhaps.

797
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,057
But I'm not prepared
to sign the death certificate.

798
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:46,261
Very well. I'll have to phone
the foreign office in Scotland Yard.

799
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,929
Goodness only knows whether
there'll be anybody there this hour.

800
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,529
The Yard doesn't close, sir.

801
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,905
I meant the foreign office.

802
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,536
It'll make you sleep.

803
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:03,246
You've got to try and put it
right out of your head, Phile...

804
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,582
everything you've seen
and heard tonight.

805
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,150
I understand.

806
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,885
Well, go to sleep...

807
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,896
and forget it.

808
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:18,667
I'm going to give you
two night-lights tonight.

809
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:22,999
It'll be daylight before
you can sayJack Robinson.

810
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,336
Baines, are you going?

811
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,935
Listen, Phile, you -

812
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:34,071
you remember that telegram
Mrs. Baines sent me?

813
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:38,984
You had it.
You -You made a dart of it.

814
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,819
- What did you do with it?
- I threw it away.

815
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,517
Where?

816
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,164
I - I don't remember.

817
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,392
Why?

818
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:56,165
Well, I wouldn't -
I wouldn't like anyone else to find it.

819
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:01,367
You see, th-they think Mrs. Baines
was with us at the zoo.

820
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:04,537
It'd look funny,
that telegram coming.

821
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:08,378
And I - I don't want them to know
Julie was with us tonight.

822
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,452
She wouldn't like it.

823
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,890
There's no need to tell the police
more than they know.

824
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,290
Yes, I understand.

825
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,328
Are you scared?

826
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,830
Scared? No.

827
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,995
Only we've -we've got to be careful
what we say to policemen.

828
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,100
Oh, well, no good putting it off, I suppose.
Better go down and talk to them.

829
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,814
Good night, Phile.

830
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:44,216
Baines, you could run away.

831
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,564
I remember.

832
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,138
I remember where I threw it.

833
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,871
Well, then I heard the boy say,
"Was it in self-defense?"

834
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,503
He admits there was a quarrel
at the head of the stairs.

835
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,947
- Is that the staircase?
- Yes.

836
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,951
<i>Are the injuries consistent</i>
<i>with a slip</i>-

837
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,954
Evening, Fenton.
It's an awful hour to be called out.

838
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:23,787
- I'm used to it. It's the hour for babies.
- Is it? Well, what's the trouble?

839
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,293
This is Inspector Hart, sir,
of the special branch.

840
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,364
He'll help with any interpreting.

841
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,594
I wouldn't mind so much
if the ambassador was here.

842
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,711
- You were here at the time?
- No.

843
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,714
I was having dinner with some friends
in a restaurant.

844
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,512
All right, all right.
Where is this fellow Baines?

845
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,519
In the basement, I think.

846
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,522
No, he went upstairs
putting the child to bed.

847
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:57,991
There'd be no objection, I suppose,
to our seeing over the servants' quarters?

848
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:01,257
No, none at all.
Through the door there.

849
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,336
You would trouble me much less
if you'd speak English.

850
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,104
Of course, the story
of her slipping may be true...

851
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:20,181
but the type of injuries
suggest something more violent.

852
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,081
What if there'd been a push?

853
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,154
- Why do you say that?
- We know that they quarreled.

854
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,419
- Up there?
- Mmm.

855
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:33,427
- Is he a big chap?
- You saw him come down just now.

856
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,497
Oh, he.

857
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,816
- Mr. Baines?
- Yes.

858
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,321
We've permission
to ask you a few questions.

859
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,325
This has been a terrible night for you
and we don't propose to keep you long.

860
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,395
I'll tell you anything I know.

861
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,666
There was nobody else in the house,
was there, when it happened?

862
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,676
No.

863
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:25,110
You had supper out in the yard.

864
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,182
The boy wanted a picnic.

865
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:28,841
Just the three of you.

866
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,351
Just the boy and I.

867
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,354
But there were three places laid.

868
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,986
Oh, yes, of course.

869
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,756
I forgot.
Mrs. Baines was with us.

870
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,024
Try to remember things like that.

871
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:46,659
It helps us, you know,
to get the details right.

872
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,862
I'm sorry.

873
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,098
Can we have a word with you?

874
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,438
<i>Good heavens.</i>
<i>What's he doing there?</i>

875
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,612
Now what, boy?

876
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,615
- Come along, Phile.
- It's all right, Baines. I'll take him up.

877
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,117
Hello. What's this
you've got hold of? Hmm?

878
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,882
You don't want that now.
I'll take it. Now watch. See?

879
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,930
He's in the same room?

880
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,001
Baines.
Is he in the same room?

881
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,634
Uh, y-yes.

882
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,621
Well, what was he up to?

883
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,629
Oh, n-nothing, sir.

884
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:25,962
Mr. Baines, I understand
there was some sort of scene...

885
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,969
between your wife
and the boy tonight.

886
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:31,266
Do you know what it was about?

887
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:34,399
Well, she - sh-sh-she used to
get in a fuss about...

888
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,910
trying to keep the house tidy.

889
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,276
Do you know what he'd been up to?

890
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:42,350
Or was there nothing unusual
to make her angry tonight?

891
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,183
No.

892
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:50,190
You said just now that Mrs. Baines
had had supper with you downstairs.

893
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,628
You did say that, didn't you?

894
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,199
Yes.

895
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:02,199
Well, then -

896
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:06,365
I - I... forgot.

897
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,375
She wasn't with us.

898
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,843
But there were three places laid.

899
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,210
<i>Who else was there?</i>

900
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:17,752
Nobody.
I- I-I must have laid it from h-habit.

901
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,219
But the third place was used.

902
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,449
<i>How do you account for that?</i>

903
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:29,329
Well, I think we'll leave all the questions
to Chief Inspector Crowe in the morning...

904
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:31,331
after he's read the doctor's report.

905
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,901
Doctor's report?

906
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:38,440
It's only that your story of the slip
doesn't quite fit in with what they say.

907
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,626
Julie!

908
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,896
- Why not tell them everything?
- No, no. Leave it to me.

909
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,903
There's no need for you
to be brought into this.

910
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,371
- You go to the office.
-

911
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:17,341
- Good morning, Baines.
- Good morning, sir.

912
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:20,347
- Are they here yet?
- Not yet, sir.

913
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,644
Who is this lady?

914
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:26,152
She - She works here, sir,
in the typing room.

915
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,485
- A bit early, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

916
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:31,219
I had something to do
that I didn't finish on Saturday.

917
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,557
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

918
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:37,530
Do you do shorthand?

919
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:40,659
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Good. Don't go for a moment.</i>

920
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,001
Chief Inspector Crowe, sir.

921
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:48,008
I'm the first secretary. I'm in charge here
until the ambassador returns.

922
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:51,011
Yes, I know. We shall try to cause you
as little trouble as possible.

923
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,013
I see.
This is Mr. Baines.

924
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,742
Oh.
My sympathy, Mr. Baines.

925
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,753
- My ambassador will expect a full report.
- Yes, naturally.

926
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:03,256
Have you any objection to
one of our typists taking down what's said?

927
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,259
No, none whatever.

928
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,262
Actually, I've no right to object.
We're on foreign territory here.

929
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,764
Oh, could I see
the little boy, Phillipe.

930
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,925
- If you think it's necessary-
- Yes. Thank you.

931
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:16,095
<i>Oh, Baines, uh, would you? Better fetch him.</i>

932
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,608
- <i> Have you got a notebook?</i>
- <i> I'll get one, sir.</i>

933
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:31,715
There.

934
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,720
What shall I say, Baines?

935
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:38,350
Tell them anything they want to know,
except for you-know-who.

936
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,724
Was it like this
that time in Africa?

937
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,229
- What time?
- The time you killed a man.

938
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,232
Not a bit like this.

939
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:47,859
Don't worry, Baines.
I won't tell them anything.

940
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,712
<i>Would you mind, Baines,</i>
<i>putting a notice on the front door...</i>

941
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,840
telling the clerks to use the empty office
next to the visa section next door.

942
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:05,181
- Hello, sonny. Don't run away.
- I wasn't running away.

943
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:08,188
No, I mean, I just wanted
to say, "How do you do?"

944
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:11,088
- Your name is Phillipe, isn't it?
- Yes.

945
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,320
I've heard quite a lot about you.

946
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:16,330
- You're the little boy who ran away.
- I didn't run away.

947
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,662
I've said that again, have I?

948
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,235
I meant, you're the one
who took a walk.

949
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:25,637
And a rather late walk, wasn't it?
After supper, hmm?

950
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:29,177
Oh, quite a party you had last night,
didn't you? A picnic party.

951
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:31,178
No.

952
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,113
- Didn't you have it downstairs with -
- No!

953
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:35,843
Do you want me
to take all this down?

954
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:39,614
No, no, no.
This is just friendly conversation.

955
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:42,555
We are friends, aren't we?

956
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,626
- Hmm?
- No.

957
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:50,098
Well, anyway, you didn't have
a picnic downstairs last night with anybody.

958
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,963
No!

959
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,036
I've put up the notice.

960
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:56,900
No!

961
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,642
I'd like to have a word
with Mr. Baines.

962
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:05,646
- Where could we be quiet?
- Uh, here in the ambassador's room.

963
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:08,308
I'd like you and your secretary
to be present.

964
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,817
I just want to get
Mr. Baines's story quite straight.

965
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,819
- My story's straight enough.
- Yes, yes, of course.

966
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:15,890
I just want to iron out
one or two inconsistencies.

967
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,727
Oh, would you wait outside
for a few moments, sonny?

968
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,263
I just want to have
a little talk with Mr. Baines.

969
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:26,129
- Have you got a ball to play with?
- No.

970
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,203
Well - Oh. Mm-hmm.

971
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:33,237
Uh, Ames, let him borrow
your chiming watch.

972
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,476
It's like this, see.

973
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:43,039
Do be careful with it now.

974
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,654
Tsk.
Poor Mrs. Baines.

975
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,819
Down these very stairs.
I can almost see her. Can't you?

976
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,160
Yes. I expect her neck
was snapped like a matchstick.

977
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,166
- Mmm.
- Do you see any blood?

978
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,328
There wouldn't be any blood
if her neck was broken, would there?

979
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,804
Might be a little
if the bone came through.

980
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:08,035
Treacherous stuff, this marble.
I wouldn't have it in my house at any price.

981
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:16,144
You listen to the watch, sonny.

982
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,979
I wonder if you could find
something to do somewhere else, hmm?

983
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,060
Crowe says, will you photograph the position
of the body from the top of the stairs.

984
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:28,789
Right.

985
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:34,695
No, not that way, sonny.

986
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,896
Like this. See?

987
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,079
- What are you doing?
- Hmm?

988
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,081
Oh, yes. See this powder?

989
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:51,949
Well, that's solved more crimes
than the whole police force put together.

990
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:55,455
Here, put your thumb just down there.
Just press it down quite like that. That's it.

991
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,457
Now put some powder on.

992
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,527
Now you blow and watch.

993
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:07,601
See? There's only one person in the world
that has a thumb like that.

994
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,001
And that's how we find things out.

995
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:16,038
Yes, they, uh -

996
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:19,045
they want to have
a word with you, Phile.

997
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:22,514
Oh, well, we shan't need you
for a few moments, Baines.

998
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:25,052
Well, I'll be downstairs.

999
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:34,194
Well, Phillipe, I don't suppose
you ever met a detective before.

1000
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:36,264
Except in books.

1001
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,191
Did the watch work?

1002
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,395
Not taken out the works yet?

1003
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:46,235
You know, Phillipe,
I've got a boy at home very like you.

1004
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:48,707
He's a bit older, that's all.

1005
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,711
Oh, he likes marbles.
Do you like marbles?

1006
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:54,179
Look here.
What do you think of that one?

1007
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,751
I think that's a champion.
Don't you?

1008
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,320
I always win with it anyway.

1009
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,458
I don't suppose Mrs. Baines
would have liked marbles, would she?

1010
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:09,163
But I expect Baines could
throw a marble with the best of us.

1011
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,255
I like Baines.
Don't you?

1012
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,095
Yes.

1013
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:15,567
But not Mrs. Baines?

1014
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:18,231
She killed Macgregor.

1015
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,002
Killed Macgregor?
Who was he?

1016
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,407
- My snake.
- Oh.

1017
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:25,480
You can keep that marble if you'd like.

1018
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:30,609
Baines had a quarrel with Mrs. Baines
about you last night, didn't he?

1019
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,856
No!

1020
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,051
Didn't you hear them quarreling?

1021
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,752
No!

1022
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:43,353
- Phillipe, why did you run away?
- I took a walk.

1023
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:47,162
Oh, a bit late, wasn't it, for a walk?
In your pajamas?

1024
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,931
Now, wasn't it because Mrs. Baines
frightened you?

1025
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:52,165
No.

1026
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,868
But she did hit you, didn't she?

1027
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:56,877
No.

1028
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,039
- She came to your room last night.
- No.

1029
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:04,278
Phillipe, tell me, what did you see
that made you run away?

1030
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,286
I didn't run away.

1031
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,915
Mrs. Baines was away all day
yesterday, wasn't she?

1032
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:14,325
- What did you do?
- I went to the zoo with Baines and -

1033
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,158
"And"?

1034
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,228
<i>Phillipe. And?</i>

1035
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,998
And then we went to the reptile house,
and then we came home.

1036
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,199
- And then?
- We had supper.

1037
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,833
- "We"?
- Baines.

1038
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,208
- I, Baines and -
- Yes? And?

1039
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,248
And then we -
And then we played games.

1040
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:37,750
- What sort of games, Phillipe?
- Hide-and-seek in the dark.

1041
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:40,481
I always get a bit frightened
when I play that. Who hid?

1042
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,489
I hid, and they couldn't find me.

1043
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,424
- "They"?
- Baines, I mean! Baines, I mean!

1044
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,927
"They," Phillipe?
Now, who was with Baines?

1045
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,396
- Nobody! Nobody!
- Phillipe.

1046
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,366
- Who did you play hide-and-seek with?
- Baines!Just Baines!

1047
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,911
You must tell the truth.

1048
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,914
What is this? What are they saying?

1049
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,917
- It's a bit fast, sir. I can't quite follow.
- Will you speak English, please.

1050
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,543
<i>Don't badger them.!</i>

1051
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,885
I'm here, aren't I,
if you want to ask any questions.

1052
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:19,392
Now, Phillipe, tell me...

1053
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,894
who was with Baines?

1054
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:25,229
His niece.

1055
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:28,393
- <i> Was she your niece, Mr. Baines?</i>
- I told him so.

1056
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,933
Your girl?

1057
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,907
Yes. It was me.

1058
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:40,277
- You were here?
- Yes. He wanted to keep me out of it.

1059
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,408
He d - He di -
didn't mean any harm.

1060
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,419
And this telegram?

1061
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,752
She tried to catch us out, I suppose.

1062
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,758
You'd better go upstairs, Phillipe.

1063
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:54,328
You can keep the marble if you like.

1064
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,632
- Baines.
- No, no. Mr. Baines is staying here.

1065
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,936
Now we're getting somewhere.

1066
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:07,372
<i>Your quarrel with Mrs. Baines last night</i>
<i>was over this young lady.</i>

1067
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:11,435
It was what I said.
She went for the boy. She was hitting him.

1068
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:13,605
That's not what the boy says.

1069
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:15,615
Can't you see that child is lying?

1070
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,844
I'm afraid there have been
a lot of lies in this business.

1071
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:21,787
- There was no need for them.
- I sincerely hope there wasn't.

1072
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:26,850
Now, will you come upstairs
and tell me exactly what happened.

1073
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:32,328
I was in this room... with Julie.

1074
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,334
Mm-hmm? Yes?

1075
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,996
I thought I heard the boy calling.

1076
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:39,471
I came out here...

1077
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:44,043
and then I saw her hit him,
as I told you.

1078
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:47,377
- <i> Go on.</i>
- <i>She came running down these stairs.</i>

1079
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:51,111
She wanted to get into that room,
toJulie.

1080
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,922
I caught hold of her.

1081
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,524
She pushed me back.

1082
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,595
She was hysterical.

1083
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:05,257
She used to get into these rages
and do anything.

1084
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:09,701
I've known her to put her hand
through a window she couldn't open.

1085
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,205
I wasn't going to let her get in there.

1086
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,798
Yes? And then?

1087
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,606
And then I pushed her back...

1088
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,647
over there.

1089
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:23,013
She was shouting all the time.

1090
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:26,380
I don't remember exactly what.

1091
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:31,259
And we -we were struggling...

1092
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,259
here.

1093
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,261
Yes.

1094
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:38,025
"Stop it," I said. "Stop it.

1095
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:41,193
Go downstairs, and presently
I'll come down and talk to you."

1096
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:44,704
<i>Then she seemed calmer</i>
<i>and started down the stairs.</i>

1097
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:47,104
I went back to this room.

1098
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:52,078
- What is it, Harry?
- They're on the telephone from Selfridges.

1099
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:56,173
They want to know if it'd be all right if they deliver
the 40 gilt chairs tomorrow afternoon...

1100
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:58,184
<i>instead of today...</i>

1101
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,186
<i>as the reception</i>
<i>is not till Wednesday night.</i>

1102
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:03,689
Yes, yes, tomorrow will be all right.

1103
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:07,284
Then I -
I went back to this door.

1104
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:14,997
No, Harry- Harry, tell them they must
deliver the chairs today because we -

1105
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:19,631
Just tell them they must
deliver the chairs as arranged.

1106
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:26,073
Then I -
I went back to the door.

1107
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:30,744
When I got there,
I heard the scream...

1108
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:33,921
as I told you.

1109
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,286
I came out...

1110
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,519
and when I got here...

1111
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,722
I saw her hit the last step.

1112
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:46,733
<i>We've examined this staircase</i>
<i>very carefully, Mr. Baines...</i>

1113
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:49,736
and there's no evidence
of her having slipped.

1114
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:52,739
When people slip,
they try to recover.

1115
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:56,971
They leave some sign -
a scratch on the banister, anything.

1116
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,410
<i>It's just like a car skidding.</i>

1117
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:01,914
- What, and there's nothing?
- <i> Nothing.</i>

1118
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:05,953
And the injuries would indicate
something more than a slip.

1119
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:09,023
<i>You're quite sure</i>
<i>you didn't, uh, push her?</i>

1120
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:11,524
You were both, I take it, very angry.

1121
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:14,595
I'd done enough to her without that.

1122
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:17,290
You see,
if she'd slipped from here...

1123
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,299
or even a few steps down...

1124
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,199
she couldn't possibly have landed
where she did -

1125
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,397
because we've tested that -

1126
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,475
unless she was pushed.

1127
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:33,036
<i>You're a very strong man, Mr. Baines.</i>
<i>You probably don't know your own strength.</i>

1128
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:35,378
I didn't push her.

1129
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:40,947
Why did the boy ask you,
"Was it self-defense...

1130
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:43,388
<i>as in Africa?'"</i>

1131
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:46,392
I've never been out of the country.

1132
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:50,123
- Never?
- <i>Well, except once, to Ostend.</i>

1133
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:54,531
Very well, Mr. Baines. Would you come
into the other room? And you too, miss.

1134
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,741
- And whose room is this?
- A guest room.

1135
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:05,745
Where were you when it happened,
when the scream came, hmm?

1136
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:07,815
Yes?

1137
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,084
There.

1138
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:15,520
Although there had been a struggle outside
and angry words, according to Mr. Baines?

1139
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,759
I couldn't do anything else.

1140
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:23,490
I should have thought
you'd have got up and tried to hide.

1141
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,498
I couldn't.

1142
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,501
I'm sorry to have to ask you
all these questions.

1143
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:32,300
- You then dressed in a great hurry, I suppose.
- Of course.

1144
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:34,307
That would be after the scream.

1145
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:36,309
Yes.

1146
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:39,812
How long was that
after the child called out?

1147
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:42,144
I don't know.

1148
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,651
Two, three minutes.
I don't know.

1149
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:49,053
- The child said he never called out.
- He must be lying.

1150
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,684
It's obvious somebody must be lying.

1151
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:56,059
When you dressed,
what did you do?

1152
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:58,064
He showed me out.

1153
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:01,966
<i>Wouldn't it have been wiser,</i>
<i>and more honest, to have stayed?</i>

1154
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:06,973
He wanted to keep me out of it.
I was frightened because of our lies.

1155
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,702
I don't understand you.

1156
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,573
Then I - I can't explain to you.

1157
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:15,581
<i>How long had you known Mr. Baines?</i>

1158
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:19,244
Ever since I started to work
at the embassy- seven months.

1159
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:22,050
- <i>Without Mrs. Baines's knowledge?</i>
- Yes.

1160
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:25,422
<i>And all that time you were</i>
<i>carrying on an affair with each other.</i>

1161
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:41,533
- We are very busy here.
- Won't be a moment.

1162
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,110
Look, can't you come back later?

1163
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,704
The first Monday of every month...

1164
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:50,717
this clock has to be done.

1165
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:55,779
They behave much better if they're, uh -
if they're looked after.

1166
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,290
<i>Oh, be as quick as you can.</i>

1167
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,759
<i>You don't want to do it jerkily...</i>

1168
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,160
and not too fast.

1169
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,499
You must take your time.

1170
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,405
Thank you.

1171
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:21,840
Did you ever discuss marriage?

1172
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,151
No.

1173
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:29,314
But your relations with this man
were intimate.

1174
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:33,791
- We love each other.
- And intimacy took place during that period?

1175
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,694
We don't talk the same language.
I don't know what you mean.

1176
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:41,064
- I mean, in plain language -
- Oh, leave her alone, can't you?

1177
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,501
Don't worry.
It's his duty to ask questions.

1178
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:46,506
Last night was the first time
we were ever alone like this.

1179
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:50,408
Now, you take your photographs
and fingerprints and everything.

1180
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,140
It's love you'll photograph,
not "intimacy."

1181
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:55,375
What do you want, sonny?

1182
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:58,816
You've got to leave Baines alone.
He didn't do it.

1183
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:03,219
- Didn't do what?
- He didn't murder her!

1184
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:10,392
Why did you say "murder," Phillipe?

1185
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,398
No one has mentioned murder.

1186
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,730
Thank heaven someone has then.

1187
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,736
Why did you say "murder," Phillipe?

1188
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,806
He didn't do it.

1189
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:22,568
Well, if he didn't do it...

1190
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,577
who did?

1191
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,579
Hmm?

1192
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:30,139
I did. My thumbmark's
downstairs on the banister.

1193
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,088
Will somebody take this child away?

1194
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,182
Come on.

1195
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:41,387
- I'll take him upstairs.
- No, Mr. Baines, it might be better
if you kept away from the boy.

1196
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:43,464
What, are you charging me?

1197
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,965
I would advise you
to reconsider your story.

1198
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:48,729
You've already admitted that you were
both quarreling at the top of the stairs.

1199
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:51,566
<i>Perhaps there was a push</i>
<i>that you didn't intend.</i>

1200
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:54,073
Only please don't ask us
to believe too much.

1201
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:56,905
- I tell you, I don't know how she fell!
- He's quite right, Baines.

1202
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,411
- Think carefully.
- I don't have to think! It's the truth!

1203
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,948
Run along, sonny.

1204
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,450
- I'll take him up.
- <i>I don't think you'd better, miss.</i>

1205
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,453
There's questions to be asked, and the less
either of you see the boy the better.

1206
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,456
- Are you forbidding me?
- No, I'm advising you. That's all.

1207
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:13,721
- In your interest and Mr. Baines's.
- Well, I know his interests better than you do.

1208
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:15,887
As you please, miss.

1209
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:19,592
- Would you care to sit down, Mr. Baines?
- <i>I'm all right.</i>

1210
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:23,963
Listen, you've got to stop telling these lies.
It's only silly. It makes things much worse.

1211
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:27,496
It doesn't. We've got to think of lies
and tell them all the time.

1212
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,203
Then they won't find out the truth.

1213
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,245
But Baines didn't do it, Phillipe!

1214
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:35,248
She hit me.
Baines doesn't let people hit me.

1215
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,444
Of course he doesn't.
But he'd never kill anyone. You must know that.

1216
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:42,751
- Why, he did in Africa.
- Oh, that's one of his stories.
He's never been to Africa.

1217
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:45,382
Baines doesn't tell me lies.

1218
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:48,394
He's got a gun too.

1219
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:51,056
You can't have understood, Phillipe.

1220
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:54,498
The truth can't harm Baines.
Don't you realize he's innocent?

1221
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:58,968
- Oh, if there could only have been a witness.
- What's a witness?

1222
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,337
Someone who saw.

1223
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:04,775
Couldn't I say
that I saw somebody?

1224
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:07,313
Phillipe, now what
have I just told you?

1225
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:13,513
Now listen, you promise that from now on
you'll speak only the truth.

1226
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,181
- Must I?
- Yes, you must. Now, you promise?

1227
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,954
- If you like.
- All right. Now you go and tell them
that you told a lot of lies.

1228
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,256
Mr. Baines, it would be
much more satisfactory...

1229
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:25,298
if you'd consent to come along with us
just to make a formal statement.

1230
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,301
And more convenient
for the embassy too, I should think.

1231
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:30,303
Do I have to?

1232
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:33,306
You've got to decide it yourself, Baines.

1233
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:35,308
They can't force you to leave here.

1234
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:38,311
They can't arrest you
so long as you are an embassy employee.

1235
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:40,313
Of course,
we could appeal to the ambassador.

1236
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:43,043
- Yes, yes? What is it, Phillipe?
- I've told you lies.

1237
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:46,348
Yes, yes, I know all that.
I'd strongly advise you, Mr. Baines -

1238
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:50,891
- Mrs. Baines did hit me.
- Yes, yes. You shouldn't tell lies.

1239
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,358
I only wanted to help Baines.
Please.

1240
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:58,922
I'd strongly advise you, Mr. Baines, to come with us,
or else we shall have to appeal to the ambassador.

1241
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,734
I don't want His Excellency troubled.

1242
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:06,898
I'll get my hat.

1243
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:11,069
That's all right, Mr. Baines.
Perhaps Mr. Hart would get it for you.

1244
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,545
I'm not under arrest yet, am I?

1245
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:16,310
I'm going down to my own basement...

1246
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:19,181
and I haven't invited the police there.

1247
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,621
Baines! Oh, Baines!

1248
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:30,630
Now, now, you, uh -
you mustn't come with me, Phile.

1249
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:33,394
They-They don't want me
to talk to you.

1250
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:35,901
I haven't done harm, have I?

1251
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:39,905
Trouble is, we -
we've told a lot of lies.

1252
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:43,773
About Africa -
you didn't make it up, did you?

1253
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,312
They weren't lies.

1254
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:49,679
Why, that was just a game, Phile.

1255
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:52,218
I didn't really do those things.

1256
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,311
No?

1257
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:57,448
But you did kill Mrs. Baines,
didn't you?

1258
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,362
<i>Yes?</i>

1259
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:05,122
- <i>Didn't you?</i>
- No.

1260
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:08,794
Oh.

1261
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:13,465
But you did want to be free,
didn't you?

1262
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,805
There are faults on both sides, Phile.

1263
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:20,312
We don't have any call to judge.

1264
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,612
Perhaps she was what she was because...

1265
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:26,380
I am what I am.

1266
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:29,217
We ought to be very careful, Phile...

1267
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:31,450
'cause we make one another.

1268
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:33,857
I thought God made us.

1269
01:30:35,963 --> 01:30:38,693
Trouble is,
we take a hand in the game.

1270
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:42,429
I hope your mother comes back soon.

1271
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:47,002
Good-bye, Phile.

1272
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:51,010
Oh, Baines, we must never
tell any more lies.

1273
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:12,865
- Mr. Crowe, sir.
- Yes?

1274
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:15,561
- Will you come over here a minute?
- <i>What is it?</i>

1275
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,831
Somebody's been up here.

1276
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:23,968
Oh, sir, that was me.
Sir! Sir!

1277
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:26,706
Please.
I want to tell you something.

1278
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:29,510
I want to tell you something.

1279
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:31,209
<i>It's very important.</i>

1280
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,550
Yes, it's a woman's heel mark, all right.

1281
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:37,146
- Please, sir. Please.
- Run along.

1282
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:40,159
- You can see how it happened.
- <i>Oh, please. It'll only take a minute.</i>

1283
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:43,287
- She wanted to see into the bedroom...
- <i>Please, sir. Please.</i>

1284
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:46,924
- maybe force her way in.
- <i>Will you listen to me, please?</i>

1285
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:50,561
She came along here
and upset the flowerpot.

1286
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,902
<i>Please, sir.!</i>
<i>It's about the flowerpot.</i>

1287
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:57,500
- Could she have got
into the bedroom from there?
- Ah, yes, sir, easily.

1288
01:31:57,612 --> 01:32:01,013
- I must tell you. Will you listen to me?
- Come along. We don't want another accident.

1289
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:02,878
<i>You must listen to me.</i>

1290
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:06,215
How much easier it would be if everybody
told the police the truth in the first place.

1291
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,413
It's very important! Please!

1292
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,720
- Would you call Mr. Baines.
- I'll get him.

1293
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:15,125
- The flowerpot,Julie, was there when -
- It's all right. They know what happened.

1294
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:18,198
- She upset it before she fell.
- But it was me. I upset it.

1295
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:23,059
Now, will somebody
please listen to me!

1296
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:26,071
You don't need your hat.

1297
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:28,073
They know what happened.

1298
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:30,143
It's all right.
Come on upstairs.

1299
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,678
You must listen.
It will make everything all right.

1300
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,680
- Now, sonny-
- It's the truth.

1301
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:37,910
- I'd like to call your ambassador on his return
just to explain our action.
- Oh, please. Oh, please.

1302
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:41,079
Oh, Mr. Baines,
we shan't require you after all.

1303
01:32:41,188 --> 01:32:44,123
<i>We found some evidence up there</i>
<i>which makes sense of your story.</i>

1304
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,787
<i>Yes, she-she's told me.</i>

1305
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:50,557
Now we know how it happened,
what you've said is quite clear.

1306
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:53,964
- Please, I've got to tell you something.
- Will you send this young shaver about his business?

1307
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:55,968
- Come along, Phile.
- I've got to tell him.

1308
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,664
Sit down over there, Phile.
We'll attend to you presently.

1309
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:00,673
Come on. Come on. Over there.

1310
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:02,675
- Sir, please! I'm telling the truth!
- Sit down.

1311
01:33:02,777 --> 01:33:06,440
- Your father always goes away
at the worst possible moment.
- It's the truth this time.

1312
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:09,675
- Where did we leave the hats?
- I'll go and get them, sir.

1313
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:20,459
Your evidence will be needed
at the inquest, Mr. Baines.

1314
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:24,827
-
- Of course, we must keep the boy out of it.

1315
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:32,303
<i>Oui.</i>

1316
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:37,309
I'm afraid, sir,
we've caused you some trouble.

1317
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:39,436
That's all right.
If only-

1318
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:41,515
Oh, well.
That doesn't matter.

1319
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,150
Oh, please. Please.

1320
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:48,483
It's the truth. Please.

1321
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:51,490
Oh, please, do listen to me.
Please.

1322
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:53,856
It's very important
what I want to tell you.

1323
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:55,861
Well, what is it?

1324
01:33:55,963 --> 01:34:00,491
- Julie said only the truth would help Baines.
- What do you want to say?

1325
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:06,039
It wasn't Mrs. Baines that upset the flowerpot.
It was me. You see?

1326
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,608
<i>It's</i> my <i>fault.</i>
I <i>did it.</i>

1327
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:14,004
- I've told fibs in my time too.
- Cross my heart!

1328
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:16,675
Shall I tell you a secret?

1329
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:18,684
No!

1330
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,000
Nice weekend, Mr. Baines?

1331
01:34:35,102 --> 01:34:37,002
<i>Phillipe.!</i>

1332
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:39,004
Phillipe, your mother!
