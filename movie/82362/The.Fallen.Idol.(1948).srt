00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,660
I put Macgregor to bed.
She nearly caught me.

303
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,391
Phile, I'd say I'm sorry about it.

304
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,831
- You know. Lunchtime.
- Hmm.

305
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,803
If my mother does come back on Monday,
it won't make any difference to us, will it?

306
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,874
Not a bit.

307
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,490
I'm sorry I said I hated you.

308
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,559
It's all right.

309
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,160
<i>[ Mrs. Baines ]</i>
<i>I said you weren't to take him out.</i>

310
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,963
<i>[ Mr. Baines ]</i>
<i>I didn't take him out. I brought him home.</i>

311
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,766
You went out by the back door...

312
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,809
he by the fire escape,
and you two met outside.

313
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,606
Phile's been out on his own.
So have I.

314
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,079
I told him he wasn't to go out,
and you take him.

315
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,480
<i>[ Mr. Baines ]</i>
<i>Oh, don't let's talk about him.</i>

316
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,386
- <i>There's something more important.</i>
- What could that be?

317
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,456
You and I.

318
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,394
Go on.

319
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,695
Well, Ive tried to make a go of it.

320
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,893
And so have you.

321
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,903
But we only make each other miserable.

322
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,338
It's years now since there's been a day
without some blessed row.

323
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,744
- <i>We can't go on like this.</i>
- You want your freedom?

324
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,348
You don't want me around anymore.

325
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,045
This is something new,
this kind of talk.

326
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,121
Ive thought about it long enough.

327
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,053
- And now it's time tell you. Because -
- You go off, and see what happens to me.

328
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:14,495
-<i>[ Mr. Baines ] Oh, don't talk like that.</i>
-<i>[ Mrs. Baines ] You do as you say.</i>
<i>You and your freedom.</i>

330

<i>You'll be able to say, 'That's me. I did that. ?</i>
<i>That'll make you feel happy.</i>

331
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,074
Oh, don't talk so foolish.

332
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,871
Oh, go and give the boy his supper.

333
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,879
We'll talk about it later.

334
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,978
<i>[ Door Opens ]</i>

335
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,580
You know your father
doesn't like you going out alone.

336
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,151
- Funny you should meet Baines, wasn't it?
- Yes.

337
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,924
He likes wandering about
on his own too.

338
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,866
- Not much appetite, have you, Master Phillipe?
- No, Mrs. Baines.

339
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,336
Why don't you try eating some of that
nice pudding? You don't eat enough.

340
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,272
Don't eat enough to keep a fly alive.
No lunch and -

341
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,606
and now no supper, Master Phillipe.

342
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,281
So that's why youve lost your appetite,
Master Phillipe.

343
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,478
Been eating between meals.
Buying cream buns again.

344
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,078
- That's not what your pocket money is for.
- I didn't.

345
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,092
Don't lie to me, Master Phillipe. You're going to be
a fine worry to your mother when I tell her.

346
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,129
I will not put up with any more lies.
You're becoming a regular little liar!

347
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,063
- I won't put up with any more lies from you!
- They gave it to me!

348
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,533
- They?
- Baines I mean.

349
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,572
'They.'

350
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,111
Oh.

351
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,778
So that's it.

352
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,016
Yes.

353
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,227
You mustn't mind Mrs. Baines,
Master Phillipe.

354
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,322
<i>She, um-She lets her tongue</i>
<i>run away with her.</i>

355
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,730
We have a secret now...

356
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,170
you and I...

357
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,071
that I know all about them.

358
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,076
Can you keep a secret?

359
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,646
- Yes.
- Good.

360
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,113
I suppose she was having tea with him.

361
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,347
Just tea. No cakes.

362
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,289
Is she young?

363
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,087
Of course. She's his niece.

364
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,128
So that's what he said.

365
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,130
[ Chuckles ]
The old scoundrel.

366
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:31,396
It's all right. She's not seeing him anymore.
Tomorrow she's going away.

367
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,836
Is she? Tomorrow.

368
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,935
You can keep our secret now?
Hmm? Yes?

369
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,012
Yes.

370
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,350
You do, and I'll get you
that 2A Meccano set.

371
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,637
Do you want the light up there?

372
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,839
[ Mrs. Baines ] He hasn't eaten his supper.
Think he'd be hungry after his long walk.

373
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,040
[ Mr. Baines ]
Wait till I put on the light.

374
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,552
[ Mrs. Baines ] I don't think I want to go on
with our talk tonight, if you don't mind.

375
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,247
You know when you two
were out this afternoon?

376
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,327
- What? Me and Phile?
- Yes.

377
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,955
I thought to myself,
'Perhaps I stay indoors too much.

378
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,863
I ought to get out more,
take some time off.'

379
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:40,802
- Ive been telling you that for weeks.
- Yes. So you have.

380
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,840
I think it might be a very good idea.

381
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,257
<i>You asleep, Phile?</i>

[ Clicking Tongue ]

384
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,221
<i>Come on, Phile. Up you get.</i>

385
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,166
Where's Mrs. Baines?

386
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:48,137
- She's gone to see her Aunt Hilda.
- No. Why?

387
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,107
Said she needed an outing, Phile.
Like you and me.

388
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,169
- When will she come back?
- <i>Not until tomorrow morning.</i>

389
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,844
- Are we really alone?
- Of course we are.
We're going to spend the day together.

390
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,285
- Will we be alone all day, Baines?
- We'll be together, Phile.

391
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,357
It's misty still.

392
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,327
The cat's been out all night.
There she is, sniffing round the railings.

393
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,659
<i>There's Doris shaking the mats out.</i>

394

<i>It's a great life if you don't weaken.</i>

395
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,134
- It's early, isn't it?
- It's going to be a long day, Phile.

396
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,637
Now, you get dressed,
and I'll be cooking the sausages.

397
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,871
<i>[ Mr. Baines ]</i>
<i>Yes. To see her aunt.</i>

398
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,707
<i>I'm quite alone,you understand?</i>

399
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:32,010
<i>No. Not about that. No.</i>
<i>I'll explain it all.</i>

400
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,648
Oh, you must come.
You promised you would.

401
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,653
We'll have the whole day together.

402
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,622
<i>Oh, it makes no difference</i>
<i>about the boy.</i>

<i>Yes. Uh, back here to supper,Julie.</i>

404
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,657
Ah, of course it's safe. I -Well, I'm so
looking forward to seeing you,Julie.

405
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,665
<i>I must talk to you.</i>

00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,499
<i>I'll</i>- <i>I'll wait for you.</i>
<i>Of course I'll wait for you.</i>

407
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,165
<i>It'll amuse the boy,</i>
<i>and we'll be able to talk.</i>

408
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,175
No. Of course he doesn't understand.

409
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,144
3:00, and we'll be able to talk quietly.

410
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,214
[ Roars ]

411
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,481
<i>I'd rather see the snakes, Baines.</i>

412
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:17,049
I was sure you'd like the lions.
My old legs are getting tired.

413
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,528
- You're not so old, Baines.
- I'm not so young as I used to be.

414
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,963
I'll tell you what.
Let's sit down over there.

415
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,332
I'll tell you things.
Then we'll go to the reptile house.

416
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,440
Did you shoot lions in Africa?

417
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,408
Oh,just a few. I mostly let them live.

418
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,607
- You shot a man though, Baines.
- Who told you that?

419
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,910
You did.
You murdered him, you said.

420
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,078
Murdered?
I never murdered anyone.

421
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,987
You said you killed someone,
once in Africa with that gun.

422
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,494
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, well, that wasn't murder, Phile.
That was self-defense.

423
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,531
You see, one day the blackies planned
what they call a rising.

424
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,396
I was the only white man
for miles around.

425
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,938
Well, this chap -
He called himself a king.

426
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,031
He got the blackies properly
worked up, speechifying.

427
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,042

<i>Yes? Go on. Go on.</i>

Uh, th-they all came up to my hut.

430
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,280
Hundreds of them.
Knives, spears, clubs.

431
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,912
- Well, all I had was that - that gun I showed you.
- Go on.

432
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:22,083
'Clear off,' I said to that king of theirs.
'Hop it,' I said.

433
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,855
- [ Hiccups ]
- But he was after my blood.

434
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,362
Well, if they'd got me,
it wouldn't have ended there.

435
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,729
They'd have tasted blood.

436
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,496
- <i>Like those lions there.</i>
- Th-Then what happened?

437
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:37,600
Oh, I plugged him. Then I threw the gun away
and went in with my fists.

438
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,767
But you found the gun again.

439
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,177
Oh, yeah. Yes. So I did.
I'll tell you about that one day.

440
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,740
I wish I could
go away with you to Africa.

441
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,321
Oh, look. There's your niece.

442
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,987
Oh, yes. So it is.

443
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,531
Now can we go and see
the reptile house?

444
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,834
- Look. Would you like an ice cream, Phile?
- I wouldn't say no, Baines.

445
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,202
Well, here's a bob. Get one forJulie too.
There you are. Over there.

446
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,536
What did she -

447
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,942
- Did you tell her?

00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,179
Yes.

751
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,250
- Over there?
- The doctor's with her now.

752
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,978
Now...

753
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,055
just -

754
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,522
just -just sit down there...

755
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,593
for a moment, Phile.

756
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:50,064
- How did it happen?
- We'd had a few words up there.

757
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,567
She was angry with the boy
for some reason.

758
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,968
The next thing I knew...

759
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,199
she'd slipped going down the stairs.

760
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,368
- Can I help at all, sir?
- No.Just an accident.

761
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:11,046
I'll be off. There's nothing more that I can do.
You better tell the ambassador at once.

762
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:15,056
He's away.
Ive phoned the first secretary.

763
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,558
Don't worry, man.
More than you can help.

764
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,561
You did all that you could.
These things happen, you know.

765
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,063
- I can't believe that she's -
- I know.

766
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,567
The ambulance will be coming.
I'll sign the certificate first thing in the morning.

767
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,661
- Let me see. Where did I leave my coat?
- It's here, I think.

768
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,604
<i>[ Doctor ] Don't think me heartless.</i>
<i>In my position one must try to be hard.</i>

769
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,974
Death is like a business.

770
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,206
It has to be attended to.

771
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,775
Why, it's Phillipe, isn't it?

772
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,048
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
<i>You ought to be in bed.</i>

773
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,555
We found him wandering around.

774
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,559
We were going to send him home
when we heard about the accident.

775
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,129
He said he was sleepwalking.

776
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,199
Why, I know Phillipe.
He doesn't walk in his sleep.

777
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,359
Do you, Phillipe?

778
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,471
What's the boy been doing?

779
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,542
<i>[ Doctor ] Now, listen, Phillipe,</i>
<i>did anything happen to frighten you?</i>

780
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:11,205
We went to the zoo, that's all.
The boy's tired out.

781
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,283
I'll take him upstairs to bed.

782
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,353
Wait a moment.
Come here, Phillipe.

783
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,384
- Did he see it?
- I don't think so.

784
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:28,091
Well, you're a fine sort of chap, aren't you,
wandering about at night in your pajamas.

785
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:31,166
<i>Who do you think you are</i>-
<i>Nick Carter?</i>

786
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,294
Where'd you get this outfit?

787
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,306
We had to find him those
at the station.

788
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,501
Why did you run away, Phillipe?

789
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,510
Ive told you -
she went for the boy.

790
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,512
<i>[ Doctor ]</i>
<i>Tell me everything you know, Phillipe.</i>

791
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,775
<i>Then you won't be frightened anymore.</i>

792
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,976
It's long past bedtime.
We'll go upstairs.

793
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,849
- <i>He needs sleep.</i>
- I'm a doctor, Baines.

794
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,923
Why was she angry with you, Phillipe?

795
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,923
Because of secrets.

796
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,925
<i>Secrets?</i>
<i>Do you know what he means?</i>

797
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,928
Youve no business pestering the boy.
He's half asleep.

798
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,998
What were those secrets, Phillipe?

799
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,430
Come on. You can tell me.
Was she angry at the zoo?

800
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,802
- No.
- Was everything all right at the zoo?

801
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,307
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Do you know what made her angry?

802
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,775
No.

803
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,346
You're not angry with Baines,
are you?

804
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,609
No. Of course not.

805
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,151
You're not going
to send him to prison.

806
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,848
Doctors don't do that.

807
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,424
I don't mind going to bed now.

808
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,857
You'd better take him up there, Baines.

809
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,157
Give him one of these tablets.

810
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,567
Was it self-defense,
like in Africa?

811
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:53,245
Dr., um - Dr. What's-his-name
is the police doctor, isn't he? Dr. Wilson?

812
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,249
Good evening, Dr. Fenton.

813
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,751
This is a terrible business.
Is Baines about?

814
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,755
He's upstairs putting the child to bed.
He was found in the street, scared.

815
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,757
What about?

816
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,760
I should like the police doctor
called in, if you don't mind.

817
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,194
Police doctor?
What's he got to do with it?

818
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,322
I should like Dr. Wilson called.

819
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:13,425
- <i>Surely there is nothing to worry you, is there?</i>
- <i>[ Doctor ] Possibly not.</i>

820
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:19,803
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

821
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,934
The ambassador's a great stickler.

822
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,445
He won't like the police
within the embassy.

823
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,710
You do realize that this is
officially foreign territory.

824
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,911
- Police are not allowed in here without permission.
- The woman's dead.

825
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,682
Yes, but an accident, surely.

826
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:38,193
- Probably.
- Well, wasn't it?

827
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,761
Perhaps.

828
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,057
But I'm not prepared
to sign the death certificate.

829
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:46,261
Very well. I'll have to phone
the foreign office in Scotland Yard.

830
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,929
Goodness only knows whether
there'll be anybody there this hour.

831
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,529
The Yard doesn't close, sir.

832
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,905
I meant the foreign office.

833
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,536
It'll make you sleep.

834
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:03,246
Youve got to try and put it
right out of your head, Phile...

835
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,582
everything youve seen
and heard tonight.

836
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,150
I understand.

837
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,885
Well, go to sleep...

838
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,896
and forget it.

839
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:18,667
I'm going to give you
two night-lights tonight.

840
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:22,999
It'll be daylight before
you can sayJack Robinson.

841
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,336
Baines, are you going?

842
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,935
Listen, Phile, you -

843
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:34,071
you remember that telegram
Mrs. Baines sent me?

844
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:38,984
You had it.
You -You made a dart of it.

845
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,819
- What did you do with it?
- I threw it away.

846
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,517
Where?

847
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,164
I - I don't remember.

848
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,392
Why?

849
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:56,165
Well, I wouldn't -
I wouldn't like anyone else to find it.

850
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:01,367
You see, th-they think Mrs. Baines
was with us at the zoo.

851
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:04,537
It'd look funny,
that telegram coming.

852
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:08,378
And I - I don't want them to know
Julie was with us tonight.

853
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,452
She wouldn't like it.

854
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,890
There's no need to tell the police
more than they know.

855
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,290
Yes, I understand.

856
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,328
Are you scared?

857
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,830
Scared? No.

858
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,995
Only weve -weve got to be careful
what we say to policemen.

859
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,100
Oh, well, no good putting it off, I suppose.
Better go down and talk to them.

860
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,814
Good night, Phile.

861
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:44,216
Baines, you could run away.

862
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,564
I remember.

863
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,138
I remember where I threw it.

864
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,871
Well, then I heard the boy say,
'Was it in self-defense?'

865
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,503
He admits there was a quarrel
at the head of the stairs.

866
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,947
- Is that the staircase?
- Yes.

867
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,951
<i>Are the injuries consistent</i>
<i>with a slip</i>-

868
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,954
Evening, Fenton.
It's an awful hour to be called out.

869
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:23,787
- I'm used to it. It's the hour for babies.
- Is it? Well, what's the trouble?

870
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,293
This is Inspector Hart, sir,
of the special branch.

871
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,364
- He'll help with any interpreting.
- [ Speaking French ]

872
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,594
I wouldn't mind so much
if the ambassador was here.

873
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,708
[ Inspector Speaking French ]

874
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,711
- You were here at the time?
- No.

875
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,714
I was having dinner with some friends
in a restaurant.

876
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,512
All right, all right.
Where is this fellow Baines?

877
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,519
In the basement, I think.

878
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,522
No, he went upstairs
putting the child to bed.

879
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:57,991
There'd be no objection, I suppose,
to our seeing over the servants?quarters?

880
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:01,257
No, none at all.
Through the door there.

881
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:04,265
[ Speaking French ]

882
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,336
You would trouble me much less
if you'd speak English.

883
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,104
Of course, the story
of her slipping may be true...

884
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:20,181
but the type of injuries
suggest something more violent.

885
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,081
What if there'd been a push?

886
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,154
- Why do you say that?
- We know that they quarreled.

887
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,419
- Up there?
- Mmm.

888
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:33,427
- Is he a big chap?
- You saw him come down just now.

889
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,497
Oh, he.

890
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,816
- Mr. Baines?
- Yes.

891
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,321
Weve permission
to ask you a few questions.

892
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,325
This has been a terrible night for you
and we don't propose to keep you long.

893
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,395
I'll tell you anything I know.

894
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,666
There was nobody else in the house,
was there, when it happened?

895
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,676
No.

896
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:25,110
You had supper out in the yard.

897
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,182
The boy wanted a picnic.

898
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:28,841
Just the three of you.

899
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,351
Just the boy and I.

900
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,354
But there were three places laid.

901
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,986

You can keep that marble if you'd like.

1053
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:30,609
Baines had a quarrel with Mrs. Baines
about you last night, didn't he?

1054
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,856
No!

1055
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,051
Didn't you hear them quarreling?

1056
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,752
No!

1057
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:43,353
- Phillipe, why did you run away?
- I took a walk.

1058
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:47,162
Oh, a bit late, wasn't it, for a walk?
In your pajamas?

1059
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,931
Now, wasn't it because Mrs. Baines
frightened you?

1060
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:52,165
No.

1061
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,868
But she did hit you, didn't she?

1062
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:56,877
No.

1063
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,039
- She came to your room last night.
- No.

1064
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:04,278
Phillipe, tell me, what did you see
that made you run away?

1065
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,286
I didn't run away.

1066
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,915
Mrs. Baines was away all day
yesterday, wasn't she?

1067
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:14,325
- What did you do?
- I went to the zoo with Baines and -

1068
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,158
'And'?

1069
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,228
<i>Phillipe. And?</i>

1070
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,998
And then we went to the reptile house,
and then we came home.

1071
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,199
- And then?
- We had supper.

1072
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,833
- 'We'?
- Baines.

1073
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,208
- I, Baines and -
- Yes? And?

1074
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,248
And then we -
And then we played games.

1075
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:37,750
- What sort of games, Phillipe?
- Hide-and-seek in the dark.

1076
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:40,481
I always get a bit frightened
when I play that. Who hid?

1077
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,489
I hid, and they couldn't find me.

1078
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,424
- 'They'?
- Baines, I mean! Baines, I mean!

1079
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,927
'They,' Phillipe?
Now, who was with Baines?

1080
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,396
- Nobody! Nobody!
- Phillipe.

1081
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,366
- Who did you play hide-and-seek with?
- Baines!Just Baines!

<i>Your quarrel with Mrs. Baines last night</i>

It was what I said.
She went for the boy. She was hitting him.

1107
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:13,605
That's not what the boy says.

1108
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:15,615
Can't you see that child is lying?

1109
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,844
I'm afraid there have been
a lot of lies in this business.

01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:21,787
- There was no need for them.
- I sincerely hope there wasn't.

01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:26,850
Now, will you come upstairs
and tell me exactly what happened.

1112
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:32,328
I was in this room... with Julie.

1113
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,334
Mm-hmm? Yes?

1114
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,996
I thought I heard the boy calling.

I came out here...

1116
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:44,043

as I told you.

- <i>[ Crowe ] Go on.</i>
- <i>She came running down these stairs.</i>

1118
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:51,111
She wanted to get into that room,
toJulie.

1119
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,922
I caught hold of her.

1120
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,524
She pushed me back.

1121
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,595
She was hysterical.

1122
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:05,257
She used to get into these rages
and do anything.

1123
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:09,701
Ive known her to put her hand
through a window she couldn't open.

1124
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,205
I wasn't going to let her get in there.

1125
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,798
Yes? And then?

1126
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,606
And then I pushed her back...

1127
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,647
over there.

1128
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:23,013
She was shouting all the time.

1129
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:26,380
I don't remember exactly what.

1130

here.

[ Crowe ]
Yes.

1133
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:38,025
'Stop it,' I said. 'Stop it.

1134
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:41,193
Go downstairs, and presently
I'll come down and talk to you.'

1135
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:44,704
<i>Then she seemed calmer</i>
<i>and started down the stairs.</i>

1136
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:47,104
I went back to this room.

1137
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:52,078
- What is it, Harry?
- They're on the telephone from Selfridges.

1138
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:56,173
They want to know if it'd be all right if they deliver
the 40 gilt chairs tomorrow afternoon...

1139
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:58,184
<i>instead of today...</i>

1140
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,186
<i>as the reception</i>
<i>is not till Wednesday night.</i>

Yes, yes, tomorrow will be all right.

1142
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:07,284
Then I -
I went back to this door.

1143
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:14,997
No, Harry- Harry, tell them they must
deliver the chairs today because we -

1144
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:19,631
Just tell them they must
deliver the chairs as arranged.

1145
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:26,073
Then I -
I went back to the door.

1146
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:30,744
When I got there,
I heard the scream...

1147
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:33,921
as I told you.

1148
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,286
I came out...

1149
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,519
and when I got here...

1150
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,722
I saw her hit the last step.

1151
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:46,733
<i>Weve examined this staircase</i>
<i>very carefully, Mr. Baines...</i>

1152
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:49,736
and there's no evidence
of her having slipped.

1153
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:52,739
When people slip,
they try to recover.

1154
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:56,971
They leave some sign -
a scratch on the banister, anything.

1155
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,410
<i>It's just like a car skidding.</i>

1156
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:01,914
- What, and there's nothing?
- <i>[ Crowe ] Nothing.</i>

1157
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:05,953
And the injuries would indicate
something more than a slip.

1158
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:09,023
<i>You're quite sure</i>
<i>you didn't, uh, push her?</i>

1159
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:11,524
You were both, I take it, very angry.

1160
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:14,595
I'd done enough to her without that.

1161
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:17,290
You see,
if she'd slipped from here...

1162
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,299
or even a few steps down...

1163
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,199
she couldn't possibly have landed
where she did -

1164
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,397
because weve tested that -

1165
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,475
unless she was pushed.

1166
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:33,036
<i>You're a very strong man, Mr. Baines.</i>
<i>You probably don't know your own strength.</i>

1167
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:35,378
I didn't push her.

1168
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:40,947
Why did the boy ask you,
'Was it self-defense...

1169
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:43,388
<i>as in Africa??</i>

1170
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:46,392
Ive never been out of the country.

1171
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:50,123
- Never?
- <i>Well, except once, to Ostend.</i>

1172
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:54,531
Very well, Mr. Baines. Would you come
into the other room? And you too, miss.

1173
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,741
- And whose room is this?
- A guest room.

1174
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:05,745
Where were you when it happened,
when the scream came, hmm?

1175
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:07,815
Yes?

1176
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,084
There.

1177
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:15,520
Although there had been a struggle outside
and angry words, according to Mr. Baines?

1178
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,759
I couldn't do anything else.

1179
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:23,490
I should have thought
you'd have got up and tried to hide.

1180
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,498
I couldn't.

1181
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,501
I'm sorry to have to ask you
all these questions.

1182
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:32,300
- You then dressed in a great hurry, I suppose.
- Of course.

1183
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:34,307
That would be after the scream.

1184
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:36,309
Yes.

1185
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:39,812
How long was that
after the child called out?

1186
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:42,144
I don't know.

1187
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,651
Two, three minutes.
I don't know.

1188
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:49,053
- The child said he never called out.
- He must be lying.

1189
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,684
It's obvious somebody must be lying.

1190
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:56,059
When you dressed,
what did you do?

1191
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:58,064
He showed me out.

1192
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:01,966
<i>Wouldn't it have been wiser,</i>
<i>and more honest, to have stayed?</i>

1193
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:06,973
He wanted to keep me out of it.
I was frightened because of our lies.

1194
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,702
I don't understand you.

1195
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,573
Then I - I can't explain to you.

1196
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:15,581
<i>How long had you known Mr. Baines?</i>

1197
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:19,244
Ever since I started to work
at the embassy- seven months.

1198
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:22,050
- <i>Without Mrs. Baines's knowledge?</i>
- Yes.

1199
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:25,422

<i>carrying on an affair with each other.</i>

1200
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:41,533
- We are very busy here.
- Won't be a moment.

1201
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,110

Thank you.

1211

Did you ever discuss marriage?

No.

But your relations with this man
were intimate.

1214

- We love each other.
- And intimacy took place during that period?

We don't talk the same language.
I don't know what you mean.

- Oh, leave her alone, can't you?

Don't worry.
It's his duty to ask questions.

Last night was the first time
we were ever alone like this.

1219

Now, you take your photographs
and fingerprints and everything.

1220
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,140
It's love you'll photograph,
not 'intimacy.'

What do you want, sonny?

1222

Youve got to leave Baines alone.
He didn't do it.

- Didn't do what?
- He didn't murder her!

1224

Why did you say 'murder,' Phillipe?

1225
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,398
No one has mentioned murder.

He didn't do it.

1229

Well, if he didn't do it...

Hmm?

1232
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:30,139
I did. My thumbmark's
downstairs on the banister.

Come on.

01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:41,387
- I'll take him upstairs.
- No, Mr. Baines, it might be better
if you kept away from the boy.

1236
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:43,464
What, are you charging me?

1237
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,965
I would advise you
to reconsider your story.

1238
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:48,729
Youve already admitted that you were
both quarreling at the top of the stairs.

<i>Perhaps there was a push</i>

- He's quite right, Baines.

1242
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,411
- Think carefully.
- I don't have to think! It's the truth!

Run along, sonny.

- <i>I don't think you'd better, miss.</i>

1245
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,453
There's questions to be asked, and the less
either of you see the boy the better.

1246
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,456
- Are you forbidding me?
- No, I'm advising you. That's all.

1247

- In your interest and Mr. Baines's.
- Well, I know his interests better than you do.

01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:15,887
As you please, miss.

1249

- <i>I'm all right.</i>

1250
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:23,963
Listen, youve got to stop telling these lies.
It's only silly. It makes things much worse.

1251
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:27,496
It doesn't. Weve got to think of lies
and tell them all the time.

1252
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,203
Then they won't find out the truth.

1253

But Baines didn't do it, Phillipe!

1254
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:35,248
She hit me.
Baines doesn't let people hit me.

1255
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,444
Of course he doesn't.
But he'd never kill anyone. You must know that.

1256
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:42,751
- Why, he did in Africa.
- Oh, that's one of his stories.
He's never been to Africa.

1257

Baines doesn't tell me lies.

The truth can't harm Baines.
Don't you realize he's innocent?

1261
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:58,968
- Oh, if there could only have been a witness.
- What's a witness?

01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,337
Someone who saw.

1263
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:04,775
Couldn't I say
that I saw somebody?

- Yes, you must. Now, you promise?

1268
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,954

- All right. Now you go and tell them
that you told a lot of lies.

1269
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,256
Mr. Baines, it would be
much more satisfactory...

1270
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:25,298
if you'd consent to come along with us
just to make a formal statement.

1271
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,301
And more convenient
for the embassy too, I should think.

01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:30,303
Do I have to?

Youve got to decide it yourself, Baines.

They can't force you to leave here.

1275

They can't arrest you
so long as you are an embassy employee.

1276

Of course,
we could appeal to the ambassador.

- Ive told you lies.

I'd strongly advise you, Mr. Baines -

01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:50,891
- Mrs. Baines did hit me.
- Yes, yes. You shouldn't tell lies.

I only wanted to help Baines.
Please.
