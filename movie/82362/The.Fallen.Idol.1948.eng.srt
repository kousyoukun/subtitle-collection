00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:52,117
(Bells Chiming)

2
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,757
Good day, sir.

3
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,005
In his offce there, miss.

4
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,792
Uh, Baines, is, uh...
is the ambassador's car at the door?

5
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:17,294
- It's waiting, sir.
- His Excellency has been delayed.
He'll drive straight to the airport.

6
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,365
Of course.

7
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,869
(Chattering)

8
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,135
- (Speaking French)
- Oh, uh, Baines, fiowers for her room.

9
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:33,702
You know the sort my wife likes. After eight
months in a hospital the place must look like home.

10
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,838
She'll fnd everything
just as she left it, sir.

11
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,645
The doctors don't yet know
if they'll permit her to fiy.

12
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,413
- The journey will be a strain.
- Master Phillipe, sir.

13
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,152
He should have his hair cut.
He looks as if we've neglected him.

14
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,991
- Any message for your mother, Phillipe?
- Tell her I've got something to show her.

15
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,588
That will bring her home.
Look after the embassy while I'm away.

16
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,759
Be back on Monday morning
with my wife, I hope.

17
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:59,326
(Man) I hope so too, Your Excellency.
It's been a long time.

18
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,373
Papa. Papa.

19
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,451
Au revoir, Papa.
(Continues In French)

20
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,850
(Speaking French)

21
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,038
Hello, Macgregor.

22
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,109
Aw.

23
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,345
Hello, Macgregor. Hello.

24
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,082
Come on. Come on. Hmm.

25
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,622
Come on.

26
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,622
Oh.

27
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,627
Look. London.

28
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,683
(Baines)
Good day, sir.

29
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,724
Baines.

30
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,064
Baines!

31
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,077
- One of her moods again.
- Always some grouse.

32
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,418
Not healthy to be as clean as all that.

33
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,686
You be careful, sonny.
Mrs. Baines is on the warpath again.

34
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,591
(Woman #2)
Anyway, these foreigners like a bit of dirt.

35
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,995
(Woman #1) Poor kid. Be a good thing
for him when his mother gets back.

36
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,803
Master Phillipe, just because
your father's away for a couple of days...

37
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,270
you mustn't think
you can run wild all over the house.

38
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,468
- No, Mrs. Baines.
- I've got plenty to do without clearing up after you.

39
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,068
What's that you've got in your hand?
Show me. What is it?

40
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,079
Piece of chalk.

41
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,149
You've been making marks
all over the fioor again?

42
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,185
- Well? Have you?
- Just little marks.

43
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,050
Give me the chalk.
Come on. Give it to me.

44
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,351
Have you done what
I told you to do, Master Phillipe?

45
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,688
Done what?

46
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,854
- Got rid of it.
- Yes.

47
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,263
You know what happens
to little boys who tell lies?

48
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,801
I won't have any vermin
in any house I run.

49
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,531
Did you put it where I told you to?
Down the lavatory?

50
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,268
- Did you? Answer me. Did you?
- Yes.

51
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,436
What are you hiding in your pockets?

52
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,639
Bring your hand out.
Show me. Come along.

53
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,582
Only toffees.

54
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,518
I won't have you eating between meals,
Master Phillipe. Give them to me.

55
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,682
You need a mother's care.
I've tried to do it for months.

56
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,284
Is that all you've got? Run along,
and try and not get into mischief.

57
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,659
It's diffcult enough
with half the staff away.

58
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,266
- See you on Monday, Mr. Baines.
- Have a good weekend, Harry.

59
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,237
Get out of it.

60
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,239
Can't you see I'm busy?

61
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,571
Can't you pick on someone else?

62
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,908
Well, since you are here,
you might as well do a job of work.

63
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,448
- Get on with that.
- Look. Macgregor.

64
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,713
Oh. Hmm.

65
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,721
Looking well this morning, isn't he?

66
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,314
- Have you got a little box for him?
- Little box?

67
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,318
- Hmm. Might fnd something.
- Will you take me for a walk this afternoon, Baines?

68
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,594
Well, I might, if you work hard enough.
I might. We'll see.

69
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,669
Quite a lot to be done.

70
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,170
This is exciting...
your mother coming back... isn't it?

71
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,435
Yes, but, you know,
I don't remember her very well.

72
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,569
Have a glass of pop, Phile. Spot of drink
will do us good. Give us an appetite for dinner.

73
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,581
- I am having my meals down here, aren't I?
- Of course.

74
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,277
- What have you got for chop?
- Chop?

75
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,479
You said that was
what food was called in Africa.

76
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,025
- Oh, yes, of course. Chop.
- Tell me more about Africa.

77
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,554
- Another time.
- Was is it hot there?

78
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,598
You never felt such heat.
Not... Not even where you come from.

79
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,158
Not a nice heat, mind you,
like you get in the park on a day like this.

80
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,171
The white man's grave, they call it.

81
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,106
Wet. Smelling of rot.

82
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,643
- What does rot smell of?
- Eh?

83
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,872
Oh, the opposite to this.

84
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,542
(Sniffng)
I smell that carbolic stuff.

85
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,848
When there's nothing
but carbolic round you hanker after rot.

86
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,115
Mmm. I understand.

87
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,453
- Hmm.
- It reeks of chains.

88
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,459
Yes. Hmm.

89
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,395
- It's a man's life out there, Phile.
- But why did you leave Africa?

90
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,865
Why? Oh, um,
get married, you know.

91
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,493
Wasn't there anybody to marry
out there in Africa?

92
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,902
Oh, yes. Plenty.
But they weren't white.

93
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,805
- Must they be white?
- Um... Hmm.

94
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,208
Ah, Mrs. Patterson.
What are you doing with those?

95
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,304
- Mrs. Baines told us to fll 'em.
- Where's Dolly and the others?

96
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:13,351
The weekend off. The place is empty except for
Mrs. Baines, Phile and me. We carry on.

97
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,751
- Phile, drink up the pop and lend a hand with this.
- Don't overwork him, Mr. Baines.

98
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,756
Got to make a living like everybody else.

99
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,758
- Does everybody make a living?
- Everybody.

100
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,556
- Even Papa?
- Just a slave really.

101
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,224
- Not an easy life like us.
- Can you make a living in Africa?

102
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,496
(Mr. Baines) Make a living?
You can make a fortune. Make anything you like.

103
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,503
Make elephants and kings and castles.

104
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,403
Yes. And shoot 'em too.

105
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,341
- If they don't get you.
- Can I show her the gun?

106
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,436
(Patterson)
Don't you dare. Leave it where it is.

107
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,072
It's not loaded,
and Baines keeps the safety catch on.

108
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,844
Leave it be, Phile.

109
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,887
- It's got bullets too!
- Phile...

110
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,457
(Mr. Baines Whispers)
Phile.

111
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,725
So there you are.
Holding up the work again?

112
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,425
- There's still plenty to do.
- We'll get it fnished.

113
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:05,197
- By sitting around here all day long?
- Good morning, Mr. Baines. Till Monday.

114
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,932
- Ta, ta.
- No business to keep that gun in the house.

115
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,975
Come along, Master Phillipe.
Sit down there. Get on to that salad.

116
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,545
Baines is going to take me
for a walk this afternoon.

117
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,705
No, he isn't.
Not with all this work to do.

118
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,783
- There'll be time enough for both.
- Oh, please.

119
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,283
Work frst,
and pleasure afterwards.

120
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,181
Easy to see you've been eating
between meals, Master Phillipe.

121
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,423
- I'm sick to death of your ways, spoiling the boy.
- He didn't. I took it.

122
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,863
- Lying again, Master Phillipe?
- There's lies and lies.

123
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,731
- What do you mean by that?
- Some lies are just kindness.

124
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,805
Kindness?

125
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,874
Temper, temper. I won't have you
swearing in front of the boy.

126
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,570
- Do go on, Master Phillipe. What are you waiting for?
- I don't want any.

127
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,876
Master Phillipe, do as you're told
and eat it up. Go along.

128
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,907
Why don't you let Baines
take me for a walk?

129
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,010
Because I say so.

130
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,656
I hate you.

131
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,989
Master Phillipe,
you'll say you're sorry for that.

132
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,599
I'm not sorry.

133
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:13,138
Very well. Go straight upstairs to the nursery,
and you'll stay there for the whole afternoon.

134
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,003
Do you hear me?
Go along. Up, up, up!

135
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,585
(Mrs. Baines)
Get along with you. Go along.

136
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,655
I don't care.

137
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,733
(Imitating Airplane Engine)

138
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,143
Hello, Macgregor.

139
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,514
Look. You're very pretty, you know.

140
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,584
(Man Shouts)

141
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,793
(Man Shouts)

142
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,163
(Door Closes)

143
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,071
(Blows)

144
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,231
Baines.!

145
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,899
(Blows)
Baines!

146
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,516
Quick. Come on, Macgregor.

147
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,643
I got you.

148
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,233
Ah!

149
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,247
- Baines!
- Mustn't come in here, sonny.

150
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,288
- Isn't Mr. Baines here?
- No. Hasn't been in here yet.

151
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,056
Baines!

152
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,793
Phile.

153
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:26,058
- What are you doing here?
- I saw you through the window.

154
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,733
Are you by yourself?

155
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,735
Yes.

156
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,006
You gave me a start.

157
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,408
- I thought it would be funny.
- Yes. It's funny. Of course it's funny.

158
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,482
- Phile, this is Julie.
- How do you do?

159
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,816
Have a bun.

160
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,721
He spells his name queer.
P-H-l-L-E. Phile.

161
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,528
Oh, she... she hasn't got an appetite, isn't eating.
You can have both of them.

162
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,594
You don't need to take any notice of us.

163
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,570
- Got a glass of milk?
- (Woman) I think I've got a drop.

164
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,641
Well, go and get it, Phile.

165
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,179
I wish I were dead.

166
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,875
(Whispering)

167
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,758
It wouldn't work.

168
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,288
There are things have got to be said.

169
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,629
If you'd like another cake, you can
go to the counter and change it, Phile.

170
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,362
No.

171
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,200
This is how I see it, Julie.

172
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:46,108
This, uh, girl you're talking about.
This, uh...

173
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,145
This friend of yours.

174
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:54,050
She... She... likes the fellow,
doesn't she?

175
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,121
It's real, I mean?

176
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,925
L 'amour?

177
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,993
L 'amour eternel.

178
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,429
The things you say, Julie.

179
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,329
The way you put things.

180
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,427
What I mean is you...

181
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,631
can't break a thing like that.

182
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,935
Not just by going away,
leaving no trace, going home.

183
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,377
She wouldn't be going home.

184
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,781
- Home is here.
- Her own country I mean.

185
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,854
Wouldn't work, Julie.

186
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,421
There'd be her,
as it were you, and...

187
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,051
him, as it were me...

188
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,291
and all that distance between them.

189
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,433
Like this table.

190
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,504
It wouldn't work.

191
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,273
He'd go crazy, Julie...

192
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,970
hoping every time the post came.

193
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,339
Not being able to write.

194
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,416
Oh, he'd... he'd forget.

195
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,417
There wouldn't be much to remember.

196
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,183
For seven months, ever since she came
to the embassy, seeing her every day...

197
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,123
Not speaking because of
people looking on.

198
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,161
Like this.

199
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,197
Give it... Give it time, Julie.

200
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,734
- But it's torture.
- What's torture?

201
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,032
(Both Speaking French)

202
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,675
- What's he say?
- He says he's had pain too. It soon goes.

203
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:37,120
But this... girlfriend of yours, Julie.
She doesn't have to go away.

204
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,817
- While there's life there's hope.
- There's always hope.

205
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,985
Things happen. Things change.

206
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,531
People don't change. He's tied.

207
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,760
She wouldn't like him so much
if he didn't feel tied.

208
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,768
I can't believe it.

209
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,499
- I can't believe we'll go out of here
and say good-bye and never...
- (Whispers) Careful.

210
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,011
(Sighs, Sniffies)

211
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,048
Have you got a handkerchief?

212
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,447
No.

213
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,044
No. Have you got one, Phile?
She's got something in her eye.

214
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,719
- Mine's clean.
- Well, let her have it, Phile.

215
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,263
Pull the top bit over the other one.
That's what I always do.

216
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:23,460
There... There's nothing
fxed yet, is there?

217
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,560
The... The boat I mean.

218
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,639
- The day after tomorrow.
- Monday?

219
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,300
Can I have this one too
if you don't want it?

220
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:40,717
They couldn't stand it forever,
meeting in tea shops and cinemas.

221
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,117
All the diffculties and lies.

222
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,487
- He's not that kind of man.
- What kind of man is he?

223
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,985
Good and kind.

224
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,326
- Can't hurt anyone.
- What a fool the man is.

225
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,230
That's what I think too.

226
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,440
- Here's your handkerchief, Phillipe.
- I've got to see you tomorrow, Julie.

227
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,668
It's no good.
You've got to take him home now.

228
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,643
Listen. I'll ring you somehow.
There's so much I have to say.

229
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,681
It's all been said over and over again.

230
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,444
- Good-bye.
- I don't know what to do.

231
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,020
You don't need to do anything.

232
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,089
Nothing.

233
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,526
She does make a fuss
about her friend, doesn't she?

234
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,370
Can I have some tea in my milk?

235
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,445
It's sad about her friend, isn't it?

236
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,947
Is Julie your niece or something?

237
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,493
- How much is that, please?
- One and eight pence.

238
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,076
The cup that cheers.

239
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,474
Come on, Phile.

240
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,478
- (Bell Jingles)
- I'm sorry I gave you a start.

241
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,990
That's all right, Phile.

242
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,899
- Is that car a Ford?
- I didn't see.

243
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,264
Oh, look.
There's your niece again.

244
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,344
Look. I'll speak to her tonight.

245
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,046
I'll say to her, "What's the use?
You and I don't get on anymore."

246
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,214
And then I'll tell her everything.
Perhaps she'll see it.

247
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,224
She'll never let you go.

248
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:05,956
She might. Anyway, we've one last day.
I must see you tomorrow. Just the last time.

249
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,032
I'll telephone you.

250
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,700
- Promise?
- (Phillipe) Baines, it is a Ford.

251
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,642
I promise.

252
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,733
Oh, look.
There's Mrs. Baines on the balcony.

253
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,467
Need we go in yet?

254
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,475
Listen, Phile. I...

255
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,412
I don't want you...

256
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,881
I don't ask you to say
what isn't true, but...

257
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,920
there's no need to mention
to Mrs. Baines that you metJulie.

258
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,718
- Is it a secret?
- That's right, Phile. Our secret.

259
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,284
You see, Mrs. Baines...
She... She doesn't likeJulie.

260
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:16,026
It was stupid of me to meet her so near home,
but I'd got to see she was all right.

261
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,625
Of course you had.
You can trust me, Baines.

262
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,365
Mrs. Baines'll get it out of you
if she can.

263
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,271
Oh, I'll never let you down, Baines.

264
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:28,437
Funny, isn't it? Julie working for the embassy
and all this time she was your niece.

265
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,276
Yes. It's a scream.

266
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,749
Need we go in yet?

267
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,015
- Come on, Phile.
- Take me for a walk in the park.

268
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,317
Here. Phile.

269
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,291
Give me your handkerchief.

270
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,624
It's things like that give secrets away.

271
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,064
Isn't it exciting, Baines?

272
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,068
Good night, Macgregor.

273
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,012
Bonsoir.
(Kisses)

274
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,082
(Speaks French)

275
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,330
Oh. What are you doing?

276
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,661
just looking.

277
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,258
- What at?
- Nothing.

278
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,361
I suppose you were doing nothing
this afternoon... you and Mr. Baines.

279
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,872
- Well?
- No.

280
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,671
We'll see about that later.

281
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,941
Come along now.
Off you go.

282
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,242
I've got work to do. Come on.

283
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,915
Now what are you waiting for?
You can see I'm busy, can't you?

284
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,458
Get along with you. Downstairs.
Hurry up.

285
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,952
Come down from there!
Get down at once!

286
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,955
No. No, don't.
No. You wait. Wait, wait, wait.

287
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,992
Master Phillipe,
come away from there at once.

288
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,588
Do I have to come and drag you away?

289
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,931
Right. Come here.
Do you hear me? Give me your hands.

290
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,740
Oh, now look what you've done.

291
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,404
And all over my shoes.
Dirt. Nothing but dirt.

292
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:46,314
No. No. No, you don't. It stays there.
Stay there for your mother to see.

293
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,648
Show her the sort of tricks
you get up to.

294
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,745
- Get along. Don't ever let me fnd you on there again.
- I'm sorry.

295
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,588
just for that, you shall have your supper in
the nursery. Your tray's downstairs. Go fetch it.

296
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,662
- I'm sorry.
- And no more chatting with Baines.

297
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,424
Take your tray and go straight upstairs.
I'll fetch it later.

298
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,685
She knows we were out,
but I haven't told her a thing.

299
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,912
just slip along upstairs now, Phile.

300
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,354
She told me to fetch my tray.
I've got to have it upstairs.

301
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,449
There it is.

302
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,427
I put Macgregor to bed.
She nearly caught me.

303
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,158
Phile, I'd say I'm sorry about it.

304
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,598
- You know. Lunchtime.
- Hmm.

305
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,569
If my mother does come back on Monday,
it won't make any difference to us, will it?

306
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,640
Not a bit.

307
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,256
I'm sorry I said I hated you.

308
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,325
It's all right.

309
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,926
(Mrs. Baines)
I said you weren't to take him out.

310
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,730
(Mr. Baines)
I didn't take him out. I brought him home.

311
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,532
You went out by the back door...

312
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,575
he by the fre escape,
and you two met outside.

313
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,373
Phile's been out on his own.
So have I.

314
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,845
I told him he wasn't to go out,
and you take him.

315
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,247
(Mr. Baines)
Oh, don't let's talk about him.

316
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,152
- There's something more important.
- What could that be?

317
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,223
You and I.

318
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,161
Go on.

319
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,461
Well, I've tried to make a go of it.

320
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,659
And so have you.

321
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,669
But we only make each other miserable.

322
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,104
It's years now since there's been a day
without some blessed row.

323
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,511
- We can't go on like this.
- You want your freedom?

324
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,114
You don't want me around anymore.

325
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,811
This is something new,
this kind of talk.

326
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,888
I've thought about it long enough.

327
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:09,820
- And now it's time tell you. Because...
- You go off, and see what happens to me.

328
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:14,262
- (Mr. Baines) Oh, don't talk like that.
- (Mrs. Baines) You do as you say.
You and your freedom.

329
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,164
You'll feel fiine when you read it
in the Sunday newspapers.

330
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,760
You'll be able to say, "That's me. I did that. "
That'll make you feel happy.

331
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,840
Oh, don't talk so foolish.

332
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,637
Oh, go and give the boy his supper.

333
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,646
We'll talk about it later.

334
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,745
(Door Opens)

335
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,347
You know your father
doesn't like you going out alone.

336
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,918
- Funny you should meet Baines, wasn't it?
- Yes.

337
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,691
He likes wandering about
on his own too.

338
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,632
- Not much appetite, have you, Master Phillipe?
- No, Mrs. Baines.

339
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,102
Why don't you try eating some of that
nice pudding? You don't eat enough.

340
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,038
Don't eat enough to keep a fiy alive.
No lunch and...

341
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,373
and now no supper, Master Phillipe.

342
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,047
So that's why you've lost your appetite,
Master Phillipe.

343
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,245
Been eating between meals.
Buying cream buns again.

344
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,845
- That's not what your pocket money is for.
- I didn't.

345
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,858
Don't lie to me, Master Phillipe. You're going to be
a fne worry to your mother when I tell her.

346
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,895
I will not put up with any more lies.
You're becoming a regular little liar!

347
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,830
- I won't put up with any more lies from you!
- They gave it to me!

348
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,299
- They?
- Baines I mean.

349
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,338
"They."

350
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,878
Oh.

351
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,544
So that's it.

352
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,782
Yes.

353
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,993
You mustn't mind Mrs. Baines,
Master Phillipe.

354
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:55,089
She, um... She lets her tongue
run away with her.

355
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,496
We have a secret now...

356
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,936
you and I...

357
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,838
that I know all about them.

358
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,843
Can you keep a secret?

359
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,413
- Yes.
- Good.

360
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,879
I suppose she was having tea with him.

361
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,113
just tea. No cakes.

362
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,056
Is she young?

363
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,854
Of course. She's his niece.

364
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,895
So that's what he said.

365
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,896
(Chuckles)
The old scoundrel.

366
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:31,162
It's all right. She's not seeing him anymore.
Tomorrow she's going away.

367
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,602
Is she? Tomorrow.

368
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,702
You can keep our secret now?
Hmm? Yes?

369
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,779
Yes.

370
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:50,117
You do, and I'll get you
that 2A Meccano set.

371
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,404
Do you want the light up there?

372
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:15,605
(Mrs. Baines) He hasn't eaten his supper.
Think he'd be hungry after his long walk.

373
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,806
(Mr. Baines)
Wait till I put on the light.

374
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:22,319
(Mrs. Baines) I don't think I want to go on
with our talk tonight, if you don't mind.

375
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:27,013
You know when you two
were out this afternoon?

376
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,094
- What? Me and Phile?
- Yes.

377
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:33,722
I thought to myself,
"Perhaps I stay indoors too much.

378
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,630
I ought to get out more,
take some time off."

379
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:40,568
- I've been telling you that for weeks.
- Yes. So you have.

380
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,607
I think it might be a very good idea.

381
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,024
You asleep, Phile?

382
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,572
(Door Closes)

383
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:37,852
Come on, Phile. Time to wake up.
(Clicking Tongue)

384
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,987
Come on, Phile. Up you get.

385
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,932
Where's Mrs. Baines?

386
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:47,903
- She's gone to see her Aunt Hilda.
- No. Why?

387
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,874
Said she needed an outing, Phile.
Like you and me.

388
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,935
- When will she come back?
- Not until tomorrow morning.

389
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,610
- Are we really alone?
- Of course we are.
We're going to spend the day together.

390
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,051
- Will we be alone all day, Baines?
- We'll be together, Phile.

391
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,123
It's misty still.

392
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,093
The cat's been out all night.
There she is, sniffng round the railings.

393
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,425
There's Doris shaking the mats out.

394
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,931
It's a great life if you don't weaken.

395
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,901
- It's early, isn't it?
- It's going to be a long day, Phile.

396
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,403
Now, you get dressed,
and I'll be cooking the sausages.

397
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,637
(Mr. Baines)
Yes. To see her aunt.

398
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,473
I'm quite alone, you understand?

399
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,776
No. Not about that. No.
I'll explain it all.

400
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,415
Oh, you must come.
You promised you would.

401
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,420
We'll have the whole day together.

402
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,389
Oh, it makes no difference
about the boy.

403
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,221
Yes. Uh, back here to supper, Julie.

404
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:47,424
Ah, of course it's safe. I... Well, I'm so
looking forward to seeing you, Julie.

405
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,432
I must talk to you.

406
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,266
I'll... I'll wait for you.
Of course I'll wait for you.

407
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,932
It'll amuse the boy,
and we'll be able to talk.

408
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,941
No. Of course he doesn't understand.

409
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,910
3:00, and we'll be able to talk quietly.

410
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,981
(Roars)

411
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,248
I'd rather see the snakes, Baines.

412
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,816
I was sure you'd like the lions.
My old legs are getting tired.

413
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,295
- You're not so old, Baines.
- I'm not so young as I used to be.

414
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,730
I'll tell you what.
Let's sit down over there.

415
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,099
I'll tell you things.
Then we'll go to the reptile house.

416
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,206
Did you shoot lions in Africa?

417
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,175
Oh, just a few. I mostly let them live.

418
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:37,373
- You shot a man though, Baines.
- Who told you that?

419
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,677
You did.
You murdered him, you said.

420
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,844
Murdered?
I never murdered anyone.

421
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,754
You said you killed someone,
once in Africa with that gun.

422
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:51,261
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, well, that wasn't murder, Phile.
That was self-defense.

423
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,297
You see, one day the blackies planned
what they call a rising.

424
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,163
I was the only white man
for miles around.

425
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,704
Well, this chap...
He called himself a king.

426
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,797
He got the blackies properly
worked up, speechifying.

427
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,808
They...

428
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,844
(Phillipe)
Yes? Go on. Go on.

429
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,675
Uh, th-they all came up to my hut.

430
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,047
Hundreds of them.
Knives, spears, clubs.

431
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,679
- Well, all I had was that... that gun I showed you.
- Go on.

432
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,850
"Clear off," I said to that king of theirs.
"Hop it," I said.

433
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,621
- (Hiccups)
- But he was after my blood.

434
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,129
Well, if they'd got me,
it wouldn't have ended there.

435
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,495
They'd have tasted blood.

436
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,262
- Like those lions there.
- Th-Then what happened?

437
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,367
Oh, I plugged him. Then I threw the gun away
and went in with my fsts.

438
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,534
But you found the gun again.

439
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,944
Oh, yeah. Yes. So I did.
I'll tell you about that one day.

440
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:47,506
I wish I could
go away with you to Africa.

441
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,088
Oh, look. There's your niece.

442
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,754
Oh, yes. So it is.

443
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:00,297
Now can we go and see
the reptile house?

444
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,600
- Look. Would you like an ice cream, Phile?
- I wouldn't say no, Baines.

445
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,968
Well, here's a bob. Get one forJulie too.
There you are. Over there.

446
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,303
What did she...

447
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,709
- Did you tell her?
- No.

448
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,548
I couldn't get around to it somehow.
And then she went away.

449
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,642
- Two wafers, please.
- Two wafers.

450
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,883
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

451
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:35,625
- Then everything's just the same.
- Give me time. I'll manage it somehow.

452
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,724
- There's your ice cream.
- Thank you, Phillipe.

453
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,201
I've been telling Julie
she's gotta have supper with us.

454
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,000
But you asked on the telephone,
and she said she would.

455
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,167
- The things you know.
- It would only be worse afterwards.

456
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,640
She doesn't trust my cooking, Phile.

457
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:54,116
- Oh, can't we see the snakes, Baines?
- Of course we're going to see the snakes.

458
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,790
Hello, polly.
I'd like to fnd a snake like Macgregor.

459
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,359
- (Julie) Who's Macgregor?
- (Phillipe) It's a secret.

460
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,655
We don't need to have secrets from Julie.

461
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,629
- (Squawking)
- (Phillipe) Are you scared to come back home?

462
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,326
- Scared of what?
- Mrs. Baines.

463
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,460
Look, Phile. There...
There's the reptile house. Over there.

464
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,379
Ah. You are pretty.

465
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,144
(Gasps)

466
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,312
- What time's the boat train?
- 9:00.

467
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,152
Can you get food on the train?

468
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,423
I'm taking sandwiches.

469
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,301
Newhaven - Dieppe?

470
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,370
Dover - Calais.

471
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,842
Have you packed?

472
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,843
Of course I have.

473
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,845
Oh, stop looking after me.

474
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,175
Oh, dear.

475
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,376
Baines.

476
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,319
- Do come and have a look at the snake.
- Is it as nice as Macgregor?

477
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,415
- Oh, you've told her.
- I said we don't have secrets from Julie.

478
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,723
- I do.
- Macgregor wouldn't be frightened of me, would he?

479
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,696
There's only one person
in the whole world he's frightened of.

480
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,994
- (Julie) And who's that?
- Mrs. Baines.

481
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,035
(Squawking)

482
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,070
Baines!

483
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,736
- (Barking)
- Baines!

484
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,038
(Barking Continues)

485
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,115
Oh, look, Baines.
Come and look at this.

486
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,450
- (No Audible Dialogue)
- Baines.! What are they doing?

487
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,524
(Monkey Screeches)

488
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,223
Here.
(Whistles)

489
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,981
Where's Phile?

490
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,743
- Oh. There he is.
- Phile.!

491
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,648
Time to be off.
She's coming back, Phile.

492
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,884
We'll all three have supper together.

493
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:18,519
(Phile Chuckles)
Wouldn't Mrs. Baines be angry if she knew!

494
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,731
- Suppose she came back after all?
- She won't do that. Not when her mind's made up.

495
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,705
She... She doesn't know
about yesterday, does she?

496
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,777
No. Phile's a wonder for secrets.

497
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,747
- Is it very important to keep secrets?
- It certainly is.

498
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,843
- Even if you don't like the person?
- That makes no difference.

499
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,650
Even Mrs. Baines's secrets?

500
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,519
Yes, Phillipe.
Even Mrs. Baines's secrets.

501
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,375
I'll just go and open up.

502
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,951
This is a "man's hole." You can get
right down to the sewers through here.

503
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,892
- You're very fond of Baines, aren't you, Phillipe?
- Of course.

504
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,895
But you don't like girls.

505
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,397
Baines doesn't either. Not really.

506
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,436
Come in, you two.

507
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,130
Telegram! Telegram!
Can I open it?

508
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,139
If you like.

509
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,200
This is our kitchenette.

510
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,677
Handy for getting a cup of tea.

511
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,748
It's from Mrs. Baines.

512
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,023
(Mr. Baines)
Her aunt's not well.

513
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,150
She won't be back for a day or two.

514
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,558
Do you think it's true?

515
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:02,723
True? Why, yes. Of course it's true.
She wouldn't say it if it wasn't. Would she?

516
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,735
Does Mrs. Baines keep secrets?

517
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,805
We don't want to waste
good time cooking.

518
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,374
Got plenty of tins.
What we want's a good spread...

519
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,909
and every man his own drink.

520
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,844
(Phillipe) How long does
a telegram take to get to a place?

521
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,881
(Mr. Baines)
Depends where it comes from.

522
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,611
(Phillipe)
I'm going to make a dart of this one.

523
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,812
(Mr. Baines)
Move along now, Phile. Move along.

524
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,015
- (Phillipe) Do telegrams cost much?
- (Mr. Baines) Oh, don't natter.

525
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,592
Couldn't we eat out here?

526
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:35,165
We could easily make a...
table out of some of the cases.

527
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,791
- Don't you think?
- Yes. Of course.

528
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,737
- It would be a picnic.
- Oh, must we have a picnic?

529
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,072
- Well, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Can I feed Macgregor frst?

530
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,510
Of course you can,
while I'm taking out the things.

531
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,581
- Can I come too, Phillipe?
- Show her Macgregor.

532
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,916
Mmm. But won't you need me here?

533
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,250
Oh, I think I can manage.

534
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,551
Mrs. Baines doesn't like Macgregor.

535
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,561
- She doesn't, huh?
- She doesn't like you either.

536
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,757
What do you mean? Phile.

537
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,800
What do you mean she doesn't like me?

538
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,927
She doesn't like anybody really.
But Baines doesn't like her.

539
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:18,134
- How do you know?
- She won't give him his... freedom.

540
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,876
- Did he ask her?
- Oh, yes. I heard him. But I didn't mean to listen.

541
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,211
No, no. I'm... I'm sure you didn't.

542
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,980
- When was this?
- Yesterday after Baines and I came back.

543
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:34,217
- What did he say, Phile?
- "I want my freedom."Just like that.

544
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,783
And she went on. Natter, natter.
Always nattering.

545
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,864
Poor Baines.
He did want it so badly.

546
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,798
When she comes back
I'll ask her for my freedom too.

547
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,029
That was a good dart.
Why did you throw it away?

548
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,163
Oh, I can make lots more like that.

549
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,539
- What room is this?
- The guest room.

550
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,203
For very important people.

551
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,874
- Oh. It's very pretty.
- Macgregor lives here.

552
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,952
Supper.

553
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,850
- What's the matter?
- He's gone.

554
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,489
- (Whimpers)
- How could he have got out?

555
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,725
She must have killed him.
(Sobbing)

556
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:24,138
- (Sobbing)
- It's just a bit of bad luck you've got to take.

557
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,505
(Phillipe)
She never really liked him.

558
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,545
- She said he was vermin.
- Well, tomorrow we'll...

559
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,672
we'll put up a little stone
in the garden...

560
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,682
and we'll write his name on it.

561
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:38,721
"Macgregor, killed by Mrs. Baines."

562
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,586
- And the date.
- No, no. No. Not that.

563
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,592
Something like...

564
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:47,653
"My Macgregor.
Very lovely he was in his life."

565
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,256
And then the date.

566
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:54,929
No. We... We'll just have "Macgregor."

567
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,065
That'll be plenty.
We'll remember.

568
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,506
How about a bite of supper?
Then we'll play a game.

569
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,048
Come on.

570
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,587
Well, sit down, Julie.
Let's... Let's have a drink to happier days.

571
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,588
Let me.

572
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,591
- Hey!
- Hey!

573
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,184
- (Screams)
- (Mr. Baines Shouts)

574
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,775
(Rustle)

575
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,045
(Squeaks)

576
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,149
 (Vocalizing)

577
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:57,359
There he is. What is it? I've caught a fsh?
Is it a rabbit or a roly-poly pudding?

578
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,266
(Both Laughing)

579
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:07,470
- Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?
- (Vocalizes)

580
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,570
We'll catch him this time.
We'll catch him and kill him.

581
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,115
Puss, puss, puss, puss,
puss, puss, puss, puss.

582
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,269
(Shouts)

583
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,271
(Phillipe Squealing)

584
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,783
Thunder and lightning! Lightning and thunder!
Terrible storm in the jungle now.

585
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,652
- (Squealing)
- I catch... I catch... I catch you.

586
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,452
- (Laughing)
- Oh, what a run.

587
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,527
(Pants)

588
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,665
(Mr. Baines)
Where is he? Phile? Bedtime.

589
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,032
- Come along.
- Phillipe.

590
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,037
Think he went along here.

591
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,439
Come on. Come on.
Where are you?

592
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,604
- Phillipe.
- No?

593
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,682
(Julie Whispers)

594
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,790
I'm only going because...

595
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,326
because it's not possible to stay.

596
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,591
All day long I've wanted
to talk to you, Julie.

597
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:38,327
Now's my last chance.
Now we're alone, I just want...

598
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,166
I just want you around always.

599
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,776
(Screams)

600
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,868
- (Gasping) Baines.
- (Mr. Baines) What is it?

601
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,970
- What's the matter?
- I saw...

602
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,845
- What frightened you?
- (Breathing Heavily)

603
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,919
I'm... I thought I saw a ghost.

604
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,079
Aw.
(Chuckles)

605
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,386
The game's gone on too long.
Come on. Upstairs.

606
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,371
Where are they?

607
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,139
Where are they?

608
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,411
Don't lie to me.

609
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,612
I know they're here.

610
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,316
(Whispering)
I have been here all the time.

611
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,620
That's not nice, Master Phillipe.

612
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,494
All I want to know is where they are.

613
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,829
I want...

614
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:48,928
I want to talk to them.
Help me. Help Mrs. Baines.

615
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,304
Master Phillipe, we... we've always
been friends, haven't we?

616
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,070
No.

617
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,306
We were friends, last night.

618
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,110
Do you remember that secret we had?
About them?

619
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,913
We didn't have a secret.

620
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,821
Oh, you know all about them.

621
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,190
You're not such a child
as you pretend to be.

622
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,856
You've got a nasty, wicked mind,
and it ought to be beaten out of you.

623
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,034
Phile? Phile?
Is that you?

624
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,179
Baines!

625
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,249
Look.!

626
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,918
(Screaming)

627
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,818
Help.! Help.!

628
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,992
She's in there!
You've got that girl in there!

629
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,860
- Now, wait a moment. Listen to me.
- I don't want to hear any excuses.

630
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,866
I know all about it. Let me get at her.
I'll tell her a thing or two.!

631
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,869
We can say what we've got to say to
each other downstairs. Don't make a scene.

632
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,872
Get out of my way!
Don't you tell me what to do!

633
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,000
You're a fne one to dictate to me!
How dare you! Let me go!

634
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,579
I'll put you and her in the gutter
before I'm fnished with you!

635
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,877
I'll give you something you'll remember
for the rest of your life!

636
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,951
Will you let me go!

637
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,885
Thought you had me safely out of the way,
didn't you? Hypocrite.!

638
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,050
And you.! You needn't go on
hiding in that room.! I recognized you.!

639
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,652
You needn't think you can come back here
on Monday to your safe littlejob.!

640
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,665
- I'll get you deported out of the country.!
- (Baines) Quiet.!

641
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,861
For heaven's sake,
don't go on like this.!

642
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,871
If you've no thought of yourself or of me,
at least think of the boy.

643
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:06,306
- Him? When I'm fnished with her,
I'll give him what he deserves!
- Be quiet!

644
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,039
He'll think twice before he starts on his
sneaking ways, the lying, beastly little brat.!

645
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,945
- Stop, or I'll lose my temper!
- (Mrs. Baines Whimpers)

646
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,711
Now, you go downstairs.

647
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:21,222
I'll join you, and we'll...

648
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,750
(Screaming)

649
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,661
(Whispers)
He pushed her.

650
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,119
Hello, sonny.

651
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,913
What are you up to?

652
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,927
Out a bit late, aren't you, sonny?

653
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,757
What's your name, sonny?

654
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,796
Come here.

655
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,307
Here.

656
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,920
Cold, sonny?

657
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,386
Come here.
Put this on.

658
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,392
How about
a nice, warm cup of tea?

659
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,728
Yes?

660
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,926
You would? Good.

661
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,737
Come on.

662
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,069
Yes?

663
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,679
Well, I'm going to have one anyway.

664
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,828
- Yes?
- And so I arrested her.

665
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,592
Well, Rose, what have you
got to say this time?

666
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,792
Nothing,
except it's not my turn yet.

667
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,870
Same address?

668
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,406
There we are.

669
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,433
- Now, round here. Come on.
- Come here.

670
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,638
Bring him here.

671
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,544
Who is he?

672
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,708
What's all this about?

673
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,115
I found him wandering about.

674
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,917
- Pickin' up kids now, are ya?
- Quiet, Rose.

675
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,924
Where do you live, sonny?

676
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,927
- He won't speak.
- Quite right.

677
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,930
Come on, sonny.
You come over here.

678
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,900
So, what have you been up to, eh?
Playing about, have you?

679
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:29,062
Come and sit over here.
There you are.

680
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:32,369
Now, then, what were you doing?

681
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,672
- Walking in your sleep, were you?
- That's all I was doing.

682
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,680
Remember where you live, sonny? Eh?

683
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,977
Come on. Try to think.

684
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,985
Come on, sonny.
There's nothing to be frightened of here.

685
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:45,748
Nothin' at all.

686
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,755
Shh. Shh.

687
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,757
We just want to help you, see.

688
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,828
You tell us where you live,
and we'll take you home.

689
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,902
Come on, sonny.
Tell us where you live.

690
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,344
See what you can do, Rose.

691
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,045
- Hello, deary. Where do you live?
- Rose, Rose.

692
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:14,742
- Not like that.
- Not like what?

693
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,046
- Well...
- Here! Not like what?

694
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:23,058
You know. Just fnd out where he lives
and tell him we'll take him there.

695
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,719
- Shall I take you home?
- Rose!

696
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,356
Can't you do it without...
without the smile?

697
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,366
just ask him naturally.

698
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,868
Naturally?

699
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,870
Come along, deary.

700
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:39,373
Now, you would like to come home
with me now, deary, wouldn't you?

701
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,603
That was all right, wasn't it?

702
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,145
Well, I can't say it any other way.!

703
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,340
- Now, you would, wouldn't you?
- Yes, please.

704
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,577
- There you are. You see?
- (Phone Rings)

705
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,779
Station offcer, Chelsea Police.

706
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,856
Yes, Doctor?

707
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:58,052
Serious? Fatal.

708
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:01,722
Come and sit over here.
Come on.

709
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,731
Tell me your name.

710
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,801
What time was that?

711
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:11,106
- Now then, come on. Tell me your name.
- Yes, Doctor. Of course.

712
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,334
(Rose)
What's the matter?

713
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,343
Come on.

714
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,572
Phillipe.

715
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,616
Phillipe? Phillipe what?

716
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,311
- (Sergeant) Yes.
- That's all.

717
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,479
Come on.

718
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:28,819
It's a bit long, isn't it?
You want a haircut.

719
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:32,588
I'll have one sent over.
Anything else I can do?

720
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,097
Phillipe? Phillipe what, eh?
Where do you live?

721
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,599
Come on, chum.
You pop your feet into these.

722
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,330
Oh! Aren't you a lucky boy!

723
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:44,271
Oh, look.
They'd last forever.

724
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,036
- (Rose) I'd like a pair of those.
- Good night, Doctor.

725
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,111
jones.

726
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:56,779
There's been an accident... 48 Cheston Square.
You know, that embassy.

727
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:59,787
Woman killed herself.
Fell down a fiight of stairs.

728
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:03,723
Get an ambulance sent over.
Ask for Mr. Baines.

729
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,920
Is it too hot? Is it?

730
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,297
Here, try it now. Go on.

731
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,461
- Now, Rose, have you got the address?
- Give me time.

732
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:18,029
- Did you say the name was Baines?
- Uh, yes, Baines. 48 Cheston Square.

733
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,843
Baines.

734
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,470
What's the matter?

735
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,481
Do you know him?

736
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,017
I live there.

737
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,485
What made you run away, sonny?

738
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,254
Nothing.

739
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,156
You weren't frightened or anything?

740
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,363
No.

741
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,229
Then everything
was all right at home?

742
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,895
Yes.

743
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,099
Does your father
work at the embassy?

744
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,544
No. He's ambassador.

745
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,113
Oh!

746
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,183
I know your daddy!

747
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,938
Oh, there you are, Phile.

748
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,941
We picked him up in Hilton Street.

749
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:28,943
There's been an accident?

750
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,945
Yes.

751
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:34,016
- Over there?
- The doctor's with her now.

752
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,745
Now...

753
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,822
just...

754
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:42,289
just... just sit down there...

755
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,360
for a moment, Phile.

756
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:49,831
- How did it happen?
- We'd had a few words up there.

757
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,334
She was angry with the boy
for some reason.

758
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,734
The next thing I knew...

759
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,966
she'd slipped going down the stairs.

760
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,135
- Can I help at all, sir?
- No. Just an accident.

761
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:10,812
I'll be off. There's nothing more that I can do.
You better tell the ambassador at once.

762
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,822
He's away.
I've phoned the frst secretary.

763
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,324
Don't worry, man.
More than you can help.

764
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:20,328
You did all that you could.
These things happen, you know.

765
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,830
- I can't believe that she's...
- I know.

766
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:26,333
The ambulance will be coming.
I'll sign the certifcate frst thing in the morning.

767
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,428
- Let me see. Where did I leave my coat?
- It's here, I think.

768
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,371
(Doctor) Don't think me heartless.
In my position one must try to be hard.

769
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,740
Death is like a business.

770
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,972
It has to be attended to.

771
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,542
Why, it's Phillipe, isn't it?

772
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,814
What are you doing here?
You ought to be in bed.

773
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,322
We found him wandering around.

774
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:51,325
We were going to send him home
when we heard about the accident.

775
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,895
He said he was sleepwalking.

776
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:56,966
Why, I know Phillipe.
He doesn't walk in his sleep.

777
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,125
Do you, Phillipe?

778
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,238
What's the boy been doing?

779
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,308
(Doctor) Now, listen, Phillipe,
did anything happen to frighten you?

780
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,971
We went to the zoo, that's all.
The boy's tired out.

781
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,049
I'll take him upstairs to bed.

782
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,119
Wait a moment.
Come here, Phillipe.

783
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,151
- Did he see it?
- I don't think so.

784
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,858
Well, you're a fne sort of chap, aren't you,
wandering about at night in your pajamas.

785
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,933
Who do you think you are...
Nick Carter?

786
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,060
Where'd you get this outft?

787
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:38,072
We had to fnd him those
at the station.

788
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,267
Why did you run away, Phillipe?

789
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,276
I've told you...
she went for the boy.

790
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,278
(Doctor)
Tell me everything you know, Phillipe.

791
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,541
Then you won't be frightened anymore.

792
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,742
It's long past bedtime.
We'll go upstairs.

793
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,615
- He needs sleep.
- I'm a doctor, Baines.

794
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,689
Why was she angry with you, Phillipe?

795
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,690
Because of secrets.

796
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,692
Secrets?
Do you know what he means?

797
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,695
You've no business pestering the boy.
He's half asleep.

798
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,765
What were those secrets, Phillipe?

799
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,196
Come on. You can tell me.
Was she angry at the zoo?

800
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:10,568
- No.
- Was everything all right at the zoo?

801
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,073
- Yes.
- Do you know what made her angry?

802
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,542
No.

803
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,113
You're not angry with Baines,
are you?

804
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,375
No. Of course not.

805
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,917
You're not going
to send him to prison.

806
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,614
Doctors don't do that.

807
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,191
I don't mind going to bed now.

808
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,623
You'd better take him up there, Baines.

809
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,923
Give him one of these tablets.

810
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,334
Was it self-defense,
like in Africa?

811
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,012
Dr., um... Dr. What's-his-name
is the police doctor, isn't he? Dr. Wilson?

812
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,016
Good evening, Dr. Fenton.

813
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,518
This is a terrible business.
Is Baines about?

814
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,521
He's upstairs putting the child to bed.
He was found in the street, scared.

815
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,523
What about?

816
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:05,526
I should like the police doctor
called in, if you don't mind.

817
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,960
Police doctor?
What's he got to do with it?

818
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,089
I should like Dr. Wilson called.

819
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:13,191
- Surely there is nothing to worry you, is there?
- (Doctor) Possibly not.

820
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:19,569
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

821
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,701
The ambassador's a great stickler.

822
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,211
He won't like the police
within the embassy.

823
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,476
You do realize that this is
offcially foreign territory.

824
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,677
- Police are not allowed in here without permission.
- The woman's dead.

825
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,449
Yes, but an accident, surely.

826
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:37,959
- Probably.
- Well, wasn't it?

827
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,528
Perhaps.

828
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,824
But I'm not prepared
to sign the death certifcate.

829
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:46,027
Very well. I'll have to phone
the foreign offce in Scotland Yard.

830
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,695
Goodness only knows whether
there'll be anybody there this hour.

831
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:51,296
The Yard doesn't close, sir.

832
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,671
I meant the foreign offce.

833
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,302
It'll make you sleep.

834
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:03,013
You've got to try and put it
right out of your head, Phile...

835
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,349
everything you've seen
and heard tonight.

836
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,917
I understand.

837
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,652
Well, go to sleep...

838
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,662
and forget it.

839
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,434
I'm going to give you
two night-lights tonight.

840
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,766
It'll be daylight before
you can sayJack Robinson.

841
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:25,102
Baines, are you going?

842
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,701
Listen, Phile, you...

843
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:33,837
you remember that telegram
Mrs. Baines sent me?

844
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:38,751
You had it.
You... You made a dart of it.

845
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:42,586
- What did you do with it?
- I threw it away.

846
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,284
Where?

847
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,931
I... I don't remember.

848
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:51,158
Why?

849
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,932
Well, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't like anyone else to fnd it.

850
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:01,133
You see, th-they think Mrs. Baines
was with us at the zoo.

851
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:04,304
It'd look funny,
that telegram coming.

852
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:08,144
And I... I don't want them to know
julie was with us tonight.

853
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:10,219
She wouldn't like it.

854
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,656
There's no need to tell the police
more than they know.

855
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,056
Yes, I understand.

856
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,095
Are you scared?

857
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,597
Scared? No.

858
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,762
Only we've... we've got to be careful
what we say to policemen.

859
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:35,867
Oh, well, no good putting it off, I suppose.
Better go down and talk to them.

860
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,580
Good night, Phile.

861
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:43,982
Baines, you could run away.

862
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,330
I remember.

863
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,904
I remember where I threw it.

864
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,637
Well, then I heard the boy say,
"Was it in self-defense?"

865
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,269
He admits there was a quarrel
at the head of the stairs.

866
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,713
- Is that the staircase?
- Yes.

867
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,717
Are the injuries consistent
with a slip...

868
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,720
Evening, Fenton.
It's an awful hour to be called out.

869
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:23,553
- I'm used to it. It's the hour for babies.
- Is it? Well, what's the trouble?

870
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:26,059
This is Inspector Hart, sir,
of the special branch.

871
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:29,131
- He'll help with any interpreting.
- (Speaking French)

872
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:33,361
I wouldn't mind so much
if the ambassador was here.

873
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:41,474
(Inspector Speaking French)

874
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,477
- You were here at the time?
- No.

875
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:46,480
I was having dinner with some friends
in a restaurant.

876
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,278
All right, all right.
Where is this fellow Baines?

877
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,285
In the basement, I think.

878
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,288
No, he went upstairs
putting the child to bed.

879
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,757
There'd be no objection, I suppose,
to our seeing over the servants' quarters?

880
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,023
No, none at all.
Through the door there.

881
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:04,031
(Speaking French)

882
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,102
You would trouble me much less
if you'd speak English.

883
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:14,870
Of course, the story
of her slipping may be true...

884
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:19,947
but the type of injuries
suggest something more violent.

885
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,847
What if there'd been a push?

886
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,921
- Why do you say that?
- We know that they quarreled.

887
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:30,185
- Up there?
- Mmm.

888
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:33,194
- Is he a big chap?
- You saw him come down just now.

889
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,264
Oh, he.

890
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,582
- Mr. Baines?
- Yes.

891
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:01,088
We've permission
to ask you a few questions.

892
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:04,091
This has been a terrible night for you
and we don't propose to keep you long.

893
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:06,161
I'll tell you anything I know.

894
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:20,432
There was nobody else in the house,
was there, when it happened?

895
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,443
No.

896
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,877
You had supper out in the yard.

897
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,949
The boy wanted a picnic.

898
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:28,607
just the three of you.

899
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,118
just the boy and I.

900
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,120
But there were three places laid.

901
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,753
Oh, yes, of course.

902
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,522
I forgot.
Mrs. Baines was with us.

903
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,790
Try to remember things like that.

904
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:46,425
It helps us, you know,
to get the details right.

905
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,628
I'm sorry.

906
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,865
(Fenton)
Can we have a word with you?

907
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:19,100
(No Audible Dialogue)

908
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:24,204
Good heavens.
What's he doing there?

909
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,378
Now what, boy?

910
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,381
- Come along, Phile.
- It's all right, Baines. I'll take him up.

911
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,883
Hello. What's this
you've got hold of? Hmm?

912
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:40,649
You don't want that now.
I'll take it. Now watch. See?

913
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,697
He's in the same room?

914
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:59,768
Baines.
Is he in the same room?

915
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,400
Uh, y-yes.

916
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,387
Well, what was he up to?

917
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,396
Oh, n-nothing, sir.

918
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,729
Mr. Baines, I understand
there was some sort of scene...

919
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,736
between your wife
and the boy tonight.

920
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,033
Do you know what it was about?

921
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,166
Well, she... sh-sh-she used to
get in a fuss about...

922
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,676
trying to keep the house tidy.

923
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,043
Do you know what he'd been up to?

924
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:42,117
Or was there nothing unusual
to make her angry tonight?

925
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,949
No.

926
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:49,957
You said just now that Mrs. Baines
had had supper with you downstairs.

927
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,395
You did say that, didn't you?

928
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,965
Yes.

929
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,966
Well, then...

930
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:06,132
(Stammering)
I... I... forgot.

931
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,142
She wasn't with us.

932
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,610
But there were three places laid.

933
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,977
Who else was there?

934
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:17,519
Nobody.
l-l-I must have laid it from h-habit.

935
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,986
But the third place was used.

936
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,216
How do you account for that?

937
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:29,095
Well, I think we'll leave all the questions
to Chief Inspector Crowe in the morning...

938
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,098
after he's read the doctor's report.

939
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,668
Doctor's report?

940
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:38,206
It's only that your story of the slip
doesn't quite ft in with what they say.

941
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,392
julie!

942
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:06,662
- Why not tell them everything?
- No, no. Leave it to me.

943
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:09,670
There's no need for you
to be brought into this.

944
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:12,138
- You go to the offce.
- (Lock Clicks)

945
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,107
- Good morning, Baines.
- Good morning, sir.

946
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,114
- Are they here yet?
- Not yet, sir.

947
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,411
Who is this lady?

948
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,919
She... She works here, sir,
in the typing room.

949
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,251
- A bit early, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

950
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,985
I had something to do
that I didn't fnish on Saturday.

951
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,323
Oh, I see.

952
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,296
Do you do shorthand?

953
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,425
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Don't go for a moment.

954
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:44,767
Chief Inspector Crowe, sir.

955
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:47,774
I'm the frst secretary. I'm in charge here
until the ambassador returns.

956
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,777
Yes, I know. We shall try to cause you
as little trouble as possible.

957
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,779
I see.
This is Mr. Baines.

958
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,509
Oh.
My sympathy, Mr. Baines.

959
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,520
- My ambassador will expect a full report.
- Yes, naturally.

960
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:03,023
Have you any objection to
one of our typists taking down what's said?

961
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,025
No, none whatever.

962
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:08,028
Actually, I've no right to object.
We're on foreign territory here.

963
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,530
Oh, could I see
the little boy, Phillipe.

964
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,692
- If you think it's necessary...
- Yes. Thank you.

965
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:15,861
(First Secretary)
Oh, Baines, uh, would you? Better fetch him.

966
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,374
- (First Secretary) Have you got a notebook?
- (Julie) I'll get one, sir.

967
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,481
There.

968
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,487
What shall I say, Baines?

969
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:38,117
Tell them anything they want to know,
except for you-know-who.

970
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,491
Was it like this
that time in Africa?

971
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,996
- What time?
- The time you killed a man.

972
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:44,998
Not a bit like this.

973
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,625
Don't worry, Baines.
I won't tell them anything.

974
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:58,478
Would you mind, Baines,
putting a notice on the front door...

975
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:01,606
telling the clerks to use the empty offce
next to the visa section next door.

976
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,948
- Hello, sonny. Don't run away.
- I wasn't running away.

977
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,955
No, I mean, I just wanted
to say, "How do you do?"

978
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,855
- Your name is Phillipe, isn't it?
- Yes.

979
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:13,086
I've heard quite a lot about you.

980
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:16,096
- You're the little boy who ran away.
- I didn't run away.

981
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,428
I've said that again, have I?

982
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,002
I meant, you're the one
who took a walk.

983
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:25,403
And a rather late walk, wasn't it?
After supper, hmm?

984
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,943
Oh, quite a party you had last night,
didn't you? A picnic party.

985
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:30,944
No.

986
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,879
- Didn't you have it downstairs with...
- No!

987
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,609
Do you want me
to take all this down?

988
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:39,381
No, no, no.
This is just friendly conversation.

989
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:42,321
We are friends, aren't we?

990
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,392
- Hmm?
- No.

991
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:49,864
Well, anyway, you didn't have
a picnic downstairs last night with anybody.

992
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:52,729
No!

993
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,803
I've put up the notice.

994
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,666
No!

995
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:02,408
I'd like to have a word
with Mr. Baines.

996
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,412
- Where could we be quiet?
- Uh, here in the ambassador's room.

997
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:08,074
I'd like you and your secretary
to be present.

998
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,583
I just want to get
Mr. Baines's story quite straight.

999
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,586
- My story's straight enough.
- Yes, yes, of course.

1000
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,657
I just want to iron out
one or two inconsistencies.

1001
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:20,494
Oh, would you wait outside
for a few moments, sonny?

1002
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,030
I just want to have
a little talk with Mr. Baines.

1003
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,896
- Have you got a ball to play with?
- No.

1004
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,969
Well... Oh. Mm-hmm.

1005
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:33,003
Uh, Ames, let him borrow
your chiming watch.

1006
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,242
It's like this, see.

1007
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,806
- (Chiming)
- Do be careful with it now.

1008
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:50,420
Tsk.
Poor Mrs. Baines.

1009
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:53,586
Down these very stairs.
I can almost see her. Can't you?

1010
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,926
Yes. I expect her neck
was snapped like a matchstick.

1011
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,932
- Mmm.
- Do you see any blood?

1012
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:02,094
There wouldn't be any blood
if her neck was broken, would there?

1013
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,570
Might be a little
if the bone came through.

1014
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:07,801
Treacherous stuff, this marble.
I wouldn't have it in my house at any price.

1015
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,910
You listen to the watch, sonny.

1016
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,746
I wonder if you could fnd
something to do somewhere else, hmm?

1017
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,827
Crowe says, will you photograph the position
of the body from the top of the stairs.

1018
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,556
Right.

1019
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,461
No, not that way, sonny.

1020
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,663
Like this. See?

1021
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:40,139
(Chiming)

1022
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,845
- What are you doing?
- Hmm?

1023
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:47,848
Oh, yes. See this powder?

1024
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:51,716
Well, that's solved more crimes
than the whole police force put together.

1025
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,221
Here, put your thumb just down there.
just press it down quite like that. That's it.

1026
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,224
Now put some powder on.

1027
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,294
Now you blow and watch.

1028
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:07,368
See? There's only one person in the world
that has a thumb like that.

1029
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,767
And that's how we fnd things out.

1030
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:15,804
Yes, they, uh...

1031
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,812
they want to have
a word with you, Phile.

1032
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:22,281
Oh, well, we shan't need you
for a few moments, Baines.

1033
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,818
Well, I'll be downstairs.

1034
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:33,960
Well, Phillipe, I don't suppose
you ever met a detective before.

1035
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,030
Except in books.

1036
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,957
Did the watch work?

1037
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,161
Not taken out the works yet?

1038
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:46,002
You know, Phillipe,
I've got a boy at home very like you.

1039
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:48,474
He's a bit older, that's all.

1040
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,478
Oh, he likes marbles.
Do you like marbles?

1041
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,946
Look here.
What do you think of that one?

1042
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,517
I think that's a champion.
Don't you?

1043
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,086
I always win with it anyway.

1044
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:03,224
I don't suppose Mrs. Baines
would have liked marbles, would she?

1045
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:08,930
But I expect Baines could
throw a marble with the best of us.

1046
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,022
I like Baines.
Don't you?

1047
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:12,862
Yes.

1048
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,334
But not Mrs. Baines?

1049
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,997
She killed Macgregor.

1050
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:20,768
Killed Macgregor?
Who was he?

1051
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,174
- My snake.
- Oh.

1052
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:25,246
You can keep that marble if you'd like.

1053
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:30,375
Baines had a quarrel with Mrs. Baines
about you last night, didn't he?

1054
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:35,622
No!

1055
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,817
Didn't you hear them quarreling?

1056
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,518
No!

1057
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:43,120
- Phillipe, why did you run away?
- I took a walk.

1058
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:46,928
Oh, a bit late, wasn't it, for a walk?
In your pajamas?

1059
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:49,697
Now, wasn't it because Mrs. Baines
frightened you?

1060
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:51,932
No.

1061
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,634
But she did hit you, didn't she?

1062
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,643
No.

1063
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:59,805
- She came to your room last night.
- No.

1064
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:04,045
Phillipe, tell me, what did you see
that made you run away?

1065
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:06,052
I didn't run away.

1066
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:09,681
Mrs. Baines was away all day
yesterday, wasn't she?

1067
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:14,091
- What did you do?
- I went to the zoo with Baines and...

1068
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,925
"And"?

1069
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,994
Phillipe. And?

1070
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:23,765
And then we went to the reptile house,
and then we came home.

1071
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,965
- And then?
- We had supper.

1072
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,599
- "We"?
- Baines.

1073
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,974
- L, Baines and...
- Yes? And?

1074
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:34,014
And then we...
And then we played games.

1075
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,517
- What sort of games, Phillipe?
- Hide-and-seek in the dark.

1076
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:40,247
I always get a bit frightened
when I play that. Who hid?

1077
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:42,255
I hid, and they couldn't fnd me.

1078
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:45,190
- "They"?
- Baines, I mean! Baines, I mean!

1079
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,693
"They," Phillipe?
Now, who was with Baines?

1080
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:50,162
- Nobody! Nobody!
- Phillipe.

1081
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:53,132
- Who did you play hide-and-seek with?
- Baines! Just Baines!

1082
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,534
(Speaking French)

1083
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,304
(Speaking French)

1084
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,673
(French)

1085
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,678
You must tell the truth.

1086
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,681
- (French)
- What is this? What are they saying?

1087
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:10,684
- It's a bit fast, sir. I can't quite follow.
- Will you speak English, please.

1088
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,310
(Baines)
Don't badger them.!

1089
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:15,652
I'm here, aren't l,
if you want to ask any questions.

1090
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:19,158
Now, Phillipe, tell me...

1091
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,661
who was with Baines?

1092
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,996
His niece.

1093
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,160
- (Crowe) Was she your niece, Mr. Baines?
- I told him so.

1094
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,699
Your girl?

1095
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,673
Yes. It was me.

1096
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:40,043
- You were here?
- Yes. He wanted to keep me out of it.

1097
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:43,174
He d... He di...
didn't mean any harm.

1098
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:46,186
And this telegram?

1099
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:49,519
She tried to catch us out, I suppose.

1100
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,524
You'd better go upstairs, Phillipe.

1101
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:54,094
You can keep the marble if you like.

1102
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:58,398
- Baines.
- No, no. Mr. Baines is staying here.

1103
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,695
(Marble Clatters On Stairs)

1104
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,702
Now we're getting somewhere.

1105
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:07,138
Your quarrel with Mrs. Baines last night
was over this young lady.

1106
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:11,201
It was what I said.
She went for the boy. She was hitting him.

1107
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,372
That's not what the boy says.

1108
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,382
Can't you see that child is lying?

1109
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,611
I'm afraid there have been
a lot of lies in this business.

1110
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:21,553
- There was no need for them.
- I sincerely hope there wasn't.

1111
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:26,616
Now, will you come upstairs
and tell me exactly what happened.

1112
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:32,094
I was in this room... with Julie.

1113
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,100
Mm-hmm? Yes?

1114
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:36,762
I thought I heard the boy calling.

1115
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,238
I came out here...

1116
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:43,809
and then I saw her hit him,
as I told you.

1117
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:47,143
- (Crowe) Go on.
- She came running down these stairs.

1118
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,878
She wanted to get into that room,
toJulie.

1119
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,689
I caught hold of her.

1120
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,291
She pushed me back.

1121
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:00,361
She was hysterical.

1122
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:05,024
She used to get into these rages
and do anything.

1123
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:09,467
I've known her to put her hand
through a window she couldn't open.

1124
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,971
I wasn't going to let her get in there.

1125
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,564
Yes? And then?

1126
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:17,372
And then I pushed her back...

1127
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:20,413
over there.

1128
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,779
She was shouting all the time.

1129
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,146
I don't remember exactly what.

1130
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:31,025
And we... we were struggling...

1131
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:33,026
here.

1132
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,028
(Crowe)
Yes.

1133
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,792
"Stop it," I said. "Stop it.

1134
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:40,959
Go downstairs, and presently
I'll come down and talk to you."

1135
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,470
Then she seemed calmer
and started down the stairs.

1136
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,871
I went back to this room.

1137
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:51,844
- What is it, Harry?
- They're on the telephone from Selfridges.

1138
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:55,940
They want to know if it'd be all right if they deliver
the 40 gilt chairs tomorrow afternoon...

1139
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,951
instead of today...

1140
01:20:58,053 --> 01:20:59,953
as the reception
is not till Wednesday night.

1141
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:03,456
Yes, yes, tomorrow will be all right.

1142
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:07,050
Then I...
I went back to this door.

1143
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:14,764
No, Harry... Harry, tell them they must
deliver the chairs today because we...

1144
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:19,398
just tell them they must
deliver the chairs as arranged.

1145
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:25,840
Then I...
I went back to the door.

1146
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,511
When I got there,
I heard the scream...

1147
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,688
as I told you.

1148
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:37,053
I came out...

1149
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:39,285
and when I got here...

1150
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:42,488
I saw her hit the last step.

1151
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:46,499
We've examined this staircase
very carefully, Mr. Baines...

1152
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:49,502
and there's no evidence
of her having slipped.

1153
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:52,505
When people slip,
they try to recover.

1154
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:56,737
They leave some sign...
a scratch on the banister, anything.

1155
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:59,177
It's just like a car skidding.

1156
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:01,681
- What, and there's nothing?
- (Crowe) Nothing.

1157
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:05,719
And the injuries would indicate
something more than a slip.

1158
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,789
You're quite sure
you didn't, uh, push her?

1159
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:11,290
You were both, I take it, very angry.

1160
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:14,362
I'd done enough to her without that.

1161
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:17,056
You see,
if she'd slipped from here...

1162
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,065
or even a few steps down...

1163
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,965
she couldn't possibly have landed
where she did...

1164
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,163
because we've tested that...

1165
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:27,241
unless she was pushed.

1166
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:32,803
You're a very strong man, Mr. Baines.
You probably don't know your own strength.

1167
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:35,144
I didn't push her.

1168
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:40,714
Why did the boy ask you,
"Was it self-defense...

1169
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:43,154
as in Africa?"

1170
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:46,159
I've never been out of the country.

1171
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:49,890
- Never?
- Well, except once, to Ostend.

1172
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:54,298
Very well, Mr. Baines. Would you come
into the other room? And you too, miss.

1173
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:01,507
- And whose room is this?
- A guest room.

1174
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:05,511
Where were you when it happened,
when the scream came, hmm?

1175
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,581
Yes?

1176
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,850
There.

1177
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:15,286
Although there had been a struggle outside
and angry words, according to Mr. Baines?

1178
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,525
I couldn't do anything else.

1179
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:23,256
I should have thought
you'd have got up and tried to hide.

1180
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,265
I couldn't.

1181
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:28,268
I'm sorry to have to ask you
all these questions.

1182
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:32,067
- You then dressed in a great hurry, I suppose.
- Of course.

1183
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,073
That would be after the scream.

1184
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:36,075
Yes.

1185
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:39,578
How long was that
after the child called out?

1186
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,911
I don't know.

1187
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,418
Two, three minutes.
I don't know.

1188
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,819
- The child said he never called out.
- He must be lying.

1189
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:52,450
It's obvious somebody must be lying.

1190
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,825
When you dressed,
what did you do?

1191
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:57,830
He showed me out.

1192
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:01,732
Wouldn't it have been wiser,
and more honest, to have stayed?

1193
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:06,739
He wanted to keep me out of it.
I was frightened because of our lies.

1194
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:08,468
I don't understand you.

1195
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:13,339
Then I... I can't explain to you.

1196
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,348
How long had you known Mr. Baines?

1197
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:19,011
Ever since I started to work
at the embassy... seven months.

1198
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,816
- Without Mrs. Baines's knowledge?
- Yes.

1199
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:25,188
And all that time you were
carrying on an affair with each other.

1200
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:41,299
- We are very busy here.
- Won't be a moment.

1201
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,877
Look, can't you come back later?

1202
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:47,470
The frst Monday of every month...

1203
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,483
this clock has to be done.

1204
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:55,545
They behave much better if they're, uh...
if they're looked after.

1205
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:58,057
(First Secretary)
Oh, be as quick as you can.

1206
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,525
(Man)
You don't want to do itjerkily...

1207
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:02,926
and not too fast.

1208
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:06,265
You must take your time.

1209
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,835
(Clock Ticking)

1210
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,171
Thank you.

1211
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:21,607
Did you ever discuss marriage?

1212
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:24,917
No.

1213
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:29,080
But your relations with this man
were intimate.

1214
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:33,557
- We love each other.
- And intimacy took place during that period?

1215
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:37,460
We don't talk the same language.
I don't know what you mean.

1216
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:40,830
- I mean, in plain language...
- Oh, leave her alone, can't you?

1217
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:43,267
Don't worry.
It's his duty to ask questions.

1218
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:46,272
Last night was the frst time
we were ever alone like this.

1219
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:50,174
Now, you take your photographs
and fngerprints and everything.

1220
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,906
It's love you'll photograph,
not "intimacy."

1221
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:55,141
What do you want, sonny?

1222
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,583
You've got to leave Baines alone.
He didn't do it.

1223
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,986
- Didn't do what?
- He didn't murder her!

1224
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:10,158
Why did you say "murder," Phillipe?

1225
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:12,165
No one has mentioned murder.

1226
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:14,497
Thank heaven someone has then.

1227
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,502
Why did you say "murder," Phillipe?

1228
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,572
He didn't do it.

1229
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,335
Well, if he didn't do it...

1230
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,343
who did?

1231
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:26,345
Hmm?

1232
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:29,905
I did. My thumbmark's
downstairs on the banister.

1233
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:35,854
Will somebody take this child away?

1234
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,948
Come on.

1235
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:41,153
- I'll take him upstairs.
- No, Mr. Baines, it might be better
if you kept away from the boy.

1236
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,230
What, are you charging me?

1237
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:45,731
I would advise you
to reconsider your story.

1238
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,495
You've already admitted that you were
both quarreling at the top of the stairs.

1239
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:51,333
Perhaps there was a push
that you didn't intend.

1240
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,839
Only please don't ask us
to believe too much.

1241
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:56,672
- I tell you, I don't know how she fell!
- He's quite right, Baines.

1242
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:59,178
- Think carefully.
- I don't have to think! It's the truth!

1243
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,714
Run along, sonny.

1244
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:04,216
- I'll take him up.
- I don't think you'd better, miss.

1245
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,220
There's questions to be asked, and the less
either of you see the boy the better.

1246
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:10,223
- Are you forbidding me?
- No, I'm advising you. That's all.

1247
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:13,488
- In your interest and Mr. Baines's.
- Well, I know his interests better than you do.

1248
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:15,654
As you please, miss.

1249
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:19,358
- Would you care to sit down, Mr. Baines?
- I'm all right.

1250
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:23,730
Listen, you've got to stop telling these lies.
It's only silly. It makes things much worse.

1251
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:27,263
It doesn't. We've got to think of lies
and tell them all the time.

1252
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,969
Then they won't fnd out the truth.

1253
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,012
But Baines didn't do it, Phillipe!

1254
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:35,014
She hit me.
Baines doesn't let people hit me.

1255
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:38,210
Of course he doesn't.
But he'd never kill anyone. You must know that.

1256
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:42,517
- Why, he did in Africa.
- Oh, that's one of his stories.
He's never been to Africa.

1257
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:45,149
Baines doesn't tell me lies.

1258
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,161
- He's got a gun too.
- (Sighs)

1259
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,823
You can't have understood, Phillipe.

1260
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:54,265
The truth can't harm Baines.
Don't you realize he's innocent?

1261
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:58,734
- Oh, if there could only have been a witness.
- What's a witness?

1262
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,104
Someone who saw.

1263
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:04,542
Couldn't I say
that I saw somebody?

1264
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:07,080
Phillipe, now what
have I just told you?

1265
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:09,081
(Conversing, Faint)

1266
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:13,279
Now listen, you promise that from now on
you'll speak only the truth.

1267
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:15,948
- Must I?
- Yes, you must. Now, you promise?

1268
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:19,720
- If you like.
- All right. Now you go and tell them
that you told a lot of lies.

1269
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:22,022
Mr. Baines, it would be
much more satisfactory...

1270
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,065
if you'd consent to come along with us
just to make a formal statement.

1271
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:28,067
And more convenient
for the embassy too, I should think.

1272
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:30,069
Do I have to?

1273
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:33,072
(First Secretary)
You've got to decide it yourself, Baines.

1274
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:35,074
They can't force you to leave here.

1275
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:38,077
They can't arrest you
so long as you are an embassy employee.

1276
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:40,079
Of course,
we could appeal to the ambassador.

1277
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:42,809
- Yes, yes? What is it, Phillipe?
- I've told you lies.

1278
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:46,114
Yes, yes, I know all that.
I'd strongly advise you, Mr. Baines...

1279
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:50,657
- Mrs. Baines did hit me.
- Yes, yes. You shouldn't tell lies.

1280
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:53,124
I only wanted to help Baines.
Please.

1281
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:58,688
I'd strongly advise you, Mr. Baines, to come with us,
or else we shall have to appeal to the ambassador.

1282
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:02,500
I don't want His Excellency troubled.

1283
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:06,664
I'll get my hat.

1284
01:29:06,774 --> 01:29:10,835
That's all right, Mr. Baines.
Perhaps Mr. Hart would get it for you.

1285
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:13,311
I'm not under arrest yet, am I?

1286
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:16,076
I'm going down to my own basement...

1287
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,948
and I haven't invited the police there.

1288
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:27,387
Baines! Oh, Baines!

1289
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,396
Now, now, you, uh...
you mustn't come with me, Phile.

1290
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:33,160
They... They don't want me
to talk to you.

1291
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,667
I haven't done harm, have I?

1292
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:39,672
Trouble is, we...
we've told a lot of lies.

1293
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:43,540
About Africa...
you didn't make it up, did you?

1294
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:46,078
They weren't lies.

1295
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:49,445
Why, that was just a game, Phile.

1296
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,984
I didn't really do those things.

1297
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:54,077
No?

1298
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:57,214
But you did kill Mrs. Baines,
didn't you?

1299
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,128
Yes?

1300
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:04,888
- Didn't you?
- No.

1301
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,560
Oh.

1302
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:13,231
But you did want to be free,
didn't you?

1303
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:16,572
There are faults on both sides, Phile.

1304
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:20,078
We don't have any call to judge.

1305
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:23,378
Perhaps she was what she was because...

1306
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:26,146
I am what I am.

1307
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,984
We ought to be very careful, Phile...

1308
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,217
'cause we make one another.

1309
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:33,623
I thought God made us.

1310
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:35,628
(Phillipe Sobbing)

1311
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:38,460
Trouble is,
we take a hand in the game.

1312
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:42,196
I hope your mother comes back soon.

1313
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:44,430
(Sobbing Continues)

1314
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,769
Good-bye, Phile.

1315
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:50,776
Oh, Baines, we must never
tell any more lies.

1316
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:12,631
- Mr. Crowe, sir.
- Yes?

1317
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:15,327
- Will you come over here a minute?
- What is it?

1318
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:17,597
Somebody's been up here.

1319
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:23,735
Oh, sir, that was me.
Sir! Sir!

1320
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,473
Please.
I want to tell you something.

1321
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:29,277
(Whimpering)
I want to tell you something.

1322
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:30,975
It's very important.

1323
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:34,316
Yes, it's a woman's heel mark, all right.

1324
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:36,913
- Please, sir. Please.
- Run along.

1325
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:39,925
- You can see how it happened.
- Oh, please. It'll only take a minute.

1326
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:43,053
- She wanted to see into the bedroom...
- Please, sir. Please.

1327
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:46,691
- Maybe force her way in.
- Will you listen to me, please?

1328
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:50,328
She came along here
and upset the fiowerpot.

1329
01:31:50,438 --> 01:31:53,669
Please, sir.!
It's about the flowerpot.

1330
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:57,266
- Could she have got
into the bedroom from there?
- Ah, yes, sir, easily.

1331
01:31:57,378 --> 01:32:00,779
- I must tell you. Will you listen to me?
- Come along. We don't want another accident.

1332
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:02,645
(Phillipe)
You must listen to me.

1333
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:05,981
How much easier it would be if everybody
told the police the truth in the frst place.

1334
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,180
It's very important! Please!

1335
01:32:08,289 --> 01:32:11,486
- Would you call Mr. Baines.
- I'll get him.

1336
01:32:11,592 --> 01:32:14,891
- The fiowerpot, Julie, was there when...
- It's all right. They know what happened.

1337
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:17,965
- She upset it before she fell.
- But it was me. I upset it.

1338
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:22,825
Now, will somebody
please listen to me!

1339
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:25,838
You don't need your hat.

1340
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,840
They know what happened.

1341
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:29,910
It's all right.
Come on upstairs.

1342
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:32,445
You must listen.
It will make everything all right.

1343
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,447
- Now, sonny...
- It's the truth.

1344
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:37,677
- I'd like to call your ambassador on his return
just to explain our action.
- Oh, please. Oh, please.

1345
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:40,845
Oh, Mr. Baines,
we shan't require you after all.

1346
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,890
We found some evidence up there
which makes sense of your story.

1347
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:47,553
Yes, she... she's told me.

1348
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:50,324
Now we know how it happened,
what you've said is quite clear.

1349
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:53,730
- Please, I've got to tell you something.
- Will you send this young shaver about his business?

1350
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:55,734
- Come along, Phile.
- I've got to tell him.

1351
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:58,430
Sit down over there, Phile.
We'll attend to you presently.

1352
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,439
Come on. Come on. Over there.

1353
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,441
- Sir, please! I'm telling the truth!
- Sit down.

1354
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:06,206
- (Mutters) Your father always goes away
at the worst possible moment.
- It's the truth this time.

1355
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:09,442
- Where did we leave the hats?
- I'll go and get them, sir.

1356
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,575
- (Speaking French)
- (Speaking French)

1357
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:14,655
(French Continues)

1358
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:20,226
Your evidence will be needed
at the inquest, Mr. Baines.

1359
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:24,594
- (Phillipe Continues Speaking French)
- Of course, we must keep the boy out of it.

1360
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,667
(French)

1361
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:32,070
- Oui.

(Knocking)

1363
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:37,076
I'm afraid, sir,
we've caused you some trouble.

1364
01:33:37,178 --> 01:33:39,203
That's all right.
If only...

1365
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:41,281
Oh, well.
That doesn't matter.

1366
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:44,917
Oh, please. Please.

It's the truth. Please.

Oh, please, do listen to me.
Please.

It's very important
what I want to tell you.

Well, what is it?

- What do you want to say?

01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:05,806
It wasn't Mrs. Baines that upset the fiowerpot.
It was me. You see?

1373
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:08,374
It's my fault.
I did it.

1374
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:13,771
- I've told fbs in my time too.
- Cross my heart!

1375
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:16,441
Shall I tell you a secret?

1376
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,450
No!

1377
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:34,766
Nice weekend, Mr. Baines?
