1
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:13,478
Come on, Cameron.

2
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:39,981
- Is it Dad?
- No.

3
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:44,385
Come on. Let's cook.

4
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,988
What are we eating?

5
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,513
Spaghetti?

6
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,448
Or...

7
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,395
spaghetti?

8
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:57,954
Come on. Help me make the sauce.

9
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:28,184
<i>Lindsey, what are you doing?
Answer the phone.</i>

10
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:31,354
<i>You can't ignore me, alright?
He's my kid too. I have...</i>

11
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:34,674
<i>Alright, look. I'm sorry, okay? Just...</i>

12
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,983
<i>just let me talk to him.</i>

13
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:39,917
<i>I didn't mean to hit him, okay?
It was an accident, alright?</i>

14
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:43,094
I would never intentionally
hurt him like that. You know that.

15
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:47,181
<i>Okay? And I've apologized.
What the hell do you want from me?</i>

16
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,047
Honey?

17
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,782
- Everything okay in there?
- One second, Mom.

18
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,331
You okay?

19
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,870
Mom?

20
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,816
Mom!

21
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,881
What? What?

22
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:46,462
No!

23
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:56,632
Cameron?

24
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:41,471
Oh. Could be important.

25
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,707
- More important than right now?
- No.

26
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,846
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

27
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:52,458
You could have answered your damn phone.

28
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,784
It's time to go, Henry.

29
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,787
- How do you know my name?
- You want me to call security?

30
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:01,358
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who are you? What's this about?

31
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:04,479
Look at your watch. What's it say?

32
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:08,865
- 1:46.
- It's been 1:46 since you came in here.

33
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,833
My watch froze. So what?

34
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:14,537
I guarantee you every watch and clock
in this place says the exact same thing.

35
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:19,637
Alright, crazy guy. Security!
Time for you to go.

36
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,257
You know what this is?

37
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:29,287
It's something important to you.
It's to help you remember who you really are.

38
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,623
My brother gave me this
when I became partner.

39
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,159
That's right. You're a lawyer, Henry.
You work all the time.

40
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,061
You have no social life. You don't go out.

41
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:42,610
And to be painfully honest, women
don't even look in your general direction.

42
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:47,303
We're not in a nightclub.
You're not surrounded by beautiful women.

43
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,538
Wake up, buddy.

44
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,852
We're in your head.

45
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:55,856
It's time for you to go.

46
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,714
That's rude.

47
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,379
Whoa!

48
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,528
You gave them the power, Henry.
You can take it back.

49
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:14,223
He's just messing with you, babe.

50
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,491
That all you got?

51
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:20,537
- Looking for Maggie?
- Where is she?

52
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:23,740
She says she's so very sorry
about your little boy.

53
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,209
- Fuck you!
- Get him out of here.

54
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,646
- Better luck next time.
- Look out the window, Henry.

55
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,521
Something wrong, Henry?

56
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,286
- Come on.
- Oh...

57
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:52,312
- Don't look at them. Keep moving.
- I'm losing my mind. Losing my mind.

58
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:03,914
- Shit.
- What? What?

59
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:07,250
Come on, did you really think I was
gonna make it that easy for you?

60
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,252
- What's your favorite color?
- I don't have a favorite.

61
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:12,013
What color's your car? Your best suit?
Favorite sweater? Come on!

62
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,873
- What?
- I need to make an escape route,

63
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,226
- something true. Answer the question.
- Green.

64
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,741
- Where the fuck did that come from?
- Come on!

65
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:26,236
- What the hell is this?
- This is where we break down the illusion.

66
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,817
If you want to wake up from this, jump.

67
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,079
- Henry, open the door!
- Fuck that.

68
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,666
Open the door! Henry, let me in!

69
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,285
But, baby... But your eyes are black.

70
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,521
Baby, he slipped something into your drink.

71
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:48,457
Henry! Jump, now.
You won't get another chance.

72
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,494
- You can't make me do this.
- I can't make you do anything, Henry.

73
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:54,497
- You have to believe it will work.
- Open the door! Let me in!

74
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,233
Come on. Open the door! Let me in!

75
00:09:57,313 --> 00:10:00,069
- You go first.
- If that would help, I would.

76
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,538
But you have to make the choice.

77
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,453
Come with me, Henry.

78
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,867
No!

79
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,716
No!

80
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:28,958
Alright. Rise and shine, boss.

81
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:32,195
You did it. Another one bites the dust, huh?

82
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,898
Welcome back to reality.
How many fingers am I holding up?

83
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:39,835
Oliver, get your damn thumb out of my face.

84
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:42,116
Alright. You'll live.

85
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,809
Maggie wasn't there.

86
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,846
After 15 dives, we've lost her.

87
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,449
I know. But we'll get her.
She can't hide forever.

88
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,930
She's taunting me, Oliver.

89
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,566
It's a game to her.

90
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,428
You.

91
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,242
You were in my dream.

92
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,294
Wasn't a fucking dream.

93
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,196
This is gonna be the end of you.
You know that, right?

94
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,647
- We'll lower the dosage next time.
- Can't lower the dosage.

95
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:12,127
The problem is you, boss.

96
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:15,632
Come on. Look what the bouncer
did to your wrist.

97
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,701
Look, you're adapting.
It's becoming too real.

98
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:22,606
I'm telling you, if you don't watch it,
you're gonna get stuck in there.

99
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:26,532
You're not going soft on me, are you, Oliver?

100
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:32,883
I'm just saying... I don't know.
Take a month or two off.

101
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:35,994
Let your body recover, you know?

102
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,800
Maggie wasn't there.

103
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:45,127
Why wasn't she there?

104
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:54,304
Hey, I dug up all the places
our guy visited before the possession.

105
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:58,875
Aside from his office, he hung out
at Starbucks and low-rent strip clubs.

106
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,343
Okay. Let's check it out.

107
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,747
I'm gonna need surveillance tape
on the nights Henry visited.

108
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:07,817
I want to see who he's
hanging out with at those strip clubs.

109
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,052
I think I just heard Oliver volunteer.

110
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:15,791
Oh! You cannot pay me enough money. No.
Besides, I have a date with reality tonight.

111
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:18,227
Well, that sounds intriguing.

112
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:21,380
- What's her name?
- Sara.

113
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,530
- Wait a minute.
- What happened to Jenny?

114
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,204
Jenny? Jenny wanted to go skydiving, so...

115
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:32,041
You broke up with her
because she wanted to go skydiving?

116
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,777
Yeah. You know how I feel about high places.

117
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:38,147
- Hm.
- Oliver, have I taught you nothing?

118
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,918
Oh, my God. I almost forgot. There's someone
named Camilla that's here to see you.

119
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:45,831
She said she's from the Andrade Archdiocese.

120
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,369
The Vatican?

121
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,817
- Whoa. She's hot.
- Ugh!

122
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:12,090
So should I tell her to go away?

123
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:18,053
Tell her she's got five minutes.

124
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,356
<i>I've been following your work
for quite some time.</i>

125
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:23,659
I understand you've done
three exorcisms in the last six months.

126
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,266
I prefer to call them evictions. Yes.

127
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,735
- Why are you here?
- My superiors need an incarnate.

128
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,405
What happened to Felix Nazra?

129
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,942
They thought perhaps the student
has surpassed the teacher.

130
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,279
Or they just got sick
of the body counts you leave behind.

131
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,492
This situation needs a scalpel, not a hammer.

132
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,731
Please.

133
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,843
Camilla, right?

134
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:16,879
You're wasting your time.
It's not gonna happen.

135
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,548
I don't clock in for the Vatican.

136
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:24,087
- What do you have against the Church?
- How much time you got?

137
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,824
Look, I just don't believe what I do
belongs to any one religion.

138
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,360
- Exorcising demons?
- No, to you, it's a demon.

139
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,198
To others, it's an unclean spirit, it's jinn,
it's orisha. Take your pick, okay?

140
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,368
Really, it's just a parasitic entity
in a non-corporeal transference.

141
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:45,107
What if I told you a parasitic
entity just took a little boy?

142
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,643
I would say it ain't my problem.

143
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:49,835
What if I told you it was Maggie?

144
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,198
I thought that would get your attention.

145
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,122
Hmm...

146
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,527
Let me guess.

147
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:09,832
She's holed up in a half-dead body in a
whorehouse, just ready to be taken down.

148
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:13,230
You need an incarnate because the ring
of St Vicinius and a piece of holy cloth

149
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,220
- just won't cut it this time.
- I'm sorry.

150
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,174
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then let me make it crystal-clear.

151
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:21,089
The last beautiful woman your superiors
sent here dangled the same carrot,

152
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:25,014
"We're sure it's Maggie."
Well, surprise, it wasn't,

153
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:27,371
just some lesser succubus who...

154
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:30,286
turned a suburban housewife
into a heroin-addicted throat-cutter

155
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,254
who nearly killed me and my assistants.

156
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:36,625
Look, I have no idea
about the last woman they sent.

157
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,987
What I do know is that I have
an archdemon possessing the body

158
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,899
of an innocent 11-year-old boy.

159
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,302
We believe that arch
is that entity you call Maggie.

160
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:50,339
So if you and your assistants
really want to take her out...

161
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,407
give me a call.

162
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:56,989
Just don't wait too long. The boy
won't survive more than three days.

163
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:28,510
- Ember.
- Is it her?

164
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,223
Why don't you come inside?

165
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,035
So this is what Vatican money buys?

166
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,096
Can I offer you anything?

167
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:50,966
I just need to know, Felix. Is it Maggie?

168
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,834
Uncertain.

169
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,070
The Church has excluded me from this one.

170
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,841
Why? Because they can't stomach
the murder of a child?

171
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:02,120
Or because they're afraid
they can't cover it up this time?

172
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,249
Ember, remember where you are.

173
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,427
And where's that?

174
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,963
With a friend.

175
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:20,629
Remember the first thing I taught you
about entering other people's minds?

176
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:24,133
Humans are easily blinded
by their needs and desires.

177
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:27,103
It would serve you well to remember that.

178
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:30,606
We each have our methods.
We each have our motives.

179
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:34,377
This conversation wouldn't have lasted
this long if you didn't know it was her.

180
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,255
You know it's her, don't you?

181
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:40,817
Yes.

182
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:44,230
But if you haven't spoken to the Church...

183
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:47,323
how do you know?

184
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,717
I want to show you something.

185
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,438
The door's glass is four inches thick.
A rhino couldn't crack it.

186
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:05,574
There are 12 cameras inside and out,
monitored 24 hours a day.

187
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:08,477
Fantastic. What is it?

188
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:11,956
I've found the light agitates it.

189
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,489
Is that a person? You got somebody
fucking locked up in there?

190
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,692
Remember the incarnate
who disappeared last year?

191
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:25,871
Luka Rejick.

192
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,180
Shit!

193
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,694
This hasn't been Luka Rejick
in a long time, I'm afraid.

194
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:54,223
- What are you doing with him?
- They know a lot about us.

195
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,570
Isn't it time we learned more about them?

196
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:00,760
Jesus!

197
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:04,891
Did you know they've been trying to
infiltrate our ranks for years? He told me.

198
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:10,112
He also told me about the boy,
about Maggie. That's how I know.

199
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:13,175
- What am I waiting for?
- Don't you want to know how to beat her?

200
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:16,221
You know, Ember, sometimes...

201
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:22,618
in order to avoid a fate worse than death,

202
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,187
you must choose death instead.

203
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:29,891
And thanks to Luka here,
I was able to develop this.

204
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:33,862
- What is it?
- C-79.

205
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:37,166
In this vial is a moment of clarity.

206
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,667
What are you talking about?

207
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:42,605
It's a serum made in part
from the blood of our friend here.

208
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,942
Should Maggie get the upper hand,
and I hope she doesn't,

209
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:49,945
this will give you approximately
10 seconds of lucidity

210
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:53,299
in order to do what needs to be done.

211
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,453
Inject this and you'll wake up
with just enough time

212
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:01,190
to end your life
before she traps you forever.

213
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,768
You seriously think I'm gonna use this?

214
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,898
Look, Felix... I appreciate
everything you taught me.

215
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:12,077
But keep your poison.

216
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,447
I'm not planning on dying.

217
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,750
<i>Hello?</i>

218
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,408
Alright, Camilla. Let's talk.

219
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:42,197
The boy's name is Cameron Sparrow.

220
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:46,568
His parents just recently divorced.
The mother is originally from Holland.

221
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:50,149
She has a restraining order
against the father, an alcoholic,

222
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:52,283
he broke the boy's arm.

223
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:56,979
Does Cameron have any history
of schizophrenia, delusion?

224
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,115
- Any meds I should know about?
- No. Nothing in his records.

225
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:03,896
The mother heard him scream in the kitchen.
And when she arrived...

226
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:06,230
she found this.

227
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,026
The boy broke her neck.

228
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:15,331
Of course, we sent in the best exorcists
to handle the situation, but...

229
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,376
they failed.

230
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,205
- How does it transfer?
- Physical contact.

231
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:26,088
Judging from its trail of victims,
it can only possess the weak,

232
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:29,145
kids, the elderly, sick people.

233
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:32,315
I haven't told the mother
about your connection with Maggie.

234
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:36,985
- Is the boy quarantined?
- No one has touched Cameron in a week.

235
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:39,221
- How's the mother's will?
- She's tired.

236
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:43,000
She's been through a lot.
We're keeping her away from the boy.

237
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:49,106
I've already answered
these questions a thousand times.

238
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,134
- Who are you?
- Mrs. Sparrow...

239
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,036
Just Lindsey, no Mrs.

240
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:58,591
- Lindsey, we brought Dr. Ember to help you.
- Another priest. Great.

241
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:02,302
No, he's not a priest. He's like a therapist.

242
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:05,581
I'm not here to treat your son
for mental illness.

243
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,185
- Then why are you here?
- I'm here to evaluate whether or not...

244
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:12,688
Dr. Ember has employed a cutting-edge
method for helping his patients.

245
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:17,026
He can go places we can't, get information
that'd otherwise be unavailable to us.

246
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:20,347
- You're here to perform an exorcism, right?
- Let's get this straight off the bat.

247
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:24,400
I don't do exorcisms. I don't use
religious methods to treat the symptoms.

248
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,664
I go inside the victim's mind
to treat the disease.

249
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:32,908
I don't compel these entities
from the outside. I evict them...

250
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:35,845
- from the inside.
- You evict them?

251
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:41,584
The entity that is holding your son
has no real power. It's a parasite.

252
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:44,220
It feeds off your son's energy.

253
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,656
But in order to do that,
it has to hold him in a dream state.

254
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,983
Even if his eyes are open and he's speaking,
your son is asleep,

255
00:24:51,063 --> 00:24:52,494
the entity is controlling him.

256
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:58,210
In order to keep that control,
it has to convince him his dream is real.

257
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:01,270
It's holding Cameron by...

258
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,906
convincing him he's in another reality?

259
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:05,774
Yes.

260
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:10,112
Through suggestion.
It rifles through his mind

261
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,682
and shows him what he wants most,
but it's all a lie.

262
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:16,427
I tear down the lies.

263
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:22,190
Once Cameron sees the truth,
the entity loses its power.

264
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,626
What happens to the entity?

265
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:28,329
It'll try to jump
into the nearest living host.

266
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:31,876
If it can't find a host, it dies.

267
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:37,049
And you've done this before?

268
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:56,891
<i>Strap her down. Strap her down!</i>

269
00:25:57,571 --> 00:25:59,828
Oh, God.

270
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,032
Okay.

271
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,486
Hello, Father.

272
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:25,521
- The boy hasn't eaten in days.
- Why don't you take a break?

273
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:28,199
You look like you need some rest.

274
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,571
He's okay.

275
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:43,205
It might be best
if you waited in the living room.

276
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:46,775
- But I want to see him.
- I know. I know. But...

277
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:52,089
You have to trust us.
He'll be fine. It's gonna be okay.

278
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,324
This is just an evaluation.

279
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:06,671
If I can't confirm this is Maggie,
I'm outta here.

280
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,240
Hello, Dr. Ember.

281
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:45,776
You know who I am?

282
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,448
How does it feel?

283
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,318
How does what feel?

284
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:00,057
To lose the one you love.

285
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,153
Okay.

286
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:16,474
We've established that you know who I am.

287
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:21,345
Who are you?

288
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,273
I've been known as Ash.

289
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:26,551
Others have called me Plague.

290
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,847
After the Great Deluge,
when the angels took the mortal woman,

291
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,360
I was Desire.

292
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,290
Is this fun for you?

293
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,405
Holy water, crucifixes
and idle threats get so...

294
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,832
dull.

295
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:52,067
What do you want?

296
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,703
You're gonna have to try harder than that.

297
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:57,773
No. I don't have time for this.

298
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,984
Good!

299
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:11,028
Ah.

300
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:14,531
So you do remember.

301
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:21,429
Hey. Hey, hey.

302
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,533
Hey, where are you going? What about the boy?

303
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:27,202
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

304
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:29,113
Wait.

305
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,730
Is it her?

306
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:36,878
- I know what happened to your family.
- Don't you ever mention my family.

307
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:40,415
But if this is an archdemon,
the Church needs to know.

308
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:42,217
A lot of lives could be in jeopardy.

309
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:45,140
Then move out of my way
so I can get my team in here.

310
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,266
Then I'd lock that door, if I were you.

311
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,328
I'm coming for you.

312
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:39,167
The Church is pleased
that you have come to help.

313
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:41,069
Helping? I'm hunting.

314
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:45,740
Excuse me, but is this necessary?
Why can I not be in the same room as my son?

315
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,111
When the shit hits the fan, I'm gonna
need everybody in here out of my hair.

316
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:53,658
- It's safer that way, believe me.
- You should see an image.

317
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,763
Oh, Cameron.

318
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:15,770
What is all this stuff?

319
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,673
Um... this is what we use to monitor
Dr. Ember during dives.

320
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,379
See, each of us is like a wi-fi hot spot,

321
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:27,282
and our brains give off
an invisible field of energy.

322
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,119
You see this cloud right here?
Some people call this an aura or a soul,

323
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,456
but really what it is
is just a cluster of unique ions,

324
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,658
and each of us has our own frequency.

325
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:40,295
So this is Dr. Ember's and this is Cameron's.

326
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,932
You see the black streaks in Cameron's?
That's the parasite.

327
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:47,302
If a victim is weak, it can hook
right into their frequency.

328
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:49,538
Oh, God.

329
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:53,614
So we just use this
to monitor it until we can evict it.

330
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:58,212
What's all that for?

331
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:02,192
Uh, this is gonna lower his heart rate
and EEG to a stasis state,

332
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:06,020
leaving the brain as close to death
as physically possible.

333
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,959
When I hit REM, I'll ride into Cameron's
subconscious, begin dismantling the illusion.

334
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,458
The trick is I only have eight minutes
before my heart gives out,

335
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:16,664
which isn't a lot of time.

336
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,934
Sometimes we get lucky.
It's as easy as the glitch.

337
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:22,937
- The glitch?
- The time glitch.

338
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:26,007
We've discovered that time
is meaningless in the subconscious,

339
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,044
so watches, clocks, anything that tells time,

340
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:32,189
freezes at the time
of the victim's possession.

341
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,021
It'll be okay.

342
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,533
I'm gonna help your son.

343
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:55,770
Okay, boss. You're good to go.

344
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,157
Keep this area clear in case he tries
to jump. You know the drill.

345
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,644
Don't let the boy touch you or anyone else.
Don't let me touch you or anyone else.

346
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:07,148
Oliver, I get anywhere near flatlining,
you yank my ass out with the Narcan.

347
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:09,851
Yeah. I've got the escape hatch
right here, boss.

348
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,196
Only if you absolutely have to.

349
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,431
Dr. Ember.

350
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:19,169
Good luck in there.

351
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,806
Thank you.

352
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,780
Dr. Ember. So nice of you to join us.

353
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:11,388
Starting the clock, boss.

354
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:22,800
Are you ready, Dr. Ember?

355
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:28,139
Then let the games begin.

356
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:05,110
Nice, Cameron. Keep it going.
Fastball next, buddy.

357
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:08,003
Over the plate. Nice!

358
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,438
Nice catch.

359
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,307
Beautiful.

360
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,076
How is he?

361
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,923
Seven minutes to go. So far, so good.

362
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,119
Cameron.

363
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,489
Cameron. Listen, I know you don't know me.

364
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:32,403
But I'm here to help you.
I just want to talk.

365
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,364
What's wrong?

366
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,843
You're... you're bleeding.

367
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:52,413
- What?
- Help! We need help over here.

368
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:54,015
- Oh, no.
- Cameron.

369
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,551
Cameron, come with me, buddy. Come on.

370
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,087
- Wait. Cameron.
- It's okay. You'll be okay.

371
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,789
Sir, I need to lay you down.

372
00:37:04,905 --> 00:37:09,531
No, no, no, no, no. Lie down. Lie down.
You need to lie down. This is serious.

373
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:11,842
No, no. Hold on.

374
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,859
Oh, crap!

375
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,257
- He's gonna flatline.
- Uh, there's a man bleeding.

376
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,060
I'm in the south-east section
of Douglas Park.

377
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,379
Get away from me. This isn't happening.

378
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,219
You have to calm down.
I'm not sure what's wrong.

379
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:50,965
Sir. I think I've found your problem.

380
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,183
I'm sorry, boss.

381
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:05,619
Your EKGs were off the chart,
okay, so we had to pull you out.

382
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,768
- Well, I'm not gonna say I told you so.
- Yeah, well, you just did. Alright, boss.

383
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:23,770
Let's get you to the hospital,
get you checked out, okay?

384
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,408
- I'm fine, Oliver.
- You're fine?

385
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:30,193
What the hell happened in there?

386
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:32,747
It was only a few minutes, Oliver.

387
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:35,116
A couple of minutes?

388
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:38,062
Boss, your heart stopped.

389
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:45,035
Where are you going?

390
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:29,871
Dan used to play in the park
with Cameron, before he lost his job.

391
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,890
The entity is playing into Cameron's desire.

392
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,528
His desire? That man has never said
"I love you" once to that boy.

393
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,997
Cameron doesn't want anything
to do with his father, believe me.

394
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:43,117
Maybe you don't want that, but I'm
telling you, Dan was in the park with him.

395
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:45,587
She's giving him what he wants.

396
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,932
We need to break down her illusion.

397
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,068
It's the only way to free the boy.

398
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:58,338
- Where's his father?
- He's probably getting drunk.

399
00:39:58,418 --> 00:40:01,435
- We need to bring him here.
- That man is not coming anywhere near my son.

400
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,438
- Listen...
- He broke Cameron's arm!

401
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:07,342
This entity is strong. Probably
the strongest I've ever encountered.

402
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:10,245
To get your son back, I'm gonna
need all the ammunition I can get.

403
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:15,049
- No. It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.
- Damn it, listen to me! I am too close.

404
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:17,594
I have come too far.

405
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:22,065
So you either work with me
or you lose your son.

406
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:28,238
Ms. Sparrow, just please tell us
where to find him.

407
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:43,345
There's a bar on 20th and Scarborough.

408
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,390
That's where he usually goes.

409
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:48,993
Thank you.

410
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,513
Hey!

411
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:11,506
I'm in a wheelchair.

412
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:14,475
I can see you're not a fan
of self-preservation.

413
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,246
- Yeah, not much left to preserve.
- Is that self-pity I hear?

414
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:21,949
No. That's freedom, baby. Freedom.

415
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:24,428
Focus on the important shit.

416
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,766
Mmm. Found him.

417
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:33,003
Mr. Sparrow.

418
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,099
Your son's in trouble.
I need you to come with me.

419
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:42,212
- What are you, another lawyer?
- Do I look like a lawyer?

420
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,716
Your son is in trouble.

421
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,145
Yeah, well...

422
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:53,591
I need another beer,
so unless you're buying...

423
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:57,291
You're so funny.

424
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,511
You want me to break your arm, huh?

425
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:11,332
I don't know what they told you,
but I never touched him.

426
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:13,634
I don't give a shit.

427
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:18,239
I said your son's in trouble...
because of you.

428
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,250
Dr. Ember!

429
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:27,057
Ember, stop!

430
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:44,891
- Why didn't you call me?
- You're here, aren't you?

431
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:48,435
Jesus Christ, Lindsey! How long
were you gonna keep this from me?

432
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:51,605
- Why would I tell you anything?
- Because he's my son!

433
00:42:51,685 --> 00:42:54,351
If we're done flirting here?

434
00:42:55,589 --> 00:43:00,422
- Cameron needs us.
- Dan. You need to go with Dr. Ember now.

435
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:05,358
Show me where my son is.

436
00:43:05,438 --> 00:43:07,097
With pleasure.

437
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:16,063
Call him by his name. Remind him
you're in the room. Tell him you love him.

438
00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:19,583
Talk about details that only you
and he would know about.

439
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:23,871
Okay? He'll hear you. He'll wake up.

440
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:27,075
- You sure this is gonna work?
- No. I'm not.

441
00:43:27,155 --> 00:43:32,312
- Then why should I do this?
- I would. If it were my son.

442
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:34,548
Like I said before,
I don't know what they told you, okay,

443
00:43:34,628 --> 00:43:36,984
but I never touched him, okay, ever.

444
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:40,287
- I never touched him.
- Save it for Cameron.

445
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,923
Alright, we have your back,
if something goes wrong,

446
00:43:43,003 --> 00:43:45,526
you get a bad feeling, we'll get you out.

447
00:43:45,606 --> 00:43:48,629
Like what? What's gonna happen?
Like green vomit?

448
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,165
Are you talking about the whole
head-turning thing? Come on!

449
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:52,954
- No matter what, don't touch him.
- Come on.

450
00:43:53,034 --> 00:43:55,503
Dan, I mean it.

451
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:59,073
No physical contact. Do you understand me?

452
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:03,519
Yeah, I won't... I won't touch him.

453
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,525
Let's go.

454
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:27,034
Hey, Cam.

455
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:29,579
It's me. It's Dad.

456
00:44:31,852 --> 00:44:34,349
It's been a while, buddy. I haven't...

457
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:37,286
Haven't seen you, like, forever.

458
00:44:37,566 --> 00:44:41,658
<i>You know, I tried calling a few times.
I guess my messages weren't getting through.</i>

459
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,521
I remember you had that sick curve ball.

460
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:50,206
Just me and you down at the park.

461
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,206
You were good, man.
You should try out for the team.

462
00:44:58,245 --> 00:45:00,167
Cameron.

463
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:02,312
It's Dad.

464
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,794
Slow and easy.

465
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:15,860
It's working. Cameron's surfacing.

466
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:26,369
- Dad?
- Yeah, buddy, it's me. It's Dad.

467
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,417
Cameron, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

468
00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:39,607
You've gotta believe me. It was an accident.

469
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:45,322
If I could take it back, I'd take it back.

470
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:50,184
- What do we got?
- There's a lot of movement.

471
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:53,287
Yeah, it's bouncing around
all over the place.

472
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:57,124
What happened to you, Cameron?
How did this happen?

473
00:45:57,204 --> 00:45:59,293
I forgive you.

474
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:03,364
What? I can't... I can't hear you,
buddy. Say it... say it again.

475
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:07,210
I forgive you, Dad.

476
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:13,206
You do?

477
00:46:13,286 --> 00:46:15,843
Yeah. I want it to be like it was.

478
00:46:16,223 --> 00:46:20,578
- Can it be like before?
- Yeah. It can be like before. Promise.

479
00:46:21,828 --> 00:46:24,795
I'm gonna clean up. Okay?

480
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:28,021
I'll do anything for you.

481
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:30,424
Can we go to the park again?

482
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:33,428
We can go to the park.

483
00:46:33,908 --> 00:46:37,598
We can go to a carnival.
You want to go on the rides?

484
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:41,118
- We can do all that.
- Really?

485
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:44,510
Really. Just as soon as you're better, okay?

486
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,410
I love you, Dad.

487
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:52,588
Cam...

488
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:57,551
- Oh, my God!
- No, stay back! Don't touch him!

489
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:01,311
- Oh, God!
- God is not here.

490
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:09,840
Stop! Don't do this. It's me you want.

491
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,834
Please follow me. Our people are downstairs.

492
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:57,217
Why did you say, "It's me you want"?

493
00:47:59,827 --> 00:48:02,379
There's something you're not telling me.

494
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:06,730
You're not here to help Cameron.

495
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,001
You're here for some other reason.

496
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,772
- Doesn't matter why I'm here.
- Dan is dead!

497
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:20,677
What the hell is going on here?

498
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,448
Talk to me or get the hell out!

499
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:37,427
When I was 26...

500
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:42,599
I discovered that when I was asleep...

501
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:46,457
I could go into the minds of the possessed.

502
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:50,698
When I found out there were others like me...

503
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,911
and how their lives
had been turned upside-down...

504
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:59,515
I kept my abilities hidden.

505
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:03,853
I just wanted a normal life.

506
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,550
And that's what I had.

507
00:50:11,892 --> 00:50:13,623
No.

508
00:50:29,977 --> 00:50:31,675
No.

509
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,451
<i>She was possessed?</i>

510
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,594
Her name was Maggie Grant.

511
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:04,149
She was possessed
by the same entity that's in Cameron.

512
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:07,067
She sensed my ability.

513
00:51:08,347 --> 00:51:10,463
She killed my wife...

514
00:51:10,543 --> 00:51:12,949
and my 11-year-old boy.

515
00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:16,786
After that...

516
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:21,324
there's no turning back.

517
00:51:23,697 --> 00:51:26,653
Since then, I've used every ability I have...

518
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:29,189
to try to find her and kill her.

519
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:31,835
You're not here to help my son.

520
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:35,972
No. I'm not.

521
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:42,659
In all these years,
why hasn't she just killed you?

522
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:51,454
There are fates worse than death.

523
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,971
I was afraid of this.

524
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,744
She's feeding!

525
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:25,864
What's happening?

526
00:52:25,944 --> 00:52:29,082
Maggie's feeding.
She's consuming Cameron's energy.

527
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:31,657
We need to move fast.

528
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:36,323
Boss! Boss!

529
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,930
The kid's got maybe two hours max.
What's the call?

530
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:42,696
Don't let anyone near him.
Do whatever it takes to keep him alive.

531
00:52:42,776 --> 00:52:46,797
- Where are you going?
- To get the edge I need to end this.

532
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,918
Keep it running.

533
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,925
Felix!

534
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,197
Hello? Felix?

535
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,835
Felix?

536
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:16,346
Felix, you here?

537
00:54:21,942 --> 00:54:23,673
Felix!

538
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:27,358
Felix! Felix.

539
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,778
It's Ember.

540
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,807
- What happened?
- I was harvesting more blood.

541
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:36,243
He broke through the straitjacket and bolted.

542
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:40,682
- Where are you hurt?
- It's not my blood. I cut him.

543
00:54:41,852 --> 00:54:44,894
Ember, we gotta get out of here.
I think he's still here.

544
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:48,731
Alright. Let's move.

545
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:36,536
Whoops.

546
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:38,405
Felix...

547
00:55:38,885 --> 00:55:40,683
No.

548
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:43,849
- Stay back.
- Or what?

549
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:12,330
- What are you waiting for?
- Ember, if only you...

550
00:56:24,031 --> 00:56:26,019
Felix? Felix.

551
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:29,027
- Maggie wants you for herself.
- No, Felix.

552
00:56:29,107 --> 00:56:31,059
- She's gonna consume you.
- Felix!

553
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:35,135
- Pray you die so easily.
- Felix! No!

554
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,150
Where have you been?

555
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,887
- I had to get something. How is he?
- He's stable.

556
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:02,522
- He hasn't moved since you left.
- Alright, let's go.

557
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:04,738
Where do you think you're going?

558
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,963
- I'm going back in.
- No, you're not.

559
00:57:10,043 --> 00:57:12,505
I need to talk to you.

560
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:21,499
Look, I don't know where you went,
but you're not gonna go back in,

561
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:23,343
I'm calling in my people.

562
00:57:23,423 --> 00:57:26,179
If you were gonna call in your people
to contain this you'd have done it.

563
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:29,416
What happens when this entity's done
with the kid and decides to jump?

564
00:57:29,496 --> 00:57:31,818
- She's not gonna jump.
- Why not?

565
00:57:31,898 --> 00:57:34,888
Because it's me she wants. I'm sport to her.

566
00:57:34,968 --> 00:57:37,733
Which is why I'm your best shot right now.

567
00:57:40,974 --> 00:57:43,687
I need a physical item of Cameron's.
Something special to him.

568
00:57:43,767 --> 00:57:45,332
Why?

569
00:57:45,412 --> 00:57:49,302
We need to find a truth
that she can't distort...

570
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:52,906
intimate truth that he won't question.

571
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:56,776
It's our only chance
of shattering his illusion,

572
00:57:56,856 --> 00:57:58,871
pulling him out.

573
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,596
This ring, you know where it is?

574
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:13,236
Cameron used to keep this by his bed.

575
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:17,697
And when we left, I took it away.

576
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:21,250
I wanted as few traces
of his father as possible.

577
00:58:21,815 --> 00:58:24,203
I can't think of anything...

578
00:58:24,283 --> 00:58:26,906
Cameron treasured more than this...

579
00:58:26,986 --> 00:58:28,872
stupid ring.

580
00:58:29,522 --> 00:58:32,755
You can tell me to shut up
any time you want, but, uh...

581
00:58:35,228 --> 00:58:37,885
I think Cameron loves his father, but...

582
00:58:38,465 --> 00:58:41,487
I mean, that doesn't mean
he doesn't love you.

583
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:46,959
I mean, Cameron might not know
how to say it, but...

584
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:49,262
I mean, you're his rock.

585
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:52,265
You're his entire world.

586
00:58:52,745 --> 00:58:55,102
He needs you now more than ever.

587
00:58:56,082 --> 00:58:57,847
Lindsey...

588
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,609
I need you...

589
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:04,444
to be strong.

590
00:59:04,524 --> 00:59:08,014
We're getting close.
She shouldn't have killed Dan.

591
00:59:08,494 --> 00:59:12,161
Maggie's getting sloppy
and we will use that against her.

592
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,892
I'm gonna get your son back.

593
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,761
I thought you didn't care.

594
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:23,906
Yeah, well...

595
00:59:26,713 --> 00:59:28,844
I lied.

596
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:00,342
Here.

597
01:00:02,581 --> 01:00:03,971
You sure about this?

598
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:09,176
If I get the boy out and I'm still down,
you get that into my IV.

599
01:00:10,256 --> 01:00:13,079
If it works, it'll buy me just enough time.

600
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:15,582
Enough time for what?

601
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:18,928
Enough time to get the job done.

602
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,930
Whatever you say, boss.

603
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:43,043
- Oliver, you got the Narcan?
- Yeah.

604
01:00:44,123 --> 01:00:46,212
Right here. Ready to go.

605
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:48,323
Let me see it.

606
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,065
Won't be needing this anymore.

607
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:23,867
I hope you said your goodbyes.

608
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:28,622
Because you won't be coming back.

609
01:01:29,402 --> 01:01:31,166
Maybe.

610
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:38,064
But neither will you.

611
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:55,417
Sir?

612
01:01:56,244 --> 01:01:58,012
Sir?

613
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,853
Are you gonna take your ticket or not?

614
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:38,100
Alright. Here we go.

615
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:44,442
Cam, look at that. That looks good, man.

616
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:48,435
Hey, Cameron. How about some cotton candy?

617
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,804
Oh! Jesus, I will never get used to that.

618
01:02:50,884 --> 01:02:52,205
You're telling me.

619
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,029
Cameron!

620
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:11,099
Cameron!

621
01:03:15,874 --> 01:03:17,739
Cameron!

622
01:03:19,946 --> 01:03:23,135
- Dad, it's the guy from the park.
- No worries.

623
01:03:23,515 --> 01:03:25,805
Cameron, I'm here to help you.

624
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,941
Why don't you back off
before someone gets hurt?

625
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:30,576
This is not your father, Cameron.
This is not real.

626
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:33,212
- What are you talking about?
- I know it's confusing.

627
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:35,095
- You're just gonna have to trust me.
- Dad!

628
01:03:35,175 --> 01:03:37,525
Get away from my son.

629
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:42,922
You know what, this is gonna
end badly for you, man.

630
01:03:43,202 --> 01:03:47,184
Cameron, don't be afraid.
Do you remember this ring?

631
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,631
You used to sleep with it, remember?

632
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,268
- Dad?
- It's not your dad, Cameron.

633
01:03:55,348 --> 01:03:58,071
It looks like your dad,
saying everything you want to hear.

634
01:03:58,151 --> 01:04:00,273
- But it's not your father.
- Give me the ring, Cameron.

635
01:04:00,353 --> 01:04:04,677
You know what, you're a frickin' psycho.
You stay away from my son.

636
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:08,147
You know I'd never hurt you, son. Okay?

637
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:10,083
I love you, Cameron.

638
01:04:10,163 --> 01:04:12,125
Cameron?

639
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,954
Your father could never say he loved you.

640
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:17,866
You ever heard him say those words?

641
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,929
Don't listen to him, Cam. Okay?

642
01:04:23,009 --> 01:04:25,832
Hey. I said get out of here.

643
01:04:25,912 --> 01:04:29,944
You know your dad better than anyone.
This is not your dad.

644
01:04:30,024 --> 01:04:32,171
Don't listen to him, Cameron.

645
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:34,750
I'm sorry. Sorry.

646
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:38,210
What's wrong, Cam?

647
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:39,779
Dad?

648
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:42,385
What's wrong, buddy?
Why you looking at me like that?

649
01:04:42,465 --> 01:04:44,383
It's not your dad, Cameron.

650
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:47,575
- This guy's done something to you, Cam.
- Stay away from me.

651
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:50,871
I would never hurt you. Ever.

652
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:53,780
You're not my dad.

653
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,396
Cameron, stop!

654
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,432
He's coming up on four minutes.

655
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,710
Cameron!

656
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,371
- Stay away from me!
- Cameron! Cameron, trust me.

657
01:05:05,451 --> 01:05:07,974
- I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
- What's happening?

658
01:05:08,054 --> 01:05:09,852
Cameron!

659
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:13,722
Come on!

660
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:15,849
Cameron!

661
01:05:19,298 --> 01:05:21,722
Come back, Cameron! Come back!

662
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:24,361
Come on. We gotta keep moving.

663
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:31,998
Don't trust him! He's a bad man!

664
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:34,500
He wants to hurt you.

665
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,837
- Cameron!
- Cameron. Shh! It's okay.

666
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:40,940
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

667
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,161
- This isn't real.
- It feels real.

668
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:46,045
That's because you believe it.

669
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:49,415
Stop believing it
and I promise you it'll go away.

670
01:05:49,495 --> 01:05:51,317
You can make all of this disappear.

671
01:05:51,397 --> 01:05:54,887
I just need you to listen to me
right now. Can you do that?

672
01:05:55,241 --> 01:05:59,167
- O... okay.
- Okay. Do you have a favorite color?

673
01:06:00,506 --> 01:06:03,472
- Blue.
- Oh, that's good. Mine too.

674
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:09,211
You see that blue door?

675
01:06:10,683 --> 01:06:14,907
It's your world, Cameron.
You can control everything in it.

676
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:19,093
It's your way out. Hurry.
Your mom's waiting for you.

677
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:29,197
Go ahead. It's gonna be okay.

678
01:06:34,607 --> 01:06:36,906
Now you're in trouble, Cameron.

679
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:42,637
Go through the door, Cameron, now!
You won't get another chance.

680
01:06:49,188 --> 01:06:52,694
- He's got less than a minute.
- He's cutting it too close.

681
01:06:53,692 --> 01:06:55,198
Oh, come on, boss.

682
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:04,957
Go through the door! Go through the door!

683
01:07:05,037 --> 01:07:09,205
I'm done with the boy.
I'm going after the bitch that spawned him.

684
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:25,120
- There's only one place you're going.
- Yeah. And I'm taking you with me.

685
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:37,530
You remember this?

686
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:42,612
You remember? My wife was
wearing this the night you killed her.

687
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:45,391
I want you to wear it now.

688
01:08:06,299 --> 01:08:08,396
10 seconds.

689
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,435
Cameron!

690
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:17,113
No!

691
01:08:33,926 --> 01:08:37,092
Cameron! You did it!

692
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:43,812
- Cameron?
- Mom.

693
01:08:54,514 --> 01:08:57,312
Oh... thank you.

694
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:02,083
Thank you.

695
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:16,689
Hey, boss.

696
01:09:16,769 --> 01:09:20,309
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Get your thumb out of my face.

697
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:26,341
- You're gonna be just fine, boss.
- Can we take a vacation now?

698
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:29,902
Dad? Can you hear me?

699
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:32,938
Is it you, Dad?

700
01:09:34,787 --> 01:09:37,839
<i>Dad? Dad?</i>

701
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,412
Dad!

702
01:09:39,492 --> 01:09:42,690
Dad? Dad?

703
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:46,128
Mom! Dad's awake.

704
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:51,357
- Hey.
- Where am I? Anna?

705
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:53,862
Can you hear us?

706
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:59,182
- What happened?
- We were in a car accident.

707
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:02,134
- The car went off the road.
- A woman hit us.

708
01:10:02,214 --> 01:10:05,037
No, no, honey. You swerved around a jogger.

709
01:10:05,817 --> 01:10:08,049
You don't remember.

710
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:12,355
You had a concussion. The doctor
said that you might be disoriented.

711
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:18,627
You were in a coma for three days.

712
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:25,324
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

713
01:10:25,404 --> 01:10:26,736
Yeah?

714
01:11:15,054 --> 01:11:17,086
Felt so real.

715
01:11:22,662 --> 01:11:24,690
Everything's gonna be okay.

716
01:11:43,415 --> 01:11:45,163
Honey, this way.

717
01:11:45,243 --> 01:11:47,740
Hey, Dad. So you up for some
one-on-one when we get home?

718
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,042
No basketball for him, honey.
He needs to rest.

719
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:52,445
Then can we play on the Wii?

720
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,290
I'd like that, Jake.

721
01:11:57,796 --> 01:11:59,651
I love you.

722
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:01,563
I love you.

723
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,876
Honey, what's wrong?

724
01:12:16,856 --> 01:12:18,684
Dad, what is it?

725
01:12:20,786 --> 01:12:22,292
What's wrong?

726
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:25,420
No.

727
01:12:29,028 --> 01:12:30,817
You're not real.

728
01:12:31,897 --> 01:12:35,955
- Seth. Seth, don't say that.
- I love you both.

729
01:12:36,035 --> 01:12:37,790
- You're not real.
- Dad!

730
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:40,769
- Seth, come back!
- Dad!

731
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:44,564
Going somewhere?

732
01:12:44,644 --> 01:12:46,332
Maggie.

733
01:12:48,047 --> 01:12:49,636
Oh, shit!

734
01:12:57,222 --> 01:12:59,921
- No!
- Maggie!

735
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,105
Why don't you just kill me?

736
01:13:03,185 --> 01:13:05,818
Because I want you to hurt, Seth.

737
01:13:05,898 --> 01:13:08,464
I want you to know pain.

738
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,535
You're gonna burn, Seth.

739
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,921
Think! Think! Think!

740
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:52,240
Oh, my God!

741
01:14:35,087 --> 01:14:37,118
Let him go.

742
01:14:38,357 --> 01:14:40,580
I'll stop fighting.

743
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,692
You can have me.

744
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,576
Release him or I'll jump.

745
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:56,005
- Open the door!
- Open the door, Cameron!

746
01:14:56,085 --> 01:14:58,764
Cameron! Cameron, buddy,
we need you to open the door.

747
01:14:58,844 --> 01:15:01,916
- Cameron, we need you to open this door.
- Cameron!

748
01:15:02,046 --> 01:15:06,171
Can you hear me, buddy? Can you hear me?
Just come open the door.

749
01:15:21,766 --> 01:15:23,689
No, Oliver!

750
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,691
Boss?

751
01:15:36,915 --> 01:15:38,980
It's injected!

752
01:15:43,155 --> 01:15:44,914
Boss...

753
01:15:48,894 --> 01:15:50,761
Boss?

754
01:15:54,366 --> 01:15:56,188
Boss?

755
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,614
No!

756
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,865
You end now, bitch!

757
01:16:19,945 --> 01:16:21,981
No!

758
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,772
No!

759
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:37,296
No! No! Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

760
01:17:35,334 --> 01:17:37,223
Let's move!

761
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:42,821
Here we go. The guy's in shock. Clear!

762
01:17:46,911 --> 01:17:48,737
Here we go. Clear!

763
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,773
Come on, Ember, fight.

764
01:17:55,553 --> 01:17:58,243
Here we go again. Clear.

765
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:09,270
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, just one more time.

766
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,849
- Ma'am.
- Now!

767
01:18:14,906 --> 01:18:17,996
Clear, all clear. Clear!

768
01:18:32,257 --> 01:18:34,722
Oh, my God. We've got a pulse.

769
01:18:36,895 --> 01:18:39,085
We've got a rhythm!

770
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,737
Alright. Let's get another bag here.

771
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:44,316
What's our ETA?

772
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:09,591
We're losing him!

773
01:19:11,596 --> 01:19:14,063
Guy's in shock. Clear!
