1
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,714
Come on, Cameron.

2
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,666
Is it Dad?

3
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,536
No.

4
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,287
Come on, let's cook.

5
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,956
What are we eating?

6
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,050
Spaghetti?

7
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,133
Or spaghetti?

8
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,766
Come on. Help me
make the sauce.

9
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,959
Lindsey, what are you doing?
Answer the phone.

10
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,487
Hey, you can't
ignore me, all right?

11
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,717
He's my kid, too.
I have...

12
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,003
All right, look.
I'm sorry, okay?

13
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,680
Just... Just let me
talk to him.

14
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,724
Look, I... I didn't mean
to hit him, okay?

15
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,624
It was an accident, all right? I would
never intentionally hurt him like that,

16
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,435
you know that, okay?
And I've apologized.

17
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,374
I mean, what the hell
do you want from me?

18
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,151
Honey?

19
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,993
Everything okay in there?

20
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,403
One second, Mom.

21
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,375
You okay?

22
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,033
Mom?

23
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,609
Mom!

24
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,864
What... Hey...

25
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,215
Cameron?

26
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,251
Oh, it could
be important.

27
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,711
More important
than right now?

28
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,470
No.

29
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,303
Can I help you?

30
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,227
Yeah. You could have
answered your damn phone.

31
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,642
It's time to go, Henry.

32
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,478
How do you
know my name?

33
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,796
Do you want me
to call security?

34
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,185
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

35
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,237
Who are you?
What's this about?

36
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,404
Look at your watch.

37
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,982
What's it say?

38
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,695
1:46.

39
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,698
It's been 1:46 since
you came in here.

40
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,329
My watch froze.
So what?

41
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,728
I guarantee you every
watch and clock in this place

42
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,037
says the exact same thing.

43
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,202
All right, crazy guy.

44
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,704
Security.

45
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,039
Time for you to go.

46
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,125
You know what this is?

47
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,470
Something important to you.

48
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,222
It's to help you remember
who you really are.

49
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,469
My brother gave me this
when I became partner.

50
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,100
That's right.
You're a lawyer, Henry.

51
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,853
You work all the time. You have
no social life. You don't go out.

52
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,104
And to be painfully honest,

53
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,687
women don't even look
in your general direction.

54
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,189
We're not in a nightclub.

55
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,570
You're not surrounded
by beautiful women.

56
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,193
Wake up, buddy.

57
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,703
We're in your head.

58
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,911
It's time
for you to go.

59
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,661
That's rude.

60
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,754
Whoa!

61
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,089
You gave them
the power, Henry.

62
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,685
You can take it back.

63
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,049
He's just messing
with you, babe.

64
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,184
Is that all you got?

65
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,401
Looking for Maggie?

66
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,192
Where is she?
She says she's so very sorry

67
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,360
about your little boy.

68
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,448
Fuck you.

69
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,775
Get him out of here.

70
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,322
Better luck next time.

71
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,949
Look out the
window, Henry.

72
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,295
Something wrong, Henry?

73
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,619
Come on!
Oh...

74
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
What the...

75
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,616
Don't look at them!
Keep moving!

76
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,346
I'm losing my mind!
I'm losing my mind!

77
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,689
Oh, shit!
What? What?

78
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,580
Come on. Did you really think I was
going to make it that easy for you?

79
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,198
What's your
favorite color?

80
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,970
I don't have a favorite.
What color is your car?

81
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,474
Your best suit?
Your favorite sweater?

82
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,537
Come on!
What?

83
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,475
Henry, I need to make an escape route,
something true to you.

84
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,205
Answer the question.
Green.

85
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,374
Where the fuck did that come from?
Come on!

86
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,171
What the hell is this?

87
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,919
This is where we break
down the illusion.

88
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,756
If you want to wake up
from this, jump.

89
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,968
Fuck that!

90
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,520
Open the door!
Henry, let me in!

91
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,188
But baby...

92
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,435
But your eyes are black.

93
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,518
Baby, he slipped
something into your drink!

94
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,978
Henry, jump! Now!

95
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,322
You won't get another chance.
You can't make me do this.

96
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,898
I can't make you
do anything, Henry.

97
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,409
You have
to believe it will work.

98
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,954
Henry, come on,
open the door. Let me in!

99
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,369
You go first. If that
would help you, I would.

100
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,117
You have to make
the choice.

101
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,292
Come with me, Henry.

102
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,443
No!

103
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,481
No! No!

104
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,453
All right.

105
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,207
Rise and shine, boss.

106
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,956
You did it.

107
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,965
Another one bites
the dust, huh?

108
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,293
Welcome back
to reality.

109
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,427
How many fingers
am I holding up?

110
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,178
Oliver, get your damn
thumb out of my face.

111
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,009
All right, you'll live.

112
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,554
Maggie wasn't there.

113
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,438
After 15 dives,
we've lost her.

114
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,654
I know.

115
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,004
But we'll get her.
She can't hide forever.

116
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,027
She's taunting me, Oliver.

117
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,325
It's a game to her.

118
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,574
You...

119
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,284
You were in my dream.

120
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,548
It wasn't a fuckin' dream.

121
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,605
No!

122
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,338
This is going to be the end of you.
You know that, right?

123
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:36,187
Well, lower the dosage next time.
We can't lower the dosage.

124
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,098
The problem
is you, boss.

125
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,352
Oh, come on. Look what the
bouncer did to your wrist.

126
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,147
Look, you're adapting.
It's becoming too real.

127
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,012
I'm telling you,
if you don't watch it,

128
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,716
you're going to get
stuck in there.

129
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,034
You're not going soft
on me, are you, Oliver?

130
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,702
I'm just saying,

131
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,752
I don't know, take
a month or two off.

132
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,172
Let your body recover.
You know?

133
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,219
Maggie wasn't there.

134
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,219
Why wasn't she there?

135
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,143
Hey, I dug up all the places

136
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,270
our guy visited before
the possession.

137
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,647
Aside from his office,

138
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,821
he hung out at Starbucks
and low rent strip clubs.

139
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,364
Okay, let's check it out.

140
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,575
I need surveillance tape

141
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,276
on the nights Henry visited.

142
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,743
I want to see who he was hanging
out with at those strip clubs.

143
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,573
I think I just heard
Oliver volunteer.

144
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,118
Oh, you cannot pay
me enough money.

145
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,296
No. Besides, I have a
date with reality tonight.

146
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,248
Well, that sounds intriguing.

147
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,292
What's her name?

148
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,221
Sara.

149
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,504
Wait a minute.
What happened to Jenny?

150
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,764
Jenny?

151
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,762
Jenny wanted to go
skydiving, so...

152
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,854
You broke up with her because
she wanted to go skydiving?

153
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,398
Yeah. You know how I
feel about high places.

154
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,770
Hmm.

155
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,935
Oliver, have I
taught you nothing?

156
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,562
Oh, my God,
I almost forgot.

157
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,739
There's someone named Camilla
that's here to see you.

158
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,114
She said she's from
the Andrade Archdiocese.

159
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,451
The Vatican?

160
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,256
Oh, she's hot!

161
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,472
Ugh.

162
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,972
So, should I tell her
to go away?

163
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,894
Tell her she's
got five minutes.

164
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,298
I've been following
your work for quite some time.

165
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,109
I understand you've done three
exorcisms in the last six months.

166
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,450
I prefer to call
them evictions, yes.

167
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:57,991
Why are you here?

168
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,827
My superiors
need an incarnate.

169
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,374
What happened
to Felix Nazra?

170
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,414
They thought perhaps the student
has surpassed the teacher.

171
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,708
Yeah, or they got sick of the
body counts you leave behind.

172
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,960
This situation
needs a scalpel,

173
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,466
not a hammer.

174
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,812
Please.

175
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,867
Camilla, right?

176
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,536
You're wasting
your time.

177
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,582
It's not going to happen.
I don't clock in for the Vatican.

178
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,948
What do you have
against the church?

179
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,211
How much
time you got?

180
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,495
Look, I just don't
believe what I do

181
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,170
belongs to any
one religion.

182
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,340
Exorcising demons?
No, to you, it's a demon.

183
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,195
To others, it's an
unclean spirit, it's jinn.

184
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,056
It's orisha.
It's take your pick, okay?

185
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,808
Really, it's just
a parasitic entity

186
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,435
in a non-corporal
transference.

187
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,024
What if I told you

188
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,023
that parasitic entity
just took a little boy?

189
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,730
I would say it
ain't my problem.

190
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,237
What if I told you
it was Maggie?

191
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,282
I thought that would
get your attention.

192
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,372
Hmm.

193
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,544
Let me guess.

194
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,752
She's holed up in a half-dead
body in a whorehouse

195
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,336
just ready to be taken down.

196
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,139
You need an incarnate because
the ring of St. Vicinius

197
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,246
and a piece of holy cloth
just won't cut it this time.

198
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,039
I'm sorry. I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

199
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,974
Then let me make it
crystal clear.

200
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,960
The last beautiful woman
your superiors sent here

201
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,944
dangled the same carrot.
"We're sure it's Maggie."

202
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,192
Well, surprise, it wasn't.

203
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,606
Just some lesser succubus who
turned a suburban housewife

204
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,282
into a heroin-addicted
throat cutter

205
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,030
who nearly killed me
and my assistants.

206
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,737
Look, I have no idea

207
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,288
about the last
woman they sent.

208
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,620
What I do know is that
I have an archdemon

209
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,169
possessing the body of an
innocent 11 -year-old boy.

210
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,380
We believe that arch is
that entity you call Maggie.

211
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,667
So if you and
your assistants

212
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,422
really want to
take her out,

213
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,386
give me a call.

214
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,884
Just don't wait too long.

215
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,058
The boy won't survive
more than three days.

216
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,674
Ember.

217
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,291
Is it her?

218
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,051
Why don't you come inside?

219
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,937
So, this is what
Vatican money buys?

220
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,191
Can I offer you anything?

221
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,275
I just need to know,
Felix. Is it Maggie?

222
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,856
Uncertain.

223
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,901
The church has excluded
me from this one.

224
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,737
Why? Because they can't
stomach the murder of a child?

225
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,206
Or because they're afraid they
can't cover it up this time?

226
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,786
Ember, remember
where you are.

227
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,463
Where's that?

228
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,003
With a friend.

229
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,808
Remember the first thing I taught you
about entering other people's minds?

230
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,395
Humans are easily blinded
by their needs and desires.

231
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,398
It would serve you well
to remember that.

232
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,022
We each have
our methods.

233
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,561
We each have
our motives.

234
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,467
This conversation wouldn't
have lasted this long

235
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,981
if you didn't
know it was her.

236
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,363
You know it's her,
don't you?

237
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,036
Yes.

238
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,286
But if you haven't
spoken to the church,

239
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,494
how do you know?

240
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,666
I wanna show
you something.

241
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,465
The door's glass
is four inches thick.

242
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,263
A rhino couldn't crack it.

243
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,094
There are 12 cameras
inside and out,

244
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,474
monitored 24 hours a day.

245
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,646
Fantastic.

246
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,022
What is it?

247
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,901
I found the light
agitates it.

248
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,027
Is that a person? You've got
somebody locked up in there?

249
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,534
Remember the incarnate
who disappeared last year?

250
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,373
Luca Rejick.

251
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,727
Oh, shit!

252
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,392
This hasn't been Luca Rejick
in a long time, I'm afraid.

253
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,350
What are you
doing with him?

254
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,060
They know a lot about us.

255
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,196
Isn't it time we
learned more about them?

256
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,328
Jesus!

257
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,245
Did you know they've been trying
to infiltrate our ranks for years?

258
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,412
He told me.

259
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,365
He also told me
about the boy,

260
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,334
about Maggie.
That's how I know.

261
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,831
What am I waiting for?

262
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,834
Don't you want to know
how to beat her?

263
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,541
You know, Ember,
sometimes...

264
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,927
In order to avoid the
fate worse than death,

265
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,053
you must choose
death instead.

266
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,101
And thanks to Luca here,

267
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,595
I was able to develop this.

268
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,684
What is it?

269
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,558
C-79.

270
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,651
In this vial

271
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,937
is a moment
of clarity.

272
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,317
What are you
talking about?

273
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,696
It's a serum made in part from
the blood of our friend here.

274
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,861
Should Maggie get
the upper hand,

275
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,288
and I hope she doesn't,

276
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,661
this will give you
approximately 10 seconds

277
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,119
of lucidity in order to do
what needs to be done.

278
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,835
Inject this
and you'll wake up

279
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,292
with just enough time
to end your life

280
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,252
before she traps
you forever.

281
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,629
You seriously think
I'm going to use this?

282
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,558
Look, Felix,

283
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,386
I appreciate everything
you taught me,

284
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,937
but keep your poison.

285
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,266
I'm not planning on dying.

286
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,745
Hello.

287
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,327
All right, Camilla.

288
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,500
Let's talk.

289
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,589
The boy's name
is Cameron Sparrow.

290
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,761
His parents just
recently divorced.

291
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,714
The mother is
originally from Holland.

292
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,217
She has a restraining
order against the father,

293
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,643
an alcoholic.

294
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,936
He broke the boy's arm.

295
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,231
Does Cameron have
any history of

296
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,731
schizophrenia, delusion,
any meds I should know about?

297
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,561
No, nothing in
his records.

298
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,396
The mother heard him
scream in the kitchen.

299
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,822
And when she arrived,

300
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,740
she found this.

301
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,822
The boy broke her neck.

302
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,662
Of course, we sent
in the best exorcists

303
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,493
to handle the
situation, but...

304
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,746
They failed.

305
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,837
How does it transfer?

306
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,467
Physical contact.

307
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,198
Judging from its
trail of victims,

308
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,587
it can only possess
the weak,

309
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,298
kids, the elderly,
sick people.

310
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,469
I haven't told the mother about
your connection with Maggie.

311
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,929
Is the boy quarantined?

312
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,889
No one has touched
Cameron in a week.

313
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,767
How's the mother's will?

314
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,852
She's tired.
She's been through a lot.

315
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,805
We're keeping her
away from the boy.

316
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,784
I've already answered
these questions 1,000 times.

317
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,905
Who are you?

318
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,239
Mrs. Sparrow...
Just Lindsey.

319
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,369
No... No Mrs.

320
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,209
Lindsey, we brought
Dr. Ember to help you.

321
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,287
Another priest. Great.

322
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,667
No, he's not a priest.

323
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,919
He's like a therapist.

324
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,501
I'm not here to treat
your son for mental illness.

325
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,046
Then why are you here?

326
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,868
I'm here to evaluate
whether or not...

327
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,757
Dr. Ember has employed
a cutting-edge method

328
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,308
for helping his patients.

329
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,136
He can go places we can't,

330
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,597
get information that otherwise
would be unavailable to us.

331
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,432
You're here to perform
an exorcism, right?

332
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,422
Let's get this straight right off the bat,
I don't do exorcisms.

333
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,070
I don't use religious methods
to treat the symptoms.

334
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,072
I go inside
the victim's mind

335
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,861
to treat the disease.

336
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,865
I don't compel
these entities

337
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,570
from the outside.
I evict them...

338
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,822
From the inside.

339
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,707
You evict them?

340
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,207
The entity that is holding
your son has no real power.

341
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,628
It's a parasite.

342
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,873
It feeds off
your son's energy,

343
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,086
but in order to do that, it has
to hold him in a dream state.

344
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,178
Even if his eyes are open
and he's speaking,

345
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,506
your son is asleep.

346
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,931
The entity is
controlling him.

347
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,759
In order to keep
that control,

348
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,312
it has to convince him
his dream is real.

349
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,849
It's holding Cameron by

350
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,230
convincing him he's
in another reality?

351
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,648
Yes.

352
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,234
Through suggestion.

353
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,649
It rifles through his mind

354
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,736
and shows him what
he wants most.

355
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,240
But it's all a lie.

356
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,121
I tear down the lies.

357
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,833
Once Cameron sees the truth,

358
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,957
the entity loses its power.

359
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,376
What happens to the entity?

360
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,841
It'll try to jump into
the nearest living host.

361
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,762
If it can't find
a host, it dies.

362
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,309
And you've done
this before?

363
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,526
Okay, you're
gonna use the strap.

364
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,324
Go, Oliver!

365
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,575
Strap her down!
Strap her down!

366
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,407
Oh, God!

367
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,673
Okay.

368
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,390
Hello, Father.

369
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,889
The boy hasn't
eaten in days.

370
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,635
Why don't you
take a break?

371
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,643
You look like you
need some rest.

372
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,274
He's okay.

373
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,336
It might be best if you
waited in the living room.

374
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:11,998
But I want to see him.

375
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,037
I know. I know,

376
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,714
but you have to trust us.

377
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,250
He'll be fine.

378
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,126
It's gonna be okay.

379
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,101
This is just
an evaluation.

380
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,309
If I can't confirm
this is Maggie,

381
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,561
I'm out of here.

382
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,055
Hello, Dr. Ember.

383
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,596
You know who I am?

384
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,396
How does it feel?

385
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,946
How does what feel?

386
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,785
To lose
the one you love.

387
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,205
Okay.

388
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,377
We've established that
you know who I am.

389
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,763
Who are you?

390
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,134
I've been known as Ash.

391
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,811
Others have called me Plague.

392
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,603
After the Great Deluge,

393
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,687
when the angels took the
mortal women, I was Desire.

394
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,530
Is this fun for you?

395
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:14,329
Holy water, crucifixes
and idle threats get so...

396
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,168
Dull.

397
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,666
What do you want?

398
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:22,128
You're going to have
to try harder than that.

399
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,085
No, I don't have
time for this.

400
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,837
Good!

401
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,018
Ah...

402
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,101
So you do remember.

403
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,692
Hey. Hey! Hey!

404
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,159
Hey, where are you going?

405
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,745
What about the boy?

406
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,537
No, no, no, no!

407
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,956
Wait!

408
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,747
Is it her?

409
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,193
I know what happened
to your family.

410
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,878
Don't you ever
mention my family.

411
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,092
But if this is
an archdemon,

412
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,715
the church needs to know.

413
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,707
A lot of lives could
be in jeopardy.

414
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,512
Then move out of my way so
I can get my team in here.

415
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,761
Then I'd lock that
door if I were you.

416
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,423
I'm coming for you.

417
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,509
The church is pleased
that you have come to help.

418
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,165
Helping? I'm hunting.

419
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,463
Excuse me,
but is this necessary?

420
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,510
Why can I not be in
the same room as my son?

421
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,591
When the shit hits the fan,

422
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,765
I'm going to need everybody
in here out of my hair.

423
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,138
It's safer that way,
believe me.

424
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,639
You should
see an image.

425
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,524
Oh, Cameron...

426
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,536
What is all this stuff?

427
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,618
Um,

428
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,580
this is what we use to monitor
Dr. Ember during dives.

429
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,918
See, each of us is
like a Wi-Fi hot spot,

430
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,754
and our brains give off an
invisible field of energy.

431
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,546
You see this cloud right here?

432
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,802
Some people call
this an aura or soul,

433
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,972
but really what it is is
just a cluster of unique ions

434
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,054
and each of us has
our own frequency.

435
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,266
So this is Dr. Ember's
and this is Cameron's.

436
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,506
You see the black
streaks in Cameron's?

437
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,273
That's the parasite.

438
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,608
When a victim is weak,

439
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,739
it can hook right
into their frequency.

440
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,658
Oh, God!

441
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,827
And so we just use this to monitor
it until we can evict it.

442
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,916
What's all that for?

443
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,622
Uh, this is going to lower his heart
rate and EEG to a stasis state,

444
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,629
we're going to bring him as close
to death as physically possible.

445
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,336
When I hit REM, I'll ride
into Cameron's subconscious,

446
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,676
begin dismantling
the illusion.

447
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,411
The trick is I only
have eight minutes

448
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,518
before my heart gives out,
which isn't a lot of time.

449
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,181
Sometimes we get lucky.
It's as easy as the glitch.

450
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:48,651
The glitch?

451
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,149
The time glitch.

452
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,528
We've discovered that time is
meaningless in the subconscious,

453
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,151
so watches, clocks,

454
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,698
anything that tells time,

455
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,821
freezes at the time of
the victim's possession.

456
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,411
It'll be okay.

457
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,206
I'm gonna help your son.

458
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,178
Okay, boss.
You're good to go.

459
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,602
Keep this area clear
in case she tries to jump.

460
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,376
You know the drill. Don't let the
boy touch you or anyone else.

461
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,231
Don't let me touch you
or anyone else.

462
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,730
Oliver, I get anywhere
near flat-lining,

463
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,436
you yank my ass out
with the Narcan.

464
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,150
I, uh, got the escape
hatch right here, boss.

465
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,781
Only if you
absolutely have to.

466
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,113
Dr. Ember...

467
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,659
Good luck in there.

468
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,708
Thank you.

469
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,860
Dr. Ember, so nice
of you to join us.

470
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,174
Starting the clock, boss.

471
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,928
Are you ready,
Dr. Ember?

472
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,233
Then let the games begin.

473
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,810
All right,
Cameron. Here we go.

474
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,262
I want a fast
ball next, buddy.

475
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,147
Over the plate. Nice!

476
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,525
Nice catch.

477
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,394
Beautiful.

478
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,608
How is he?

479
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,149
Seven minutes to go.

480
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,992
So far, so good.

481
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,537
Cameron.

482
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,408
Cameron.

483
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,660
Listen, I know you
don't know me,

484
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,337
but I'm here to help you.

485
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,289
I just want to talk.

486
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,213
What's wrong?

487
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,671
You're... You're bleeding.

488
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,817
Help! We need
help over here.

489
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,519
- Oh, no...
- Cameron.

490
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,024
Cameron,
come with me, buddy.

491
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,199
Come on.

492
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,779
Wait. Cameron! It's okay.
It'll be okay.

493
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,826
Sir, please, lie down.

494
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,284
No, no, no, no.
Lie down, lie down.

495
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,710
You need to lie down.
This is serious. No, no.

496
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,797
Hold on.

497
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,721
Oh, crap!

498
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,110
He's going to flat-line.

499
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,983
There's a man bleeding.

500
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,610
I'm in the southeast
section of Douglas Park.

501
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,783
Get away from me.
This isn't happening.

502
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,655
You have to calm down.

503
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,411
I'm not sure what's wrong.

504
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,034
Sir, I think I've
found your problem.

505
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,178
I'm sorry, boss.

506
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,508
Your EKGs were off the chart,
okay, so we had to pull you out.

507
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,312
Well, I'm not going
to say I told you so.

508
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,817
Yeah, well, you just did.

509
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,261
All right, boss, let's
get you to the hospital

510
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,445
and get you
checked out, okay?

511
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,451
I'm fine, Oliver.

512
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,449
You're fine?

513
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,781
What the hell
happened in there?

514
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,367
It was only a few
minutes, Oliver.

515
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,832
A couple of minutes?

516
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,793
Boss, your heart stopped.

517
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,386
Where are you going?

518
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,431
Dan used to play
in the park with Cameron.

519
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,849
Before he lost his job.

520
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,434
The entity is playing
into Cameron's desire.

521
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,557
His desire?

522
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,724
That man has never said
"I love you" once to that boy.

523
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,714
Cameron doesn't want anything to
do with his father, believe me.

524
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,194
Well, maybe you
don't want that,

525
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,241
but I'm telling you, Dan
was in the park with him.

526
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,858
She's giving him
what he wants.

527
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,531
We need to break
down her illusion.

528
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,742
It's the only way
to free the boy.

529
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,997
Where's his father?

530
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,066
He's probably out
getting drunk.

531
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,125
We need to
bring him here.

532
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,081
That man is not coming
anywhere near my son.

533
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,042
Listen...
He broke Cameron's arm!

534
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,718
This entity is strong.

535
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,967
Probably the strongest
I've ever encountered.

536
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,845
To get your son back, I'm going to
need all the ammunition I can get.

537
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,205
No, it's not going to happen. I'm sorry.
Damn it, listen to me!

538
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,844
I am too close.

539
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,063
I have come too far.

540
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,685
So you either work with me,
or you lose your son.

541
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,817
Mrs. Sparrow, just please
tell us where to find him.

542
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,172
There's a bar on 20th
and Scarborough.

543
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,168
That's where
he usually goes.

544
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,088
Thank you.

545
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,982
You know
I'm so old-fashioned

546
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,273
I'm so old-fashioned

547
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,528
Hey!

548
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,073
I'm in a wheelchair.

549
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,870
I can see you're not
a fan of self-preservation.

550
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,074
Yeah, not much
left to preserve.

551
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,749
Is that self-pity I hear?

552
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,998
No. That's freedom, baby.

553
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,541
Freedom.

554
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,338
Focus on the important shit.

555
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,510
Hmm, found him.

556
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,554
Mr. Sparrow...

557
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,439
Your son's in trouble.
I need you to come with me.

558
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,180
What are you,
another lawyer?

559
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,814
I look like a lawyer?

560
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,482
Your son is in trouble.

561
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,027
Yeah, well...

562
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,155
I need another beer,
so unless you're buying...

563
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,825
You're so funny.

564
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,004
Okay, you want me
to break your arm, huh?

565
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,074
I don't know what they told you.
I never touched him.

566
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,508
I don't give a shit.

567
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,181
I said your son's in trouble

568
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,100
because of you.

569
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:47,641
Dr. Ember!

570
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,646
Ember, stop!

571
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,619
Why didn't you call me?

572
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,628
You're here, aren't you?

573
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,395
Jesus Christ, Lindsey, how long were
you going to keep this from me?

574
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,295
Why would I
tell you anything?

575
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,126
Because he's my son!

576
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,053
If we're done
flirting here,

577
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,840
Cameron needs us.

578
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,926
Dan, you need to go
with Dr. Ember now.

579
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,022
Show me where my son is.

580
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,559
With pleasure.

581
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,532
Call him by his name.

582
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,680
Remind him you're in the room.
Tell him you love him.

583
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,320
Talk about details that only
you and he would know about,

584
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,122
okay?

585
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,665
He'll hear you.

586
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,409
He'll wake up.

587
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,689
Are you sure
this is going to work?

588
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,249
No, I'm not.

589
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,253
Then why should I do this?
I would,

590
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,087
if it were my son.

591
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,740
Like I said before,
I don't know what they told you,

592
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,925
okay, but I never
touched him, okay? Ever.

593
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,016
I never touched him.

594
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,341
Save that for Cameron.

595
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,435
All right,
we have your back.

596
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,205
If something goes wrong, you get a
bad feeling, we'll get you out.

597
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,440
Like what?

598
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,213
What's going to happen?
Like green vomit?

599
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,024
What, are you talking about the
whole head-turning thing? Come on!

600
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,525
No matter what,
don't touch him.

601
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,197
Come on.
Dan, I mean it.

602
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:24,696
No physical contact.

603
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,947
Do you understand me?

604
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:30,035
Yeah, I won't touch him.

605
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,290
Let's go.

606
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,478
Hey, Cam.

607
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,065
It's me, it's Dad.

608
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,479
It's been a while, buddy.

609
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,989
I haven't seen you
in, like, forever.

610
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,680
You know, I tried
calling you a few times.

611
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,624
I guess my messages
weren't getting through, huh?

612
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,999
I remember you had
that sick curve ball.

613
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,662
It was just me and you
down at the park.

614
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:21,343
You were good, man.

615
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,543
You should try out
for the team.

616
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,005
Cameron,

617
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,722
it's Dad.

618
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,427
Slow and easy.

619
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,529
It's working.
Cameron's surfacing.

620
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,032
Dad?

621
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,785
Yeah, buddy, it's me.
It's Dad.

622
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,339
Cameron, I'm so sorry.

623
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,882
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

624
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,418
You've got to believe me.

625
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,878
It was an accident.

626
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,805
If I could take it back,
I'd take it back.

627
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,522
What do we got?

628
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,646
There's a lot
of movement.

629
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,981
It's bouncing around
all over the place.

630
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,485
What happened to you,
Cameron?

631
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,686
How did this happen?

632
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,071
I forgive you.

633
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,281
What? I can't...

634
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,571
I can't hear you, buddy.

635
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:30,993
Say... Say it again.

636
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,738
I forgive you, Dad.

637
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,914
You do?

638
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,917
I want it to be
like it was.

639
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,999
Can it be like before?

640
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,050
Yeah, it can be
like before.

641
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,253
I promise.

642
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,096
I'm going to clean up.

643
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,673
Okay?

644
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,550
I'll do anything for you.

645
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,599
Can we go
to the park again?

646
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,098
We can go to the park.

647
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,684
We can go to a carnival.

648
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,518
You want to go on the rides?

649
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,604
We can do all that.

650
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,614
Really?

651
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,030
Really, just as soon
as you're better, okay?

652
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,447
I love you, Dad.

653
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,085
Here.

654
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,379
Oh, my God!

655
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,466
Don't touch him!

656
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,674
Oh, God!

657
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,342
God is not here.

658
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,258
Stop! Don't do this.

659
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,301
It's me you want.

660
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,286
Please follow me.

661
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,167
Our people are downstairs.

662
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,648
Why did you say,
"It's me you want"?

663
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,482
There's something
you're not telling me.

664
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,698
You're not here
to help Cameron.

665
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,571
You're here
for some other reason.

666
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,368
It doesn't matter why I'm here.

667
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,827
Dan is dead.

668
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,084
What the hell
is going on here?

669
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,958
Talk to me
or get the hell out!

670
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:03,975
When I was 26,

671
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,314
I discovered
that when I was asleep,

672
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,069
I could go into the minds
of the possessed.

673
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,367
When I found out
there were others like me,

674
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,622
and how their lives
had been turned upside-down,

675
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,331
I kept my abilities hidden.

676
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,085
I just wanted a normal life,

677
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,049
and that's what I had.

678
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,328
No...

679
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,368
She was possessed?

680
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,447
Her name was Maggie Grant.

681
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,992
She was possessed
by the same entity

682
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,497
that's in Cameron.

683
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,413
She sensed my ability.

684
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,135
She killed my wife
and my 11 -year-old boy.

685
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,634
After that...

686
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,177
I have no turning back.

687
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,523
Since then,
I've used every ability I have

688
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,272
to try to find her
and kill her.

689
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,775
You're not here
to help my son.

690
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,450
No, I'm not.

691
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:10,416
In all these years,
why hasn't she just killed you?

692
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,795
There are fates
worse than death.

693
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,028
I was afraid of this.

694
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,914
She's feeding!

695
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,159
What's happening?

696
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,459
Maggie is feeding.

697
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,036
She's consuming
Cameron's energy.

698
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,084
We need to move fast.

699
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,377
Boss, boss!

700
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,296
The kid's got
maybe two hours, max.

701
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:06,597
What's the call?

702
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,265
Don't let anyone near him.

703
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,138
Do whatever it takes
to keep him alive.

704
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,309
What?
Where are you going?

705
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,687
To get the edge I need
to end this.

706
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,778
Keep it running.

707
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,698
Felix.

708
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:34,954
Hello?

709
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,330
Felix?

710
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,755
Felix.

711
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,591
Felix, you here?

712
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,613
Felix!

713
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,574
Felix!

714
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,825
Felix!

715
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,209
It's Ember.

716
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,376
What happened?

717
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,961
I was harvesting more blood,

718
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,539
and he broke through
the straightjacket and bolted.

719
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,374
Where are you hurt?

720
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,593
It's not my blood.
I cut him.

721
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,581
Ember, we've got
to get out of here.

722
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,723
I think he's still here.

723
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,634
All right. Let's move.

724
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,100
How the...

725
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,269
Oops!

726
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,438
Felix.

727
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,231
No.

728
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,112
Stay back.

729
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,485
Or what?

730
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,216
What are you waiting for?

731
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,644
Ember, if only you had...

732
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,447
Felix, Felix.

733
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,275
Maggie wants you
for herself.

734
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,655
No, Felix.

735
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,032
She's going to consume you.

736
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,697
Felix!
Pray you die so easily.

737
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,792
Felix! No!

738
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,394
Where have you been?

739
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,726
I had to get something.

740
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,227
How is he?
He's stable.

741
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,338
He hasn't moved
since you left.

742
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,772
All right, let's go.

743
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,320
Where do you think
you're going?

744
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,448
I'm going back in.

745
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,109
No, you're not.

746
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,906
I need to talk to you.

747
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:47,748
Look, I don't know
where you went,

748
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,150
but you're not going
to go back in.

749
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,584
I'm calling in my people.

750
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,070
If you were going to
call in your people

751
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:53,696
to contain this thing,
you would have already done it.

752
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,906
What happens
when this entity's

753
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,761
done with the kid
and decides to jump?

754
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,590
She's not going to jump.
Why not?

755
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,925
Because it's me she wants.

756
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,304
I'm sport to her,

757
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,227
which is why
I'm your best shot right now.

758
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,024
I need a physical item
of Cameron's,

759
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,147
something special to him.

760
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,318
Why?

761
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,354
We'll need to find a truth

762
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,406
that she can't distort.

763
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,485
Intimate truth
that he won't question.

764
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,280
It's our only chance
of shattering this illusion,

765
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,657
pulling him out.

766
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,546
This ring,
you know where it is?

767
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,305
Cameron used to keep this
by his bed,

768
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,684
and when we left,
I took it away.

769
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,730
I wanted as few traces
of his father as possible.

770
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,099
I can't think of anything

771
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,902
Cameron treasured
more than this

772
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,729
stupid ring.

773
00:58:56,992 --> 00:59:00,325
You can tell me to shut up
anytime you want, but, uh...

774
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,362
I think Cameron loves
his father,

775
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,912
but that doesn't mean
he doesn't love you.

776
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,419
I mean, Cameron might not
know how to say it, but...

777
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,465
I mean, you're his rock.

778
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,835
You're his entire world.

779
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,472
He needs you now
more than ever.

780
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:24,891
Lindsey.

781
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,981
I need you to be strong.

782
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,566
We're getting close.

783
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,609
She shouldn't have
killed Dan.

784
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,271
Maggie's getting sloppy

785
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,980
and we will use that
against her.

786
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,486
I'm going to get
your son back.

787
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,414
I thought you didn't care.

788
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,662
Yeah, well...

789
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,292
I lied.

790
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,196
Here.

791
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,408
You sure about this?

792
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,039
If I get the boy out

793
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,792
and I'm still down,
you get that into my IV.

794
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,333
If it works, it'll buy me
just enough time.

795
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,510
Enough time for what?

796
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,722
Enough time
to get the job done.

797
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,016
Whatever you say, boss.

798
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,495
- Oliver, you got the Narcan?
- Yeah.

799
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,408
Right here. Ready to go.

800
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,913
Let me see it.

801
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,715
I won't be
needing this anymore.

802
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,453
I hope you said
your goodbyes,

803
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:55,914
because you won't be
coming back.

804
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,036
Maybe,

805
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,839
but neither will you.

806
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,443
Sir?

807
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,775
Sir?

808
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,116
Are you going to take
your ticket or not?

809
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,774
All right. Here we go.

810
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:09,952
Cam, look at that.

811
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,826
That looks good, man.

812
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,913
Hey, Cameron.
How about some cotton candy?

813
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,162
Oh, Jesus, I will never
get used to that.

814
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,868
You're telling me.

815
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,674
Cameron!

816
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,639
Cameron!

817
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,855
Cameron!

818
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,856
Dad, it's that guy from the park.
Don't worry.

819
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,284
Cameron,
I'm here to help you.

820
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,349
Why don't you back off before
someone gets hurt, yeah?

821
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,909
This is not your father,
Cameron.

822
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,115
This is not real.

823
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,249
What are you
talking about?

824
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,496
I know it's confusing.

825
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:01,731
You're just going
to have to trust me, okay?

826
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,962
Dad!
Get away from my son!

827
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,718
You know what, this is going
to end badly for you, man.

828
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:12,178
Cameron,
don't be afraid.

829
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,715
Do you remember this ring?

830
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,223
You used to sleep with it,
remember?

831
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,311
Dad?

832
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,809
It's not your dad, Cameron.

833
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:24,068
It looks like your dad

834
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,546
and it's saying everything
you want to hear,

835
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,650
but it's not your father.

836
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:27,818
Give me the ring, Cameron.

837
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,897
You know what?
You're a freaking psycho.

838
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,947
You stay away from my son.

839
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,401
You know I'd
never hurt you, son.

840
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:35,576
Okay?

841
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,203
I love you, Cameron.

842
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:38,989
Cameron?

843
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,000
Your father could never
say he loved you.

844
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,314
Have you ever heard him
say those words?

845
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,216
Don't listen to him,
Cam. Okay?

846
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,794
Hey, I said get out of here.

847
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,422
You know your dad
better than anyone.

848
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,098
This is not your dad.

849
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,891
Don't listen to him, Cameron.

850
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,227
Sorry, sorry.

851
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,890
What's wrong, Cam?

852
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:06,812
Dad?

853
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,358
What's wrong, buddy?
Why you looking at me like that?

854
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,525
It's not your dad, Cameron.

855
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,344
This guy's done
something to you, Cam.

856
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:15,029
Stay away from me!

857
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,953
I would never hurt you, ever.

858
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,910
You're not my dad.

859
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,283
Cameron, stop!

860
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,623
He's coming up
on four minutes.

861
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,580
Cameron!

862
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,799
Stay away from me!
Cameron.

863
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,126
Cameron, trust me.

864
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:34,323
I'm not going to
hurt you, okay?

865
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,462
What's happening?

866
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,598
Cameron!

867
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,717
Come on!

868
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,604
Cameron!

869
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,483
Come back, Cameron!
Come back!

870
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,186
Come on.
We've got to keep moving.

871
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,360
Don't trust him!

872
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,535
He's a bad man.

873
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,453
He wants to hurt you.

874
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,156
Cameron!

875
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,037
Shh. It's okay.

876
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,706
What's wrong with me?

877
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,161
There's nothing wrong
with you.

878
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,080
This isn't real.

879
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,836
It feels real.

880
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,416
That's because
you believe it.

881
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,628
Stop believing it,
I promise you it'll go away.

882
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,759
You can make
all of this disappear.

883
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,536
I just need you to
listen to me right now.

884
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,175
Can you do that?

885
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,727
Okay.
Okay.

886
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:25,934
Do you have
a favorite color?

887
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,107
Blue.
Oh, that's good.

888
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,525
Mine, too.

889
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:36,402
You see that blue door?

890
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,655
It's your world, Cameron.

891
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,077
You can control
everything in it.

892
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,993
It's your way out.

893
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,700
Hurry, your mom
is waiting for you.

894
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:54,753
Go ahead.

895
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,050
It's going to be okay.

896
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,591
Now you're in trouble,
Cameron.

897
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,875
Go through the door, Cameron.

898
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,231
Now! You won't get
another chance.

899
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,939
He's got less
than a minute.

900
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,070
He's cutting it too close.

901
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,785
Oh, come on, boss.

902
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,122
I'm done with the boy.

903
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,583
I'm going after the bitch
that spawned her.

904
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,137
There's only one place
you're going.

905
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,393
Yeah? And I'm
taking you with me.

906
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,402
You remember this?

907
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:05,664
You remember?

908
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,870
No!

909
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,582
My wife was wearing this
the night you killed her.

910
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:11,246
I want you to wear it now.

911
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:34,568
Ten seconds.

912
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,150
Cameron!

913
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:44,238
No!

914
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,592
Cameron!

915
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,680
You did it!

916
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,509
Cameron?

917
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:10,934
Mom!

918
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,648
Oh, thank you.

919
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:28,953
Thank you.

920
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:43,384
Hey, boss.

921
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,924
How many fingers
am I holding up?

922
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,589
Get your thumb
out of my face.

923
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,638
You're going to be
just fine, boss.

924
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,185
Can we take
a vacation now?

925
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,640
Dad, can you hear me?

926
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,356
Is it you, Dad?

927
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,230
Dad?

928
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,065
Dad?

929
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,576
Dad?

930
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:07,786
Dad?

931
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,079
Dad?

932
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,613
Mom, Dad's awake.

933
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:18,249
- Hey.
- Where am I, Anna?

934
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,330
Can you hear us?

935
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,136
What happened?

936
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,423
We were in
a car accident.

937
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,421
The car went off the road.

938
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:29,676
A woman hit us.

939
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,803
No, no, honey.
You swerved around a jogger.

940
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,643
You don't remember.

941
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:39,565
You had a concussion. The doctor
said that you might be disoriented.

942
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:45,943
You were in a coma
for three days.

943
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,033
How you doing, buddy?

944
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,909
Good.
Yeah?

945
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,996
It felt so real.

946
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,050
Everything's going to be okay.

947
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,108
Honey, this way.

948
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:13,286
Hey, Dad.

949
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,182
So are you up for some
one-on-one when we get home?

950
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,350
Oh, no basketball
for him, honey.

951
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,454
He needs to rest.
What?

952
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,248
Then can we play
on the Wii?

953
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,293
I'd like that, Jake.

954
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:26,748
I love you.

955
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,260
I love you.

956
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,387
Honey, what's wrong?

957
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:45,892
Dad, what is it?

958
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,729
What's wrong?

959
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,235
No.

960
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,078
You're not real!

961
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,873
Seth, Seth, don't say that.

962
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,167
I love you both.

963
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:04,372
You're not real.

964
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,498
Dad!

965
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,171
Seth, come back!
Dad!

966
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,922
Going somewhere?

967
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,423
Maggie!

968
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:16,805
Oh, shit!

969
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,518
No!

970
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,895
Maggie.

971
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,103
Why don't you just kill me?

972
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:33,152
Because I want you
to hurt, Seth.

973
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:35,282
I want you to know pain.

974
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,950
You're going to burn, Seth.

975
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,221
Think!

976
01:13:58,309 --> 01:13:59,640
Think! Think!

977
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,620
Oh, my God!

978
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,540
Let him go.

979
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,120
I'll stop fighting.

980
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,586
You can have me.

981
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,546
Release him, or I'll jump.

982
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,714
Open the door!

983
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,344
Open the door,
Cameron!

984
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:24,801
Cameron.
Cameron, buddy,

985
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,055
we need you to open the door.

986
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,520
Cameron, we need you
to open this door.

987
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:29,892
- Cameron!
- Okay?

988
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,475
Can you hear me, buddy?
Cameron, just come open the door.

989
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,580
No, Oliver!

990
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:51,921
Boss?

991
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,268
It's injected!

992
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:11,608
Boss?

993
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,611
Boss?

994
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,112
Boss?

995
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,417
No!

996
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:46,799
You end now, bitch!

997
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:50,727
No!

998
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,607
Stop! Stop! Don't touch him!

999
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:04,908
Don't touch him!

1000
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,218
Let's move!

1001
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,260
Okay, here we go.
This guy's in shock. Clear.

1002
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,392
Here we go. Clear.

1003
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,606
Come on, Ember, fight.

1004
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:24,859
Here we go again. Clear.

1005
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,663
I'm sorry. No, no, just...
Just one more time.

1006
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,540
Ma'am.
Now!

1007
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,340
Clear. All clear.

1008
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:44,427
Clear.

1009
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,100
Oh, my God,
we've got a pulse!

1010
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,196
We've got a rhythm!

1011
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:09,237
All right.
Let's get another bag here.

1012
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:10,864
What's our ETA?

1013
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,473
We're losing him!

1014
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,314
Take this off. Clear.
