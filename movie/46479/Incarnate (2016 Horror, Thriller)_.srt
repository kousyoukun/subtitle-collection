 -Any meds I should know about 
  -No. Nothing in his records.

  The mother heard him scream   
        in the kitchen.         

335
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,882

    -Then why are you here     
 -To evaluate whether or not... 

357
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:10,714
     Dr Ember has employed      
     a cutting-edge method      

358
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,616
   for helping his patients.    

359
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,318
   He can go places we can't,

     be unavailable to us.

362
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,125
  Let's get this straight off   
 the bat. I don't do exorcisms. 

363
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,228
 I don't use religious methods  
     to treat the symptoms.     

364
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,430
 I go inside the victim's mind  

365

     to treat the disease.      

366
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,434
 I don't compel these entities
