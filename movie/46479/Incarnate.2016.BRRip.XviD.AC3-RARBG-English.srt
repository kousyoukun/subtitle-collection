to go skydiving, so...

- No, to you, it's a demon.

Really, it's just a parasitic entity
in a non-corporeal transference.

Why? Because they can't stomach

he broke the boy's arm.

Does Cameron have any history
of schizophrenia, delusion?

- Any meds I should know about?
- No. Nothing in his records.

283
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:03,896
The mother heard him scream in the kitchen.
And when she arrived...

284
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:06,230
she found this.

285
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,026
CAMILLA: The boy broke her neck.

286
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:15,331
Of course, we sent in the best exorcists
to handle the situation, but...

- How does it transfer?
- Physical contact.

00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:26,088
Judging from its trail of victims,
it can only possess the weak,

I haven't told the mother
about your connection with Maggie.

292
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:36,985
- Is the boy quarantined?
- No one has touched Cameron in a week.

- How's the mother's will?
- She's tired.

00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:43,000
She's been through a lot.
We're keeping her away from the boy.

- Another priest. Great.

299
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:02,302
No, he's not a priest. He's like a therapist.

I'm not here to treat your son
for mental illness.

301
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,185
- Then why are you here?
- I'm here to evaluate whether or not...

302
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:12,688
Dr. Ember has employed a cutting-edge
method for helping his patients.

303
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:17,026
He can go places we can't, get information
that'd otherwise be unavailable to us.

304
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:20,347

- Let's get this straight off the bat.

305
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:24,400
I don't do exorcisms. I don't use
religious methods to treat the symptoms.

306
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,664
I go inside the victim's mind
to treat the disease.

307
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:32,908
I don't compel these entities
from the outside. I evict them...

308
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:35,845
- from the inside.
- You evict them?

309
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:41,584
The entity that is holding your son
has no real power. It's a parasite.

your son is asleep,

it has to convince him his dream is real.

Yes.

It rifles through his mind

into the nearest living host.
