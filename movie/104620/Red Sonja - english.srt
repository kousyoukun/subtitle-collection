1
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,236
<i>Sonja.</i>

2
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,121
<i>You are suffering, Sonja...</i>

3
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,995
<i>but vengeance shall be yours.</i>

4
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,800
<i>Vengeance on Queen Gedren...</i>

5
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,062
<i>who wanted you for herself.</i>

6
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,707
<i>Your disgust was clear.</i>

7
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:58,511
<i>And so it was that Gedren</i>
<i>ordered your family murdered...</i>

8
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,390
<i>your body violated by her soldiers.</i>

9
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,557
<i>But in your quest</i>
<i>for justice and vengeance...</i>

10
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,129
<i>you will need great strength...</i>

11
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,468
<i>for your sword arm must have no equal.</i>

12
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,105
<i>L give you that strength.</i>

13
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,616
Varna, where is the Lord of Hyrkania?

14
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,144
He has not come, Highness.

15
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,550
He should be here
for the destruction of the talisman.

16
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,720
But we cannot delay.
We will proceed without him.

17
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,084
O God of the high Gods...

18
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:04,322
behold the talisman with which
you created the world and all things.

19
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,064
O God of Gods...

20
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,535
it has become too powerful for us...

21
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,111
and we must destroy it
before it destroys the world.

22
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,126
Forgive us now
as we send it out of the light...

23
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,534
from which it draws its power...

24
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,907
into eternal darkness.

25
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,520
Forgive us.

26
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,214
Come on.

27
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,201
So this can make worlds...

28
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,579
or shatter them by storm and earthquake.

29
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,047
Have it lifted out.

30
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,519
Lift it out!

31
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,416
Touch it.

32
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,077
So it is true. Only women may touch it.

33
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,850
The cover.

34
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,895
Take it out.

35
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,910
Great queen,
what shall we do with the prisoners?

36
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,790
- No!
- No!

37
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,578
Come.

38
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,171
Horses.

39
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,933
The talisman's stolen.

40
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,836
Must destroy the talisman.

41
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,069
We must find my sister. Take me.

42
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,443
L know where she is. Please.

43
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,950
Magnificent.

44
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,697
You have nothing more to learn, Sonja.

45
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,337
You are the master of the master.

46
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,735
Never have l seen your equal.

47
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,751
You must learn to like men a little better.

48
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,693
They are not all evil.

49
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,527
We must judge by our own experience,
Grand Master.

50
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,760
L know.

51
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,736
But in life, all is not swordplay.

52
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,740
Hatred of men in a lovely young woman...

53
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,104
it could be your downfall.

54
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,374
L don't hate all men, Grand Master.

55
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,187
That would have been music to my ears
30 years ago.

56
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,050
Come.

57
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:12,192
A great swordsman
must have a great sword.

58
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,372
Choose.

59
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,538
A gift from the Grand Master.

60
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,788
<i>Sonja.</i>

61
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,163
What is it, Red Sonja?

62
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,354
L'm looking for Red Sonja.

63
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,610
- I am Sonja.
- Your sister's dying.

64
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,181
L'll take you to her.

65
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,801
Varna.

66
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,882
Thank God.

67
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,653
L've lived long enough.

68
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,355
The talisman's stolen.

69
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,988
All the priests massacred.

70
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,258
- We fought...
- Rest, Varna. Later we can talk.

71
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,098
There's no time. Listen.

72
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,169
The talisman has terrible power...

73
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,400
which grows in the light.

74
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:19,345
In 13 days it could destroy the world...

75
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,312
by storm and earthquake.

76
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,524
You must destroy the talisman, Sonja.

77
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,599
Send it into darkness. Swear that you will.

78
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,300
L swear.

79
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,940
Who took it?

80
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,277
L don't know.

81
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,273
There was a woman with a gold mask.

82
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,546
Soldiers.

83
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,652
Where did they take it? North? South?

84
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,329
She's dead.
And the living have work to do.

85
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,975
Her work, my work, is no concern of yours.

86
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,078
- Who are you, anyway?
- My name is Kalidor.

87
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,351
L befriended your sister, remember?

88
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,683
L'm a friend of yours, too.

89
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,657
L thank you for what you did for my sister.
You will be rewarded.

90
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,588
L'm no mercenary. Nobody pays me.

91
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,392
If l think somebody owes me something,
l take it.

92
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,676
Someone is using the talisman.

93
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,744
- What place is that?
- Hablok. It's a great city.

94
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,120
Where are you going?

95
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,453
Hablok.

96
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,187
Wait. L'll come with you.

97
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:50,101
Why should you? It's no business of yours.

98
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,096
And neither am I.

99
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,502
You may be wrong on both counts.

100
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,231
L know you're a brave girl,
but danger is my trade.

101
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,571
Then l'll learn it by myself.

102
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,879
Don't make me angry, Kalidor.

103
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,714
L don't need any man's help.

104
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,740
Don't shake it, fool. Hold it steady!
Can you do nothing right?

105
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,114
Still, you great idiot.

106
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,009
L'm trying, Your Highness.

107
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,156
Clumsy oaf. Stupid, dumb,
useless, selfish beast!

108
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,382
Quickly, come. Come to me.

109
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:52,393
Don't give me orders, slave.
L'll have you hung by the heels.

110
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,724
Anyway, it's too slippery.

111
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,936
Do you want me to fall
in that boiling mud? You numskull.

112
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,368
L'll try to swing it around. Now.

113
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,141
- Hold still, boy.
- Boy?

114
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,382
Steady, Your Majesty. Steady.

115
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,461
Jump off. Jump.

116
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,469
What about me?

117
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,272
Get back here and stop playing the fool.

118
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,476
L hear and obey, master of the world.
L'm coming.

119
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,776
Lucky for you that this person came along.

120
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,041
Reward her, and tell her who l am.

121
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,180
His Royal Highness, the Prince Tarn,
Great Lord of Hablok...

122
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,591
keeper of the spotless throne...

123
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,186
great elephant who fertilizes the world
with his...

124
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,494
l've told you not to say that.

125
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,462
Do it again, and l'll have you impaled.

126
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,934
Well, reward her, fool.

127
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:57,085
From the look of your kingdom, Prince,
you need this more than l do.

128
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,655
Did she address me?

129
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,719
What happened?

130
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,693
Queen Gedren attacked us
is what happened.

131
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,702
Gedren? Queen Gedren?

132
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,570
That's right.

133
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,776
She knocked down half the city with her
new weapon and demanded our surrender.

134
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,470
My army ran away.

135
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,307
Do they want to live forever?

136
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,508
L refused to surrender.

137
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,575
So she knocked down the other half.

138
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,984
Falkon, since everyone is dead
or run away...

139
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,019
you shall escort me
to the mountains tomorrow.

140
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,028
L shall raise a new army...

141
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,497
and crush this upstart Gedren underfoot.

142
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,930
Where can l find her, this Queen Gedren?

143
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,899
In Burkubane, the land of eternal night.

144
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,304
How do l get there?

145
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:53,401
There's a long scenic way, and there's
the short way through Brytag's toll road.

146
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,572
L'll take Brytag's toll road.
Which way is that?

147
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,617
Straight north from here.
You can't miss it.

148
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,517
But it's worth a try.

149
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,424
Ask the woman
if she wishes to join my army.

150
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,087
We'll probably need a cook.

151
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,357
Your Highness is too kind,
but l travel alone.

152
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:19,568
Dismiss the woman, Falkon.
L shall dine in an hour.

153
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,042
May l give you a word of advice?

154
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,582
Put him over your knee
and beat some manners into him.

155
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,246
You wouldn't happen to have a tablecloth,
would you?

156
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,700
Brytag, come down and open the gate.

157
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,941
Not so fast, redhead.

158
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,814
L'm up here
where l can get a better look at you.

159
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,215
L have no time to waste, Brytag.

160
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,787
L have plenty. Come up, l say.

161
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,435
- Come here, wench.
- Why should I?

162
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,341
Because l am Brytag. This is my land.

163
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,973
All that pass through pay me tribute.

164
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,745
- How much, Brytag?
- Who mentioned money?

165
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,245
Tribute, l said.

166
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,447
The tender kind all women pay to Brytag.

167
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,859
Suppose l don't.

168
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:09,104
Suppose, instead, l open up
that great fat belly of yours.

169
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,035
You hear that?

170
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,948
She's going to open up my great...

171
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,913
Woman, l have fought 177 men.

172
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,158
Only one survives, and he has got no legs.

173
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,822
You dare to mock at Brytag?

174
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,492
That takes no daring.

175
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,126
But when l've killed you,
will your warriors let me go unharmed?

176
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,733
When you've killed me?

177
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:49,370
When this wench has killed me,
you will let her go unharmed, won't you?

178
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:50,872
Aye.

179
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,712
See?

180
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,690
So, wench.

181
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,158
L'm gonna feed your eyes
to the birds, red hair.

182
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,301
L don't need eyes to find you.

183
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,861
L can smell you at a hundred paces.

184
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,152
L will tell the future in your entrails,
red woman.

185
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,360
L know my future. You have none.

186
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,203
Hold on, Sonja.

187
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,614
Sonja, come on.

188
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,305
Look out!

189
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,562
This way. Follow me!

190
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,868
- Get away. Go!
- What about you?

191
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,700
L can hold them. Go!

192
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,206
Hurry! Stop them!

193
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,776
Release me, ruffian!

194
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,676
Release me, l say!

195
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,880
- Tell us where it is.
- L'll have your head for this!

196
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,421
Don't be shy.

197
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,257
The gold, boy. Where's the gold?

198
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,986
There is no gold, ruffian.

199
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,030
L tell you, l have no gold!

200
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,641
You have fine raiment, boy,
almost as resplendent as mine.

201
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,043
And you expect me to believe
you're penniless?

202
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:20,346
L'll have you know, villain,
l am Prince Tarn of Hablok.

203
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:24,210
My subjects will see
to your punishment for this.

204
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,885
And a grievous punishment it will be,
impertinent oaf!

205
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,617
Your subjects?

206
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,259
My kingdom is greater than yours.

207
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,299
And l have but four.

208
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,731
Pull him!

209
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,165
- Are you all right, your sovereign Majesty?
- Yes, clumsy oaf.

210
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,040
Why did you leave him?

211
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,512
We needed food. L went hunting.

212
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,707
You could have taken him with you.

213
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,808
Tell her, Falkon,
that l don't care for hunting.

214
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,014
He doesn't care for hunting.

215
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,415
Treasure to the vaults,
prisoners to the dungeons.

216
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,124
Take the talisman back
to the Chamber of Lights.

217
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,956
Very well, my queen.

218
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,979
Perhaps fewer candles...

219
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,654
would be advisable, Your Majesty.

220
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,216
Why?

221
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,862
The stronger the light, the greater
the power of the talisman grows.

222
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,023
L want more light here, not less.

223
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,796
But it is dangerously powerful already,
great queen.

224
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:36,238
- Look what it did to Hablok.
- Yes. Very satisfying.

225
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,935
But l want its full power
when we march against Toktyl, Ikol.

226
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,444
Its full power.

227
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,744
- It will be beyond our control, Majesty.
- Majesty!

228
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,546
Enemies are approaching
the outer empire.

229
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,243
It's the Prince of Hablok, Your Majesty...

230
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,255
with his army.

231
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,617
Insects.

232
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,592
That girl.

233
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,567
So she escaped the fire. How fortunate.

234
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:51,399
Ikol, l want her alive
without so much as a scratch on her skin.

235
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,670
Shall l send out a small ambush party?

236
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,071
No.

237
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,914
We'll wait till they get a little closer.

238
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:22,465
Burkubane, the land of perpetual night.

239
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,598
Falkon, proclaim my arrival...

240
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,268
and the defiance of Queen Gedren.

241
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,341
Sound your trumpet.

242
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,610
Keep quiet...

243
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,777
at least till we find a way across.

244
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:39,789
Princes do not sneak in
on their enemies like thieves.

245
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,222
You don't know
much about princes, do you?

246
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,486
You wait here with the horses.

247
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,726
L want to test this bridge first.

248
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,991
Or whatever it is.

249
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,469
It looks safe enough.
We'll lead the horses across.

250
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,602
Now hear me, Gedren!

251
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,375
It is I, Prince Tarn of Hablok...

252
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:15,077
to revenge myself
on the tyrant of Burkubane.

253
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,111
Be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.

254
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,720
How dare you, woman?

255
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,726
L'll show you how l dare.

256
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,319
This should have been done long ago.

257
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,031
No. If you must hit someone, then hit me.

258
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,298
You're not worth the effort, boy.

259
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,465
Boy?

260
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,339
Yes, boy. You'll never be anything else...

261
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:44,006
till you learn gratitude
and self-sacrifice, like Falkon.

262
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,841
He's a real man.

263
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:57,521
She didn't mean it, my prince.
She doesn't know your fine qualities.

264
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,108
Take that, ruffian.

265
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,995
Take that, you ruffian.

266
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:50,009
Practicing, Highness?

267
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,909
L thought princes did everything so well,
they wouldn't need to.

268
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,148
L was disarmed by those ruffians
the other day.

269
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:00,349
L noticed. So? It needn't be fatal.

270
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,089
L am disarmed. Kill me. Come on.

271
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,255
Come on!

272
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,635
You're meant to be
using your sword. Remember?

273
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,942
Simple, isn't it?

274
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,646
But it's not in the rule book.

275
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,984
You see, fencing and fighting
are two different things.

276
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,650
You need to learn them both.

277
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:50,130
Will you teach me to fence and to fight?

278
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,266
If you please?

279
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,811
Spoken like a prince.

280
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:07,883
You were disarmed
because you hold the hilt too tight.

281
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,093
Grip gently. See?

282
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,263
Gently. L see. Like this?

283
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,960
Your Highness learns fast.

284
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:24,432
L think we'll continue
your fencing lessons another time.

285
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,606
We've an early start.

286
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,942
You are very beautiful.

287
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,574
When l am king of Hablok,
l shall have you at my court.

288
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,816
You will? My, the honor.

289
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,452
L may even make you my queen.

290
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,018
But l'm still young.

291
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,358
We shall have to see.

292
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,289
They will reach
the Ithian Cavern tomorrow.

293
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,163
We must force them to take shelter there.

294
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,530
The killing machine will do the rest.

295
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:30,038
Yes. They'll make fine fish food.

296
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,303
But not the girl.

297
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:37,307
L want that beauty here with me.
See to it that she is spared.

298
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,582
L'll do my best, my queen.

299
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,145
The machine is difficult to control.

300
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,714
One cannot guarantee
that something will not go wrong.

301
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,826
If it does, you will be its next victim.

302
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:09,944
The talisman, Ikol. We need a storm.

303
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,880
A little one.

304
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,862
We should be out in the storm.

305
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,889
Why? This is shelter, isn't it?

306
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:34,131
L haven't got time to shelter.
L've four days left to find the talisman.

307
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,201
Besides, something drove us in here...

308
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,340
every bit of the way.

309
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,307
L noticed it, but l'm not complaining.

310
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,085
Where's Tarn?

311
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,886
He promised not to wander.
Dry off, l'll go find him.

312
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,554
Look at this.

313
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,797
It must be the biggest in the world.

314
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,306
Could be fake.
There's a lot of bad stuff around.

315
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,944
This pearl can rebuild Hablok...

316
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,148
fill its treasury, buy me an army.

317
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,355
Dig it out!

318
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,326
Your Highness,
it may belong to somebody.

319
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,362
It does, and he wants it now!

320
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:36,892
Yeah.

321
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,440
Use your dagger, fool!

322
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,029
What are you doing?

323
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,828
Falkon, Highness, look at the water!

324
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,769
Come on. Put your back into it.

325
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:18,469
It won't budge.
Maybe it wasn't meant to come out.

326
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,835
The water is rising.
You must get out of here.

327
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,483
- This way! Make for the stairs!
- Come, my prince!

328
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,917
- Get out of the water!
- Yes.

329
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,254
Climb up here, my prince.

330
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,789
Tarn!

331
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,064
L'm coming, my prince!

332
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,305
Let go!

333
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,808
Where is she?

334
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,109
L can't kill it! It's a machine!

335
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,823
Sonja, we have to blind it!

336
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,829
It's our only chance!

337
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,958
Falkon, get out! It can't see!

338
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,507
There. Keep it covered.

339
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,477
Why have you been following me?

340
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:07,022
To see that you reach the talisman safely.

341
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,250
Why?

342
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,754
L have to be sure
that the talisman is destroyed.

343
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,853
Centuries ago, the high lords of Arcadia...

344
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,866
had entrusted the talisman
to the priestesses...

345
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,300
because only women may touch it.

346
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,697
But to guard it,
or to destroy it if need be...

347
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,765
is still the duty of the High Lord.

348
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,002
You? The High Lord?

349
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,146
L was coming to the temple
to see the talisman destroyed...

350
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,515
when l found your sister dying...

351
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,214
and learnt that the talisman
had been stolen.

352
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,688
So she guided me to you.

353
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:44,283
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

354
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,355
You didn't seem to want a man's help.

355
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,525
But you needed it,
so that's why l followed you.

356
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,968
L had to be sure you reached the talisman.

357
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,965
L see.

358
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,238
L misunderstood.
L thought you had another reason.

359
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,279
L did.

360
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:23,129
No. L'm under a vow.

361
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:29,933
No man may have me
unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.

362
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:39,408
So the only man that can have you
is one who has tried to kill you.

363
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,185
That's logic.

364
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:15,349
If you yield only to a conqueror,
then prepare to be conquered.

365
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,460
Don't be a fool. L don't want to kill you.

366
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,294
Try it.

367
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,905
Come on.

368
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:54,083
Keep it down over there.
We're trying to sleep.

369
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,272
Are you all right?

370
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,504
Yes, Prince. We were just practicing.

371
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,244
Then let me down!

372
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,957
Thank you.

373
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,303
Why does she fight so hard?

374
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,881
She doesn't want to win.

375
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,682
Gedren's army.
Another kingdom enslaved.

376
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,648
The talisman! We must find a way in.

377
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,126
We'll have to climb.

378
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,460
Three of us should go in.

379
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:39,167
Who'll stand guard this doorway,
the post of danger?

380
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,101
- Falkon?
- Me? Here?

381
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:45,113
L don't know what's coming out that door.
No, l am going up.

382
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,375
Coward!

383
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,912
L'll take my chances in there.

384
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,115
And l have to go in.

385
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,263
L'll stay.

386
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,432
Take care, Your Highness.

387
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,324
Thank you.

388
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,769
Tomorrow, l start my diet.

389
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:04,314
Majesty, the talisman
is almost beyond control.

390
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,947
We must bury it in the dark
before it is too late!

391
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,823
It'll be buried when l have no further use
for it, and that time is not yet.

392
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:14,795
But it will kill us all!
O God, Majesty, what do you want?

393
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:18,624
Our vaults are brimming with gold.
Great states live in terror of us!

394
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,295
- What more is there?
- The world, Ikol!

395
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,801
Today we took another piece
of the city of Toktyl.

396
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,571
But l have wider claims
and the talisman will enforce them!

397
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,239
Madness. There will be no world.

398
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,011
There will be no world.

399
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,613
We must find the talisman.
Only l can touch it, remember.

400
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:45,215
You take that way, l'll go the other way.
Falkon, you take the center.

401
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,758
How's the food around here?

402
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,167
Who are you?

403
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:11,296
- Look for the talisman.
- Yeah. Right.

404
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,530
- Ikol, Gedren's black spider.
- You.

405
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:38,123
Yes. Prince Tarn of Hablok:

406
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,533
The city you blasted
with your filthy sorcery.

407
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:48,409
So the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.

408
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,008
Out of my way, child.

409
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:55,041
So that you can desert,
like the thief you are?

410
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,044
With my gold?

411
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,377
Hablok's gold?

412
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:10,023
Now that was unmannerly
of Your Highness...

413
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:14,125
and rude little boys need correction...

414
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,633
if they're going to grow up into...

415
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:29,614
l'm afraid Your Highness' growth
is going to be stunted permanently.

416
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,990
Now, yield, Black Spider.

417
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,272
Where's Queen Gedren?

418
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,211
She's gone. L'm so glad that you've come.

419
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:36,842
Please, will you protect me?
L'm so frightened.

420
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,399
Gedren! Where are you?

421
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:59,734
So the Prince of Hablok
honors us with his presence unwisely.

422
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:04,569
How many are with you?
Tell me! How many are with you?

423
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:08,214
- How many?
- Enough, Gedren!

424
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:16,015
Get back, or Hablok will need
an heir to the throne.

425
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,116
And your own throne, Gedren.

426
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:22,152
Unless the talisman goes into the dark,
your whole kingdom will...

427
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,866
Prince, get Kalidor and Falkon.

428
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,671
There's a way behind the throne.

429
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,573
The talisman, Gedren. Quickly!

430
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:41,175
You are a fool.
We could have ruled the world together.

431
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:45,812
Now l shall rule alone,
and you will die for what you did to me.

432
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,321
What l did?

433
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,657
You slaughtered my parents like cattle.

434
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:53,286
My brother, my sister!

435
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,259
Vermin! What were their lives
compared to this?

436
01:13:57,366 --> 01:14:00,893
You are mad!
The talisman will destroy you.

437
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,924
Up here, Sonja.

438
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:05,128
Up here.

439
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:22,269
Kalidor, Falkon, this way! Hurry!

440
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,757
Down this hallway!

441
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,574
Sonja. Over here.

442
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,352
Falkon, help.

443
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,569
Prince Tarn, come back.

444
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:42,208
L am here, Gedren. Death to all tyrants.

445
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,609
Sonja, help me!

446
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,381
L'm trapped!

447
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:22,246
Sonja! Behind you!

448
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,560
L can't get through.

449
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:43,371
Falkon, pull her through. L'll hold the gate.

450
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:48,366
Follow me. This is the way out.

451
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,168
How do you know, Highness?

452
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,941
Because this is the way
l came in, you clown.

453
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,657
Here's the way through.

454
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,127
Go. Quickly!

455
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:40,685
The door doesn't move.

456
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:42,017
How does it open?

457
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,990
L know. Leave it to me.

458
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:46,791
No! Come back, Prince!

459
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,407
He's done it.

460
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,933
We can't leave him.
Wait here, my prince. Don't go away.

461
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,617
Save yourselves! Run for it!

462
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,381
You, too, Falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!

463
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,781
Run! Run for it!

464
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:18,587
L'm not leaving here without you,
my prince.

465
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:24,154
Give me your hand. Reach. L'll get you out.

466
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,600
Hablok is over there.

467
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,774
When it's rebuilt,
you must come to visit us.

468
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:42,408
L'm sure to need a queen someday.

469
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,069
You'll find one.

470
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:47,475
Whoever she is, Prince, choose carefully.

471
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:52,645
L make it a rule never to take a woman
unless she can beat me in a fair fight.

472
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:56,349
That's a challenge
l might think about someday.

473
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,922
What about right now?

474
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,428
Why not?

475
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:40,262
Come along, Falkon.

476
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:42,069
Come on.

477
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,001
English
