00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:22,424
NARRATOR: This land has a name today
and is marked on maps.

2
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:27,512
But the names and the marks and the land
all had to be won.

3
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,140
Won from nature and from primitive man.

4
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:37,438
Five generations ago,
a mere 125 years back...

5
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:40,649
...this land was known
only as the West.

6
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:44,194
Known only to a handful of white men...

7
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:49,116
...lomely trappers wandering its vastness
in search of beaver.

8
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:52,369
They were known as mountain men,
a mew breed.

9
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:57,456
Men like Jim Bridger,
Franchère and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.

10
00:03:57,624 --> 00:04:01,043
More Indian than the Indians
in all but blood.

11
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,171
They held to no law but their own...

12
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:09,926
...drifted free as the clouds,
settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.

13
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:15,932
Their moccasined feet and unshod horses
leaving no trace on the land.

14
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,145
Like the Indians,
with whom they were at peace...

15
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:24,815
...they wanted nothing beyond
what they found, and little of that.

16
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:29,486
The mountains, the forests,
the harsh country...

17
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:33,157
...were as unchanging to them
as the stars...

18
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:36,035
...and just as unyielding.

19
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:41,748
Far behind the mountains,
beyond the rolling plains...

20
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:47,629
...they had left the people of the East,
people who were restless in another way.

21
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,674
The kind who'd look at a mountain
and see a watershed...

22
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:54,135
...look at a forest
and see lumber for houses...

23
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:57,012
...look at a stony field and see a farm.

24
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,266
Their faces and their instincts
had been turned to the West...

25
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,519
...ever since Plymouth Rock
and Jamestown.

26
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:08,774
The trapper's road was the trail
of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.

27
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,443
But for whole families
chaffing to follow the sun...

28
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,154
...there had to be broader ways.

29
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:19,867
There were no roads into the wilderness,
only rivers.

30
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:23,079
And they flowed in the wrong direction:
north or south.

31
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:26,373
Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.

32
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:33,296
Until one day, a mew river took source
in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.

33
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:36,883
He conceived of a river
that would go west.

34
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:42,388
And in the way Americans have
of acting out their dreams, it came to be.

35
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:45,224
The Erie Canal left the Hudson
above Albany...

36
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:48,852
...and carried clear across
to the Great Lakes.

37
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,398
People who yearned for virgin land
and a mew life...

38
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,899
...now had a highway to take them.

39
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,651
And they moved along.

40
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,404
MAN:
Pride of Utica now loading!

41
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:03,783
Al aboard for the Pride of Utica!

42
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,578
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...

43
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:10,122
...the Skoga family!

44
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,290
All eight of then!

45
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:17,004
Al aboard for the Pride of Utica!

46
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:21,299
Is the laddie's health
the reason you're heading west?

47
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:22,592
Partly.

48
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,761
Only partly.
Mostly our trouble East was rocks.

49
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:29,432
I had me a farm where some years I'd
raise 100 bushels of rocks to the acre.

50
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,101
Zebulon, you hadn't
ought to lie to the nan like that.

51
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:35,855
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul,
and I tell the truth as I see it.

52
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:39,442
Now, I never used a plow.
I'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.

53
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:42,527
And then one morning,
I hauled the bucket up out of the well...

54
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:45,572
...and so help me,
the bucket was full of rocks.

55
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,781
Rocks.

56
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,076
I just stood there right still
trying not to blaspheme.

57
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:52,662
I said to myself,
"You've got a son that's ailing...

58
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,414
...you've got a daughter
what won't take to herself a husband."

59
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,791
There she sits there, mooning as usual.
Pa.

60
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,794
You've got another who don't seem
quite right in the head.

61
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,963
Lilith?

62
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,633
LILITH:
Yes. Pa?

63
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,678
Now, I'll remind you. sir.

64
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:13,806
I'm still standing there
holding a bucket full of rocks...

65
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:16,851
...and staring into a bleak old age.

66
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,395
So I made me a vow
right then and there. I said:

67
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:23,816
"If I can find a man with $500
who likes rocks...

68
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:26,651
...then there's gonna be another fool
owning this farm."

69
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,489
Well, sir, the Lord provided such a nan...

70
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:31,865
...and here I an.

71
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:34,826
He ain't told you one word of truth,
Mr. Harvey.

72
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:36,787
We had the best farm in the township.

73
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:39,331
Yeah. Rockville Township it was.
Stone County.

74
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:40,998
Oh, it was not.

75
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,834
It was his itching foot
that brought us here.

76
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:46,295
Heaven knows where we'll end up.

77
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:50,841
Oh, these are my laddies.
Angus, Brutus and Colin.

78
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,176
How do you do?
Hello.

79
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:56,054
I think they're already acquainted
with your daughters.

80
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:59,682
Be they single?
Aye, single so far.

81
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,144
Well, this Illinois country's beginning
to sound better to me.

82
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:04,354
Lilith?

83
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:07,816
Lilith, here. Strike up a little tune
for these handsome lads.

84
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:11,110
Oh, I ain't in no mood, Pa.
Lilith, there's a time for coaxing...

85
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:12,986
...this ain't the time.

86
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:18,867
All right.

87
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:25,164
(SINGING) A captain bold in Halifax
Who lived in country quarters

88
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:29,001
Betrayed a maid who hanged herself
One morning in her garters...

89
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,461
ZEBULON:
Lilith.

90
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:33,381
Now, you know better
than to sing a song like that.

91
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,883
What ones do you know?
We know "Yankee Doodle."

92
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,844
"Yankee Doodle"?
Their mother's dead.

93
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:41,054
They haven't had much learning
in the social graces.

94
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:43,682
All right. give then
"A Home in the Meadow."

95
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,268
(SINGING "A HOME
IN THE MEADOW")

96
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,897
Eve. come on, you too.

97
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,108
That's it.

98
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,734
Come on. join in.

99
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,069
(ALL SINGING)

100
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,029
That's it.

101
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,828
Come on.

102
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,750
Stop.

103
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,474
Loading for the Flying Arrow!

104
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:33,604
All aboard for the Flying Arrow!

105
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:37,149
The Prescott family!
Here we be. Come on.

106
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:41,277
Alec Harvey and three sons!

107
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:44,906
Jeffrey Rose and family!

108
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:19,772
But the canal was only the first step
toward the promised land.

109
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,150
The next steps were longer and harder.

110
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:28,154
Those who could raise the fare
went by steamboat to the end of the lime.

111
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:31,783
Others found a cheaper way
to head for Ohio, Illinois...

112
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,244
...and the open spaces beyond.

113
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:41,041
(HUMMING)

114
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,679
Lilith. Lilith. listen to this:

115
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:57,306
"Theirs was a poignant parting
in the forest."

116
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:01,852
The handsome young backwoodsman
carved two hearts on a tree trunk...

117
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,399
"...then from ten paces, hurled a knife
at the junction of the two hearts."

118
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,150
Junction. What's that?

119
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:12,237
Well, that's where the two hearts meet.
Now, listen:

120
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,823
"His marksmanship was uncanny."

121
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:17,701
Three times he hurled
the knife on target.

122
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,844
'That was for luck.' he
said the first time.

123
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:24,582
'That was for love. Deep, divine love.'
he said the second.

124
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:30,713
And the third time, 'That was a prayer,
a plea for love undying."'

125
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,548
Isn't that beautiful?

126
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,385
I reckon. If anybody ever talks like that.

127
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:39,722
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.

128
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,223
There ain't no sense to you. Eve.

129
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:46,102
You wanna to be a farm wife,
but you don't wanna marry a farmer.

130
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,313
Neither do you.

131
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,522
Of course not.

132
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,108
I don't wanna have
nothing to do with farms.

133
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:57,279
I want silk dresses and fine carriages
and a man to smell good.

134
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:00,282
What I want's back East, not West.

135
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,743
But I'll get there yet. You watch.

136
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:05,912
You don't know what you want yet.

137
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:09,249
It's the nan that counts.
not where he lives.

138
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:19,842
Ready, now?
MAN: Ready.

139
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:59,504
Daddy, Daddy, something coming upriver.
Hostile Indians, I suspect.

140
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,276
Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?
Don't know.

141
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,820
They say no honest nan
travels this river at night.

142
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:27,738
I can only see one man, Pa.

143
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:31,117
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick.
They hide in the bottom of the boat...

144
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:32,910
...till they're ready to jump you.

145
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,080
Get my gun, Colin.
All right, Pa.

146
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:45,338
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.

147
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,342
And keep your hands
where we can see them.

148
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,360
Name's Linus Rawlings.

149
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:11,195
I'm hungrier than sin
and real peaceful like.

150
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:13,531
What have you got in the craft?
Beaver pelts.

151
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,200
I said beaver pelts.

152
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:20,329
I never had a chance to see a beaver pelt,
Mr. Rawlings.

153
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:24,417
Well, in that case, ma'am,
I'll show you one.

154
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:26,418
There you are.

155

That's real soft.

ZEBULON:
Now, my apologies, sir.

158
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:36,219
We was afeared you might be a pirate.
I ain't no pirate.

159
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:39,431
Come on. let's have supper
and get acquainted.

160
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:44,226
No, no, no. That's yours.
Keep that. ma'am.

161

Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.

00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:03,036
Is he the backwoodsman
you've been waiting for?

163
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:07,081
More than likely he's got
a wife and six kids waiting for him.

Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.

00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:38,152
You've only had four plates. I was
beginning to think you didn't like it.

167
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,447
Well, it don't pay to eat too much
on an empty stomach. ma'am.

How come you're to be traveling
so late at night?

169
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,285
Well, I'm kind of anxious
to get to Pittsburgh.

170

I ain't seen a city for a long time.
I aim to whoop it up a little.

Well, now. we've never seen
a mountain man before.

00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,254
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains
as high as they say?

174
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:03,425
Well, now. I just don't rightly know.
I never climbed one. I've...

Well, you know,
that just ain't exactly true.

Jin Bridger and me...

178
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:16,980
...we started up one of them little-bitty
Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.

179
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:21,276
And then. one day. we see this fella...

180
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:25,737
...and he has a great big pair
of white wings...

181
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:27,573
...and a harp in his hand.

182
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:30,284
And I said to Jim...

183
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:34,246
...I said, "Jin, I don't like the way
that fella's looking at us."

184
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:38,584
And Jim said he didn't care too much
for it neither...

185
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,835
...so we both skedaddled down
out of there...

186
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:45,006
...and to this day I ain't never had
a good look at the Rocky Mountains.

Well, then. I reckon it's about bedtime.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.

We'll be expecting you for breakfast.

Good night.

Strange fellas, these mountain men.
Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.

By golly. that looks like my blanket.
It is.

Well, then. I'm a mite confused, ma'am.
Whose bed would it be?

Yours.

201
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:55,488
I ain't ever saw a bed like that
since last time I come east.

Why'd you do it?

203
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:01,118
Ain't polite to ask a girl
why she dome something for a nan.

204
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:04,413
No. Well, I reckon my manners
ain't much at that.

Anyway, I sure thank you.
Good night, ma'am.

Are them Indian girls pretty?

207
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:18,802
Well, now. I reckon that all depends
on just how long a nan has gone...

208
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:21,054
...without seeing one.

209

since you seen a white girl?

210

I ain't quite sure why you asked that.

How pretty do I look to you?

to get these questions answered.

you've been kissed before.

I've never been kissed permanent before.

221

By golly, you sure use surprising words.

222
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:26,781
I never heard "permanent" mixed up
with a thing like a kiss before.

223
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,910
I can still feel that kiss.

Well, you said something before...

229
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:49,720
Eve. I'm a sinful man.

Deep, dark, sinful.

00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:56,684
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh
to be sinful again.

232
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:58,644
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.

233
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:01,522
I won't even remember
the fancy gals I dally with...

...or the men I carve up
just out of pure cussedness...

...any more than I'll remember you.

Can you still feel that kiss?

Eve...

238
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:21,082
Eve. you make me feel like a man
standing on a narrow ledge...

239
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,336
...coning face-to-face with a grizzly bear.

242
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:01,245
Eve! Where is she?
Zeb, what's the matter?

243
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:04,414
Anyways, you're here.
I thought you'd gone with him.

244
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:07,584
Gone?
Yes, gone.

245
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,919
I knowed you were setting with him...

246
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:13,089
...but I kept telling myself,
"At least she's looking at a nan."

247
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:17,009
Even a wisp of smoke like that
is better than...

248
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:22,431
Are you crying? Crying for him?
Now, what does that mean?

249
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,642
Now, tell me what that means.

250
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,270
Nothing, Pa.

251
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:30,605
What time did you come to bed?

252
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,108
It was early. Pa.

253
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:36,152
It wasn't. It was late.

254
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,947
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.

255
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:42,533
Is there anything for your ma and pa
to worry about?

256
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,202
No, Pa, there ain't.

257
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,678
He'll be back.

258
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:05,722
I'll see him again.

259
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,642
But you expected to see him this morning.
You know you did.

260
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,978
I don't care. I'll see him again.

261
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:15,063
Look.

262
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:26,616
You got a growed man to do that?
I did. Just like in the book.

263
00:22:26,783 --> 00:22:29,827
Did you get him to say then crazy words?

264
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:33,122
I told you before, it ain't the words,
it's the sentiment.

265
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:37,668
You mean, he didn't even giggle nor nothing
at such foolishness?

266
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:41,963
He said it was a real solemn occasion.

267
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,799
Like shooting the rapids without a paddle.

268
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:50,639
No matter what he said, he did it just
to get rid of you so as he could clear out.

269
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:52,933
You know that's so.

270
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,936
And you're lucky he did. Do you wanna
live like a squaw all your life?

271
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:59,563
Go on, say anything you like...

272
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:02,650
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.

273
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:05,110
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.

274
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:08,489
He ain't got a wife at all yet.

275
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:23,336
Hey, Pierre!

276
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:24,836
Someone's coming upriver.

00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:40,935
Customer.

278
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,404
Trapper, seems like.

279
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:55,448
See how that cover bellies up?
Could be furs.

280
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,837
Thirsty, mister?

281
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:12,548
Drier than a grasshopper on a hot griddle.

282

Well, welcome to our little inn, sir.

285
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:24,435
Pittsburgh? Well.

a whole canoe of furs. Pop.

287
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,522
Sure enough mountain nan.
Indeed.

Well, nothing but the finest for you, sir.
Whiskey?

290
00:24:35,946 --> 00:24:38,531
Right.
No pepper or rattlesnake heads in this.

291
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:41,116
Nothing but the pure grain
and the sweet kiss of the malt.

292
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:43,594
Never mind the cup,
I'll just take the jug.

293
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,151
Oh, a real mountain man, huh?

294
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:50,125
I trust you'll toast our noble banner, sir.
Sure will.

295
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:13,146
Golly, you're right.
That's real sipping liquor.

296
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:17,025
Pa, him being a trapper, you suppose he
might know what that varmint is we got?

297
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:19,819
Well, say, now, he night.
Yes. sir, he just night.

298
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:22,322
Sir. we caught us
a cave-dwelling critter...

299
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,574
...that no nan in these parts
has seen before.

300

You know, it'd be right satisfying
to having you tell us what it is.

301
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:32,164
Well, I don't know too much
about cave-dwelling varmints.

Just yonder. Take your jug.

00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:42,333

I lay you a hundred it's
no less than six.

462
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:54,441
How will you prove it?
Go backstage and find out.

463
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:58,067
If I go back and check with you.
Fair enough.

464
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,277
Second girl.

465
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:12,653
Miss Prescott? Miss Prescott?
later.

466
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:15,154
It's rather important.

467
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:16,905
It's always important.

468
00:46:17,073 --> 00:46:19,655
The older they are.
the more important it gets.

469
00:46:19,823 --> 00:46:22,406
Miss Prescott, please.
I an Hylan Seabury...

470
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:25,656
...attormey in the matter
of Jonathan Brooks.

471
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,823
He means nothing to you?

472
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:29,282
That old goat?

473
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,075
Well, you must've meant
something to him, Miss Prescott.

474
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:33,992
Why?
You're included in his will.

475
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,910
Of course, you have to make the trip
to California to claim the bequest.

476
00:46:38,077 --> 00:46:40,452
Well, now. I wouldn't go to California...

477
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,535
...if John Jacob Astor left me
San Francisco.

478
00:46:43,703 --> 00:46:46,286
I don't think Mr. Astor
had holdings there, no.

479
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:49,620
However, the yield from
Mr. Brooks' property is not to be scorned.

480
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:54,080
Yield of what?
Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.

481
00:46:54,247 --> 00:46:56,163
Gold?
Precisely.

482
00:46:56,331 --> 00:47:01,998
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.
It yielded $3500 the very first week.

483
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,290
LILITH:
Gold mine?

484
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:09,208
Well. Well, I...

485
00:47:09,376 --> 00:47:12,125
That sweet old goat.

486
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:17,418
For heavens...

487
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,630
Well.

488
00:47:30,798 --> 00:47:32,463
This is an unexpected pleasure.

489
00:47:32,631 --> 00:47:34,880
Where's the money?
Money?

490
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:36,131
Money?

491
00:47:36,298 --> 00:47:40,215
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course.
to our little agreement.

492
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:43,216
One hundred to start you off...

493
00:47:43,384 --> 00:47:45,175
...and my share of the winnings.

494
00:47:46,634 --> 00:47:51,259
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report
that the hundred no longer exists.

495
00:47:53,302 --> 00:47:55,177
That $100, I assure you...

496
00:47:55,345 --> 00:47:59,928
...will turn out to be the best investment
you have ever made.

497
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:02,012
I have plans, gentlemen...

498
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,970
...beyond your wildest dreams.

499
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:08,971
I'm gonna earn you
a piece of a gold mime.

500
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:11,430
Gold mine.

501
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:13,640
You ain't gonna earn nothing.

502
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,598
You ain't gonna be nothing.
you ain't gonna do nothing...

503
00:48:16,766 --> 00:48:19,015
...unless we get that 100 back
by the morning.

504
00:48:19,183 --> 00:48:21,474
Grimes, you don't mean that.

505
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:25,475
You're gonna kill off the golden goose.
Call it what you want. mister.

506
00:48:25,643 --> 00:48:27,559
We'll be waiting.

507
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:55,232
Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off
point for emigrants from everywhere.

508
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,817
Solid, God-fearing families
bound for the farmlands of Oregon...

509
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:05,151
...and get-rich-quick adventurers
racing for the gold of California.

510
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,485
Try it.

511
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:17,487
You got a wagon. I suppose?
I can get one.

512
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:18,904
And a team to pull it?

513
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:20,446
I can get everything I meed.

514
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,656
You got a husband?
I'm single. Mr. Morgan.

515
00:49:24,823 --> 00:49:27,115
No traveling companion?

516
00:49:27,282 --> 00:49:30,448
No, I'm traveling alone.
Not on my wagon train.

517
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:34,116
Alone and single brings out
the deviltry in a man.

518
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:37,617
Gets then all worked up
and they're wild enough already.

519
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:40,159
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.

520
00:49:41,327 --> 00:49:43,576
Oh, woman of your sort?

521
00:49:43,786 --> 00:49:45,883
One day you'd find
yourself in trouble, and

522
00:49:45,914 --> 00:49:48,566
there'd be hell to pay
just figuring out who.

523
00:49:48,703 --> 00:49:52,120
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?

524
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:57,162
Well, now. ain't you the feisty one.
I like spirit in a woman.

525
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,622
Hey, you got a pretty face
under that powder too.

526
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,581
And a fine, sturdy body
under then clothes, I wager.

527
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:10,666
There's a woman named Clegg.
Aggie Clegg.

528
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:12,874
Why don't you go see her?

529
00:50:20,794 --> 00:50:22,585
Thanks.

530
00:50:31,547 --> 00:50:33,629
I told you, no.

531
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,672
I was hoping to make this trip
with a husband.

532
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,256
Nearly got one last week.

533
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:42,424
Look. I hear there's 40 men
to every woman in California.

534
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,174
Miss Clegg. I'd be willing to pay you.
I don't meed money.

535
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:48,675
I meed a nan.

536
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:51,800
Any man.

537
00:50:58,511 --> 00:51:00,593
Morning, ladies.

538
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:03,261
Beautiful morning.

539
00:51:03,846 --> 00:51:07,720
Would you, by any chance.
happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?

540
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:10,471
Not unless you got a big imagination.

541
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,180
Then you must be the lady in question.

542
00:51:13,348 --> 00:51:15,764
Cleve Van Valen, Miss Prescott,
at your service.

543
00:51:15,932 --> 00:51:18,681
At your every command
from here to California.

544
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:20,056
Well, thank you.

545
00:51:20,224 --> 00:51:22,433
But whatever you're offering,
I don't meed.

546
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:23,599
(CHUCKLES)

547
00:51:23,767 --> 00:51:25,016
Perhaps you don't understand.

548
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:26,183
(LAUGHS)

549
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:29,434
Yes. I do.
I know a tin-horn when I see one.

550
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:31,017
Miss Prescott.

551
00:51:31,185 --> 00:51:34,226
I'm offering you an honest day's work
for an honest day's pay.

552
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:38,019
Goodbye, Mr. Van Valen. Goodbye.

553
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,728
Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you.
Miss Clegg.

554
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:47,396
May I say I have never seen a woman
with more beautiful hair.

555
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:49,688
What a prize catch it'll make...

556
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,647
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.

557
00:51:53,023 --> 00:51:57,690
Beauty alone in the wilderness,
and who's to protect you?

558
00:51:57,858 --> 00:51:58,940
No one.

559
00:51:59,108 --> 00:52:04,233
Not one person
won't be looking after himself.

560
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:07,609
Well...

561
00:52:09,569 --> 00:52:13,277
Good day. ladies. Good day.

562
00:52:17,112 --> 00:52:20,362
Nobody ever said that to me before.

563
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,320
What?

564
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:26,530
That I had such... Such beautiful hair.

565
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:31,531
You know something?

566
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:36,199
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men
like fish to the bait.

567
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:40,283
Maybe I can catch one of then
while they swim by.

568
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,492
You got yourself a partner.

569
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,076
Thank you.

570
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:48,618
MAN 1:
How's it, men?

571
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:50,974
MAN 2: It's all clear through here.
Look for

572
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:52,900
a little mud-hole up
through the next pocket.

573
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:55,036
MAN 1: How far?
MAN 2: Oh, maybe half a quarter.

574
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:56,117
MAN 1: Well, thanks.

575
00:52:56,148 --> 00:52:58,234
MAN 2: Looks a little
higher up on that ridge.

576
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:02,246
MAN 1: There's a water hole up there
about half a mile. Let's head for it.

577
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:12,291
MAN 3:
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

578
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:18,709
Hey, you're driving.

579
00:53:19,126 --> 00:53:21,959
I was raised on a farm.

580
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,835
MAN 3:
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

581
00:54:05,304 --> 00:54:06,470
Hey, Aggie?

582
00:54:08,054 --> 00:54:10,970
Can you use these?
AGGIE: Yeah. sure.

583
00:54:11,138 --> 00:54:12,971
Thanks.

584
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:27,224
Ladies.

585
00:54:36,602 --> 00:54:38,477
At your service.

586
00:54:38,644 --> 00:54:40,227
LILITH:
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.

587
00:54:40,395 --> 00:54:44,145
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of
you two making this trip without my help.

588
00:54:44,312 --> 00:54:48,187
If I was to hear later on that something
happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.

589
00:54:48,354 --> 00:54:49,812
You came 100 miles alone?

590
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:54,481
Well, I had no way of counting the miles.
Mr. Morgan. but I'll take your word for it.

591
00:54:54,648 --> 00:54:56,898
Well, you've got another 100, mister.
Going back.

592
00:54:57,065 --> 00:55:00,231
I told you, when a wagon breaks down,
I want men who can fix it...

593
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:02,149
...not bet how long it'll take.

594
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:03,982
You don't mean you'll turn me out?

595
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,733
Pass me adrift at the mercy
of savage Indians?

596
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:09,066
If you don't get moving.
I'll cast you adrift...

597
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:12,026
Uh-uh-uh.
I appeal to your sporting instinct, sir.

598
00:55:12,194 --> 00:55:15,485
I'm prepared to wager you
that I stay with this train.

599
00:55:15,652 --> 00:55:18,569
Well, you got a wager.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

600
00:55:18,737 --> 00:55:20,569
The fact is, I hired this man.

601
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:23,195
We'll put up his stake.

602
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,237
Is that right, Miss Prescott?

603
00:55:27,405 --> 00:55:29,946
If Miss Clegg says so.

604
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:42,325
Ma'am...

605
00:55:42,825 --> 00:55:44,575
...l'll be forever grateful.

606
00:55:48,327 --> 00:55:51,155
Now, I'll unpack my gear.

607
00:55:54,775 --> 00:55:57,440
Agatha, have you gone crazy?

608
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:00,607
He says he's a nan
wanting to do an honest day's work.

609
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,941
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.

610
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:08,899
Hey, you men on that last wagon,
keep up that slack.

611
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:10,856
Keep it up.

612
00:56:11,274 --> 00:56:14,691
Get that team moving.
Keep them moving there.

613
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:20,024
Don't let those limes sag.

614
00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:23,649
Keep them up. Keep them up.

615
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:29,816
Keep those teams moving.

616
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,691

known that I couldn't live without you.

the responsibilities of a faithful husband.

Oh, and are you ready to assume
the responsibilities...

...of my property too, Mr. Van Valen?

636
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:28,128
Really?

637
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:29,919
What kind of property?

638
00:58:31,044 --> 00:58:33,083
Gold, Mr. Van Valen.

639
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,330
Gold by the ton, from what I understand.

640

I found myself throwing in

No.

802

A married man should spend

Then we'll open a music hall

Have you seen San Francisco?

808
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:43,394
It's ugly, and it's small,
and it's full of fleas.

809
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:45,624
And it burns down
about every five minutes...

...but each time they keep on rebuilding it
a little bigger and better than before.

We could start out

With the help of the devil,
I'll bet we make it.

Young America was not only
a union of East and West.

There were North and South too.

Mr. Lincoln, now retired

824
01:19:58,048 --> 01:20:02,220
...to mold the mew and
uncommitted territories to its own image.

825
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:04,850
Still two years from the presidency...

826
01:20:05,019 --> 01:20:08,521
...he pleaded that the free West
be allowed to remain free...

...and warmed of the hazards
of a house divided against itself.

828
01:20:12,778 --> 01:20:16,742
But the South,
seeing its power and influence wane...

829
01:20:16,909 --> 01:20:21,539
...struggled against the inevitable

01:29:55,282 --> 01:29:58,866
Don't seen fitting a man should have
to do any of the things we've dome today.

933
01:29:59,034 --> 01:30:01,826
Did you kill anybody?

934
01:30:01,994 --> 01:30:04,161
I don't think so.

935
01:30:04,537 --> 01:30:07,204
I got knocked dizzy right off.

936
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:12,333
And when I come to, found my rifle,
it was busted.

937
01:30:13,585 --> 01:30:18,295
And then some more soldiers come along
and tried to stick me in the arm.

938
01:30:20,048 --> 01:30:22,840
All the rest is nixed up after that.

939
01:30:23,008 --> 01:30:27,176
Well, I ain't killed nobody, neither.
And I don't want to.

940
01:30:28,261 --> 01:30:31,637
Hey, where you from?
Ohio.

941
01:30:31,804 --> 01:30:35,598
This fool war started in the East.
What's us Westerners doing in it?

942
01:30:35,766 --> 01:30:38,975
I don't rightly know anymore.

943
01:30:43,228 --> 01:30:45,771
It ain't quite what I expected.

944
01:30:47,565 --> 01:30:52,567
There ain't much glory looking at a man
with his guts hanging out.

945
01:30:55,195 --> 01:30:58,029
Where are you from?
Texas.

946
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:01,114
Say...

947
01:31:01,449 --> 01:31:03,407
You ain't a Reb, are you?

948
01:31:03,575 --> 01:31:08,285
Well, I was this morning.
Tonight, I ain't so sure.

949
01:31:08,745 --> 01:31:12,580
Seems like I ought to be shooting you.

950
01:31:13,414 --> 01:31:16,666
Well, you got anything to shoot with?

951
01:31:18,418 --> 01:31:20,043
No.

952
01:31:20,211 --> 01:31:22,711
All I got's this bayonet.

953
01:31:23,213 --> 01:31:25,380
I got a pistol.

954
01:31:26,256 --> 01:31:29,299
I took it off a dead officer.

955
01:31:32,094 --> 01:31:35,053
Hey, why don't we
skedaddle out of here?

956
01:31:35,762 --> 01:31:37,846
You mean desert?
I mean. why don't...?

957
01:31:38,013 --> 01:31:41,598
Just leave this here war
to the folks who'd want it.

958
01:31:46,727 --> 01:31:50,729
They say there ain't no war
out in California.

959
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:54,648
MAN:
Get that battery over here.

960
01:31:57,026 --> 01:32:02,028
Stragglers, join your regiment.
Stragglers. Hey, you!

961
01:32:10,576 --> 01:32:13,910
I'm planning to move Rousseau's brigade
into this area.

962
01:32:14,578 --> 01:32:19,248
Hidden battery, placed well before dawn.
Do you approve?

963
01:32:19,415 --> 01:32:22,416
I'll approve any dispositions
you wanna make.

964
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:26,752
If you hadn't held the flank today,
we'd have been whipped for fair.

965
01:32:27,295 --> 01:32:31,672
Sherman. let's sit down a minute.
There's something I wanna say to you.

966
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:35,299
Lantern.

967
01:32:40,929 --> 01:32:43,096
GRANT:
You may find yourself in command here.

968
01:32:43,264 --> 01:32:44,346
SHERMAN:
Why?

969
01:32:44,973 --> 01:32:50,892
I've seen some of the dispatches the
newspaper correspondents have filed today.

970
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:54,186
They're saying
I was taken by surprise this morning.

971
01:32:54,354 --> 01:32:57,022
You weren't taken by surprise.

972
01:32:57,189 --> 01:32:58,439
I was.

973
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,357
GRANT:
No matter.

974
01:33:00,734 --> 01:33:01,858
They're saying...

975
01:33:03,651 --> 01:33:06,319
...I was drunk again last night.

976
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:10,697
SHERMAN:
Were you?

977
01:33:13,116 --> 01:33:14,616
No.

978
01:33:15,284 --> 01:33:18,243
But you can't fight front and rear.

979
01:33:18,411 --> 01:33:20,661
Win or lose, tomorrow...

980
01:33:21,621 --> 01:33:23,288
...I intend to resign.

981
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:27,666
SHERMAN:
Because of the newspapers?

982
01:33:29,668 --> 01:33:32,794
Because of a general
lack of confidence in me.

983
01:33:32,962 --> 01:33:36,088
Oh, don't you think
I've ever felt like that?

984
01:33:36,256 --> 01:33:39,840
A month ago they were saying
I was crazy. Insane.

985
01:33:40,008 --> 01:33:44,469
Now they're calling me a hero.
A hero or crazy, I'm the same man.

986
01:33:44,636 --> 01:33:47,012
It doesn't matter what the people think.

987
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,763
It's what you think, Grant.

988
01:33:51,891 --> 01:33:53,891
You mean that's Grant?

989
01:33:55,852 --> 01:33:57,310
I reckon.

990
01:33:57,478 --> 01:33:59,644
General Grant.

991
01:33:59,812 --> 01:34:03,355
You know this war's gonna be won
in the West, and how to win it.

992
01:34:03,523 --> 01:34:06,066
Everything you've dome proves it.

993
01:34:06,734 --> 01:34:11,944
And I say that a nan has the right
to resign only if he's wrong.

994
01:34:12,237 --> 01:34:14,237
Not if he's right.

995
01:34:15,822 --> 01:34:20,450
I guess I never thought of it that way.

996
01:34:21,367 --> 01:34:22,576
I'll think it over.

997
01:34:23,495 --> 01:34:24,994
SHERMAN:
What is there to think about?

998
01:34:25,162 --> 01:34:29,371
The Army's better off with you
than without you. That's the test.

999
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:34,751
All right.

1000
01:34:35,168 --> 01:34:36,335
Thanks.

1001
01:34:38,212 --> 01:34:41,129
There's a lot to do
before morning, Sherman.

1002
01:34:41,297 --> 01:34:42,339
ZEB:
What are you doing?

1003
01:34:42,507 --> 01:34:43,923
(GUNSHOT)

1004
01:34:44,341 --> 01:34:47,300
(CHATTERING AND HOOVES PATTERING)

1005
01:35:00,976 --> 01:35:03,310
Why did you make me do that?

1006
01:35:51,425 --> 01:35:53,134
MAN:
Fire.

1007
01:37:33,324 --> 01:37:35,282
Hey, Zeb!

1008
01:38:00,466 --> 01:38:02,633
Didn't you get my letter?

1009
01:38:03,801 --> 01:38:06,469
I wrote more than four months ago.

1010
01:38:09,096 --> 01:38:10,846
She never was...

1011
01:38:11,014 --> 01:38:15,141
...quite the same
after she got the mews about Pa.

1012
01:38:18,269 --> 01:38:21,479
I don't think she minded going.
Zeb, except...

1013
01:38:23,105 --> 01:38:25,397
...she wanted to see you again.

1014
01:38:30,235 --> 01:38:33,236
Of course Pa ain't really there.

1015
01:38:35,613 --> 01:38:37,948
I put up a stone anyway.

1016
01:38:57,086 --> 01:38:58,669
Well...

1017
01:38:59,337 --> 01:39:01,462
...better be on my way.

1018
01:39:02,005 --> 01:39:04,506
Way? Where?

1019
01:39:04,674 --> 01:39:06,590
I meed you, Zeb.

1020
01:39:06,758 --> 01:39:09,217
Only one thing brought me back.

1021
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,302
She's...

1022
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:14,762
Well, this farm is half yours.

1023
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:19,516
I was thinking we'd finally clear away that
patch of woods down by the river and...

1024
01:39:19,683 --> 01:39:23,351
You're twice the farmer I an.
You don't meed me.

1025
01:39:23,519 --> 01:39:27,145
Farm's all yours. It's only fair.

1026
01:39:28,522 --> 01:39:31,314
Sure don't feel right about this.

1027
01:39:31,482 --> 01:39:32,983
What are you gonna do?

1028
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,817
I haven't mustered out yet.

1029
01:39:34,985 --> 01:39:37,110
I can still transfer to the regulars.

1030
01:39:37,278 --> 01:39:40,362
Cavalry, maybe. Go west.

1031
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:43,030
Have to fight Indians?

1032
01:39:43,865 --> 01:39:46,241
You sure are hard to make out. Zeb.

1033
01:39:46,409 --> 01:39:50,410
Now, what do you wanna do that for?
Do you like fighting?

1034
01:39:51,704 --> 01:39:55,871
You remember the story Pa used to tell us
about fighting that grizzly bear?

1035
01:39:56,039 --> 01:39:57,123
Yeah.

1036
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:00,542
And I asked him, I said.
"Well. why'd you get in such a fix?

1037
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:03,127
Do you like fighting grizzlies?"

1038
01:40:03,295 --> 01:40:04,836
He said:

1039
01:40:05,004 --> 01:40:09,339
(IMITATING RAWLINGS)
"Well. uh. not especially. Uh...

1040
01:40:09,548 --> 01:40:14,050
I just wanted to go somewhere
and the bear was there first."

1041
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:28,226
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Well, I...

1042
01:40:31,187 --> 01:40:33,980
I guess I just wanna go somewhere too.

1043
01:40:38,233 --> 01:40:41,693
So long.
So long, Zeb.

1044
01:41:00,873 --> 01:41:04,166
Even while North and South
were being torn apart...

1045
01:41:04,334 --> 01:41:08,209
...East and West had been
drawn together by the Pony Express...

1046
01:41:08,377 --> 01:41:10,794
...the most daring mail route in history.

1047
01:41:10,962 --> 01:41:14,630
Eighty riders were in the saddle at all
times, night and day, in all weather.

1048
01:41:14,798 --> 01:41:17,591
Half of them riding east,
half riding west...

1049
01:41:17,759 --> 01:41:19,884
...between Missouri and Sacramento...

1050
01:41:20,052 --> 01:41:24,094
...carrying mail across country
in days instead of months.

1051
01:41:24,262 --> 01:41:27,055
Unarmed, they rode to save weight.

1052
01:41:27,222 --> 01:41:30,891
Five dollars a letter, the mail cost,
and on thin paper too.

1053
01:41:31,059 --> 01:41:34,018
It was courage, skill and speed...

1054
01:41:34,186 --> 01:41:39,688
...against hostile Indians, bandits,
hell and occasional high water.

1055
01:41:40,231 --> 01:41:42,648
Even as they rode,
men were already building...

1056
01:41:42,816 --> 01:41:47,610
...a faster message carrier across
the country: the Overland Telegraph.

1057
01:41:47,778 --> 01:41:50,278
And the Indians found
a mew amusement...

1058
01:41:50,446 --> 01:41:53,614
...listening to the level tune
of the singing wires.

1059
01:41:53,782 --> 01:41:55,907
But far less amusing to the Indians...

1060
01:41:56,075 --> 01:41:59,951
...was the coming of the steel roadway
of the iron horse.

1061
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:06,121
The surveyors' route lay through immense
natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...

1062
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:09,540
...and the equally discouraging
High Sierras.

1063
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:13,627
But range upon range could never stop
the titanic contest...

1064
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:16,295
...between two corporate giants
racing to put down...

1065
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:19,797
...the greatest mileage of track
before they met.

1066
01:42:19,964 --> 01:42:24,759
The Central Pacific eastward
from Sacramento through the Sierras.

1067
01:42:28,595 --> 01:42:32,680
And the Union Pacific,
forging westward across the plains...

1068
01:42:32,848 --> 01:42:34,723
...with the Rockies still to come.

1069
01:42:34,891 --> 01:42:40,435
The prize in the race was free land,
vast parcels for every mile of track laid.

1070
01:42:40,603 --> 01:42:44,021
Land that would one day
be worth millions.

1071
01:42:49,192 --> 01:42:50,983
MAN 1:
Hold it.

1072
01:42:51,151 --> 01:42:52,943
Set it down.

KING:
What the hell is this? A picnic?

1078
01:43:13,999 --> 01:43:16,014
Well, the Indians got
a couple of our men...

1079
01:43:16,045 --> 01:43:17,808
Mister, you were
the foreman here.

1080
01:43:17,839 --> 01:43:20,919
Now you're a track-layer.
Now get back to work. all of you!

1081
01:43:21,087 --> 01:43:22,462
Move it!

1082
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:24,255
Fast!

1083
01:43:24,423 --> 01:43:25,548
You.
Yes, sir.

1084
01:43:25,714 --> 01:43:28,049
You're the foreman
till I can find somebody better.

1085
01:43:28,217 --> 01:43:29,550
Yes, sir.
Get then at it.

1086
01:43:29,717 --> 01:43:31,676
Wait a minute.
Move it!

1087
01:43:31,844 --> 01:43:34,594
Your name Jethro Stuart?

1088
01:43:34,887 --> 01:43:36,179
MAN:
All right. get at it.

1089
01:43:36,347 --> 01:43:39,973
Well, Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired
to hunt buffalo to feed these men...

1090
01:43:40,141 --> 01:43:43,684
...not to stop their work.
Why'd you bring these bodies here?

1091
01:43:43,852 --> 01:43:46,978
They're railroaders. I thought somebody
in the railroad night be interested.

1092
01:43:47,146 --> 01:43:50,021
I'm the railroad and I'm not interested.

1093
01:43:50,189 --> 01:43:53,440
You should've buried them,
then tracked down the Indians who did it.

1094
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,900
Well, Mr. King, like you said.
I was hired to hunt...

1095
01:43:57,068 --> 01:44:00,194
...not to dig graves or fight Indians.

1096
01:44:00,362 --> 01:44:02,070
Those fellas are mostly old soldiers.

1097
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:04,738
You wouldn't think a couple
dead men bother them much.

1098
01:44:04,906 --> 01:44:08,783
I don't want anything in their thick skulls
but their work. Do you understand?

1099
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:11,994
Now, get rid of those bodies.
Start tracking those Indians.

1100
01:44:12,162 --> 01:44:16,872
You keep forgetting, Mr. King,
my job's buffalo.

1101
01:44:18,832 --> 01:44:20,666
It was buffalo.

1102
01:44:20,834 --> 01:44:23,209
Go to the paymaster and draw your time.

1103
01:44:23,377 --> 01:44:25,794
Well, now. that foreman fella,
you didn't fire him.

1104
01:44:25,962 --> 01:44:28,754
You just took him down a peg
because you needed him.

1105
01:44:28,922 --> 01:44:30,881
Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?

1111
01:45:11,115 --> 01:45:14,909
Just rode in. I'm hungry.
You are. huh?

1112
01:45:15,744 --> 01:45:18,244
But you'd rather watch them than eat.

Is that it?
That's it.

1114
01:45:20,246 --> 01:45:23,664
Well, I wish you were as eager
to protect this railroad.

1115
01:45:23,832 --> 01:45:26,917
Did you get any word about those two men
who were killed today?

1116
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:30,126
I tracked the Arapahos
and talked to the chief.

1117
01:45:30,294 --> 01:45:32,378
Those men were a mile off
the right-of-way...

1118
01:45:32,546 --> 01:45:35,630
...where they had no business,
drunk and chasing squaws.

1119
01:45:35,797 --> 01:45:37,669
As much their fault as
it was the Indians'.

Is that a fact?

1121

Well, soldier boy, your job is to fight
Indians, not to agree with then.

1122
01:45:44,178 --> 01:45:48,639
Mr. King, there were 200 Arapahos
and I had 20 men.

1123
01:45:48,806 --> 01:45:50,556
Now, to me...

1124
01:45:50,724 --> 01:45:52,766
...agreeing seemed wiser than fighting.

1125
01:45:52,934 --> 01:45:54,893
To you, huh?

1126
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:58,686
Well, you know, I might just send off
a wire to the colonel.

1127
01:45:58,938 --> 01:46:01,104
He may not agree.

1128
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:04,899
I already reported. He does agree.

Hey, lieutenant.

1134
01:46:53,556 --> 01:46:55,640
I got a message:
Indians are up to something.

1135
01:46:55,807 --> 01:46:57,558
You know anything about it?

1136
01:46:57,892 --> 01:47:00,476
Chief says railroad busted the agreement.

1137
01:47:00,644 --> 01:47:03,979
Changed the route. come snack
through Arapaho hunting grounds.

1138
01:47:04,145 --> 01:47:06,564
You sure the chief's right?
Plenty sure.

1139
01:47:06,731 --> 01:47:08,982
They're getting the war paint ready.

1140
01:47:12,693 --> 01:47:14,569
Can you stand there and tell me...

1141
01:47:14,903 --> 01:47:18,612
...that one little change is gonna cost
the Arapahos one buffalo.

Or even one jackrabbit?
Mr. King.

1143

They can be made to see it differently.
Who's hurting then?

1144
01:47:24,784 --> 01:47:27,827
What's a railroad anyway?
Two tracks and a whistle.

1145
01:47:28,662 --> 01:47:32,121
It's not the tracks they're afraid of.
It's what the tracks bring.

1146
01:47:32,289 --> 01:47:35,123
The buffalo hunters slaughtering off
their herds.

1147
01:47:35,291 --> 01:47:36,958
And then the settlers coning in.

1148
01:47:37,126 --> 01:47:40,002
And when will that be?
Twenty, 30 years, maybe?

1149
01:47:40,168 --> 01:47:42,336
By then. we'll all be dead.

1150
01:47:42,504 --> 01:47:44,671
Right now we're just crossing the land.

1151
01:47:44,839 --> 01:47:48,506
That's all. Land that's safe
to the Arapahos for our lifetime.

1152
01:47:48,674 --> 01:47:49,841
Now, you go talk to then.

1153

Smoke a peace pipe with then.
Do anything they want.

1154
01:47:53,136 --> 01:47:55,344
Just get them to make a mew agreement.

1155

That's your job. isn't it?
Keeping the peace?

1156
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:04,267
I'll keep the peace. Mr. King...

1157
01:48:04,435 --> 01:48:06,810
...but you keep your promise.

1158

you're from Ohio.

Linus Rawlings, could it?

1164

Your ma...

1169

She must've been something real special
getting old Linus to stay put.

1170
01:48:51,131 --> 01:48:54,715
She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.

1171

Old Linus.

Two years running once.
Your pa and me trapped together.

Up along the Waumakee.

1174
01:49:01,512 --> 01:49:04,055
Got so many beaver,
we had to tie them tail-to-tail...

1175
01:49:04,222 --> 01:49:06,139
...just to drag them down the mountain.

Over a mile long it was,
that lime of beaver pelts.

Mr. Stuart, my father could take the truth
and stretch it about six ways.

1178
01:49:14,062 --> 01:49:16,146
You sound just like him.

I'll take it you meant that kindly.

1180
01:49:19,815 --> 01:49:22,858
Well, I'd think twice
before I called you a liar.

Tell me something.
talking about liars.

1182
01:49:25,944 --> 01:49:30,696
Why would a son of old Linus
get mixed up with a man like Mike King?

1183
01:49:31,573 --> 01:49:33,074
I know what you mean.

1184
01:49:33,241 --> 01:49:36,241
But Mike King isn't the railroad.
Oh?

1185
01:49:36,409 --> 01:49:38,577
I don't think he knows that.

1186
01:49:38,745 --> 01:49:41,204
He's changing the route back, is he?

1187
01:49:41,372 --> 01:49:42,829
No.

1188
01:49:43,748 --> 01:49:44,747
I know.

1189
01:49:44,915 --> 01:49:47,916
But he'd do anything
to gain a day on the Central Pacific.

1190
01:49:48,084 --> 01:49:52,711
He's not a fool. He doesn't want a war,
and neither do the Arapahos.

1191
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:56,254
I think I could get then to agree
to this change in route...

1192
01:49:56,422 --> 01:49:58,589

for a while.

1237
01:53:45,701 --> 01:53:48,370
We scout for you no more.

1238
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:55,791
Not in our lifetime. you said.

1239
01:53:55,959 --> 01:54:00,086
And there they are.
The buffalo slaughterers and the settlers.

1240
01:54:00,254 --> 01:54:02,879
All right. it's sooner than I figured.

1241
01:54:03,047 --> 01:54:06,257
But the railroad's broke.
They meed money to keep moving on.

1242
01:54:06,424 --> 01:54:08,717
No people, no money.
No money, no railroad.

1243
01:54:08,885 --> 01:54:11,511
It's as simple as that.
What about the Arapahos?

1244
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:15,556
Just take a look at those people.
Half of them straight from Europe.

1245
01:54:15,723 --> 01:54:17,849
They'll have a rough time.
but they'll make it.

1246
01:54:18,016 --> 01:54:19,933
And do you wanna know
why they'll make it?

1247
01:54:20,101 --> 01:54:23,561
Because they're willing
to change their ways.

1248
01:54:23,728 --> 01:54:26,771
Arapahos will have to change too.
If they don't, they're finished.

1249
01:54:26,939 --> 01:54:29,816
I know they have to
and someday the land will be taken over...

1250
01:54:29,984 --> 01:54:32,526
...by these farmers
with their towns and their cattle.

1251
01:54:32,694 --> 01:54:33,901
But not like this.

1252
01:54:34,069 --> 01:54:37,487
They don't have to be double-crossed,
and I don't have to be a part of it.

1253
01:54:37,655 --> 01:54:39,906
You don't, lieutenant?

1254
01:54:40,074 --> 01:54:42,283
Well, aren't you forgetting that uniform?

1255
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:44,659
That's right, Mr. King, I'm forgetting it.

1256
01:54:44,827 --> 01:54:48,120
If the Army hasn't got any authority
out here. I'm resigning. And now.

1257
01:54:48,288 --> 01:54:50,455
I don't see how that's
gonna help the Arapahos.

1258
01:54:50,623 --> 01:54:51,956
Nothing will help then.

1259
01:54:52,124 --> 01:54:54,833

They've quit.

1274
01:58:51,668 --> 01:58:53,794
They'll be back.

1275
01:58:54,171 --> 01:58:58,756
They just sent a bunch of animals to kill
an animal they call the "iron horse."

1276
01:58:58,923 --> 01:59:01,300
Well, it's still standing, isn't it?

Appears you're doing well.

Can't complain.

No white men looking
over my shoulder...

...and the Indians are plumb cordial.

Toss your stuff in there.
Plenty of room for two.

1300

Thanks.

You'll be bunking yonder.

you can build your own cabin.

Thanks. I'm just passing through.
Through to where?

1306

Anywhere you go is like
where you've been.

Ain't you lost enough tail feathers
back there?

1308
02:01:40,121 --> 02:01:42,205
I've been plucked some.

1309
02:01:43,124 --> 02:01:45,082
But that's what I like about this country.

1310
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:48,209
There's always greener grass
over the next hill.

1311
02:01:48,377 --> 02:01:51,211
Not no more.
Not since that damn railroad come.

1312
02:01:51,379 --> 02:01:54,922
All the grass is being staked out now.
with a lock on it.

1313
02:01:57,091 --> 02:02:00,676
Maybe I'll just have to climb
a little higher hill to find it.

1314
02:02:03,597 --> 02:02:05,096
How about coning along?

trees around here feel no call to move."

But I'm sure not a rock nor a tree.

1320
02:02:19,608 --> 02:02:22,775
Man belongs his own kind,
like him or not.

1321
02:02:58,886 --> 02:03:03,137
The coming of railroads brought changes
in the land through which they passed.

1322
02:03:03,305 --> 02:03:06,973
Now immense herds of cattle were driven
hundreds of miles to meet the limes...

1323
02:03:07,141 --> 02:03:08,975
...bound for markets in the East.

1324
02:03:09,517 --> 02:03:12,685
Fences went up, cattle
trails were barred...

1325
02:03:12,978 --> 02:03:16,730
...and a long and bloody wrangle began
between cattlemen and homesteaders.

1326
02:03:17,315 --> 02:03:21,400
The law was in the hands of whoever
could shoot fast and straight...

1327
02:03:21,568 --> 02:03:25,779
...except where there was somebody
determined to stand for law.

1328
02:03:25,947 --> 02:03:29,698
Others might look on sheep and a shepherd
as a pastoral scene.

1329
02:03:29,865 --> 02:03:31,783
(GUNSHOT)

1330
02:03:32,409 --> 02:03:33,867
Not the cattleman.

1331
02:03:34,035 --> 02:03:39,622
To him, sheep destroyed grass,
and grass came dear.

1332
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:42,415
And if a man's life were held cheaper
than grass...

1333
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:46,585
...it was considered a casualty of war,
not a crime.

1334
02:03:46,753 --> 02:03:52,464
And, in all this, the man with the star
was only one against many.

1335
02:03:52,882 --> 02:03:55,675
But time was running out
for the reckless ones...

1336
02:03:55,842 --> 02:03:59,511
...the desperadoes,
the gallop-and-gunshot boys...

1337
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:02,471
...as more and more citizens demanded
respect for the law...

1338
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:05,515
...and showed themselves ready to fight
to uphold it.

1339
02:04:05,683 --> 02:04:09,017
And the raw mew towns that sprung up
in the West began to dream...

1340
02:04:09,185 --> 02:04:13,938
...of becoming as refined as that one-time
hooligan city by the Golden Gate.

1341
02:04:14,106 --> 02:04:16,398
San Francisco was now respectable.

1342
02:04:16,565 --> 02:04:20,526
So sophisticated, in fact,
it even had mansions up for auction.

is solid gold and fully inscribed.

"Mr. Cleve Van Valen, president.
San Francisco-Kansas City Railroad."

1348
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:39,580
It's a treasure he held dear to his heart.

1349
02:04:39,748 --> 02:04:43,667
Do I hear $3000
for this priceless possession?

1350
02:04:43,835 --> 02:04:46,210
Priceless, my foot.

1351
02:04:46,378 --> 02:04:48,713
We used it for a doorstop.

1352
02:04:49,213 --> 02:04:51,715
Twenty-five hundred.
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

1353
02:04:51,882 --> 02:04:53,716
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

1354
02:04:53,883 --> 02:04:56,551
Twenty-five hundred? Sold $2500.

1355
02:04:57,261 --> 02:04:59,386
It's a sad day, Lilith.

1356
02:04:59,554 --> 02:05:01,054
Sad?

1357
02:05:01,222 --> 02:05:03,889
We made and spent
three fortunes together.

1358
02:05:04,057 --> 02:05:06,058
What's so sad about that?

1359
02:05:06,225 --> 02:05:09,893
And if he'd lived a little longer,
we would've made and spent another.

1360
02:05:10,186 --> 02:05:12,313
I beg your pardon, Mrs. Van Valen.
What?

1361
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,439
The chair, it's been sold. I'm sorry.

1362
02:05:14,606 --> 02:05:17,274
Well then. take it.
Quit apologizing and take it.

1363
02:05:17,442 --> 02:05:18,692
Thank you, madam.

1364
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:21,402
If there'd been some other way
to pay off the debts...

1365
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:22,862
It doesn't matter.

1366
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:26,489
I've got two things
no one can ever take from me:

1367
02:05:27,157 --> 02:05:30,700
This and my land in Arizona.

1368
02:05:30,868 --> 02:05:33,827
Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes...

1369
02:05:33,995 --> 02:05:36,204
...but that ranch is nearly worthless.

1370
02:05:36,372 --> 02:05:37,872
Well, it's there, isn't it?

1371
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:40,915
Yes. but most of the cattle
have been sold off or stolen.

1372
02:05:41,083 --> 02:05:43,585
I'll get cattle.
You'll meed someone to work it.

1373
02:05:43,753 --> 02:05:46,086
Someone to manage it for you.
I'll get that too.

1374
02:05:46,254 --> 02:05:47,378
Who?

1375
02:05:47,546 --> 02:05:51,590
My nephew.
He's a marshal out there somewhere.

1376
02:05:51,758 --> 02:05:55,509
Now, Lilith. at your age,
it might be kind of rough.

1377
02:05:56,094 --> 02:05:57,678
Rough?

1378
02:05:57,845 --> 02:06:02,639
My ma and pa were killed
going down the river just looking for land.

1379
02:06:03,224 --> 02:06:07,435
I guess I got a little of that
Prescott blood in me after all.

1380
02:06:16,317 --> 02:06:17,359
Pa?

1381
02:06:17,943 --> 02:06:21,944
Is Aunt Lilith's house on Nob Hill
as high as that?

1382
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:24,822
I don't know. son.

1383
02:06:24,990 --> 02:06:28,824
On our way home. you ask your aunt Lilith.
She'll tell you.

1384
02:07:17,568 --> 02:07:20,153
Homey? Do you think you'll know her?

1385
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,821
What?
You aunt Lilith.

1386
02:07:21,988 --> 02:07:24,656
Do you think you'll recognize her?
Sure.

1387
02:07:24,824 --> 02:07:28,158
Zeb? What's the matter?

1388

Sam?

1403
02:08:21,197 --> 02:08:24,699
San's our horse.
He could pull two wagons if he wanted.

1404
02:08:24,867 --> 02:08:28,660
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
I have my orders to meet San.

There were three men waiting for him.

Ain't you even curious?

1458
02:11:37,461 --> 02:11:40,963
Well, what do you want me to do?
Run him out of town at the point of a gun?

02:17:32,504 --> 02:17:34,255
No one's making you.

1544
02:17:34,422 --> 02:17:37,507
We could ride out of here right now.
We could forget it.

1545
02:17:41,261 --> 02:17:44,720
Maybe there's
something you haven't told me.

1546
02:17:45,222 --> 02:17:47,097
Is there. Zeb?

1547
02:17:51,101 --> 02:17:54,018
I'm asking you not to go.

1548
02:17:54,687 --> 02:17:56,436
Please.

1549
02:17:56,771 --> 02:17:59,189
Don't go.

1550
02:18:00,357 --> 02:18:01,691
Sorry, Julie.

1551
02:18:19,454 --> 02:18:25,291
I guess there's nothing more pigheaded
in a nan than his sense of honor.

1552
02:18:25,458 --> 02:18:29,210
They're all the same, every one of then.

1553
02:18:29,378 --> 02:18:31,461
You take my Cleve now.

1554
02:18:31,629 --> 02:18:34,088
Never could turn down a poker game.

1555
02:18:34,256 --> 02:18:36,382
Felt duty-bound to go.

1556
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:39,092
Three nights running sometimes,
but he wouldn't quit...

1557
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:42,344
...not if his life depended on it. He...

1558
02:18:43,847 --> 02:18:45,722
I guess it isn't very funny.

1559
02:18:45,890 --> 02:18:47,515
PRESCOTT:
Ma?

1560
02:18:47,891 --> 02:18:48,932
Where's Pa?

1561
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:51,601
LILITH: Out. That's where he is.
What's the matter with Mon?

1562
02:18:51,768 --> 02:18:54,562
Nothing's the matter.
Come on. now, in the other room.

1563
02:18:54,729 --> 02:18:56,855
What's the matter?
LILITH: Come on, we're gonna play.

1564
02:18:57,023 --> 02:18:58,647
That's a good girl. That's better.

1565
02:18:58,815 --> 02:19:01,317
LINUS: What's the matter with Mama?
Nothing's the matter.

1566
02:19:01,484 --> 02:19:02,609
Do you know any games?

1567
02:19:02,776 --> 02:19:04,694
PRESCOTT: We know tag.
LINUS: Musical chairs.

1568
02:19:04,862 --> 02:19:06,612
Ugh. Tag.
I know hide-and-seek.

1569
02:19:06,779 --> 02:19:08,487
Well, do you know how to play poker?

1570
02:19:08,655 --> 02:19:09,655
Poker?
Poker?

1571
02:19:09,823 --> 02:19:13,533
You're in luck. Sit down right there.
Now, come on, sit down. That's it.

1572
02:19:13,784 --> 02:19:15,576
But we don't know how to play poker.

1573
02:19:15,744 --> 02:19:18,078
Well, it's time you learned.

1574
02:19:18,246 --> 02:19:21,915
First, we'll start off
with a little five-card stud.

1575
02:19:40,345 --> 02:19:42,512
I'll take that rifle, Zeb.

1576
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:43,846
Your pistol too.

1577
02:19:47,183 --> 02:19:49,059
Sorry, Lou.

1578
02:19:49,435 --> 02:19:50,809
I just can't oblige.

1579
02:20:00,317 --> 02:20:02,652
Thought the law wouldn't let you
use that anymore.

1580
02:20:03,736 --> 02:20:05,362
I'll use it if I have to.

1581
02:20:05,947 --> 02:20:09,198
I'm going out of here. Lou,
and I'm taking this with me.

1582
02:20:09,699 --> 02:20:11,199
To kill Gant.

1583
02:20:11,367 --> 02:20:13,326
That's what you think, isn't it?

1584
02:20:13,494 --> 02:20:16,203
It's something personal
between him and me.

1585
02:20:16,371 --> 02:20:18,704
Well, Lou. it could be...

1586
02:20:18,872 --> 02:20:22,290
...if I settle down with my family
and wait for him to come.

1587
02:20:22,458 --> 02:20:26,001
And he'll come
if I don't stop him here and now.

1588
02:20:26,169 --> 02:20:29,712
I'm gonna catch Gant red-handed,
breaking the law...

1589
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:33,715
...and then I'm gonna use the law
to put him away once and for all.

1590
02:20:33,883 --> 02:20:35,132
The law, Lou.

1591
02:20:35,592 --> 02:20:37,385
I'm gonna use the law...

1592
02:20:37,552 --> 02:20:40,428
...but I haven't got much chance
without your help.

1593
02:21:05,905 --> 02:21:07,531
How many men in the caboose?

1594
02:21:07,699 --> 02:21:09,073
Just one brakeman.

1595
02:21:09,241 --> 02:21:12,534
Is he armed?
No, never has been.

1596
02:21:12,702 --> 02:21:14,911
I'll be in the express car.

1597
02:21:20,624 --> 02:21:21,916
Thanks, Lou.

1598
02:21:22,084 --> 02:21:25,918
Marshal?
There's some riders up ahead.

1599
02:21:26,753 --> 02:21:29,088
ZEB:
I'll take a look.

1600
02:21:48,978 --> 02:21:51,520
Engineer. there's a barricade ahead!

1601
02:21:51,688 --> 02:21:53,438
Open it up, wide open.

1602
02:22:19,499 --> 02:22:20,957
Zeb!

1603
02:22:21,125 --> 02:22:24,127
Come on. Come on.

1604
02:22:44,017 --> 02:22:45,975
GANT: Everyone make it?
Frenchy's horse fell.

1605
02:22:46,143 --> 02:22:48,186
I don't think he made it.
Well, let's move.

1606
02:22:48,353 --> 02:22:50,312
It's a long way from here to that gold.

1607
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:52,313
There's no danger. Just keep going.

1608
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:12,660
It's Rawlings.

1609
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:13,287
(YELLS)

1610
02:24:43,476 --> 02:24:45,060
Back this train up!

1611
02:24:45,228 --> 02:24:46,435
And fast!

1612
02:24:46,603 --> 02:24:48,187
(GANT CACKLES)

1613
02:27:13,374 --> 02:27:15,166
How come we're leaving so early, Pa?

1614
02:27:15,334 --> 02:27:18,085
ZEB:
We got a long way to go, son.

1615
02:27:18,253 --> 02:27:19,836
Here.

1616
02:27:23,423 --> 02:27:25,590
Auntie, when we going to your house?

1617
02:27:25,758 --> 02:27:27,967
Your daddy will decide
when we get to your home.

1618
02:27:28,134 --> 02:27:29,677
Auntie, can we take San with us?

1619
02:27:29,844 --> 02:27:32,679
I think Sam is taking us.

1620
02:27:54,403 --> 02:27:57,029
Pa, how much further is it
to Aunt Lilith's ranch?

1621
02:27:57,197 --> 02:28:00,573
Well, son, it's around the next bend,
the next bend...

1622
02:28:00,741 --> 02:28:03,200
...and the valley beyond.
Oh.

1623
02:28:03,576 --> 02:28:06,119
(HUMMING "HOME lN THE MEADOW")

1624
02:28:06,287 --> 02:28:09,788
Aunt Lilith. do you know that song?
LINUS: That's our song.

1625
02:28:09,956 --> 02:28:11,373
Your song?

1626
02:28:11,541 --> 02:28:15,625
I sang that song
long before your pa was ever born.

1627
02:28:16,043 --> 02:28:18,502
(SINGING "HOME lN THE MEADOW")

1628
02:28:20,130 --> 02:28:21,130
Come on.

1629
02:28:27,260 --> 02:28:28,884
Zeb.

1630
02:29:02,744 --> 02:29:09,247
The West that was won by its pioneers,
settlers, adventurers is long gone now.

1631
02:29:09,415 --> 02:29:11,874
Yet it is theirs forever.

1632
02:29:12,042 --> 02:29:16,627
For they left tracks in history that
will never be eroded by wind or rain...

1633
02:29:16,795 --> 02:29:22,465
...mever plowed under by tractors,
never buried in the compost of events.

1634
02:29:23,050 --> 02:29:26,760
Out of the hard simplicity of their lives,
out of their vitality...

1635
02:29:26,927 --> 02:29:29,428
...their hopes and their sorrows...

1636
02:29:29,596 --> 02:29:31,596
...grew legends of courage and pride...

1637
02:29:31,764 --> 02:29:35,599
...to inspire their children
and their children's children.

1638
02:29:36,267 --> 02:29:38,684
From soil enriched by their blood...

1639
02:29:38,852 --> 02:29:41,644
...out of their fever
to explore and build...

1640
02:29:41,812 --> 02:29:45,105
...came lakes where once
were burning deserts...

1641
02:29:45,357 --> 02:29:48,775
...came the goods of the earth,
mimes and wheat fields...

1642
02:29:48,942 --> 02:29:51,401
...orchards and great lumber mills...

1643
02:29:51,569 --> 02:29:54,904
...all the sinews of a growing country.

1644
02:29:56,156 --> 02:30:00,116
Out of their rude settlements,
their trading posts, came cities...

1645
02:30:00,284 --> 02:30:03,285
...to rank among the great ones
of the world.

1646
02:30:03,453 --> 02:30:06,579
All the heritage of a people
free to dream...

1647
02:30:06,747 --> 02:30:11,291
...free to act,
free to mold their own destiny.
