22
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,612
这个地方今日有个名字 并且在地图上有迹可寻
This land has a name today and is marked on maps.

23
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:10,054
但是这地名、地标、土地 全都是靠赢来的
But the names and the marks and the land all had to be won.

24
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:13,493
从大自然和土著手上赢得的
Won from nature and from primitive man.

25
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:19,499
五个世代之前 差不多一百二十五年前…
Five generations ago, a mere 125 years back...

26
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:23,008
大家只称这片土地为“西部”
...this land was known only as the West...

27
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:26,646
只有少数几个白人才知道这里
...known only to a handful of white men...

28
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:31,652
孤单的捕兽皮者在这片 广阔荒原里寻找海狸
...lonely trappers wandering its vastness in search of beaver.

29
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:35,661
这些人被称为山中居民 一群新世代的人
They were known as "mountain men", a new breed.

30
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:40,004
像吉姆布里哲 法兰屈瑞和萨柏特，奈勒斯罗林等人
Men like Jim Bridger, Linus Rawlings...

31
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,780
比印地安人更像印地安人 只差没印地安血统
...more Indian than the Indians in all but blood.

32
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:46,844
他们自订法律…
They held to no law but their own...

33
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:52,584
浮云游子，居无定所 永远不停地随处迁移
...drifted free as the clouds, settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.

34
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,828
带着长满茧的双足和未钉铁鞋的马 从不驻足于任何地方
Their mocassined feet and unshod horses left no trace on the land.

35
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,203
他们与那些和平相处的印地安人一样…
Like the Indians, with whom they were at peace...

36
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:07,014
他们除了自己找到的东西之外 其他什么都不要
...they wanted nothing beyond what they found and little of that.

37
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:12,251
群山…森林…荒野…
The mountains, the forests, the harsh country...

38
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,829
对他们而言，就像星星一样…
...were as unchanging to them as the stars...

39
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,227
永远都不会改变
...and just as unyielding.

40
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,300
在那群山和广阔平原遥遥之外…
Far behind the mountains, beyond the rolling plains...

41
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:27,605
他们离开了东部
...they had left the people of the East...

42
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:30,819
那些庸庸碌碌的人们
...people who were restless in another way.

43
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:32,237
（通往西部之关卡 伊利运河）

44
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,908
当他们看到高山时 便想到分水岭
The kind who would look at the mountain and see a watershed...

45
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,995
看到森林时 便想到用来盖屋子的木头
...look at the forest and see lumber for houses...

46
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:39,762
看到石头平原便想到农场
...look at a stony field and see a farm.

47
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:43,869
他们一心一意朝向西部迈进…
Their faces and their instincts had been turned to the West...

48
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:47,079
打从清教徒初次登陆美国之后
...ever since Plymouth Rock and James Town.

49
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,649
捕兽皮者跟随狼的行迹 或峡谷弯处前进…
The trapper's road was the trade of the wolf or the bend of the canyon.

50
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:57,188
但是携家带眷浩浩荡荡 追日前进…就必须有更宽阔的大路
But for whole families following the sun, there had to be broader ways.

52
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,060
但前进荒野没有陆路，只有水路
There were no roads into the woodlands, only rivers...

53
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,268
结果他们便跑错方向 要不往北，就是往南
...and they flowed in the wrong direction, north or south.

54
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:09,143
或者被挡在阿勒格尼山脚下
Or else they stopped at the Alleghanys.

55
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,312
直到有天
Until one day...

56
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:16,121
有个人发现一条新河流 这个人叫做度威克林顿
...a new river took source in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.

57
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:19,692
他认为这条河流能通往西部
He conceived of a river that would go west.

58
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:24,865
结果美国人拿出他们冒险患难的精神 证实果然没错
And in the way Americans have of acting out their dreams, it came to be.

59
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,641
伊利运河从艾柏尼之上 离开赫德森…
The Erie Canal left the Hudson above Albany...

60
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:31,148
然后流通到五大湖
...and carried clear across to the Great Lakes.

61
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:35,720
那些向往开垦处女地 展开新生活的人们…
People who yearned for virgin land and the new life...

62
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:39,659
现在有一条快速水路带领他们  许多人络绎不绝
...now had a highway to take them. And they moved along.

64
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,363
《乌提卡之光号》开始登船！
Pride of Utica now loading.

65
00:10:43,237 --> 00:10:46,264
（码头处）搭《乌提卡之光号》的人请登船！
All aboard for the Pride of Utica.

67
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:50,441
兰姆西一家！ 彼得史密斯！
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...

68
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,142
史寇卡一家！
...the Skoga family...

69
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,217
全部八个人！
...all eight of 'em.

70
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,022
所有人请登上《乌提卡之光号》！
All aboard for the Pride of Utica.

71
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:04,735
因为你们家儿子的健康 才会想搬去西部？
Is the laddie's health the reason you're heading west?

72
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,896
有一部分是
Partly.

73
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:08,909
我们大部分原因是 东部的土地太多石头了
Only partly. Mostly our trouble East was rocks.

74
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:12,739
几年前我有一个农场 一亩地挖出一百桶石头
I had me a farm where some years I'd raise 100 bushels of rocks a year.

75
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:15,218
齐伯伦，你别乱骗人家
Zebulon, you hadn't oughta lie to the man like that.

76
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,724
老婆，我可是老实人 我告诉他的都是实话
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul, and I tell the truth as I see it.

77
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:22,856
我从来不使用锄犁 我都拿火药炸出犁沟
I never used a plow. I'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.

78
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,161
结果有天早上
Then one mornin'...

79
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:26,169
我把桶子从井里舀上来…
...I hauled the bucket up out of the well and...

80
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,935
结果那桶子里居然满满都是石头
...so help me, the bucket was full of rocks.

81
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:29,998
石头！
Rocks.

82
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:33,306
我站在那里 试图不口出秽言
I just stood there right still trying not to blaspheme...

83
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,009
我对自己说 “你儿子身体不好”
...and said to myself: "You've got a son that's ailin'.

84
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,487
“一个不肯出嫁的女儿”
"You've got a 20-year-old daughter who won't take a husband."

85
00:11:38,524 --> 00:11:40,322
- 在那里，成天幻想做梦
There she sits, moonin' as usual.

86
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:41,189
- 爸
Pa.

87
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:44,265
“另一个女儿脑子不晓得在想什么”
"You've got another daughter, just don't seem quite right in the head."

88
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,322
莉莉丝？
Lilith.

89
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,197
什么事，爸？
Yes, Pa?

90
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,441
我告诉你啊…
I remind you, sir.

91
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,378
我站在那里 手中仍提着那装满石头的桶子…
I'm still standing there holding a bucket full of rocks...

92
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:59,950
呆呆看着它好久一段时间
...and staring into a bleak old age.

93
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:02,850
结果我便当场立誓说…
So I made me a vow right then and there. I said:

94
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:06,196
“如果我能找到一个身上有五百元 而且喜欢石头的人…”
"If I can find a man with $500 who likes rocks...

95
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:10,204
“那就让那个傻瓜来当 这农场的主人吧”
"...then there's gonna be another fool ownin' this farm."

96
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,005
结果上帝便派了那么一个人给我…
Well, sir, the Lord provided such a man...

97
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,310
现在我便在这里
...and here I am.

98
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:18,317
他根本就是唬你的 哈维先生
He ain't told you one word of truth, Mr. Harvey.

99
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:20,218
我们的农场是全镇最棒的
We had the best farm in the township.

100
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,555
是啊，整个“石头村”里最棒的 全都是石头！
Yeah, Rockville Township it was. Stone County.

101
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:24,060
喔，才不是呢！
Oh, it was not.

102
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,990
是他不安于室 才把我们一家子拖到这里
It was his itchin' foot that brought us here.

103
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,530
天晓得我们会在哪落脚
Heaven knows where we'll end up.

104
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:34,038
喔，这些是我的儿子们 安格斯，布鲁特斯和柯林
Oh, these are my laddies. Angus, Brutus and Colin.

105
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:35,511
- 你们好？ - 哈罗
-How do you do? -Hello.

106
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:38,847
他们好像已经和你们女儿认识了
I think they're already acquainted with your daughters.

107
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:40,886
- 他们都单身？
Be they single?

108
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:42,549
- 是的，目前都单身
Aye, single so far.

109
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,856
我开始觉得这伊利诺州很有意思唷！
Well, this Illinois country's beginning to sound better to me.

110
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,235
莉莉丝，过来唱首歌 给这几位小伙子听听
Lilith, strike up a little tune for these handsome lads.

112
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,636
- 喔，我没心情，爸
I ain't in no mood, Pa.

113
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,640
- 莉莉丝，平常可以耍脾气  现在可不准你！
Lilith, there's a time for coaxin'. This ain't the time.

115
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,860
好吧

116
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,578
好吧
All right.

117
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:06,184
一位住在海里费克斯的勇敢船长
"A captain bold in Halifax

118
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:08,321
在郡内落脚休息…
"Who lived in country quarters

119
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,391
背叛了一位女仆
"Betrayed a maid who hanged herself

120
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:13,098
有天早上她在房间里上吊自杀… 莉莉丝
-"One morning in her daughter's--" -Lilith!

121
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,678
你怎么唱这种不三不四的歌
Now, you know better than to sing a song like that.

123
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:19,312
- 你们知道什么歌？ - 我们知道《洋基大佬》
-What ones do you know? -We know "Yankee Doodle".

124
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,249
- 《洋基大佬》？ - 他们母亲早逝…
-"Yankee Doodle"? -Their mother's dead.

125
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:24,448
他们没学到什么社交礼仪
They haven't had much learnin' in the social graces since we left Scotland.

126
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:26,516
好吧，给他们唱 《家在草原上》吧
All right, give 'em "A Home in the Meadow".

127
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:31,591
【走，走，跟我走吧】
Away, away, come away with me

128
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:32,567
伊芙，来，你也一起唱
Eve, you, too.

129
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:35,471
【那荒野长着野草】 - 很好
Where the grass grows wild - That's it.

130
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:38,342
【而且风自由的吹】 - 来，加入
And the winds blow free - Come on, join in.

131
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:43,216
【走，走，跟我走吧】 - 很好，很好
Away, away, come away with me - That's it, that's it.

133
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:48,683
【我会和你在草地上安一个家】
"And I'll make you a home in the meadow

135
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,969
【来吧，来吧，有一片神奇的土地】
Come, come, there's a wondrous land

136
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:56,739
【为了充满希望的心】
For the hopeful heart

137
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:59,705
【荒野乐意帮助】
"For the willing hand

138
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:04,484
【来吧，来吧 ，有一片神奇的土地】
"Come, come, there's a wondrous land

139
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:09,660
【我将在这里为你在草地上建一个家】
Where I'll build you a home In the meadow"

140
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:13,056
搭《飞箭号》请上船！
Loading for the Flying Arrow.

141
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,401
所有搭《飞箭号》的人请上船！
All aboard for the Flying Arrow.

142
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,205
普莱斯考特家族！ 
The Prescott family.

143
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,540
我们在这里，快点
Here we be. Come on.

144
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:23,480
还有哈维及三个儿子！
Alex Harvey and three sons.

145
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:27,153
杰佛瑞罗斯及家人！
Jeffrey Rose and family.

146
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,528
【我有一个老骡子，她的名字叫贝尔】
"I've got an old mule and her name is Belle

147
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:35,227
【伊利运河十五英里】
"Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal

148
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:38,738
【她是走得非常慢的好朋友】
"She's a mighty slow worker But a good ole pal

149
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,577
【伊利运河十五英里】
"Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal

150
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:45,047
【驳船已拉了我们一天】
"We've pulled some barges in our day

151
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,153
【挤满了人，嘿！！！】
"Filled with people callin' 'hey'

152
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:50,449
【十五英里】
"Fifteen miles

153
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:53,190
【在伊利运河】
"On the Erie Canal! "

154
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,277
但运河只是前往希望之地的第一步
But the canal was only the first step toward the promised land.

155
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,575
接下来的阶段更为漫长艰辛
The next steps were longer and harder.

156
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:10,815
那些付得起更多船费的人 搭乘蒸汽船直达目的地
Those who could raise the fare went by steamboat to the end of the line.

157
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:15,221
其他人则透过较省钱的方式 前往俄亥俄州，伊利诺州…
Others found a cheaper way to head for Ohio, Illinois...

158
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:17,291
然后再往其他地方开垦发展
...and the open spaces beyond.

159
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:36,354
莉莉丝，莉莉丝，你听这个…
Lilith...listen to this:

160
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,360
“他们在林子里依依不舍地告别”
"Theirs was a poignant parting in the forest.

161
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,935
“年轻英俊的樵夫在树干上 刻出两颗心”
"The handsome young backwoodsman carved two hearts on a tree trunk...

162
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:49,714
“然后从十步处将刀射进 两颗心的交会处”
"...then from ten paces, hurled a knife at the junction of the two hearts."

163
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,684
交会处？什么东西？
Junction, what's that?

164
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,751
就是两颗心相印的地方 你再听…
Well, that's where the two hearts meet. Now, listen:

165
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,230
“他的刻工技法纯熟…”
"His marksmanship was uncanny.

166
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,298
“他连续三次都将刀子射中目标
"Three times he hurled the knife on target.

167
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:04,535
第一次他说代表幸运”
"'That was for luck', he said the first time.

168
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:07,911
“第二次刺中他说代表着深刻的 神圣的爱情”
"'That was for love, deep, divine love', he said the second.

169
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,977
“第三次代表着祈求一份
"And the third time, 'That was a prayer...

170
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:13,514
永远不消逝的爱情”
"'...a plea for love undying."'

171
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:16,193
是不是很美呢？
Isn't that beautiful?

172
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,698
是啊，如果真有人那样讲话的话
I reckon. If anybody ever talks like that.

173
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:23,262
重点是在感觉，不是那些话语
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.

174
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,776
你真的很奇怪耶，伊芙…
There ain't no sense to you, Eve.

175
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:29,441
你想当农夫老婆 但你却不肯嫁给农夫
You want to be a farm wife but you don't want to marry a farmer.

176
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:31,341
你也一样啊
Neither do you.

177
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:32,980
我当然不要
Of course not.

178
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:35,691
我才不要和农场扯上任何关系
I don't want to have nothin' to do with farms.

179
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,286
我要穿丝绸衣裳，坐华丽马车
I want silk dresses and fine carriages...

180
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,295
和一个味道高尚的男人
...and a man to smell good.

181
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,429
我想回东部，不是去西部
What I want's back East, not West...

182
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,474
我总有一天会去的，你看着好了
...and I'll get there yet. You watch.

183
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:48,869
你根本还不晓得自己要什么
You don't know what you want yet.

184
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:52,311
重点在于男人的特质 不是他住的地方
It's the man that counts, not where he lives.

185
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:02,393
- 准备好了吗？ - 准备好了
-Ready, man? -Ready.

186
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,718
爸爸！有人从下游来了
Daddy, somethin' comin' up river.

187
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:41,829
我猜是具敌意的印地安人
Hostile Indians, I expect.

188
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:06,032
- 会不会是河上海盗，齐伯伦？ - 不晓得
-Could it be river pirates, Zebulon? -Don't know.

189
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,131
听说正当的人不会在夜里 航行于这条河上
They say no honest man travels this river at night.

190
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:11,069
我只看到一个人，爸
I can only see one man, Pa.

191
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:14,743
听说那是海盗的惯用技俩 他们都躲在船里…
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick. They hide in the bottom of the boat...

192
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:16,579
等到接近时才发动突击
...till they're ready to jump you.

193
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:18,917
- 去拿枪，柯林 - 好的，爸
-Get my gun, Colin. -All right, Pa.

194
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:29,435
慢慢地靠近，陌生人
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.

195
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:32,465
把双手放在我们看得到的地方
And keep your hands where we can see 'em.

196
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:51,865
我叫奈勒斯罗林
Name's Linus Rawlings.

197
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:54,635
我肚子饿坏了 我绝无恶意
I'm hungrier than sin and real peaceful like.

198
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:57,174
- 你船上是什么东西？ - 海狸皮毛
-What've you got in the craft? -Beaver pelts.

199
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,111
我说过是海狸皮毛
I said beaver pelts.

200
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,990
我从没见过海狸皮毛 罗林先生
I never had a chance to see a beaver pelt, Mr. Rawlings.

201
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:07,489
那样的话，小姐 我拿一个给你看
Well, in that case, ma'am, I'll show you one.

202
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,599
你看
There you are.

203
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,001
好软喔
Oh, that's real soft.

204
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:13,734
这可是上等皮毛，小姐
It's a fine pelt, ma'am.

205
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,800
真对不起，先生
Now, my apologies, sir.

206
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,682
- 我们原先还担心你是海盗
We was afraid you might be a pirate.

207
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,908
我才不是海盗
I ain't no pirate.

208
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:22,682
来吧，咱们一起吃晚饭 多认识认识
Come on, let's have supper and get acquainted.

209
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:26,152
不用了，送你 你留着，小姐
No, no. That's yours. You keep that.

210
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,181
你动作还真快
Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.

211
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:46,783
他是不是你一直在等的 砍柴樵夫呢？
Is he the backwoodsman you've been waiting for?

212
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,092
我看他八成有个老婆和六个孩子 在家里等着他呢
More than likely he's got a wife and six kids waiting for him.

213
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:57,334
"When I was single

214
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,578
"Went dressed up so fine

215
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:05,954
"Now I am married

216
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:10,594
"Go ragged all the time."

217
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:18,272
谢谢你，小姐 真的太好吃了
Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.

218
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,873
你才吃四盘 我一开始还以为你不喜欢吃呢
You've only ate four plates. I was beginning to think you didn't like it.

219
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:25,249
空腹一开始吃不了太多，小姐
Well, it don't pay to eat too much on an empty stomach, ma'am.

220
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:28,750
你为什么这么晚还在旅行？
How come you to be travelin' so late at night?

221
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,988
因为我很想赶快去匹兹堡
Well, I'm kinda anxious to get to Pittsburgh.

222
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,797
我已经很久没见到大城市 我想赶路快点到达
I ain't seen a city for a long time. I aim to whoop it up a little.

223
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,271
我们从未见过山中居民
We've never seen a mountain man before.

224
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:41,278
告诉我，洛矶山脉真有人家说的 那么高吗？
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains as high as they say?

225
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:45,143
这个…我也不是很清楚 我从来没爬上去过，我…
Well, now, I just don't rightly know. I never climbed one.

226
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:52,657
不过呢…那也不尽然啦…
I've, well...that just ain't exactly true.

227
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:57,895
吉姆布里哲和我…我们一开始先爬
Jim Bridger and me, we started up one of them little biddy...

228
00:20:55,171 --> 00:21:00,259


229
00:20:57,972 --> 00:21:00,806
洛矶山脚下的一座小山
...Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.

230
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:04,342
结果有一天 我们遇到一个人…
And then, one day, we see this fella...

231
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:08,714
他有一对巨大的白色翅膀…
...and he has a great big pair of white wings...

232
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,249
手里还抱着竖琴
...and a harp in his hand.

233
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:13,721
我便对吉姆说…
And I said to Jim...

234
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:17,796
“吉姆，我不喜欢这个人 看我们的样子”
...I said, "Jim, I don't like the way that fella's lookin' at us."

235
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:22,032
然后吉姆说他也不是很喜欢…
And Jim said he didn't care too much for it either...

236
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:24,710
结果我们便赶紧溜下山离开了
...so we both skidaddled down out of there...

237
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:28,743
直到今天 我从来没好好看过洛矶山一眼
...and to this day I ain't never had a good look at the Rocky Mountains.

238
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:36,689
- 我记得有一次… - 齐伯伦
-I remember one time-- -Zebulon.

239
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:37,392
- 怎样？
What?

240
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,870
一次一个人吹牛已经够了
One liar at a time is enough.

241
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,243
现在差不多该睡觉了
Well, then, I reckon it's about bedtime.

242
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:46,304
明天还得早起赶路呢
Gotta get an early start in the mornin'.

243
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:48,247
我们一起吃早餐，罗林先生
We'll be expectin' you for breakfast.

244
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,810
喔，你真是太客气了 普莱斯考特先生
Well, that's mighty hospitable, Mr. Prescott...

245
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,984
我经常一醒过来就要马上赶路
...but sometimes I wake up and get the urge to move.

246
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,722
日出之前我大概早就出发了 多谢你的邀请
I might be long gone by sunup, but I want to thank you.

247
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,833
- 非常感谢各位，晚安
I want to thank all of you. Good night.

248
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,959
- 晚安
Good night.

249
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:02,831
- 这些山中居民可真不寻常
Strange fellas, these mountain men.

250
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:05,344
- 是啊，来去有如一阵烟
Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.

251
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,338
- 哇！那看起来好像我的毯子
By golly, that looks like my blanket.

252
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:28,403
- 是你的毯子没错
It is.

253
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:32,078
那我可就糊涂了，小姐 这床是给谁睡的呢？
Well, then, I'm a might confused, ma'am. Whose bed would it be?

254
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:33,144
给你睡的
Yours.

255
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:38,388
打从我离开东岸之后 再也没看过这样的床
I ain't never saw a bed like that since last time I come East.

256
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,000
你为什么要帮我？
Why'd you do it?

257
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,063
问一个女孩为什么帮一个男人做事 是不礼貌的
It ain't polite to ask a girl why she done something for a man.

258
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:48,241
是啊，我的言行的确有些失礼
No. Well, I reckon my manners ain't much at that.

259
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:50,873
不过，我倒是很感谢你 晚安，小姐
Anyway, I sure thank you. Good night, ma'am.

260
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,487
那些印地安女孩漂亮吗？
Are them Indian girls pretty?

261
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:02,528
我认为这得视男人到底有多久…
Well, now, I reckon that all depends on just how long a man's gone...

262
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:04,303
没看到女人而定
...without seein' one.

263
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:08,237
你有多久没看到白人女孩？
How long's it been since you seen a white girl?

264
00:23:09,246 --> 00:23:11,613
我不确定你为什么这么问
I ain't quite sure why you asked that.

265
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:16,090
你觉得我有多漂亮？
How pretty do I look to you?

266
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,479
小姐…

267
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,852
你这样不会太开放了吧？
Ain't you just bein' a little bit forward?

268
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:26,572


269
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,232
你往上游走 我要往下游走
You're headed upriver and I'm headed down.

270
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:29,609
没有太多时间可以听你的回答
There's no time to get these questions answered.

271
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:35,043
你确定你想听我的回答？
You dead sure you want 'em answered?

272
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:38,112
是的
Yes.

273
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:53,274
老天…
Oh, glory be!

274
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:57,945
小姐，你好像从前曾经亲吻过
Ma'am, it seems like you've been kissed before.

275
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,525
我从未永久性地被亲吻过
I've never been kissed permanent before.

276
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,332
哇，你用字遣词真特别
By golly, you sure use surprising words.

277
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,307
我从没听过有人把“永久性”和 吻这玩意摆在一起形容
I never heard permanent mixed up with a thing like a kiss before.

278
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,181
我仍能感受到那份吻
I can still feel that kiss.

279
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:15,711
- 你能吗？
Can you?

280
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:18,717
- 你刚才讲了一句话…我还没忘记…
You said somethin' before we hadn't oughta forget:

281
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,358
我要往上游走 你要往下游走
I'm headin' upstream and you're headed downstream.

282
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,331
曾经分离过的情人终将再度聚首 - 小姐 - 叫我伊芙
Lovers have parted before and come together again.

283
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,882


284
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,410
伊芙，我是个罪孽深重的人
Eve, I, I'm a sinful man.

285
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:36,416
一个万劫不复的罪人
I'm deep, dark, sinful.

286
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:39,386
我正要前往匹兹堡再度当个罪人
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh to be sinful again.

287
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:42,423
我有可能会酒醉一个月
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.

288
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:45,429
我将不会记得我泡过的女人…
I won't even remember the fancy gals I dally with...

289
00:24:45,498 --> 00:24:48,434
或出自意气用事打过架的男人…
...or the men I carve up just out of pure cussedness...

290
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:50,495
更别说是记得你这个人
...any more than I'll remember you.

291
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:55,409
奈勒斯，我问你 你是否仍感觉到刚才那个吻？
Linus, I'm askin' you. Can you still feel that kiss?

292
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:58,010
伊芙…
Eve....

293
00:25:00,054 --> 00:25:04,493
伊芙，你让我感觉好像 踮着脚站在一道窄路上…
Eve, you make me feel like a man standing on a narrow ledge...

294
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:07,791
迎面挑战一头恶狠狠的大熊
...comin' face to face with a grizzly bear.

295
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,401
我根本无法不去面对那处境
There just ain't no ignorin' the situation.

296
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:36,743
伊芙！
Eve!

297
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:44,383
- 伊芙！她人呢？ - 齐伯，怎么回事？
Eve! Where is she?

298
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,760
你在就好 我以为你和他走了
Anyways, you're here. I thought you'd gone with him.

299
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,333
- 走了？ - 是的，走了
-Gone? -Yes, gone.

300
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:53,728
我就知道你喜欢他…
I knowed you were settin' with him...

301
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,905
但我一直告诉自己 “至少她喜欢男人”
...but I kept tellin' myself at least she's lookin' at a man.

302
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:59,739
即便像那种一阵烟的男人也好
Even a wisp of smoke like that is better than--

303
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:06,221
你在哭？为他哭？ 这是什么意思？
Are you cryin'? Cryin' for him? Now, what does that mean?

304
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,261
告诉我这是什么意思？
Now, tell me what that means.

305
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:11,692
没什么意思，爸
Nothin', Pa.

306
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:13,929
你几点上床睡觉的？
What time did you come to bed?

307
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,263
很早就睡了，爸
It was early, Pa.

308
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,140
不…很晚
It wasn't. It was late.

309
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,479
女儿啊，我只问你一次…
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.

310
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:25,755
有没有任何事情是值得 你妈和我担心的？
Is there anything for your ma and pa to worry about?

311
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:28,382
没有，爸，没事
No, Pa, there ain't.

312
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,187
他会再回来的
He'll be back.

313
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,557
我会再见到他的
I'll see him again.

314
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,926
但你原本以为今天早上会见到他 你是这么想的
But you expected to see him this morning. You know you did.

315
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:55,761
我不管，我会再见到他的
I don't care. I'll see him again.

316
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:58,330
你看…
Look.

317
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:06,810
- 你让一个大男人为你这么做？
You got a growed man to do that?

318
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:09,322
- 没错，就像书里写的一样
I did, just like in the book.

319
00:27:10,627 --> 00:27:12,960
你有让他对你说那些疯狂的话吗？
Did you get him to say them crazy words?

320
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:17,234
我说过了，重点不在那些话 而是那种感觉
I told you before, it ain't the words, it's the sentiment.

321
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:21,602
你是说他没有笑那些无聊的事？
You mean he didn't even giggle or nothin' at such foolishness?

322
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,912
他说那是很严肃的一件事
He said it was a real solemn occasion...

323
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:28,649
好像在急流中不用划板一样
...like shootin' the rapids without a paddle.

324
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:34,562
不管他怎么说，他这么做只是为了 打发你好赶紧脱身
No matter what he said, he did it just to get rid of you so as he could clear out.

325
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:35,997
你知道是这样没错的
You know that's so.

326
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:40,906
算你走运他那么做 你真打算懵懵懂懂过一辈子？
And you're lucky he did. Do you want to live like a squaw all your life?

327
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:43,034
随便你想说什么都行
Go on, say anything you like...

328
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,080
我一定会再见到他的 我知道我会的
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.

329
00:27:46,784 --> 00:27:48,980
而且他才没有老婆 也没有六个孩子
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.

330
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:51,680
他还没讨老婆呢！
He ain't got a wife at all yet.

331

（贩卖酒品 杰布霍金斯）

有客人来了！
Customer.

335
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:36,853
好像是捕兽皮者  瞧那鼓鼓的一团？
Trapper, seems like. See how that cover bellies up?

336
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,759


337
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,863
有可能是皮毛
Could be furs.

338
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,552
口渴吗，先生？
Thirsty, mister?

339
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:56,154
比热锅上的蚱蜢还要渴
Drier than a grasshopper on a hot griddle.

340
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:02,031
那么，欢迎您光临我们的小旅舍

他好像有一整船的皮毛呢，爸
Looks like he's got a whole canoe of furs, Pop.

345
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,614
- 一定是个山中居民 - 没错
-A sure enough mountain man. -Indeed.

346

爸，既然他是捕兽皮者
Pa, him being a trapper...

357
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,050
你想他会知道我们抓到的是什么野兽？
...do you suppose he might know what that varmint is we got?

358
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:03,997
或许吧…我想他应该会晓得
Well, say, now, he might. Yes, sir, he just might.

359
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,501

Sir, we catched us a cave-dwellin' critter...

360

在我们从没去过的地方抓到的
...that no man in these parts has ever seen before.

如果你能告诉我们 那到底是什么玩意就太好了
And, you know, it'd be right satisfyin' havin' you tell us what it is.

362
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,717
我对穴居野兽不太了解
Well, I don't know too much about cave-dwellin' varmints.

374
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:17,145
你有听到吗？
Do you hear him?

375

它的呼吸声又大又猛
He breathes loud and fierce.

376
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,649
- 我们把它关在那边的洞里 - 你们把它关在这里？
-We keep him in this hole just yonder. -You keep him in there?

377
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:28,163
你得再靠近点看
You gotta look a little closer.

378
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:50,701

- 我不太确定…
I ain't so sure.

381

他的肌肉结实 我可以感觉到他的肋骨锐利如刀片
He was hard-muscled. I could feel the blade just kinda skitter along his ribs.

382
00:31:57,246 --> 00:31:59,442
喔，你只需要多练习几次 没什么
You just need more practice, that's all.

383
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:02,084
真可惜你没有你妈的绝招
It's a pity you ain't got the knack your ma had...

384

只要一毛五
It's only 15 cents.

396
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,845
一毛五？给我放回去
Fifteen cents! Put it back.

397
00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:49,183
是啊，没错 省几毛钱，几块钱便因运而生
You're right, sir. Absolutely right. You save the pennies and dollars will grow.

398
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:51,247
钱慢慢积少成多
Likely you've growed many a dollar, ain't you?

00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:56,857
我目前为止还挺成功的
...and I think I've succeeded right well.

401
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,495
我袜子里只有几块钱 我不会乱花的
I've got a little put away in the sock and it'll stay right there.

402
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,074
我完全赞同你的说法
Well, now, them's my sentiments exactly.

403
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,576
先生，你看起来倒像个有钱人
Now, you, sir-- You look like a man of property.

404
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:08,608
若要我猜的话 我想你身价差不多一千元
Now, if I was to bet, I'd say you was worth a $1,000.

405
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:10,379
- 是不是挺接近呢？
Pretty close to the mark?

406
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:11,946
- 差不多，或许吧
Well, close, maybe.

407
00:35:08,013 --> 00:35:09,674
- 柯林，我们还剩下多少火药？
Colin, how much powder we got left?

408
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:12,184
- 别害怕，别怕
Don't be afeerd, now, don't be afeerd.

409
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:14,017
这里有女人和小孩
Now, there's women and children here.

410
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:17,457
你们不会希望我们开枪扫射吧？
You gents wouldn't want us to have to start shootin', now, would you?

411
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:19,493
大家冷静点
Be of good cheer, folks.

412
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:22,430
咱们的使命是开疆辟土…
Why, it's in our noble tradition to conquer the wilderness...

413
00:35:22,502 --> 00:35:25,063
凭着我们的赤手空拳和果断的心
...with nothin' but our bare hands and stout hearts.

414
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,169
你们大家可以拿出祖先的克难精神 再建造新的船筏
You can build new rafts and sally forth in the spirit of your forefathers.

415
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,442
你这个不要脸的小人！
Why, you pious old scoundrel.

416
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:34,078
你会下地狱！
I'll see you burn.

417
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,564
美国人不是那么好欺负的！
Americans can't be whipped.

418
00:35:44,804 --> 00:35:45,828
是他！
It's him.

419
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:48,333
我就知道他会回来！是他！
I knew he'd come back. It's him.

420
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:47,767
让我们一起来祈祷
Now, let us pray.

421
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,401
上帝啊…
Oh, Lord...

422
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,473
感谢您让我们逃过一劫
...we thank Thee for our salvation.

423
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:59,278
我们希望将死者的灵魂交托给您
We commit the souls of our dead to Thy gentle keepin'.

424
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:03,186
祈祷我们之中受伤的人能早日康复
We pray for a speedy recovery of our wounded.

425
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:08,196
另外还有一件事…
And, now, another matter.

426
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,562
上帝啊…
Oh, Lord...

427
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:13,901
在未曾请教过您的情况下…
...without consulting with Thee...

428
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:18,880
我们将几个被魔鬼缠附的灵魂 送到您那里
...we have sent Thy way some souls whose evil ways passeth all understanding.

429
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:22,749
我们恳求您收容那些灵魂
We ask Thee humbly to receive them...

430
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,431
不管您愿不愿意接受
...whether You want 'em or not.

431
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:27,489
阿们
Amen.

432
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:50,896
这得花点功夫修补
It'll be a job.

433
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,372
我一定能把它修好 然后前去匹兹堡
But I guess I can patch her up good enough to get to Pittsburgh.

434
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,468
- 奈勒斯… - 别这样，伊芙…
-Linus. -Now, Eve...

435
00:37:56,946 --> 00:37:59,438
我们别再谈这件事了
...let's just not talk any more about it.

436
00:38:00,352 --> 00:38:03,322
奈勒斯，我告诉你 你根本不懂你自己的心
Linus, I'm tellin' you, you don't know your own mind.

437
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:05,623
或许是，或许不是
Maybe so, maybe not.

438
00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:09,254
我并不是说我没偶尔想起你
I know I ain't sayin' that you haven't been on my mind some.

439
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:10,965
我并没那样说
I ain't sayin' that.

440
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:14,437
但我仍和那个海盗女 一起跑去看野兽
But I still went to see the varmint with that pirate girl.

441
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:17,472
我永远都会想要跑去看“野兽”，伊芙
I'll always be goin' to see the varmint, Eve.

442
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:21,815
我根本不是农夫或丈夫的料
I, I just ain't cut out to be a farmer or a husband.

443
00:38:23,054 --> 00:38:25,990
奈勒斯，我再也不会提起这件事…
Linus, I ain't never bringing up the subject again...

444
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:28,318
不管我会不会再见到你
...whether ever I see you or not.

445
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:29,953
这对我们大家都好
Now, it's for the best.

446
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:32,858
我希望你一切顺心，伊芙
I wish you Godspeed, Eve.

447
00:38:34,305 --> 00:38:37,834
我已经很久没对人那样说了
And I ain't said that to anybody for a long time.

448
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:15,568
我看到前面有急流，爸 白花花的浪头
I can see rapids ahead, Pa. White water.

449
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:17,031
你们看！
Look. Look.

450
00:39:17,373 --> 00:39:19,433
喔，我们一定走错叉路了
Oh, we must've taken the wrong fork.

451
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:21,535
把船停靠岸！
Let's beach her on this side.

452
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:23,141
哈维！
Harvey!

453
00:39:24,885 --> 00:39:25,943
急流！
Rapids.

454
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:28,385
前面有急流！把船靠岸！
Rapids ahead! Beach her!

455
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:30,484
把船靠岸！
Beach her!

456
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,432
稳住船身！
Hold her steady.

457
00:39:41,477 --> 00:39:42,501
拉住！
Strain!

458
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,612
爸，我们被卷进急流了！
Pa, we're in the current.

459
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:51,121
进去里面，齐克
Get inside, Zeke.

460
00:39:52,462 --> 00:39:53,759
不！我不要！
No, I don't wanna.

461
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:01,834
往直行，爸！
Straighten her, Pa.

462
00:40:04,046 --> 00:40:05,104
莉莉丝！
Lilith!

463
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:26,742
稳住！
Hold it steady!

464
00:40:29,754 --> 00:40:30,743
没办法！
I can't!

465
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:49,407
快去！快去帮爸爸！
Go on. Go on and help Pa.

466
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:51,807
我来！
I'll get it.

467
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,877
莉莉丝！莉莉丝！
Lilith! Lilith!

468
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:47,395
趴下！
Lie down!

469
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:49,803
趴下！
Lie down!

470
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:26,762
怎么回事？
What happened?

471
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,768
他们走错河道 往瀑布冲下去了
They took the wrong fork of the river and they went over the falls.

472
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,307
你可知道是哪个人家？
Did you happen to hear the name of the family?

473
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,912
普莱斯考特家族，好像是他们
Prescott, I think. Something like that.

474
00:43:51,038 --> 00:43:53,132
一旦好好安葬过他们…
As soon as they're buried decent...

475
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:56,201
我就要搭上第一艘回东部的船！
...l'm heading back East on the first boat that comes along.

476
00:43:56,313 --> 00:43:59,340
你若头脑清楚的话 你也会这么做
And if you were in your right mind, you would, too.

477
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:30,898
喔，奈勒斯…
Oh, Linus.

478
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:04,475
摇滚年代，离我远去
"Rock of ages, cleft for me

479
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:11,052
让我把自己你放在心里
"Let me hide myself in thee

480
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,462
让泪水和流血
"Let the water and the blood

481
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:23,505
从此远离
"From thy side, a healing flood

482
00:45:25,086 --> 00:45:29,388
双重医治我的罪过
"Be of sin the double cure

483
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:36,297
把我的罪恶洗净
"Cleanse me from its guilt and power."

484
00:45:55,802 --> 00:45:58,135
你陪我散步一下好吗，伊芙？
Would you walk with me a piece, Eve?

485
00:46:18,437 --> 00:46:19,495
伊芙，我…
Eve, I....

486
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:25,340
伊芙，我刚才一路划过来时 我心里想着…
Eve, all the time I was paddlin' down here I was thinkin'...

487
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,746
如果我看到你还活着 我就…
...if I found you alive, I'd--

488
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,857
你愿意和我一起去匹兹堡吗，伊芙？
Would you come to Pittsburgh with me, Eve?

489
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,295


490
00:46:39,337 --> 00:46:40,827
喔，奈勒斯… 我要留在这里
I'm stayin' right here.

491
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,335
不管怎样我都不会离开这里一步
I ain't movin' a foot one way or the other.

492
00:46:46,514 --> 00:46:48,608
能告诉我为什么吗？
Now would you explain that a little?

493
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:53,223
爸爸妈妈想到西部开辟一座农场…
Ma and Pa, they wanted a farm in the West...

494
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:56,219
他们只走到这么远
...and this is as far as they got.

495
00:46:57,632 --> 00:47:00,796
我觉得这是上帝要农场搭盖的地方
Seems to me this is where the Lord wanted the farm to be.

496
00:47:01,137 --> 00:47:04,164
可是你的弟弟山姆受伤那么严重 冬天就要来了…
But your brother, Sam, he's bad hurt, and winter's comin'--

497
00:47:04,242 --> 00:47:06,643
再怎么说都没用 我非这么做不可
There's no sense talkin' about it. I'm gonna do it.

498
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,172
伊芙，你这样根本不合理啊
Eve, you just ain't makin' much sense.

499
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:14,382
我想有半数前来西部的人 都不是按牌理出牌的
Half the people that come West don't make much sense, I reckon.

500
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:20,622
好吧
All right.

501
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:22,859
好吧
All right.

502
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,508
老天，你真是个意志坚定的女人
By golly, you're a strong-minded woman.

503
00:47:30,483 --> 00:47:33,510
我向你保证 那是我最后一次看野兽了
I reckon I seen that varmint for the last time.

504
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:24,361
迈向西部之路并不比 追求真爱来得平顺
The westward course was no smoother than that of true love.

505
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:29,665
不仅得面对残酷大自然的考验 另外还有战争的阻碍
Not only the hard hand of nature was against it, but the impediment of war.

506
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:33,645
美墨边境地带一直不断出现战事
Trouble over land smoldered along the Mexican border.

507
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:38,255
并不是所有美国人都赞成战争 包括伊利诺州的众议员亚柏林肯
Not all Americans were for war, including Congressman Abe Lincoln of Illinois.

508
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:40,455
但战事仍爆发了 到最后…
But a war did break out...

509
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:43,890
许多带着浓厚西班牙色彩地名的新领地
...and in the end vast new territories came into the Union...

510
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:45,764
被纳入联邦政府的一部分…
...along with their rich Spanish names:

511
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:49,332
里欧格蓝德…圣塔菲… 亚柏考基…艾尔帕索
Rio Grande, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, El Paso...

512
00:48:49,975 --> 00:48:52,604
还有其中最出名的是…加州
...and most glittering of all, California...

513
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:57,679
以一本十五世纪小说里 一处充满珍珠与黄金神秘小岛为命名的
...named after a mythical island of pearls and gold in a 15th century novel.

514
00:48:57,988 --> 00:49:00,457
而现在1848年…
Here, in 1848...

515
00:49:00,893 --> 00:49:04,661
在萨特磨坊 有个人无意间在沟底处…
...at Sutter's Mill, a man found something he wasn't even looking for...

516
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:06,359
发现了一样东西
...at the bottom of a ditch.

517
00:49:06,435 --> 00:49:09,667
他发现这个东西的消息传遍各地…
And the cry of his discovery was heard clear across the continent...

518
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,835
波士顿…纽约…莎凡那…甚至横越大洋
...in Boston, New York, Savannah, and across the oceans...

519
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,535


520
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:14,844
至伦敦…巴黎…柏林
...in London, Paris, Berlin.

521
00:49:15,316 --> 00:49:17,979
然而这场黄金热最疯狂的地点
But nowhere was the clamor of gold...

522
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:21,318
就是在圣路易斯市…
...heard more eagerly than in St. Louis...

523
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,094
该地是全世界最忙碌的皮毛交易中心
...the busiest fur trading center in the world...

524
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:28,325
是纽约以西最喧嚣，最态意妄为 最骄气的城市
...and the noisiest, bawdiest, most uppity town west of New York.

525
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,050
（明星歌舞团）

526
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,261
（登台演唱者：莉莉普莱斯考特）

527
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:57,174
"Boys, hold your hosses

528
00:49:57,448 --> 00:49:59,075
"We're still the bosses

529
00:49:59,118 --> 00:50:00,585
"Please hold your hosses

530
00:50:00,654 --> 00:50:02,486
"Till we get...

531
00:50:02,925 --> 00:50:05,724
"...to the dance! "

532
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,412
我说不超过三号
I say there's no more than three.

533
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:23,620
- 六号 - 六号？
Six? It's all that lace that fooled you. I still say three.

534
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,937
是那些蕾丝的关系 我说是三号

535
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:26,092
克里夫可是女人衬裙专家
Watch him. I hear Cleve's an expert on petticoats.

536
00:50:26,161 --> 00:50:27,628
反正你永远没办法证实
Anyway, you can never prove it.

537
00:50:27,663 --> 00:50:29,791
咱们扑克牌局要迟到了
Gentlemen, we're going to be late for that poker game.

538
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:32,597
我刚让你花了那么多钱 吃晚餐…
I've just stuck you for the most expensive dinner in St. Louis...

539
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:34,731
我还想再捞你一笔 我赌一百元那件衬裙不超过六号
...and I don't mind sticking you a little bit deeper.

540
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:36,709
我赌一百元那件衬裙不超过六号
I'll lay you $100 if it's no less than six.

541
00:50:36,777 --> 00:50:39,440
- 你要如何证实？ - 到后台去查啊
-How will you prove it? -Go backstage and find out.

542
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:40,948
- 我和你一起去
If I go back and check with you.

543
00:50:41,018 --> 00:50:42,110
- 可以
Fair enough.

544
00:50:50,032 --> 00:50:51,124
第二个女孩
Second girl.

545
00:50:55,574 --> 00:50:57,600
- 普莱斯考特小姐？普莱斯考特小姐？ - 等一下
-Miss Prescott? -Later.

546
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,268
这事挺重要的
It's rather important.

547
00:51:00,215 --> 00:51:01,807
每次都说很重要
It's always important.

548
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:04,479
愈老的家伙事情愈重要
The older they are, the more important it gets.

549
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:07,023
普莱斯考特小姐 我是海蓝席贝瑞…
Miss Prescott, please. I'm Hylan Seabury...

550
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:09,995
强纳森布鲁克斯的律师
...attorney in the matter of Jonathan Brooks.

551
00:51:10,865 --> 00:51:12,595
你不知道他是谁？
He means nothing to you?

552
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:14,231
那糟老头？
That old goat?

553
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,871
那你一定对他具有某种意义 普莱斯考特小姐
You must've meant something to him, Miss Prescott.

554
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,000
- 为什么？ - 他的遗嘱里有提到你
-Why? -You're included in his will.

555
00:51:19,078 --> 00:51:22,880
当然，你得亲自去加州取得这份遗产
Of course, you'll have to make the trip to California to claim the bequest.

556
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,215
我才不要去加州
Well, now, I wouldn't go to California...

557
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:28,223
就算约翰亚斯特把整个旧金山留给我
...if John Jacob Astor left me San Francisco.

558
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:31,060
我想亚斯特先生在那里并没有财产
I don't think Mr. Astor had holdings there.

559
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,727
无论如何，布鲁克斯先生物产的收入 可是不容轻忽的
However, the yield from Mr. Brooks' property is not to be scorned.

560
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:35,963
- 什么收入？
Yield of what?

561
00:51:36,038 --> 00:51:38,064
- 黄金，普莱斯考特小姐，黄金
Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.

562
00:51:39,142 --> 00:51:40,940
- 黄金？ - 正是
-Gold? -Precisely.

563
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:43,112
你拥有一座金矿，普莱斯考特小姐
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.

564
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,153
首周便收入三千五百元
It yielded $3,500 the very first week.

565
00:51:47,122 --> 00:51:48,589
金矿？
Gold mine?

567
00:51:54,233 --> 00:51:56,031
这个…我… 那个可爱的糟老头
That sweet old goat!

568
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,702
老天…

569
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,965
呃…

570
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:17,666
真是意想不到的惊喜
This is an unexpected pleasure.

571
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:18,795
- 钱呢？ - 钱？
Where's the money?

572
00:52:18,905 --> 00:52:19,872
钱？
Money?

573
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,007
Money?

574
00:52:21,243 --> 00:52:25,045
喔，对了…你指的是 我们之前的小小协议
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course, to our little agreement.

575
00:52:26,049 --> 00:52:27,984
先拿出一百元吧…
One hundred to start you off...

576
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:30,617
另外还有我赢钱的部分
...and my share of the winnings.

577
00:52:31,692 --> 00:52:35,960
真不好意思…那一百元已经没有了
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report that the $100 no longer exists.

578
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:40,171
那一百元…我可以向你保证…
That $100, I assure you...

579
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,972
将是你有史以来做过最棒的投资
...will turn out to be the best investment you have ever made.

580
00:52:45,046 --> 00:52:46,776
我有几个计昼，各位
I have plans, gentlemen...

581
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,185
是你们从未想过的计昼
...beyond your wildest dreams.

582
00:52:50,188 --> 00:52:53,853
我要替你们赢来一座金矿的股份
I'm gonna earn you a piece of a gold mine.

583
00:52:54,328 --> 00:52:55,352
金矿
Gold mine!

584
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:58,697
你才不可能会赚到什么钱
You ain't gonna earn nothin'!

585
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:01,894
你永远都不成气候 做不了任何事…
You ain't gonna be nothin', you ain't gonna do nothin'...

586
00:53:01,973 --> 00:53:03,999
除非你在明早之前 给我们一百元！
...unless we get that $100 back by the morning.

587
00:53:04,043 --> 00:53:06,035
格兰姆斯，你这话不是认真的吧
Grimes, you don't mean that.

588
00:53:06,747 --> 00:53:08,682
- 你可别干掉会下金蛋的鹅
You're gonna kill off the golden goose.

589
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,480
- 随便你怎么讲，先生
Call it what you want, mister.

590
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:12,050
我们会等着收钱的
We'll be waitin'.

591
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,211
（加州一奥勒冈 篷车队）

592
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:39,757
密苏里州的独立市是 移民者通往各地的起点
Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off point for emigrants from everywhere.

593
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:44,098
脚踏实地，敬畏上帝 前往奥勒冈的务农人家…
Solid, God-fearing families bound for the farmlands of Oregon...

594
00:53:45,074 --> 00:53:50,013
以及前往加州淘金 梦想一夜致富的冒险者
...and get-rich-quick adventurers raced for the gold of California.

595
00:53:52,954 --> 00:53:54,012
试试看
Try it.

596
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:01,399
- 你有篷车吧？
You got a wagon, I suppose?

597
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:02,763
- 我可以买一辆
I can get one.

598
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:04,131
有人帮你拉？
And a team to pull it?

599
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:05,969
我需要的一切都有了
I can get everything I need.

600
00:54:06,308 --> 00:54:07,798
- 你有丈夫吗？
You got a husband?

601
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:09,538
- 我单身，摩根先生
I'm single, Mr. Morgan.

602
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:11,775
没有旅伴？
No travelin' companion?

603
00:54:12,384 --> 00:54:14,182
- 没，我一个人
No, I'm travelin' alone.

604
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:15,914
- 我的篷车队可不行这样
Not on my wagon train.

605
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:19,391
单身女人会引来男人妄想
Alone and single brings out the deviltry in a man.

606
00:54:19,462 --> 00:54:22,830
把他们弄得六神无主 他们已经够狂野了
Gets 'em all worked up and they're wild enough already.

607
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:25,334
我不打算和别人打交道，摩根先生
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.

608
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:28,037
喔，像你这种女人？
A woman of your sort?

609
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:33,814
有一天你会发现自己惹了麻烦 才苦恼不晓得到底要找谁算帐
One day you'd find yourself in trouble and there'd be hell to pay just figurin' out who.

610
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:36,247
你说什么，摩根先生？
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?

611
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:41,485
你这女人个性挺泼辣的嘛 我喜欢个性强的女人
Well, now, ain't you the feisty one! I like spirit in a woman.

612
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:46,033


613
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,428
你这张藏在妆底下的脸 还挺好看的
You got a pretty face under that powder, too.

614
00:54:46,972 --> 00:54:49,874
在这层衣服底下 应是一副美好结实的身子，我想
And a fine, sturdy body under them clothes, I wager.

615
00:54:52,981 --> 00:54:55,280
有个女人姓克雷格 艾姬克雷格
There's a woman named Clegg, Aggie Clegg.

616
00:54:56,053 --> 00:54:57,645
你去找她吧
Why don't you go see her?

617
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,127
谢谢
Thanks.

618
00:55:16,886 --> 00:55:18,148
我告诉你了，不要！
I told you, no.

619
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,582
我打算在这场旅途上找个丈夫
I was hoping to make this trip with a husband.

620
00:55:22,094 --> 00:55:23,926
上周差点找到一个
Nearly got one last week.

621
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:27,159
我听说在加州每四十个男人 只有一个女人
Look, I hear there's 40 men to every woman in California.

622
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:29,570
- 克雷格小姐，我愿意付你钱 - 我不需要钱
Miss Clegg, I'd be willing to pay you.

623
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,439
我需要的是男人
I don't need money, I need a man.

624
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:36,040
任何男人都行
Any man.

625
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:44,557
早安，女士们
Mornin', ladies.

626
00:55:45,998 --> 00:55:47,295
今早天气真好
Beautiful mornin'.

627
00:55:48,737 --> 00:55:52,105
请问你是不是 莉莉普莱斯考特小姐？
Would you, by any chance, happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?

628
00:55:52,743 --> 00:55:55,042
除非你脑子搞不清楚
Not unless you got a big imagination.

629
00:55:55,113 --> 00:55:57,446
那一定就是你罗
Then, you must be the lady in question.

630
00:55:58,151 --> 00:56:00,586
克里夫凡伟伦，普莱斯考特小姐 听从你吩咐
Cleve van Valen, Miss Prescott, at your service.

631
00:56:00,655 --> 00:56:03,352
从这里到加州 敝人听从你差遣
At your every command from here to California.

632
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,986
谢谢你
Well, thank you, but whatever you're offering, I don't need.

633
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:08,073
不过，你提供的任何服务 我都不需要

634
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:10,402
或许你不了解…
Perhaps you don't understand.

635
00:56:10,504 --> 00:56:13,998
是的，我了解 对于识别骗子我特别在行
Yes, I do. I know a tinhorn when I see one.

636
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:15,671
普莱斯考特小姐…
Miss Prescott!

637
00:56:16,045 --> 00:56:19,174
我是真心想替你做事 做一份事，拿一分钱
I'm offerin' you an honest days' work for an honest days' pay.

638
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,618
再见，凡伟伦先生 再见
Goodbye, Mr. van Valen. Goodbye.

639
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:26,591
很荣幸认识你，克雷格小姐
Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you, Miss Clegg.

640
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:31,068
请容我说，我从未过过女人 拥有一头如此美丽的秀发
May I say I have never seen a woman with more beautiful hair.

641
00:56:32,071 --> 00:56:34,165
我想那头发如果挂在…
What a prize catch it will make...

642
00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:37,044
印地安人腰上一定很好看
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.

643
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,011
如此美女独自在荒野里
Beauty, alone in the wilderness...

644
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,151
谁来保护你呢？
...and who's to protect you?

645
00:56:42,621 --> 00:56:43,781
没人
No one.

646
00:56:44,057 --> 00:56:47,722
每个人都自顾不暇了
Not one person won't be looking after himself.

647
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:52,024
好吧…
Well....

648
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,737
日安，女士们
Good day, ladies.

649
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:57,368
…日安
Good day.

650
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,452
从来都没有人那样对我说过
Nobody ever said that to me before.

651
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:06,413
说什么？
What?

652
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:10,292
说我有一头美丽的秀发
That I had such...such beautiful hair.

653
00:57:14,271 --> 00:57:15,761
你知道吗？
You know something?

654
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:20,206
我感觉你可以吸引来许多男人
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men like fish to the bait.

655
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:24,251
或许我可以顺便挑中一个
Maybe I can catch one of them while they swim by.

656
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,722
我愿意当你的伙伴
You got yourself a partner.

657
00:57:28,627 --> 00:57:29,651
谢谢你
Thank you.

658
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,230
怎么样？
How's it, Ben?

659
00:57:34,103 --> 00:57:37,768
从这里一切净空 下一段路小心一个小泥坑就是了
It's all clear up through here. Look for a little mudhole up through the next pocket.

660
00:57:37,808 --> 00:57:39,800
- 有多远？ - 喔，大约八分之一哩路吧
-How far? -Maybe half or a quarter.

661
00:57:39,878 --> 00:57:43,178
- 好的，谢谢 - 在那山脊上可登高望远
-Well, thanks. -Looks a little higher up on that ridge.

662
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:47,118
上面有个水洞 差不多半哩，咱们往那里去
There's a water hole up there about half a mile. Let's head for it.

663
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:56,763
前面半哩处有个水洞
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

664
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:02,744
嘿，你在拉车
Hey, you're drivin'.

665
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,811
我是在农场里长大的
I was raised on a farm.

666
00:58:10,193 --> 00:58:12,526
前面半哩处有个水洞
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

667
00:58:50,323 --> 00:58:51,517
嘿，艾姬？
Hey, Aggie....

668
00:58:52,926 --> 00:58:54,359
- 这个你要吗？ - 当然
Can you use these?

669
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:56,694
谢谢
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

670
00:59:10,722 --> 00:59:11,746
女士们
Ladies.

671
00:59:21,672 --> 00:59:23,264
听从你吩咐
At your service.

672
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:25,303
我以为已经把你给甩了
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.

673
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:29,441
我无法想像你们俩独自上路 没有我从旁相助
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of you two makin' this trip without my help.

674
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,817
我若听到你有个三长两短
If I was to hear later on that somethin' happened to you...

675
00:59:31,888 --> 00:59:33,446
我一定不会原谅我自己的
...l'd never forgive myself.

676
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:35,049
你一个人跑一百哩？
You came 100 miles alone?

677
00:59:35,327 --> 00:59:39,663
我没计算路程，摩根先生 不过你说了就算
Well, I had no way of countin' the miles, Mr. Morgan, but I'll take your word for it.

678
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,965
那你得再跑个一百哩，先生 往回走
You've got another 100, mister. Goin' back.

679
00:59:42,004 --> 00:59:45,441
我说过，当篷车坏掉时 我要懂得修车的人…
I told ya, when a wagon breaks down, I want men who can fix it...

680
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,738
不是赌车子能撑多久的人
...not bet how long it'll take.

681
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:48,803
你不会想就这样把我赶跑吧？
You don't mean you'll turn me out?

682
00:59:49,116 --> 00:59:51,813
让我沦落入野蛮印地安人手中？
Pass me adrift at the mercy of savage Indians?

683
00:59:51,853 --> 00:59:54,084
如果你再不走 我就把你…
If you don't get movin', I'll cast you adrift--

684
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,623
我知道你想要讲什么，先生
I appeal to your sportin' instinct, sir.

685
00:59:57,362 --> 01:00:00,491
我要和你打赌 我将留在这车队里
I'm prepared to wager you that I stay with this train.

686
01:00:00,566 --> 01:00:01,533
- 你要赌，来啊！
Well, you got a wager.

687
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,332
- 等一下！等一下！
Wait a minute.

688
01:00:03,738 --> 01:00:05,707
是这样的，我雇请了这个人
The fact is, I hired this man.

689
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:08,011
我们愿意替他作保
We'll put up his stake.

690
01:00:10,582 --> 01:00:12,414
是这样吗，普莱斯考特小姐？
Is that right, Miss Prescott?

691
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:14,043
克雷格小姐说了算数
If Miss Clegg says so.

692
01:00:25,773 --> 01:00:26,831
小姐…
Ma'am...

693
01:00:27,943 --> 01:00:29,775
我将毕生感激不尽
...l'll be forever grateful.

694
01:00:33,552 --> 01:00:35,612
我这就去卸下我的行李
Now, I'll unpack my gear.

695
01:00:39,795 --> 01:00:41,991
艾姬莎，你疯啦？
Agatha, have you gone crazy?

696
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,636
他说他想老老实实做事
He says he's a man wantin' to do an honest days work.

697
01:00:46,773 --> 01:00:49,470
他可以的，我跟你保证
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.

698
01:00:50,812 --> 01:00:53,941
最后一台篷车 快点跟上
Hey, you men on that last wagon, keep up that slack.

699
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,109
快点跟上
Keep it up.

700
01:00:56,222 --> 01:00:58,748
大家往前走，继续往前走！
Get that team movin'. Keep 'em movin' there.

701
01:01:02,231 --> 01:01:04,496
别让绳索垂下去！
Don't let those lines sag.

702
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,831
跟上队伍！跟上队伍！
Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.

703
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,913
大家继续往前进！
Keep those teams movin'.

704
01:01:16,753 --> 01:01:18,015
继续往前进！
Keep 'em movin'.

705
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:21,116
别让绳索垂下去！
Don't let those lines sag.

706
01:01:22,696 --> 01:01:24,688
队伍中间的人 继续往前进！
You on that middle team, keep 'em movin'.

707
01:01:35,549 --> 01:01:37,541
- 进去！ - 在这里，爸
Get in there.

708
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,904
进去！

709
01:01:40,157 --> 01:01:42,524
进去！进去！骡子！
Get in there, mule.

710
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:20,717
我受到如此多关心真的很感动 普莱斯考特小姐
I'm just overwhelmed by all this attention, Miss Prescott.

711
01:02:29,201 --> 01:02:30,759
我要向你坦白…
I want to confess...

712
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,969
关于替你工作的事 我对你们撒谎
...I have lied about why I wanted to work for you.

713
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,638
我知道
I know.

714
01:02:39,117 --> 01:02:42,246
真正的原因是 我爱上了你
The real reason is, of course, that I'm in love with you.

715
01:02:42,956 --> 01:02:45,050
先别说话…， 那是实话
Now, it's the truth.

717
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,987
打从我第一眼看到你
From the first moment I saw you...

718
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,960
我就知道我不能没有你
...l've known that I couldn't live without you.

719
01:02:53,372 --> 01:02:56,604
我可不想害你活不成，凡伟伦先生
I'd hate to be the cause of your death, Mr. van Valen.

720
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,942
我这话可不是随便说说 普莱斯考特小姐
I don't speak lightly, Miss Prescott.

721
01:02:59,983 --> 01:03:03,648
我已准备好当个负责任且忠实的好丈夫
I'm prepared to assume the responsibilities of a faithful husband.

722
01:03:04,424 --> 01:03:07,918
喔，那你是否已准备承担责任…
Oh, and are you ready to assume the responsibilities...

723
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:10,261
掌管我的财产呢，凡伟伦先生？
...of my property, too, Mr. van Valen?

724
01:03:11,435 --> 01:03:14,964
真的？什么样的财产？
Really? What, what kind of property?

726
01:03:16,242 --> 01:03:17,869
黄金，凡伟伦先生
Gold, Mr. van Valen.

727
01:03:18,312 --> 01:03:21,009
就我所知，有上吨的黄金
Gold by the ton from what I understand.

728
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,152
闪亮，澄黄，耀眼的黄金
Bright, yellow, shiny gold.


730
01:03:28,328 --> 01:03:30,058
哇！我不晓得呢
I had no idea.

731
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,128
- 我想也是
I'm sure you hadn't.

732
01:03:33,202 --> 01:03:35,137
- 普莱斯考特小姐，我真的是…
Miss Prescott, I really mean--

733
01:03:35,673 --> 01:03:37,038
艾姬莎来了
Here comes Agatha.

734
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:39,903
如果你必须向人求婚…
If you must propose to somebody...

735
01:03:40,213 --> 01:03:42,842
我建议你向她下跪求婚
...I suggest you get on your knees to her.

736
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:45,213
更何况，她有一头美丽的秀发
Besides, she has beautiful hair.

737
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:49,185
瞧瞧他们…
Look at 'em.

738
01:03:49,928 --> 01:03:52,864
他们好像准备要埋葬死人一样
You'd think they was gettin' ready to bury somebody.

739
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:55,061
难道咱们还不够苦闷吗？
Ain't we worn down enough as it is?

740
01:03:56,072 --> 01:03:58,303
那咱们来激发点士气
Well, let's wake 'em up.

741
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:04,248
听着，各位…
Listen, everybody.

742
01:04:05,253 --> 01:04:08,884
来吧，每个人都来
"Come on along, everybody come along

743
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:12,429
这里有明亮的月亮和星光
"While that moon am shinin' bright

744
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:16,896
来吧，放开你的嗓门一起歌唱
"Come on along And raise your voice in song

745
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:20,272
今天晚我们要骚动起来
"We're gonna raise a ruckus tonight

746
01:04:21,378 --> 01:04:25,009
我们没时间坐着，一起骚动起来
"It ain't no time to sit 'n brood Raise a ruckus tonight

747
01:04:25,284 --> 01:04:29,188
调动你的热情一起骚动起来
"It's time to strike a lively mood Raise a ruckus tonight

748
01:04:29,424 --> 01:04:33,260
雷兹，去把你的班卓琴弹起来让大家热情骚动起来
"Go and get that old banjo Raise a ruckus tonight

749
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:37,061
只需要拍着节奏让你的脚和身体骚动起来
"Just pat your foot and tap your toe Raise a ruckus tonight

750
01:04:37,136 --> 01:04:41,438
你听到了我说的吗？来吧，孩子们，来吧
"Do ya hear me? Come on along, little children, come along

751
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:44,841
这里有明亮的月亮和星光
"While that moon am shinin' bright

752
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:49,011
过来，把这把洗衣板当琴弦弹
"Come along now and tune up that string And let that banjo ring

753
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:52,581
今天晚我们要骚动起来
"We're gonna raise a ruckus tonight! "

754
01:04:53,228 --> 01:04:54,855
现在唱出来吧！
Sing it out, now!

755
01:05:23,509 --> 01:05:26,502
这样才对嘛！士气激昂！
That's the spirit. That's the way to feel.

756
01:05:35,662 --> 01:05:37,289
喔，你好哇，摩根先生！
Oh, hiya, Mr. Morgan!

757
01:05:51,286 --> 01:05:53,278
艾姬…午餐吃的
Aggie, for lunch.

758
01:05:54,058 --> 01:05:56,186
谢谢，好一篓肥鱼
Thanks. Nice not to fish.

759
01:06:04,908 --> 01:06:06,398
什么事，摩根先生？
What is it, Mr. Morgan?

760
01:06:07,278 --> 01:06:09,975
普莱斯考特小姐，我一直在想…
Miss Prescott, I've been thinking.

761
01:06:15,091 --> 01:06:17,993
你是我走遍各地 见过最美丽的女人
Wet or dry, you're the handsomest woman I ever did see.

762
01:06:18,463 --> 01:06:20,329
个性活泼，身材健美
Spirit and a fine sturdy body.

763
01:06:21,468 --> 01:06:23,960
绝佳组合，普莱斯考特小姐
It's a noble combination, Miss Prescott.

764
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:28,141
我想生孩子对你而言应该就像 滚木头一样简单
Why, for you, child-bearin' would come as easy as rolling off a log.

765
01:06:30,415 --> 01:06:34,012
我还宁愿滚木头呢，摩根先生
Well, I think I'd rather roll off a log, Mr. Morgan.

766
01:06:35,022 --> 01:06:37,651
小姐，我告诉你 你绝对是生孩子的料
Ma'am, I'm tellin' you, you got the build for it.

767
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:39,717
我要你当我的老婆
I want you for my wife.

768
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:43,591
我在麻塞德有一座牧牛农场
I've got a cattle ranch just below the Merced.

769
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:46,966
我将在那里安顿下来 衣食无缺
I'll be settlin' down there, fit and proper.

770
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:51,173
我相信你是很衣食无缺 摩根先生
I'm sure you're very fit and proper, Mr. Morgan.

771
01:06:52,115 --> 01:06:53,241
那么…
Well, then...

772
01:06:53,684 --> 01:06:56,620
你不可能嫁给比我更好的人
...you just couldn't do no better than marryin' me.

773
01:06:57,123 --> 01:07:00,218
我们可以很快地组个美满家庭 生儿育女
Why, we'd have ourselves a fine family in no time at all.

774
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:03,325
我相信是可以的
I believe that.

775
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:07,330
我很抱歉，摩根先生…
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan, but...

776
01:07:08,341 --> 01:07:09,774
我无法接受你的求婚
...I can't accept your proposal.

777
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:11,069
为什么不？
Why not?

778
01:07:12,381 --> 01:07:13,370
Well....

779
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:16,678
女人喜欢听点甜言蜜语的话
A woman likes to hear something a little more inviting.

780
01:07:18,056 --> 01:07:21,049
那不就是我的意思？ 对你甜言蜜语
Well, ain't that what I've been doin'? Invitin' you?

781
01:07:21,595 --> 01:07:24,224
请你和我分享我的人生 普莱斯考特小姐
Invitin' you to share my life, Miss Prescott.

782
01:07:27,305 --> 01:07:28,772
很抱歉，摩根先生…
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.

783
01:07:31,277 --> 01:07:33,246
是不是有别的事情？
It's somethin' else, ain't it?

784
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,647
一定有别的事情困扰着你
Must be somethin' else naggin' at you.

786
01:07:40,258 --> 01:07:42,727
好吧… 我不会让它阻止我的 普莱斯考特小姐
I don't aim to let it stop me, Miss Prescott.

787
01:07:44,365 --> 01:07:45,855
我向你保证
You can count on that.

788
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:47,598
他想要什么？
What did he want?

789
01:07:49,473 --> 01:07:50,565
孩子
Children.

790
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:52,834
孩子？
Children?

791
01:07:53,512 --> 01:07:54,706
真是的…
Well, I'll be--

792
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:58,744
他干嘛不找对的人呢？
Why didn't he come shopping at the right store?

793
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:43,653
- 我押这些 - 这个嘛…
I'll take a look.

794
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:47,325
咱们是玩小赌本吗？
Gentlemen, are we pikers?

795
01:08:47,431 --> 01:08:50,595
我要再加筹码 还要再押这把好枪…
I'm gonna see and I'm gonna raise this fine pistol.

796
01:08:50,703 --> 01:08:53,298
伦敦制，专门打熊用的枪
London-made and loaded for bear.

797
01:08:53,841 --> 01:08:55,673
我也要参加一份
I'll take part of that bet.

798
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,987
我说过我绝不允许你搞这种勾当…
I told you I wouldn't stand for you fleecin' any--

799
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:10,357
夏安族
Cheyennes.

800
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:13,970
我们寡不敌众 必须赶紧逃跑
There's too many. We'll have to make a run for it.

801
01:09:14,207 --> 01:09:15,469
用篷车根本跑不过他们
You can't outrun them with the wagons.

802
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:17,806
一开跑之后 整个队伍要散开
The minute you get movin' cut your lead teams loose.

803
01:09:17,879 --> 01:09:19,210
- 你疯啦？ - 快点，动作快！
Have you gone crazy?

804
01:09:20,349 --> 01:09:22,215
他们要的是我们的货 不是我们的人
Chances are they want our stock more than us.

805
01:09:22,252 --> 01:09:24,380
你是赌徒没错吧？ 好了，咱们走吧
You're a gambler, ain't you? All right, let's get movin'.

806
01:09:42,384 --> 01:09:43,942
大家凑紧一点！
Keep 'em closed up there.

807
01:09:55,939 --> 01:09:57,703
我不知道该如何解开它们
I don't know how to unhook them.

808
01:11:02,377 --> 01:11:04,072
克里夫，小心！
Cleve, watch out!


810
01:12:06,544 --> 01:12:08,171
乔！载我一程！
Joe, pick me up.

811
01:12:54,754 --> 01:12:56,723
天一破晓我们就出发
We'll be movin' at daybreak.

812
01:12:57,158 --> 01:12:59,992
我带几个人去看能不能找到他
I'll take a few men and see if we can find him.

813
01:13:00,162 --> 01:13:02,688
帮他好好做一场基督徒的葬礼仪式
Give him a decent, Christian burial.

814
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:12,741
有人来了！有人来了！
Someone's comin'! Someone's comin'!

815
01:13:57,687 --> 01:14:01,455
这车子我可以租你一天一块钱 还可以派人手随同
I can let you have this rig for $1 a day and I'll give you a good team.

816
01:14:01,693 --> 01:14:03,457
- 明天早上来取 - 好的
-Pick it up in the morning. -Fine.

817
01:14:03,696 --> 01:14:05,995
请问布鲁克斯家往哪里走？
Could you tell me the way to the Brook's claim?

818
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:08,366
就在河边
Well, the claims are down by the river.

819
01:14:08,904 --> 01:14:10,166
- 我该走哪条路？
Which road should I take?

820
01:14:10,207 --> 01:14:12,301
- 只有一条路，沿着河走
Only one road, along the river.

821
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:14,302
- 谢谢 - 不客气
-Thank you. -Sure welcome.

822
01:14:28,836 --> 01:14:30,828
我们要找赫金斯先生
We're looking for a Mr. Huggins.

823
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,434
我就是
You found him.

824
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:40,117
这位是莉莉丝普莱斯考特
This is Miss Lilith Prescott.

825
01:14:40,755 --> 01:14:41,744
我想也是
I figured.

826
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:44,218
他们说你是个美人
They told me you was a real looker.

827
01:14:45,262 --> 01:14:48,722
这片地都是你的了 正如布鲁克斯声明的
It's all here for you. Just the way Mr. Brooks staked it out.

828
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:50,799
从前大概有二十人在工作
Must have had 20 men workin' on it.

829
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:54,000
那现在人呢？ 是谁在挖黄金呢？
Where are they now? Who's digging the gold?

830
01:14:54,109 --> 01:14:58,047
黄金？我和米莉来这里之前 从未见过如此上等货
Gold? I ain't never seen a better grade since I come here with Millie.

831
01:14:58,983 --> 01:15:00,884
只有一点点
But just a pocket, though.

832
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,489
整个庞大工程却只挖到一点点
The whole shebang, nothin' but a pocket.

833
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,887
喔，我们总共赚了四千二百元
Oh, we cleared $4,200 before it played out.

834
01:15:08,164 --> 01:15:09,928
关于那四千二百元…
Now, about that $4,200....

835
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:13,267
布鲁克斯先生在心脏病发作之前 化掉了三千元
Mr. Brooks, he spent three before his heart give out.

836
01:15:13,339 --> 01:15:15,865
我花了六百元买一座铜棺材
I put up $600 for a brass-handled casket.

837
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:19,237
剩下的钱就算是 你欠我帮忙看管这地方
I figure the rest you owe me for sittin' on your claim.

838
01:15:23,822 --> 01:15:26,314
小姐，这样才公平，是吧？
Oh, miss, I mean, that's only fair, ain't it?

839
01:15:26,994 --> 01:15:28,461
你是不是这么认为…？
I mean, wouldn't you...?

840
01:15:35,874 --> 01:15:37,341
好奇怪的一对
Funny pair, all right.

841
01:15:59,879 --> 01:16:01,141
那你们呢？
How about you boys over here?

842
01:16:01,415 --> 01:16:02,905
快来看全新的表演节目
Come and see the brand new attraction.

843
01:16:02,984 --> 01:16:06,045
超级刺激，超级性感 请进吧，各位先生
It's exciting and sensational. Step right in, gentlemen.

844
01:16:07,325 --> 01:16:10,489
"Are you wanted for life 'Cause you left your poor wife

845
01:16:10,562 --> 01:16:13,555
"When she caught you sniffin' a cork, My friend

846
01:16:13,868 --> 01:16:16,269
"Hey, what was your name in New York

847
01:16:18,142 --> 01:16:20,509
"Oh, what was your name in the East

848
01:16:21,147 --> 01:16:23,548
"And how recently was you released

849
01:16:24,217 --> 01:16:27,483
"Are you ridin' the rails 'Cause you held up the mails

850
01:16:27,589 --> 01:16:30,423
"Or was it the females you held, you beast

851
01:16:30,594 --> 01:16:33,155
"Oh, what was your name in the East

852
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:37,664
"Oh, what was your name in the states

853
01:16:38,073 --> 01:16:40,702
"Though you suffered the cruelest of fates

854
01:16:41,144 --> 01:16:42,908
"Way out here in the West

855
01:16:42,947 --> 01:16:44,380
"Everybody's a guest

856
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:47,443
"So line up and fill up your plates, My friend

857
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:51,684
"Whoever you was in the states! "

858
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:23,469
普莱斯考特小姐？
Miss Prescott.

859
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:25,476
哈罗，摩根先生
Hello, Mr. Morgan.

860
01:17:25,681 --> 01:17:28,651
这里有点挤，不方便请你进来坐
I'd invite you in, but it's a little cramped.

861
01:17:41,807 --> 01:17:44,470
像你这么好条件的女人 不应该过这种日子
This is no life for a fine woman like you.

862
01:17:47,716 --> 01:17:49,742
我听说你的金矿没着落
I heard your mine was played out.

863
01:17:51,722 --> 01:17:53,714
可是你那个爱玩的朋友呢？
But, where's your fancy friend?

864
01:17:54,059 --> 01:17:55,026
克里夫？
Cleve?

865
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:58,663
听说他跑去汉镇了
The last I heard, he was in Hangtown.

866
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:03,298
你是说那个没出息的人 丢下你跑掉了？
You mean that no-good went off and left you?

867
01:18:06,178 --> 01:18:07,736
他丢下我跑掉了
He went off and left me...

868
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:12,718
但我不认为他没出息
...but I don't agree that he's no good.

869
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:15,726
克里夫不过只是克里夫 没什么
Cleve is Cleve, that's all.

870
01:18:19,299 --> 01:18:21,734
你真是令人捉摸不透的女人 普莱斯考特小姐
You're a perplexin' woman, Miss Prescott.

871
01:18:23,072 --> 01:18:24,767
当一只臭鼬需要被杀死时…
When a skunk needs killin'...

872
01:18:25,776 --> 01:18:28,712
怎么能说臭鼬不过只是臭鼬
...it ain't enough just to say a skunk's a skunk.

873
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,789
摩根先生

874
01:18:31,352 --> 01:18:33,753
我这一生总是梦想嫁给有钱人
All my life I wanted to marry a rich husband.

875
01:18:35,491 --> 01:18:38,359
我难道能怪克里夫只想娶有钱老婆？
Can I blame Cleve for wantin' to marry a rich wife?

876
01:18:41,201 --> 01:18:44,103
我们俩都出自贫穷家庭…
Both of us may have been born for the poor house...

877
01:18:45,607 --> 01:18:47,838
但我们却都不甘于贫穷
...but we're not the kind to like it.

878
01:18:49,313 --> 01:18:53,684
你所说的这番话是出自内心 还是你随口说说的？告诉我实话
You believe all this you've been sayin', or is it just words? Now, tell me the truth.

879
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:53,812


880
01:18:57,393 --> 01:18:58,621
实情是…
The truth is...

881
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:02,522
克里夫和我无法光靠爱情过日子
...Cleve and I couldn't live alone just on love...

882
01:19:03,703 --> 01:19:05,398
我们活不了五分钟
...not for five minutes.

883
01:19:05,839 --> 01:19:10,403
那么你已经回答了我在两千哩路上 不停问我自己的问题
Then you've answered the question I've been asking for better than 2,000 miles.

884
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:14,915
我有一间你见过最大的农场
I've got the biggest ranch you ever did see.

885
01:19:15,154 --> 01:19:17,146
大到一整天都逛不尽
You can't ride across it in a day.

886
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:21,190
那些土地很快将换成大把钞票
That land's gonna mean money sooner than you think.

887
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,858
你想要个有钱丈夫…
You want a rich husband...

888
01:19:26,739 --> 01:19:28,503
他就在你面前
...you're lookin' at him.

889
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:39,885
你什么都不用做 只要负责养孩子就好
There ain't a blessed thing you have to do except mind the kids.

890
01:19:42,797 --> 01:19:43,855
很抱歉…
I'm sorry.

891
01:19:45,936 --> 01:19:46,960
现在不行
Not now.

892
01:19:48,272 --> 01:19:49,296
以后也不行
Not ever.

893
01:19:57,354 --> 01:19:58,514
真是可惜…
What a waste.

894
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:03,828
像你这样条件的女人
Someone put together, like you.

895
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:11,675
艾姬
Aggie.

896
01:20:15,849 --> 01:20:20,288
那些发大财的人 用金钱享尽荣华富贵
Those who struck it rich wanted all the pleasures that money could buy...

897
01:20:20,724 --> 01:20:23,057
他们要买的东西数都数不尽
...and there were plenty to sell to them.

898
01:20:23,295 --> 01:20:26,663
即便在沙加缅度的游船上 也充斥着奢华气氛
Even the Sacramento riverboats took on luxury goods.

899
01:20:50,537 --> 01:20:51,663
我跟
I'll see it.

900
01:20:53,976 --> 01:20:55,375
该你了
It's up to you.

901
01:20:56,848 --> 01:20:57,837
下注？
Bettin'?

902
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:03,056
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

903
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:06,818
- 我打烊了 - 打烊？
-I'm checkin' out. -Checkin' out?

904
01:21:06,864 --> 01:21:08,924
他怎么回事？
What's the matter with him?

905
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,973
走吧，走吧
"Come, come

906
01:21:16,512 --> 01:21:18,879
有一片神奇的土地
"There's a wondrous land

907
01:21:19,717 --> 01:21:22,619
我将在哪里给你建一个家
"Where I'll build you a home

908
01:21:23,055 --> 01:21:26,389
在荒草上
"In the meadow

哦，它们闪耀得多么明亮
"Oh, how bright they'll shine

911
01:21:33,405 --> 01:21:35,897
在同一片领域成为领主
"On a world the Lord

西部为拓荒者成为有产者而设计
"Must have helped design

哦，它们闪耀得多么明亮
"Oh, how bright they'll shine

915
01:21:46,092 --> 01:21:49,062
我们的家将在那里建立
"On that home we will build

为了充满希望的心
"For the hopeful heart

心甘情愿用手付出勤劳

在荒草上
"In the meadow! "

925
01:22:39,109 --> 01:22:40,907
莉莉，我必须和你谈谈
Lily, I got to talk to you.

926
01:22:45,052 --> 01:22:47,613
我刚才手气正好 但我却打烊不玩了
I found myself throwing in a winning hand.

927
01:22:48,758 --> 01:22:51,023
我从未想过我会为任何女孩那样做
I just never thought I'd do that for any girl.

928
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,427
莉莉

929
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:57,603
你可愿意和一个 没出息的赌徒在一起？
How would you like to hook up with a no-good gambler?

930
01:23:02,713 --> 01:23:05,877
喔，亲爱的，咱们走吧 我这里有一千两百元
Oh, Hon, we are on our way. I got $1,200 right here.

931
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:08,512
- 我们要怎么花，开一间赌场？ - 不
-What'll we do, open a gambling house? -No.

932
01:23:09,057 --> 01:23:11,288
一个已婚的男人晚上应该待在家里
A married man should spend his evenings at home.

933
01:23:11,527 --> 01:23:14,019
那我们到旧金山开一家歌厅
Well, then we'll open a music hall in San Francisco.

934
01:23:14,064 --> 01:23:15,862
- 不 - 我还能唱歌跳舞
-I can still sing and dance. -No.

935
01:23:15,934 --> 01:23:18,802
不行，已婚的女人 晚上应该待在家里
A married woman should spend her evenings at home.

936
01:23:18,871 --> 01:23:21,807
- 可是我们不能光坐在家里花钱… - 莉莉…
But we can't sit at home on $1,200 forever.

937
01:23:22,744 --> 01:23:24,576
你去过旧金山吗？
Have you seen San Francisco?

938
01:23:25,349 --> 01:23:28,547
那里又丑又小 到处都是跳蚤
It's ugly, and it's small, and it's full of fleas.

939
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:31,190
每五分钟就被大火烧掉…
It burns down about every five minutes...

940
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:35,821
每次它再度重建都比之前更大更棒
...but each time they keep on rebuilding it a little bigger and better than before.

941
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:39,569
那里生气蓬勃 没有任何事情能阻挡它
It's alive and kicking and nothin' can stop it.

942
01:23:40,673 --> 01:23:43,234
让人想要在那里进行建设
And it makes you want to build somethin', too.

943
01:23:43,911 --> 01:23:45,003
一家铁路公司
A railroad.

944
01:23:45,981 --> 01:23:47,346
一家蒸汽船公司
A steamship line.

945
01:23:48,218 --> 01:23:50,585
能帮助宝宝成长的地方
Somethin' to help the baby grow.

946
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:53,151
克里夫，就用那一千两百元？
Cleve, on $1,200?

947
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:56,262
我们可以先从经营篷车或 划桨船公司开始
But we could start out with a wagon or a rowboat.

948
01:23:57,366 --> 01:24:00,632
只要动点脑筋 我敢打赌我们一定能成功的
With the help of the devil, I bet we'll make it.

949
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,471
（中场）

950
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:48,709
（进场）

951
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:47,165
年轻的美国不仅是东部与西部的结合
Young America was not only a union of East and West.

952
01:29:48,575 --> 01:29:50,542
另外还有北部和南部
There were North and South, too.

953
01:29:51,379 --> 01:29:54,074
然而南北之间的关系却愈来愈薄弱
And between them the bonds were weakening.

954
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:58,046
从国会议员退休的林肯先生 现在正从事律师的工作…
Mr. Lincoln, now retired from Congress and practicing law...

955
01:29:58,389 --> 01:30:00,686
他意识到南部将会抵抗…
...realized that the South would fight...

956
01:30:00,757 --> 01:30:04,522
并企图建立他们自己的疆土与形象
...to mold the new and uncommitted territories to its own image.

957
01:30:05,097 --> 01:30:07,621
离他上任总统仍有两年…
Still, two years from the presidency...

958
01:30:07,767 --> 01:30:11,031
他誓言要解放西部 并让它保持自由…
...he pleaded that the free West be allowed to remain free...

959
01:30:11,436 --> 01:30:14,734
并为国家即将瓦解分裂的现象 提出警告
...and warned of the hazards of a house divided against itself.

960
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:16,805
可是南部眼见他们的 影响势力慢慢减弱…
But the South...

961
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,535
...seeing it's power and influence wane...

962
01:30:19,615 --> 01:30:23,516
在许多西部城镇里进行 各种抗争活动
...struggled against the inevitable in dozens of Western towns.

963
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:28,579
内战的仇恨种子 因此逐渐生根发芽
And slowly, the bitter seeds of civil war took root.

964
01:31:06,573 --> 01:31:08,130
你好，罗林太太
Howdy, Mrs. Rawlings.

965
01:31:11,148 --> 01:31:12,876
哇！马儿！哇！
Whoa, Rosebud.

966
01:31:14,617 --> 01:31:15,981
皮特森先生
Hey, Mr. Peterson.

967
01:31:16,487 --> 01:31:18,147
你穿这身衣服是什么？
What's that suit you got on?

968
01:31:18,622 --> 01:31:20,646
制服啊，罗林太大
Uniform, Mrs. Rawlings.

969
01:31:20,926 --> 01:31:22,552
这是制服
A uniform.

970
01:31:22,896 --> 01:31:25,591
我们的国民军已宣誓加入…
Our militia company was sworn in.

971
01:31:25,866 --> 01:31:29,596
我现在是下士皮特森 俄亥俄州自愿军
I'm Corporal Peterson now, Ohio Volunteers.

972
01:31:30,205 --> 01:31:32,638
你将有一阵子不会看到我
You won't be seein' me for a spell.

973
01:31:33,542 --> 01:31:37,102
有一封信是给你的 从加州寄来的
Hey, I got a letter for you, from way out in California.

974
01:31:37,548 --> 01:31:39,640
一定是我妹妹莉莉丝
It must be from my sister, Lilith.

975
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:45,520
“亲爱的伊芙…”
"Dear Eve...."

976
01:31:50,866 --> 01:31:53,129
皮特森先生，你能不能等一下？
Mr. Peterson, could you wait a minute?

977
01:31:53,536 --> 01:31:55,332
我想马上回信给她
I wanna answer this right away.

978
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,387
齐伯？

979
01:31:57,573 --> 01:31:59,062
齐伯，过来一下
Zeb, come on down here.

980
01:31:59,642 --> 01:32:02,201
我们希望齐伯能和我们一起去
We was hopin' Zeb might be goin' with us.

981
01:32:03,947 --> 01:32:06,039
他爸在号角吹第一声时便出发了
Pa went when the first bugle blew.

982
01:32:06,952 --> 01:32:08,282
那还不够吗？
Ain't one enough?

983
01:32:09,755 --> 01:32:10,880
嗨，下士
Hi, Corporal.

984
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:15,687
杰若迈亚，去拿脱脂奶油给皮特森先生
Jeremiah, give Mr. Peterson some buttermilk.

985
01:32:16,263 --> 01:32:17,559
脱脂奶油
Buttermilk!

986
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,240
是你莉莉丝阿姨写来的
It's from your Aunt Lilith.

987
01:32:31,582 --> 01:32:35,608
她说在加州没有战争 他们说将来也不会有战争
Says there ain't no war out in California and they don't expect there'll be one.

988
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:38,154
“生意做得很好”
"Business is brisk.

989
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:41,722
“对活力充沛的年轻人而言 有许多工作机会”
"Many opportunities for an energetic young man."

990
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:45,129
他们正打算搭建一条铁路
There's talk of building a railroad east.

991
01:32:46,135 --> 01:32:49,035
“克里夫正在努力打通关系”
"Cleve has hopes of gettin' in on the ground floor.

992
01:32:49,907 --> 01:32:52,306
“如果齐伯想过来，我们很欢迎他”
"We would welcome Zeb if he wants to come."

993
01:32:52,776 --> 01:32:55,141
妈，你写信和她谈我的事？
Ma, did you write her about me?

994
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:58,377
- 没有啦
Not exactly--

995
01:32:58,618 --> 01:32:59,777
- 有没有？
Now, did you?

996
01:33:00,318 --> 01:33:03,775
我告诉她你不喜欢务农 就和爸一样
I told her you didn't like farmin' any better than your pa did.

997
01:33:04,224 --> 01:33:06,714
妈，你对这场战争的看法不正确
Ma, you got the wrong idea about this war.

998
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:09,989
并不是很糟的，是吧，下士？
It ain't gonna be so bad, is it, Corporal?

999
01:33:10,266 --> 01:33:12,324
你知道爸出征报效国家
You know, Pa's havin' the time of his life.

1000
01:33:12,435 --> 01:33:15,403
罗林太太 是上校亲口告诉我的…
Now, Mrs. Rawlings, I got it from the captain himself...

1001
01:33:15,642 --> 01:33:18,769
我们短时间不可能会撤退的
...that we ain't gonna be gone no time at all.

1002
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:24,774
我上不上战场，爸都由你决定  但你知道他内心是怎么想的
Pa left it up to you whether I go or not. But you know what he really felt.

1003
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,808


1004
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:28,876
罗林太太，成天在锄犁后面踩踏 根本没啥光荣可言
Mrs. Rawlings, there ain't much glory in trompin' behind a plow.

1005
01:33:30,026 --> 01:33:32,926
我想这封信就不急着回了
I reckon there's no hurry in answerin' this letter.

1006
01:33:34,029 --> 01:33:35,655
多谢你等候
Thank you for waitin'.

1007
01:33:38,203 --> 01:33:39,669
你是说我能去罗？
You mean I can go?

1008
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:43,862
喔，有好多事要做
Well, there'll be things to do.

1009
01:33:46,145 --> 01:33:47,133
妈…
Ma....

1010
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:53,081
我得帮你洗内裤 补袜子的破洞
I've gotta get your underwear washed and your socks darned.

1011
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:58,687
他们会给你那种衣服吗？
Do they give you one of them suits?

1012
01:33:59,697 --> 01:34:01,220
那种制服？
One of them uniforms?

1013
01:34:02,867 --> 01:34:03,855
会的
I reckon.

1014
01:34:06,203 --> 01:34:08,762
可能不会给你衬衣
They might not give you no shirts though.

1015
01:34:09,108 --> 01:34:11,507
把那件脱下来 我帮你洗
Take that one off. I'll wash it for you.

1016
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:15,246
我已经洗了其他几件 还没烫过呢
I got the others washed but they aren't ironed yet.

1017
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:17,975
母亲，我…
Mother, I....

1018
01:34:21,724 --> 01:34:23,213
你为什么那样叫我？
Why'd you call me that?

1019
01:34:23,859 --> 01:34:25,723
你总是喊我“妈”
It's always been Ma before.

1020
01:34:28,933 --> 01:34:30,058
不晓得…
I don't know.

1021
01:34:31,136 --> 01:34:32,432
突然间…
All of a sudden...

1022
01:34:33,806 --> 01:34:36,069
喊“妈”似乎已经不够了
...Ma didn't seem enough somehow.

1023
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,095
嘿！小子！
Yahoo. Hey, cowpoke!

1024
01:35:51,072 --> 01:35:52,333
回去！狗狗！
Go on back, dog.

1025
01:35:54,176 --> 01:35:55,142
回去！
Go on!

1026
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:20,239
我能怎么办，爸？
What could I do, Pa?

1027
01:36:21,411 --> 01:36:22,877
他是奈勒斯的儿子
He's Linus' boy.

1028
01:36:26,251 --> 01:36:28,241
从小到大就像奈勒斯
Always was more Linus' blood.

1029
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:34,555
所以我才会那么爱他吧
I guess that's why I love him so much.

1030
01:36:40,569 --> 01:36:42,900
但您得帮我祈祷，爸…
But you've got to help me pray, Pa.

1031
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:49,339
帮我祈祷
Help me pray.

1032
01:37:28,161 --> 01:37:29,127
俄亥俄！
Ohio.

1033
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:31,266
俄亥俄州炮兵连队！
Battery "B", Ohio.

1034
01:37:32,435 --> 01:37:34,368
- 走吧！ - 快点！
-Let's go! -On the double. Come on.

1035
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:37,768
有谁是密西根州的第十二连队？
Anybody here from the Twelfth Michigan?

1036
01:37:38,975 --> 01:37:41,135
印地安那州的三十六连队
Thirty-sixth Indiana.

1037
01:37:44,985 --> 01:37:48,078
1862年4月6日夜里…
Evening of April Sixth, 1862.

1038
01:37:49,121 --> 01:37:52,112
响彻云霄一整天的枪炮 现在恢复宁静…
The guns that had roared all day fell silent...

1039
01:37:52,394 --> 01:37:56,762
就在一间叫做沙罗会议厅 的小教堂旁边的
...around a little church called the Shiloh Meeting House.

1040
01:37:58,201 --> 01:38:00,998
许多人在那星期日都见到了上帝…
Many a man had met his God that Sunday...

1041
01:38:02,274 --> 01:38:03,672
只是不是在教堂里
...but not in church.

1042
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,287
你等于在浪费时间 他已经死了
You wasted your time, men. He's dead.

1043
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:16,345
- 不，医生，他是罗林上校
But, Doc, this here is Captain Rawlings!

1044
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:18,515
- 奈勒斯罗林上校
Captain Linus Rawlings.

1045
01:38:18,761 --> 01:38:20,728
- 把他带出去 - 走吧
-Take him out. -Keep movin', men.

1046
01:38:30,274 --> 01:38:32,332
- 你走路干嘛不长眼睛？
Why can't you look where you're goin'?

1047
01:38:32,413 --> 01:38:33,777
- 对不起，士兵
I'm sorry, soldier.

1048
01:38:34,148 --> 01:38:35,307
小心点！
Watch it.

1049
01:38:42,591 --> 01:38:44,319
铁锯…白兰地…
Saw. Brandy.

1050
01:38:45,094 --> 01:38:46,185
麻醉剂
Chloroform.

1051
01:38:47,464 --> 01:38:48,657
全部都拿来
Get it all down.

1052
01:38:48,732 --> 01:38:50,255
全拿来！
Come on, all of it!

1053
01:38:52,435 --> 01:38:54,595
走吧，我们在这里只会碍事
Come on. We're just in the way here.

1054
01:38:59,446 --> 01:39:03,472
那是西区战事前线最血腥的一天
It had been the bloodiest day of the war on the Western front.

1055
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:08,077
白天看起来好像邦联大获全胜
In the morning, it had looked like a Confederate victory...

1056
01:39:08,491 --> 01:39:10,117
但是一到晚上…
...but by nightfall...

1057
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:13,895
再也没有人提到 “赢”或“输”这几个字眼
...no man cared to use the words "win" or "lose".

1058
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:18,357
在沙罗会议厅之后…
After Shiloh...

1059
01:39:20,138 --> 01:39:21,729
南方军从未展开笑颜
...the South never smiled.

1060
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,555
- 你有没有尝过这个水？ - 没有
You tasted that water yet?

1061
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:39,926
尝尝看
-No. -Well, try it.

1062
01:39:45,837 --> 01:39:47,599
- 味道怪怪的，是吧？ - 是啊
-Tastes funny, huh? -Yeah.

1063
01:39:48,275 --> 01:39:50,538
太阳下山之前 水是粉红色的
I seen it before sundown. It was pink.

1064
01:39:51,146 --> 01:39:52,635
比黄樟茶还要红
Pinker than sassafras tea.

1065
01:39:53,782 --> 01:39:54,748
你是说…？
You mean...?

1066
01:39:54,849 --> 01:39:57,840
头脑正常的人不应该会喝这种水
It don't seem fittin' a man should have to drink water like that.

1067
01:39:57,921 --> 01:40:01,617
头脑正常的人不应该会做出 咱们今天做过的事
Don't seem fittin' a man should have to do any of the things we've done today.

1068
01:40:01,692 --> 01:40:03,420
你有没有杀人？
Did you kill anybody?

1069
01:40:04,863 --> 01:40:06,329
应该没有
I don't think so.

1070
01:40:07,434 --> 01:40:09,367
我一开始就被人打昏
I got knocked dizzy right off.

1071
01:40:10,871 --> 01:40:14,306
当我醒来之后找到我的枪 已经被弄坏了
Then when I come to and found my rifle, it was busted.

1072
01:40:16,476 --> 01:40:20,172
然后来了几个士兵拿东西刺我的手
Then some more soldiers come along and tried to stick me in the arm.

1073
01:40:22,885 --> 01:40:25,375
剩下来的部分都全混在一起了
All the rest is, is mixed up after that.

1074
01:40:25,923 --> 01:40:28,891
我也没杀任何人 我不想杀人
I ain't killed nobody, neither. And I don't want to.

1075
01:40:31,229 --> 01:40:33,321
- 你打哪来的？ - 俄亥俄州
-Hey, where you from? -Ohio.

1076
01:40:34,735 --> 01:40:38,534
这场蠢战争从东部开打 咱们西部的人干嘛淌这混水？
This fool war started in the East. What's us Westerners doin' in it?

1077
01:40:38,838 --> 01:40:40,737
我再也搞不清楚了！
I don't rightly know any more!

1078
01:40:46,216 --> 01:40:48,012
和我原来想的不太一样
It ain't quite what I expected.

1079
01:40:50,489 --> 01:40:54,254
一个开膛破肚的人 哪有任何光荣可言
There ain't much glory in lookin' at a man with his guts hangin' out.

1080
01:40:57,996 --> 01:40:59,963
- 你打哪来的？ - 德州
-Where you from? -Texas.

1081
01:41:02,437 --> 01:41:03,425
我说啊…
Say....

1082
01:41:04,406 --> 01:41:05,963
你该不会是南方军的人吧？
You ain't a Reb, are you?

1083
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:09,907
今天早上我是的 今晚我就不确定了
Well, I was this mornin'. Tonight, I ain't so sure.

1084
01:41:11,648 --> 01:41:14,514
我好像应该得对你开枪
It seems like, I oughta be shootin' you.

1085
01:41:16,388 --> 01:41:18,651
你有东西可以射杀我吗？
Well, you got anything to shoot with?

1086
01:41:21,395 --> 01:41:22,383
没有
No.

1087
01:41:23,297 --> 01:41:24,923
我只有这把刺刀
All I got's this bayonet.

1088
01:41:26,033 --> 01:41:27,431
我有一把手枪
I got a pistol.

1089
01:41:29,271 --> 01:41:31,067
我从一个阵亡军官身上拿到的
I took it off a dead officer.

1090
01:41:34,978 --> 01:41:37,411
咱们何不溜出这里？
Hey, why don't we skedaddle out of here?

1091
01:41:38,682 --> 01:41:40,842
- 你是说弃职潜逃？ - 为什么不呢？
-You mean desert? -I mean, why don't--

1092
01:41:40,918 --> 01:41:43,784
让那些想打仗的人去打吧
Just leave this here war to the folks who want it.

1093
01:41:49,664 --> 01:41:52,962
人家都说在加州没有战争
They say there ain't no war out in California.

1094
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:57,445
把小队召集到这里

1095
01:41:59,876 --> 01:42:02,309
脱队者！快加入自己的小队！
Stragglers, join your regiment.

1096
01:42:02,378 --> 01:42:03,810
脱队者！嘿！你！
Stragglers! Hey, you!

1097
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:16,825
我打算把卢梭小队移到这一区
I'm planning to move Rousseau's brigade into this area.

1098
01:42:17,565 --> 01:42:22,399
潜伏此地，在日出前部署完毕 你批准吗？
Hidden battery, placed well before dawn. Do you approve?

1099
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:24,995
你所做的任何部署安排 我都批准
I'll approve any dispositions you want to make.

1100
01:42:25,611 --> 01:42:29,102
今天要不是你I卫侧翼 我们很可能全军覆没
If you hadn't held the flank today, we'd have been whipped for fair.

1101
01:42:30,415 --> 01:42:34,009
薛曼一自们坐一下 我有话要告诉你
Sherman, let's sit down a minute. There's somethin' I wanna say to you.

1102
01:42:36,423 --> 01:42:37,389
油灯
Lantern.

1103
01:42:43,899 --> 01:42:46,128
接下来可能由你独挑大梁了
You may find yourself in command here.

1104
01:42:46,371 --> 01:42:47,359
为什么？
Why?

1105
01:42:48,072 --> 01:42:51,871
我看过今天发刊的新闻报纸文章
I've seen some of the dispatches the newspaper correspondents...

1106
01:42:51,942 --> 01:42:53,499
...have filed today.

1107
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:57,138
他们说今天早上的突袭 出乎我意料之外
They're sayin' I was taken by surprise this morning.

1108
01:42:57,484 --> 01:42:59,417
那并未出乎你意料之外
You weren't taken by surprise.

1109
01:43:00,154 --> 01:43:01,177
我有
I was.

1110
01:43:01,622 --> 01:43:02,679
不管怎样…
No matter.

1111
01:43:03,724 --> 01:43:04,985
他们说…
They're sayin'...

1112
01:43:06,626 --> 01:43:08,616
我昨晚又喝醉酒了
...I was drunk again last night.

1113
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:13,035
你有吗？
Were you?

1114
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:17,094
没有
No.

1115
01:43:18,511 --> 01:43:20,671
但是蜡烛两头烧根本行不通
But you can't fight front and rear.

1116
01:43:21,515 --> 01:43:23,004
明天无论打输或打赢…
Win or lose, tomorrow...

1117
01:43:24,785 --> 01:43:26,479
我都要辞职
...I intend to resign.

1118
01:43:28,055 --> 01:43:29,783
就因为报纸的那些文章？
Because of the newspapers?

1119
01:43:32,761 --> 01:43:35,786
因为大众对我缺乏信心
Because of the general lack of confidence in me.

1120
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:39,066
喔，你以为我从未有过那种感受？
Don't you think I've ever felt like that?

1121
01:43:39,204 --> 01:43:42,070
一个月前他们骂我是 疯子，脑筋不正常
A month ago they were sayin' I was crazy. Insane.

1122
01:43:42,976 --> 01:43:46,672
现在他们夸我是大英雄 不管是疯子或英雄，我还是我
And now they're callin' me a hero. Hero or crazy, I'm the same man.

1123
01:43:47,813 --> 01:43:50,212
无论别人怎么想
It doesn't matter what the people think.

1124
01:43:50,453 --> 01:43:52,215
都是你自己想的，格兰特
It's what you think, Grant.

1125
01:43:54,589 --> 01:43:56,453
那就是格兰特？
You mean that's Grant?

1126
01:43:58,861 --> 01:44:00,054
是的
I reckon.

1127
01:44:00,265 --> 01:44:01,697
格兰特将军
General Grant.

1128
01:44:02,799 --> 01:44:06,234
这场战争将在西部取得胜利 如何取得胜利…
You know this war is gonna be won in the West and how to win it.

1129
01:44:06,472 --> 01:44:08,496
要由你的所作所为去证实
Everything you've done proves it.

1130
01:44:09,642 --> 01:44:13,702
一个人只有在做错事时 才有资格辞职
And I say that a man has the right to resign only if he's wrong.

1131
01:44:15,116 --> 01:44:16,605
做对事时便没有资格
Not if he's right.

1132
01:44:18,854 --> 01:44:22,050
我想我从来没那样想过
I guess I never thought of it that way.

1133
01:44:24,495 --> 01:44:25,859
我会好好考虑的
I'll think it over.

1134
01:44:26,264 --> 01:44:27,992
还有什么好考虑的？
What is there to think about?

1135
01:44:28,032 --> 01:44:31,694
军队有你在是比较好的 那便是一种考验
The Army's better off with you than without you. That's the test.

1136
01:44:36,043 --> 01:44:37,100
好吧
All right.

1137
01:44:38,045 --> 01:44:39,033
谢谢
Thanks.

1138
01:44:41,215 --> 01:44:43,808
日出之前有很多事要做，薛曼
There's a lot to do before morning, Sherman?

1139
01:44:44,253 --> 01:44:45,810
你在做什么？
What are you doin'?

1140
01:45:03,913 --> 01:45:05,641
你为什么逼我那么做？
Why'd you make me do that?

1141
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:56,016
开火！

1142
01:46:05,756 --> 01:46:09,885
"When Johnny comes marching home again Hurrah, hurrah

1143
01:46:10,129 --> 01:46:14,292
"We'll give him a hearty welcome and Hurrah, hurrah

1144
01:46:14,635 --> 01:46:18,900
"The men will cheer, the boys will shout The ladies they will all turn out

1145
01:46:19,009 --> 01:46:23,206
"And we'll all feel gay When Johnny comes marching home

1146
01:46:23,345 --> 01:46:27,337
"Get ready to join the jubilee Hurrah, hurrah

1147
01:46:27,854 --> 01:46:31,983
"We'll drink up a toast, or two, or three Hurrah, hurrah

1148
01:46:32,192 --> 01:46:36,651
"The band will play and we'll sing for joy And all the ladies will kiss the boys

1149
01:46:36,729 --> 01:46:40,755
"And we'll all feel gay When Johnny comes marching home

1150
01:46:41,003 --> 01:46:43,334
"The men will cheer, the boys will shout"

1151
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:10,466
（奈勒斯罗林 1810年至1862年）

1152
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:13,469
（伊芙普莱斯考特罗林）

1153
01:47:36,207 --> 01:47:37,264
嘿，齐伯！
Hey, Zeb.

1154
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:05,072
你没收到我的信？
Didn't you get my letter?

1155
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:08,803
我四个多月前寄出的
I wrote more than four months ago.

1156
01:48:12,152 --> 01:48:13,413
在得知爸爸的消息之后…
She never was...

1157
01:48:14,323 --> 01:48:17,257
她整个人便再也不复从前
...quite the same after she got the news about Pa.

1158
01:48:21,197 --> 01:48:23,824
我觉得她并不害怕死亡，齐伯 只是…
I don't think she minded goin', Zeb, except...

1159
01:48:26,071 --> 01:48:28,061
她当时很想再见你一面
...she wanted to see you again.

1160
01:48:33,179 --> 01:48:35,169
当然，爸爸的尸骨并不在那里
'Course Pa ain't really there.

1161
01:48:38,487 --> 01:48:40,249
我还是立了一个碑
I put up a stone anyway.

1162
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:01,618
好吧…

1163
01:49:02,317 --> 01:49:04,011
我得上路了
I'd better be on my way.

1164
01:49:05,052 --> 01:49:06,643
上路？去哪？
Way? Where?

1165
01:49:07,557 --> 01:49:09,046
我需要你，齐伯
I need you, Zeb.

1166
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:11,650
我回来只为了一件事…
Only one thing brought me back...

1167
01:49:13,295 --> 01:49:14,659
她…
...and she's....

1168
01:49:15,433 --> 01:49:17,366
这个农场有一半是你的
Well, this farm is half yours.

1169
01:49:17,971 --> 01:49:22,270
我在想我们好不容易清出 河边的那条道路…
I'm thinkin' we'd finally clear away that patch of woods down by the river....

1170
01:49:22,642 --> 01:49:25,405
你比我还懂得处理农场的事 你并不需要我
You're twice the farmer I am. You don't need me.

1171
01:49:26,579 --> 01:49:29,103
农场是你的了 这样才公平
That farm's all yours. That's only fair.

1172
01:49:31,421 --> 01:49:33,615
这样我还是觉得不太好
I sure don't feel right about this.

1173
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:36,016
那你打算去哪里？
What are you gonna do?

1174
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,956
我还不晓得
I haven't mustered out yet.

1175
01:49:38,027 --> 01:49:40,221
我还可以转任当普通警官
I can still transfer to the regulars.

1176
01:49:40,365 --> 01:49:42,628
或许到西部当骑警
The cavalry, maybe. And go West.

1177
01:49:43,503 --> 01:49:45,231
去和印地安人对抗？
And have to fight Indians?

1178
01:49:46,706 --> 01:49:49,003
我真的很不了解你，齐伯
You sure are hard to make out, Zeb.

1179
01:49:49,411 --> 01:49:52,538
你干嘛要那么做？ 你喜欢打架吗？
Now, what do you wanna do that for? Do you like fightin'?

1180
01:49:54,615 --> 01:49:59,017
你还记得爸曾经告诉我们 他对抗大熊的故事吗？
Do you remember the story Pa used to tell us about fightin' that grizzly bear?

1181
01:49:59,122 --> 01:50:00,088
记得
Yeah.

1182
01:50:00,292 --> 01:50:03,522
我问他：“你为什么要做出那种事？”
And I asked him. I said: "Now, why'd you get in such a fix?

1183
01:50:03,595 --> 01:50:05,619
“你喜欢和大熊打架吗？”
"Do you like fightin' grizzlies?"

1184
01:50:06,264 --> 01:50:07,287
他说…
He said:

1185
01:50:08,066 --> 01:50:11,159
“那倒也不是…”
"Well, not 'specially.

1186
01:50:12,507 --> 01:50:16,067
“我只是想到外面闯 结果那只熊比我先到那里”
"I just wanted to go somewhere and the bear was there first."

1187
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:31,208
所以我…

1188
01:50:34,235 --> 01:50:36,759
我想我也要出去闯了
I guess I just wanna go somewhere, too.

1189
01:50:41,309 --> 01:50:43,572
- 再会 - 再会，齐伯
-So long. -So long, Zeb.

1190
01:51:04,006 --> 01:51:06,803
正当北部和南部成分裂局势时…
Even while North and South were being torn apart...

1191
01:51:07,411 --> 01:51:11,073
东部和西部却慢慢统合 透过《驿马快递》…
...East and West had been drawn together by the Pony Express...

1192
01:51:11,414 --> 01:51:13,813
有史以来最危险的通邮服务
...the most daring mail route in history.

1193
01:51:14,053 --> 01:51:17,681
八十名骑士着邮包 风雨无阻，日以继夜地奔驰…
Eighty riders were in the saddle at all times, night and day, in all weather.

1194
01:51:17,722 --> 01:51:20,417
一半往东骑 一半往西骑…
Half of them riding east, half riding west...

1195
01:51:20,694 --> 01:51:23,059
来回于密苏里和沙加缅度之间
...between Missouri and Sacramento...

1196
01:51:23,197 --> 01:51:26,495
让邮件于几天内寄达 不用再花几个月时间
...carrying mail cross-country in days instead of months.

1197
01:51:27,335 --> 01:51:29,393
他们不配武器，只为轻便成行
Unarmed, they rode to save weight.

1198
01:51:30,272 --> 01:51:33,638
一封信邮费五元 只能寄薄薄的信纸
Five dollars a letter, the mail cost, and on thin paper, too.

1199
01:51:34,175 --> 01:51:37,041
这项服务代表着勇气 技术以及速度…
It was courage, skill and speed...

1200
01:51:37,349 --> 01:51:41,580
对抗充满敌意的印地安人，土匪 有时还得应付洪水
...against hostile Indians, bandits, hell and occasional high water.

1201
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:46,586
在他们奔驰的同时 人们另外开始搭建…
Even as they rode, men were already building a faster...

1202
01:51:46,727 --> 01:51:50,321
更快速的横贯全国的 《大陆电报线路》
...message carrier across the country, the Overland Telegraph.

1203
01:51:50,799 --> 01:51:53,358
结果让印地安人找到新的娱乐
And the Indians found a new amusement...

1204
01:51:53,535 --> 01:51:56,469
聆听电线传送出的歌唱声音
...listening to the level tune of the singing wires.

1205
01:51:56,807 --> 01:51:59,070
可是印地安人却对另一件事 感到不快…
But far less amusing to the Indians...

1206
01:51:59,142 --> 01:52:02,372
即有铁马之称的火车铁路的到来
...was the coming of the steel roadway of the Iron Horse.

1207
01:52:03,315 --> 01:52:08,308
铁道路线预定经过 伟大的天然屏障：洛矶山脉…
The surveyors' route lay through immense natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...

1208
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:11,889
以及同样令人生畏的喜耶亚山区
...and the equally discouraging High Sierras.

1209
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:16,593
然而浩瀚的崇山峻岭并无法阻挡 两家大企业…
But range upon range could never stop the titanic contest...

1210
01:52:16,696 --> 01:52:19,425
争先建造有史以来…
...between two corporate giants racing to put down...

1211
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:22,336
最长的铁道 最后将交会会合
...the greatest mileage of track before they met:

1212
01:52:23,139 --> 01:52:26,767
《中太平洋公司》负责从沙加缅度 往东至喜耶亚山区
The Central Pacific eastward from Sacramento through the Sierras.

1213
01:52:31,652 --> 01:52:35,519
《联合太平洋公司》则横跨整个 西向平原区…
And the Union Pacific, forging westward across the plains...

1214
01:52:35,822 --> 01:52:37,812
但仍需克服洛矶山脉的屏障
...with the Rockies still to come.

1215
01:52:37,927 --> 01:52:42,795
这场竞赛的奖赏是免费土地 铁道所到之处便可获得当地广大土地
The prize in the race was free land, vast parcels for every mile of track laid.

1216
01:52:43,666 --> 01:52:46,259
将来有天，那些土地将价值百万
Land that would one day be worth millions.

1217
01:52:52,245 --> 01:52:53,268
停止
Hold it!

1218
01:52:54,313 --> 01:52:55,472
放下！
Set it down!

1219
01:52:56,615 --> 01:52:57,808
工人们，站起来！
Up!

1220
01:53:04,726 --> 01:53:06,283
你在哪找到的？
Where'd you find 'em?

1221
01:53:06,529 --> 01:53:08,359
差不多一哩之外
'Bout a mile back yonder.

1222
01:53:09,498 --> 01:53:11,863
- 是强尼霍马兹 - 那是杰克帕金
That's Johnny Hormatz. And Jack Perkins.

1223
01:53:15,174 --> 01:53:17,164
在搞什么？野餐吗？
What the hell is this? A picnic?

1224
01:53:17,343 --> 01:53:18,809
- 印地安人杀了我们的几个人
The Indians got a couple of our men--

1225
01:53:18,876 --> 01:53:22,276
- 先生，你之前是工头…
Mister, you were the foreman here. Now you're a tracklayer.

1226
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:24,249
现在你沦为小工 大家全给我回去工作！
Now get back to work, all of you!

1227
01:53:24,318 --> 01:53:25,375
快点！
Move it!

1228
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:26,777
快！
Fast!

1229
01:53:27,556 --> 01:53:28,749
- 你 - 是的
-You. -Yes, sir?

1230
01:53:28,824 --> 01:53:32,623
你现在成了工头 直到我找到更棒的人取代你
You're the new foreman, till I find somebody better. Now get 'em at it!

1231
01:53:32,696 --> 01:53:34,458
- 遵命 - 快叫他们做事！
-Wait a minute. -Move it!

1232
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:34,725
- 等一下 - 快点！

1233
01:53:34,965 --> 01:53:36,955
你叫杰梭罗史都瓦特？
Is your name Jethro Stuart?

1234
01:53:39,370 --> 01:53:43,203
好，快点工作！
Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired to hunt buffalo to feed these men...

1235
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:43,025
杰梭罗史都瓦特先生 你的工作是去猎水牛喂这些工人…

1236
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:46,267
不是阻挠他们做事 你干嘛把尸体带回来？
...not to stop their work. Why'd you bring these bodies here?

1237
01:53:46,913 --> 01:53:50,211
我想铁路公司的人或许会有兴趣
They're railroaders. I thought somebody on the railroad might be interested.

1238
01:53:50,251 --> 01:53:52,741
我就是铁路公司的人 我一点兴趣都没有
I'm the railroad, and I'm not interested.

1239
01:53:53,422 --> 01:53:56,720
你应该就地埋掉 然后找出杀他们的印地安人
You should've buried 'em, then tracked down the Indians who did it.

1240
01:53:57,695 --> 01:54:02,427
金先生，就像你说的 我的工作是猎水牛
Mr. King, like you said, I was hired to hunt, not to dig graves or fight Indians.

1241
01:54:00,125 --> 01:54:03,253
不是挖坟墓 或去对付印地安人

1242
01:54:03,536 --> 01:54:07,631
这些人多半是退伍军人 几具尸体应该不会 让他们感到不适吧
Those fellas are mostly old soldiers. Two dead men shouldn't bother 'em much.

1243
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:07,799


1244
01:54:07,906 --> 01:54:11,932
除了工作，我不要他们有其他想法 你了解吗？
I don't want anything in their thick skulls but their work. Do you understand?

1245
01:54:12,012 --> 01:54:15,276
把那些尸体弄掉 开始去追查涉嫌的印地安人
Now get rid of those bodies and start trackin' those Indians.

1246
01:54:15,384 --> 01:54:18,910
你真是贵人多忘事，金先生 我的工作是猎水牛
You keep forgettin', Mr. King, my job's buffalo.

1247
01:54:21,924 --> 01:54:23,356
已经不是了
It was buffalo.

1248
01:54:23,963 --> 01:54:26,453
去找会计，把你的工时算一算
Go to the paymaster and draw your time.

1249
01:54:26,598 --> 01:54:29,031
刚才那个工头你并没开除他
That foreman fella, you didn't fire him.

1250
01:54:29,268 --> 01:54:31,929
你只是降他的职 因为你需要他
You just took him down a peg 'cause you needed him.

1251
01:54:32,005 --> 01:54:34,404
现在谁来负责猎水牛？你吗？
Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?

1252
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,708
- 那是什么鬼？ - 牛奶
-What the devil is that? -Milk.

1253
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:10,611
牛奶？
Milk?

1254
01:55:11,655 --> 01:55:14,088
看来我退伍之后 军队改变了不少
The Army must've changed since I was in it.

1255
01:55:14,358 --> 01:55:16,951
- 我刚到，我饿了 - 是吗？
-I just rode in. I'm hungry. -You are, huh?

1256
01:55:18,865 --> 01:55:21,332
但你宁可看他们吃东西
But you'd rather watch them than eat.

1257
01:55:21,568 --> 01:55:23,091
- 是这样吗？ - 是的
-Is that it? -That's it.

1258
01:55:23,437 --> 01:55:26,337
希望你是全力以赴在保护这条铁路
I wish you were as eager to protect this railroad.

1259
01:55:27,007 --> 01:55:30,339
你有没有听说 今天有两个人被杀？
Did you get any word about the two men who where killed today?

1260
01:55:30,412 --> 01:55:33,005
我找到阿拉巴赫族的人 并和他们酋长谈过
I tracked the Arapahoes and talked to the chief.

1261
01:55:33,716 --> 01:55:36,479
那两个人擅入禁区一哩内
They were a mile off the right-of-way where they had no business...

1262
01:55:36,554 --> 01:55:38,350
他们无权酒醉跑进那里 调戏印地安女人
...drunk and chasin' squaws.

1263
01:55:38,957 --> 01:55:41,857
- 他们和印地安人一样有错 - 是这样吗？
It was as much their fault as it was the Indians'.

1264
01:55:42,829 --> 01:55:46,889
阿兵哥，你的任务是对抗印地安人 不是和他们和谈
Well, soldier boy, your job is to fight Indians, not to agree with 'em.

1265
01:55:47,399 --> 01:55:51,027
金先生，当时有两百个阿拉巴赫人 我只有二十名手下
Mr. King, there were 200 Arapahoes and I had 20 men.

1266
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:53,439
对我而言…
Now, to me...

1267
01:55:53,776 --> 01:55:55,868
和谈是比对抗更为明智的选择
...agreein' seemed wiser than fightin'.

1268
01:55:55,978 --> 01:55:57,035
对你而言？
To you, huh?

1269
01:55:58,381 --> 01:56:01,645
或许我应该给上校派一份电报过去
You know, I might just send off a wire to the colonel.

1270
01:56:02,086 --> 01:56:03,552
他或许不会同意你的做法
He may not agree.

1271
01:56:05,457 --> 01:56:07,822
我已经呈报过 他也同意了
I already reported it. He does agree.

1272
01:56:41,438 --> 01:56:43,701
讯息已接收并知晓… 士兵
Acknowledged and understood. Sergeant.

1273
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:45,599
有麻烦吗，长官？
Trouble, sir?

1274
01:56:50,915 --> 01:56:52,074
我不知道
I don't know.

1275
01:56:52,652 --> 01:56:53,913
嘿，队长
Hey, Lieutenant.

1276
01:56:56,656 --> 01:56:58,623
我刚收到讯息 印地安人打算发动攻击
I just got a message the Indians are up to something.

1277
01:56:58,693 --> 01:57:00,626
你可知情？
Do you know anything about it?

1278
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:03,527
酋长说铁路公司毁约
The chief says the railroad's busted the agreement.

1279
01:57:03,633 --> 01:57:06,999
要改变路径 得从亚拉帕霍人的狩猎区经过
They've changed the route and are comin' through the Arapahoe huntin' grounds.

1280
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:09,629
- 你确定酋长没说错？ - 确定
-You sure the chief's right? -Plenty sure.

1281
01:57:09,739 --> 01:57:11,865
他们已经准备开战了
They're getting the warpaint ready.

1282
01:57:15,649 --> 01:57:17,741
你的意思是说…
Can you stand there and tell me...

1283
01:57:17,816 --> 01:57:21,751
一点小改变就会让 阿拉巴赫族少一头水牛…
...that one little change is gonna cost the Arapahoes one buffalo.

1284
01:57:21,888 --> 01:57:23,684
- 或者甚至少一头野兔？ - 金先生…
-Or even one jackrabbit? -Mr. King!

1285
01:57:24,125 --> 01:57:27,491
他们或许会觉得有所出入 但没有人要伤害他们啊！
They can be made to see it differently. Who's hurting 'em?

1286
01:57:27,730 --> 01:57:30,755
铁路到底是啥玩意？ 只不过是两条铁道和一个大哨子
What's a railroad anyway? Two tracks and a whistle.

1287
01:57:31,701 --> 01:57:35,067
他们怕的不是铁道 而是铁道即将带来的东西
It's not the tracks they're afraid of. It's what the tracks bring.

1288
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:38,006
水牛猎人猎杀他们的畜兽
The buffalo hunters slaughtering off their herds.

1289
01:57:38,143 --> 01:57:40,007
接下来拓荒者抵达之后…
And then the settlers coming in.

1290
01:57:40,078 --> 01:57:42,978
那到等到何时？ 二十，三十年之后？
And when will that be? Twenty, 30 years, maybe?

1291
01:57:43,049 --> 01:57:44,845
那个时候我们全都死了
By then, we'll all be dead.

1292
01:57:45,553 --> 01:57:47,679
现在我们只要横跨这片土地
Right now we're just crossing the land.

1293
01:57:47,755 --> 01:57:51,246
就这样，在我们有生之年 阿拉巴赫族的土地不会有事
That's all. Land that's safe to the Arapahoes for our lifetime.

1294
01:57:51,759 --> 01:57:54,784
你去和他们谈
Now, you go talk to 'em. Smoke a peacepipe with 'em.

1295
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:56,111
和他们抽抽和平烟 随他们怎样都好

1296
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:58,330
主要是和他们拟定新合约
Just get 'em to make a new agreement.

1297
01:58:00,104 --> 01:58:03,072
那是你的任务不是吗？ 维持和平？
That's your job, isn't it? Keeping the peace?

1298
01:58:05,042 --> 01:58:07,009
我会维持和平的，金先生
I'll keep the peace, Mr. King...

1299
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,110
但你也必须信守承诺
...if you keep your promise.

1300
01:58:18,195 --> 01:58:20,594
听说你姓罗林 你是俄亥俄州人
Hear your name's Rawlings and you're from Ohio.

1301
01:58:20,664 --> 01:58:23,655
你爸该不会是叫奈勒斯罗林吧？
Your pa's name couldn't be Linus Rawlings, could it?

1302
01:58:23,901 --> 01:58:25,333
- 是的 - 我认识他
-Could be. -Knew him.

1303
01:58:25,937 --> 01:58:27,096
我是杰梭罗史都瓦特
Jethro Stuart.

1304
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:29,569
- 他曾经提过你 - “曾经”？
-He used to speak of you. -Used to?

1305
01:58:30,109 --> 01:58:31,837
爸在沙罗殉身
Pa was killed at Shiloh.

1306
01:58:33,146 --> 01:58:34,703
请坐，史都瓦特先生
Sit down, Mr. Stuart.

1307
01:58:36,282 --> 01:58:38,579
至少强过死在锄犁后面
Well, better than dyin' behind a plow.

1308
01:58:38,821 --> 01:58:41,880
我曾经试图安定过一年
I tried it. Settled down for a year once.

1309
01:58:42,291 --> 01:58:44,383
害我少了十年寿命
It took ten years off my life.

1310
01:58:46,963 --> 01:58:48,020
你妈妈…
Your ma....

1311
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:53,035
她一定很特别 才能让奈勒斯甘心定下来
She must've been somethin' real special gettin' old Linus to stay put.

1312
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:56,901
她是的，史都瓦特先生 她很特别
She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.

1313
01:58:57,977 --> 01:58:59,000
这个老奈勒斯…
Old Linus.

1314
01:58:59,948 --> 01:59:04,213
有两午时间 你爸和我曾经一起捕兽皮…
Two years runnin' once, your pa and me trapped together. Up along the Wannakee.

1315
01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:04,512
就在望纳比那边

1316
01:59:04,385 --> 01:59:05,874
抓到好多海狸 多到必须将他们尾巴绑起来…
We got ourselves so many beaver...

1317
01:59:05,955 --> 01:59:09,014
才能把它们拖下山
...we had to tie 'em tail-to-tail just to drag 'em down the mountain.

1318
01:59:09,094 --> 01:59:12,028
有一哩长呢 那些海狸皮毛
Over a mile long it was, that line of beaver pelts.

1319
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:16,422
史都瓦特先生，我父亲可以把事实 加油添醋讲成六种版本
Mr. Stuart, my father could take the truth and stretch it about six ways.

1320
01:59:17,002 --> 01:59:18,764
你的口气和他好像
You sound just like him.

1321
01:59:20,074 --> 01:59:22,268
我想你这番话应该是赞美的意思
I'll take it you meant that kindly.

1322
01:59:22,844 --> 01:59:25,641
我可不敢随便说你是个骗子
Well, I'd think twice before I called you a liar.

1323
01:59:26,047 --> 01:59:28,344
提到骗子 我要问你一下…
Tell me somethin', talkin' about liars:

1324
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:32,783
为什么奈勒斯的儿子会和 麦克金这种人在一起？
Why would a son of old Linus get mixed up with a man like Mike King?

1325
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:36,058
我知道你的意思
I know what you mean.

1326
01:59:36,194 --> 01:59:38,286
但麦克金并不代表铁路
But Mike King isn't the railroad.

1327
01:59:39,330 --> 01:59:41,160
我不认为他知道这一点
I don't think he knows that.

1328
01:59:41,702 --> 01:59:43,862
他要把路线改回去，是吧？
He's changin' the route back, is he?

1329
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:45,258
没有
No.

1330
01:59:46,806 --> 01:59:47,794
我知道…
I know.

1331
01:59:47,909 --> 01:59:50,968
但他会不择手段 只为了比《中太平洋公司》抢先一天
But he'd do anything to gain a day on the Central Pacific.

1332
01:59:51,079 --> 01:59:53,342
他不是笨蛋，
But he's not a fool. He doesn't want a war.

1333
01:59:53,416 --> 01:59:55,349
他不想开战 阿拉巴赫族也不想
And neither do the Arapahoes.

1334
01:59:56,386 --> 01:59:58,979
我想我应该可以说服他们同意 改变铁道路线…
I think I could get them to agree to this change in route if...

1335
01:59:59,056 --> 02:00:01,683
如果我可以和他们坐下来好好聊一聊
...I could just sit down and talk with them for a while.

1336
02:00:01,757 --> 02:00:04,156
- 你要怎么做？ - 这便是问题所在
-How're you gonna get 'em to do it? -That's just it.

1337
02:00:04,498 --> 02:00:07,989
我需要一个懂他们语言 而且他们能信赖的人
I need somebody that knows the language and that they trust.

1338
02:00:09,102 --> 02:00:12,366
你有没有认识像这样的人 史都瓦特先生？
You wouldn't happen to know someone like that, would you, Mr. Stuart?

1339
02:00:16,212 --> 02:00:19,510
你老爸设陷阱的手段无人能比…
Your pa could set a trap like no man I ever come across.

1340
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:22,945
慢慢引他们上钩，然后…
Just coax 'em on, and wham!

1341
02:00:40,275 --> 02:00:44,040
你最好做点表态动作 好让他确定你不会食言
You'd better do somethin', so he'll know you're pledgin' your word.

1342
02:01:30,173 --> 02:01:34,040
那该死的哨声听起来好像 命运索魂令
That blame whistle's like the crack of doom from all that's natural.

1343
02:01:34,445 --> 02:01:37,538
我妈总认为人应该在土地上 留点记号
My ma felt a man oughta make his scratch on the land...

1344
02:01:38,049 --> 02:01:41,017
在离开时 留下不同风貌
...and leave it a little different than when he come.

1345
02:01:41,154 --> 02:01:43,951
总之，谢谢你帮我处理酋长的事
Anyway, thanks for fixin' things with the chief.

1346
02:01:44,024 --> 02:01:45,547
我？我可没处理什么事
Me? I fixed nothin'.

1347
02:01:45,626 --> 02:01:48,423
我只是代你传话罢了 并不代表能事成
You put the words in my mouth but that won't make 'em come true.

1348
02:01:48,497 --> 02:01:52,262
杰梭罗，我说过我必须维持和平
I said what I had to, to keep the peace. I know there's a risk.

1349
02:01:52,334 --> 02:01:54,824
- 我知道会有风险 - 风险？
Risks? Maybe you don't understand.

1350
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:55,475
或许你并不明白

1351
02:01:55,605 --> 02:01:58,573
你刚才已经郑重承诺你的话
You pledged your word back there. Not mine, not the Army's...

1352
02:01:58,644 --> 02:02:00,167
那不是我的，不是军队的 也不是铁路公司的话
...not the railroad's.

1353
02:02:00,245 --> 02:02:02,474
是你告诉他们 他们能够保有原来的狩猎之地
It was your word that told 'em they'd keep their huntin' grounds.

1354
02:02:02,547 --> 02:02:03,843
- 我认为他们会的
I think they will.

1355
02:02:03,949 --> 02:02:06,917
- 我认为你好比把头伸出去…
I think you've got your neck stuck out like a prairie chicken...

1356
02:02:06,985 --> 02:02:09,646
像一只待宰的鸡 等着人来宰你的头
...waitin' for one side or the other to chop it off.

1357
02:02:09,892 --> 02:02:12,359
你老爸当初和我一再地被人 赶出荒地…
Your pa and me got kicked out of one territory after another...

1358
02:02:12,427 --> 02:02:16,089
一堆人蜂拥而至 终结狩猎，建设乡镇
...with people pourin' in, killin' off game, puttin' up towns....

1359
02:02:16,232 --> 02:02:17,630
这股风潮是不会停止的
It ain't gonna stop.

1360
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:22,326
你的合约将会被人破坏 我不想留在这里看它发生
Your treaty's gonna get broken and I don't wanna be around to see it happen.

1361
02:02:22,572 --> 02:02:24,971
等你受够了之后再来找我吧
Look me up when you get your bellyful.

1362
02:02:25,244 --> 02:02:27,370
- 你要去哪？ - 回去山上
-Where you goin'? -Back to the mountains.

1363
02:02:27,445 --> 02:02:30,971
与世隔绝的山上 完全没有人烟的地方
To the high lonesome where there ain't no people at all yet.

1364
02:02:31,952 --> 02:02:32,918
再会
So long.

1365
02:02:40,597 --> 02:02:44,896
现在《中太平洋公司》已穿越 喜耶亚山区的屏障…
By now the Central Pacific had broken through the wall of the High Sierras...

1366
02:02:45,102 --> 02:02:48,537
疲惫不堪地往东经过 平坦的内华达州
...and was straining eastward across the flatlands of Nevada.

1367
02:02:49,573 --> 02:02:53,406
而《联合太平洋公司》 多亏与印地安人之间的长期和平相处…
While the Union Pacific, thanks to its long peace with the Indians...

1368
02:02:53,547 --> 02:02:57,175
才能够轻松面对庞大压力 士气高昂地朝另一方向前进
...was able to keep up pressure just as avidly in the opposite direction.

1369
02:03:13,005 --> 02:03:15,996
这场竞争十分刺激 但也同时花费不少…
The competition was exciting, but also costly...

1370
02:03:16,541 --> 02:03:20,943
两家公司都迫不及待想从 已经架设好的铁道开始赚取获利
...and both companies were itching to earn money from tracks already laid.

1371
02:03:35,634 --> 02:03:38,261
- 马儿情况还好吧，杰克？ - 我刚骑时不太好
-Did the horses ride all right, Jake? -No better than I did.

1372
02:03:38,337 --> 02:03:42,534
必须让他们休息一天 才能出发去猎兔子或水牛
We'll have to rest 'em a day before we can start huntin' rabbits, much less buffalo.

1373
02:03:42,641 --> 02:03:44,665
立刻牵他们去喝水
Let's get 'em to water right away.

1374
02:03:44,779 --> 02:03:46,769
你说不会有水牛猎人来
You say no buffalo hunter come.

1375
02:03:47,348 --> 02:03:48,644
白人都是骗子
White man, liar.

1376
02:03:49,151 --> 02:03:50,708
我们再也不替你们侦察了
We scout for you no more!

1377
02:03:57,528 --> 02:03:59,154
你说我们活着的时候都不会来
Not in our lifetime, you said.

1378
02:03:59,229 --> 02:04:02,664
结果跑来一堆水牛猎人和拓荒者
And there they are. The buffalo slaughterers and the settlers.

1379
02:04:03,602 --> 02:04:06,001
好啦，是比我预料得早
All right, it's sooner than I figured.

1380
02:04:06,406 --> 02:04:09,670
但铁路公司没钱了 他们需要钱继续运作
But the railroad's broke. They need money to keep movin' on.

1381
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:12,041
没有人力就没有钱 没有钱就没有铁路
No people, no money. No money, no railroad.

1382
02:04:12,113 --> 02:04:15,172
- 就这么简单 - 那阿拉巴赫族呢？
-It's as simple as that, Lieutenant. -What about the Arapahoes?

1383
02:04:15,248 --> 02:04:18,648
瞧瞧这些人 有半数的人都是从欧洲来的
Take a look at those people. Half of 'em straight from Europe.

1384
02:04:19,323 --> 02:04:21,119
他们会很辛苦 但他们能熬过的
They'll have a rough time but they'll make it.

1385
02:04:21,191 --> 02:04:23,522
你知道他们为何能熬过？
And do you wanna know why they'll make it?

1386
02:04:23,594 --> 02:04:26,289
因为他们肯变通 肯改变自己的生活方式
Because they're willing to change their ways.

1387
02:04:27,366 --> 02:04:30,266
阿拉巴赫族也得改变生活方式才行 如果不肯，他们就完蛋了
The Arapahoes will have to change, too. If they don't, they're finished.

1388
02:04:30,337 --> 02:04:33,134
我知道他们必须改变 将来有天这片土地将被占领…
I know they have to change and some day the land'll be taken over...

1389
02:04:33,207 --> 02:04:35,834
被这些农夫的城镇和牲畜占领
...by these farmers with their towns and their cattle.

1390
02:04:36,109 --> 02:04:37,507
可是不能像这样
But, not like this.

1391
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:40,707
他们没有必要被人摆弄 而我不想被卷入其中
They don't have to be double-crossed, and I don't have to be a part of it!

1392
02:04:40,783 --> 02:04:42,409
你不想，队长？
You don't, Lieutenant?

1393
02:04:43,385 --> 02:04:45,579
你忘记你身上这套制服了？
Aren't you forgetting that uniform?

1394
02:04:45,689 --> 02:04:48,156
没错，金先生，我是想忘掉
That's right, Mr. King, I'm forgetting it!

1395
02:04:48,227 --> 02:04:51,389
如果军队在这里没有任何权限 那我现在就要辞职
If the Army hasn't got any authority out here, I'm resigning. And, now!

1396
02:04:51,497 --> 02:04:53,726
我不认为那样对阿拉巴赫族 有任何帮助
I don't see how that's gonna help the Arapahoes.

1397
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:55,357
没有任何事能帮助他们
Nothing'll help 'em.

1398
02:04:55,534 --> 02:04:57,398
但也没有任何事情能阻止他们
But nothing's gonna stop 'em.

1399
02:05:27,876 --> 02:05:29,274
印地安人来袭！
Indian attack!

1400
02:05:30,231 --> 02:05:31,983
印地安人来袭！找掩护！

1401
02:05:42,563 --> 02:05:43,893
你看看…
Take a good look!

1402
02:05:44,331 --> 02:05:47,663
你想要战争，你可如愿了 我希望你是第一个赔上性命的人
You wanted a war, and you got one. I hope you're the first man killed in it.

1403
02:05:47,769 --> 02:05:49,759
把篷车调头！
Turn those wagons over!

1404
02:06:12,201 --> 02:06:14,691
对准领先的马匹开枪 先拿下酋长！
Shoot for the lead horses. Sergeant, take over.

1405
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:16,336
罗林，你用这个
Rawlings, try that.

1406
02:06:25,784 --> 02:06:27,944
印地安人故意让水牛狂奔逃窜
The Indians are stampeding the buffalo.

1407
02:06:28,187 --> 02:06:29,653
卑鄙小人！ 来吧
Dirty skunks! Come on!

1408
02:08:47,498 --> 02:08:49,761
我告诉过你不会有战争
I told you there'd be no war.

1409
02:08:50,938 --> 02:08:52,063
瞧瞧他们
Look at 'em.

1410
02:08:52,572 --> 02:08:53,731
他们撤退了
They've quit.

1411
02:08:54,807 --> 02:08:56,068
他们会再回来的
They'll be back.

1412
02:08:57,143 --> 02:09:01,909
他们派来野兽来杀死 他们称为“铁马”的怪兽
They just sent a bunch of animals to kill an animal they call the "Iron Horse".

1413
02:09:01,984 --> 02:09:04,110
但那怪兽仍在，可不是？
Well, it's still standin', isn't it?

1414
02:09:04,688 --> 02:09:06,484
没有任何事情能阻止它
And nothin's gonna stop it.

1415
02:09:26,749 --> 02:09:28,773
你看到那样 你的日子还过得下去吗？
You think you can live with that?

1416
02:09:30,019 --> 02:09:32,612
我可以与这情况共生共亡！
I can live with it, or I can die with it.

1417
02:09:32,754 --> 02:09:33,879
你听看看…
Just listen!

1418
02:09:34,759 --> 02:09:36,453
你这样还能过得下去吗？
You can live with that?

1419
02:09:37,829 --> 02:09:38,886
那个？
That?

1420
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:40,596
那才不是哭声
That ain't cryin'.

1421
02:09:41,067 --> 02:09:42,966
那只是新生命继续存活的声音
That's just new life goin' on.

1422
02:09:49,077 --> 02:09:53,035
把这女人扶起来 然后把其他受伤的人抬进帐篷里
Pick up this woman and put the rest of the engine in the shed.

1423
02:09:58,656 --> 02:10:02,091
嘿，马文…剩下的人回去工作！ 我们还得继续造铁路！
The rest of you, back to work. We've got a railroad to build.

1424
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:02,128


1425
02:10:55,347 --> 02:10:57,099
这个嘛…

1426
02:10:57,533 --> 02:10:59,864
看来你终于已经受够了
It looks like you finally got your bellyful.

1427
02:10:59,935 --> 02:11:01,060
哈罗，杰梭罗
Hello, Jethro.

1428
02:11:02,303 --> 02:11:04,065
看来你过得还不错
Appears you're doin' well.

1429
02:11:05,241 --> 02:11:06,673
还可以
Can't complain.

1430
02:11:07,243 --> 02:11:10,837
溪里满满都是海狸 争先恐后挤进陷阱里
Creek's loaded with beavers, fightin' their way into the trap.

1431
02:11:11,750 --> 02:11:13,273
没有白人指使我做事
Ain't no white men lookin' over my shoulder...

1432
02:11:13,352 --> 02:11:15,546
印地安人都对我很友善
...and the Indians are plumb cordial.

1433
02:11:16,555 --> 02:11:19,318
把你的东西放进去 这地方够两个人住的
Toss your stuff in there. Plenty of room for two.

1434
02:11:19,561 --> 02:11:20,584
谢谢
Thanks.

1435
02:11:22,230 --> 02:11:23,560
你就睡在那边
You'll be bunkin' yonder.

1436
02:11:23,631 --> 02:11:26,224
熟悉一下环境 以便待会儿需要什么就可以找到
Better take your bearin's now, so you can find it when you need it.

1437
02:11:26,302 --> 02:11:29,099
你若不习惯我打呼 你明天可以自己盖一间木屋
If you don't like my snorin' you can build your own cabin tomorrow.

1438
02:11:29,172 --> 02:11:30,729
我帮你打点里面
I'll furnish the axe.

1439
02:11:33,112 --> 02:11:34,669
- 谢谢，我只是路过而已
Thanks. I'm just passin' through.

1440
02:11:34,779 --> 02:11:36,040
- 路过去哪？
Through to where?

1441
02:11:36,714 --> 02:11:38,908
你所到之处都是去过的地方
Anywhere you go is like where you've been.

1442
02:11:38,950 --> 02:11:41,747
你在那边受的伤害还不够？
Ain't you lost enough tail feathers back there?

1443
02:11:43,356 --> 02:11:45,016
我是受过一点伤
I've been plucked some.

1444
02:11:46,292 --> 02:11:48,282
但那便是我喜欢这个国家的原因
But that's what I like about this country.

1445
02:11:48,330 --> 02:11:50,820
另一座山丘的草永远都比较绿
There's always greener grass over the next hill.

1446
02:11:51,667 --> 02:11:54,260
打从那该死铁路经过之后 再也不是了
Not no more. Not since that damn railroad come.

1447
02:11:54,638 --> 02:11:57,868
所有牧草都被人管东锁了起来
All the grass is bein' staked out now, with a lock on it.

1448
02:12:00,276 --> 02:12:03,870
或许我得再爬高一点的山丘 才能找到
Maybe I'll just have to climb a little higher hill to find it.

1449
02:12:06,887 --> 02:12:08,353
要不要一起来？
How about comin' along?

1450
02:12:08,622 --> 02:12:09,849
你疯了？
Are you crazy?

1451
02:12:10,891 --> 02:12:14,257
就像印地安人说的： “这些石头和树木都不想搬家”
Like the Indians say, "These rocks and trees around here feel no call to move.

1452
02:12:14,329 --> 02:12:15,795
“凭什么我要搬呢？”
"Why should I?"

1453
02:12:17,233 --> 02:12:19,257
我或许不是印地安人，杰梭罗…
Guess I'm not an Indian, Jethro.

1454
02:12:19,969 --> 02:12:22,095
我也不是石头或树木…
And I'm sure not a rock nor a tree.

1455
02:12:22,942 --> 02:12:25,774
但物以类聚 不管愿不愿意
A man belongs with his own kind, like him or not.

1456
02:13:02,057 --> 02:13:06,356
铁路的来临为沿路的土地 带来了许多改变
The coming of railroads brought changes in the land through which they passed.

1457
02:13:06,497 --> 02:13:10,296
现在成群牛羊聚集 绵延数百哩之长…
Now, immense herds of cattle were driven hundreds of miles to meet the lines...

1458
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,390
朝东边的市集前进
...bound for markets in the East.

1459
02:13:12,904 --> 02:13:15,497
原野上竖立起篱笆 牛羊被圈围起来…
Fences went up, cattle trails were barred...

1460
02:13:16,142 --> 02:13:20,100
畜牧业者和拓荒者之间长久以来 存在着血腥斗争…
...and a long and bloody wrangle began between cattlemen and homesteaders.

1461
02:13:20,748 --> 02:13:24,410
法令是由那些射枪 最快最准的人决定的
The law was in the hands of whoever could shoot fast and straight...

1462
02:13:24,985 --> 02:13:28,511
不过有些人也会执意出面 当法令代言人
...except where there was somebody determined to stand for law.

1463
02:13:29,259 --> 02:13:33,092
有些人看到羊群可能会觉得 很具有田园风光
Others might look on sheep and a shepherd as a pastoral scene.

1464
02:13:35,833 --> 02:13:37,265
但畜牧业者可不这么想
But not the cattleman.

1465
02:13:37,335 --> 02:13:41,361
对他们而言，羊把草吃光 而青草得之不易
To him, sheep destroyed grass, and grass came dear.

1466
02:13:43,076 --> 02:13:45,908
如果某个人的性命 比草还不值钱…
And if a man's life were held cheaper than grass...

1467
02:13:46,045 --> 02:13:49,275
那只会被视为战争死伤 而非触犯杀人罪
...it was considered a casualty of war, not a crime.

1468
02:13:50,085 --> 02:13:51,381
在所有争端事件当中
And, in all this...

1469
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:54,511
唯一以寡敌众的便是那些佩戴警徽的人
...the man with the star was only one against many.

1470
02:13:56,226 --> 02:13:59,092
但那些非法之徒日子愈来愈难过…
But time was running out for the reckless ones...

1471
02:13:59,164 --> 02:14:02,155
即那些亡命之徒 那些持枪犯案的小子
...the desperadoes, the gallop-and-gunshot boys...

1472
02:14:03,101 --> 02:14:05,933
因为有愈来愈多老百姓 开始要求大家遵行法令
...as more and more citizens demanded respect for the law...

1473
02:14:06,004 --> 02:14:08,938
并以身作则随时回击 以维护法令尊严
...and showed themselves ready to fight to uphold it.

1474
02:14:08,978 --> 02:14:12,378
这些在西部陆续成立的新城镇 都开始梦想…
And the raw new towns that sprung up in the West began to dream...

1475
02:14:12,447 --> 02:14:16,780
有天能成为在金门畔 曾经被视为流氓城市的那个地方
...of becoming as refined as that one-time hooligan city by the Golden Gate.

1476
02:14:17,353 --> 02:14:19,445
旧金山现在变得繁华热闹…
San Francisco was now respectable.

1477
02:14:19,957 --> 02:14:23,551
文明优雅到甚至有人拍卖华厦
So sophisticated, in fact, it even had mansions up for auction.

1478
02:14:24,063 --> 02:14:25,256
两千元！
$2,000.

1479
02:14:25,931 --> 02:14:27,192
两千元！
$2,000.

1480
02:14:28,066 --> 02:14:29,532
那是最后一次出价？
Is that your last bid?

1481
02:14:30,271 --> 02:14:34,206
各位先生女士 这奖杯可是纯黄金打造，还刻着…
Ladies and gentlemen, this trophy is solid gold and fully inscribed.

1482
02:14:35,141 --> 02:14:39,270
“克里夫凡伟伦 旧金山至堪萨斯市铁路公司董事长”
"Mr. Cleve van Valen, President of the San Francisco--Kansas City Railroad."

1483
02:14:40,217 --> 02:14:42,616
这可是他心爱的个人收藏
It's a treasure he held dear to his heart.

1484
02:14:43,187 --> 02:14:46,155
有没有人出价三千买这无价收藏？
Do I hear $3,000 for this priceless possession?

1485
02:14:47,257 --> 02:14:48,883
无价个头啦…
Priceless, my foot.

1486
02:14:49,827 --> 02:14:51,487
我们当初拿它当门挡
We used it for a doorstop.

1487
02:14:52,499 --> 02:14:53,465
- 两千五百元！ - 两千五百元！
$2,500.

1488
02:14:53,533 --> 02:14:55,022
两千五百元！
$2,500.

1489
02:14:55,337 --> 02:14:57,172


1490
02:14:58,506 --> 02:15:00,097
两千五百元？两千五百元卖出！
Sold. $2,500.

1491
02:15:00,843 --> 02:15:02,434
真是令人难过的一天，莉莉丝
It's a sad day, Lilith.

1492
02:15:03,012 --> 02:15:04,035
难过？
Sad?

1493
02:15:04,615 --> 02:15:07,276
我们大赚大花三次财富
We made and spent three fortunes together.

1494
02:15:07,384 --> 02:15:09,112
有什么好难过的？
What's so sad about that?

1495
02:15:09,853 --> 02:15:13,310
如果他再多活久一点 我们有可能再赚再花一次
If he'd lived a little longer we would've made and spent another.

1496
02:15:13,393 --> 02:15:15,917
- 对不起，凡伟伦夫人 - 什么事？
-I beg your pardon, Mrs. van Valen. -What?

1497
02:15:15,994 --> 02:15:17,961
那把椅子已经卖出了，很抱歉
The chair, it's been sold. I'm sorry.

1498
02:15:18,030 --> 02:15:20,554
那就拿去吧 别道歉，尽管拿去
Well then, take it. Quit apologizin' and take it.

1499
02:15:20,634 --> 02:15:21,998
谢谢，夫人
Thank you, madam.

1500
02:15:22,071 --> 02:15:24,470
如果有别的方法可以偿还债务的话…
If there had been some other way to pay off the debts....

1501
02:15:24,539 --> 02:15:26,005
不要紧的
It doesn't matter.

1502
02:15:26,275 --> 02:15:29,266
我有两件东西是没有人能拿走的…
I've got two things no one can ever take from me:

1503
02:15:30,413 --> 02:15:32,880
这个和我在亚利桑那州的土地
This, and my land in Arizona.

1504
02:15:34,186 --> 02:15:36,551
莉莉丝，我不想泼你冷水…
Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes...

1505
02:15:37,356 --> 02:15:39,482
可是那农场根本不值钱
...but that ranch is nearly worthless.

1506
02:15:39,626 --> 02:15:41,183
但总是一块地，不是吗？
Well, it's there, isn't it?

1507
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:44,285
是的，但大多数畜牲都卖掉或被偷了
Yes, but most of the cattle have been sold off or stolen.

1508
02:15:44,365 --> 02:15:45,558
- 牛羊再买就是了
I'll get cattle.

1509
02:15:45,633 --> 02:15:47,998
- 你将需要有人帮忙做事- 有人帮你经营农场
You'll need someone to work it and manage it for you.

1510
02:15:48,071 --> 02:15:50,038
- 我会找人的  找谁？
-I'll get that, too. -Who?

1511
02:15:50,906 --> 02:15:53,999
我的侄子 他在当骑警
My nephew. He's a marshal out there somewhere.

1512
02:15:51,018 --> 02:15:55,064


1513
02:15:55,046 --> 02:15:57,707
莉莉丝，你这把年纪 那种日子可能会很辛苦
Lilith, at your age it might be kind of rough.

1514
02:15:59,349 --> 02:16:00,372
辛苦？
Rough?

1515
02:16:01,153 --> 02:16:04,918
我爸妈当初为了寻找土地 在河上航行遇难而死
My ma and pa were killed goin' down the river just lookin' for land.

1516
02:16:06,426 --> 02:16:10,259
我想我多少还是有 普莱斯考特家的遗传
I guess I got a little of that Prescott blood in me after all.

1517
02:16:19,577 --> 02:16:20,565
爸？
Pa?

1518
02:16:21,244 --> 02:16:24,178
莉莉丝姨婆在诺布丘的家 和那一样高吗？
Is Aunt Lilith's house on Nob Hill as high as that?

1519
02:16:26,486 --> 02:16:27,952
我不知道，儿子
I don't know, son.

1520
02:16:28,254 --> 02:16:31,416
待会儿回家，你可以问莉莉丝姨婆 她会告诉你
On our way home you ask your Aunt Lilith. She'll tell you.

1521
02:17:20,822 --> 02:17:23,221
亲爱的？你想你认得出她吗？
Honey? Do you think you'll know her?

1522
02:17:23,658 --> 02:17:24,351
- 什么？
What?

1523
02:17:24,425 --> 02:17:26,824
- 你的莉莉丝阿姨- 你想你可以认得出她吗？
Your Aunt Lilith. Do you think you'll recognize her?

1524
02:17:27,029 --> 02:17:28,086
- 当然
Sure.

1525
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:30,459
齐伯？怎么回事？
Zeb? What's the matter?

1526
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:33,058
没事
Nothing.

1527
02:17:33,138 --> 02:17:34,126
走吧
Come on.

1528
02:17:40,711 --> 02:17:42,504
谢谢

1529
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:45,299
（黄金城交界处）

1530
02:17:47,589 --> 02:17:49,522
- 请问你是莉莉丝姨婆吗？
Ma'am, are you our Great Aunt Lilith?

1531
02:17:49,557 --> 02:17:51,717
- 如果你们是齐伯的孩子，我就是
If you're Zeb's children, I am.

1532
02:17:54,599 --> 02:17:55,587
- 莉莉丝
Lilith.

1533
02:17:56,534 --> 02:17:57,557
- 齐伯
Zeb.

1534
02:17:58,402 --> 02:17:59,868
齐伯罗林
Zeb Rawlings.

1535
02:18:01,207 --> 02:18:02,366
喔，老天
Oh, goodness.

1536
02:18:02,742 --> 02:18:05,733
我一再叮咛自己绝对不准哭的
I swore up and down I wasn't gonna cry.

1537
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:08,512
你就像妈形容的那么美丽
You're just as pretty as Ma said you was.

1538
02:18:09,383 --> 02:18:11,612
这位是我的太太，茱莉
I'd like you to meet my wife, Julie.

1539
02:18:11,754 --> 02:18:13,277
很高兴认识你
Pleased to meet you.

1540
02:18:13,356 --> 02:18:15,380
我也很高兴认识你
And I'm pleased to meet you, too.

1541
02:18:15,725 --> 02:18:18,090
我简直无法形容我有多开心
I just can't tell you how pleased.

1542
02:18:19,128 --> 02:18:21,857
这是伊芙，我们家的老么
This here's Eve, underneath all the jam.

1543
02:18:22,269 --> 02:18:24,361
- 过来见见山姆 - 山姆？
-Come on and meet Sam now. -Sam?

1544
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:28,164
山姆是我们的马 他可以一次拉两台篷车喔
Sam's our horse. He could pull two wagons if he wanted.

1545
02:18:28,508 --> 02:18:32,273
喔，对不起，失陪了 我得去见过山姆呢
Well, if you'll excuse me, I have my orders to meet Sam.

1546
02:18:32,313 --> 02:18:33,404
走吧
Come on.

1547
02:18:33,714 --> 02:18:35,305
- 喔，慢一点啊，孩子 - 他在另外一头
Just a minute now, boys.

1548
02:18:35,416 --> 02:18:37,474
- 走吧 - 好的
But he's on the other side. Come on.

1549
02:18:39,722 --> 02:18:42,155
- 走吧 - 等一下
I think this means a whole lot to her.

1550
02:18:39,978 --> 02:18:42,189
我认为这对她意义重大

1551
02:18:42,224 --> 02:18:44,555
你不晓得这对我有多重要…
You have no idea how much it means to me...

1552
02:18:44,796 --> 02:18:47,855
能够安顿下来 过着与世无争的日子
...to be able to settle down to a life of peace and quiet.

1553
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:50,356
我去拿行李
I'll get the luggage.

1554
02:18:53,784 --> 02:18:55,827
哈罗，各位！

1555
02:18:55,994 --> 02:18:57,746
杰克！

1556
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,164
汤姆

1557
02:18:59,331 --> 02:19:01,041
帕布洛

1558
02:19:11,296 --> 02:19:13,286
齐伯，咱们走吧
Zeb, let's go.

1559
02:19:13,846 --> 02:19:19,935


1560
02:19:15,568 --> 02:19:19,264
骑警，别告诉我你大老远跑来黄金城 是为了来见我？
Don't tell me you come all the way to Gold City just to meet me?

1561
02:19:19,841 --> 02:19:21,364
我根本没想到
I hardly expected it.

1562
02:19:22,876 --> 02:19:25,742
这位是美丽的罗林太太？
And the beautiful Mrs. Rawlings?

1563
02:19:27,184 --> 02:19:28,445
真是无上荣幸
What a pleasure.

1564
02:19:29,318 --> 02:19:33,185
我真嫉妒你，骑警 一个年轻貌美的老婆…
I envy you, Marshal, a well-favored, bright-eyed wife...

1565
02:19:33,691 --> 02:19:36,454
就像太阳一般耀眼灿烂
...just as dazzlin' as that sun up there.

1566
02:19:38,530 --> 02:19:40,963
让人心存感激，可不是？
It makes you almost thankful, don't it?

1567
02:19:41,201 --> 02:19:43,327
让人很想好好活下去
It makes a person wanna live.

1568
02:19:44,704 --> 02:19:45,692
再见
Adios.

1569
02:19:49,979 --> 02:19:51,536
那是查理葛兰特
That's Charlie Gant.

1570
02:19:51,748 --> 02:19:54,215
我以为你说他在蒙大拿州
I thought you said he was in Montana?

1571
02:19:54,417 --> 02:19:55,474
齐伯？
Zeb?

1572
02:19:56,285 --> 02:19:58,684
我只是去拿行李，没事
I'm just gonna get the luggage, that's all.

1573
02:20:08,237 --> 02:20:09,760
你去办入房手续吧，茱莉
See to the rooms, will you, Julie?

1574
02:20:09,838 --> 02:20:12,533
- 普莱斯考特，照顾马 - 好的
-Prescott, take care of the horses. -Yes, sir.

1575
02:20:12,607 --> 02:20:15,006
- 奈勒斯，去帮你妈妈 - 好的
-Linus, help your mother. -Yes, sir.

1576
02:20:22,387 --> 02:20:24,047
什么事不对劲吗，茱莉？
Anything wrong, Julie?

1577
02:20:24,589 --> 02:20:26,749
没…没事
No. No, nothing.

1578
02:20:27,458 --> 02:20:28,617
走吧，伊芙
Come on, Eve.

1579
02:20:36,011 --> 02:20:38,513
- 卢 - 齐伯

1580
02:20:38,606 --> 02:20:39,799
有时间吗？
Got a minute?

1581
02:20:40,277 --> 02:20:41,868
我当然有时间
Of course, I got a minute.

1582
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:45,646
来…

1583
02:20:45,812 --> 02:20:48,357
我郑重劝告你应该要…

1584
02:20:48,419 --> 02:20:49,908
- 抽雪茄？ - 不，谢谢
-Cigar? -No, thanks.

1585
02:20:51,458 --> 02:20:53,084
有什么事我能帮你呢？
Well, what can I do for you?

1586
02:20:55,295 --> 02:20:56,625
你尽管说吧
Go ahead, name it.

1587
02:20:56,665 --> 02:20:59,098
我今天早上看到葛兰特下火车
I saw Gant get off the train this morning.

1588
02:20:59,767 --> 02:21:01,961
有三个人去接他
There were three men waiting for him.

1589
02:21:05,442 --> 02:21:07,102
那是你跑来的原因，是吧？
That's why you're here, huh?

1590
02:21:08,411 --> 02:21:09,434
没错
That's it.

1591
02:21:12,319 --> 02:21:14,582
我们根本没有任何办法…
Look, there ain't a thing we can do...

1592
02:21:14,754 --> 02:21:18,655
阻止查理葛兰特在这地区的活动
...to keep Charlie Gant from goin' where he wants to in this territory.

1593
02:21:20,093 --> 02:21:22,617
我知道 我知道他的为人…
I know. I know what he was...

1594
02:21:24,031 --> 02:21:25,691
但现在已经结束了
...but that's over now.

1595
02:21:26,703 --> 02:21:28,863
这一切早已结束 当他哥哥…
It was over the day his brother got--

1596
02:21:31,007 --> 02:21:33,634
那天应该两个都杀的 但是…
You should've killed 'em both that day, but....

1597
02:21:34,679 --> 02:21:37,806
但你没有 现在我真的一点办法都没了
Well, you didn't and there ain't a thing I can do about it now.

1598
02:21:37,883 --> 02:21:40,715
他来这里做什么，卢？ 你难道不好奇吗？
What's he doin' here, Lou? Ain't you even curious?

1599
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:44,377
你要我怎么做？ 拿枪抵住他把他赶出城？
What do you want me to do? Run him out of town at the point of a gun?

1600
02:21:44,459 --> 02:21:47,052
你想我们仍用手枪执行法律？
Do you think it will put the law inside a holster here?

1601
02:21:47,129 --> 02:21:49,688
你看那边，齐伯 那才是法律
Look over there, Zeb. There's the law.

1602
02:21:50,565 --> 02:21:53,032
那些条文规定才是法律…
With all its writs and decrees and....

1603
02:21:54,373 --> 02:21:56,499
- 我们现在隶属巡回法院管辖
We abide by that circuit judge, now.

1604
02:21:56,574 --> 02:21:58,006
- 但在此同时有多少人被杀？
How many get killed meantime?

1605
02:21:58,075 --> 02:22:02,670
没有人被杀 不会有人被杀  达克哈立戴，克兰顿，杨格斯…
Nobody's got killed. Nobody's goin' to. Doc Halliday, the Clantons, the Youngers....

1606
02:22:00,345 --> 02:22:03,598


1607
02:22:03,918 --> 02:22:05,111
- 他们全都死了
They're all gone now.

1608
02:22:05,385 --> 02:22:07,045
- 查理葛兰特并没死
Charlie Gant ain't gone.

1609
02:22:08,924 --> 02:22:11,483
你去弄来拘捕令 我就去抓葛兰特
You get me a warrant. I'll get you Gant.

1610
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:16,061
卢？明天运送黄金的篷车队 需要三名护卫
Lou, they want three guards in the wagon with the gold shipment tomorrow.

1611
02:22:16,099 --> 02:22:17,087
- 三名？
Three?

1612
02:22:17,167 --> 02:22:19,930
- 是宗大案子，市价超过十万元
This is a big one. Over $100,000 worth.

1613
02:22:20,970 --> 02:22:23,631
我带克雷顿和辛姆斯去，好吧？
I'll take Clayton and Sims with me. All right?

1614
02:22:28,416 --> 02:22:29,211
怎么样？
Well?

1615
02:22:30,083 --> 02:22:31,208
什么怎么样？
Well what?

1616
02:22:32,152 --> 02:22:34,210
那对你不代表任何意义吗？
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

1617
02:22:34,454 --> 02:22:37,445
- 那代表我们需要派三名护卫 - 在火车上！
-It means we put on a three-man guard. -To the train.

1618
02:22:37,994 --> 02:22:39,426
那到时候呢？
What happens then?

1619
02:22:40,463 --> 02:22:42,953
我们这里每个月都会运送黄金出去
You know there's gold goin' out of here every month or so.

1620
02:22:43,067 --> 02:22:46,058
自从杰西詹姆士被杀之后 再没有火车被劫事件
There hasn't been a train robbery since Jesse James was killed.

1621
02:22:47,809 --> 02:22:50,812
如果律师们需要私下会谈 我们可以谈一下

1622
02:22:50,979 --> 02:22:52,481
齐伯

1623
02:22:53,846 --> 02:22:55,904
我不想惹任何麻烦
I don't want any trouble here, now.

1624
02:22:55,982 --> 02:22:57,972
咱们是很久的朋友了
We've been friends a long time.

1625
02:22:58,587 --> 02:22:59,746
身为朋友…
As a friend...

1626
02:23:00,789 --> 02:23:02,722
我想请你离开这里
...l'd like you to leave town.

1627
02:23:24,954 --> 02:23:26,784
孩子们，给我过来！
Boys, get back from there!

1628
02:23:30,193 --> 02:23:31,887
你自己往下看
Look down there, son.

1629
02:23:32,097 --> 02:23:34,496
你知道这底下有多深吗？
Do you know how deep that shaft is?

1630
02:23:34,832 --> 02:23:36,662
有一千尺深
That's 1,000 foot deep.

1631
02:23:36,834 --> 02:23:38,960
你知道一千尺有多深吗？
Do you know how deep 1,000 foot is?

1632
02:23:40,541 --> 02:23:43,941
如果把两百个弟弟摆在你肩膀上…
If you had 200 brothers, all standin' on your shoulders...

1633
02:23:44,110 --> 02:23:45,974
- 你还是看不到最上面
...you wouldn't be able to see over the top.

1634
02:23:46,048 --> 02:23:47,514
- 那我不就被压扁了！
I'd be squished.

1635
02:23:48,216 --> 02:23:50,877
走吧，我带你们去看发动机
Come on. I'll show you boys the donkey engine.

1636
02:23:57,127 --> 02:23:59,788
你们先过去 我马上就来
You boys go ahead. I'll be along in a minute.

1637
02:24:02,936 --> 02:24:06,336
（黄金城金矿）听说你跑去找当地骑警谈我的事
I hear you've been talkin' to the local marshal about me.

1638
02:24:03,218 --> 02:24:06,721


1639
02:24:08,675 --> 02:24:10,335
- 此举可真友善
Would you call that friendly?

1640
02:24:10,546 --> 02:24:12,843
- 我从不认为我们的关系是友善的
I never considered us exactly friendly.

1641
02:24:13,082 --> 02:24:14,878
我不喜欢你，骑警
I don't like you, Marshal.

1642
02:24:15,352 --> 02:24:18,912
我不喜欢你们这种人在这国家 所做的一切
I don't like what you and your kind are doin' to this country.

1643
02:24:19,789 --> 02:24:21,346
我不想惹麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

1644
02:24:22,061 --> 02:24:25,257
可是你执意要用从前的标准来看 就你和我？
You wanna put things on the old basis, just you and me?

1645
02:24:26,698 --> 02:24:27,789
那无所谓
That's fine.

1646
02:24:28,969 --> 02:24:31,630
我不打算和你争执，葛兰特
I'm not gonna get in a fight with you, Gant.

1647
02:24:32,907 --> 02:24:35,170
那你是想要和平罗，骑警？
It's peace you want, Marshal?

1648
02:24:35,745 --> 02:24:36,733
和平？
Peace?

1649
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:39,370
我只知道一种和平
There's only one kind I know of.

1650
02:24:40,782 --> 02:24:42,840
就是我哥哥得到的那种
That's the kind my brother's got.

1651
02:24:43,122 --> 02:24:46,750
你哥哥的遭遇并没有让你 学到太多教训，是吧？
What happened to your brother didn't teach you very much, did it?

1652
02:24:47,092 --> 02:24:48,388
放轻松，骑警…
Easy, Marshal.

1653
02:24:49,695 --> 02:24:51,389
佛洛依从未出过差错…
Floyd never made mistakes...

1654
02:24:51,697 --> 02:24:53,926
除了那次他误信你…
...except the one time he trusted you.

1655
02:24:55,002 --> 02:24:57,060
让你成了漏网之鱼
And you're the one that got away.

1656
02:25:00,675 --> 02:25:04,132
总有一天 我会去府上好好拜访你们
One of these days I'm likely to pay you Rawlings' a little visit.

1657
02:25:31,014 --> 02:25:33,225
快点！走吧！

1658
02:25:33,391 --> 02:25:35,727
把黄金箱子抬上来！

1659
02:25:35,894 --> 02:25:38,021
很多黄金

1660
02:25:38,188 --> 02:25:40,774
快点，继续搬，各位！

1661
02:25:43,151 --> 02:25:44,486
齐伯？

1662
02:25:44,698 --> 02:25:46,062
卢莱姆西来了
Lou Ramsey's here.

1663
02:25:48,865 --> 02:25:50,492
卢

1664
02:25:51,073 --> 02:25:53,700
- 我警告过你，齐伯 - 什么事？
-I warned you, Zeb. -What is it?

1665
02:25:54,144 --> 02:25:56,111
葛兰特昨晚跑来找我
Gant came to see me last night.

1666
02:25:56,415 --> 02:25:59,144
说你试图找他麻烦
He said you tried to start some trouble with him.

1667
02:25:59,853 --> 02:26:01,114
你相信他？
You believe him?

1668
02:26:01,387 --> 02:26:04,822
我告诉你，齐伯 你要惹麻烦，到你自己的地盘去搞！
I'm tellin' you, Zeb, you take your trouble to your own territory.

1669
02:26:04,857 --> 02:26:06,881
我这里不要有任何麻烦
I don't want any more of it here.

1670
02:26:09,732 --> 02:26:12,700
不会有任何麻烦，卢 葛兰特走了
There won't be any more trouble, Lou. Gant's gone.

1671
02:26:13,703 --> 02:26:15,966
今天一大早就离开出城了
He rode out of here early this mornin'.

1672
02:26:16,339 --> 02:26:17,327
和谁？
With who?

1673
02:26:17,375 --> 02:26:18,705
他的道上兄弟
His gang.

1674
02:26:19,877 --> 02:26:23,334
他们现在应该在 这里和金曼之间的某个地方…
They should be somewhere between here and Kingman...

1675
02:26:24,383 --> 02:26:26,043
等火车出现
...waitin' on that train.

1676
02:26:26,118 --> 02:26:28,108
你别想唬我，齐伯
You don't fool me for a minute, Zeb.

1677
02:26:28,189 --> 02:26:30,850
你并不是想破抢案 你是想抓葛兰特
You're not lookin' for a robbery, you're lookin' for Gant.

1678
02:26:30,958 --> 02:26:34,120
你身上仍有他射你的子弹 那是在德州
You still carry lead where he shot you. That was Texas.

1679
02:26:34,394 --> 02:26:37,362
还有在奥克拉荷马你射杀佛洛依 现在换这件事！
And Oklahoma, where you killed Floyd. And now this.

1680
02:26:39,970 --> 02:26:41,334
很抱歉，茱莉…
I'm sorry, Julie...

1681
02:26:42,173 --> 02:26:45,073
我们局里不要和这件事有关
...but I don't want my office to be any part of this.

1682
02:26:56,758 --> 02:26:59,185
齐伯，孩子们已经把东西都准备好了
The boys have got the team hitched.

1684
02:26:59,762 --> 02:27:00,887
我知道
I know.

1685
02:27:01,196 --> 02:27:03,095
差不多时候该走了
It's almost time to go.

1686
02:27:07,485 --> 02:27:09,237
齐伯？

1687
02:27:34,073 --> 02:27:36,097
- 茱莉 - 没有人要你去对付葛兰特
No one's askin' you to face Gant.

1688
02:27:36,175 --> 02:27:37,607
没有人逼你
No one's makin' you.

1689
02:27:38,177 --> 02:27:41,168
我们可以马上离开这里 我们可以忘掉这一切
We could ride out of here right now. We could forget it.

1690
02:27:45,019 --> 02:27:47,486
或许你有什么事情没告诉我
Maybe there's somethin' you haven't told me.

1691
02:27:48,957 --> 02:27:50,116
是吗，齐伯？
Is there, Zeb?

1692
02:27:54,933 --> 02:27:56,490
我求你别去
I'm askin' you not to go.

1693
02:27:58,335 --> 02:27:59,460
求求你
Please.

1694
02:28:00,406 --> 02:28:01,838
别去
Don't go.

1695
02:28:04,078 --> 02:28:05,408
对不起，茱莉…
Sorry, Julie.

1696
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:27,636
再也没有比男人的荣誉感 更顽固的东西
I guess there's nothin' more pigheaded in a man than his sense of honor.

1697
02:28:29,276 --> 02:28:32,244
男人全都一个样 每个都是如此
They're all the same, every one of 'em.

1698
02:28:33,147 --> 02:28:35,171
就拿我的克里夫来说好了
You take my Cleve now.

1699
02:28:35,352 --> 02:28:37,911
他从来不肯错过任何扑克牌局
Never could turn down a poker game.

1700
02:28:38,054 --> 02:28:39,987
义无反顾一定要去
He felt duty bound to go.

1701
02:28:40,222 --> 02:28:45,056
有时还连玩三个晚上 但他就是不肯罢休…
Three nights runnin' sometimes, but he wouldn't quit, not if his life depended on it.

1702
02:28:42,956 --> 02:28:46,042
即便要他的命也一样 他…

1703
02:28:47,533 --> 02:28:49,466
我想这一点也不好笑
I guess it isn't very funny.

1704
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:50,502
妈？
Ma!

1705
02:28:51,604 --> 02:28:52,627
爸爸呢？
Where's Pa?

1706
02:28:52,906 --> 02:28:55,430
- 他出去了 - 妈怎么了？
-Out. That's where he is. -What's the matter with Mom?

1707
02:28:55,507 --> 02:28:58,441
没事…来吧…到另一个房间
Nothin's the matter. Come on, now, in the other room.

1708
02:28:58,514 --> 02:29:00,413
- 怎么回事？ - 快点，我们想要玩！
Come on, darlin', we're gonna play.

1709
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:02,542
乖女孩…这样才对
That's a good girl. That's better.

1710
02:29:02,584 --> 02:29:05,279
- 妈妈怎么了？ - 没怎么
-What's the matter with Mama? -Nothin's the matter.

1711
02:29:05,354 --> 02:29:06,445
你们会玩游戏吗？
You know any games?

1712
02:29:06,524 --> 02:29:08,423
- 我们会玩捉鬼 - 大风吹！
-We know tag. -Musical chairs.

1713
02:29:08,927 --> 02:29:10,359
- 捉鬼 - 我知道躲迷藏
I know hide and seek.

1714
02:29:10,629 --> 02:29:13,290
你们会玩扑克牌吗？
-Do you know how to play poker? -Poker?

1715
02:29:13,399 --> 02:29:17,391
- 扑克牌？ - 扑克牌？
You're in luck. Get down right there. Now come on, sit down. That's it.

1716
02:29:13,528 --> 02:29:17,240
算你们走运，坐下来 过来，坐下，很好

1717
02:29:17,473 --> 02:29:19,440
可是我们不会玩扑克牌
But we don't know how to play poker.

1718
02:29:19,540 --> 02:29:21,336
所以你们才要学啊
Well, it's time you learned.

1719
02:29:22,110 --> 02:29:25,135
首先，我们一人分五张牌…
First, we'll start off with a little five-card stud.

1720
02:29:44,171 --> 02:29:45,967
你的来福枪给我，齐伯
I'll take that rifle, Zeb.

1721
02:29:46,441 --> 02:29:47,964
还有你的手枪
Your pistol, too.

1722
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:52,105
对不起，卢…
Sorry, Lou.

1723
02:29:53,217 --> 02:29:54,615
我无法照做
I just can't oblige.

1724
02:30:04,164 --> 02:30:07,155
我以为现在的法律不容许你那样做
I thought the law wouldn't let you use that any more.

1725
02:30:07,501 --> 02:30:09,229
如果必要的话 我会那么做
I'll use it if I have to.

1726
02:30:09,670 --> 02:30:12,729
我要离开这里，卢 我要带这个走
I'm goin' out of here, Lou, and I'm takin' this with me.

1727
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:14,771
去杀葛兰特！
To kill Gant.

1728
02:30:15,278 --> 02:30:17,211
你是那么想的，是吧？
That's what you think, isn't it?

1729
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,645
你以为是我和他之间的私事
It's somethin' personal between him and me.

1730
02:30:20,216 --> 02:30:22,012
卢，有可能是…
Well, Lou, it could be...

1731
02:30:22,689 --> 02:30:26,249
如果我和我的家人安定下来 等他来骚扰我们
...if I settle down with my family and wait for him to come.

1732
02:30:26,358 --> 02:30:29,190
他一定会出现的 如果我不现在阻止他的话
And he'll come, if I don't stop him here and now.

1733
02:30:30,163 --> 02:30:33,325
我要在葛兰特犯案时 人赃俱获逮住他
I'm gonna catch Gant red-handed, breakin' the law...

1734
02:30:33,701 --> 02:30:37,534
然后我要借助法律 让他永远不再得逞
...and then I'm gonna use the law to put him away once and for all.

1735
02:30:37,707 --> 02:30:39,071
法律，卢
The law, Lou.

1736
02:30:39,475 --> 02:30:41,271
我要借助法律
I'm gonna use the law...

1737
02:30:41,376 --> 02:30:44,367
但少了你的帮助 我成功的机率不大！
...but I haven't got much chance without your help.

1738
02:31:09,681 --> 02:31:11,409
守车厢里有多少人？
How many men in the caboose?

1739
02:31:11,483 --> 02:31:12,779
只有一个煞车手
Just one brakeman.

1740
02:31:13,084 --> 02:31:14,141
- 他有没有携带武器？ - 没有，从来没有
Is he armed?

1741
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:15,584
No, never has been.

1742
02:31:16,489 --> 02:31:18,422
我会在车厢里
I'll be in the express car.

1743
02:31:24,434 --> 02:31:25,491
谢谢你，卢
Thanks.

1744
02:31:25,802 --> 02:31:26,859
骑警？
Marshal!

1745
02:31:27,137 --> 02:31:28,865
前方有几名骑士
There's some riders up ahead.

1746
02:31:30,539 --> 02:31:31,835
我来看一下
I'll take a look.

1747
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:55,203
机师！前面有路障！
Engineer, there's a barricade ahead!

1748
02:31:55,271 --> 02:31:57,135
直接冲过去！
Open her up, wide open.

1749
02:32:23,259 --> 02:32:24,719
齐伯！

1750
02:32:24,876 --> 02:32:26,706
快点！快点！
Come on. Come on.

1751
02:32:47,839 --> 02:32:49,271
- 大家都上来了？ - 法兰奇的马跌下去了
Everybody make it?

1752
02:32:49,343 --> 02:32:50,604
- 我想他应该没上来 - 咱们开始行动吧
Frenchy's horse fell. I don't think he made it.

1753
02:32:50,677 --> 02:32:53,941
要拿到黄金还有一段路
Well, let's move. It's a long way from here to that gold.

1754
02:32:54,381 --> 02:32:56,371
没有危险，继续往前走
There's no danger. Just keep goin'.

1755
02:33:14,541 --> 02:33:15,768
是罗林
It's Rawlings!

1756
02:34:47,425 --> 02:34:48,789
火车往后退！
Back this train up!

1757
02:34:48,896 --> 02:34:49,884
快点！
And fast!

1758
02:37:11,505 --> 02:37:15,760
（旅馆）

1759
02:37:17,652 --> 02:37:19,551
我们为什么这么早就要离开，爸？
How come we're leavin' so early, Pa?

1760
02:37:19,587 --> 02:37:21,781
咱们路途遥远呢，儿子
We got a long way to go, son.

1761
02:37:22,322 --> 02:37:23,345
来
Here.

1762
02:37:27,631 --> 02:37:29,894
姨婆，我们什么时候去你家？
Auntie, when are we going to your house?

1763
02:37:29,933 --> 02:37:32,025
到你们家之后 你爸爸会再做决定
Your daddy will decide when we get to your home.

1764
02:37:32,069 --> 02:37:33,899
姨婆，可不可以带山姆一起去？
Honest? Can we take Sam with us?

1765
02:37:33,973 --> 02:37:36,099
我想是山姆带我们去吧
I think Sam is taking us.

1766
02:37:58,370 --> 02:38:01,065
爸，还有多远才到 莉莉丝姨婆的农场？
Pa, how much further is it to Aunt Lilith's ranch?

1767
02:38:01,107 --> 02:38:04,405
儿子，过下一个弯之后 再下一个弯…
Well, son, it's around the next bend, and the next bend...

1768
02:38:04,710 --> 02:38:06,233
就在山谷后面
...and the valley beyond.

1769
02:38:10,252 --> 02:38:11,809
- 莉莉丝姨婆，你知道那首歌？
Aunt Lilith, do you know that song?

1770
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:13,284
- 那是我们的歌
That's our song!

1771
02:38:13,956 --> 02:38:15,047
你们的歌？
Your song?

1772
02:38:15,625 --> 02:38:19,287
在你爸出生之前 我早已唱过那首歌了
I sang that song long before your pa was ever born.

1773
02:38:19,799 --> 02:38:23,859
【走，走，跟我走吧】
"Away, away, come away with me

1774
02:38:24,336 --> 02:38:26,826
【那荒野长着野草】
"Where the grass grows wild

1775
02:38:26,974 --> 02:38:29,066
【这风在自由的吹】
"Where the winds blow free

1776
02:38:29,277 --> 02:38:31,642
【走，走】- 齐伯
"Away, away--" Zeb!

1777
02:38:31,746 --> 02:38:33,906
【跟我走吧】
"Come away with me

1778
02:38:34,083 --> 02:38:38,712
【我会和你在荒草上安一个家】
"Where I'll build you a home In the meadow

1779
02:38:39,256 --> 02:38:43,282
【来吧，来吧，有一片神奇的土地】
"Come, come, there's a wondrous land

1780
02:38:43,394 --> 02:38:45,827
【为了充满希望的心】
"For the hopeful heart

1781
02:38:45,930 --> 02:38:48,329
【荒野乐意帮助】
"For the willing hand

1782
02:38:48,937 --> 02:38:52,929
【来吧，来吧 ，有一片神奇的土地】
"Come, come, there's a wondrous land

1783
02:38:53,207 --> 02:38:57,404
【我将在这里为你在草地上建一个家】
"And I'll build you a home in the meadow."

1784
02:39:06,791 --> 02:39:12,228
西部就是被这些已不在人世的 先锋者，拓荒者和冒险家赢来的
The West that was won by its pioneers, settlers, adventurers is long gone now.

1785
02:39:13,366 --> 02:39:15,094
但它却永远属于他们
Yet, it is theirs forever.

1786
02:39:16,070 --> 02:39:20,165
他们在历史上留下痕迹 从未被风雨侵袭消失…
For they left tracks in history that will never be eroded by wind or rain...

1787
02:39:20,843 --> 02:39:25,336
从未被耕耘机碾平过 从未被堆肥淹没过
...never plowed under by tractors, never buried in the compost of events.

1788
02:39:27,116 --> 02:39:30,881
从他们简单纯朴的生活方式 他们强韧的生命力…
Out of the hard simplicity of their lives, out of their vitality...

1789
02:39:30,991 --> 02:39:33,151
他们的希望与悲伤…
...their hopes and their sorrows...

1790
02:39:33,726 --> 02:39:35,750
衍生出勇气与荣耀的传奇…
...grew legends of courage and pride...

1791
02:39:35,828 --> 02:39:39,024
启发他们的孩子以及后辈子孙
...to inspire their children and their children's children.

1792
02:39:40,332 --> 02:39:42,731
从他们血汗孕育过的土地…
From soil enriched by their blood...

1793
02:39:42,904 --> 02:39:45,463
和他们探索与创造的热忱…
...out of their fever to explore and build...

1794
02:39:45,909 --> 02:39:49,139
曾经炙热的沙漠如今变成大湖…
...came lakes where once were burning deserts...

1795
02:39:49,378 --> 02:39:52,972
发展出丰硕的大地 矿产以及麦田…
...came the goods of the earth, mines and wheat fields...

1796
02:39:53,084 --> 02:39:55,244
果园和伟大的伐木园…
...orchards and great lumber mills...

1797
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:58,010
这一切便是打造这国家的力量
...all the sinews of a growing country.

1798
02:40:00,259 --> 02:40:04,092
从他们简陋的落脚之处，杂货店 演变成城市…
Out of their rude settlements, their trading posts, came cities...

1799
02:40:04,298 --> 02:40:07,061
甚至成为全世界顶尖的大城市
...to rank among the great ones of the world.

1800
02:40:07,435 --> 02:40:10,062
这一切传承让人们享有梦想的自由…
All the heritage of a people free to dream...

1801
02:40:10,838 --> 02:40:12,099
行动的自由 
...free to act...

1802
02:40:12,343 --> 02:40:14,435
让人们能自由自在开创自己的命运
...free to mold their own destiny.

1803
02:40:16,532 --> 02:40:19,501
乐土，乐土
"The promised land, promised land

1804
02:40:19,668 --> 02:40:24,401
乐土是鱼米之乡，有丰富的黄金
"Promised land The land of plenty, rich with gold

1805
02:40:24,506 --> 02:40:29,000
这里是梦想家用拳头和枪书写的
"Here came dreamers With Bible, fist and gun

1806
02:40:29,478 --> 02:40:34,347
他们的马车穿过平原的土地
"Bound for land Across the plains their wagons rode

1807
02:40:34,416 --> 02:40:36,475
抽打着皮鞭飞驰
"Hell bent for leather

1808
02:40:36,552 --> 02:40:41,012
这就是赢得西部的方式
"That's how the West was won

1809
02:40:41,723 --> 02:40:46,524
他们肩并肩驯服野蛮的大草原
"Side by side They tamed the savage prairie land

1810
02:40:46,595 --> 02:40:51,225
没有什么能阻止他们，没有风，没有雨，也没有太阳
"Nothing stopped them Nor wind, nor rain, nor sun

1811
02:40:51,466 --> 02:40:56,403
每一块土地的每一个先锋
"Side by side Each pioneer from every land

1812
02:40:56,538 --> 02:40:58,506
所有的土地都拉扯在一起
"All pulled together

1813
02:40:58,674 --> 02:41:03,043
这就是赢得西部的方式
"That's how the West was won

1814
02:41:03,378 --> 02:41:08,145
他们歌唱的时候将放下他们的脚步
"And they sang of the day When they would rest their boots

1815
02:41:08,317 --> 02:41:12,686
在这片水域流动的土地上
"In a land where the still waters flowed

1816
02:41:13,255 --> 02:41:17,851
有人有与妻子落地生根的梦想
"There were dreams of man and wife Who'd put down roots

1817
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:22,062
他们的爱和爱的种子会在这成长
"And their love and the seeds of love Would grow

1818
02:41:32,182 --> 02:41:38,689
剧终

1819
02:42:03,547 --> 02:42:06,550
（退场）
