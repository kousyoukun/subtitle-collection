to the heights of Internet fame,

45
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,533
through outrageous rainbow hair,
facial tattoos,

46
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,245
and flaunting affiliation
with a New York street gang.

47
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,872
He started beef with rappers
across the country

48
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:48,585
and celebrated violent acts against them
on his Instagram account.

49
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,589
Tekashi 6ix9ine created a digital persona
that no one could ignore

50
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,051

famous people in the world.

51
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,763
Is he for real, though,
or just a master manipulator?

52
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,432
When I realized he lived near me
in Brooklyn,

53
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,186
I messaged his manager Shotti
about making a documentary.

57
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,406
facing 47 years to life in federal prison.

58
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,326
After his arrest, he immediately
snitched against his own crew,

59
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,204
members of the Nine Trey Bloods gang,

60
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,791

SHADOW THE GREAT:
Bushwick right now, it's changing.

83
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,061
Like I'm walking on blocks
that's totally renovated

84
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,605
and those buildings
used to be crack spots

85
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,816
and now like they're duplexes and shit.

86
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,234
Like it's... it's crazy.

87
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:23,115
I'd say five years ago,
less money, more poverty.

88
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,659
Less jobs.

89
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,704
And now it look like
the neighborhood is booming.

90
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,875
More bars, more clubs, more apartments.

91
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,001
Artists everywhere.

92
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,128
Studios is popping up
in every block now.

93
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,254
It wasn't like that before.

94
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,882
We used to have to go
all the way to the city.

95
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,050
Like this is really like
an extension of the city now.

96
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:51,518
I would say 2011, I met Danny
on Myrtle and Broadway on his block

97
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,686
in Bushwick.

98
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,979
Tough block.

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,858
Danny was a cool kid.

100
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,610
He was a youngin, you know.
He just needed guidance.

101
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,195
He needed direction.

102
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,114
He wasn't like a delinquent or nothing.
He wasn't no jailbird.

103
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,492
He was a cool young Hispanic kid

104
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,704
from the ghettos of Bushwick, Brooklyn.

105
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,749
VIKRAM: Was poverty
a huge driving force for him?

106
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,292
SHADOW: For all of us.

107
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,420
That's why he goes so hard
'cause nobody wanna be hungry again.

108
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,216
Nobody want they daughter starving.
Nobody want they mom starving.

109
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,427
Yeah, he's from it.
He's definitely from it.

110
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,017
DANIEL:
Bushwick, borderline Bed‐Stuy.

111
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,936
Right on Myrtle Avenue.

112
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,896
Right on Locust.

113
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,189
That's my hood.

114
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,151
I feel like,
when people meet famous people,

115
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,446
they can't make that connection
that we are you guys,

116
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,282
but before all of this,
we come from some place, right?

117
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,868
This is where I came from
before all of this fame.

118
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:54,081
I have two family members, like, ever.

119
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,334
My mama came here from Mexico by herself.

120
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,212
She had my brother in '94.

121
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,172
Had me in '96.

122
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,508
My biological dad left.

123
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,301
Us three trooped it out.

124
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,765
SARA MOLINA: My upbringing
was totally different compared to his.

125
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,352
As a child, like, we didn't live rich,
but we weren't poor,

126
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:19,314
and I never had to like want
or need for anything growing up.

127
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,401
It made me kind of feel pity for him.

128
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,279
DANIEL:
Just a fucking regular kid in Brooklyn.

129
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,448
This was actually my home,
where me and my mom,

130
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,534
my brother and his girlfriend,

131
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,412
my girlfriend, my daughter lived.

132
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,082
I actually slept on this bed
with my mom, um...

133
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,959
till a fucking late‐ass age.

134
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,213
This was the first computer I bought
to learn how to edit videos myself.

135
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,049
Like this was, like,
I spent my last couple of dollars

136
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,634
buying this shit.

137
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,386
SARA:
Railroad apartment...

138
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,056
I hated living there the first few months.

139
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,725
I hated it so much.

140
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,477
It was nothing like what I was used to.

141
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,105
His mom was a really bad hoarder, so...

142
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,817
wherever there was a little bit of space,
it wasn't there for long.

143
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,486
Made me wanna pull my hair out.

144
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,824
We had some mutual friends.

145
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,036
I went to high school
with some people that he knew

146
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,495
and he was friends with,

147
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,542
so he saw that and he ended up
reaching out to me through Facebook.

148
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,669
And from that day,

149
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,713
we spoke every day after that.

150
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,883
VIKRAM:
Is he your first boyfriend?

151
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,134
‐ Yeah.

152
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,889
I was in love, I was young.

153
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,517
I thought he was so funny.

154
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,685
I thought he was so charismatic.

155
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,482
Even now, as much as people‐‐
he gets under people's skin,

156
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,527
there's still something that all people
take to him that they like.

157
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,531
LAWYER: Did you work?
DANIEL: Yes.

158
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,740
LAWYER:
What did you do?

159
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,494
DANIEL: I started working at the...
I wanna say the age of 13.

160
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,747
I got a job at a grocery store
named Stay Fresh Grill,

161
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,083
where I worked as the delivery boy.

162
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,335
I worked up to register.

163
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,296
Shortly after that, became a rapper.

164
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,636
‐ I moved to New York in 2011,

165
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,929
from Chicago.

166
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,932
And I landed in Locust Street.

167
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:21,186
And I was really into street art
and graffiti at that time.

168
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,272
I think I was the only

169
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:27,943
"nonoriginal resident"
on the, on the, the block.

170
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,571
And, you know,

Always at the same
24‐hours bodega, Stay Fresh.

174
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,205
And Danny was there
behind the counter.

175
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,168
You know, there's a weird thing
about bodegas

176
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,961
and at certain ones.

177
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,046
Like, the counter's always raised a bit,

178
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,175
so you're kind of holding court
over the entire store,

179

or convenience mart, you know.

180
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,261
So that's what he did, you know?

181
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,972
You walked in and he'd be
yelling at this person,

182
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,682
smiling and talking, you know.

Recognize you, "What's up, Adam?"

It's just this little bizarre
environment of energy.

At that time, it was the meeting place.

So, Loaf Muzik started around 2009.

194
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,777
It was a collective.

195
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:56,782
We had break‐dancers, graffiti writers,
producers, DJs, and MCs.

196
00:10:56,782 --> 00:11:00,118
It started with the MCs
and then it became a home

197
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:04,373
for other young kids
in Brooklyn, Bushwick, to create.

198
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,459
Loaf was a opportunity
for him to express himself

199
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:11,547
and escape the realities of what
he was going through on his side,

was the father figure.

And Danny, it was his home
and he fit into that.

Never went to a party,
never went to a show.

206

We introduced him
to our own collective

207
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:33,151
and gave him a home
where he can be himself and create.

208
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,903
And that's when he started
creating clothing.

He asked me to shoot the video.

00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:22,644
I went to his house.

339
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,563
They just had a whole bunch
of props and shit,

00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,482
like a whole bunch of like keys

and at least he's not, uh,
on the streets or whatever like.

345
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,583
He's trying to create this crazy
shock‐value content,

346
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,753
so people can look at it and be like,
"Oh, what the fuck is this?"

347
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,964
VIKRAM:
These early videos were getting retweets

348
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,383
and finding a small fan base.

349
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,053
He started getting noticed
by hip‐hop blogs.

350
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:00,849
But the Internet is crowded
and a difficult place to stand out.

351
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,188
DANIEL: One day I woke up and I said,
"Yo, I'm a loud person on the mike,

352
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,650
and when I walk in a room,
I already have a loud presence."

353
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,736
And I say,
"Yo, I want my look to be loud."

DAVID: He first came into my shop
to ask for a 6ix9ine tattoo.

355
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:21,537
It's always been policy here
that anybody coming of that age

356
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:25,290
cannot get a tattoo on their hand
or on their face

357
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,835
that would affect their future.

358
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,838
He simply said,

359
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:34,258
"I am going to do this.
You don't understand.

360
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,593
"I am going to be a rapper.

361
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:41,014
No matter which way you look at it,
I am 6ix9ine."

362
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:49,982
It's a never‐ending cycle of generation
after generation after generation

363
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,734
after generation
of going through this poverty

364
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:56,071
and going through this crap
and having to endure all this shit.

365
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,906
So that's what was in his mind.

366
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,159
He was determined
to break that poverty cycle.

367
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,038
No matter what, we're not
gonna be fuckin' poor no more.

368
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,130
VIKRAM: Do you remember
when he first got his hair dyed?

369
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,840
Were you with him?

370
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,177
SARA:
Yeah, I'm the one that found the salon.

371
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:22,097
Where we're from,
not many of the salons around the way

372
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,392
do those type of colors, so I'm just...

373
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,896
I was like,
"We'll have to go to Williamsburg."

374
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:32,774
And I called, I made the appointment,
and we walked in there,

375
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,027
and they was like,
"So, what are you getting done?"

376
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:38,530
And I was like,
"Oh, it's not for me, it's for him."

REBECCA FAYE:
This is just from, you know, a while ago.

378
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,960
He let me do a little
cool promotion for my shop...

379
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:56,215
uh, so that if people wanted to get
their hair colored where he does,

380
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,300
they would win a chance to meet him.

381
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:04,598
The first time,
he wanted like a light mint green

382
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,017
to a fade of light purple.

383
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,520
I just thought, like, "Who's this kid?

384
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,730
You know, it's great. Let's do it."

385
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,067
VIKRAM: What did he say to you
his reason was?

386
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,861
REBECCA: He said he was a rapper
and that he was gonna be

387
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,031
a really famous rapper one day,
and, you know, I teased him

388
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,783
because he had the little 69s,
and I was like,

389
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,493
"Well, you gotta
do something with it

390
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,204
'cause it'll be hard for you
to find a normal job."

391
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,749
He needed his look, you know,
to be different.

392
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:39,800
I feel like, since Danny
did his hair rainbow,

393
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,597
the whole world, the whole like Internet,
became a craze of rainbow.

actually seen an effect because of him?

‐ Oh, 100%.

REBECCA:
He's a trendsetter.

399
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,664
VIKRAM: One of the ways
to get noticed in hip‐hop

400
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:14,001
is to be co‐signed
by other more successful artists.

401
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:18,005
It gives you street cred
and potential for gaining clout

6ix9ine came to Spanish Harlem.

I was going to a bar called the Duck,
right here down the block.

411

Young kid, you know what I'm saying?

you know what I'm sayin',

417
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,510
that was good for his résumé.
"Oh, you with this dude.

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,136
"Oh, you with Bodega Bamz.
That's what's up.

If you don't wanna get used,
get the fuck out.

424
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:21,693
What I saw from him from the gate was
he would do whatever to be famous.

425
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,071
To the point where that's why I didn't
wanna do a record with him,

426

'cause I thought that was dangerous.

427
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,283
And I ain't like his message,
because when I first met him,

428
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:33,288
he had shirts that said "HIV, AIDS,"
you know, that weirdo shit.

shock value, shock value.

00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:38,418
This is before he had any face tattoos.

431
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,672
Case in point why he colored his hair.
The shock value, he was into that.

432
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:45,175
The shit he was doin' was mad weird,
but his talent was...

433
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,885

The shock value was hood.

437

You gotta watch the video, but...
the song was called, um, "Shinigami."

438

what the fuck that means.

00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:24,168
and 2 Live Crew's videos verged on porn.

493
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:29,214
Danny combined sex, crime,
drug use, expensive cars,

494
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,718
and all the images
that teenagers are addicted to,

495
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:36,930
to build his 6ix9ine persona
and break through on the Internet.

496
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:40,392
But one night,
his antics crossed the line.

497
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,021
‐ I don't want no kids to be in my shoes.

498
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:46,607
Yo, I was literally
just trying to figure out

499
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,692
how can I make it in this rap game?

500
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:52,487
That night, I was literally
shooting a music video

501
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,990
in a fuckin' traphouse in Harlem.

502
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,618

00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,913
It's just some guys I met randomly.

505
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:05,167
VIKRAM: That night during the shoot,
a girl was invited up.

506
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:09,046
Some of the men there had sex
with her, and it was filmed.

507
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,132
Danny shared these videos on social media.

508
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,637
She was only 13 years old.

509
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:19,389
SARA:
It made me feel disgusted.

510
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,184
You know, even if you thought
she was older,

511
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:27,147
in what way does it feel okay
to violate a woman like that?

512
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:31,485
Let alone to come to find out
it was a younger girl.

513
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,779
So it's just like, he got locked up.

514
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,532
I'm hearing what he's
getting locked up from.

515
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:39,159
I'm pregnant, nobody knows.

516
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,744
I'm stressed.

517
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,163

She was 13.

No, she was 13...

Yeah, I think she was 13.
WOMAN: And you were?

520

‐ And I was 17.

521
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:51,421
I turned 18 that, that, that, um...

522
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:55,509
Remember, I went to jail March 3rd
and lasted all the way to May.

523
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,469
I turned 18 that‐‐ that year.

VIKRAM:
Danny was actually 18 years old.

525
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:04,560
He pled guilty on one charge
and signed a plea deal.

526
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,604
He was out and free in a couple months

527
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:11,149
and would be on probation
for the next two years.

528

We do not respect that.

That's not what Scum Gang 69 is about.

532
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,670
BODEGA: When he got locked up,
he went to Rikers Island.

533
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,463
But we were still in communication.

534
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,550
So when he got released from the jail,

535
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,261
his hair was off now
'cause he had to cut his hair.

536
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,097

Back on the streets,

Danny could no longer post
sexually explicit content.

540
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:57,362

$100,000 for Danny's bail

like an angel and a demon.

The closest I can think of
that was 6ix9ine was maybe Axl Rose.

I remember a point early on, uh...

574
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,911
where I was like, "All right, Danny,
you know, I recorded it.

575
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:13,165
I mixed it here, but don't you want
to get it to a professional to master?"

"Why? I like the way you do it."

577

00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,541
Well, the 6ix9ine story has been my life

657
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:15,337
basically consistently since, you know,
the summer of 2018.

658

My God.

659
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:19,299
Uh, I am an associate editor
at Complex.

660
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:22,469
And, you know, I was
a staff writer there in 2018.

661
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,972
We were trying to figure out
how to cover this, you know,

662
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:26,974
SoundCloud rap wave.

663
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,102
And so many of the artists,

664
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,772
uh, including Tekashi,
had, to put it mildly,

665
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:35,983
objectionable things
in their personal lives.

667

VIKRAM: One of those SoundCloud rappers
was Trippie Redd,

668
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:50,247
a 17‐year‐old kid from Ohio
with face tattoos, gang‐affiliation,

669

and a record contract.

670
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,962
He was signed to a label called
Strange Music, owned by Elliot Grainge.

671
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,756
Elliot is the son of Sir Lucian Grainge.

SHAWN SETARO:
Elliot Grainge is the son

673
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:06,680
of arguably the most powerful man
in the music business.

674
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,266
Yeah, I think it's safe to say
that Tekashi was aware

675
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,310
who Elliot's father was.

It's been a long time coming,

of buzz going on right now, and, uh...

I'm not sure exactly how it happened,

695
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,752
but you definitely have
a fuckin' defined aesthetic.

696
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,296
Like there's something
very, very new going on with you.

00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:28,178

to know me and shit.

700
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:30,013
ADAM22:
The 6ix9ine's first interview,

701
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:32,391
I met him when he had
like 20,000 followers,

702
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:34,476
I did the interview with him
and he had 60,000

703
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,353
and I posted a photo with him
and then I went

704
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,814
and looked the next day
and he had 70,000.

705
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:42,401
And that was very odd to me.
I hadn't even put the interview out yet.

706
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:45,195
But just from a photo,
just from people looking at him,

707
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:48,031
he got 10,000 followers in a day.

708
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,075
I just remember that really
standing out to me.

709
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,703
I was like, "People are really
gravitating towards this dude

710
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:53,871
one way or another."

711
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:56,164
When did this 6ix9ine thing
become a thing, though?

712
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:59,168
'Cause you have it tattooed
on your body probably, what,
like a couple dozen times?

713
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,253
‐ Nah, it's over like 200 times.

714
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:03,338
‐ Two hundred, Jesus.
‐ Over, over, over 200.

715
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,756
‐ Oh, my God, okay.

716
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,800
The most noticeable one's
the one on your face.

717
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,759
DANIEL: Yeah.
ADAM22: Easily.

718
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,844
And that's new, right?

719
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,888
DANIEL: Yeah, it's new.
ADAM22: It's still peeling a little bit.

720
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,890
DANIEL: Yeah, it's peeling.
ADAM22: That's brand‐new.

721
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,560
And then when he got
a fucking face tattoo, you know,

722
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,230
like I feel like the face tattoo
for a lot of these artists is like,

723
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,233
"Either it's gonna happen
or I'm gonna die trying,"

724
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:28,197
because like what else can you really do
with a giant 69 tattooed on your face?

725
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:31,700
SARA: He was getting these tattoos
behind my back.

726
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,078
I was finding out about the tattoos
the same way everybody else was.

727
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,747
Over Instagram.

728
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:40,459
VIKRAM:
In July of 2017, Danny posted photos

729
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:43,587
of his new forehead tattoo on Instagram.

730
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:47,591
His new look embodied
the SoundCloud aesthetic so well

731
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:49,801
that a new meme was born.

732
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:53,347
The Internet didn't care
that Tekashi 6ix9ine

733
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,390
wasn't even on SoundCloud.

734
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,726
ADAM22: I mean, there's something
kind of nice about becoming a meme,

735
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,770
where it's like there's so many people
talking shit about it

736
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,397
and they don't really know anything
about you and you're just kind of like,

737
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:05,776
all right, I guess this is
what it's like to be popular
or famous or something,

738
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:07,110
is that you're a meme now.

739
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,613
‐ I feel like if nobody talk about you,
you're just boring.

740
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,615
You know what I mean?
So, like...

741
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:15,244
I don't feel no type of way about
the negative feedback that I get.

742
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:18,622
Like, if you're gonna waste your time
and really be talking about me,

743
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:19,873
you're actually making me litter.

744
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:23,168
VIKRAM:
One meme quickly turned into many.

745
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:26,588
His nameless image went viral
all over the Internet.

746
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:30,342
Including this picture
taken by his collaborator

747
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:32,427
and former friend, Philly Mula.

748
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:35,097
PHILLY MULA: After that,
I remember everything shot up.

749
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:38,016
Fuckin' you could say "Poles1469,"
what's that, a couple million,

750
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:39,852
five, six million,
you know what I'm sayin'?

751
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,979
That gave them both shine,
though, you know?

752
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:44,648
And then boom, next thing you know

753
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:48,485
he's fucking top don in New York,
you know what I'm saying?

754
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:49,778
That's crazy.

755
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:52,114
VIKRAM: It sounds like you got
a little skepticism

756
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:56,076
or cynicism around, like,
what it means to be famous

757
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,619
and how to make it.

758
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,746
PHILLY:
Basically, what matters the most

759
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:03,375
is gonna be your image,
you know what I'm sayin'?

760
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:06,170
With him, what made him
stood out like a sore thumb

761
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,297
was his hair and the tattoos.

762
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:11,300
But that's, you see, that's probably
what it will take me to get famous.

763
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,011
Matter of fact, I'm gonna get
a fucking packet of sazón

764
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,762
tattooed on my face after this interview.

765
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:19,099
If I don't make it on World Star, I don't
give a fuck, I'm gonna kill myself.

766
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,310

just get hot sauces on your face?

767
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,686
PHILLY:
Fuckin' hell, yeah.

768
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,355
Do stupid shit.
That's what it's gonna take now.

769
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,822
SHAWN:
Right as "Poles1469,"

770
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:37,534
his collaboration with Trippie Redd,
starts to blow up,

771
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:42,748
Zilla uses this 2015 incident
against Tekashi.

772
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:47,085
And I should say it's really horrible
to use this girl as a pawn

773
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:49,379
in a rap beef.

774
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,839
But that's what they did.

775
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,634
Right after this happens,

776
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:56,929
Trippie decides to distance himself
from 6ix9ine.

777
00:43:58,388 --> 00:43:59,515
‐ I'm sorry, brozzie.

778
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:02,392
1400 don't promote pedophiles.

779
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:06,188
We don't, we don't fuck
with, uh, weird niggas.

780
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:09,650
Niggas, niggas is on
some whole different shit now.

781
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:13,654
VIKRAM: After being labeled a pedophile
and losing all his allies...

782
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:14,947
‐ ...it was an accident.

783
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,865
VIKRAM:
Danny needed to change the narrative.

784
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:20,118
So he doubled down
on his gangster persona.

785

BILLY ADO:
Seeing how everything played out

786
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:25,916
and watching the stuff with Trippie Redd

787
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,377
and the case with the girl from the back
and then learning all this stuff,

788
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:29,586
I'm looking at it like...

789
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,424
damn, he needed fuckin' help.

790
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:35,843
He needed help bad.

791
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,930
His name, his reputation, his career
was just going down the drain.

792
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:42,432
Trippie Redd's Blood.

793
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,101
He's real.

794
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,563
Here come Seqo with some
real fuckin' bunch of Bloods

795
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,148
and these guys are really like that
and you're like, "Oh, shit.

796
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:51,859
This might be it right here."

797
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:54,695
SEQO BILLY:
I got a call and my manager's like,

798
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,280
"Yo, you wanna come meet this kid?"

799
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,366
I pull up, he played his stuff.
I liked the videos.

800
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:02,703
And that's how he was
presented to us, through videos.

801
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:05,414
He told us hisself his music was trash.

802
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:07,541
"My music is trash, my video fire."

803
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,961
VIKRAM: [laughing] What did you
think about when you heard that?

804
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:12,337
‐ I thought it was genius.

805
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:16,425
‐ His music before was like
some rock‐and‐roll stuff.

806
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:17,676
‐ Yeah.
‐ And then when he,

807
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,678
you know, came around us, I guess,

808
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:22,347
you know, the gangster stuff
started coming out.

809
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:25,809
VIKRAM: Why do you, why do you think
he was drawn to that at all? Like...

810
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:29,646
‐ 'Cause he probably felt that's the way
that people wanted to see.

811
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:31,398
SEQO:
Everything is just for the entertainment.

812
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:34,067
So you see that,
the image is for the entertainment.

813
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:35,777
VIKRAM: Yeah.
‐ It's to have you going,

814
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:38,113
"Oh, ah," or "wow."

815
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:39,531

01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,616
Shotti realized there was a way
to cash in on the Treyway name.

1138
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:03,247
‐ Um, Treyway is the new Death Row,

1139
01:01:03,247 --> 01:01:05,332
'cause we comin' to the game
with a ferocity.

1140
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:08,544
We are the new bad boy because
we comin' to the game with all the hits.

1141
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:11,088
I'm the hottest CEO in the game,
you dig what I'm sayin'?

1142
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:12,673
DJ PVNCH:
I matter. That's why you talk to me.

1143
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:14,883
SHOTTI: Yeah, that's a fact. I can't‐‐
Nobody can't manage 6ix9ine.

1144
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:17,469
He can't... it just won't happen,
you dig it?

1145
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:20,472
He's like a, um, a wild animal.
You just gotta let him be, he rolls free.

1146
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:21,515
Dig what I'm saying?

1147
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:24,768
CHANELLE: He just thought he was
the damn boss, that's all he wanted to be.

1148
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:27,938
He wasn't the CEO of Treyway.
He knew... he knew that.

1149
01:01:27,938 --> 01:01:31,525
So, I guess he was trying to,
you know, start a little trouble,

1150
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:33,694
or try to make, you know, two Treyways.

1151
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,404
[laughing]

1152
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:36,864
VIKRAM:
Like many times in Danny's story,

1153
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,783
a rift started to form
in the Treyway crew.

1154
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:43,328
Chanelle, Seqo Billy, Billy Ado , and Harv

1155
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:46,039
were slowly being pushed out by Shotti.

1156
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,543
‐ Shotti probably had his own agenda
that nobody knew of.

1157
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,879
That's that sneaky stuff
when you're around people

1158
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:53,297
and they snaking you.

1159
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:55,299
We didn't know.

1160
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,930
That's what you get
when you don't stray the right way.

1161
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:05,893
You came over here through Seqo,
you supposed to stick with Seqo.

1162
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,186
That's it.

1163
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:09,521
VIKRAM: Like, what do you see
as like the two different directions?

1164
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:11,190
What could have happened
if you imagined‐‐

1165
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:14,067
CHANELLE: One is the straight path,
the good path, and one is the bad path.

1166
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:16,904
He like did the bad path,
the negative path.

1167
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:19,031
Shotti's the dark side.

1168
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:29,750
SHAWN: Tekashi loses the man
he considers his father

1169
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,168
when he's 13 years old.

1170
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:36,840
Tekashi's biological father
is out of his life very early on.

1171
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:41,678
I think Tekashi was searching
for father figures

1172
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:43,847
and Shotti definitely played that role.

1173
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:48,393
VIKRAM: The dark side
complemented Danny's persona,

1174
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:51,605
and Shotti let Tekashi 6ix9ine loose.

1175
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:54,441
CHANELLE: A troll is somebody
who wants attention.

1176
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:57,236
They don't care how they get
the attention as long as they get it.

1177
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:59,279
Good, bad, negative.

1178
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:01,740
Hurtin' people. They just want it.

1179
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,283
He was unstoppable.

1180
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:05,619
He liked to troll.
He was the troll king.

1181
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:07,579
‐ You know how many people
I told to suck my dick in this industry?

1182
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:09,248
Everybody suck my fuckin' dick.

1183
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:10,707
Suck my fuckin' dick.

1184
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:12,084
Suck
my fuckin' dick.

1185
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,836
Suck my fuckin' dick.

1186
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:15,796
Suck my dick, suck my dick,
suck my dick.

1187
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:18,465
Suck my dick with your mother's lips.
Have your mother suck my dick.

1188
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:20,926
Yo, I done told the whole world
to suck my dick.

1189
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:22,511
I tell niggas suck my dick every day.

1190
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:25,472
‐ You tell somebody
to suck your dick, man,
you gotta be ready to either kill or die.

1191
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,474
‐ Aight, and I'm ready to die
and I'm ready to kill.

1192
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:29,643
‐ Jesus Christ.
SARA: He's always been a troll.

1193
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:32,187
Always. Before the persona.

1194
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:35,482
Even when he was just Danny,
Danny was gonna troll you.

1195
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:37,317
DJ PVNCH:
He just knew how to tug on emotions.

1196
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:40,070
He knew how to get people mad,
whether it was a lie or the truth.

1197
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,781
He had no limits on what he would do.

1198
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,617
It was all about the pursuit of clout.

1199
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:48,245
VIKRAM: Clout on the Internet
translated into rock star money.

1200
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:52,207
Danny started flaunting jewelry
and stacks of cash online.

1201
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:55,836
Now with the support of the gang,
Danny's trolling intensified

1202
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:58,213
and he started targeting
mainstream rappers.

1203
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:04,136
‐ Luda, you bum ass, pussy ass,
"Fast and the Furious" geek.

1204
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:07,764
‐ [indistinct]
Well, nigga, fuck 6ix9ine, nigga.

1205
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:09,766
I want Bloods!
What's happening, Blood?

1206
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:13,812
‐ Hey, Blood. Man, fuck 6ix9ine, Blood.

1207
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:17,566
In real life, these rappers
are fuckin' pussies.

1208
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,359
‐ You don't think
you're effing up your money

1209
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,153
with this tough guy gangster persona?

1210
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:22,946
‐ Nah...
What, you think it's a persona?

1211
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:24,698
‐ It is clearly a persona.

1212
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:36,293
VIKRAM: So, what was Danny like
when he wasn't being 6ix9ine?

1213
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,546
‐ A lot more timid.

1214
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:42,966
Drastically, drastically, drastically
less aggressive.

1215
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,218
Uh, way more playful.

1216
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:46,845
He still was playful, even though
when he was on, on, on,

1217
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:48,722
when cameras was off, he still like...

1218
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,849
he still was on his kid shit, you know.

1219
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:52,476
Slap you and run.

1220
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:58,482
VIKRAM: And what is the difference
between Daniel and Tekashi?

1221
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,901
‐ They were two separate people
at the beginning,

1222
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:02,611
but that, that morphed into one.

1223
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:06,448
'Cause, yeah, 'cause over time, it's like,

1224
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,617
what's the point
of switching back to normal?

1225
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:15,249
SARA: It was becoming hard for him
to really differentiate,

1226
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:19,127
like, this persona and his real life.

1227
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:22,965
There was no difference between
Danny and Tekashi anymore.

1228
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:34,309
‐ You see the Mexican, Jorge?

1229
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:36,395
ANGIE MARTINEZ: That's your security.
‐ That's my everyday guy.

1230
01:05:36,395 --> 01:05:38,146
And when you look at him,

1231
01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:40,774
you're like,
"That's not Tekashi's entourage."

1232
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,901
ANGIE: You must like him 'cause...
DANIEL: And I love him.

1233
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:45,863
He literally is like
another father to my daughter.

1234
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:46,989
He's everything. Like he's...

1235
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,866
ANGIE: So, did he make you
come here today?

1236
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:51,076
DANIEL: He literally woke me up,
and just like, "Yo, come on,

1237
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:53,036
you've got an interview,
it starts at 12:00, it's 11:30."

1238
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,948
VIKRAM: With Shotti by his side
and Jorge behind the wheel,

1239
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:32,784
6ix9ine and members
of the Nine Trey Bloods

1240
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:36,413
started committing
premeditated robberies and assaults

1241
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:39,917
to settle the beef that he'd started
on social media.

1242
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:42,336
6ix9ine had become a full‐on gangster.

1243
01:06:43,962 --> 01:06:46,256
And that's when the guns
started coming out.

1244
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:52,346
In April 2018, after being insulted
by members of Rap‐A‐Lot Records,

1245
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:55,098
the gang rushed
to Midtown Manhattan to retaliate.

1246
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:53,073
VIKRAM: They ended up robbing
at gunpoint ScumLord Dizzy,

1247
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:55,826
a rapper completely unrelated to the beef,

1248
01:07:55,826 --> 01:07:58,203
who just happened to be exiting the lobby.

1249
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:01,623
They stole his gold chain
and his backpack.

1250
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,148
VIKRAM: You were there also
at the Barclays, right?

1251
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:57,888
[indistinct rap over loudspeaker]

1252
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:18,075
‐ [gunshot]
‐ [screaming]

1253
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:29,962
VIKRAM:
Who's controlling the situation?

1254
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:33,090
Is Danny controlling it, or Shotti?
Who's making it happen?

1255
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:41,431
‐ Niggas started running and shit.

1256
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,315
[indistinct chatter]

1257
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:52,526
‐ Nigga say, fuck boy don't run.

1258
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:55,612
VIKRAM: And then afterwards,
Danny goes on the Internet.

1259
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:56,905
He's laughing about it.

1260
01:10:02,703 --> 01:10:06,582
‐ Ever'body?
‐ Ever'body gettin' shot. Boom‐boom‐boom!

1261
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,333
[siren wailing]

1262
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:11,503
VIKRAM: So, at this point,
you have got in pretty deep.

1263
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:43,535
‐ So, fuck Chief Keef, fuck Lil Reese,
fuck all them niggas.

1264
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:46,038
Fuck is y’all niggas talking about, nigga?
This is fuckin' Treyway, nigga.

1265
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:47,039
‐ Treyway!
‐ I betcha...

1266
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,958
SARA:
One of the times that I realized

1267
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:53,795
his trolling could be like
actually really real

1268
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:57,841
was when he was trolling
with Chief Keef.

1269
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:02,054
And he had put out a hit
on Chief Keef's head.

1270
01:11:02,054 --> 01:11:04,806
‐ Yeah, I got, I got, I got a 30‐pack
on him right now, Blood.

1271
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:05,974
30‐pack.

1272
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:08,477
SARA:
That surfaced and it went viral,

1273
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:13,315
and the next day Chief Keef
flew out to New York

1274
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:14,691
and he was in Brooklyn.

1275
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:18,278
I started seeing like the outcome

1276
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:20,781
of his trolling going too far.

1277
01:11:21,406 --> 01:11:23,867
REPORTER: Chicago rapper Chief Keef
is doing fine tonight

1278
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:25,869
after being shot at in New York.

1279
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:28,497
ADAM22: You send your friend
to go shoot at Chief Keef

1280
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,541
in the middle of Midtown Manhattan.

1281
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:33,794
You're crazy. That's not something that
anybody in their right mind would ever do.

1282
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:35,754
In a big way, you know,
those are the things

1283
01:11:35,754 --> 01:11:37,798
that sort of made people
want to pay attention to him,

1284
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:39,716
is that it seemed like he was

1285
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:43,929
doing something that should put
his life at risk, on a weekly basis.

1286
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:47,349
‐ I mean, I guess he has
a lot of beef on these streets.

1287
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:50,018
I don't know who's he's beefing with
that wants to hurt him,

1288
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:52,229
but it's definitely not me,
I'm actually a fan.

1289
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:56,316
SHAWN: He knew that doing
the unthinkable would...

1290
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:59,069
get him attention and make him a star.

1291
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:02,114
And he was absolutely right.

1292
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:05,701
‐ But this year we got three songs
on the Billboard Top 100.

1293
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:07,828
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:21:57,501 --> 01:21:58,877
he don't want him around.

1458
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:01,505
He thinks he's bad for business

1459
01:22:01,505 --> 01:22:04,842
and that he shouldn't be around Danny.

1460
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:09,388
SHAWN: The backstory to that is that,
Shotti was in the position

1461
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:14,017
of already fielding a ton of offers
from record labels for 6ix9ine,

1462
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:16,186
with a healthy cut for himself,

1463
01:22:16,186 --> 01:22:17,604
but he couldn't take them

1464
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:20,315
because 6ix9ine was signed
to Elliot Grainge.

1465
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:23,652
And Shotti doesn't like that very much.

1466
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:26,405
REPORTER: All right, let's bring you right
up to date here with some breaking news.

1467
01:22:26,405 --> 01:22:28,782
Police responding right now
to a shooting in Midtown.

1468
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:30,284
REPORTER 2:
...near busy Madison Avenue,

1469
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:32,661
and tonight we're learning
it is connected

1470
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,329
to a controversial rapper.

1471
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:36,290
REPORTER 3: Hernandez
was due to meet his manager

1472
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,876
here at the Upper East Side
restaurant Philippe to celebrate

1473
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:41,962
but brought a bunch of friends,
whom the manager had not invited.

1474
01:22:41,962 --> 01:22:45,716
REPORTER 4: One of them uses a chair
to hit one of the private security guys,

1475
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:47,134
a retired cop.

1476
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:51,638
OFFICER: This security guard
produced a licensed handgun

1477
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:55,267
and fired two times, striking
one of the individuals in the torso.

1478
01:22:55,267 --> 01:22:57,227
SHAWN:
So this is a key moment,

1479
01:22:57,227 --> 01:23:00,314
because Tekashi is really on his way

1480
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:04,151
to becoming an actual
honest‐to‐goodness star,

1481
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:06,069
who, you know, your grandma knows.

1482
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:09,615
And here comes Shotti and his friends,
these gangsters, you know,

1483
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:12,951
forcing their way in by throwing
a chair at the window.

1484
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:18,540
And it's really emblematic of this whole
moment in Tekashi's career,

1485
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:23,462
where he's trying to push out the people
who honestly got him where he was.

1486
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:25,172
DANIEL:
What's up, everybody?

1487
01:23:25,172 --> 01:23:28,050
So I'm letting everybody know
that I canceled my whole tour.

1488
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:31,470
The American dates is not happening.
It's not going down.

1489
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:33,347
I fired everybody in my team.

1490
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:36,183
I got no manager, I got no booking agent,
I got no PR, no public‐‐

1491
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:37,851
I don't got nobody on my team.

1492
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:38,894
It's just me...

1493
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:40,979
VIKRAM:
After his falling out with Shotti,

1494
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:45,150
6ix9ine was back to being a gang of one.

1495
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:46,777
CHARLEMAGNE:
Why did you fire everybody, 6ix9ine?

1496
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:48,403
DJ ENVY:
Yeah, we seen the video yesterday.

1497
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:50,322
DANIEL:
I learned the hard way, right?

1498
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:52,407
Every Blood is not your Blood.

1499
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:53,867
I'll just put that like that, right?

1500
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:54,826
CHARLEMAGNE:
Correct.

1501
01:23:55,494 --> 01:23:58,830
‐ There's a difference between
being a gang member...

1502
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,501
and just being a dirty nigga.

1503
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:03,669
‐ [chuckles]

1504
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:05,963
DANIEL:
Only two things I'm scared of in life.

1505
01:24:06,713 --> 01:24:08,006
God first.

1506
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,341
And the FBI.

1507
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:12,803
REPORTER: New information tonight
about the man who calls himself

1508
01:24:12,803 --> 01:24:14,096
Tekashi 6ix9ine.

1509
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:16,682
REPORTER 2:
Tekashi 6ix9ine was arrested.

1510
01:24:16,682 --> 01:24:18,892
REPORTER 3:
Tekashi 6ix9ine is in federal custody

1511
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:23,272
on racketeering and firearms charges,
along with several former associates.

1512
01:24:23,272 --> 01:24:25,858
REPORTER 4: The investigation
was a joint effort between ATF,

1513
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:28,193
the NYPD, and Homeland Security.

1514
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:31,697
REPORTER 5: Tekashi 6ix9ine
pleaded guilty to federal charges,

1515
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:33,448
admitted he participated
in a violent gang.

1516
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:36,034
He also pledged
to cooperate with prosecutors.

1517
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:39,580
He was facing a mandatory
47‐year prison sentence.

1518
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:45,752
VIKRAM: After his arrest,
his popularity reached new heights.

1519
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:51,425
This was 6ix9ine's crowning achievement.

1520
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:56,471
LAWYER: Mr. Hernandez, are you currently
in federal custody?

1521
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:57,514
DANIEL: Yes, sir.

1522
01:24:57,514 --> 01:25:00,100
LAWYER: Approximately when did
you start living in federal custody?

1523
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:03,145
DANIEL:
November 18, 2018.

1524
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:05,856
LAWYER: At some point, did you decide
to cooperate with the government?

1525
01:25:05,856 --> 01:25:07,065
DANIEL: Yes.

1526
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:08,442
LAWYER:
When did that happen?

1527
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:11,820
DANIEL: November 19th,
the day after we was taken down.

1528
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:16,491
LAWYER: Mr. Hernandez, do you
recognize anyone in the courtroom

1529
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:19,161
as a member of Nine Trey
when you were a member?

1530
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,746
‐ Yes.

1531
01:25:20,746 --> 01:25:22,080
LAWYER:
Who do you recognize?

1532
01:25:22,706 --> 01:25:26,668
‐ Harv Anthony Ellison has a gray suit on.

1533
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:29,755
VIKRAM:
His testimony helped the feds hand out

1534
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:31,965
over a hundred years of prison time

1535
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:33,425
to Harv,

1536
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:35,093
Shotti,

1537
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:36,261
Mel Murda,

1538
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:38,180
and eight other Nine Trey members.

1539
01:25:40,516 --> 01:25:42,434
‐ Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine...

1540
01:25:42,434 --> 01:25:44,228
WOMAN 1: Oh, no!
WOMAN 2: Why?

1541
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:45,854
‐ ...has been getting a bad rap lately

1542
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:48,857
for snitching on pretty much everyone
during his trial.

1543
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:50,400
‐ Snitching to stay out of jail.

1544
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,362
There's a chance he might even end up
in the Witness Protection Program.

1545
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:55,280
I'd love this guy to be
my milkman one day.

1546
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,115
HOWARD STERN:
He sang like a canary.

1547
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:58,992
‐ That motherfucker sang
like Aretha Franklin.

1548
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:00,744
[man laughing]

1549
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:03,372
‐ Snitch nine.
‐ Motherfuckers hate this guy.

1550
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:04,623
‐ Snitch.
‐ You're a rat...

1551
01:26:04,623 --> 01:26:05,791
‐ This nigga's crazy.

1552
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:07,751
R‐A‐T. Rat.

1553
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:10,170
‐ Shout out to Tekashi, though.
I hope he doesn't die.

1554
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,965
REPORTER: Tekashi 6ix9ine has gotten
a multimillion‐dollar record deal

1555
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:14,049
while he's in jail.

1556
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:16,552
REPORTER 2: Just cut a deal
worth more than $10 million...

1557
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:18,512
REPORTER 3:
...with his former label, 10K Projects.

1558
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:27,688
DERRICK PARKER:
While I was in the NYPD,

1559
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:30,148
they created a unit
that was called the Rap Unit.

1560
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:32,776
There was a lot of violence
in the rap music industry.

1561
01:26:32,776 --> 01:26:35,571
Rappers were perpetrators,
or they were victims.

1562
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:38,282
When Biggie got killed,
his death opened up the eyes

1563
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:39,992
of the police department.

1564
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:44,538
I had to go out and I had to monitor
where they went,

1565
01:26:44,538 --> 01:26:46,331
what kind of venues they went to.

1566
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:49,418
Not just to profile them
but to keep them out of trouble.

1567
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:53,005
VIKRAM: The feds had been monitoring
the Nine Trey Bloods for decades.

1568
01:26:53,005 --> 01:26:55,257
So 6ix9ine's social media presence

1569
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:58,218
gave them, and the entire world,
a window in.

1570
01:26:58,218 --> 01:27:02,222
‐ The federal government has wiretaps,
cell phone traps, traces.

1571
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:05,350
And remember, in New York City now,
we have cameras everywhere.

1572
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:07,352
You could say Big Brother's watching.

1573
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:10,063
What the feds discovered

1574
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:12,733
is that there was dissension
in the ranks,

1575
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:15,819
where this guy
wasn't getting enough money.

1576
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:17,571
This guy's looking to rob him.

1577
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:21,742
When he got involved with the Bloods,
there's really no way out.

1578
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:24,203
It's not like you could just walk away.

1579
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:27,915
And I know for a fact that, you know,
he was spoken to and talked to.

1580
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:29,708
You know?
VIKRAM: Before he was arrested?

1581
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:30,792
‐ Yes.

1582
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:37,466
VIKRAM: In one wiretap,
Shotti can be heard

1583
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:39,593
threatening 6ix9ine's life.

1584
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:43,597
‐ This is Mel Murda and Shotti
talking about 6ix9ine.

1585
01:27:57,194 --> 01:28:00,531
‐ The FBI used
some of the recordings to inform him,

1586
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:03,825
"Look, this is what's gonna happen to you
if you don't come onboard."

1587
01:28:03,825 --> 01:28:05,577
Remember, they had informants
inside the camp.

1588
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:10,332
VIKRAM: Do you know who
the FBI informant was?

1589
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:11,500
DERRICK: No.

1590
01:28:16,296 --> 01:28:18,298
♪

1591
01:29:56,563 --> 01:30:00,150
VIKRAM: After you got picked up
by the feds, did they wire you?

1592
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,568
Did they ever wiretap you?

1593
01:30:20,212 --> 01:30:22,464
VIKRAM: So, Jorge, you testified
in court, right?

1594
01:30:24,508 --> 01:30:26,969
VIKRAM: So the Bloods know
that you were involved in it.

1595
01:30:29,263 --> 01:30:30,973
VIKRAM: Are you nervous
about the Bloods right now?

1596
01:31:14,099 --> 01:31:16,476
‐ [distant horn honking]
‐ [muted crowd chatter]

1597
01:31:19,062 --> 01:31:23,025
VIKRAM: Our world's increasingly dominated
by extreme personalities.

1598
01:31:23,025 --> 01:31:26,278
The press and social media
can't get enough.

1599
01:31:26,278 --> 01:31:29,198
So it felt appropriate
that 6ix9ine's sentencing

1600
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:32,951
would be handed out on the same day
as Trump's impeachment.

1601
01:31:33,577 --> 01:31:37,247
As Danny took to the microphone
for his final statement to the court,

1602
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:40,125
a disheveled man
in his 50s raised his voice,

1603
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:43,086
proclaiming to be
Daniel's biological father.

1604
01:31:43,086 --> 01:31:44,963
Not the one who'd been murdered,

1605
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:48,175
but the man who'd abandoned the family
when Danny was just a boy.

1606
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:51,011
He'd not seen his son in nearly 15 years.

1607
01:31:51,762 --> 01:31:54,890
The courtroom, and Daniel,
were visibly shaken.

1608
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:58,310
Daniel said to the judge,
"My life is so crazy.

1609
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:00,812
I don't even know
if this is a joke anymore."

1610
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:04,816
Daniel was sentenced
to two years, with time served,

1611
01:32:04,816 --> 01:32:07,194
which meant he would be out
in less than a year.

1612
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:12,533
DANIEL HERNANDEZ SR.:
He got money.

1613
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:14,076
You know, he got millions.

1614
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:16,995
Why he have to do stuff
that is not worth it?

1615
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:18,455
You know what I'm saying?

1616
01:32:18,455 --> 01:32:20,499
I will sit down with him
and put him straight.

01:32:20,499 --> 01:32:22,042
REPORTER:
How do you feel right now?

1618
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:23,919
‐ Right now, I feel good, I feel good.

1619
01:32:23,919 --> 01:32:26,547
Only a little strange
'cause I got a lot of microphones

1620
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:28,549

For years, Daniel Hernandez Sr.

1625
01:32:47,192 --> 01:32:49,945
had been living
only a few miles from his son.

1626
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:54,700
I met him outside
his homeless shelter in Queens.

1627
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:57,035
DANIEL SR.: You know Tekashi 6ix9ine?
MAN: Uh‐huh.

1628
01:32:57,035 --> 01:32:58,745
DANIEL SR.: That's my son.
MAN: Oh.

1629
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:00,372
DANIEL SR.:
He's famous, a multimillionaire.

1630
01:33:00,372 --> 01:33:02,833
MAN: Good for you.
DANIEL SR.: Yeah. [laughs]

1631
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,293
God bless you.

1632
01:33:04,293 --> 01:33:06,336
VIKRAM:
In the brief time I spent with him,

1633
01:33:06,336 --> 01:33:10,007
he claimed to have insights
on his estranged son.

1634
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:11,884
DANIEL SR.:
He knows how I went to jail.

1635
01:33:11,884 --> 01:33:14,970
He knows I was locked up,
and he always wanted to be a gangster.

1636
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:17,723
All right? I know that affect him,
you know what I'm saying?

1637
01:33:17,723 --> 01:33:21,602
Because, uh, he...
I think he took that from me.

1638
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:24,563
VIKRAM: And he spoke of plans
to be in his son's life again.

1639
01:33:24,563 --> 01:33:27,941
DANIEL SR.: I would love to tell him
that I miss him,

1640
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:30,152
that I love him with all my heart,

1641
01:33:30,152 --> 01:33:32,446
that I'm looking forward to be with him.

1642
01:33:32,446 --> 01:33:34,489
VIKRAM:
And then he told me a bizarre story

1643
01:33:34,489 --> 01:33:36,700
of his connection to Daniel's stepfather,

1644
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,411
the man who had been murdered
years before.

1645
01:33:39,411 --> 01:33:42,748
DANIEL SR.: Uh, in the time
that I was locked up, I met him,

1646
01:33:42,748 --> 01:33:45,125
and when he got released,
I give him a letter, a note,

1647
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,878
for him to give it to my wife and my kids.

1648
01:33:47,878 --> 01:33:52,341
But when he went there,
he got involved with my wife.

1649
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:55,219
He built a relationship with my kids.

1650
01:33:55,219 --> 01:33:58,430
Real strong, you know, with Danielito

1651
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:00,182
and Oscar, right?

1652
01:34:00,182 --> 01:34:01,433
He used to play with them.

1653
01:34:01,433 --> 01:34:03,810
You know, he acted real close
to them and everything.

1654
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:06,522
And they loved him like he was his father.

1655
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:08,273
Because I wasn't there.

1656
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:12,152
VIKRAM:
How did that make you feel?

1657
01:34:12,152 --> 01:34:14,238
DANIEL SR.:
Oh, Lord, that hurt me so much.

1658
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:16,240
But anyway, he got what he deserved.

1659
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,742
VIKRAM: So you're kind of like
a little happy he got killed?

1660
01:34:18,742 --> 01:34:21,036
‐ Yes, I did. I ain't gonna lie.

1661
01:34:21,828 --> 01:34:23,872
I ain't gonna lie,
because I would have done it.

1662
01:34:23,872 --> 01:34:25,123
[laughs]

1663
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:26,208
You know?

1664
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:29,837
VIKRAM:
Even though he barely knew him,

1665
01:34:29,837 --> 01:34:33,715
so much of Danny's life
was shaped by this man's actions.

1666
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:37,636
And for a moment,
I felt a deep sympathy for Danny.

1667
01:34:37,636 --> 01:34:40,681
After all, he was only 23 years old.

1668
01:34:49,398 --> 01:34:52,985
So maybe you could just tell me
about why you're out here

1669
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:54,987
and left the city and...

1670
01:34:54,987 --> 01:34:58,198
SARA:
I just felt like it was necessary

1671
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:00,701
and it was something that had to be done.

1672
01:35:00,701 --> 01:35:03,954
Everything that was going on
was too chaotic.

1673
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:05,998
And it worried me.

1674
01:35:05,998 --> 01:35:08,166
It worried my family, too.

1675
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:10,085
Like, we didn't feel safe.

1676
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:16,049
VIKRAM: Do you think that the fact
that his father abandoned him

1677
01:35:16,049 --> 01:35:20,220
has an effect on how he has lived his life
and treats his daughter,

1678
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:21,763
and how do you see that...?

1679
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:24,308
‐ I don't... I don't correlate the two.

1680
01:35:24,308 --> 01:35:27,519
It's just, if that's something
you went through as a child,

1681
01:35:27,519 --> 01:35:28,478
you know the feeling.

1682
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:30,272
You know how it made you feel.

1683
01:35:30,272 --> 01:35:32,858
Why would you want
to put that on your kids?

1684
01:35:32,858 --> 01:35:35,110
Your job is to break the cycle.

1685
01:35:36,153 --> 01:35:38,697
Those little generational curses,

1686
01:35:38,697 --> 01:35:41,366
you should want and do better
for your kids.

1687
01:35:42,075 --> 01:35:44,995
His relationship with my daughter
is nonexistent.

1688
01:35:44,995 --> 01:35:48,999
He was never really
a present father at all, whatsoever.

1689
01:35:48,999 --> 01:35:51,502
He uses my daughter to gain likeness,

1690
01:35:51,502 --> 01:35:52,753
to gain sympathy.

1691
01:35:52,753 --> 01:35:54,671
Like, "Look, I'm a good dad."

1692
01:35:54,671 --> 01:35:56,965
Like, "I'm a good guy. I'm a dad.

1693
01:35:56,965 --> 01:35:59,051
"I have a daughter I care about.

1694
01:35:59,635 --> 01:36:02,262
"I need to come home, Judge, please.

1695
01:36:02,262 --> 01:36:06,058
I have... I wanna see my daughter,
my daughter, my daughter, my daughter."

1696
01:36:06,058 --> 01:36:09,311
He uses my daughter
when it's convenient for him.

1697
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:19,988
WIZARD:
Me knowing him on a personal level,

1698
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:24,243
I know the core person that he is,
and he's a really good person.

1699
01:36:24,243 --> 01:36:27,454
He didn't know boundaries,
he didn't know when to stop with things.

1700
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:29,665
There never will be
another 6ix9ine again.

1701

REBECCA:
I still cry. It breaks my heart.

1702
01:36:32,084 --> 01:36:33,961
It just breaks my heart.

1703
01:36:33,961 --> 01:36:38,215
I miss him and I feel bad
that he's in there, you know?

1704
01:36:38,215 --> 01:36:40,717
SHADOW:
Danny is the executive agent

1705
01:36:40,717 --> 01:36:42,302
and 6ix9ine is the artist.

1706
01:36:42,302 --> 01:36:45,597
Like I break it into two different people.
Like I know Danny.

1707
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:47,432
He's a quiet, conscious dude.

1708
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:50,853
Like he's not gangbang,
shoot‐em‐up, in your face.

1709
01:36:50,853 --> 01:36:53,188
Like he's not like that.
That's not how he was raised.

1710
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:58,151
Money and fame can really corrupt
a lot of people.

1711
01:36:58,151 --> 01:37:00,404
Not saying it corrupted him,
but I'm saying like,

1712
01:37:00,404 --> 01:37:03,782
that can really be the downfall,
the love of money.

1713
01:37:04,616 --> 01:37:08,120
DJ PVNCH: I think it was
an easy narrative to sell.

1714
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:11,623
There's this young Spanish boy
who got taken advantage

1715
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:14,251
by these aggressive, dangerous black men,

1716
01:37:14,251 --> 01:37:16,587
and they allowed him

1717
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:20,591
to put multiple black men into jail.

1718
01:37:20,591 --> 01:37:22,926
Shotti took 15 years.

1719
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:26,597

1722

Or because we might, you know,

you know, she might take them in

and feed them or whatever.

1725
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:43,405
But he took advantage.

1726
01:37:44,406 --> 01:37:46,992
‐ He slept on my floor, he ate my food,

1727
01:37:46,992 --> 01:37:50,370
and for the world,
he did not know what pie was.

1728
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:52,539
He ate Thanksgiving dinner with me.

1729
01:37:52,539 --> 01:37:55,792
He didn't know what pie was,

BILLY: To me,
it was just built in his ego and stuff.

1735
01:38:26,073 --> 01:38:27,991
He didn't care about the money to me.

1736
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:30,536
He didn't care about none of that stuff,
to be honest, me knowing Danny.

1737
01:38:30,536 --> 01:38:32,621
Of course, the money,
it was the perks of everything,

1738
01:38:32,621 --> 01:38:35,123

the remainder of his sentence

So within only a few weeks,
from an undisclosed location,

1745
01:39:01,233 --> 01:39:04,653
Tekashi 6ix9ine was back
on social media.

1746
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:11,285

I contacted his team and sent messages
