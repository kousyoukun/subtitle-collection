1
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,613
Yankee-nine-niner,
what are your coordinates?

2
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,948
Zero-two-zero, flight level one-five.

3
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,493
We're above release point Echo-Bravo-one.

4
00:01:58,577 --> 00:01:59,911
Move in and check it out.

5
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,621
Roger. Moving in.

6
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,800
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

7
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,510
No weapons evident.

8
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,347
Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.

9
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,349
I said the crowd is unarmed.

10
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,017
There are lots of women
and children down there.

11
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,685
All they want is food, for God's sake!

12
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,522
As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.

13
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,524
All rioters must be eliminated.

14
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,861
The hell with you.
I will not fire on helpless people.

15
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,823
Abort mission. We return back to base.

16
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,200
-Lieutenant Saunders, do you copy?
-Affirmative.

17
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,286
Take command.
Detain Richards and proceed as ordered.

18
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,956
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

19
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,415
Shit. Let's get him!

20
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,302
-God damn it!
-Shit, we're pitching over!

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,764
I got it! I got control!

22
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,519
They said detain him. Don't drop him.

23
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,987
Richards, you're gonna fry for this.

24
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,781
And I'll see you in hell.

25
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,130
Come on, keep digging.

26
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,925
-What's the holdup?
-This one's had it.

27
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,095
Watch the detonator.

28
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,809
Get that garbage out of here. Move!

29
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,499
Hey, Charley,
did you see The Running Man last night?

30
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,377
I never miss it. I even won 500 bucks.

31
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,505
You lucky bastard.

32
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,759
Work crew coming through.
Prisoner transfer to post.

33
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,344
Okay. Hang on.

34
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,514
Lenny, this is the East Perimeter.
Fresh meat just got here.

35
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,307
Shut down the deadline.

36
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,310
Affirmative. Shutting down now.
Stand clear.

37
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,398
Access code pending.

38
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,026
Verified. Perimeter deactivated.

39
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,778
Sonic deadline is down.

40
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,698
-Sonic deadline is down.
-Okay, assholes, move it. Move it.

41
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,408
Let's go. Let's go!

42
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,744
Get out the lead or lose your head.
Come on!

43
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,764
East Perimeter here.
New prisoners are all in compound.

44
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,849
We're clear.

45
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,184
Affirmative. Activating deadline.

46
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,396
What are you looking at? Get out of here.

47
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,734
Sonic deadline is up. Sonic deadline is up.

48
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:05,197
Prisoner restraint collars armed.
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

49
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,356
Give you a lift?

50
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,441
No, no!

51
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,116
-Get it open.
-I got it. I got it.

52
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:53,204
-Repeat the code.
-I did. 653...

53
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,747
Shit! It's not working.

54
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,087
-You're a hell of an actor, Laughlin.
-Who was acting?

55
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,922
Well, you're still alive, aren't you?

56
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,135
-Repeat that code.
-Okay.

57
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,684
Weiss, what's the holdup? Come on!

58
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,853
The linking computer's denying the code.

59
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,650
It must be the walls in here
blocking the signal.

60
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,569
-It's not happening.
-Then we try it outside. Move!

61
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,539
Hurry up! Let's go! Come on!

62
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,249
Get out of the way. Move!

63
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,210
Open the gates! Open the gates!

64
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,716
Go ahead! Do it!

65
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,261
Shut off the deadline
or we all lose our heads!

66
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,567
The system's locked.
Must be an encryption lockout.

67
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,860
Damn!

68
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,990
Perimeter deactivated.
Perimeter deactivated.

69
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,535
-All right! All right!
-Sonic deadline is down.

70
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,538
-Prisoner restraint collars disarmed.
-Chico! Amigo!

71
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,458
Chico! Come back! The deadline's still up.

72
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,379
He's not going to make it.
That collar's going to blow.

73
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,505
Sonic deadline is up.

74
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,965
Chico!

75
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,219
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

76
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,430
No, Chico!

77
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,142
Sonic deadline is up. Sonic deadline is up.

78
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,855
Prisoner restraint collars armed.
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

79
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,233
Sonic deadline is up. Sonic deadline is up.

Prisoner restraint collars armed.

Perimeter deactivated.

82
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:57,453
Perimeter deactivated.
Perimeter deactivated.

83
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,830
Perimeter deactivated.

84
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,952
Please observe and obey.

85
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,372
Zone passes are required at all times.

86
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,666
Display passes properly.

87
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,421
All inter-zone workers with day passes are
reminded that curfew begins at midnight.

88
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:54,218
Anyone without a valid zone card after
midnight will be permanently detained.

89
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:59,598
Cadre kids, don't forget,
October is bonus recruitment month.

90
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,269
Earn a double bonus
for reporting a family member.

91
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,647
ICS, your entertainment
and information network,

92
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,817
reminds you seeing is believing.

93
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:15,823
What's the number one television show
in the whole wide world?

94
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,993
-The Running Man!
-Yes!

95
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,203
Yes, it's The Running Man.

96
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,291
Four hundred square blocks of danger,
destruction, demolition, and...

97
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,668
You guys want to buy a hot stereo?

98
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,879
-Stevie.
-Laughlin. Glad you guys made it.

99
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,341
...unstoppable network stalkers
give criminals,

100
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:38,178
traitors and enemies of the state
exactly what they deserve.

101
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,765
Sundays, 8:00 to 11:00,
on ICS Channel One. Be there!

102
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,685
Produced in cooperation
with the Zone Four Department of Justice.

All rights reserved.

104
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:50,107
The Running Man,
America's favorite game show.

105
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,865
A child, your child, happy, loving, caring...

106
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,327
Can you believe this shit?
Twenty-four hours a day.

107
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,163
-Seven days a week.
-Don't listen to it.

108
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,958
I worry about the kids.
The network shuts down the schools.

109
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,711
The kids are either in hiding
or getting basic training,

110
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,838
brainwashed by the TV.

111
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,841
We can jam the network
once we find the uplink to the satellite.

112
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,801
Then we'll broadcast the truth.

113
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,804
Truth? Hasn't been very popular lately.

114
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,974
Can't find the code or the uplink.

115
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,312
Don't know where the network
hid something that big, but they managed.

116
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,106
Stevie, would you mind?

117
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,736
Goodbye, my lovely.

118
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,252
You're one of the cops
who locked up all my friends,

119
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,837
burned my songs.

120
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,091
People like you took this country
and turned it into a jail.

121
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,593
-We don't want his death on our hands.
-He's a cop.

122
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,638
-He's the Butcher of Bakersfield.
-Come on, Mic.

123
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,265
You can see through that crap.
It's network propaganda.

124
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,392
We don't know that.

125
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,185
We know we wouldn't be here
if he hadn't helped us.

126
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,521
We also know he's not one of us.

127
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,898
Perhaps now he's seen too much.

128
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,442
I've seen too much?

129
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,236
All I've seen is a bunch of low foreheads

130
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,947
who think they can change the world
with dreams and talk.

131
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,740
It's too late for that.

132
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,160
If you're not ready to act,
give me a break and shut up.

133
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,543
Nothing worth losing
your head over, though, huh?

134
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,214
You got it.

135
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,804
Hey, get out of here.

136
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,784
Well, there's your ride. It's all set.

137
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,412
Nothing like first class.

138
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,165
Señorita, señorita. You want to come in?

139
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,208
Yeah. Hey, you, too?

140
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,502
I guess this is it.

141
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,338
Now you, Weiss,
stay out of the National Database, okay?

142
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,551
And you, Laughlin, stop trying to teach
the constitution to the street punks.

143
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,888
-See you guys at the 10-year prison reunion.
-You can still join us if you want to.

144
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,390
No, thank you.
My brother's going to get me out of the city.

145
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,351
Plus, I'm not into politics. I'm into survival.

146
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,437
Nowadays, Fritz, it's the same thing.

147
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,190
Laughlin, save it for the written test.
Good luck.

148
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,858
Yeah, for all of us.

149
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,953
We need you, Damon!

150
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,960
Brenda, do you have this week's ratings,
or do I have to guess?

151
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,588
They're the same as last week,
and those were the same all last month.

152
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,758
I guess we've just peaked.
But it's not like we've dropped.

153
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,843
Not likely. You're beautiful, sweetheart.

154
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,846
-Sorry, Mr. Killian!
-Hey, that's all right.

155
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,473
-What's your name?
-Dan.

156
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,767
Dan, you're doing good work.
Looks beautiful. Don't worry.

157
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,018
-Thank you.
-Okay?

158
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,478
Thank you.

159
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,399
Brenda, if that asshole
is mopping the floor tomorrow,

160
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,777
you'll be mopping it
for the rest of the week. Let's go!

161
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,570
Security code accepted.

162
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,761
Edward?

163
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,390
Damon, were you down in wardrobe yet?
They've got your new jackets.

164
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,393
-They're fantastic!
-Who chose the colors?

165
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,688
-Hey, how are my people today?
-Fine, sir. Thank you.

166
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,566
You're looking good. Love that...
Tony! Tony!

167
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,360
-What have you got for me?
-Damon, thank God.

168
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,153
The Justice Department's been calling
every 10 minutes.

169
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,698
Just give them an evasive answer.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

170
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,408
You got my coffee?

171
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,453
-I want to know what we got, all right?
-All right. Let's see.

172
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,167
Lights.

173
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,965
Oh, God. Kitchen, toast and coffee.

174
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,718
ICS Channel One.

175
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,893
Are you ready for pain?
Are you ready for suffering?

176
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,270
If the answer is yes,

177
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,691
then you're ready
for Captain Freedom's Workout.

178
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,236
Yes, it's America's own Captain Freedom,

179
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,657
10-time national champion,
the greatest stalker to ever play the game.

180
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,244
All right, now, all you runners,
ready, get set, go!

181
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,580
We interrupt Captain Freedom's Workout
to bring you this urgent news bulletin.

182
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,208
The city police are engaged
in a door-to-door search

183
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,920
for Benjamin A. Richards,
known as the Butcher of Bakersfield.

184
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,258
Richards, a former police officer,
was the helicopter pilot

185
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,093
who went berserk 18 months ago,

186
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:37,139
firing without warning
on a crowd of innocent civilians.

187
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,184
If you see this man, do not approach him.
Contact your local block warden.

188
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,770
He is considered armed and dangerous.

189
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,772
Don't make a sound, you understand?

190
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,442
Who are you? A friend of my brother's?

191
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,281
-What are you talking about?
-This is his apartment.

192
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,949
I moved in last month.

193
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,910
They told me the last tenant
was taken away for...

194
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,413
-Yes?
-For re-education.

195
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,876
Help!

196
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,213
El asesino is in my house!

197
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,924
El Butcher of Bakersfield's in my bathroom!

198
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,886
That's the ticket. No pain, no gain.

199
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,347
Let go of me! Let me go! Let go!

200
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,559
Now, listen to me,
because I'm only going to say this once.

201
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,146
This is all a lie. I was framed.
I'm completely innocent.

202
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,399
-Yeah, sure.
-Now, be quiet and stay still.

203
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,693
I'm out of here in five minutes.

204
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,991
Hi, this is Amber. I'm not home right now.

205
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:42,329
I'm out somewhere having a wonderful time
with glamorous people in a fabulous place.

206
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,500
So, when you hear the tone, control
your jealousy and leave your message.

207
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,003
"Baby Face" March.

208
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,088
Are you kidding me? Next.

209
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,133
How's this one? Case 114. Schoolteacher.

210
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,553
Killed his wife and his mother-in-law
at a faculty dinner party with a steak knife.

211
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,597
Yeah. See I like that quality.

212
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,142
He's the sort that the neighbors say,
"Such a quiet man,

213
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,229
"but never too busy to say hello."
But look at him.

214
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,816
He weighs 120 pounds.
He wouldn't last 30 seconds.

215
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,943
Who else?

216
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,905
What about those bank robbers?
The ones who made that suicide pact.

217
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,367
-Did they commit suicide?
-Obviously not, Damon.

218
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,327
Then they're unreliable.

219
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,662
I got a friend at a talent agency.

220
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,497
Maybe they've got an ax-murderer
or something.

221
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,835
-Hello, gorgeous.
-Somebody with stamina.

222
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,962
Tony. Tony.

223
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,259
Pipe that feed in here now!
Take a look at this.

224
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,887
This is yesterday's prison break. Hey. Look!

225
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,851
Look at that mother move, huh?
Is he beautiful? Who is he?

226
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,061
Are you kidding? That's Ben Richards.

227
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,273
The cop from the massacre? Sensational.

228
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,484
-Perfect contestant. I want him!
-You can't have him.

229
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,610
Why not?

230
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,572
Damon, you know our contract.
We never get military prisoners.

231
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,408
Who's a military prisoner?
He's still at large.

232
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah? Well, they'll get him for me.

233
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,871
Cadres can't have it both ways.

234
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,833
They want ratings.
I can get 10 points for his biceps alone.

235
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,877
Hello. Yeah, this is Killian.

236
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,255
Get me the Justice Department,
Entertainment Division.

237
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:20,302
No, hold that.
Operator, get me the President's agent.

238
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,014
What is this?

239
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,517
That's my synthesizer setup. I'm a musician.

240
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,189
Well, I'm really a singer.
I write music for the network.

241
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,818
Have you heard of their theme song,
We Bring You Joy, We Bring You Strife?

242
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,403
Well, I wrote that.

243
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,614
You must be very proud of yourself.

244
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,535
-It's really nothing.
-Look at this.

245
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:51,333
They're all on the censored list.
And look what we have here.

246
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,127
This looks like black-market clothing.

247
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,796
And you wrote the network jingle.

248
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,715
Come on. Everybody does it.

249
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,842
Money.

250
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,220
That's what I need, money.

251
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,847
That money's
not going to do you any good.

252
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,307
You know,
you won't be able to leave this quad.

253
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,727
-You don't have a travel pass.
-You do.

254
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,230
Now I do.

255
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,068
Let's see.

256
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,909
Now where should we go?
Maybe someplace warm.

257
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,328
I need to work on my tan anyway.

258
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,498
You see, you get so pale in prison.

259
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,417
There you are. Good.

260
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,506
Now, I'm going to untie you,
and then you're going to get dressed,

261
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,928
-and then you're going to come with me.
-Yeah? Well, why should I?

262
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,599
Because I'm going to say please.

263
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,398
Well, why didn't you say so?

264
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,528
All flights to Pretoria, Tutuville
and Mandelaburg are on schedule.

265
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,990
Flights to Anaconda, Chile,
are delayed several hours.

266
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,952
All Mideast flights
are canceled until further notice.

267
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:14,791
You'll never pull this off, you know.
You are unarmed, outnumbered.

268
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,294
Face it. You're screwed.

269
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:22,007
So, why don't you just forget about all this
and turn yourself in?

270
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,593
You know,
you have a very negative attitude.

271
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,014
Now remember,
I can break your neck like a chicken's.

272
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,143
Travel pass.

273
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,231
What a beautiful day today.

274
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,984
I can practically taste
those piña coladas already.

275
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,028
-Right, sweetheart?
-Miss.

276
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,156
You didn't put it in your purse again,
did you?

277
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,160
Last vacation, she put my credit cards in
there and we couldn't find them for a week.

278
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,662
Here, could you hold on to this please?

279
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:56,166
You want to move it, up there?
We got a plane to catch.

280
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,792
Go on. Go on.

281
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,088
You can't live with them
and you can't live without them.

282
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:12,766
I'm warning you, I get sick.
Air sick, car sick.

283
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,144
I'm going to throw up all over you.

284
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,855
Go ahead. It won't show on this shirt.

285
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,289
Help! He's Ben Richards!

286
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,583
He's trying to kidnap me! Help!

287
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,753
Out of my way! Get the hell out of my way!

288
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,173
Positive ID. Benjamin A. Richards.

289
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,758
Priority one fugitive. Repeat.

290
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,510
All units, terminal seven.

291
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,822
All right. We're on him.
Close it in. Close it in.

292
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,038
Go, go, go. Move!

293
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,083
You move and you're dead!

294
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:43,940
Hi, cutie pie.
You know, one of us is in deep trouble.

295
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,736
-Do you know who I am?
-I've seen you before.

296
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,365
You're the asshole on TV.

297
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,493
That's funny. I was going to say
the same thing about you.

298
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:59,414
I saw the video of your prison break.
Sensational.

299
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,710
Ben, I think we might be able
to help each other out.

300
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,754
I've got the brains, and you've got talent.

301
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:12,510
No, you've got more. You've got talent,
you've got charisma and you've got balls.

302
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,972
That's why I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

303
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,143
And that's why I'd like you to volunteer

304
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,813
to appear on tomorrow's broadcast

305
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,400
-of The Running Man.
-Fuck you.

306
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,072
You're a brilliant conversationalist, Ben.
A trifle limited, but brilliant.

307
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,158
Take a look.

308
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,367
How long are they going to keep us here?

309
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,621
Isn't that your old schoolteacher
buddy there, huh?

310
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,082
And there's your other buddy, the one
who helped you in the prison infirmary.

311
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,627
Weiss, Laughlin.

312
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:51,674
-What are you going to do with them?
-Well, that's really up to you, Ben.

313
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:56,721
You see, I created The Running Man,
but I don't make the rules.

314
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,973
I've got a contract with the government.

315
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,392
They send me the convicts,
I put them on the show.

316
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,852
Well, you've seen it, right?

317
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:09,192
And you know at least you've got a chance,
but your buddies, Ben, they're the B-list.

318
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,155
So, if you don't do
The Running Man tomorrow,

319
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,328
Weiss and Laughlin
are going to go on in your place.

320
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,373
What do you say?

321
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,140
We'll see how far this clown runs
when we're done with him.

322
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,268
Starting barium IV.

323
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,648
-That's a go.
-Reading all systems down the line.

324
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,900
Your bird is singing loud and clear.

325
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,028
All systems check out.

326
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,989
Mandibular restraint.

327
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,372
Interphalangic injection.

328
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,671
Deltoid IM injection.

329
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:16,426
-Procedure completed.
-Takes care of him.

330
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,432
Sons of bitches.

331
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,477
He's wrapped. Knock him out till show time.

332
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,095
These guys, they never stop competing.

333
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,264
I get thirsty just watching them.

334
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:07,477
But in my line of work,
I can't afford that filled-up feeling.

335
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:13,483
That's why I drink Cadre Cola.
It hits the spot.

336
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,072
The capture of renegade police officer
and mass murderer Ben Richards

337
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,325
was filmed yesterday
by runway security cameras.

338
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,661
Richards' hostage, Amber Mendez,
was unharmed.

339
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,539
Some airport personnel were not so lucky,

340
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,584
like the ticket agent and security guard
Richards shot

341
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,670
at point blank range
when he arrived at the airport.

342
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,755
But that's not true.

343
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,676
They were taken to Cadre Memorial Hospital
where they remain in guarded condition.

344
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,554
And now back to Climbing for Dollars.

345
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,201
Mr. Richards.

346
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,038
I'm your court-appointed theatrical agent.

347
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,963
It's time.

348
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,184
And digital effects number one.

349
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,895
Roll process mod.

350
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,900
Okay, you guys. Hey, here we are. Come on.

351
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,071
Move, move. Come on.

352
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,241
Hey, over here. Here!

353
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,244
Big crowd tonight.

354
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,456
Better there than in the streets.

355
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,100
Buzzsaw, touch me! Buzzsaw!

356
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:18,191
-Who's the number one stalker?
-Buzzsaw.

357
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,110
Slice those runners for me, man.

358
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,489
He touched me! Did you guys see that?
Buzzsaw touched me!

359
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,840
Look at my power.

360
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,124
Don't touch the hair!

361
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,492
Look, do you have any more change?
I ran out.

362
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,370
-Yeah.
-Six dollars. Jesus, this place...

363
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,165
You're lucky to be alive.

364
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,169
I mean that guy just killed, what,
60, 80, 100 people?

365
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,799
-Not according to him, he hasn't.
-Well, that's what they all say.

366
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,676
"...and whereas the victim contests this,

367
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,138
"whereas network and victim
have in past been combatants,

368
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:16,976
"ad hoc de facto,
the parties herein have agreed to disagree.

369
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,520
"This is now mutually consented
to be de jure,

370
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,481
"and therefore parties have certain
obligations to each other.

371
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,942
"Respective rights and obligations..."

372
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:31,782
Boy, you're lucky he didn't kill you, too.
Or rape you and kill you.

373
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,744
Or kill you, then rape you.

374
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,288
"Conflicts between your estate
and the network..."

375
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,750
I mean, a guy like that,
what would stop him?

376
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,420
Yeah, what would?

377
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,883
Look, Amy, I have to pass on that drink.

378
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,093
I just remembered
that I have some paperwork to do.

379
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,179
-So, I'll catch you tomorrow, okay?
-And now, here's the producer

380
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:57,433
of The Running Man,
and everyone's favorite showman,

381
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,102
Damon Killian.

382
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,234
Yeah! Thank you. You're beautiful.

383
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,321
I love you. Yes!

384
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,533
You're beautiful. Thank you.

385
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,209
It's show time!

386
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,712
Yeah, yeah!

387
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:34,679
All right. Now, tell me,
what's the number one television show

388
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,264
in the whole wide world?

389
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,475
-The Running Man!
-The Running Man!

390
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,271
-And who loves you and who do you love?
-Damon!

391
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,899
-One more time!
-Damon!

392
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,067
Yes!

393
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,114
Phil, my announcer.

394
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,658
I heard the warm-up today,
and I've got to tell you,

395
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:59,328
honestly, Phil,
I don't think I've ever heard you funnier.

396
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,249
I'm just kidding, guys.
You're great at your job.

397
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,209
Too bad it isn't music!

398
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:11,507
"Res ipsa loquitur ad infinitum
for cassettes, videotapes, bubble-chips,

399
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,010
"and all other methods of recordings
known or unknown."

400
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,476
Sign here.

401
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,061
Hey.

402
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,526
Here, here, here. Use my back, victim.

403
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,871
Don't forget to send me a copy.

404
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,461
...the love of my life, my number one fan,

405
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:53,090
-Mrs. McArdle. How are you doing?
-Just fine.

406
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:57,052
I want a kiss, now, a big kiss.
But remember, no tongues.

407
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,309
-Bless you.
-Sit down, little darling.

408
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,479
We have one hell of a show for you tonight.

409
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,690
Phil, please, if you will,

410
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:14,570
introduce tonight's guest runner.

411
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,573
And watch that screen.

412
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,367
Our star runner tonight
needs no introduction.

413
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,911
He's Ben Richards,

414
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:27,458
the brutal slayer of 60 men, women
and children in the Bakersfield massacre.

415
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:33,088
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians. Moving in.

416
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,301
Yankee-nine-niner, the crowd in unarmed.
Repeat, unarmed.

417
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,137
Abort attack.
Acknowledge, Yankee-nine-niner.

418
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,140
-The hell with you!
-Lieutenant Saunders, take command.

419
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,559
Detain Richards and return to base.

420
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:49,647
Acknowledge, Yankee-nine-niner.
Acknowledge. Return to base.

421
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,359
Those are innocent, unarmed people
down there! Cease fire! Cease fire!

422
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,785
No.

423
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,052
Well, we all know the aftermath.

424
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,764
Grieving parents, orphaned children,

425
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,142
a nation shocked to its very core.

426
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,562
Here he is,

427
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,399
ready to pay the price
for our home audience,

428
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:38,988
in person, the Butcher of Bakersfield!

429
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,915
-Look at him!
-Get him!

430
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,297
Get him!

431
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:30,205
Now, Ben Richards could have gone
to prison to pay his penalty,

432
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,626
but instead, he volunteered
for The Running Man,

433
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,377
-risking everything for a chance...
-Excuse me.

434
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:39,548
...at our fabulous prizes
like a trial by jury, suspended sentence,

435
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,675
maybe even a full pardon,

436
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,096
like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

437
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,975
You remember them.
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

438
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:55,105
There they are and at this very moment,
they're basking under the Maui sun,

439
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,234
their debt to society paid in full.

440
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,236
Speaking of prizes,

441
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,198
you don't have to be a menace
to society to be a winner,

442
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,493
'cause you folks in the audience,
you'll get a chance, too.

443
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,746
Phil, tell our friends
what they can win today.

444
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,249
Damon, how about a year's supply
of Orthopure procreation pills,

445
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,334
both adult and kiddy sizes,

446
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,337
and the latest edition
of The Running Man home game?

447
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,257
Ben, I know you're just dying
to get into that game zone

448
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:26,470
and show us that same determination
you showed up in Bakersfield.

449
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,099
Well, first I've got a little surprise for you.

450
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:36,730
We all know you're a big, tough guy, Ben,

451
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,524
but that doesn't mean that you're a loner,

452
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:43,278
and it takes a big man
to admit that he needs his friends.

453
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,281
We didn't want to break up
a winning team, Ben,

454
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:50,411
so here they are,
ready to go for broke right by your side.

455
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,873
Ladies and gentlemen, Ben's buddies,

456
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,878
Harold Weiss and William Laughlin!

457
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,673
Son of a bitch.

458
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,679
You know how this works.

459
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,641
The game zone is divided
into 400 square blocks,

460
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,352
left over from the big quake of '97,

461
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,480
and I don't think any of us
will ever forget that.

462
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,735
Once inside the zone,
the runners have three hours.

463
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,696
They've got to go
through all four game quads.

464
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,741
Three hours or less,
and they're going to need every second,

465
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,909
'cause you know who's on their tail?

466
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,911
The stalkers!

467
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,748
-Who?
-The stalkers!

468
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:40,335
-And you know what happens then.
-Anything goes!

469
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,672
-What?
-Anything goes!

470
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:50,220
Right! Without further ado,
it's time to start running!

471
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,442
On your marks, get set...

472
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,904
Killian, I'll be back.

473
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,534
Only in a rerun.

474
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,661
Go!

475
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,627
-Go!
-You son of a bitch!

476
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,505
Go! Yes!

477
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,015
-...team in position.
-Lock down terminus impact net.

478
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,948
-All systems go.
-Vacuum sleds passing checkpoint one.

479
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,685
Come on, get up!

480
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,321
Edith Wiggins, come on down!

481
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,828
Yeah!

482
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:29,588
Edith, you look like you might have done
a little stalking yourself.

483
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,926
All right. Now, we need you
to give me the name of the stalker

484
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,346
that we send out to hunt down
those three desperate criminals.

485
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,932
-Okay.
-Give me 10 seconds please.

486
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,604
Place your bets. Place your bets.

487
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,237
Time's up.

488
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,780
No more bets.

489
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,907
Come on. Back off, back off. Come on.

490
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,244
-I don't know, they're all so good.
-Quickly.

491
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,621
Well, my husband and my little boy,
they have their favorites,

492
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,500
-but I like my men big and cuddly.
-Yeah?

493
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,002
-Who is it?
-Subzero!

494
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,588
All right. Okay.

495
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:16,385
We're looking for Subzero!

496
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,562
And now, our first stalker of the evening,

497
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:31,233
a Cadre trophy champion
with over 30 lifetime kills.

498
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,610
Let's welcome the incredible ice-man

499
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:38,073
who slices his enemies limb from limb
into quivering, bloody sushi,

500
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,492
Professor Subzero!

501
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,849
Move. Move it.

502
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,226
Come on. Let's go!

503
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,835
Damon, here in the locker room
there's a lot of excitement, here,

504
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,337
a lot of adrenaline.

505
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:38,175
The stalkers know there's
400 square blocks of game zone out there

506
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,219
and anything can happen
in the next three hours.

507
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,764
I remember once when I was in the...

508
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:48,643
Sorry, Cap, I've just been informed,
the runners have entered the first quad.

509
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,937
Let's go there now, live!

510
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,281
-What are we doing?
-Faster, Laughlin. Faster.

511
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,532
Keep going.

512
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,039
Come on, come on, bring your money.

513
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,749
Come on. Give it to me. Come on.

514
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,293
Fresh blood, first dibs. You pay
your money, you make your choice.

515
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,628
Come on. How about you?

516
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,261
It's cold.

517
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:42,531
What is this?

518
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,960
Guess they want us to stay.

519
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:06,972
Subzero does it again. A triple hit!

520
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:11,309
Let's get out of here. Come on!
Weiss, come on! Go.

521
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,674
Banzai!

522
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:48,096
Look at this, an ICS home video. Yeah!

523
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:53,935
And The Running Man
home version, right here.

524
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,396
Come on, get me out of here, you guys!

525
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,900
Hang on, Weiss. I'm coming.

526
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,202
-Come on, big boy!
-Yeah!

527
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,287
Richards?

528
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,749
Will, get me out of here, you guys!

529
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,839
Will, look out!

530
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,141
Kill that son of a bitch!

531
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,361
Come on! Yeah, Yeah!

532
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,822
Hey, Killian!

533
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,827
Here is Subzero,

534
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,413
now, plain zero.

535
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:52,429
Ladies and gentlemen, this is just horrible.

536
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:58,226
Words can't express
what we're all feeling at this very moment.

537
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,398
A great champion has fallen.

538
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:08,445
We'll be back
right after these important messages.

539
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,197
Pull!

540
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,326
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

541
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:20,040
-What the hell is that?
-It's gas.

542
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,500
-Let's get out of here. Come on.
-Come on.

543
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:26,546
-I'm sure glad we took care of Subzero.
-Yeah, he was a real pain in the neck.

544
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,799
I know... I know a stalker died.

545
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:33,511
Well, it had to happen sooner or later.

546
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,349
Yeah, well it is a contact sport, right?

547
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:43,355
Yeah, see, but you guys at Justice,
you cannot have it both ways.

548
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:48,401
You want ratings, you want people in front
of the TV sets instead of picket lines.

549
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,780
Well, you ain't going to get that
with reruns of Gilligan's Island.

550
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,449
Gilligan's Island.

551
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,704
Yeah, yeah, the one with the boat!

552
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,547
Fireball! Fireball!

553
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,549
Yeah, Buzzsaw!

554
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:12,634
Leon?

555
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:17,889
I don't know. I think maybe Dynamo,
but Buzzsaw was last year's champion.

556
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,350
I can't decide!

557
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,310
Then don't decide, Leon.

558
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:25,355
Hard decisions call for hard solutions.

559
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:29,651
And here are two hard-asses
ready to step in and take charge.

560
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,445
You asked for them, Leon. You got them.

561
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,574
Here they are, Buzzsaw and Dynamo!

562
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:42,247
Phil, tell us all about
this champion tag team.

563
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,249
Let's give a down-home welcome

564
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:48,211
to Buzzsaw Eddie Vatowski,
last season's leading stalker.

565
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:52,257
Buzzsaw's Hammond and Gage chainsaws
are made of Trylon-coated Dura-steel,

566
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:56,511
and can cut muscle, sinew, bone
or even solid steel!

567
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,937
-Well?
-Ratings just jumped eight points

568
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,272
right across the board.

569
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:08,898
-Eight?
-Make that nine points.

570
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,818
-I love Ben Richards.
-You want another surprise?

571
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,069
-What?
-Remember the girl

572
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,363
who was with Richards at the airport?

573
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,407
-The one with the cute ass?
-This is cuter.

574
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,035
They just caught her downstairs.
She was pulling the Bakersfield video.

575
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,580
Would you please welcome...

576
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,416
-Sensational.
-...our third stalker of the evening,

577
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Dynamo!

578
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,491
Thank you. You're beautiful.

579
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,910
Well, it's been an exciting show
so far, right?

580
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,496
We've had shocks, we've had surprises,

581
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,957
and we thought,
"Why not one more surprise?"

582
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:13,588
Will you please help me welcome
our mystery contestant,

583
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,299
Ms. Amber Mendez.

584
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,383
Stop that!

585
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,513
-Let me go!
-Amber.

586
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:26,184
Amber. Now, I understand
that you're single, Amber,

587
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,686
and that you live on the West Side.

588
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,814
And not surprisingly,

589
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:36,611
she has flaunted the law
and traditional morality all of her life.

590
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,948
Go ahead, tell some lies about me now.

591
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,992
We don't lie. Phil, tell us all about her.

592
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,373
It's clear. Come on.

593
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,041
Weiss, what is it?

594
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,670
The camera relay,
it's pointing into the zone, not up.

595
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:56,130
-Who gives a damn?
-Come on.

596
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,009
Hey, where are you going?

597
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,972
Later, she cheated on college exams,

598
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:10,061
had sexual relationships with two,
sometimes three different men in a year,

599
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:14,440
and then she met Mad Dog Ben Richards.

600
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,150
Her confederate.

601
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,444
Her lover.

602
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,905
That was a lie.

603
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,535
Dear, dear, dear.
Let's reunite these little lovebirds.

604
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,829
Go!

605
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,514
It's got to be here somewhere.

606
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,183
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

607
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,560
All the relays are the same.

608
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,478
They point into the middle
of the game zone.

609
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,147
Now, sooner or later,
they're gonna connect,

610
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,274
which means the uplink
to the network satellite is in there.

611
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,776
No wonder Mic's people couldn't find it.
No one ever comes out here.

612
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,570
If we can find that uplink,
we can crack the code.

613
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,447
We get it to Mic,
and the underground will jam the network.

614
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:03,823
-Jam the network?
-That's right.

615
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,117
Jam it up your ass.
Forget this crazy uplink business!

616
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,286
You're gonna get us all killed.
We've got to move on.

617
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,456
-Let's go, move! Move!
-Weiss! Sorry, Ben.

618
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,586
Christ.

619
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,728
Stalkers, we've got a bead,

620
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:38,107
20 degrees north, mark seven,
12 degrees east, mark two.

621
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,947
-Yes!
-Come on, brothers.

622
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,907
Let's win one for the Zero!

623
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:53,289
"Uplinks. Underground.
Uplinks. Underground."

624
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,125
If you guys don't shut up,
I'm going to uplink your ass

625
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,212
and you'll be underground.
Watch out, the lights!

626
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,389
-Let's get out of here.
-Someone's coming.

627
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,940
Hey! Hey! Richards, wait! It's Amber!

628
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,608
What the hell are you doing here?

629
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,568
Well, you don't have
to beat the crap out of me!

630
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:25,571
-You think I'm glad to be here?
-Who the hell is this?

631
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,034
She's the one that turned me in
at the airport. Guess this is her reward.

632
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:32,537
Yeah, go ahead. Make jokes.

633
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,038
It's your fault I'm here.

634
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:37,709
The police think I'm helping you out.
They even think I'm your girlfriend.

635
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:38,960
Well, I can straighten that out.

636
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,755
See this camera up there?
I can strangle you for the home audience.

637
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,007
-Another relay.
-Where?

638
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,216
-They're out here.
-Weiss!

639
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,135
-What's he talking about?
-Come on.

640
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,219
Let's go.

641
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,805
Weiss! Over here! Over here!

642
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,690
Richards, cuidado!

643
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,627
You son of a bitch!

644
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,340
Richards, help! Where are we going?

645
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,010
Laughlin!

646
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,190
-In here?
-Yeah, let's go.

647
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:47,236
Give me your money. Okay.

648
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,914
Hey, man, what are you doing? Hey!

649
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,709
The resistance has been trying
to jam the network for five years,

650
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:03,127
and this could be our chance.

651
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,712
-Let's go.
-No.

652
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:06,964
This is more important.

653
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:11,135
-It's the uplink to the network satellite.
-But he's going to find us.

654
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,179
Weiss, come on. Weiss.

655
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,312
Over there.

656
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,868
Who loves you and who do you love?

657
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:38,579
Let me hear it.

658
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,997
You've got it.

659
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:45,670
Who loves you and who do you love?

660
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:46,754
Let me hear it.

661
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,631
One more time.

662
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:04,939
Laughlin!

663
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,526
Hang on, I've got you.

664
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,529
Run. Get out of there. Get out of there!

665
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,458
Laughlin, get up.

666
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,218
Go, go, go.

667
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,506
-Here you go, Leon.
-Wow, yeah.

668
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,467
The Running Man home game.

669
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,368
It's okay. It's okay, man.

670
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,786
-Don't worry, don't worry.
-Don't worry.

671
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,205
-You make more money.
-You make more money.

672
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:51,212
Let's get out of here, Weiss.
He's gonna find us.

673
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,384
-Jackpot.
-What are you doing? Weiss?

674
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,470
What are you doing?

675
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:04,308
-What's this, Weiss?
-It's the uplink interface. Look out.

676
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,772
Great, hexagonal decode system.

677
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,400
Not impossible,
it's just gonna take a little time.

678
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,113
-Your name is Amber, right?
-Yeah.

679
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,991
Okay, Amber, I'm going to need you
to remember these numbers.

680
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:21,867
We've got to get them to Mic,
and the resistance.

681
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,246
All right, all right, I will. But then, let's go.

682
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,412
Richards! I love this saw.

683
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,956
This saw's part of me.

684
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,667
And I'm gonna make it part of you!

685
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,233
That's all right.

686
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,610
Keep it.

687
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:30,371
God.

688
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,175
18-24.

689
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,220
Come on.

690
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:50,141
-18-24.
-61-B.

691
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,810
Say them.

692
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,646
-Say them.
-18-24-61-B.

693
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,148
-Can we go now?
-Not yet.

694
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:01,485
-Not yet? What do you mean, not yet?
-17-17.

695
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,451
-4.
-17-7-4.

696
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,079
-17-17-4.
-Why...

697
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:14,999
-Come to me, my love.
-Oh, my God.

698
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,460
No!

699
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,740
Let me go! Richards!

700
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,409
Hey, light-head!

701
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,120
-Hey, Christmas tree!
-Richards.

702
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,140
Shit!

703
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,147
All right, all right.

704
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,321
Follow me, light bulb.

705
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:31,742
Got you!

706
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,093
Come on!

707
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,511
All right, all right.

708
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,699
Oh, God. I'm stuck.

709
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,910
Somebody help me!

710
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,623
God. Cut, go to commercial. Jesus Christ!

711
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,419
I have no power! Cut! Go to commercial!

712
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:30,801
Kill him!

713
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:39,101
No. I won't kill a helpless human being,

714
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,396
not even sadistic scum like you.

715
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,399
Oh, my God.

716
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,110
Come on.

717
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,695
Do it.

718
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:58,287
-What happened to Buzzsaw?
-He had to split.

719
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:02,416
Hey, what an incredible battle!

720
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:06,503
Buzzsaw gone, Dynamo down,

721
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:11,008
but the stalk isn't over till the fat lady sings,

722
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,843
and the very last criminal...

723
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:18,015
Fireball, report to wardrobe at once.
Fireball, you are wanted in wardrobe.

724
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:21,018
...and our halftime show.

725
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,857
Laughlin, break's over.

726
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,778
Come on, let's get going. Come on.

727
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,197
I'm going somewhere, but not with you.

728
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:36,742
Buzzsaw took care
of my traveling arrangements.

729
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:43,457
Oh, my God.

730
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:49,463
-Weiss?
-He's dead.

731
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,970
But he gave me the code,
the satellite uplink code.

732
01:06:58,098 --> 01:07:01,642
The underground has a broadcast center
in quadrant four.

733
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,312
Take her. Take her and the code to Mic.

734
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,941
Don't let us die for nothing.

735
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:13,320
Listen, we're counting on you.
Don't let us down.

736
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:20,661
I don't want to be the only asshole
in heaven, Ben.

737
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,637
He saved my life.

738
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,599
It should be me down there.

739
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,227
We got them? Hey, Ben.

740
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,397
Ben, I got to hand it to you, pal.

741
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,775
You got the whole network here
in an uproar.

742
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:56,363
Why, they're shipping bicarb
to the Justice Department in crates.

743
01:07:56,656 --> 01:08:00,075
So that's why this little call
is just between you and I.

744
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,827
It's not going out on the air.

745
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,620
Listen very carefully, Ben.

746
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,875
How would you like
a three-year contract, guaranteed,

747
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:12,212
a Cadre credit line,
and a beachfront condo?

748
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,464
Sound impossible?

749
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:17,342
Ben, that's the standard deal
for a network stalker.

750
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,220
And I know real talent when I see it, Ben.

751
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,599
And I'd just hate to see you
get canceled tonight

752
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,434
when you could go the distance.

753
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:29,772
Say the word, Ben, and you could be
the one doing the stalking.

754
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,231
What do you think?

755
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,989
You cold-blooded bastard!
I'll tell you what I think of it!

756
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,200
I'll live to see you eat that contract.

757
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,035
But I hope you leave enough room
for my fist,

758
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,037
because I'm going to ram it
into your stomach

759
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,414
and break your goddamn spine!

760
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,466
Damon, it's for you.

761
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,635
-Who?
-It's the Attorney General.

762
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:05,265
Get out. Everybody out. Come on. Move.

763
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,438
Yes?

764
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:16,109
Fireball! Fireball! Fireball! Fireball!

765
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,363
Fireball!

766
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,701
Come on, Fireball!

767
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,269
Let's go!

768
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,823
Yeah! He's my hero. He's my hero.

769
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:34,146
And there he goes. Fireball's on his way.
And Dynamo's down, but not out.

770
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,274
-Back to you, Damon.
-Hey! All right, Agnes.

771
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:41,278
Listen now, big chance for you.
Win a whole lot of prizes.

772
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:44,573
You know we've still got
two crack stalkers out there, right?

773
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:48,535
Dynamo and Fireball.
Who do you think will make the next kill?

774
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,496
Oh, boy, that's a tough one.

775
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:53,457
Come on, give it a try. You can do it.

776
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,709
-Who do you think?
-Okay.

777
01:10:56,169 --> 01:11:00,047
I think the next kill will be made by

778
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:01,965
Ben Richards.

779
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,176
-You can't do that.
-Hold it, hold it.

780
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:09,264
Agnes, Richards is a runner.
You've got to pick a stalker.

781
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,642
I can pick anyone I choose,

782
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:13,226
and I choose

783
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,938
-Ben Richards.
-Richards?

784
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,440
That boy's one mean motherfucker.

785
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:25,656
$200 on Richards.
Come on, 200 on Richards.

786
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,743
$200 on Richards. Come on, you got it.

787
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,579
-Let's do it?
-Yeah, just do it, just do it.

788
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:33,705
Okay, okay.

789
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,958
-Okay, man, you want it, you got it.
-Yeah, yeah.

790
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,626
All right, Richards!

791
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:42,673
Place your bets. Place your bets.
Two-five, two-five.

792
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:47,678
Secret broadcast center, my ass.

793
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,513
I don't know
what Laughlin was talking about.

794
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,181
There's nothing out here.

795
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:55,018
Me and my big mouth.
We should have taken the trip to Hawaii.

796
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:57,771
I had the shirt for it, but you fucked it up.

797
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,608
-Jesus Christ.
-Guess again.

798
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:23,463
-Come on, keep up.
-I'm running too fast. My feet can't keep up.

799
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:28,218
There we go. The number one rusher.

800
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:32,806
He smells blood,
and nothing on Earth is gonna stop him.

801
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:42,816
This way.

802
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,234
Why here? No, I want to go that way.

803
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,403
-I think that... Let go.
-Let's go.

804
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,950
You're gonna get us killed.

805
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,913
Stop it!

806
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:00,751
Richards! Let me go!

807
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,213
Burn them. Good.

808
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,866
Amber, get out of here.

809
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,036
Go!

810
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,206
Move!

811
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:08,735
Amber?

812
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:18,370
Richards?

813
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,341
Richards?

814
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:43,645
Richards?

815
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,634
Whitman.

816
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:27,981
Price.

817
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:33,862
Haddad.

818
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,580
They're Running Men.

819
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,208
Last season's winners.

820
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:50,629
No, last season's losers.

821
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:12,525
My gas line! My gas line!

822
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,946
How about a light?

823
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:33,838
What a hothead.

824
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,428
-Yeah, Richards!
-Get him, Richards.

825
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,264
Captain Freedom to wardrobe.

826
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,349
Captain Freedom to wardrobe,
on the double.

827
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,703
Forget it, Killian! I won't do it.

828
01:17:04,996 --> 01:17:07,580
It's not a request, moron. It's an order.

829
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,582
I don't need this crap!

830
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:12,836
This stuff is garbage!

831
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:21,928
I was killing guys like this 10 years ago
with my bare hands!

832
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:26,766
I'm not going for any of these tricks!
This is a sport of death and honor!

833
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,351
Code of the gladiators!

834
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:31,438
Cap, will you spare me
the combat Zen speech?

835
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:35,984
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you see what's going on out there?

836
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:39,821
This isn't a game!
They're betting on Richards up there!

837
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:43,116
-Bullshit!
-Get out of here.

838
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,453
Get him out of here!

839
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:50,206
What's the matter, steroids make you deaf?

840
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,292
Get him out of here, now!

841
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:07,223
Now what?

842
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,976
Now let's find Mic's secret broadcast center,

843
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:12,270
if it even exists.

844
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,314
Shit!

845
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:18,443
Let's try that way.

846
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,117
We're trapped.

847
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:30,455
Subzero, Fireball

848
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,165
and Buzzsaw.

849
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:36,586
Say their names with reverent pride.

850
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:40,090
They punished crime and served the law.

851
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:42,759
As patriots, they died.

852
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,597
This is what I hate. Third-act problems.

853
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,808
Roll stock.

854
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,685
Freeze in digital memory.

855
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:57,065
-And...
-Activate traveling matte.

856
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:02,612
Tony, this better work, pal,
or you'll be a digital memory.

857
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:03,780
Take it easy, Damon.

858
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:05,615
We're loading Richards' image
onto the database,

859
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,534
and when he's mapped
onto the stunt double,

860
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:10,412
you'll never know the difference.

861
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,081
All right, boys. Let's see you dance.

862
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,920
Sensational. I love it!

863
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:25,885
Mr. Richards, I'm surprised
you were so easily caught.

864
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:33,893
Welcome to the people's network.
We've been waiting for you.

865
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,604
This is nice, Mic.

866
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,065
But it would have been nicer
if you would have gotten off your asses

867
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,609
-and helped us out there.
-We couldn't.

868
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:44,946
We'd have been seen, and the government
would have found this place.

869
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,740
Laughlin, Weiss,
would have died for nothing.

870
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:49,242
They didn't.

871
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,203
I have the uplink code.

872
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,330
Ladies and gentleman,

873
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:57,917
I've just got an update
on tonight's incredible action.

874
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:01,421
The runners have entered the final quad.

875
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:04,674
And Captain Freedom
has hung up his announcer's mike

876
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,217
and come out of retirement.

877
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:09,471
He's suited up
and ready for the final conflict.

878
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,348
Let's go now, live to the game zone.

879
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:42,480
Yes, it's all over! What a colossal fight!
This is an incredible moment in sports.

880
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:46,109
Captain Freedom out of retirement
and still undefeated champion.

881
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:50,154
Proving once again that right and might
are one and the same.

882
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:55,535
Damn that Killian!

883
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:59,414
What's wrong? You should be happy.
We're officially dead.

884
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:02,917
-We can go anywhere, do anything.
-No, don't you understand it?

885
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:05,545
He'll never let us out of here alive.
They can't afford it.

886
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,464
They'll get the police, the army,
and hunt us down like dogs,

887
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:10,383
off-camera, of course.

888
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,887
Okay. Dismantle all the overlays.

889
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:18,182
Put the digital matte
in the pixel memory storage.

890
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,018
You know, the damn thing
worked like a charm.

891
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:24,063
It should. Editel charged us
an arm and a leg for the software.

892
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,525
Damon, you didn't have to kill him.

893
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:33,364
It's all a part of life's rich pattern, Brenda,
and you better fucking get used to it.

894
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:37,160
That's the one for the awards show, huh?
Thank you. You're doing nice work.

895
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:38,411
I thank you.

896
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,788
Tony, you're finally getting it.

897
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:45,293
Guns. You don't need guns
to jam a satellite.

898
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,045
I do, to keep it.

899
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,546
The minute I steal the signal,

900
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:51,799
the network will try to shunt
the next one in orbit.

901
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,344
Stevie's group is going inside
to stop them now.

902
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,845
These kids?

903
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,514
That's a bad move, Mic.

904
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,643
They need a leader.
They need someone with experience.

905
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:04,437
I thought you were looking for the door.

906
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,275
I told Killian I'd be back.

907
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:12,820
I wouldn't want to be a liar.

908
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,781
Listen up, everybody.

909
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:19,619
I want you to all to consider yourselves
picked up for the rest of the season, okay?

910
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:25,583
What are you, my people or an oil painting?
We're up nine points!

911
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:27,919
Come on, now. Let's go, champ.

912
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:34,050
We're going to send the uplink code
in 20 minutes.

913
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:36,803
Ten seconds later, I'll go on the air.

914
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,847
-We'll be ready.
-If you want to make an impression,

915
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:43,142
forget the speech. Try this instead.

916
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,353
What is it?

917
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,481
It's the original video
from the Bakersfield massacre,

918
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,817
before they edited for broadcasting.

919
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:04,455
Where did you hide that?

920
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,542
It's none of your business.

921
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:21,889
Hey, what the hell?

922
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:39,574
-Six minutes.
-Begin satellite coding sequence.

923
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,785
Load uplink code into transponder grid.

924
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:47,832
Shunt power to main circuits.
Mr. Spock, you have the com.

925
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:51,294
Who's Mr. Spock?

926
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,854
Come on, let me hear it now.

927
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:12,023
Yeah.

928
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:16,569
Welcome to the post-game wrap-up show.

929
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,404
Ladies, I love you.

930
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,574
Thank you, young man.

931
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:24,827
-Hello. You're on the air.
-Hi, Damon. My name is Wendy.

932
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:28,414
Listen, I have a question about Dynamo.
Is he seriously hurt or what?

933
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:31,501
He's gonna be fine, love. Fortunately, see...

934
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,629
-Good luck.
-...Dynamo is still under factory warranty.

935
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,172
You, too.

936
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:37,215
You're on the air.

937
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:39,842
Damon, I feel so bad
about the dead stalkers.

938
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:43,137
Is there any way I can make a donation
to help out their families?

939
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,556
What a darling you are. Yes, my doll.

940
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:50,061
All you do, you send your checks
to the patriots fund, care of this station.

941
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:55,775
Three, two, one, that's it.

942
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,944
We got it! We got that baby!

943
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:00,738
Those contributions are tax deductible.

944
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:05,409
And who loves you and who do you love?

945
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:07,078
Damon!

946
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,372
Yes. Yes. Yes.

947
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:13,376
Hey, what's going on?

948
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:15,545
We don't lie.

949
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:19,882
...like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

950
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:23,553
You remember them.
There they are and at this very moment

951
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:26,180
basking under the Maui sun,

952
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:29,225
their debt to society paid in full.

953
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:31,936
Watch that screen.

954
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,939
Yankee-nine-niner,
what's the status of the crowd?

955
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:39,443
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

956
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,571
No weapons are evident.

957
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:44,866
Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.

958
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,617
I said the crowd is unarmed.

959
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,744
There are lots of women
and children down there.

960
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:50,663
All they want is some food, for God's sake!

961
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:52,999
As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.

962
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:56,085
-All rioters must be eliminated.
-The hell with you.

963
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:58,713
-I will not fire at helpless human beings.
-You have your orders...

964
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:01,924
-Where's it coming from?
-The network satellite.

965
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,678
Abort mission. Return to base.

966
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,055
Don't touch that dial.

967
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:11,017
Detain Richards and proceed as ordered.

968
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,895
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

969
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,067
Ladies and gentlemen!

970
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:23,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll please bear with us,

971
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,116
-we're experiencing technical difficulties.
-Bullshit!

972
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,082
It's show time.

973
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:53,351
Get the people out.
Come on, get the people out.

974
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,825
Thought it was pretty funny
out there in the zone?

975
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:14,372
What's the matter now, bitch?
Why aren't you laughing?

976
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:16,040
Because there's nothing funny

977
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,418
about a dickless moron
with a battery up his ass.

978
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:32,723
Out, out.

979
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,439
I'll show you dickless.

980
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:24,150
-Get out of my way!
-Get down! Down!

981
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:31,657
Let's go!

982
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,985
Hello, cutie pie.

983
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,866
One of us is in deep trouble.

984
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:34,512
Sven, do you wanna talk to Mr. Richards?

985
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:42,478
Well?

986
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:48,484
I got to score some steroids.

987
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:57,993
You look pissed, Ben.

988
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,875
Believe me, you got every right to be.

989
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,878
But, hey, will you just let me explain?

990
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,339
This is television, that's all it is.

991
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:13,259
It's nothing to do with people.
It's to do with the ratings.

992
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:18,889
For 50 years, we've told them what to eat,
what to drink, what to wear.

993
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:21,350
For Christ's sake,
Ben, don't you understand?

994
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:25,604
Americans love television.
They wean their kids on it.

995
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:29,024
Listen, they love game shows,
they love wrestling,

996
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,485
they love sports and violence.

997
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,696
So what do we do?

998
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:36,407
We give them what they want.

999
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,494
We're number one, Ben.
That's all that counts.

1000
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:43,789
Believe me,
I've been in the business 30 years.

1001
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,418
Well, I haven't been in show business
as long as you have, Killian,

1002
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,461
but I'm a quick learner.

1003
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:52,715
So, I'm going to give the audience
what I think they want.

1004
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:53,799
Wait.

1005
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:01,307
You bastard. Drop dead!

1006
01:32:02,309 --> 01:32:04,101
I don't do requests.

1007
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,776
No!

1008
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:57,863
Well, that hit the spot.

1009
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:07,623
Yeah! All right, yeah!

1010
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:13,671
Take him out!

1011
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:24,515
Richards! Richards! Richards!
Richards! Richards! Richards!

1012
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:14,865
The Running Man
has been brought to you by

1013
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:19,953
Breakaway paramilitary uniforms,
Orthopure procreation pills

1014
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:23,624
and Cadre Cola. It hits the spot!

1015
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:27,377
Promotional considerations
paid for by Kelton flamethrowers,

1016
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:32,049
Wainwright electrical launchers,
and Hammond and Gage chainsaws.

1017
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,801
Damon Killian's wardrobe by Chez Antoine,

1018
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:38,889
19th-century craftsmanship
for the 21st-century man.

1019
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,058
Cadre trooper and studio guard sidearms

1020
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:44,853
provided by Colchester,
the pistol of patriots.

1021
01:39:44,937 --> 01:39:48,523
Remember, tickets for the ICS studio tour
are always available

1022
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,443
for Class A citizens in good standing.

1023
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:54,363
If you'd like to be a contestant
on The Running Man,

1024
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:58,200
send a self-addressed, stamped envelope
to "ICS Talent Hunt,"

1025
01:39:58,284 --> 01:39:59,534
care of your local affiliate,

1026
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:02,954
and then go out
and do something really despicable.

1027
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:06,625
I'm Phil Hilton. Good night, and take care.
