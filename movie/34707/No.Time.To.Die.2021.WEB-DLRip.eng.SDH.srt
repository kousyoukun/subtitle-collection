Well,
isn't this a surprise, Felix?

341
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:52,933
James.

342
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:55,153
Who's the blond?

343
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,505
Logan Ash, State Department.
It's really nice to meet you.

344
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:03,770
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, I'm a huge fan.

I need a favor, brother.

You didn't get the memo?
I'm retired.

348
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,602
[Felix] I wouldn't ask
if you were still

349
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:11,343
in Her Majesty's Service.

350
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:12,605
And what does that mean?

351
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:16,826
Our elected leaders aren't
playing nice in the sandbox.

352

James.

353
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,399
Is there somewhere quiet
where we can talk in private?

354
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,882
Quiet? Yeah.

356
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,234
[Felix] I was hoping
you could pick up
a package.

357
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,279
-[Bond] Five.
-[Felix] Four.

Where's the package?

359
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,719
Short trip. Cuba.

360
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:41,416
You love it there. [laughing]

361
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,244
Oh, I love it there?

362
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,638
Hey. Valdo Obruchev.

363
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:47,292
[Felix] You're gonna say
you never heard of him.

364
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,033
-Never heard of him. Two.
-Three.

365
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:53,123
Ah... It's a good life.

366
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,474
[laughs]
You never heard of him?

367
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,519
Didn't he defect
during your tenure at MI6?

368
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,652
Obruchev was kidnapped
three days ago

369
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,915
from a secret MI6 lab
in London.

370
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,657
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep

371
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,181
in Santiago de Cuba.

372

I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.

375
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,321
Coincidence?
[clicks tongue]

376
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:20,412
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

377
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:22,675
-Three.
-Two.

[Felix laughs]

379
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:28,898
[Ash] You're really
the only guy for the job.

[both chuckle]

381
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,902

Hi.

-Scotch.
-Yeah, man.

[indistinct chatter

Where'd you find
the Book of Mormon?

387
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:57,536
[Felix] Political appointee.
Not my choice.

388
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,668
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.

389

He smiles too much.

390
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,282
Help us get this
into the right hands.

391
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,718
Oh, what,
and you're the right hands?

392
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:07,415
I'm not just a pretty face.

393
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:10,026
I stopped trusting
pretty faces
a long time ago, Felix.

394
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,028
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.

395
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,596
-Bad judgment.
-Yeah.

396
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,250
Harder to tell
the good from bad,

397
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,773

these days.

398

I need you, James.

399
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:22,343
You're the only one
I trust with this.

400
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:23,910
I'm not screwing around.

401
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,303
I wanna get back to my family,

402
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,087
tell them
I saved the world again.

403

Don't you?

404
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,441
Nice to see you again, Felix.

405
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:37,532

-I've got your number.

Sure. Why not?

Hold on.

-I'm a diver.

-What do you dive for?
-I have a thing for old wrecks.

come to the right place.

Nice house.

421
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:01,094
Thank you.

422
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,051
Is that the bedroom?

423
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,579
Yes, it is.

[switch clicks]

425
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:27,425
Well,
that's not the first thing

426
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,078
I thought you'd take off,
but, uh...

427
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,950
[in British accent] Yeah.

428
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,996
You seem like a man
who's gagging

429
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,131
-for some action, Mr. Bond.
-Shall we cut to the chase?

430
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,133
I'm here
as a professional courtesy.

431
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,221
Well, you're not very
courteous, are you?

432
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,397
You've broken my car...

433
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,312
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.

-Two years.

-High achiever.

-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-The world's moved on

437
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:55,714
since you retired,
Commander Bond.

438
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:57,455
-Perhaps you didn't notice.
-No, can't say I had.

439
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,370
And in my humble opinion,

440
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:01,894
the world
doesn't change very much.

441
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:04,070
You would say that.

442
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:05,767
Look,
this all seems like heaven,

443
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,421
this little bubble,
or whatever.

444
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,988
-[laughs]
-But it's so obvious

445
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,251
you're a man
who only has time to kill,

446
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,166
nothing to live for.

447
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:16,822
So Valdo Obruchev
is off-limits.

448
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:19,085
You get in my way, I will put
a bullet in your knee.

449
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,044
[whispers]
The one that works.

450
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,614
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.

451
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,011
MI6, CIA
chasing after the same man,

452
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:34,796
not communicating
with each other, that...

453
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,625
-That's not good.
-Hmm.

454
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:40,976
You know what?
Tell M hello, but...

455
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,847
I don't work for him anymore.

456
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,328
Tell him yourself.

457
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,768
By the way,

458
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,726
I'm not just any old double-0.

459
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:54,337
I'm 007.

460
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,603
You probably
thought they'd retire it.

461
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:04,043
-It's just a number.
-[scoffs]

462
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,174
Yeah.

463
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:07,655
See you in Cuba?

464
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,355
[M] How's it going, Q?

465
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:14,444
Several large files seem
to have been wiped

466
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:16,011
from Obruchev's hard drive.

467
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,623
He was working on some
pretty advanced algorithm...

468
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,408
-Can you retrieve the files?
-Trying.

469
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:23,758
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.

470
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:25,499
If I knew more about
what this was, I could...

471
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,154
-Thank you, Q. That's all.
-[cell phone ringing]

472
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:29,851
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.

473
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:31,723
007.
Tell them something. Anything.

474
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,771
-007.
-[Bond] M, darling.

475
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:37,685
Couple of things.

476
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,603
-Bond.
-I met your new 007.

477
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,170
She's a disarming young woman.

478
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:47,608
So, Obruchev.

479
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,523
You kept him
on the payroll, didn't you?

480
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,091
Stay out of it.
This has nothing
to do with you.

481
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,397
It does. It's Spectre.

482
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:58,053
Mallory, what have you done?

483
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:01,100

-Double-0 trouble?
-The CIA have the advantage.

486
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:12,415
Get me Blofeld.

487
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,113
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.

488
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:15,810
I know.
The live feed's what I want.

489
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:24,427
[Blofeld] They stay
straight in the middle.

490
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,429
And then they bring him up.

491
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:29,041
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.

01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,211
Now, learning that you

819
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:41,998
were, in fact,
alive and well, and...

820
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:46,176
working for the CIA, well...

821
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:51,268
Well, that really was a blow.

822
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:54,227
Well,
they just asked so nicely.

823
01:06:56,273 --> 01:06:58,449
It's a shame that you
haven't lost your touch.

824
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:01,408
[sighs]
We wouldn't be in this mess.

825
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,194
This is your mess.

826
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,067
Blofeld tried to kill me
in Cuba,

827
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,938
but someone hijacked his plan.

828
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:13,029
And whoever stole your weapon

829
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,901
used it
to wipe out Spectre instead.

830
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:18,991
Now your weapon is on the run

831
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,776
and nobody seems
to know who has it.

832
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,648
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.

833
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:25,345
We're looking into it.

834
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:27,478
I can identify
the man that took Obruchev.

835
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:28,827
And what do you want
in return, Bond?

836
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:31,351
Blofeld.

837
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:33,788
Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.

838
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:36,269
Yes. He ran a Spectre meeting

839
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:38,489
in Cuba from Belmarsh.

840
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:40,143
-How?
-No.

841
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:42,971
How?
No one has access. No one.

842
01:07:43,015 --> 01:07:46,758
Why didn't you shut it down?

843
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:48,542
Why didn't you
shut Heracles down?

844
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:51,763
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.

845
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:55,027
-And to Felix Leiter?
-I certainly don't answer
to Felix Leiter.

846
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,942
Perhaps because he's dead.

847
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:05,081
I'm sorry.

848
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:08,562
I had a lot of respect
for Leiter.

849
01:08:09,607 --> 01:08:10,564
[sighs]

850
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:17,571
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.

851
01:08:17,615 --> 01:08:19,617
-Get me into Belmarsh.
-No.

852
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,185
Blofeld's the only member
of Spectre still breathing,

853
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:23,621
-I can't risk that.
-Oh, but you will

854
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:26,145
risk developing
a DNA-targeting weapon

855
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:29,148
with a corrupt scientist
for ten years?

856
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:31,324
There was nothing
to suggest that Obruchev

857
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:33,326
was working for anyone else.
I had him--

858
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:35,285
My God,
you're thirsty at the moment.

859
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:40,159
You have no right
to speak to me that way.

860
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:43,815
You have no right to make
insinuations about my judgment.

861
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:48,167
If you've nothing left
to give, you are irrelevant.

862
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:49,647
You've done your bit
and we thank you
for your service,

863
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:52,128
again. Goodbye.

864
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:56,610
-[beeps]
-Moneypenny, send in 007.

865
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:57,481
You can go, Bond.

866
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,533
It's definitely the same desk.

867
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:12,539
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

868
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,372
-[door closes]
-Go to Belmarsh.

869
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,983
I want everything
that Blofeld listens to,

870
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:24,160
looks at and touches scanned.

871
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,813
Scan every corner
of that cell.

872
01:09:25,857 --> 01:09:27,902
Scan the whole prison.

873
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:30,688
In fact,
scan the whole damn man.

874
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:33,169
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.

875
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:39,175
[Moneypenny] James...
Uh...

876
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:43,004
What are you doing for dinner?

877
01:09:47,748 --> 01:09:49,054
[doorbell rings]

878
01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:50,360

884
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:14,993
-So, you're not dead?
-Hello, Q. I've missed you.

885
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:18,518
[Moneypenny] Mm!
That smells great.

886
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:20,259
-Were you expecting somebody?
-[door closes]

887
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:22,783
Um... No. What...
Excuse me.

888
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:26,091
Oh.

889
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:29,747
This is the first time I've...
He'll be here in 20 minutes,

890
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,270
I can't take my focus off...

891
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:33,011
I need you to tell me
what's on that.

892
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:34,665
No, I need to lay the table.

893
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:36,536
[cat meows]

894
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,756
[soft operatic music playing
on speaker]

895
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:41,367
You know,
they come with fur these days.

896
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:44,762
I want to be very clear
that I am not authorized
to help you.

897
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:46,677
-And I have sworn...
-It's to do with Heracles.

898
01:10:49,897 --> 01:10:51,986
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.

899
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,685
No, but there's something
going on, Q.

900
01:10:54,728 --> 01:10:55,642
We need to find out
what it is.

901
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,996
[clicks tongue, sighs]

902
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,302
Well, it's never
9:00 to 5:00, is it?

903
01:11:04,825 --> 01:11:06,436
[Bond] Thank you.

904
01:11:11,745 --> 01:11:13,791
-Um, Bond?
-[Bond] Yes?

905
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,053
Do you know
where this has been?

906
01:11:15,096 --> 01:11:16,489
Everywhere, I should imagine.

907
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:18,926
[Q] Into the sandbox.

908
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:25,106
Oh. Thank you.

909
01:11:27,544 --> 01:11:29,589
-[Bond clears throat]
-[Q] Um, it's a database.

910
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:32,113
Don't touch that, please.

911
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:33,506
[Bond] What's the data?

912
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,726
[Q] It's DNA.
Multiple individuals.

913
01:11:35,769 --> 01:11:37,510
What was M working on?

914
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:39,251
Something he should have
shut down years ago.

915
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,209
-[Q] Oh, hello.
-[Bond] What?

916
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:43,386
[Q] There's more.
Hidden files.

917
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:46,606
I was asked to recover
what I could

918
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:49,261
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,

919
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,002
and I have
a pretty good feeling that...

920
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:54,875
this is what was missing.
Yeah. A complete disk.

921
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,405
So, Obruchev is working
for someone

922
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:03,928
who managed
to kill all of Spectre?

923
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:05,321
Not all of them.

924
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:08,193
[Moneypenny] Blofeld.

925
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:09,934
Can you show me
the other files?

926
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,239
[Q] Mm-hmm.

927
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:19,030
[Q] Wait,
this can't just be Spectre.

928
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:23,991
Oh, my God.
There are thousands.

929
01:12:25,819 --> 01:12:26,559
Who are they?

930
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:29,606
They're in categories.

931
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:31,651
I'm gonna need
more time to organize...

932
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:33,697
There have been, uh, breaches

933
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,134
round the world of databases
holding DNA information.

934
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,659
-We've been tracking them.
-Ours?

935
01:12:39,703 --> 01:12:41,008
I can't imagine
they're leaving us out,

936
01:12:41,052 --> 01:12:43,054
whoever they are.

937
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:45,317
Well, Blofeld
will know who they are.

938
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,405
Q, you need to get me
into Belmarsh.

939
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:52,106
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.

940
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,935
Who? M says no one has access.

941
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,807
-Really?
-Did he?

942
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,548
What's that?

943
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:00,419
[oven dings]

944
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:02,203
Can I just have
one nice evening, please,

945
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:03,335
before the world explodes?

946
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,555
Who has access? Who?

947
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:14,520
-[woman] Morning.
-[Madeleine] Morning.

948
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:17,349
[woman] New patient.
He's weird.

949
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,959
[Madeleine]
You can't say that.

950
01:13:25,052 --> 01:13:26,010
I'm sorry I'm late.

951
01:13:27,315 --> 01:13:28,839
[door closes]

952
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:30,406
I wasn't expecting
a new patient.

953
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:38,065
Sorry if I surprised you.

954
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:40,851
No. I like surprises.

955
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:47,901
[man] You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.

956
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:49,816
Must be dangerous
for your clients.

957
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:56,432
They are usually more
of a danger to themselves.

958
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:02,438
Foxgloves.

959
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,222
Beautiful.

960
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:07,399
-Did you choose them?
-Yes.

961
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,096
I found them friendly.

962
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,968
You know if you eat them

963
01:14:11,011 --> 01:14:13,057
they can cause your heart
to just...

964
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:17,061
stop.

965
01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:18,323
[chuckles softly]

966
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:20,151
Then I'll make sure not to.

967
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:29,247
Do you know a lot
about flowers?

968
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:32,119
My father had a garden.

969
01:14:32,163 --> 01:14:33,512
He taught me.

970
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:38,648
He died when I was young,
but my interest remained.

971
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:41,041
It's difficult
to lose a parent.

972
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:44,610
Especially at a young age.

973
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:47,439
Yes,

974
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,877
death has
a particular effect
on children,

975
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,271
doesn't it?

976
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,928
What effect
did it have on you?

977
01:14:58,798 --> 01:15:00,191
Profound.

978
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:02,715
But I saved a life once.

979
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:06,066
I think that had
more of an effect.

980
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:09,200
Why is that?

981
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:11,985
Saving someone's life

982
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:15,772
connects you
to them forever,
the same as taking it.

983
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:18,905
They belong to you.

984
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,347
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,

985
01:15:26,391 --> 01:15:28,524
so I brought a memory box.

986
01:15:32,005 --> 01:15:34,704
I thought
it might interest you.

987
01:15:34,747 --> 01:15:37,750
Sometimes objects
can be more evocative
than memories.

988
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:45,932
[breathing shakily]

989
01:15:49,762 --> 01:15:52,548
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.

990
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:56,247
They needed me.

991
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:01,687
It is a shock to see them
so many years later.

992
01:16:04,385 --> 01:16:05,343
They still need me.

993
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:09,173
I am rather taken by them.

994
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:11,131
-What do you want?
-Just a favor.

995
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,438
You owe me.

996
01:16:14,787 --> 01:16:16,615
You murdered my mother.

997
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:19,400
And your father
killed my entire family.

998
01:16:22,142 --> 01:16:24,188
Parents.

999
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:27,408
I need you to visit
someone for me,
wearing this.

1000
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:30,760
It's harmless to you.

1001
01:16:35,678 --> 01:16:37,593
You are the only one
who can do it.

1002
01:16:38,855 --> 01:16:39,769
No.

1003
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:43,163
Why would I do
anything for you?

1004
01:16:43,207 --> 01:16:49,561
Because I am a man
willing to kill
the person you love most.

1005
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,650
I've already lost everyone
I've ever loved.

1006
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:54,871
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.

1007
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,832
That is very sad to hear,
Madeleine.

1008
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:06,970
But it is not true...

1009
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:13,672
is it?

1010
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,335
[Bond]
Madeleine Swann, really?

1011
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:26,946
[M] Well, yes. We took
your information seriously,

1012
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:30,123
but that was five years ago.
Nothing came up.

1013
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,082
Well, she's very smart
and very good
at hiding things.

1014
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,474
She's a useful asset.

1015
01:17:33,518 --> 01:17:36,477
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.

1016
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:37,957
I had to exercise
my judgment...

1017
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:39,045
Your judgment is the problem.

1018
01:17:41,178 --> 01:17:43,571
That weapon was designed
to save lives

1019
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:45,878
and to eradicate
collateral damage
for our agents.

1020
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:49,708
A clean,
accurate shot every time.

1021
01:17:51,101 --> 01:17:52,668
But it had to be off the books.

1022
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,236
There are enough holes
in our national security.

1023
01:17:58,151 --> 01:17:59,979
[sighs] If the world knows
what this can do...

1024
01:18:00,023 --> 01:18:01,807
-They'd kill for it.
-Mm.

1025
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:03,853
Look...

1026
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:10,598
If it's an error,
it's on my shoulders,
fair and square.

1027
01:18:12,992 --> 01:18:14,820
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.

1028
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:19,085
I believe in defending
the principles of this...

1029
01:18:19,129 --> 01:18:20,521
Of this.

1030
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:25,004
But we used to be able to get
into a room with the enemy,

1031
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:25,918
we could look him in the eye.

1032
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,094
And now the...

1033
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,970
The enemy
is just floating in the ether.

1034
01:18:34,013 --> 01:18:34,927
We don't even know
what they're after.

1035
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:37,408
Blofeld.

1036
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:41,586
We managed to access
a database of their targets.

1037
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:42,718
"We"?

1038
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:46,112
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1039
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,767
I see.

1040
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,770
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?

1041
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:54,991
Well, it's hard to say.

1042
01:18:55,034 --> 01:18:56,601
I mean,
I would imagine world leaders,

1043
01:18:56,644 --> 01:18:59,778
innocent civilians, freedom,
you know, that sort of thing.

1044
01:18:59,822 --> 01:19:02,476
Oh, good,
well, just the usual.

1045
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,217
Just the usual.

1046
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:05,175
[chuckles]

1047
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:11,007
Blofeld was communicating
with his agents in Cuba

1048
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:14,619
through a bionic eye
which we've now retrieved.

1049
01:19:14,662 --> 01:19:17,187
You're welcome.

1050
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:21,278
Spectre's destruction's going
to have huge consequences.

1051
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:24,194
Whoever did this is going
to be very dangerous
and very powerful.

1052
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:29,416
We need all the information
that we can gather.

1053
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,678
Sir.

1054
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:32,768
[Tanner] Sir.

1055
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:36,859
Bond.

1056
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:39,644
So the rumors are true.
You look well.

1057
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:40,776
Tanner.

1058
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:43,474
Sir,
there's been a development.

1059
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:47,608
[Nomi] They were
just dropping,

1060
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:48,740
one right after the other.

1061
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,048
It was disturbing,
to say the least.

1062
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:54,528
Wait till you see
what it looks like up close.

1063
01:19:54,572 --> 01:19:57,444
-Uh, Bond's in the office.
-[Q] What?

1064
01:20:01,231 --> 01:20:04,756
Oh, Bond. My God,
I haven't seen you in,
in, uh...

1065
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,584
-How is your retirement?
-Shut up, Q.

1066
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,455
I know he's staying with you.

1067
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:10,240
And you're not
in the clear either.

1068
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:12,242
-What happened?
-He's been reinstated
as a double-0.

1069
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,855
-Double-0 what?
-What have you got?

1070
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:21,686
Q has studied
the blood samples I gathered

1071
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:23,470
from the victims
of the funeral.

1072
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:25,559
Just look at this.

1073
01:20:25,603 --> 01:20:27,605
-[typing]
-[M] What are we looking at?

1074
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,954
[Tanner] This is the funeral

1075
01:20:28,998 --> 01:20:31,565
of one of the dead
Spectre agents from Cuba.

1076
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:33,437
[Nomi] And here are
the members of their family

1077
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,570
who made physical contact
with the corpse.

1078
01:20:36,614 --> 01:20:39,008
We found Heracles
in the blood samples
of all of them.

1079
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:43,273
[M] Now,
that's some good work, Nomi.

1080
01:20:43,316 --> 01:20:45,275
Thank you, sir. Double-0 what?

1081
01:20:45,318 --> 01:20:48,626
-What are they?
-They're... They're nanobots.

1082
01:20:50,193 --> 01:20:51,629
Right.

1083
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:53,979
[Q] Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system

1084
01:20:54,023 --> 01:20:55,415
by the slightest contact
with your skin.

1085
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:05,121
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.

1086
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:07,863
Heracles was...

1087
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:13,738
It was designed to be
the most efficient weapon
in our arsenal.

1088
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,740
Passing through
people harmlessly

1089
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:18,090
before reaching
its intended target.

1090
01:21:18,134 --> 01:21:20,397
[Q] But Obruchev
modified the nanobots

1091
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,573
so that they can kill anyone
related to the target.

1092
01:21:22,616 --> 01:21:24,488
-Anyone?
-Well, since it's DNA-based,

1093
01:21:24,531 --> 01:21:25,924
with further modifications,
yes.

1094
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:30,102
Families,
certain genetic traits.

1095
01:21:30,146 --> 01:21:32,844
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms

1096
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,542
that could target a range
from individuals to...

1097
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:36,892
whole ethnicities.

1098
01:21:37,762 --> 01:21:39,329
You infect enough people...

1099
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:41,418
And the people
become the weapon.

1100
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:44,029
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.

1101
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:46,945
It was...

1102
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,297
I need to call
the Prime Minister.

1103
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:55,127
Tanner, quarantine
the families from the funeral.

1104
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:56,737
-Yes, sir.
-[M] And, Q,

1105
01:21:56,781 --> 01:21:58,739
hack into Blofeld's bionic eye,

1106
01:21:58,783 --> 01:21:59,915
see what you can find.

1107
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,266
-[door closes]
-You've got your wish.

1108
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:06,095
Go to Blofeld and see
what you can get out of him.

1109
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:08,097
And find
that cockroach Obruchev.

1110
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:10,055
Sir.

1111
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:16,235
We don't have a trail.

1112
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:19,673
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.

1113
01:22:19,717 --> 01:22:21,545
Find him,
you'll find Obruchev.

1114
01:22:21,588 --> 01:22:22,807
Um...

1115
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:25,462
Good luck.

1116
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:27,768
[chuckles] Thanks.

1117
01:22:44,307 --> 01:22:45,961
[water running]

1118

[Nomi clears throat]

1119
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:55,057
I'll be outside
when you're done

1120
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,623
with your important
preparation.

1121
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:00,627
I'll be just a moment.

1122
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:03,065
It's fine.

1123
01:23:22,736 --> 01:23:24,347
[automated voice]
Blofeld's eyeball unlocked.

1124

Accessing
received media stream.

1126
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:35,271
I know you
and she have a history,

1127
01:23:35,314 --> 01:23:38,491
but we've kept a close eye
on her over the years.

1128
01:23:38,535 --> 01:23:40,015
She's been very compliant.

1129
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:41,538
If Bond does
anything weird in there,

1130
01:23:41,581 --> 01:23:43,105
you'll be doing me
a huge favor,

1131
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:45,194
so don't make it too easy
for him, okay?

1132
01:23:45,237 --> 01:23:46,717
Okay.

He's the most valuable asset
this country has.

1134
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:51,635
I know you and he
have a history,

1135
01:23:51,678 --> 01:23:54,725
but don't let him get
in your head.

1136
01:23:54,768 --> 01:23:56,335
If you feel yourself
losing control...

1137
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:59,469
Oh, Tanner, relax.

1138
01:23:59,512 --> 01:24:00,818
I'm not gonna lose...

1139

control.

[clears throat]

1141
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,788
Dr. Swann, good afternoon.

[door buzzes open]

1143
01:24:20,533 --> 01:24:21,839
Mr. Bond.

1148
01:24:43,382 --> 01:24:45,776
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.

1149
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:47,125
Just get us a name.

1150

[door buzzes open]

1151
01:24:54,654 --> 01:24:58,136
Must be nice to catch up
with an old friend
so regularly.

1152
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:02,401
-We're closer than ever.

[sighs] Oh, that was awkward.

1154
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,752
Does he have that effect
on all women?

1155
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:08,103
[scoffs] Fifty-fifty.

1156
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:09,104
-It's unpredictable.
-Huh.

01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:27,513
It's not an ideal situation.

[door opens]

1163
01:25:57,717 --> 01:25:59,154
Open the door.

1164

Open the door!

1165
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:04,724
-Don't.
-What is it?

1166
01:26:06,248 --> 01:26:09,207
James,
you don't know what this is.

1167
01:26:10,469 --> 01:26:11,775
Don't make me do this.

1168
01:26:11,818 --> 01:26:13,690
Please.

1169
01:26:13,733 --> 01:26:14,908
Right. Open the doors.

-Open it.

Where are you going?

Home.

-[Nomi] I'll get her.
-[Tanner] Wait.

-He won't talk without her.
-Just wait.

Special delivery.

1178

James.

1179
01:26:54,557 --> 01:26:55,210
Hello, Blofeld.

1180
01:26:57,995 --> 01:27:00,432
Perhaps you can help me.

1181
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:04,697
Cuba was quite the party.

1182
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:07,483
-Happy birthday, by the way.
-Thank you.

1183
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:09,398
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.

1184
01:27:11,095 --> 01:27:13,228
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,

1185
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:15,665
with the world's
most powerful people,

1186
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:19,669
your friends, all in one room,
a noose around my neck,

1187
01:27:19,712 --> 01:27:22,237
and your hands on the most
valuable weapon in existence.

1188
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,110
It's like a...

1189
01:27:26,153 --> 01:27:29,766
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.

1190
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:34,205
A celebration of all
that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

1191
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,076
-[chuckles] Yeah, James.
-[chuckling]

1192
01:27:37,687 --> 01:27:39,776
Yeah.

1193
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:42,257
But then it all went wrong,
didn't it?

1194
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:47,523
My sweet James,
what do you want?

1195
01:27:47,566 --> 01:27:48,959
Your enemies
are closing in, Blofeld.

1196
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,484
And the biggest twist here

1197
01:27:52,528 --> 01:27:54,530
is that if you tell me
who they are,

1198
01:27:55,966 --> 01:27:57,576
I could save your life.

1199
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:00,753
Mm, my avenging angel.

My chaser of lost causes.

1201
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:06,281
Now you even chase mine.

1202
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:08,108
But you're asking
the wrong question.

1203
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:10,720
Yeah,
Cuba was a disappointment,

1204
01:28:10,763 --> 01:28:13,505
but we all cry on our birthday.

1205
01:28:13,549 --> 01:28:15,333
[over speaker]
You need to ask yourself,

1206
01:28:15,377 --> 01:28:17,814
why are we here?

A pleasure to meet you.

Oh, my God, that's him.

1216

[Ash] I am sorry
for your loss.

1217
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,550
I believe you know
who I represent and work for?

1218
01:28:58,594 --> 01:29:00,813
We have an opportunity for you.

[cell phone vibrating]

1220
01:29:02,032 --> 01:29:03,120
[Blofeld] You keep
coming back to me.

1221
01:29:03,163 --> 01:29:04,774
I thought
I'd never see you again,

1222
01:29:04,817 --> 01:29:06,297
but fate draws
us back together.

1223
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,560
Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash.

1224
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:10,954
-Go.
-Yep.

1225
01:29:10,997 --> 01:29:12,434
Let me know what happens.

1226
01:29:12,477 --> 01:29:13,913
[Blofeld] Now your enemy
is my enemy.

1227
01:29:13,957 --> 01:29:15,393
How did that happen?

1228
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:17,656
Well, you live long enough...

1229
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:20,311
-[laughs] Yeah. Look at us.
-[chuckles]

1230
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,791
Two old men in a hole

trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.

1232
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:30,452
She still loves you.
Did you know that?

1233
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:32,410
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.

1234
01:29:32,454 --> 01:29:34,194
She is irrelevant.

1235
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:37,720
Mm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.

1236
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:40,810
You said it yourself,
she's very good
at hiding things.

1237
01:29:40,853 --> 01:29:45,205
And when her secret
finds its way out,
and it will,

1238
01:29:45,249 --> 01:29:46,642
it'll be the death of you.

1239
01:29:46,685 --> 01:29:48,818
Just give me a name.

1240
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:50,646
-Madeleine.
-[scoffs]

1241

Please, just...
Please, no games.

01:29:55,172 --> 01:29:56,216
Madeleine.

1243
01:29:58,567 --> 01:30:01,134
Oh, do you know what?
The two of you
should come see me.

1244
01:30:01,178 --> 01:30:03,485
A little couples therapy.

1245
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:06,357
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.

1246
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,578
Just tell me
who they are, Blofeld...

1247
01:30:11,928 --> 01:30:14,278
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.

1248
01:30:14,321 --> 01:30:16,411
No, I don't want you to leave.

1249
01:30:16,454 --> 01:30:17,629
We're just getting
reacquainted.

1250
01:30:24,114 --> 01:30:25,811
Hmm. All right. Come.

1251
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:31,077
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something

1252
01:30:31,121 --> 01:30:33,428
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.

1253
01:30:39,956 --> 01:30:40,696
Careful, Bond.

1254
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:42,480
It was me.

1255
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:47,180
-You destroyed Spectre?
-[snorts] No.

Vesper's grave.

1257
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:51,315
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.

1258
01:30:51,358 --> 01:30:53,578
I knew you'd come visit it,

1259
01:30:53,622 --> 01:30:56,363
I just needed to wait
for the bon moment.

1260
01:30:56,407 --> 01:30:57,756
She led you straight there

1261
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,932
from the goodness
of her heart.

1262
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:02,935
And then you left her, for me.

1263
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:05,285
-It doesn't matter.
-Oh, but it does.

1264
01:31:05,329 --> 01:31:07,070
She still does, doesn't she?

1265
01:31:07,113 --> 01:31:09,289
My poor little cuckoo.

1266
01:31:10,769 --> 01:31:13,642
You were always so very,
very sensitive.

1267
01:31:17,123 --> 01:31:18,081
This isn't working.

1268
01:31:18,124 --> 01:31:19,474
Keep going.

1269
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:21,301
[Blofeld] All this wasted time,

1270
01:31:21,345 --> 01:31:23,434
the life you could have had.

1271
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,132
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful,

1272
01:31:26,176 --> 01:31:28,221
so exquisitely beautiful,

1273
01:31:28,265 --> 01:31:30,746
is that you're coming
to me looking for answers,

1274
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:33,792
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.

1275
01:31:33,836 --> 01:31:37,361
It's Madeleine. She holds
the secrets you need.

1276
01:31:37,404 --> 01:31:40,016
All of them.
I didn't need to kill you.

1277
01:31:40,059 --> 01:31:41,670
I'd already broken you.

1278
01:31:41,713 --> 01:31:43,759
I wanted to give you
an empty world...

1279
01:31:45,325 --> 01:31:47,589
like the one you gave me.

1280
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:49,373
It's enough
to almost make me regret it.

1281
01:31:50,766 --> 01:31:51,680
Eh, almost.

1282
01:32:00,297 --> 01:32:01,080
[softly] Die.

1283
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:03,648

What the hell
are you thinking?

1290

Yes, yes, yes, I know how
to interrogate an asset.

-This interrogation is over.
-Tanner, don't lecture me!

1292
01:32:26,062 --> 01:32:28,412
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule

1293
01:32:28,455 --> 01:32:29,935

Don't move.

01:32:47,997 --> 01:32:49,781
I'm... I'm gonna need those,
I'm afraid.

1297
01:33:01,837 --> 01:33:02,577
He's dead.

1298
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:07,451
It's a good thing
you're not actually related,

1299
01:33:07,494 --> 01:33:08,583
or you'd be dead too.

1300
01:33:10,236 --> 01:33:12,369
-How do I get this off?
-[Q] Oh, you don't. You can't.

is in your system,
it's there forever.

1303
01:33:27,297 --> 01:33:28,777
Did they find the car?

1304
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:30,822
We traced it,
but she abandoned it.

1305
01:33:30,866 --> 01:33:32,737
They searched her flat,
she hasn't been home.

1306
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:36,567
-Is she one of them?
-I don't know.

1307
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:40,397
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1308
01:33:42,268 --> 01:33:44,270
No. I don't know her at all.

1309
01:34:31,187 --> 01:34:32,579
[Madeleine] Is that for me?

1310
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:35,931
No.

1311
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:40,326
Then why did you come?

1312
01:34:41,588 --> 01:34:42,894
Because you told me to.

1313
01:34:44,766 --> 01:34:47,333
I didn't think you
would remember.

1314
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:49,292
I remember everything.

1315
01:34:49,335 --> 01:34:51,686
You need to tell me
who gave you
the poison, Madeleine.

1316
01:34:53,905 --> 01:34:54,906
Is he dead?

1317
01:34:56,299 --> 01:34:57,343
Yes, he's dead.

1318
01:34:58,475 --> 01:34:59,694
Good.

1319
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:03,872
He told me
you didn't betray me.

1320
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:07,876
I understand you're not built
to trust people.

1321
01:35:10,269 --> 01:35:13,185
-Neither are you.
-Then we were fools
for trying.

1322
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,710
I wanted to.

1323
01:35:22,934 --> 01:35:24,849
I don't know if you wanted me
to come here,

1324
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,331
or why you tried
to kill Blofeld,

1325
01:35:28,374 --> 01:35:29,811
or who gave you
the poison to do it,

1326
01:35:29,854 --> 01:35:30,986
or how long you've been
working for them,

1327
01:35:31,029 --> 01:35:32,378
but I do know...

1328
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:39,690
that for what felt
like five minutes of my life

1329
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,823
I wanted everything with you.

1330
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:46,741
And it's not
because I didn't trust.

1331
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,441
It was just that feeling.

1332
01:35:56,315 --> 01:35:58,753
I know I've come here
to find out who gave you
the poison.

1333
01:36:00,842 --> 01:36:02,757
But I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing

1334
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:05,977
that I have loved you,

1335
01:36:07,587 --> 01:36:09,589
and I will love you,

1336
01:36:09,633 --> 01:36:13,419
and I do not regret
a single moment of my life

1337
01:36:13,463 --> 01:36:14,551
that led me to you.

1338
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:19,251
Except when I put you
on that train.

1339
01:36:24,561 --> 01:36:25,780
Do you know
the worst thing about you?

1340
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,218
My timing?

1341
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:32,787
Don't.

1342
01:36:41,534 --> 01:36:43,580

1343
01:36:45,103 --> 01:36:45,974
Don't.

1344

-What?
-You look...

1345

Have we cleared this
with the Americans?

1355
01:37:42,769 --> 01:37:44,902
Granted.
And thank you for asking.

Well, your predecessor
was less deferential.

To be fair,
Commander Bond

To tell you everything.

1382
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:17,125
Blofeld ordered my father

01:39:17,168 --> 01:39:18,953
to assassinate this family.

1384

The boy survived.

1385
01:39:22,782 --> 01:39:23,958
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.

1386
01:39:28,658 --> 01:39:30,965
When I was a little girl,
he came here
to kill my father.

1387
01:39:33,184 --> 01:39:35,012
But he found me
and my mother instead.

1388
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:38,363
He spared my life.

1389

And now he's back.

-Revenge.

-Who were they?
-Spectre's poisoners.

1393
01:39:57,469 --> 01:39:59,515
My father held
a banquet for them,

1394
01:39:59,558 --> 01:40:02,170

1398
01:40:09,873 --> 01:40:11,048
The family had an island.

1399
01:40:12,919 --> 01:40:15,009
They called it
the Poison Garden.

1400

Oh, so...

1401

Blofeld took it from them,
and kept running it,

01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,800
and now this Safin
has taken it back.

So, you know, do your best.

to get there, a big one.

There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.

between Japan and Russia.

Some of these plants
are very dangerous,

are for hurting people.

You have me.

1610
01:58:31,756 --> 01:58:33,802
[Q] As soon as you have
a line of sight on the island,

1611
01:58:33,845 --> 01:58:35,543
drop altitude,
stay below radar.

1612
01:58:40,852 --> 01:58:42,115
You ever flown
one of these things before?

1613
01:58:43,638 --> 01:58:44,508
Nope.

1614
01:58:51,602 --> 01:58:53,430
[Q] Don't forget
to release the chute,

1615
01:58:53,474 --> 01:58:55,215
and open the wings.

1616
01:58:55,258 --> 01:58:56,172
Gravity isn't always
your friend.

1617
01:59:13,233 --> 01:59:15,191
Look for a concrete structure
on the west side
of the island.

1618
01:59:16,584 --> 01:59:17,846
That's your best bet
for getting in.

1620

[Nomi] Coming up for air, Q.

1621
02:00:06,764 --> 02:00:08,505
[Q] Right, good.

1622
02:00:08,549 --> 02:00:11,378
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.

1623
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:14,381
Doesn't seem
to get much activity,

1624
02:00:14,424 --> 02:00:15,773
but look out
for cameras anyway.

1625
02:00:17,035 --> 02:00:18,385
Use your watch, Bond.

Okay. Ah, there you go.

-Sir, they're in.
-Yes, we have it.

1634
02:01:05,867 --> 02:01:08,913
-He's the trident thingy.
-[Bond] Give us the layout.

1635
02:01:08,957 --> 02:01:11,568
Right. [clears throat]

1636
02:01:11,612 --> 02:01:15,224
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.

1637
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:18,096
The main activity should
be towards the central hub,

1638
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:19,272
which is directly above you.

1643
02:01:54,568 --> 02:01:56,178
Bond, there's something...

1644
02:01:56,221 --> 02:01:58,006
There's something
big up ahead,

1645
02:01:58,049 --> 02:01:59,355
I can't work out what it is.
It's...

Bond.

1649
02:02:11,062 --> 02:02:12,977
Bond? 007, do you read me?

1650
02:02:13,021 --> 02:02:15,371
[sighs] We've lost them.

1651
02:02:15,415 --> 02:02:17,199
They've entered
a blind spot, sir.

1652
02:02:17,242 --> 02:02:18,983
I can't work out what it is
they've walked into.

1653
02:02:19,027 --> 02:02:20,507
Well, just get them back.

[Bond] Well,
will you look at those doors.

1656
02:02:56,586 --> 02:02:58,109
This was a missile silo.

1657
02:02:58,153 --> 02:02:59,154
Right.

1658
02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:02,375

-[Bond] Move!

02:03:54,514 --> 02:03:56,603
You will never leave
this island alive.

1672
02:04:03,218 --> 02:04:04,132
[Nomi] That was the farm.

1673

Nomi, come and look at this.

Well, look,
you cannot stop it, mister.

1678
02:04:26,197 --> 02:04:28,504
We have big plan, you know.

1679
02:04:28,548 --> 02:04:30,071
-We have big numbers.
-What is it?

1680
02:04:30,114 --> 02:04:31,551
[Bond] It's a simulation.

1681
02:04:31,594 --> 02:04:33,291
They're not
just attacking individuals.

1682
02:04:33,335 --> 02:04:35,555
They're going to kill millions.

1683

It will not fit
in a suitcase this time, lady.

He's really getting
on my nerves.

1685
02:04:40,037 --> 02:04:40,864
Well, shut him up.

to destroy this whole facility.

Mr. Safin,
they use explosives.

-[Nomi] Shut up.
-[Safin] Mr. Bond,

you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.

Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?

Like adults.

Why do you think
he let you join him?

1707
02:05:56,549 --> 02:05:59,726
I think he wants you to drink.

I want him to give me
my daughter back.

you'll see her. Drink.

Do you know
what this flower does?

It makes you blind.

In love with Madeleine Swann.

1734
02:08:22,782 --> 02:08:24,914
I could be speaking
to my own reflection.

1735
02:08:24,958 --> 02:08:27,177
We've made
slightly different choices.

1736
02:08:27,221 --> 02:08:30,877
No. We've just developed
different methods
for the same goal.

1737
02:08:32,617 --> 02:08:35,533
Only your skills die
with your body.

1738
02:08:35,577 --> 02:08:38,972
Mine will survive
long after I'm gone.

1739
02:08:39,015 --> 02:08:41,975
And life is all about
leaving something behind.

1740
02:08:44,542 --> 02:08:45,369
Isn't it?

1741
02:08:47,067 --> 02:08:48,721
Doesn't have to be ugly.

1742
02:08:50,287 --> 02:08:52,768
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.

What do you think?

1744
02:08:57,381 --> 02:08:59,209
I think you're right.

1745
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:02,430
Thank you.

1746
02:09:02,473 --> 02:09:03,736
[Bond] I think we are the same.

1747
02:09:05,041 --> 02:09:06,739
We both know
what it feels like

1748
02:09:06,782 --> 02:09:09,045
to have everything
taken from us

1749
02:09:09,089 --> 02:09:12,048
before we're even
in the fight.

1750
02:09:12,092 --> 02:09:16,749
It would have been nice
to have a chance,

1751
02:09:16,792 --> 02:09:18,881
you know, don't you think?

1752
02:09:18,925 --> 02:09:21,928
Just...
we all should get a chance.

1753
02:09:21,971 --> 02:09:24,495
But this thing
that you're building,

1754
02:09:24,539 --> 02:09:26,759
it puts everyone,

1755
02:09:26,802 --> 02:09:29,457
the whole world
on a battlefield.

1756
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,328
Nobody gets a chance.

[exhales sharply]

1758
02:09:34,767 --> 02:09:38,118
The thing
that no one wants to admit

1759
02:09:38,161 --> 02:09:42,165
is that most people want things
to happen to them.

1760
02:09:42,209 --> 02:09:45,429
We tell each other lies
about the fight for free will

1761
02:09:45,473 --> 02:09:47,040
and independence,

1762
02:09:47,083 --> 02:09:50,652
but we don't really want that.

1763
02:09:50,695 --> 02:09:52,001
We want to be told how to live,

1764
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,700
and then die
when we are not looking.

1765
02:09:57,485 --> 02:10:00,053
People want oblivion,

1766
02:10:01,706 --> 02:10:04,840
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.

1767
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:10,890
So, here I am,
their invisible god...

1768
02:10:12,935 --> 02:10:16,852
[whispers]
sneaking under their skin.

1769
02:10:16,896 --> 02:10:19,333
You know that history
isn't kind
to those who play God.

1770
02:10:19,376 --> 02:10:20,290
And you don't?

1771
02:10:22,466 --> 02:10:27,558
We both eradicate people
to make the world
a better place.

1772
02:10:27,602 --> 02:10:32,476
I just want to be
a little... tidier.

1773
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:35,610
Without collateral.

1774
02:10:35,653 --> 02:10:38,091
I want the world to evolve,

1775
02:10:38,134 --> 02:10:39,875
yet you want it
to stay the same.

1776
02:10:41,311 --> 02:10:42,095
Let's face it...

1777
02:10:45,968 --> 02:10:49,537
-I've made you redundant.
-[Bond] No.

1778
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:51,408
Not as long
as there are people
like you in the world.

1779
02:10:53,584 --> 02:10:56,936
And with all due respect
to the enormity of your...

1780
02:10:58,067 --> 02:10:59,242
tidy achievements,

1781
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:03,464
all you're really doing is
standing in a very long line

1782
02:11:03,507 --> 02:11:05,727
of angry little men.

1783
02:11:05,770 --> 02:11:09,513
I'm not angry,
just passionate.

1784
02:11:11,385 --> 02:11:14,301
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,

1785
02:11:14,344 --> 02:11:17,652
and you can take this precious
little angel with you.

1786
02:11:19,567 --> 02:11:20,133
And Madeleine?

1787
02:11:22,526 --> 02:11:24,920
-She stays.
-You know I can't do that.

1788
02:11:26,139 --> 02:11:27,792
[sighs] That is a shame.

1789
02:11:29,533 --> 02:11:31,057
She really hoped you would.

1790
02:11:32,188 --> 02:11:34,364
She knows
it's her only path to survive.

1791
02:11:34,408 --> 02:11:37,411
No, you have her tell me that.

1792
02:11:37,454 --> 02:11:41,154
What mother wouldn't sacrifice
herself for her own child?

1793
02:11:43,983 --> 02:11:45,071
Is that what happened to yours?

1794
02:11:51,468 --> 02:11:53,949
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.

1795
02:11:57,997 --> 02:11:59,128
Wait! Wait. Wait.

1796
02:12:03,828 --> 02:12:04,960
I'll do whatever you want.

1797
02:12:05,004 --> 02:12:06,005
Yes, you will.

1798
02:12:09,573 --> 02:12:11,097
I... I apologize.

1799
02:12:14,404 --> 02:12:15,753
I'm sorry.

1800
02:12:16,711 --> 02:12:18,495
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.

1801
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:22,064
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?

1802
02:12:24,545 --> 02:12:26,199
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?

1803
02:12:26,242 --> 02:12:28,027
No. No. No. No. No.

1804
02:12:30,594 --> 02:12:31,944
I am sorry.

1805
02:12:33,858 --> 02:12:35,121
I'm sorry.

1806
02:12:37,123 --> 02:12:38,385
[whispers]
Look at your father, Mathilde.

1807
02:12:42,476 --> 02:12:43,564
This is power.

1808
02:12:43,607 --> 02:12:44,652
[Bond] I'm sorry.

1809
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:48,221
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1810

Hmm...

1821

If you don't want
my protection, then...

1822
02:13:35,790 --> 02:13:37,009
off you go.

[sighs]

1824
02:13:47,497 --> 02:13:50,022
Move.
Our first buyers are arriving.

1825
02:14:03,557 --> 02:14:06,864
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.

1826
02:14:06,908 --> 02:14:09,476
Several high-speed transports
are headed towards the island.

1827
02:14:09,519 --> 02:14:10,825
Origin unknown.

1828
02:14:10,868 --> 02:14:11,695
Still no sign of 007.

1829
02:14:14,307 --> 02:14:17,353
Come on, Bond.
Where the hell are you?

1830
02:14:17,397 --> 02:14:20,791
This is hopeless situation,
lady. Please.

[indistinct announcement on PA]

-[alarm blaring]
-Bond.

1834
02:14:27,929 --> 02:14:30,279
The party is larger
than the reservation.

1835
02:14:30,323 --> 02:14:33,369
Look, lady,
please, please just let me go.

1836
02:14:33,413 --> 02:14:36,111
I... There was never
gonna be a way out.

1837
02:14:37,591 --> 02:14:38,679
Stop this nonsense.

1838
02:14:38,722 --> 02:14:40,811
You don't have a chance,
anyways.

1840

Hey. Hey, I have a good vial
for your people,

It can be a good thing.

I do not need laboratory

-Do you know what time it is?
-What?

1846
02:15:14,454 --> 02:15:16,151
Time to die.

They dropped down

There has to be

1856
02:16:04,373 --> 02:16:05,592
[in English] We should go.

It's Q. Do you read me?

1859
02:16:17,517 --> 02:16:19,649
[man on radio]
Traffic. We have traffic.

1860
02:16:19,693 --> 02:16:22,304
-I think we just got buzzed.
-Those are two Russian MiGs.

1861
02:16:22,348 --> 02:16:24,045
Traffic. TCAS,
you have control.

1862
02:16:24,088 --> 02:16:25,612
I understand, and I'm doing
the best that I can.

1863
02:16:25,655 --> 02:16:27,788
Just please wait.

1864
02:16:27,831 --> 02:16:30,007

Yes. Bond.

1878
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:17,533
Do we have
any Royal Naval vessels

-in the immediate vicinity?
-Uh, yes. Why?

1880
02:17:21,015 --> 02:17:22,843
We are gonna need
an immediate strike
on this location.

1881
02:17:22,886 --> 02:17:24,932
This whole island,

1882

it's a manufacturing plant
for Heracles.

1883

We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?

02:17:29,763 --> 02:17:31,678
Mm-mm.

else you should know.

Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.

Our operation
is attracting a lot
of international attention.

We're seeing what we can do.

[Bond] Come on.

1894

Let's go. Come on.

1900
02:18:32,565 --> 02:18:33,479
I'll just be a minute.

02:18:43,532 --> 02:18:44,490
This might come in handy.

Thank you.

[Q] Um, our uninvited guests
are 15 minutes away.

1908
02:19:15,651 --> 02:19:19,960
[M] Bond, M here. The situation
is diplomatically complex.

1909
02:19:20,003 --> 02:19:23,093
We don't have a choice.
Fire on my mark.

1910
02:19:23,137 --> 02:19:25,574
[M] If we launch,
the Russians, the Japanese

1911
02:19:25,618 --> 02:19:27,533
and even the Americans
will want answers.

1912
02:19:27,576 --> 02:19:28,621
Well, don't give them any.

1913
02:19:31,928 --> 02:19:34,191
[M] Rational minds, Bond.

1914
02:19:34,235 --> 02:19:35,932
I'm trying to save this from
escalating to all-out war.

1915
02:19:37,804 --> 02:19:40,633
Mallory, if we don't do this,

1916
02:19:40,676 --> 02:19:41,808
there will be nothing
left to save.

1917

there's another problem.

-That room you were just in.
-Yes, I know, I know.

1920
02:19:49,946 --> 02:19:51,600
I've got
to open the blast doors.

1921
02:19:51,644 --> 02:19:53,167
Otherwise our missiles
will bounce off it

1922
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:55,169
like they've hit a trampoline.

1923
02:19:55,212 --> 02:19:56,431
Yes, I know, I know.

1924
02:19:58,302 --> 02:20:00,392
[Q] Find the control room.
It should be in a tower

1925
02:20:00,435 --> 02:20:02,437
just above the blast doors.

1926
02:20:02,481 --> 02:20:05,135
The missiles will take about
nine minutes from launch.

1927
02:20:05,179 --> 02:20:06,789
Do you think you can do it
before the ships arrive?

I read you.

1946
02:23:34,344 --> 02:23:36,085
Sounds like
you're in a rugby scrum.

1947
02:23:36,129 --> 02:23:37,609

Right, good.
Now, did you find
the control room?

1950
02:23:48,271 --> 02:23:50,796
Well, my Russian
is a little rusty,
but I think so, yeah.

02:24:04,548 --> 02:24:06,333
Okay, Q.

02:24:06,376 --> 02:24:08,248

-Power?
-[alarm blaring]

1958
02:24:21,391 --> 02:24:23,176
Right, the infrastructure
must go back to the 1950s,

1959
02:24:23,219 --> 02:24:24,612
so it's going to be
an overly complicated

02:24:24,656 --> 02:24:26,658
and intricate
switching system.

1961
02:24:26,701 --> 02:24:29,704
Now, the order
in which you engage it

1962
02:24:29,748 --> 02:24:31,140
will need to be
extremely precise.

1963
02:24:31,184 --> 02:24:34,187
You're looking
for a control panel.

1964
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:37,451
There should be
a counterweight clutch.

1965
02:24:37,494 --> 02:24:39,148
So, listen very carefully, 007.

The first thing
you need to do...

Okay. Okay, okay.

M, Bond says fire.
