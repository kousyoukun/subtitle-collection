1
00:00:58,116 --> 00:00:59,534
Madeleine?

2
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:03,246
You want to eat again?

3
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:07,041
You eat too much
because you're depressed.

4
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:10,670
Madeleine!

5
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:12,797
Yes?

6
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,676
Madeleine!

7
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,052
Yes, mama?

8
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,305
I'm thirsty, my angel.

9
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:21,556
I'm coming.

10
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:25,351
- Do you want your medicine?
- Yes, my darling.

11
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:33,943
Do you want to play a game?

12
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:37,572
I'm waiting for Papa to come home.

13
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,119
What do you think Papa does?

14
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,079
He's a doctor.

15
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,124
He heals people.

16
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:50,043
Oh. No, no.

17
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:53,171
Your Papa, he kills people.

18
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:57,467
- No.
- Is that who you love? Murderers?

19
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:32,335
Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama!

20
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,003
Leave me be. Go play.

21
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,422
Mama!

22
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:37,507
Leave me alone!

23
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:02,782
Mama!

24
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,762
- Hello.
- Let the sheep out, kid.

25
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:26,348
- Why?
- Because otherwise I'll kill you.

26
01:38:05,062 --> 01:38:06,647
If you hear anything what do you do?

27
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:09,441
I hide.

28
01:38:10,567 --> 01:38:11,819
Very good.

29
01:38:14,613 --> 01:38:16,073
- Good night.
- Good night.

30
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:18,534
- Say good night.
- Good night.

31
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:20,953
Good night.

32
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:18,338
I'm hungry.

33
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:46,867
Not bad.

34
01:43:04,528 --> 01:43:05,654
Where are we going?

35
01:43:06,571 --> 01:43:08,657
We're going on an adventure, darling.
Hang on.

36
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:23,964
Mama.

37
01:43:25,048 --> 01:43:26,383
A mosquito bite me.

38
01:43:27,217 --> 01:43:28,135
It's okay.

39
01:43:28,218 --> 01:43:30,637
Dou Dou, do you like mosquitoes?

40
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:51,992
Mama.

41
01:43:52,075 --> 01:43:55,662
- Do mosquitoes have friends?
- I don't know.

42
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:01,334
I don't think so.

43
01:44:16,975 --> 01:44:18,101
Hang on.

44
01:56:36,130 --> 01:56:39,217
Remember what I told you.
Don't touch anything. Okay?

45
01:58:11,517 --> 01:58:14,937
Remember what I told you.
I'll come looking for you. Okay?

46
02:00:29,321 --> 02:00:31,574
- What's going on?
- It's the equipment.

47
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:33,617
The cameras are down.

48
02:00:34,535 --> 02:00:35,745
The whole lower sector.

49
02:00:35,828 --> 02:00:38,122
I'll restart the system.

50
02:13:10,540 --> 02:13:11,583
My Dou Dou.

51
02:15:42,984 --> 02:15:44,527
I lost my little Dou Dou.

52
02:15:52,702 --> 02:15:56,039
I looked for you all over.
Where were you?

53
02:15:56,122 --> 02:15:58,333
I hid like you told me.

54
02:16:00,418 --> 02:16:01,920
I love you.

55
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:04,214
Me too. I love you.
