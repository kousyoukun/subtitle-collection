1
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,889
<i>What is a ghost?</i>

2
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:59,352
<i>A tragedy doomed
to repeat itself time and again?</i>

3
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:17,162
<i>An instant of pain, perhaps.</i>

4
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,424
<i>Something dead
which still seems to be alive.</i>

5
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:42,688
<i>An emotion, suspended in</i> time.

6
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:49,694
<i>Like a blurred photograph.</i>

7
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,123
<i>Like an insect trapped in amber.</i>

8
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:51,399
THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE

9
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:09,042
We'll be there soon.

10
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,354
What the…

11
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:31,124
It fell quite a while ago,
but it never went off.

12
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,543
Bomb squad came,

13
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,586
defused it…

14
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,923
and just left it there.
Stuck. No one can move it.

15
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,349
Follow me, please.

16
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,604
Carlos…

17
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,940
wait right here.
We won't be long.

18
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:00,111
Who are those guys outside?

19
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,947
The caretaker
and two men who help him.

20
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:08,328
They're from the town nearby.
There's always work to be done.

21
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,122
They're building a chicken coop now.

22
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,217
What's going on out there?

23
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,639
- They're here.
- Ayala and Dominguez, again?

24
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,893
Yes. And Ayala's wounded.

25
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,189
They're always in trouble.

26
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:40,318
They've brought another boy.

27
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:50,203
As if we didn't
have enough already.

28
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,876
Let's go.

29
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,417
You just arrived?

30
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:24,130
Got any candy?
Maybe a bit of bread?

31
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:29,093
I'm Gálvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he stares a lot.

32
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,096
I'm Carlos.

33
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,519
Got any fruit, even if it's soft?

34
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:41,272
No, but I've got
some comics and toys.

35
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,274
- Want to see them?
- Yeah.

36
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:46,736
<i>I can't do it.</i>

37
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,071
I can't take another boy.

38
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:52,158
I can barely feed the ones
we have. I'm sorry.

39
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,288
He's the son of a comrade
fallen at the front.

40
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:01,376
- The boy doesn't know.
- He doesn't know.

41
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,087
Your husband was a brave man,
a true Leftist.

42
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,798
Oh, no.
I'm the brave one.

43
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,301
Ricardo was a man of books
and ideals.

44
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,347
But he decided to die and leave me
to defend them.

45
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:19,436
The Nationalists will arrive any day
and what will they find?

46
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,939
Reds looking after Reds' children.

47
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,815
Not to mention this!

48
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,778
I can't keep it anymore.
If you want to leave the boy…

49
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,947
take the rest of the gold.

50
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,491
There are 10 ingots left.

51
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,409
At least you can buy guns.

52
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:38,246
I can't even buy bread with it.

53
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:41,082
- Take it away.
- We can't.

54
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:44,001
- We're crossing enemy lines.
- Your decision:

55
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,088
The boy goes hungry here
or gets killed out there.

56
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,345
Class time!
Come on!

57
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,478
Look, Owl, a comic book!

58
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,190
<i>I'll</i> swap you.

59
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,278
Look at this marble.
It's my favorite. It came from China.

60
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,739
Or look at this one.

61
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,825
Owl made it himself.

62
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:19,078
Hard snot and mud.
Six months of snot.

63
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,332
Hey, you! That's mine!

64
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,543
- Are you here to stay?
- No.

65
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,129
Then why are you here?

66
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,090
I came with Mr. Ayala, my tutor.

67
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:36,471
- What's the fuck's a tutor?
- He looks after me while my father's away.

68
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,014
Shit, that's fancy!

69
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,349
No one here has a tutor.

70
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,644
You want it back?
Take it.

71
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:45,605
Take it away.
C'mon.

72
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,405
Carlos, look!

73
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,909
Mr. Ayala.

74
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,248
Your tutor's leaving you, faggot!

75
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,659
Stay with him for a while.

76
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,662
He seems quite meek.

77
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,289
So, I'm sure you'll get along.

78
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,183
We'll have to fix this.

79
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,895
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo.</i>

80
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,566
Has Edmond Dantés
broken out of prison yet?

81
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,403
- Has he met Abbot Faria?
- They're digging a tunnel.

82
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:19,156
- Do they manage to escape?
- Mmh. I don't know.

83
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,617
Why don't you read on,
and then tell me?

84
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:28,332
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with thick glasses is Alma.

85
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,960
She teaches math and reading.

86
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,422
And the distinguished lady you saw,
remember?

87
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,007
Her name is Carmen.

88
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,010
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No. She's the headmistress.

89
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,178
Why did they leave me behind?

90
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,765
Why can't I be with my father?

91
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:46,476
Carlitos…

92
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,770
you're staying with us
for a while…

93
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,354
Just for a while.

94
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,606
So be patient.

95
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,864
Your soap bar has to
last you all year long.

96
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,950
Don't lose it…

97
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,911
or you'll get punished:
two weeks of extra tasks.

98
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,875
You can play in the yard,
but never inside the building.

99
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,727
This is your bed.

100
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,395
Number 12.

101
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,650
Why are there so many empty beds?

102
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,819
Some boys run away,
but I wouldn't advise it.

103
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,739
It's a day's walk to town.

104
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,991
The nights are cold
and the days -

105
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,502
For your locker.

106
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,671
Do you understand?

107
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,175
There are no bars here.
This isn't a prison.

108
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,446
See where they put the new kid?

109
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,118
- In Santi's bed.
- Shut up!

110
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,712
The Pig and I think that
even if you complain a lot…

111
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,881
you're all cozy here.

112
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,968
Far away from the war,
well hidden.

113
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,470
Well looked after.

114
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,681
- What could be better?
- Granada.

115
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,643
Going to Granada?

116
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,562
Yes. We're getting married.

117
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,274
We'll buy a small farm.

118
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,611
Sure.

119
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,654
Granada!

120
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,951
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?

121
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,162
I don't need anyone.

122
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,333
I've managed fine so far,
all on my own.

123
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,501
Right.

124
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,919
Without parents.

125
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:25,009
Those Reds we saw,
they were here for the gold.

126
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,594
That's right, the school's gold.

127
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,888
That's why they dine so well here…
All that gold!!

128
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:33,684
You don't believe me now,
but <i>I'll</i> show you.

129
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,604
<i>I'll</i> try these two tonight
and let you know what happens.

130
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,940
That's great, kid.

131
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,734
Got a smoke?

132
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,570
- No.
- All right, so long.

133
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,791
I don't like those two.

134
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,004
They make me sick.

135
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,174
This place makes me uneasy.

136
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,556
When I was a kid…

137
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,766
I'd stand here…

138
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,643
in the middle of the yard…

139
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,897
and I'd look up at the sky.

140
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,901
I dreamed
of getting out of here.

141
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,153
I prayed to become rich…

142
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,905
so I could buy this dump
and I could tear it all down.

143
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,159
Forget it now.

144
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,669
No. I don't want anyone to know
I spent 15 years here.

145
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,840
Well, I'm glad you came back.

146
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,935
Let's go to my room.
It's getting chilly.

147
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:03,417
San… ti…

148
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,030
Who are you?

149
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,527
What are you doing?

150
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,822
- Me? Nothing.
- What the hell's going on?

151
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,784
The fucking new kid
dumped the water.

152
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,709
Come here.

153
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,670
You'll have to fetch some more
from the kitchen.

154
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,797
Isn't that off limits?

155
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,217
No one's ever been caught.

156
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,302
What about the “one who sighs”?

157
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,639
So. What's it to be?
Are you going or not?

158
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,808
Who's the “one who sighs”?

159
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,522
- You're a chickenshit.
- No, I'm not.

160
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,900
You're a shit, a queer.

161
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,985
All right, <i>I'll</i> go.

162
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,572
But you're coming with me.

163
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,991
We'll each fill a jug.

164
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,286
But if you're scared -

165
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,563
They all say she's switched off.

166
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,566
But I don't believe it.

167
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,698
Put your ear against her,
you can hear her ticking.

168
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,538
That's her heart.

169
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,874
She's still alive.

170
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,877
And she knows we're here.

171
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,590
Hide!

172
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,742
That one.

173
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:34,813
C'mon.

174
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,438
See you outside.

175
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:28,719
“No one's ever been caught.”
Bastard.

176
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,812
Shit!

177
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,158
Hello.

178
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,483
Who are you?

179
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,862
Do you live down here?

180
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:54,585
<i>Many of you will die.</i>

181
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,567
Jaime!

182
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,650
What are you up to?

183
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:58,000
“Out, out, yearnings of mine.
Let not respect bind you.

184
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:01,337
It flatters pity -

185
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:05,467
It flatters pity
not to be able to hide.

186
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,472
Let your lips bear witness…

187
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,891
to the blaze in your heart.

188
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,769
No one will believe the fire
if the smoke sends no signals.

189
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:20,190
He who cares for his well-being
keeps not his feelings silent.

190
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:25,361
My grief is greater than I.

191
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,280
And that being so…

192
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,449
it will be easier…

193
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,745
it will be easier…

194
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,789
for it to defeat me…

195
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,376
than for me to command it.

196
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,798
Consideration does not suffice
to prevent the cry.

197
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,969
He is not a brave prisoner
who dares not break down his jail.”

198
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,164
A grain of strength.

199
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:33,930
Carlos, are you going to tell me
who was with you last night?

200
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,978
He's not going to tell.

201
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,108
He'll squeal in the end.
Wait and see.

202
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,401
Do you understand me?

203
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:51,781
Then, for the last time…

204
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:55,451
who was with you last night?

205
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,662
I was alone.

206
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,376
That kid won't crack.

207
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:06,170
But, if we want to know
who was with him, tell me:

208
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:11,384
- What's for breakfast?
- Milk and bread.

209
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,219
Perfect.

210
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:16,639
Very well.
You may begin.

211
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:26,941
They think Carlos has confessed,
but they don't care.

212
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:30,402
They're so hungry.
Look, they're ravenous.

213
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:35,867
But those who look up
from their plate are his accomplices.

214
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,414
Marcos, Gálvez, Jaime and Owl.

215
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,249
Come here.

216
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,630
I knew you wouldn't squeal.

217
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,966
Dr. Casares tricked me.

218
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,260
That's what I thought.

219
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,931
It isn't because of you
that we are being punished.

220
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:01,893
- Dr. Casares is real smart.
- He sure is!

221
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,189
Careful.

222
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,859
Come on, Owl.

223
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:15,114
Shit, for a dead guy,
he sure weighs a shitload!

224
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,703
Well, well!

225
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:24,040
Christ in the yard
and John the Baptist in here.

226
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,667
Are things that bad?

227
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:31,005
If the new Spain
is Catholic and apostolic -

228
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,218
Try it now.

229
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,728
I told you.

230
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:48,564
- Dance with me.
- No.

231
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:51,818
- Come on, dance with me.
- No.

232
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,654
I can't dance.

233
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,830
You heard Ayala.

234
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,999
Catalonia is about to fall.

235
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:11,087
Then Madrid will follow, and then -

236
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,009
The kids talk of a ghost.
Have you heard them?

237
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,012
Yes.

238
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:22,766
Sometimes I think
that we are the ghosts.

239
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,434
<i>Gálvez…</i>

240
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:27,687
last night, you didn't shoot at me.

241
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,814
That's right.

242
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,111
- Wow, that's amazing!
- It's for you.

243
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,494
Why are they laughing?

244
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,332
Assholes.

245
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:55,965
Go back to Argentina,
while you still can.

246
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,467
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.

247
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:02,638
England or France
might still intervene.

248
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,809
That's wishful thinking.

249
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,229
- You're just like Ricardo.
- No.

250
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,148
No, I'm not like him.

251
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:15,443
Twenty years ago,
I found my place in the world.

252
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,157
And I stayed.

253
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,785
That's all.

254
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,246
Look at it jump!

255
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,629
Where's the new kid?

256
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:48,518
Are you the “one who sighs”?

257
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:53,481
Do you live down there?

258
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,861
Listen.

259
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:10,789
What are you up to?
Go on, call Dr. Casares.

260
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,708
Ass-kisser!

261
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,922
Throw him down!
Go on!

262
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,555
He can't swim!

263
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:48,411
- Over there!
- Over there, to your left!

264
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,396
There he is!

265
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,108
Grab him! Careful!

266
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,754
What's going on?

267
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:43,466
What have I told you?

268
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,801
And you, eh?

269
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:48,805
What the fuck
are you doing down here?

270
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:54,685
Whose is this?

271
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,646
It's mine.

272
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:04,946
If anything happens to you,
I get the blame.

273
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:11,452
Get out!

274
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,457
Out!

275
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:27,135
A single word about this
and <i>I'll</i> rip you in half.

276
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:29,011
Got that?

277
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,817
There you go.

278
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,695
Our Carlos has been here
five minutes

279
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,197
and he's gotten into trouble already.

280
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:51,576
<i>Have you read any more
of Monte Cristo?</i>

281
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,662
Do you believe in ghosts?

282
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,789
Why? There aren't any in that novel.

283
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:03,045
I think I saw one… here.

284
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,591
Carlos, as you can see,

285
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,720
I'm a man of science.

286
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:14,265
But Spain is full of superstition.
Come here.

287
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:17,977
Europe is sick with fear now,
and fear sickens the soul.

288
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,938
And that, in turn,
makes us see things.

289
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,898
In town…

290
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:25,526
they call this…

291
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:28,738
“the devil's backbone.”

292
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,448
They say a lot of things.

293
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,492
That this happens to children
who “shouldn't have been born”.

294
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,245
“Nobody's children.”
But that's a lie.

295
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:39,582
Poverty and disease.
That's all it is.

296
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:44,253
The liquid they are pickled in
is called “limbo water.”

297
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:48,090
In the old days, it was
made with various spices…

298
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,884
cloves, rum.

299
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:54,763
So this is very, very old rum.

300
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:59,268
I sell it in town, and the money
keeps the school going.

301
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:01,062
Do they drink it?

302
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:05,358
They say it helps to cure blindness,
kidney ailments…

303
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,110
and also, apparently…

304
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,028
impotence.

305
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,031
Rubbish, but you know,

306
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:15,784
after 60, men will pay
anything just to -

307
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,453
You know.

308
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:21,623
So if you're going to believe
in ghosts and all that rubbish,

309
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:26,253
you should have a sip of this
to heal your wound.

310
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:30,383
No. I'm not really sure I saw a ghost.
Can I go now?

311
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,968
Yes, of course.

312
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,513
And watch it!

313
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,879
Calm down.

314
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,965
I'm not going to punch you.

315
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,592
Be quiet.

316
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,094
Carlos…

317
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:18,931
get out your comics
so we can read them.

318
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:31,735
- That ring's pretty.
- It's from a cigar.

319
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:35,406
I found it four summers ago.
It's very pretty.

320
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,200
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.

321
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,204
Look.

322
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:44,999
A naked woman.
It's really well drawn, just like a photo.

323
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:48,586
She's a cutie!
Who drew this?

324
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,338
Her pussy's sideways.

325
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:55,301
- It looks like a mouth.
- What would you know, you fucking midget.

326
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:59,013
Look, a slice of fig cake.

327
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:01,974
It's a bit mushed
but it's still okay.

328
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:05,602
No, give me back my comic.
I want it back.

329
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:07,855
Fine.

330
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:11,651
I'll give it to you later.
It's in my locker.

331
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:16,238
You're a real artist.

332
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:18,449
When I grow up,
I want to draw comics.

333
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:21,452
- Like mine?
- No, much better.

334
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:23,537
With more fights and treasures.

335
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:25,873
And big ships
with lots of cannons.

336
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:28,584
These bugs are icky.
What do they eat?

337
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,380
Did you hear that?

338
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:35,632
A sigh.

339
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,926
I didn't hear it.

340
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,596
I heard it too.

341
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,834
Don't kiss me.

342
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,881
Sorry, I forgot.

343
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,929
This is the last time.

344
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:26,141
Sure. “The last time.”

345
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,227
Same old story.

346
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:43,117
Don't make any noise.

347
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:45,953
Scared the old man will hear?

348
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,080
I've never been scared.

349
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,334
Just ashamed.

350
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,169
Yeah.

351
00:45:57,047 --> 00:46:00,342
You're ashamed of me.
Not him.

352
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,803
Oh, he's a gentleman.

353
00:46:04,346 --> 00:46:07,015
Pity that's not enough.

354
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,315
You need a hard cock as well.

355
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:17,109
And your husband and the doctor -

356
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,070
Tough luck.

357
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:30,163
The old man stares at you.
He loves you.

358
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:33,292
He loved you even back when
your husband was still alive.

359
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:35,211
I was 17.

360
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:38,214
They both took care of the poetry,

361
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,883
I took care of the flesh.

362
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:47,055
This leg -

363
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:51,477
I don't like
to think about this leg.

364
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:55,064
It hurts.

365
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:59,485
Some days I can't bear it.

366
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:03,989
But I need it
to stay on my feet.

367
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,784
<i>I saw those lights again today
in the sky.</i>

368
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,952
That's the war.
<i>It'll</i> never end.

369
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,913
The war's shit.

370
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,040
Well, I like it.

371
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,666
You like it, dickhead?

372
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,878
Yeah, because you see
the planes going like this…

373
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,132
My mother says

374
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:06,468
that the earth's so dry here
and the air's so hot

375
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:09,680
that the dead get stuck
halfway to heaven.

376
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:13,141
- That's rubbish!
- Just like the “one who sighs.”

377
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:17,605
Here you go again, you fucking moron!

378
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:25,654
Even if it annoys him,
there is a ghost.

379
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:29,366
The day the bomb fell,
a boy disappeared. Santi.

380
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:32,244
Since then,
no one has dared take Jaime on.

381
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:34,622
Yeah. Santi slept in your bed,
number 12.

382
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:36,916
Shit, I'm telling the story here.

383
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,544
The teachers think
that when the bomb fell…

384
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:43,255
Santi got scared and ran away.

385
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:46,550
But maybe some shepherds
found him and he's alive.

386
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:49,302
Or cutthroats got him
and drained his blood.

387
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:50,596
Yeah.

388
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,391
They sell the blood to rich people
to cure their tuberculosis.

389
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,560
And where's the ghost?

390
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,603
Well, It came with the bomb.

391
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:01,148
So, maybe if you ask her -

392
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:33,055
Take that one.

393
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:41,521
Out of the way.

394
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:53,242
Put those in, but be careful!

395
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:56,036
Don't break them.

396
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:33,198
Miss.

397
00:50:35,826 --> 00:50:37,786
Look, I found this.

398
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:40,831
I thought you might like it.

399
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,959
Open the gate, Jaime.

400
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:48,422
It's beautiful.

401
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:53,385
It looks like real gold,
but it isn't.

402
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,513
Looks real to me.

403
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:00,058
It's lovely.

404
00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:01,685
Thank you.

405
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:14,907
What's that?

406
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:17,659
Kids' stuff.

407
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:40,682
<i>Can anyone tell me what these
elegant gentlemen are hunting?</i>

408
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,894
- Gálvez?
- A pig.

409
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:48,148
Well, a boar.

410
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:51,151
Why not a giraffe?

411
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:53,778
- Carlos?
- A mammoth.

412
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:58,116
- Very good. And what's a mammoth?
- An ancestor of the elephant.

413
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,785
Very good.

414
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,206
Bet your tutor taught you that.

415
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,625
In those days,
men had to act in groups.

416
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:10,087
No one could give up.

417
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:14,132
Imagine the death of a mammoth.

418
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:16,176
It must have been terrible.

419
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:19,012
Mammoth steak. Damn!

420
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,476
When you get to draw your comics,

421
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,729
I could help you
write the stories.

422
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:31,608
I don't need anyone.

423
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:34,360
My stories and my drawings
are only mine, got that?

424
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:39,490
Tomorrow, we'll continue
with the second part of prehistory.

425
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:43,537
Leave your things
in the dormitory.

426
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:48,291
Then it's recess.

427
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,126
Santi…

428
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,925
- Satisfaction guaranteed.
- I hope so.

429
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:23,886
Here you go.

430
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,431
There isn't much.

431
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:29,517
Hey, you! Bastards!

432
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:32,437
What's going on?

433
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,188
International Brigade.

434
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:37,192
Caught two Spaniards,
six Canadians, one Chinaman.

435
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:40,653
What the fuck's a Chinaman
doing in a Spanish war?

436
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:17,732
You, look down! At your damn feet!
Against the wall!

437
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,250
A friend of yours, Doc?

438
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:46,678
Bomb…

439
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:49,013
if you're still alive…

440
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:51,266
Show me where Santi is.

441
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:22,880
Santi.

442
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:27,969
Talk to me.

443
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,764
I don't want anyone to die.

444
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,024
<i>Many of you will die.</i>

445
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:45,779
Please.

446
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,637
A grain of strength.

447
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:11,192
- You're up late.
- Please, give me a minute.

448
01:00:11,276 --> 01:00:14,404
I need to talk to you,
but I don't want the boys to hear.

449
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:17,448
Things are very bad out there.

450
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:19,993
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.

451
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:26,958
We have to get away.
Today, if possible.

452
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,210
- Ayala was taken prisoner -
- Ayala?

453
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:32,506
Yes! What if they questioned him?
We have to go.

454
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:34,673
Go where?

455
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:38,135
To Marseille, with the Ricards.

456
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:41,556
- We can't stay here another minute.
- I will not leave the boys!

457
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:45,768
Very well, we'll take them,
as many as we can.

458
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:48,979
- We'll use the gold.
- The gold belongs to the cause.

459
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:51,774
Fuck the cause, Carmen,
fuck the cause!

460
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:54,402
I always thought
there'd be an “afterwards” for us.

461
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:57,029
There is no afterwards!

462
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:03,578
Carmen, if anything
happened to you -

463
01:01:03,828 --> 01:01:05,830
Doctor.

464
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:10,084
The boys are waiting
for your permission to have breakfast.

465
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:23,180
I'll need some papers.

466
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,725
But we'll go.

467
01:01:31,773 --> 01:01:34,484
Boys, you may start.

468
01:01:34,609 --> 01:01:39,030
Come along. Get started, please.
Get started. Quick.

469
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:40,865
<i>My mother wrote to me.</i>

470
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:43,242
She's feeling better.

471
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:45,829
She's coming for me soon.

472
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,789
Last night I saw
the “one who sighs.”

473
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:50,708
Last night?

474
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:53,128
You're making it up.

475
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,549
It's Santi. I'm sure.

476
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:13,981
So. You're leaving?

477
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:17,485
Where are you going?

478
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:23,533
What about me?

479
01:02:26,494 --> 01:02:28,329
Fuck me, right?

480
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:39,382
That's good.

481
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:43,469
I want you to finish breakfast,
but while you're doing so,

482
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:47,598
listen very carefully because
I have to tell you something -

483
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:50,894
You may go,
but the gold stays here.

484
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:53,729
The gold?

485
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,358
- Is that all you care about?
- That's it.

486
01:03:00,403 --> 01:03:02,030
What are you doing?

487
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:11,497
I hid you here so you wouldn't enlist and
die out there. With no one to mourn you.

488
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:13,958
Give me the key.

489
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:16,628
But you know what?

490
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:19,547
Of all the orphans,
you were always the saddest.

491
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,215
The lost one.

492
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:24,635
- A prince without a kingdom.
- Shut up!

493
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:28,306
- The only one who was really alone.
- I said shut up!

494
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:31,142
Get out of here,
or <i>I'll</i> shoot you!

495
01:03:34,979 --> 01:03:38,232
Look who's come to save you.
The old sage.

496
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,111
Wonder if this weapon works.

497
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:47,324
You know that while you whisper
sweet things to this old hag…

498
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:50,161
I'm the one who has to screw her?

499
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:01,755
And now…

500
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:03,799
get out.

501
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:48,845
What did you see?

502
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:50,846
You know already.

503
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:53,808
I don't know anything.
Tell me.

504
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:58,270
Santi.

505
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:01,023
He's the “one who sighs.”

506
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:05,111
He's dead, isn't he?

507
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:20,209
Come on, boys.

508
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:22,337
Conchita…

509
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:25,506
would you bring me
a few cans of gas for the journey?

510
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,830
No. Please, no!

511
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:59,099
You'll all travel
in the back of the truck.

512
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,935
<i>It'll</i> be a long journey.

513
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:05,022
The older boys will have
to look after the little ones.

514
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:08,526
<i>If any of you are scared,
you can sit with me.</i>

515
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:18,285
What are you doing?

516
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:53,362
Are you all right, ma'am?

517
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:55,990
It's my bad leg.

518
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,742
It weighs more than ever.

519
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:12,673
What? Did you think someone
would just give us a farm?

520
01:08:13,716 --> 01:08:15,927
What are you doing with that?

521
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:19,847
You're crazy.

522
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:22,099
They're all inside.

523
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,935
You going to shoot me?

524
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:32,860
Please.

525
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:09,313
- What was that?
- The children!

526
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:12,190
Get them out!
It's going to blow up!

527
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:18,113
Get out! Outside!

528
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,295
Carmen?

529
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,093
Alma, leave it, come on!

530
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:45,725
Get out! All of you!

531
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:23,799
- I feel very cold.
- It's all right. Don't move.

532
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:26,051
Don't move, don't look.

533
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,095
Is it bad?

534
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:54,956
Fetch my bag from the lab.
Quickly!

535
01:13:15,309 --> 01:13:17,645
They won't have heard
the explosion in town.

536
01:13:17,728 --> 01:13:21,148
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.

537
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:26,487
If I walk all night,
<i>I'll</i> get to town by noon tomorrow.

538
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,585
I've…

539
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:44,129
I've got something to tell you.

540
01:13:44,755 --> 01:13:48,133
- If I don't tell you now -
- No, please, don't.

541
01:13:48,342 --> 01:13:50,386
I couldn't -

542
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:53,347
Can't hear you. My ear is busted.
So, please -

543
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:56,558
Just this once…

544
01:13:56,642 --> 01:13:58,811
let me do all the talking.

545
01:14:00,604 --> 01:14:03,398
- I've learned a new poem.
- Oh, yes, please.

546
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:06,193
A poem.

547
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:11,699
“Be near me
when my light is low…

548
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:14,368
When the blood creeps…

549
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:18,371
and the nerves prick and tingle…

550
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,834
and the heart is sick…

551
01:14:22,543 --> 01:14:25,379
and the wheels of Being slow.

552
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:29,424
Be near me…

553
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:32,553
when the sensuous frame
is rack'd with pangs…

554
01:14:33,554 --> 01:14:35,723
that conquer trust…

555
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:39,810
And time…

556
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:42,604
a maniac scattering dust…

557
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:46,024
And Life…
A Fury slinging flame…

558
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:50,362
Be near me…

559
01:14:50,863 --> 01:14:53,157
when I fade away…

560
01:14:53,866 --> 01:14:57,119
To point the term of human strife

561
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,625
The twilight…

562
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:08,255
of eternal day…

563
01:15:11,842 --> 01:15:15,179
And the low, dark verge of life.”

564
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,523
Miss.

565
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:35,783
A grain of strength.

566
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,441
Carlos, look.

567
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,323
Dr. Casares.

568
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:36,510
That son of a bitch.

569
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:45,769
I should have killed him
when I had the chance.

570
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:48,021
But he'll be back.

571
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:51,191
And <i>I'll</i> be right here…

572
01:16:51,525 --> 01:16:53,485
waiting for him.

573
01:16:55,529 --> 01:16:57,406
Carlitos, be good…

574
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,369
bring me my records, my music.

575
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:06,915
I need them.
All right?

576
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:44,494
Are you hungry?

577
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:47,414
“Eat beans, good for the heart.

578
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:49,541
The more you eat,
the more you fart.”

579
01:17:52,002 --> 01:17:54,129
My stomach's all upset.

580
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:56,965
But the younger ones
might be hungry.

581
01:18:03,513 --> 01:18:05,849
Could you kill someone?

582
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:10,520
I could.

583
01:18:10,604 --> 01:18:12,523
What you said
about Santi is true.

584
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:14,983
He's dead.

585
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:18,445
But I didn't kill him.

586
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:21,781
- I thought -
- I was with him.

587
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:24,909
I saw everything.

588
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:28,247
It started in the pit.

589
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:32,793
I dared him to come down with me,
at night, to gather slugs.

590
01:19:16,253 --> 01:19:18,589
Run, Jaime.
Jacinto's here.

591
01:19:35,856 --> 01:19:37,399
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

592
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:39,317
- Did you see the safe?
- No.

593
01:19:45,157 --> 01:19:47,618
Did you see the safe?

594
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:52,706
Why the fuck are you in here?

595
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,625
Who was with you?

596
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:13,143
Get up.

597
01:20:14,603 --> 01:20:16,438
Get up.

598
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:13,698
<i>I was a coward.</i>

599
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:17,743
<i>I was always afraid of Jacinto.</i>

600
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:21,664
Very afraid.

601
01:23:21,873 --> 01:23:24,000
But not anymore.

602
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,131
The next time I see him…

603
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:31,591
I know I'm going to kill him.

604
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:08,545
Look who's here.

605
01:24:11,548 --> 01:24:13,800
Watch how he handles her.

606
01:24:22,809 --> 01:24:25,228
Just say you're sorry
and get in the car.

607
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:29,608
I'm not scared of you.

608
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:32,611
Stop making me look like a fool.

609
01:24:32,694 --> 01:24:35,530
Say you're sorry.
They're looking at me.

610
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:40,952
I'm not afraid of you.

611
01:24:51,129 --> 01:24:53,298
Just say you're sorry.

612
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:00,638
You're an animal.

613
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:59,906
Doctor, I did what you told me.

614
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:01,866
I did what you told me.

615
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,578
But Owl's wound
won't stop bleeding.

616
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:08,206
Conchita.

617
01:26:11,334 --> 01:26:13,586
Someone's coming.

618
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,091
Someone's coming, Doctor!

619
01:26:19,259 --> 01:26:21,219
Help me get on my feet.

620
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:23,596
Jaime, start the record!

621
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,891
Turn the horn
towards the window!

622
01:26:51,499 --> 01:26:53,543
Didn't you say he was dead?

623
01:26:55,295 --> 01:26:56,880
Bastard!

624
01:26:58,798 --> 01:27:02,010
No one cares about this place.
We can wait.

625
01:27:14,981 --> 01:27:17,275
They're leaving!

626
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:32,915
All my life
I've always stopped short.

627
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:35,919
Always left things unfinished.

628
01:27:37,128 --> 01:27:40,506
I'm not going to leave you alone,
I promise you.

629
01:27:43,134 --> 01:27:46,304
I will never leave this place.

630
01:28:14,165 --> 01:28:16,334
We'll wait for you upstairs.

631
01:28:35,728 --> 01:28:37,730
I'm not going to run away.

632
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:41,484
I want to talk to you.

633
01:28:52,245 --> 01:28:53,830
Nothing.

634
01:28:53,913 --> 01:28:56,082
They must have driven on.

635
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:24,819
Tell me. What do you want?

636
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:27,404
Jacinto.

637
01:29:31,617 --> 01:29:34,578
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

638
01:29:35,538 --> 01:29:37,457
I understand.

639
01:29:40,293 --> 01:29:42,462
I'm going to help you.

640
01:29:44,005 --> 01:29:47,675
Jaime! I saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!

641
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:06,819
I had to break
the old man's fingers.

642
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:10,865
Even in death, he's stubborn.

643
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:19,707
Hurry up! Come on!

644
01:30:26,839 --> 01:30:28,674
There's something here!

645
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:31,010
Marcelo! Out of the way!

646
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:41,104
Fucking great.
It wasn't a complete waste of time.

647
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:53,283
This is yours, isn't it?

648
01:31:38,578 --> 01:31:40,747
We have to get out of here.

649
01:31:46,836 --> 01:31:49,922
One of us has to climb
through the window.

650
01:31:52,884 --> 01:31:54,677
And then open the door.

651
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,887
And what then?

652
01:31:57,221 --> 01:31:59,140
What's wrong?

653
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:00,725
You scared?

654
01:32:00,808 --> 01:32:04,645
Yes, I am, asshole.
You're not wounded. Owl is.

655
01:32:05,146 --> 01:32:08,149
You're not bleeding.
Fuck, you're not even hurt.

656
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:11,235
Santi is dead.

657
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:13,279
Jacinto killed him.

658
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:17,241
And if we stay like this,
he'll kill us all.

659
01:32:18,993 --> 01:32:21,537
Do you want to sit and wait?

660
01:32:22,205 --> 01:32:24,541
You think he'll just let us go?

661
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:28,461
That it'll all work out
if we behave?

662
01:32:30,463 --> 01:32:32,423
They have the rifle.

663
01:32:32,506 --> 01:32:35,384
They're bigger than us,
much stronger.

664
01:32:42,141 --> 01:32:44,810
Yes. But there are more of us.

665
01:33:02,453 --> 01:33:03,996
Wait!

666
01:33:13,547 --> 01:33:16,508
Wait.
Check if they're still working.

667
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:28,520
- Go on.
- All right.

668
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:45,329
Gálvez, did you hurt yourself?

669
01:33:47,665 --> 01:33:49,417
Just a bit.

670
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:06,892
Fuck! Look again!

671
01:34:08,102 --> 01:34:11,731
There's nothing here but souvenirs,
photographs! Just crap!

672
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,445
One of us has to go out
and get Gálvez.

673
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:20,697
<i>- Who'll do it?
- I'll go.</i>

674
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:24,243
No, not you. <i>I'll</i> go.
I'm skinnier.

675
01:34:43,054 --> 01:34:45,098
Who opened it?

676
01:35:00,863 --> 01:35:03,240
Dr. Casares opened the door.

677
01:35:06,577 --> 01:35:09,872
He said I'd be all right,
and that we should all be brave.

678
01:35:20,466 --> 01:35:23,636
No fucking gold here!
You hear me?

679
01:35:24,387 --> 01:35:27,974
You and your pipe dreams!
Fuck me!

680
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:32,019
Gold, gold. My ass!

681
01:35:39,819 --> 01:35:41,404
My father, see?

682
01:35:41,821 --> 01:35:43,823
He was from Calanda.

683
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,368
He was an accountant.
Quite dapper. Look.

684
01:35:50,955 --> 01:35:52,790
My mother, from Toledo.

685
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:56,252
And that. That's me.

686
01:35:57,044 --> 01:35:59,338
It's blurred 'cause I moved.

687
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:01,632
But that's me. I'm sure.

688
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:03,675
We're leaving tomorrow.

689
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:08,514
Pig, do you think your brother
in Portugal could put us up?

690
01:36:09,348 --> 01:36:11,267
We don't have much time.

691
01:36:16,814 --> 01:36:19,984
“How lonely,
the prince without a kingdom,

692
01:36:20,568 --> 01:36:22,695
the man without warmth.

693
01:36:23,195 --> 01:36:26,073
"Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga."

694
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:37,793
I saw that gold.

695
01:36:38,043 --> 01:36:39,628
It's here.

696
01:36:39,712 --> 01:36:41,714
We just have to look for it.

697
01:36:45,926 --> 01:36:48,679
We'll find it, and tomorrow
we'll burn this place down.

698
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:51,932
- And the boys?
- They've got no parents.

699
01:36:52,266 --> 01:36:55,227
They've got no one.
Who'll miss them?

700
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,731
We're at war.

701
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:02,985
Just a drop in the ocean.

702
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,574
Look, Jacinto.

703
01:37:08,657 --> 01:37:11,285
Burn the place, kill the kids,
I don't give a shit.

704
01:37:11,869 --> 01:37:14,747
But we're getting
out of here tomorrow.

705
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,393
- We need stuff from the car.
- Hurry up.

706
01:37:36,519 --> 01:37:38,271
<i>I'll</i> need a hand.

707
01:37:40,314 --> 01:37:42,191
Come on, Pig.

708
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:30,989
You're crazy, asshole!

709
01:38:31,574 --> 01:38:33,701
Fuck you!

710
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:38,038
No, fuck you!
It's all for me.

711
01:39:08,694 --> 01:39:10,696
Son of a bitch!

712
01:40:07,086 --> 01:40:08,754
What a joke!

713
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,480
Gálvez, you go over there.

714
01:40:37,449 --> 01:40:39,785
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle!

01:40:59,638 --> 01:41:00,764
Santi…

716
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:46,787
<i>What is a ghost?</i>

717
01:42:47,079 --> 01:42:51,083
<i>A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?</i>

718
01:42:53,418 --> 01:42:56,087
<i>A moment of pain, perhaps.</i>

719
01:43:02,928 --> 01:43:06,014
<i>Something dead
which still seems to be alive.</i>

720
01:43:10,519 --> 01:43:13,480
<i>An emotion suspended in</i> time.

721
01:43:21,947 --> 01:43:24,283
<i>Like a blurred photograph.</i>

722
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:36,461
<i>Like an insect trapped in amber.</i>

723
01:43:52,936 --> 01:43:54,479
<i>A ghost.</i>

724
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,482
<i>That's what I am.</i>

725
01:44:04,072 --> 01:44:07,367
<i>TO MY PARENTS</i>
