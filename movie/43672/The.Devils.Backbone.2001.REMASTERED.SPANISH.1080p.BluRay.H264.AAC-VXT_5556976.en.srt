00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:54,565
<i>What is a ghost?</i>

3
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:59,069
<i>A tragedy condemned</i>
<i>to repeat itself time and again?</i>

4
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:16,837
<i>A moment of pain, perhaps.</i>

5
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:29,141
<i>Something dead</i>
<i>which still seems to be alive.</i>

6
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:42,362
<i>An emotion suspended in time.</i>

7
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,411
<i>Like a blurred photograph.</i>

8
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,882
<i>Like an insect trapped in amber.</i>

9
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:51,241
THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE

10
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:08,925
We'll be there soon.

11
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,279
What the...?

12
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:31,091
It fell quite a while ago,
but it never exploded.

13
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:35,595
They came, they defused it,

14
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:38,890
and they left it there.
Nobody can move it.

15
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,316
Follow me, please.

16
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:52,696
Carlos...

17
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:55,907
Wait for me here. We won't be long.

18
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,078
Who are those people outside?

19
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:02,914
The caretaker
and two men who help him.

20
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:08,336
They're from the town.
There's always work to do here.

21
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:11,089
They're building a chicken coop.

22
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:23,226
What's going on out there?

23
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,647
- They've arrived.
- Ayala and Dominguez again?

24
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:31,902
Yes. Ayala's wounded.

25
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:36,198
They're always in trouble.

26
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,368
They've brought another boy.

27
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:50,253
As if we didn't have
enough already.

28
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:56,927
Let's go.

29
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,551
Are you a new kid?

30
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:24,264
Got any candy?
Or a bit of bread?

31
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,185
I'm Galvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he sure sees a lot.

32
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:32,188
I'm Carlos.

33
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,652
Got any fruit,
even if it's soft?

34
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:41,448
No, but I've got
some comics and toys.

35
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:43,408
- Want to see them?
- Yeah.

36
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:49,205
I can't do it.
I can't accept another boy.

37
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:52,334
I can barely feed the ones
who are here. I'm sorry.

38
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:57,464
He's the son of a comrade
killed at the front.

39
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,468
- The boy doesn't know.
- He doesn't know.

40
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:04,220
Your husband was a leftist,
a brave man.

41
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,932
Oh, no! I'm the brave one.

42
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:10,435
Ricardo was a man of books,
of ideas.

43
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:14,522
He decided to die and leave me here
to defend his ideals.

44
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:19,569
The Nationalists will arrive any day
and what will they find?

45
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,114
Reds looking after Reds' children.

46
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,991
Not to mention this!

47
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:29,120
I can't keep it anymore.
If you want to leave the boy...

48
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:31,081
take the rest of the gold.

49
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,625
There are 1 0 ingots left.

50
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:35,543
At least you can buy guns.

51
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,588
I can't even buy bread with it.

52
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:41,424
- Take it away.
- We can't.

53
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,260
- We're crossing enemy lines.
- You decide.

54
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:47,305
The boy goes hungry here
or gets killed out there.

55
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:54,604
Class time! Come on!

56
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:02,654
Look, Owl, a comic book!

57
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:06,449
I'll swap you.

58
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:11,496
Look at this marble.
It's my favourite. It's from China.

59
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:13,957
Or look at this one.

60
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,042
Owl made it himself.

61
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:19,337
All made from snot and mud.
It's six months of snot.

62
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:23,508
Hey, you! That's mine!

63
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:25,719
- Are you here to stay?
- No.

64
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,346
Then why are you here?

65
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:31,307
I came with Mr Ayala, my tutor.

66
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:36,646
- What the hell's a tutor?
- He looks after me when my father's away.

67
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:40,567
Shit, that's posh!
No one here has one of those.

68
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,820
Take the comic from me. Go on.

69
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,822
Take it away. Come on.

70
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,622
Carlos, look!

71
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,126
Mr Ayala.

72
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:04,507
Your tutor's leaving you, you queer!

73
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:42,962
Stay with him for a while.
He seems quite meek.

74
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,590
I'm sure you'll get along.

75
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,526
We'll have to fix it.

76
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,196
The Count of Monte Cristo.

77
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:11,866
Has Edmond Dantes
broken out of prison yet?

78
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:16,704
- Has he met Abbot Faria?
- They're digging a tunnel.

79
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:19,541
- Do they manage to escape?
- I don't know.

80
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,918
Why don't you read on,
then tell me?

81
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,842
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.

82
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:31,302
She teaches maths and reading.

83
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:34,722
And the elegant lady you saw,
remember?

84
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:36,641
Her name is Carmen.

85
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:39,477
- Is she your girlfriend?
- She's the principal.

86
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:41,521
Why did they leave me here?

87
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:46,776
- Why can't I be with my father?
- Carlitos...

88
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:50,196
You're staying with us for a while.
Just for a while.

89
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,949
So be patient.

90
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:01,249
Your soap has to last you all year.

91
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,293
Be careful with it.

92
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:06,296
Or you'll be punished
with two weeks of extra tasks.

93
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,260
You can play in the yard,
but never inside the building.

94
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:30,069
This is your bed.

95
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:31,779
Number 1 2.

96
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,242
Why are there so many empty beds?

97
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:39,204
Some boys run away,
but I wouldn't advise it.

98
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:44,375
It's a day's walk to town.
The nights are cold and the days...

99
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:55,053
For your locker.

100
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,097
Do you understand?

101
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,601
There are no bars here.
This isn't a prison.

102
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:22,914
See where they put the new kid?

103
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,543
- In Santi's bed.
- Shut up!

104
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,138
Pig and I think that
even though you complain a lot...

105
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:40,932
you're all right here.

106
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:44,143
Far away from the war,
well hidden.

107
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:46,646
Well looked after.

108
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:49,524
- What could be better?
- Granada.

109
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,652
Why go to Granada?

110
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:54,404
We're getting married.

111
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:58,116
We'll buy a farm.

112
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,452
Sure.

113
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:03,496
Granada!

114
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,043
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?

115
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:11,045
I don't need anyone.

116
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:15,216
I've managed fine
on my own so far...

117
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:17,343
Right.

118
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:18,803
And without parents.

119
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:26,394
- Those Reds were here for the gold.
- Yeah, the school's gold.

120
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,771
That's why they eat so well here...
too much gold.

121
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:33,526
You don't believe me now,
but you will.

122
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:37,697
I'll try these two tonight
and let you know what happens.

123
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:40,783
That's great, kid.
Got a smoke?

124
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:44,454
- No.
- All right, so long.

125
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:57,717
I don't like those two.

126
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,929
They make me sick.

127
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:05,099
This place makes me sick.

128
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:12,065
When I was a kid...

129
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:16,569
I'd stand here
in the middle of the yard...

130
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:19,864
and I'd look up at the sky.

131
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,826
I dreamed of getting out of here.

132
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:26,079
I prayed to become rich...

133
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:28,873
so I could buy this dump
and tear it down.

134
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:32,126
Forget it now.

135
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,595
I don't want anyone to know
I spent 1 5 years here.

136
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:46,808
Well, I'm glad you came back.

137
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,944
Let's go to my room.
It's getting cold.

138
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,468
San...ti...

139
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,080
Who are you?

140
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,327
What are you doing?

141
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:56,622
- Me? Nothing.
- What the hell's going on?

142
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,626
The fucking new kid
spilled our water.

143
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,509
Come on.

144
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,554
You'll have to get more
from the kitchen.

145
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,598
Isn't that off limits?

146
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:16,058
No one's ever been caught.

147
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:18,185
What about the "one who sighs"?

148
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:22,648
What's it to be?
Are you going or not?

149
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:24,650
Who's the "one who sighs"?

150
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,364
- You're chickenshit.
- No, I'm not.

151
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,742
You're a shit, a queer.

152
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:36,120
All right, I'll go.

153
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:38,664
But you're coming with me.

154
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,875
We'll each fill a jug.

155
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:44,170
But if you're scared...

156
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:11,447
They say it's switched off.

157
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,450
But I don't believe it.

158
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:21,624
Put your ear against her,
you'll hear ticking.

159
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:27,421
That's her heart.

160
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:29,799
She's still alive.

161
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,761
And she knows we're here.

162
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:38,516
Hide!

163
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,668
That one.

164
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:34,780
Come on.

165
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:16,447
See you outside.

166
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:28,769
"No one's ever been caught."
Bastard.

167
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,445
Shit!

168
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:37,958
Hello?

169
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,326
Who are you?

170
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,704
Do you live down here?

171
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:54,344
Many of you will die.

172
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:17,326
Jaime!

173
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:40,409
What are you up to?

174
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,759
"Out, out, yearnings of mine.
Let not respect bind you.

175
00:31:57,885 --> 00:32:01,096
"It flatters pity...

176
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:05,267
"It flatters pity not to be able to hide.

177
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:10,230
"Let your lips bear witness

178
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:12,649
"to the blaze in your heart.

179
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:16,528
"No one will believe the fire
if the smoke sends no signals.

180
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:20,032
"He who cares for his well-being
keeps not his feelings silent.

181
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:25,203
"My grief is greater than I.

182
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:28,081
"And that being so,

183
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:33,587
"it will be easier...

184
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:36,548
"for it to defeat me...

185
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:39,217
"than for me to command it.

186
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:45,932
"Consideration does not suffice
to prevent the cry.

187
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:49,811
"He is not a brave prisoner
who dares not break down his jail."

188
00:33:16,297 --> 00:33:18,048
A grain of strength.

189
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:33,814
Carlos, are you going to tell me
who was with you last night?

190
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:40,862
He's not going to tell.

191
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:45,325
He'll squeal in the end.
Just wait and see.

192
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:47,327
You understand?

193
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:51,331
Then, for the last time,

194
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:55,460
who was with you last night?

195
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:57,587
I was alone.

196
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:03,301
That boy won't talk.

197
00:34:03,428 --> 00:34:06,096
If we want to know
who was with him,

198
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:11,226
- What's for breakfast?
- Milk and bread.

199
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:13,103
Perfect.

200
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:16,523
Very well. You may begin.

201
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:27,117
They think Carlos has told,
but they don't care.

202
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:30,370
They're ravenous.
Look at how they're eating.

203
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:35,792
The first one to look up
from his plate is his accomplice.

204
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:43,216
Marcos, Galvez, Jaime and Owl.
Come here!

205
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,556
I knew you wouldn't squeal.

206
00:34:49,682 --> 00:34:51,892
Dr Casares tricked me.

207
00:34:52,018 --> 00:34:54,227
Just what I said.

208
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:57,898
It isn't your fault we were punished.

209
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:01,860
- Dr Casares is real smart.
- He sure is!

210
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:07,157
Careful.

211
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:09,826
Come on, Owl.

212
00:35:11,704 --> 00:35:15,123
Shit, for a dead guy,
he sure weighs a lot!

213
00:35:18,836 --> 00:35:20,670
Well, well!

214
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:24,049
Christ in the yard
and John the Baptist in here.

215
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:27,052
Are things that bad?

216
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:31,014
If the new Spain
is Catholic and apostolic...

217
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:36,269
Try it now.

218
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:45,737
I told you.

219
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:48,532
- Dance with me.
- No.

220
00:35:48,658 --> 00:35:51,826
- Come on, dance with me.
- No.

221
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:54,663
I can't dance.

222
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:03,880
Ayala said so.

223
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:07,050
Catalonia is about to fall.

224
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:11,096
Then Madrid will fall, and then...

225
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,018
There's talk of a ghost.
Have you heard?

226
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:19,062
Yes.

227
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:22,774
Sometimes I think
that we are the ghosts.

228
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:27,654
Galvez, last night, you didn't shoot.

229
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,864
That's right.

230
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:35,161
- Wow, that's great!
- It's for you.

231
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,587
Why are they laughing?

232
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:46,756
Fuckers.

233
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:55,807
Go back to Argentina,
while you still can.

234
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:58,393
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.

235
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:02,480
England or France
might still intervene.

236
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:06,651
That's just wishful thinking.

237
00:37:06,777 --> 00:37:09,112
- You're like Ricardo.
- No.

238
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:12,198
No, I'm not like him.

239
00:37:12,325 --> 00:37:15,327
Twenty years ago,
I found the place for me.

240
00:37:18,998 --> 00:37:20,957
And I stayed.

241
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,668
That's all.

242
00:37:25,421 --> 00:37:27,172
Look at it jump!

243
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:34,512
Where's the new kid?

244
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:48,443
Are you the "one who sighs"?

245
00:37:51,322 --> 00:37:53,406
Do you live down there?

246
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,828
Listen.

247
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,632
What are you up to?
Go on, call Dr Casares.

248
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:12,634
Arse-licker!

249
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:17,889
Throw him down! Go on!

250
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,481
He can't swim!

251
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:48,420
- Over there!
- Over there, to your left!

252
00:39:13,821 --> 00:39:15,405
There he is!

253
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:19,159
Grab him! Careful!

254
00:39:37,553 --> 00:39:39,763
What's going on?

255
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,475
What have I told you?

256
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:45,977
And you, eh?

257
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:48,813
What the fuck are you doing
down here?

258
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,736
Whose is this?

259
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,697
It's mine.

260
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:04,996
If anything happens to you,
I get the blame.

261
00:40:09,794 --> 00:40:11,252
Get out!

262
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,299
Out!

263
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,853
Say a word about this
and I'll cut you in half. Got that?

264
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,492
There you go.

265
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:45,495
Our Carlos has been here
five minutes,

266
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:47,914
and already he's in trouble.

267
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,251
Have you read any more
of Monte Cristo?

268
00:40:51,877 --> 00:40:54,462
Do you believe in ghosts?

269
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:57,465
There aren't any in the novel.

270
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:02,720
I think I saw one, here.

271
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,183
Carlos, as you can see,

272
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:10,395
I'm a man of science.

273
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:13,648
But Spain is full of superstition.
Come here.

274
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:17,694
Europe is sick with fear now,
and fear sickens the soul.

275
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,613
And that, in turn,
makes us see things.

276
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:22,156
In town...

277
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:24,868
...they call this...

278
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,538
"the Devil's Backbone."

279
00:41:28,664 --> 00:41:30,123
They say a lot of things.

280
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:33,167
That this happens to children
who shouldn't have been born.

281
00:41:33,294 --> 00:41:36,212
"Nobody's children." But that's a lie.

282
00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:39,299
Poverty and disease. That's all it is.

283
00:41:41,427 --> 00:41:44,429
The liquid they're in
is called "limbo water".

284
00:41:44,555 --> 00:41:50,101
In the old days, it was made
with various spices, cloves, rum.

285
00:41:50,936 --> 00:41:54,731
So this is very, very old rum.

286
00:41:54,857 --> 00:41:59,152
I sell it in town, and the money
keeps the school going.

287
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:00,737
Do they drink it?

288
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:05,825
They say it helps to cure blindness,
kidney ailments,

289
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,871
and also, apparently...impotence.

290
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:15,627
Rubbish, but you know, after 60,
men will pay anything just to...

291
00:42:15,753 --> 00:42:17,337
You know.

292
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:21,799
So if you're going to believe
in ghosts and all that rubbish,

293
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:26,137
you should have a sip of this
to heal your wound.

294
00:42:26,263 --> 00:42:30,266
No, I'm not sure that I saw a ghost.
May I go now?

295
00:42:30,976 --> 00:42:32,810
Yes, of course.

296
00:42:34,313 --> 00:42:36,439
And be more careful!

297
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:08,763
Calm down.

298
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:10,890
I'm not going to hit you.

299
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:13,518
So don't make any noise.

300
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:18,856
Carlos, get out your comics
so we can look at them.

301
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:31,619
- That ring's pretty.
- It's from a cigar.

302
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:35,665
I found it four summers ago.
It's very pretty.

303
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:38,209
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.

304
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,170
Look.

305
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,924
A naked woman.
It's really well drawn, like a photo.

306
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,553
She's a looker! Who drew this?

307
00:43:49,138 --> 00:43:51,305
Her pussy's the wrong way round.

308
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:55,309
- It looks like a mouth.
- What would you lot know?

309
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:58,980
Look, a slice of fig cake.

310
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:01,899
It's a bit squashed
but it tastes good.

311
00:44:02,026 --> 00:44:05,570
No, give me back my comic.
I want it back.

312
00:44:06,572 --> 00:44:08,281
All right.

313
00:44:09,033 --> 00:44:11,617
I'll give it to you later.
It's in my locker.

314
00:44:14,496 --> 00:44:16,205
You're a real artist.

315
00:44:16,331 --> 00:44:18,166
When I grow up, I want to draw comics.

316
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:21,419
- Like mine?
- No, much better.

317
00:44:21,545 --> 00:44:23,755
With more fights, more treasures.

318
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:25,840
And big ships
with lots of cannons.

319
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:29,677
These bugs are disgusting.
What do they eat?

320
00:44:31,221 --> 00:44:33,681
Did you hear that?

321
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,641
A sigh.

322
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:37,727
I didn't hear it.

323
00:44:37,853 --> 00:44:40,229
I heard it too.

324
00:45:07,966 --> 00:45:09,884
Don't kiss me.

325
00:45:13,514 --> 00:45:15,681
Right, I forgot.

326
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:22,730
This is the last time.

327
00:45:23,774 --> 00:45:25,942
"This is the last time."

328
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:28,069
Same old story.

329
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:42,959
Don't make any noise.

330
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:47,922
- Scared the old man will hear?
- I've never been scared.

331
00:45:49,842 --> 00:45:52,176
I'm ashamed.

332
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,139
Right...

333
00:45:56,932 --> 00:46:00,184
You're ashamed of me.
Not him.

334
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:02,645
He's a gentleman.

335
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:06,858
What a pity that isn't enough.

336
00:46:11,738 --> 00:46:14,198
You need a hard cock as well.

337
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,993
And your husband and the doctor...

338
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:19,954
Tough luck.

339
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,047
The old man looks at you
with love.

340
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:33,342
He did that even when
your husband was alive.

341
00:46:33,468 --> 00:46:35,094
I was 1 7.

342
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,431
By then, they took care
of the poetry,

343
00:46:38,557 --> 00:46:40,766
and I of the flesh.

344
00:46:44,855 --> 00:46:46,355
This leg...

345
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:51,402
I don't like to think
about this leg.

346
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:54,989
It hurts.

347
00:46:56,658 --> 00:46:58,743
Some days I can't bear it.

348
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,915
But I need it to stay on my feet.

349
00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:48,709
I saw those lights again today
in the sky.

350
00:47:48,835 --> 00:47:50,878
That's the war. It'll never end.

351
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:52,838
The war's shit.

352
00:47:52,965 --> 00:47:54,966
Well, I like it.

353
00:47:55,092 --> 00:47:56,676
You like it, dickhead?

354
00:47:56,802 --> 00:47:59,845
Yeah, because you see
the planes doing this.

355
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:06,435
My mother says that the earth's
so dry here and the air's so hot,

356
00:48:06,561 --> 00:48:09,605
that the dead get stuck
halfway to heaven.

357
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:13,150
- That's rubbish!
- It's like the "one who sighs".

358
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:17,571
Not that again, you little shit!

359
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,788
Even if it annoys him,
there's a ghost.

360
00:48:25,914 --> 00:48:29,458
The day the bomb fell,
a boy disappeared. Santi.

361
00:48:29,584 --> 00:48:32,295
Since then, no one has dared
to take Jaime on.

362
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:34,588
Santi slept in your bed, number 1 2.

363
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:36,924
Shit, I'm telling the story.

364
00:48:37,843 --> 00:48:40,511
The teachers think that
when the bomb fell,

365
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:43,264
Santi got scared and ran away,

366
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,517
and maybe some shepherds
found him and he's alive.

367
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:49,312
Or a cutthroat got him
and took his blood.

368
00:48:49,438 --> 00:48:50,604
Yeah.

369
00:48:50,731 --> 00:48:54,608
They sell the blood to rich people
to cure their tuberculosis.

370
00:48:54,735 --> 00:48:56,819
And where's the ghost?

371
00:48:56,945 --> 00:48:58,612
It came with the bomb.

372
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:01,198
Maybe if you ask it...

373
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,147
Take that one.

374
00:49:39,613 --> 00:49:41,614
Out of the way.

375
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:53,334
Put those in, but be careful!

376
00:49:54,169 --> 00:49:56,128
Don't break them.

377
00:50:31,623 --> 00:50:33,332
Miss.

378
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:37,920
Look, I found this.

379
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:40,965
I thought you'd like it.

380
00:50:43,135 --> 00:50:45,136
Open the gate, Jaime.

381
00:50:46,263 --> 00:50:47,972
It's lovely.

382
00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:53,477
It may look like gold, but it isn't.

383
00:50:53,603 --> 00:50:56,689
Well, for me, it is.

384
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:00,192
It's beautiful.

385
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:01,819
Thank you.

386
00:51:13,123 --> 00:51:14,540
What's that?

387
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:17,460
Kids' stuff.

388
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:40,691
Can anyone tell me what these
elegant gentlemen are hunting?

389
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:44,278
- Galvez?
- A pig.

390
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:47,948
Well, a boar.

391
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:50,868
Why not a giraffe?

392
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,079
- Carlos?
- A mammoth.

393
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:57,917
- Very good. And what's a mammoth?
- An ancestor of the elephant.

394
00:51:58,043 --> 00:51:59,835
Very good.

395
00:52:01,922 --> 00:52:04,048
Your tutor taught you that.

396
00:52:04,174 --> 00:52:06,509
In those days,
men had to act in groups.

397
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:09,970
No one could give up.

398
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:14,266
Imagine the death of a mammoth.

399
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:16,060
It must have been terrible.

400
00:52:16,186 --> 00:52:18,896
A mammoth steak, great!

401
00:52:22,192 --> 00:52:24,193
When you get to draw your comics,

402
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,613
I could help you write the stories.

403
00:52:29,824 --> 00:52:31,450
I don't need anyone.

404
00:52:31,576 --> 00:52:34,286
My stories and my drawings
are mine, got that?

405
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:39,291
Tomorrow, we'll continue
with the second part of prehistory.

406
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:43,462
Leave your things in the dormitory.

407
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:48,259
Then it's recess.

408
00:54:11,468 --> 00:54:13,135
Santi...

409
00:54:18,725 --> 00:54:20,934
- Satisfaction guaranteed.
- I hope so.

410
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:24,146
Here you go.

411
00:54:24,272 --> 00:54:26,315
There isn't much.

412
00:54:26,441 --> 00:54:29,568
Hey, you! Bastards!

413
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:32,446
What's going on?

414
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:34,198
International Brigade.

415
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:37,493
Two Spaniards,
six Canadians, one Chinaman.

416
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:40,663
What the fuck's a Chinaman
doing in a Spanish war?

417
00:55:14,364 --> 00:55:17,825
You, look at your damn feet!
Against the wall!

418
00:55:34,426 --> 00:55:36,343
A friend of yours, Doc?

419
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:48,897
Bomb, if you're alive,

420
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:51,358
tell me where Santi is.

421
00:56:21,055 --> 00:56:22,848
Santi.

422
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,644
Talk to me.

423
00:56:29,564 --> 00:56:31,899
I don't want anyone to die.

424
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:41,200
Many of you will die.

425
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,037
Please.

426
00:59:58,189 --> 01:00:00,190
A grain of strength...

427
01:00:08,449 --> 01:00:11,118
- You're up late.
- Please, give me a minute.

428
01:00:11,244 --> 01:00:14,329
I need to talk to you,
but I don't want the boys to hear.

429
01:00:14,455 --> 01:00:17,374
Things are very bad out there.

430
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,960
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.

431
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,925
We have to get away.
Today, if possible.

432
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:29,136
- Ayala was taken prisoner...
- Ayala?

433
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:32,180
Yes, I'm sure they questioned him.
We have to go.

434
01:00:32,306 --> 01:00:33,724
Go where?

435
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:37,978
To Marseille, with the Ricards.

436
01:00:38,104 --> 01:00:41,398
- We can't stay here another minute.
- But I can't leave the boys!

437
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:45,444
Very well, we'll take them,
as many as we can.

438
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,822
- We'll use the gold.
- The gold belongs to the cause.

439
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:51,700
Fuck the cause, Carmen,
fuck the cause!

440
01:00:51,826 --> 01:00:54,244
I always thought
there'd be an afterwards.

441
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:56,913
There is no afterwards!

442
01:01:00,043 --> 01:01:03,837
Carmen,
if anything happened to you...

443
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:05,714
Doctor.

444
01:01:06,507 --> 01:01:10,010
The boys are waiting
for your permission to have breakfast.

445
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:22,981
I'll need some papers.

446
01:01:23,649 --> 01:01:25,525
But we'll go.

447
01:01:31,574 --> 01:01:34,326
Boys, you may start.

448
01:01:34,452 --> 01:01:38,830
Come along. Get started, please.
Get started.

449
01:01:38,956 --> 01:01:42,167
My mother wrote to me.
She's a lot better.

450
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:45,629
She's coming for me soon.

451
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:48,590
Last night I saw the "one who sighs".

452
01:01:48,716 --> 01:01:50,509
Last night?

453
01:01:50,635 --> 01:01:52,928
You're making it up.

454
01:01:55,765 --> 01:01:58,350
It's Santi. I'm sure.

455
01:02:12,156 --> 01:02:14,324
Are you leaving?

456
01:02:15,284 --> 01:02:17,285
Where are you going?

457
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,375
What about me?

458
01:02:26,129 --> 01:02:28,421
Fuck me, right?

459
01:02:37,181 --> 01:02:39,182
That's good.

460
01:02:39,308 --> 01:02:43,103
I want you to finish breakfast,
but while you're doing so,

461
01:02:43,688 --> 01:02:47,440
listen very carefully
because I have to tell you something.

462
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:50,569
You may go,
but the gold stays here.

463
01:02:51,737 --> 01:02:53,155
The gold?

464
01:02:53,948 --> 01:02:57,117
- Is that all you care about?
- That's it.

465
01:03:00,204 --> 01:03:01,830
What are you doing?

466
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,131
I hid you here so you wouldn't die
outside with no one to mourn you.

467
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:12,883
Give me the key.

468
01:03:14,385 --> 01:03:16,386
You know what?

469
01:03:16,512 --> 01:03:19,723
Of all the orphans,
you were always the saddest.

470
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:23,393
The lost one.
A prince without a kingdom.

471
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:25,061
Shut up!

472
01:03:25,188 --> 01:03:27,939
- The only one who was really alone.
- I said shut up!

473
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:30,859
Get out of here, or I'll shoot you!

474
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:37,949
Look who's come to save you.
The old sage.

475
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,995
Will this weapon work?

476
01:03:43,915 --> 01:03:48,168
You know that while you whisper
sweet things to this old hag,

477
01:03:48,294 --> 01:03:50,754
I'm the one who has to screw her?

478
01:03:59,931 --> 01:04:02,766
And now...get out.

479
01:04:46,602 --> 01:04:48,979
What did you see?

480
01:04:49,105 --> 01:04:51,022
You know already.

481
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:53,692
I don't know anything. Tell me.

482
01:04:56,529 --> 01:04:58,196
Santi.

483
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:00,699
Santi's the "one who sighs".

484
01:05:02,868 --> 01:05:05,036
He's dead, isn't he?

485
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:20,218
Come on, boys.

486
01:05:20,344 --> 01:05:21,761
Conchita...

487
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:25,473
Would you bring me
a few cans of gas for the journey?

488
01:06:38,047 --> 01:06:39,839
Please, no!

489
01:06:55,898 --> 01:06:58,733
You'll all travel in the back
of the truck.

490
01:06:59,735 --> 01:07:01,861
It'll be a long journey.

491
01:07:01,987 --> 01:07:04,864
The older boys will have
to look after the little ones.

492
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:08,326
If any of you are scared,
you can sit with me.

493
01:07:16,252 --> 01:07:18,336
What are you doing?

494
01:07:50,953 --> 01:07:53,455
Are you all right, madam?

495
01:07:53,581 --> 01:07:55,582
It's my bad leg.

496
01:07:56,584 --> 01:07:58,585
It's heavier than ever.

497
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:12,056
Did you think someone
would just give us a farm?

498
01:08:13,642 --> 01:08:15,643
What are you doing with that?

499
01:08:17,938 --> 01:08:21,065
You're crazy. They're all inside.

500
01:08:22,735 --> 01:08:24,819
Are you going to shoot me?

501
01:08:31,243 --> 01:08:32,785
Please...

502
01:09:07,613 --> 01:09:09,197
- What was that?
- The children!

503
01:09:09,323 --> 01:09:12,116
Get them out! It's going to blow up!

504
01:09:15,204 --> 01:09:18,081
Get out! Outside!

505
01:09:31,637 --> 01:09:33,221
Carmen?

506
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,893
Alma, leave it be, come on!

507
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,525
Get out! All of you!

508
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,641
- I'm very cold.
- It's all right. Don't move.

509
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:26,018
Don't move, don't look.

510
01:12:26,145 --> 01:12:27,979
Is it bad?

511
01:12:51,754 --> 01:12:54,630
Fetch my bag from the lab.
Quickly!

512
01:13:15,152 --> 01:13:17,528
They won't have heard
the explosion in town.

513
01:13:17,654 --> 01:13:21,657
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.

514
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:26,370
If I walk all night,
I'll get to town by noon tomorrow.

515
01:13:39,802 --> 01:13:41,469
I've...

516
01:13:41,595 --> 01:13:44,096
I've got something to tell you.

517
01:13:44,723 --> 01:13:48,142
- If I don't tell you now...
- No, please, don't.

518
01:13:48,268 --> 01:13:50,269
I couldn't...

519
01:13:50,395 --> 01:13:53,314
I can't hear you.
So, please...

520
01:13:54,233 --> 01:13:58,277
This time...let me do the talking.

521
01:14:00,572 --> 01:14:03,366
- I've learned a new poem.
- Yes.

522
01:14:04,034 --> 01:14:06,202
A poem.

523
01:14:08,747 --> 01:14:11,833
"Stay by my side
as my light grows dim,

524
01:14:11,959 --> 01:14:14,293
"as my blood slows down,

525
01:14:15,254 --> 01:14:18,297
"and my nerves shatter
with stabbing pain,

526
01:14:19,466 --> 01:14:21,801
"as my heart grows weak,

527
01:14:22,553 --> 01:14:25,388
"and the wheels of my being
turn slowly.

528
01:14:27,266 --> 01:14:29,350
"Stay by my side

529
01:14:29,476 --> 01:14:32,562
"as my fragile body is racked by pain,

530
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:35,731
"which verges on truth...

531
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:39,777
"and manic time,

532
01:14:39,903 --> 01:14:42,780
"continues scattering dust,

533
01:14:42,906 --> 01:14:46,033
"and furious life bursts out in flames.

534
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:49,829
"Stay by my side

535
01:14:50,873 --> 01:14:52,623
"as I fade...

536
01:14:53,876 --> 01:14:57,169
"so you can point
to the end of my struggle...

537
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,134
"and the twilight...

538
01:15:06,013 --> 01:15:07,805
"of eternal days...

539
01:15:11,768 --> 01:15:15,104
"at the low, dark edge of life."

540
01:15:24,448 --> 01:15:25,948
Miss!

541
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,833
A grain of strength.

542
01:16:07,574 --> 01:16:09,116
Carlos, look.

543
01:16:14,122 --> 01:16:15,998
Dr Casares.

544
01:16:34,226 --> 01:16:36,268
That son of a bitch.

545
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:45,569
I should have killed him
when I had the chance.

546
01:16:45,696 --> 01:16:47,530
But he'll be back.

547
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,574
And I'll be here...

548
01:16:51,368 --> 01:16:53,327
...waiting for him.

549
01:16:55,372 --> 01:16:56,789
Carlitos...

550
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:02,712
Bring me my records, my music.

551
01:17:04,089 --> 01:17:06,799
I need them. All right?

552
01:17:42,419 --> 01:17:44,462
Are you hungry?

553
01:17:44,588 --> 01:17:47,173
"Eat beans, good for the heart.

554
01:17:47,299 --> 01:17:49,300
"The more you eat,
the more you fart."

555
01:17:51,803 --> 01:17:53,888
My stomach's all upset.

556
01:17:54,014 --> 01:17:56,766
But the little ones might be hungry.

557
01:18:03,315 --> 01:18:05,357
Could you kill someone?

558
01:18:08,487 --> 01:18:10,321
I could.

559
01:18:10,447 --> 01:18:14,075
What you said about Santi is true.
He's dead.

560
01:18:15,452 --> 01:18:18,079
But I didn't kill him.

561
01:18:18,205 --> 01:18:20,331
- I thought...
- I was with him.

562
01:18:22,501 --> 01:18:24,752
I saw everything.

563
01:18:25,587 --> 01:18:28,089
It started in the pit.

564
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:32,968
I dared him to come down with me
at night to gather slugs.

565
01:19:15,804 --> 01:19:17,847
Run, Jaime. Jacinto's here.

566
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:36,991
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

567
01:19:37,117 --> 01:19:38,993
- Did you see the safe?
- No.

568
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,750
Did you see the safe?

569
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:52,339
Why the fuck are you in here?

570
01:19:53,884 --> 01:19:55,426
Who was with you?

571
01:20:11,151 --> 01:20:16,071
Get up.

572
01:23:11,164 --> 01:23:13,499
<i>I was a coward.</i>

573
01:23:14,793 --> 01:23:17,544
<i>I was always afraid of Jacinto.</i>

574
01:23:19,339 --> 01:23:21,006
<i>Very afraid.</i>

575
01:23:21,716 --> 01:23:23,717
But not anymore.

576
01:23:26,805 --> 01:23:28,806
The next time I see him...

577
01:23:29,432 --> 01:23:31,392
I know I'm going to kill him.

578
01:24:05,885 --> 01:24:07,886
Look who's here.

579
01:24:11,433 --> 01:24:13,851
Let's see how he handles her.

580
01:24:22,694 --> 01:24:24,695
Say you're sorry and get in the car.

581
01:24:27,365 --> 01:24:29,450
I'm not scared of you.

582
01:24:29,576 --> 01:24:32,536
You're making me look like a fool.

583
01:24:32,662 --> 01:24:35,789
Say you're sorry.
They're looking at us.

584
01:24:38,751 --> 01:24:40,752
I'm not afraid of you.

585
01:24:50,847 --> 01:24:52,764
Say you're sorry.

586
01:24:58,521 --> 01:25:00,481
You're an animal.

587
01:25:56,704 --> 01:25:59,581
Doctor, I did what you told me.

588
01:25:59,707 --> 01:26:04,127
I did what you told me.
But Owl's wound is still bleeding.

589
01:26:06,256 --> 01:26:07,756
Conchita.

590
01:26:11,302 --> 01:26:13,387
Someone's coming.

591
01:26:15,807 --> 01:26:17,683
Someone's coming, Doctor!

592
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:20,769
Help me on my feet.

593
01:26:20,895 --> 01:26:22,896
Jaime, put on the record.

594
01:26:23,648 --> 01:26:26,483
Turn the horn towards the window.

595
01:26:51,092 --> 01:26:53,385
Didn't you say he was dead?

596
01:26:54,721 --> 01:26:56,013
Bastard!

597
01:26:58,433 --> 01:27:01,643
Nobody knows anything.
We're going to wait.

598
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:16,908
They're leaving.

599
01:27:29,881 --> 01:27:34,968
All my life I've always stopped short,
left things unfinished.

600
01:27:36,763 --> 01:27:40,098
I'm not going to leave you alone,
I promise you.

601
01:27:42,977 --> 01:27:45,937
I will never leave this place.

602
01:28:13,841 --> 01:28:16,009
We'll wait for you upstairs.

603
01:28:35,405 --> 01:28:37,447
I'm not going to run away.

604
01:28:38,908 --> 01:28:41,159
I want to talk to you.

605
01:28:51,963 --> 01:28:53,505
Nothing.

606
01:28:53,631 --> 01:28:55,799
They must have driven on.

607
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:24,578
Tell me, what do you want?

608
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:27,122
Jacinto.

609
01:29:31,335 --> 01:29:34,296
Bring him to me.

610
01:29:35,298 --> 01:29:37,215
I understand.

611
01:29:40,052 --> 01:29:42,220
I'm going to help you.

612
01:29:44,015 --> 01:29:47,434
Jaime! I saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!

613
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,578
I had to break
the old man's fingers.

614
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:10,665
Even dead, he's stubborn.

615
01:30:16,798 --> 01:30:18,840
Hurry up! Come on!

616
01:30:26,682 --> 01:30:28,433
There's something here!

617
01:30:28,559 --> 01:30:30,852
Marcelo! Out of the way!

618
01:30:37,193 --> 01:30:40,946
Fucking great.
It wasn't a complete waste of time.

619
01:30:51,082 --> 01:30:53,124
This is yours, isn't it?

620
01:31:38,462 --> 01:31:40,589
We have to get out of here.

621
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:49,806
One of us has to climb
through the window.

622
01:31:52,768 --> 01:31:54,519
And then open the door.

623
01:31:54,645 --> 01:31:56,897
And what then?

624
01:31:57,023 --> 01:32:00,609
What's wrong? You scared?

625
01:32:00,735 --> 01:32:04,529
Yes, I am, arsehole.
You're not wounded, like Owl is.

626
01:32:05,072 --> 01:32:08,074
You're not bleeding.
You're not even hurt.

627
01:32:09,368 --> 01:32:11,077
Santi is dead.

628
01:32:11,203 --> 01:32:13,121
Jacinto killed him.

629
01:32:14,415 --> 01:32:16,750
If we stay here, he'll kill us all.

630
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,713
Do you want to sit and wait?

631
01:32:21,839 --> 01:32:24,215
You think he'll let us go?

632
01:32:25,384 --> 01:32:28,136
That it'll all work out if we behave?

633
01:32:30,514 --> 01:32:35,060
They have the rifle.
They're bigger than us, and stronger.

634
01:32:41,984 --> 01:32:44,611
Yes, but there's more of us.

635
01:33:02,129 --> 01:33:03,672
Wait!

636
01:33:13,265 --> 01:33:16,226
Wait.
Check if they're still working.

637
01:33:25,277 --> 01:33:28,279
- Go on.
- All right.

638
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:45,088
Galvez, did you hurt yourself?

639
01:33:47,591 --> 01:33:49,175
A bit.

640
01:34:03,816 --> 01:34:06,693
Fuck! Look again!

641
01:34:07,903 --> 01:34:11,531
There's nothing here but souvenirs,
photographs! Just crap!

642
01:34:14,243 --> 01:34:16,786
One of us has to go out
and get Galvez.

643
01:34:17,663 --> 01:34:20,123
- Who'll do it?
- I'll go.

644
01:34:20,249 --> 01:34:23,877
No, not you. I'll go. I'm skinnier.

645
01:34:42,813 --> 01:34:44,814
Who opened it?

646
01:35:00,706 --> 01:35:03,041
Dr Casares opened the door.

647
01:35:06,045 --> 01:35:09,672
He said I'd be all right,
and that we should be brave.

648
01:35:20,059 --> 01:35:23,478
There's no fucking gold here.
You hear me?

649
01:35:24,188 --> 01:35:27,440
You and your fancy ideas. Fuck!

650
01:35:29,985 --> 01:35:31,820
Gold, gold... My arse!

651
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:41,287
My father.

652
01:35:41,413 --> 01:35:43,414
He was from Calanda.

653
01:35:44,834 --> 01:35:47,252
He was an accountant.
Quite elegant. Look.

654
01:35:50,798 --> 01:35:52,674
My mother was from Toledo.

655
01:35:54,301 --> 01:35:56,469
And that's me.

656
01:35:56,595 --> 01:35:58,930
It's blurred because I moved.

657
01:35:59,932 --> 01:36:01,474
But that's me.

658
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,726
We're leaving tomorrow.

659
01:36:03,853 --> 01:36:09,107
Pig, do you think your brother
in Portugal could put us up?

660
01:36:09,233 --> 01:36:11,359
We don't have much time.

661
01:36:16,448 --> 01:36:20,160
"How lonely,
the prince without a kingdom,

662
01:36:20,286 --> 01:36:22,745
"the man without warmth.

663
01:36:22,872 --> 01:36:25,748
"Jacinto, 1 925, in Malaga."

664
01:36:35,426 --> 01:36:37,552
I saw that gold.

665
01:36:37,678 --> 01:36:39,262
It's here.

666
01:36:39,388 --> 01:36:41,389
We just have to look for it.

667
01:36:45,853 --> 01:36:48,479
We'll find it,
and tomorrow we'll burn everything.

668
01:36:48,606 --> 01:36:51,816
- And the boys?
- They've got no parents.

669
01:36:51,942 --> 01:36:54,903
They've got no one.
Who'll miss them?

670
01:36:57,573 --> 01:36:59,407
We're at war.

671
01:37:00,451 --> 01:37:03,203
A drop in the ocean.

672
01:37:06,749 --> 01:37:08,082
Look, Jacinto.

673
01:37:08,209 --> 01:37:11,002
Burn the place, kill the kids,
I don't give a shit.

674
01:37:11,545 --> 01:37:14,422
But we're getting out of here tomorrow.

675
01:37:32,358 --> 01:37:35,109
- We need stuff from the car.
- Hurry up.

676
01:37:36,237 --> 01:37:38,029
I'll need a hand.

677
01:37:40,074 --> 01:37:41,908
Come on, Pig.

678
01:38:28,998 --> 01:38:30,790
You're crazy, arsehole!

679
01:38:31,542 --> 01:38:33,501
Fuck you!

680
01:38:35,129 --> 01:38:37,839
No, fuck you! It's all for me.

681
01:39:08,495 --> 01:39:10,538
Son of a bitch!

682
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:08,805
What a joke!

683
01:40:24,405 --> 01:40:26,406
Galvez, you go over there.

684
01:40:37,376 --> 01:40:39,710
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle!

685
01:40:59,022 --> 01:41:00,565
Santi...

686
01:42:44,169 --> 01:42:46,504
<i>What is a ghost?</i>

687
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:50,633
<i>A tragedy condemned</i>
<i>to repeat itself time and again?</i>

688
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:55,596
<i>A moment of pain, perhaps.</i>

689
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:06,148
<i>Something dead</i>
<i>which still seems to be alive.</i>

690
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:13,281
<i>An emotion suspended in time.</i>

691
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:23,874
<i>Like a blurred photograph.</i>

692
01:43:33,635 --> 01:43:36,470
<i>Like an insect trapped in amber.</i>

693
01:43:52,529 --> 01:43:54,155
<i>A ghost.</i>

694
01:43:55,032 --> 01:43:57,033
<i>That's what I am.</i>

695
01:44:05,459 --> 01:44:07,585
TO MY PARENTS

696
01:44:08,305 --> 01:45:08,325
