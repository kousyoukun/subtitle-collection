GEORGE: Since the dawn
of recorded history,

2
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:47,236
something like 1 10 billion human beings
have been born into this world.

3
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,780
And not a single one of them made it.

4
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,749
There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.

5
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,288
Roughly 60 million of them die
every year. 60 million people.

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,850
That comes out to about 160,000 per day.

7
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,622
l read this quote once when l was a kid,

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,169
''We live alone, we die alone.
Everything else is just an illusion. ''

9
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,505
lt used to keep me up at night.

10
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,137
We all die alone.

11
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,303
So, why am l supposed to spend my life
working, sweating, struggling?

12
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,636
For an illusion?

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,607
Because no amount of friends,

14
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,641
no girl,

15
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,650
no assignments
about conjugating the pluperfect

16
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,589
or determining the square root
of the hypotenuse

17
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,592
is gonna help me avoid my fate.

18
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,224
l have better things to do with my time.

19
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,365
(ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG)

20
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,415
l've got a cupboard with cans of food

21
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,227
Filtered water and pictures of you

22
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,325
And l'm not coming out until this is all over

23
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,762
And l'm looking through the glass

24
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,233
Where the light bends at the cracks

25
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,645
And l'm screaming at the top of my lungs

26
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:32,116
Pretending the echoes belong to someone

27
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,251
Someone l used to know

28
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,664
And we become

29
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,638
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go

30
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,993
Do you have your work, George?

31
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,230
-No.
-Why not?

32
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,201
-l was depressed.
-(STUDENTS CHUCKLE)

33
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,536
Oh, yes? Why was that?

34
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,210
Because l realized l'm gonna die one day.

35
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,679
We're all gonna die one day, George.

36
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
l don't think that's a reasonable excuse

37
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,683
for not completing
your trigonometry exercise.

38
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,448
Well, l was trying to.

39
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,591
l just couldn't shake
this awareness of my mortality.

40
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,390
Everything seemed meaningless,

41
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,253
-including the assignment, unfortunately.
-(STUDENTS LAUGH)

42
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,196
l want you to go to the principal's office

43
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,598
and find meaning in the homework.

44
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,137
Bring it to me completed
by the end of the period.

45
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,959
-You're late.
-l was so engrossed in my work.

46
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,152
Boy, l wouldn't wanna be you right now.

47
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,731
-l haven't done anything.
-You've always done something.

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,169
You better go.

49
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,836
Bill.

50
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,640
Even though you have
off-campus privileges as a senior,

51
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,978
if you are seen
anywhere in the city smoking,

52
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,142
you have your privileges revoked.
Automatic probation.

53
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,847
Why are you telling me?

54
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,523
-You think l can't smell?
-You can smell all you want.

55
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,259
Shall we get down to business?

56
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,717
Yes, we shall.

57
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,864
ln a way, your future depends
on the next few months.

58
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,957
Not just for college.

59
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,004
l mean, it sets the tone
for everything that follows.

60
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,239
Now, l know how you think and l know

61
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,901
you're thinking it's too late
and you're gonna be a fatalist

62
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,409
and let it all go to hell.

63
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,876
But, George, if you keep performing
the way you are,

64
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,917
forget about college,
forget about graduating, even.

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,409
So,

66
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,119
this counts as your official warning.
Suspension is next.

67
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,523
l thought probation was next.

68
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,989
Don't play the angles, George.
They won't work.

69
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,225
Neither do jokes.

70
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,323
l wasn't joking.

71
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,627
l know you're capable.

72
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,032
l have a real problem with motivating.

73
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,206
But l think l can do it.

74
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,871
l'll try.

75
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,074
All right, go.

76
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,411
And don't make me regret it.

77

DOUGHERTY:
Who's smoking up here?

78
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,481
George! What do you think you're doing?

79
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,194
Sorry. l...

80
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,395
l was having a tough day.

81
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,557
l guess the stress finally got to me,
Mrs. Dougherty.

82
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,896
George, why do you do these things?

83
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,632
(MOUTHlNG) Thank you.

84
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,434
Now, what do you mean by stress?

85
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,985
-Hi.
-Hi.

86
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:09,796
-l got an e-mail from your school.
-Oh, Jesus.

87
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,697
-l got an e-mail from your school.
-Oh, Jesus.

88
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,532
Some kind of academic probation?

89
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,465
Can l help you?

90
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:24,134
Can l get you a tutor
or a private college advisor?

91
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,607
lf you don't get into a decent school,

92
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,581
then l don't know
how you're gonna get a job.

93
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,208
l have it under control.

94
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,950
Honey, if you don't get into
a decent college...

95
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,515
-l'm gonna go watch TV.
-No, you will not watch TV.

96
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,855
You will stay here

97
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,159
till we can come up with a plan
for getting you into college.

98
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,994
l had a hard day at school, l'm tired,

99
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,728
and l'm gonna go relax now
for half an hour.

100
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,073
Then l will do my work. Okay?

101
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,647
HARRlS: George?

102
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,810
The fuck are you doing?

103
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,146
l'm drawing.

104
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,953
Are you sketching your subject,
you little shit?

105
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,627
Yes.

106
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,631
-l don't have a subject, Harris.
-Why the heck not?

107
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,739
l don't know.

108
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,468
George, you're going to have to start
digging around in there,

109
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,601
so you can develop that talent of yours,

110
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,010
so you can start to use that brain of yours

111
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,378
to express that beautiful heart of yours.

112
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,982
So, figure out what you want to say,
and say it.

113
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,145
-Harris.
-Yes.

114
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,087
l don't have anything to say.

115
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,162
(SHOUTlNG) Find something!

116
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,875
-Hey.
-Hey.

117
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,740
-l'm Sally.
-l know.

118
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,315
Thanks for covering for me.

119
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,509
No problem.

120
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,779
Why did you?

121
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,512
l don't know.

122
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,157
You were doing something so renegade,

123
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,691
l thought you deserved to get away with it.

124
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,623
l run afoul of the authorities so often,

125
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,289
l figured l could handle it better than you.

126
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,496
You're really weird.

127
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,607
SALLY: So, why don't you ever
do your work?

128
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,766
There are so many more important things
to think about,

129
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,311
homework ends up seeming like
an afterthought.

130
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,507
ADD?

131
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,446
No, they tried everything.

132
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,314
Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy.

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,218
Nothing worked. l'm the Teflon slacker.

134
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,216
No, it's more like,
we're living in a dying time, you know?

135
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,094
l mean, you got global warming, wars,
terrorism, tsunamis.

136
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,258
-Okay...
-We're definitely on the downhill side.

137
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,299
So, what are we working towards?
What's the point?

138
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,037
l thought l had fears,
but they're pretty run-of-the-mill.

139
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,041
-Pain, death.
-Not me.

140
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,006
l fear life.

141
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,101
(LAUGHS )

142
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,973
Do you have any friends, George?

143
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,944
l'm kind of a misanthrope.

144
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,719
Not a choice, just a fact.

145
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,764
Okay, handsome.

146
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,536
Mom ! Jesus!

147
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,278
Hi, banana !

148
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,679
You wanna come up?

149
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,423
l'm sorry about that, chicken.
We had a really late night.

150
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,551
l think we got home right before
you left for school.

151
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,192
Mom, this is my new friend, George.

152
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,665
-Well, George.
-Hello, Mrs. Howe.

153
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,396
-What a genuine pleasure.
-Very nice to...

154
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,596
Sally, do you know
where our stemware went?

155
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,832
l'm drinking wine out of a tumbler.

156
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,363
What do you want, George?

157
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,803
CHARLOTTE: And this was before
we left the sticks.

158
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,971
So, l cock one eye, look down,

159
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,877
expecting to see a giant water bug,

160
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,681

Hey.

321
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,313
My name is Dustin Heath.

322
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
l'm a student. l was a student here.

323
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,717
l was in the class
with that terrifying old man over there.

324
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,653
Yeah, l'm an artist.

325
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,547
Honestly, l don't know what l'm doing here.

326
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,150
Was a little hungover when they
called me and asked me to do this

327
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,321
and l said yes
just to get them off the phone.

328
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,729
l got the schedule in the mail
several days later

329
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,391
and l was a little embarrassed.

330
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,096
l'm not really established or anything.

331
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,600
l had my first art show a year ago,
which was good.

332
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,974
Got me this coat.

333
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,117
Well, let me show you
some of my work here.

334
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,813
l don't know,
sometimes people look at your stuff

335
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,085
and, you know,
they think it's really interesting

336
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,558
or they think it's bullshit,

337
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,755
and l don't know the difference.
l honestly don't.

338

You just, you know, hope not to be
fooling yourself, l guess.

Anybody have any questions?

341
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,646
l mean, nobody asked me any questions.
Did l just suck?

342

You were probably the only real,
non-full-of-shit person speaking today.

Yeah, l'd like to.

348
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,260
l just don't know what to paint.

349
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,730
Yeah, well, it's the hardest part, you know?

350
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,002
Does that make me not a painter?

351
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,100
The fact that you struggle with it
is a really good thing.

352
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,240
But how can you call yourself a painter
if you don't paint?

-Not really.

l called this meeting because
your teachers have reported to me

l'm giving you a choice.

710
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:46,102
First is expulsion.

711
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,373

Second option,

713
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:55,181
if you want to graduate, you make up
every single assignment you missed.

714

Every paper, every exercise.

715
00:53:57,087 --> 00:54:00,318
Essentially, a year's worth of homework.

716
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:05,327
lf even one is missing
on graduation day, no diploma.

717

You have a little over three weeks.

718

more potential than anyone else here.

719

720

l wasn't gonna waste the time
getting mad at you.

721
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,735
l'm not gonna waste the time
defending you now.

what goes on around here.

725

Why would we continue to reward that?

726
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:46,468
You're right.

727
00:54:47,604 --> 00:54:48,969
You shouldn't reward it.

729
