1
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,415
? I've got a cupboard with cans of food ?

2
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,227
? Filtered water and pictures of you ?

3
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,325
? And I'm not coming out until this is all over ?

4
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,762
? And I'm looking through the glass ?

5
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,233
? Where the light bends at the cracks?

6
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,645
? And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs ?

7
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:32,116
? Pretending the echoes belong to someone ?

8
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,251
? Someone I used to know ?

9
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,664
? And we become ?

10
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,638
? Silhouettes when our bodies finally go ?

11
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,564
Since the dawn of recorded history,

12
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,411
something like 110 billion

13
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:47,236
human beings have been born into this world.

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,780
And not a single one of them made it.

15
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,749
There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.

16
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,288
Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people.

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,850
That comes out to about 160,000 per day.

18
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,622
I read this quote once when I was a kid,

19
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,652
"We live alone, we die alone.

20
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:10,169
Everything else is just an illusion. "

21
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,505
It used to keep me up at night.

22
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,137
We all die alone.

23
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,675
So, why am I supposed to

24
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:20,303
spend my life working, sweating, struggling?

25
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,636
For an illusion?

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,607
Because no amount of friends,

27
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,641
no girl,

28
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,650
no assignments about conjugating the pluperfect

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,589
or determining the square root of the hypotenuse

30
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,592
is gonna help me avoid my fate.

31
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,224
I have better things to do with my time.

32
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,993
Do you have your work, George?

33
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,230
- No. - Why not?

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,201
I was depressed.

35
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,536
Oh, yes? Why was that?

36
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,210
Because I realized I'm gonna die one day.

37
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,679
We're all gonna die one day, George.

38
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
I don't think that's a reasonable excuse

39
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,683
for not completing your trigonometry exercise.

40
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,448
Well, I was trying to.

41
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,591
I just couldn't shake this awareness of my mortality.

42
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,390
Everything seemed meaningless,

43
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,253
including the assignment, unfortunately.

44
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,196
I want you to go to the principal's office

45
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,598
and find meaning in the homework.

46
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,137
Bring it to me completed by the end of the period.

47
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,959
- You're late. - I was so engrossed in my work.

48
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,152
Boy, I wouldn't wanna be you right now.

49
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,731
- I haven't done anything. - You've always done something.

50
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,169
You better go.

51
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,836
Bill.

52
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,640
Even though you have off-campus privileges as a senior,

53
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,978
if you are seen anywhere in the city smoking,

54
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,142
you have your privileges revoked. Automatic probation.

55
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,847
Why are you telling me?

56
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,523
- You think I can't smell? - You can smell all you want.

57
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,259
Shall we get down to business?

58
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,717
Yes, we shall.

59
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,864
In a way, your future depends on the next few months.

60
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,957
Not just for college.

61
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,004
I mean, it sets the tone for everything that follows.

62
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,239
Now, I know how you think and I know

63
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,901
you're thinking it's too late and you're gonna be a fatalist

64
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,409
and let it all go to hell.

65
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,876
But, George, if you keep performing the way you are,

66
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,917
forget about college, forget about graduating, even.

67
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,409
So,

68
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,119
this counts as your official warning. Suspension is next.

69
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,523
I thought probation was next.

70
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,989
Don't play the angles, George. They won't work.

71
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,225
Neither do jokes.

72
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,323
I wasn't joking.

73
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,627
I know you're capable.

74
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,032
I have a real problem with motivating.

75
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,206
But I think I can do it.

76
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,871
I'll try.

77
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,074
All right, go.

78
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,411
And don't make me regret it.

79
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,844
Who's smoking up here?

80
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,481
George! What do you think you're doing?

81
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,194
Sorry. I...

82
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,395
I was having a tough day.

83
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,557
I guess the stress finally got to me, Mrs. Dougherty.

84
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,896
George, why do you do these things?

85
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,632
Thank you.

86
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,434
Now, what do you mean by stress?

87
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,985
- Hi. - Hi.

88
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,697
- I got an e-mail from your school. - Oh, Jesus.

89
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,532
Some kind of academic probation?

90
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,465
Can I help you?

91
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:24,134
Can I get you a tutor or a private college advisor?

92
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,607
If you don't get into a decent school,

93
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,581
then I don't know how you're gonna get a job.

94
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,208
I have it under control.

95
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,950
Honey, if you don't get into a decent college...

96
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,515
- I'm gonna go watch TV. - No, you will not watch TV.

97
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,855
You will stay here

98
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,159
till we can come up with a plan for getting you into college.

99
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,994
I had a hard day at school, I'm tired,

100
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,728
and I'm gonna go relax now for half an hour.

101
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,073
Then I will do my work. Okay?

102
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,647
George?

103
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,810
The fuck are you doing?

104
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,146
I'm drawing.

105
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,953
Are you sketching your subject, you little shit?

106
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,627
Yes.

107
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,631
- I don't have a subject, Harris. - Why the heck not?

108
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,739
I don't know.

109
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,468
George, you're going to have to start digging around in there,

110
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,601
so you can develop that talent of yours,

111
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,010
so you can start to use that brain of yours

112
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,378
to express that beautiful heart of yours.

113
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,982
So, figure out what you want to say, and say it.

114
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,145
- Harris. - Yes.

115
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,087
I don't have anything to say.

116
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,162
Find something!

117
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,875
- Hey. - Hey.

118
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,740
- I'm Sally. - I know.

119
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,315
Thanks for covering for me.

120
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,509
No problem.

121
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,779
Why did you?

122
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,512
I don't know.

123
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,157
You were doing something so renegade,

124
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,691
I thought you deserved to get away with it.

125
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,623
I run afoul of the authorities so often,

126
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,289
I figured I could handle it better than you.

127
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,496
You're really weird.

128
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,607
So, why don't you ever do your work?

129
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,766
There are so many more important things to think about,

130
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,311
homework ends up seeming like an afterthought.

131
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,507
Add?

132
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,446
No, they tried everything.

133
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,314
Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy.

134
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,218
Nothing worked. I'm the Teflon slacker.

135
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,216
No, it's more like, we're living in a dying time, you know?

136
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,094
I mean, you got global warming, wars, terrorism, tsunamis.

137
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,258
- Okay... - We're definitely on the downhill side.

138
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,299
So, what are we working towards? What's the point?

139
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,037
I thought I had fears, but they're pretty run-of-the-mill.

140
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,041
- Pain, death. - Not me.

141
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,006
I fear life.

142
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,973
Do you have any friends, George?

143
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,944
I'm kind of a misanthrope.

144
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,719
Not a choice, just a fact.

145
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,764
Okay, handsome.

146
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,536
Mom! Jesus!

147
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,278
Hi, banana!

148
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,679
You wanna come up?

149
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,423
I'm sorry about that, chicken. We had a really late night.

150
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,551
I think we got home right before you left for school.

151
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,192
Mom, this is my new friend, George.

152
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,665
- Well, George. - Hello, Mrs. Howe.

153
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,396
- What a genuine pleasure. - Very nice to...

154
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,596
Sally, do you know where our stemware went?

155
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,832
I'm drinking wine out of a tumbler.

156
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,363
What do you want, George?

157
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,803
And this was before we left the sticks.

158
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,971
So, I cock one eye, look down,

159
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,877
expecting to see a giant water bug,

160
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,681
or a water moccasin, or...

161
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,316
Water something. Something I had to kill.

162
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,621
But it was the pilot's hand!

163
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,695
Oh!

164
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,996
Ticklish, this one!

165
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,234
Let me get you a paper towel.

166
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,537
You know, ticklish people make great lovers.

167
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,601
Everything is erogenous.

168
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,206
My God. She's amazing.

169
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,407
Not if you're her daughter.

170
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,608
How'd you end up in New York?

171
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,019
My mom had me when she was 16. My dad was a truck driver,

172
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,387
and one day he took off and never came back.

173
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,959
And this was?

174
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,654
Clarksburg. It's a small town in Tennessee.

175
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,996
This rich guy from New York, who owned a textile plant,

176
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,155
started coming down, and it

177
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:20,733
was like we were castaways and he was the ship.

178
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,499
But I ended up here,

179
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:29,047
eight years old, new school, new friends, fancy new clothes.

180
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,440
My mom divorced him a year ago,

181
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,610
and now she's back on the singles scene with a vengeance.

182
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,684
I do think I should get some homework done, though.

183
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,522
I should get going then. Got work to do myself.

184
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,499
Yeah, right.

185
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,401
Thank you.

186
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,704
Goodbye.

187
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,142
It's not the first time it's happened.

188
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,609
I know.

189
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,214
But you never think it's gonna be the people that it's gonna be.

190
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,974
They've been together for 15 years.

191
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:39,682
I know. It's certainly ridiculous.

192
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,151
- What happened to the electricity? - Hi, sweetie.

193
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,882
We got take-out from the rotisserie chicken place.

194
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,252
Grab a plate and join us.

195
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,349
But the lights. What happened?

196
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,827
It's my fault. I forgot to pay the bill.

197
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,831
And it's no big deal. They'll be on tomorrow.

198
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,662
George, we're trying to turn

199
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,670
this awkward little mix-up into a fun experience.

200
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,468
And if you can't get into the spirit of adventure,

201
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,384
then you can just do your own thing.

202
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,942
You don't have to stick around.

203
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,842
I'm sorry, Jack. I can't use my laptop,

204
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,847
much less get my assignments.

205
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,544
So, go to the library or Starbucks. Be resourceful.

206
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,700
Does anyone have any ideas about

207
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,376
which elements of the novel

208
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:34,000
pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?

209
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,409
Anyone?

210
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,035
George?

211
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,881
George?

212
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,606
Yeah?

213
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,297
I was asking what conclusion

214
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:50,553
you came to in the exercise we're doing.

215
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,223
Sorry. About what, again?

216
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,159
About which elements of the novel

217
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,627
pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?

218
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,126
Which novel?

219
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,310
The Mayor of Casterbridge,

220
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:10,903
George, which, obviously, you didn't read.

221
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,238
I loved it.

222
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,744
Clearly. Anyone else?

223
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,106
My favorite part of the

224
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,981
book is how the town's layout is described

225
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,572
from the perspective of a bee

226
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,883
traveling from one side of town to the other.

227
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,320
It's so visual.

228
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,558
So, I guess what Hardy's doing is aligning his point of view

229
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,925
not with an all-seeing God but with an insect,

230
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,021
the tiniest, humblest creature in nature.

231
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,695
Which is pretty Romantic.

232
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,797
I think you just found your term paper, George.

233
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,445
George!

234
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,520
Hi.

235
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,654
- Come join us. - Cool.

236
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,952
You know Will and Zoe, right?

237
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,258
Yeah, we're in math class together, right?

238
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,164
You never have your homework.

239
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,169
Right. Right, it's my shtick.

240
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,707
- Hi, George. - Hey, Zoe.

241
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,241
Dude, what are you always drawing?

242
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,176
He's like the mad artist, just hunched over his books.

243
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,871
He never listens to a word the teacher says.

244
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,779
- What, like you do? - Can I see some of the shit you draw?

245
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,952
Yeah, sure.

246
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,261
You have issues.

247
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,324
No. Dude, you're sensitive.

248
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,900
The sensitive artiste.

249
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,270
Could you draw something like this for one of my parties?

250
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,931
I'm throwing a huge one at my brother's club on New Year's Eve.

251
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,564
- You serious? - Yeah.

252
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,405
You know, we can blow it up, make it a poster, invites, flyers.

253
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,845
Yeah, that'd be great, right?

254
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,359
- Hey, George. How are you? - Fine.

255
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,236
Well, what are you doing?

256
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,230
Just finishing my trig assignment.

257
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,600
Good man. That's what I like to hear.

258
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,464
I've got 72 comps on my list alone.

259
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,530
- Most of them are your friends. - Yeah.

260
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,737
And they're gonna be the coolest people there.

261
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,203
- Yeah, you're right. - So don't question it.

262
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,673
Besides, if I pull my people, your whole operation goes under.

263
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,302
- Will. - Brother George!

264
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,079
I love it, man.

265
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,752
Nice celebratory mood. Perfect for a party.

266
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,283
So, what now, Basquiat?

267
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,453
Rule number one about cutting school.

268
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,032
I've cut school before.

269
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,566
To shop.

270
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,169
- Rule number one, cutting school is fun. - That's a rule?

271
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,966
Rule number two, cut rarely to preserve the specialness.

272
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,770
Is that even a word?

273
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,401
Rule number three,

274
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,632
do something culturally

275
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,777
rewarding with your time to earn it morally.

276
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,440
Rule number four, you're a dork.

277
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,949
Wrong. Rule number four, noodles.

278
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,652
Noodles?

279
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:04,939
Is that how you see us?

280
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,542
You're the old man and I'm your 12-year-old niece?

281
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,204
No.

282
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,621
So, what, you take all the

283
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:12,875
girls to this movie? Is it your secret weapon?

284
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,144
When you're cutting school, you go to whatever's playing.

285
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,688
I'm kidding.

286
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,714
- Whoa. - What?

287
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,993
- That's my stepfather. - So?

288
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,892
Well, A, his office is on the other side of town.

289
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,023
And B, he looks weird.

290
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,161
Let's follow him.

291
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,264
What do you think he's doing?

292
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:38,098
Probably just going to a meeting.

293
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,073
I bet it's a lovers' rendezvous.

294
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:42,112
My stepfather cheated all the time.

295
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,371
Maybe.

296
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,486
No offense, but he looks kind of creepy.

297
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,458
Strange place for a meeting.

298
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,998
Lovers' rendezvous amended to

299
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,606
drug buy from skanky hooker.

300
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,112
Hey, Bill.

301
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,813
You are like a Cold War spy. You move only in shadow.

302
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,980
Me? I'm always around.

303
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,590
I see you made some new friends.

304
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,957
Not necessarily. Jury's still out.

305
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,997
I'm happy for you, George. I just...

306
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,123
I just want you to be careful.

307
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,263
- What's wrong with them? - Nothing.

308
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:41,199
But they have an easier time of getting by than you do.

309
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,570
You're not exactly hooking up with a study group.

310
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,590
Hey, I have something for you.

311
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,906
Career Day is coming up in a few weeks,

312
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,448
and we always assign an exemplary student

313
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,746
to represent Morgan to the alumni speakers.

314
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,934
You know, to act as a liaison,

315
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,413
escort them to the classroom, whatever...

316
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,023
You have really lost it.

317
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,922
Then there is that matter that Mrs. Dougherty broached to me.

318
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,324
- The substitute? - Yeah.

319
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,886
Smoking on campus is automatic suspension.

320
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,765
This is the last thing I wanna do.

321
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,601
No problem. Suspension it is. Done. Effective...

322
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,729
Fine. Fine.

323
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,741
- I'll do it. - Great. Great.

324
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,868
We'll be sending out an e-mail

325
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,404
with your schedule and your responsibilities.

326
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,762
Are you Dustin?

327
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,905
Yeah.

328
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,699
Hi. I'm George. I'm your liaison.

329
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,606
Hey.

330
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,313
My name is Dustin Heath.

331
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
I'm a student. I was a student here.

332
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,717
I was in the class with that terrifying old man over there.

333
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,653
Yeah, I'm an artist.

334
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,547
Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing here.

335
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,150
Was a little hungover when they called me and asked me to do this

336
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,321
and I said yes just to get them off the phone.

337
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,729
I got the schedule in the mail several days later

338
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,391
and I was a little embarrassed.

339
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,096
I'm not really established or anything.

340
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,600
I had my first art show a year ago, which was good.

341
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,974
Got me this coat.

342
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,117
Well, let me show you some of my work here.

343
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,813
I don't know, sometimes people look at your stuff

344
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,085
and, you know, they think it's really interesting

345
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,558
or they think it's bullshit,

346
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,755
and I don't know the difference. I honestly don't.

347
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,931
You just, you know, hope not to be fooling yourself, I guess.

348
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,837
This is the next slide, here.

349
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,940
Anybody have any questions?

350
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,646
I mean, nobody asked me any questions. Did I just suck?

351
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,770
You were probably the only real,

352
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,708
non-full-of-shit person speaking today.

353
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,752
It felt like Nagasaki in there.

354
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,321
You were great.

355
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,523
Thanks, man.

356
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,621
Do you paint?

357
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,524
Yeah, I'd like to.

358
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,260
I just don't know what to paint.

359
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,730
Yeah, well, it's the hardest part, you know?

360
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,002
Does that make me not a painter?

361
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,100
The fact that you struggle with it is a really good thing.

362
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,240
But how can you call yourself a painter if you don't paint?

363
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,714
- You like Morgan? - Not really.

364
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,484
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

365
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,558
I don't think anybody does, George.

366
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,623
At least you admit it.

367
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,012
If you want, you can come to

368
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:56,893
my studio in Brooklyn and check some stuff out.

369
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,465
You sticking around for the holidays?

370
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,577
Nah. St. Bart's. Family yacht.

371
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,679
Oh.

372
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,275
Kidding. No plans.

373
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,116
You're a loser.

374
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,854
Well, me, too. We should hang out.

375
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,288
Maybe.

376
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,127
Merry Christmas!

377
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,108
- Hi. - Hey.

378
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,805
Should we come in?

379
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,748
Please.

380
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,750
Hi.

381
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,128
These are amazing. How long did they take?

382
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,992
They're all kind of different, you know?

383
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,359
Each one goes through its

384
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,166
own little process of death and rebirth.

385
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,528
That one literally took me two hours.

386
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,334
They're all their own little entities, really.

387
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,310
- You live here, too? - Mm-hmm.

388
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,980
It's so simple.

389
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,310
It's not about comfort, really, you know?

390
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,751
You... How old are you?

391
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,256
18.

392
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,158
No.

393
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,499
Every time I think about a subject,

394
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,626
or even try to visualize an image of what I think I should paint,

395
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,262
I just feel like I'm full of shit,

396
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,603
like I'm trying to be something I'm not.

397
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,336
George, this is who you are.

398
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,004
This stuff is wonderful, man. It really is. It's fantastic.

399
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,742
Really? No, they're just doodles, you know, immature crap.

400
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,045
No, man. This is what you should be painting.

401
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,146
At least until you evolve

402
00:26:29,147 --> 00:26:30,815
into something else, you know what I mean?

403
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,390
But you gotta exercise the muscle

404
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,527
even if you're not feeling it, you know what I mean?

405
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,188
You just... You gotta do it or else it'll never happen.

406
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,462
Hey, man, by the way,

407
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,437
very nice work.

408
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,671
- Huh? - Very nice work.

409
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,475
Oh.

410
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,339
Well, you guys are together, right?

411
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,679
No.

412
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,545
I'm sorry. That was stupid. I shouldn't have said anything.

413
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:04,853
No, not at all. We're not together.

414
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,489
You like her.

415
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,818
You should like her, if you don't.

416
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,856
I'll leave that alone.

417
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,098
- That was so cool. - Uh-huh.

418
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,701
I mean, he's amazing. Really talented. Don't you think?

419
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,975
A little derivative. I'm not sure he's the real deal.

420
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,215
Really? He seemed like it to me.

421
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:35,416
I mean, he's a mentor to you now.

422
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,489
- Aren't you psyched? - I think he's a bit of a blowhard.

423
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,057
You're so weird.

424
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,353
Did he say anything about me?

425
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,727
Nope.

426
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,071
- Did you read the Book Review? - Mmm-hmm.

427
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,339
New book about the M-1 tank. Can't wait.

428
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,505
What about you?

429
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,809
I'm interested in...

430
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,852
- Great job. - Thank you.

431
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,829
Thanks. I appreciate it.

432
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,399
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

433
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,074
What happened?

434
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,080
I don't wanna lose this!

435
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,052
Viv, we're not gonna lose this place. I promise you.

436
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,680
- I don't believe you anymore. - He's gonna come through.

437
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,692
- No! - Yes, he's gonna come through,

438
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,885
and I have two other guys...

439
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,088
It's always some other person, it's always some other thing.

440
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,255
I'm tired of this!

441
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,341
Hey!

442
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,552
- What? - Nothing.

443
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,324
You okay?

444
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,719
I'm allergic to hormones.

445
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,591
What hormones?

446
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,063
Mine.

447
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:43,298
- Hi, George! - Hey, Zoe. Great place.

448
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,737
Your folks getting dinner at the soup kitchen?

449
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,837
No, they don't live here. They live in Greenwich.

450
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,505
- You live here alone? - Yes, George.

451
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,984
I wanted to go to school in the city,

452
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,279
so my parents rented me this place.

453
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,088
Hey, Nick.

454
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,090
Looking pretty hot, Sal.

455
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,252
Thanks.

456
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,262
I think we need some one-on-one time, you and me.

457
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,866
Oh, you do, do you?

458
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,530
Zinavoy, what's with the overcoat?

459
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,271
We're indoors now.

460
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,274
I like layers.

461
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,374
- Did you see it, man? - See what?

462
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,075
The invite. Check it out.

463
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,358
Bang!

464
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,794
It's pretty solid, huh?

465
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,393
All right, y'all. Let's go to the club.

466
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,905
I'm not dressed for this.

467
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,447
You're fine. And we're with Will.

468
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,312
It's not a big deal, but I've never been to one of these before.

469
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,616
Don't worry. I won't lose you.

470
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,254
- Hey! - Hey, guys.

471
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,156
This is yours, for the drawing. Dominate it.

472
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,660
Thanks.

473
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,126
Come on!

474
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,338
Come on.

475
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,654
- Nick is here! - Hey!

476
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,663
Sorry.

477
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,686
Hi.

478
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,724
Do you want me to introduce you to any girls?

479
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,854
What?

480
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,661
I have a lot of slutty friends here you might like.

481
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,497
Oh, no. No, I'm cool.

482
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,665
I mean, I'm cool just hanging out.

483
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,674
That's all right, George. We all know who you're waiting for.

484
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,938
What? No. I'm not.

485
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,617
- Zoe, that's not what I... - Bye-bye!

486
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,854
Yeah, yeah!

487
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:36,869
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

488
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,670
four, three, two, one!

489
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,745
Happy New Year!

490
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,933
Hey.

491
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,044
Why didn't you go with Nick?

492
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,910
Why would I? I spent two hours in there looking for you.

493
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:24,484
- Didn't you used to date him? - Yeah, for like five minutes.

494
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,955
Why do you like that guy?

495
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,390
I don't! I would tell you if I did.

496
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,727
I'm so sorry.

497
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,964
Sally, I'm so sorry. I ruined your night.

498
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:41,126
No, I'm sorry. I lost you.

499
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,430
Broke my promise.

500
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,942
I think you're

501
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,941
amazing.

502
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,042
What a stupid thing to say.

503
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,753
No. No, it was...

504
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,291
It was sweet.

505
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:04,583
Come on.

506
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,231
Careful.

507
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,312
This is the cure to end all cures.

508
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,320
My daddy used to put a raw egg in his to really get the effects.

509
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,287
- You want an egg? - No.

510
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,158
You've heard of a hair of the dog?

511
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,029
Beef bouillon floater there.

512
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,201
How are you feeling?

513
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,928
Much better. Thank you for taking care of me.

514
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,405
Mom, what are you doing?

515
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,771
But you have to have a coalminer's tonic, Miss Grumpy.

516
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,606
It's like a vaccine.

517
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,605
I can't deal. I'm going back to bed.

518
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,487
Angrier than a pit bull when she wakes up.

519
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,375
I like that boy.

520
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,814
So do I.

521
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,750
Sal, I don't think you should be messing around with him.

522
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,448
Are you giving me dating advice?

523
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,123
I just think you should be going out with someone your own speed.

524
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,887
Don't worry, we're just friends.

525
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,497
That's exactly what worries me.

526
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,602
Charlotte, I don't comment on your social life.

527
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,068
You hardly have the right to comment on mine.

528
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,800
- I've seen the way he looks at you. - Jesus.

529
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,669
This all means something much more to him.

530
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,445
Trust me, I've played with their affections my whole life.

531
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,045
But with the good ones, it's not right.

532
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,823
That's what you do. It's not what I'm doing.

533
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,733
This is a great idea, by the way.

534
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,036
I got a show coming up in a couple of months.

535
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,163
I needed some inspiration, you know?

536
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,332
Big time.

537
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,505
Do you like this?

538
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,977
I get it. Do you?

539
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,116
I think anyone could turn this out,

540
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,776
except why would they want to?

541
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,283
What's it saying?

542
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,910
Makes a room look great, though, you know?

543
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,154
It looks like money.

544
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,728
Oh, God.

545
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,360
This is heaven to me.

546
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,269
Pretty great.

547
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,764
This makes you feel something instantly, you know what I mean?

548
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,137
Like anger

549
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,143
or wrath.

550
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,145
Lust.

551
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,721
So, how's it going with our friend Sally? Make any moves?

552
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,227
She hasn't shown any interest.

553
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,691
Well, have you?

554
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,869
What do you think, she's

555
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,098
gonna go around wearing a sign around her neck?

556
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,532
Women love being desired.

557
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,299
You just go throw her up against the wall, start kissing her.

558
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,499
Chances are she'll kiss you back.

559
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,169
And if she doesn't, then at least you tried.

560
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:00,542
You gotta do something or you might lose her.

561
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,527
You love this.

562
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,169
No, it's good.

563
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:27,004
Fetishizing an object. That suits you.

564
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:45,087
I can't believe we're participating in this consumer circle jerk.

565
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,322
The dateless need to stick together tonight.

566
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,695
We're like survivors huddling for warmth.

567
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,700
You've probably had so many Valentines.

568
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,268
Is that some kind of euphemism for slut?

569
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,977
The one I remember most was my dad.

570
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:03,837
Where was that?

571
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,643
It was before we left Tennessee.

572
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,980
I was six and he had already left,

573
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:11,210
but he'd come back every so often.

574
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,821
He roared up on his motorcycle, took me out alone.

575
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,417
We had pancakes with chocolate syrup at a diner, at night.

576
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,496
He let me order.

577
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,900
Where's your father?

578
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,603
Beijing. He moved there years ago for the economic boom.

579
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,575
You guys have a relationship?

580
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,079
He checks in, pays my tuition.

581
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,528
But we couldn't be more different.

582
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:41,808
I think he's a little disappointed.

583
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:49,090
I spent some time in Tokyo with him when I was seven.

584
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:52,693
He was running a company there, working 12, 14 hours a day.

585
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,453
So, I had this full-time

586
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:56,561
Japanese babysitter who didn't speak English.

587
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,895
We couldn't understand each other at all.

588
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,795
Pretty soon, she ran out of things to do with me

589
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,873
and I ended up never leaving the hotel room.

590
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,135
I was like a veal.

591
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,472
What were you like as a child?

592
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,179
I was such a better person than I am now.

593
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,179
- Come on. - I'm serious.

594
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,759
I was happy, I was open, I was curious.

595
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,890
But I'll tell you this, I knew when it was ending.

596
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,059
I was overwhelmed with

597
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,330
sadness when I realized that I was gonna change

598
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,597
and that it was all most likely gonna get worse.

599
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,307
Like a nostalgia for the present, I couldn't shake it.

600
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,079
What?

601
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,381
I'm weird, right?

602
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,351
No.

603
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,519
No, you're not.

604
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,390
It's weird not having a boyfriend.

605
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,092
It's been so long.

606
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:06,738
That's because it's the

607
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:09,027
first year at school nobody's older than you.

608
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,640
Your pool dried up.

609
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,868
- How do you know that? - I'm a very insightful person.

610
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,610
Have you ever had sex?

611
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,881
Yeah, tons.

612
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,820
No, really. Have you?

613
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,817
Why are you asking me this?

614
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,992
You know I haven't.

615
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,728
Well, I don't know, I'm just wondering.

616
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,705
Have you ever thought about me?

617
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:46,901
What do you mean?

618
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:52,239
You know what I mean. Have you ever thought about it?

619
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,746
Why are you doing this?

620
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,021
Will you have sex with me?

621
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,993
I'm just kidding.

622
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,502
Bad idea.

623
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,405
I mean, can you imagine how weird that would be?

624
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,346
You're my only real friend.

625
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,518
Let's not ruin it.

626
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,256
Should we check in with Will and Zoe?

627
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,071
George?

628
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,741
George?

629
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,468
I have to go.

630
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,441
What?

631
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,346
I'm not feeling well.

632
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,951
Okay. Well, will I see you tomorrow?

633
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,020
I don't know.

634
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,922
This is wrong. It's a joke.

635
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,391
You think too much, George!

636
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,045
Get out.

637
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,219
George? What is going on? Why aren't you at school?

638
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,862
If you speak even the most

639
00:48:12,863 --> 00:48:14,714
rudimentary form of the English language,

640
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:15,847
then you'll understand this,

641
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,585
leave me alone.

642
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,828
What did you just say to me?

643
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,726
Vivian, my voice is calm.

644
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,233
I'm a free-thinking individual

645
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,633
who chooses not to be engaged in this discussion.

646
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,939
Please.

647
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,076
George, what are you doing?

648
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,646
I'm sorry, Jack. I need to be left alone right now.

649
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,182
What about your work?

650
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,942
I just can't do it right now.

651
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,114
I'm going through something.

652
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,689
That's pathetic.

653
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:24,994
At least it's the truth.

654
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,192
What's that supposed to mean?

655
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,530
- Hey. - Hey.

656
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,934
- How are you? - Good.

657
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,206
That's good.

658
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,837
Everything... Everything all right?

659
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,969
Yeah. Yeah, everything's all right.

660
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,683
How's George? He hasn't returned my calls.

661
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,617
Yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.

662
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,317
He's not exactly speaking to me either.

663
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,894
- Why? What happened? - I don't know.

664
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,987
You know George.

665
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,559
He's complicated, I guess.

666
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,037
Yeah.

667
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,630
I was wondering,

668
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,234
I'm not just George's friend to you, am I?

669
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:34,453
You and George should be together, Sally.

670
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,482
We're just friends.

671
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,528
There's no such thing.

672
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,498
I love this song.

673
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,532
You wanna dance?

674
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,601
Come on.

675
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,816
What?

676
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,682
We shouldn't be doing this.

677
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,961
- We're just dancing. - Oh, yeah?

678
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,948
George.

679
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:37,946
Been looking forward to

680
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:40,247
reading your Hardy paper. Today's the day.

681
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,916
Sorry, I don't have it.

682
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,388
George, this was your final project of the year.

683
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,296
After this, there's just exams. How am I supposed to grade you?

684
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,063
I'll have it to you by next week, I promise.

685
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,136
That's not gonna be good enough.

686
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,005
Hey, pal.

687
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,051
I called this meeting because your teachers have reported to me

688
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,958
that you continue to refuse to do the course work.

689
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,429
You have made zero effort

690
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,726
to turn your career here at Morgan around.

691
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,467
Yes, I did.

692
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,960
I mean, I did struggle

693
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:29,800
with it at the beginning, but I just couldn't.

694
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,328
Well, you are out of time.

695
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:35,431
The moment to decide your future has arrived.

696
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:41,631
Now, against the recommendation of some in this room,

697
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,602
I'm giving you a choice.

698
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:46,102
First is expulsion.

699
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,373
It's yours if you want it.

700
00:53:48,612 --> 00:53:49,977
Second option,

701
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:52,025
if you want to graduate,

702
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:55,181
you make up every single assignment you missed.

703
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,980
Every paper, every exercise.

704
00:53:57,087 --> 00:54:00,318
Essentially, a year's worth of homework.

705
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:05,327
If even one is missing on graduation day, no diploma.

706
00:54:07,865 --> 00:54:09,833
You have a little over three weeks.

707
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:12,673
George, I used to believe

708
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:15,204
you had more potential than anyone else here.

709
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:17,240
But you never delivered, not once.

710
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,532
I wasn't gonna waste the time getting mad at you.

711
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,735
I'm not gonna waste the time defending you now.

712
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:30,949
Forget the lack of respect you show, George.

713
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:36,816
This is the way we make our living, how we spend our lives.

714
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:40,028
But you simply don't care what goes on around here.

715
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:42,824
Why would we continue to reward that?

716
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:46,468
You're right.

717
00:54:47,604 --> 00:54:48,969
You shouldn't reward it.

718
00:54:52,176 --> 00:54:54,474
I honestly don't know what to say.

719
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:57,844
Maybe it should be expulsion.

720
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,750
Let us know on Monday.

721
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:04,984
All right. All right.

722
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,879
Thank you.

723
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,396
Did you tell my parents about this?

724
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:20,930
Yes, George, I had to.

725
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:34,484
Hey.

726
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,018
I don't know what to say.

727
00:55:37,855 --> 00:55:40,915
Is it my fault? I mean, I've had a lot on my mind and...

728
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,390
It's not your fault.

729
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:46,496
I don't think I can do it.

730
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:49,532
Well, what do you mean? What other choice is there?

731
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:51,032
Mom, I'm not sure that I can.

732
00:55:51,033 --> 00:55:52,568
You're just gonna have to do it.

733
00:55:52,669 --> 00:55:55,160
You're just gonna have to sit down and just do it!

734
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:56,739
Mom, I'm trying to speak to you honestly.

735
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:59,741
I don't care! I'm done listening to your lies!

736
00:55:59,877 --> 00:56:01,208
Come on, that's really the way to fix this!

737
00:56:01,311 --> 00:56:04,712
Hey, George! This is your mess, and it's a disaster.

738
00:56:05,082 --> 00:56:06,515
You're right, Jack. It is my mess.

739
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:08,778
I'll handle my mess, you handle yours.

740
00:56:09,386 --> 00:56:11,013
- Okay, watch that tone. - Wait, Viv.

741
00:56:12,556 --> 00:56:13,784
What does that mean?

742
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:16,393
I mean, you wanna tell us where you've been spending your days

743
00:56:16,493 --> 00:56:17,926
for a couple of months this past winter?

744
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:20,930
What's going on with your disaster?

745
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:22,928
Phone gets shut off. We can't pay the electricity.

746
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:25,058
Furniture is disappearing around here piece by piece.

747
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:27,735
George, stop it. You don't understand.

748
00:56:27,905 --> 00:56:28,894
Do you?

749
00:56:29,773 --> 00:56:31,900
Do you know that Jack was wandering the streets for weeks,

750
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:33,476
pretending to go to work?

751
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,269
Did you get that sorted out, Jack?

752
00:56:35,379 --> 00:56:36,588
Or are you still working out

753
00:56:36,589 --> 00:56:38,576
of a coffee shop booth like a homeless person?

754
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:39,805
Jack, stop!

755
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:42,745
Stop it!

756
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:46,353
Jack! Stop!

757
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,284
Get off!

758
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:55,856
George!

759
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:10,478
Sally!

760
00:57:11,882 --> 00:57:13,315
Sally?

761
00:57:16,286 --> 00:57:17,719
George!

762
00:57:19,623 --> 00:57:21,420
What's going on? What happened?

763
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,873
What's wrong?

764
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:42,337
What is it?

765
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:02,864
George.

766
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,890
George, hey.

767
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:09,736
I just wanted to make sure you're all right.

768
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,478
I had a really hard time, George.

769
00:58:16,346 --> 00:58:19,144
I swear. I promise, I...

770
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,846
I thought you were gonna leave it alone.

771
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:25,987
I'm not gonna say sorry.

772
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:30,957
Isn't it better that it's me?

773
00:58:31,695 --> 00:58:34,721
As opposed to some douche bag she just met

774
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:38,063
and wouldn't even let you look at her?

775
00:58:39,036 --> 00:58:40,560
You want me to thank you?

776
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,497
I actually felt something.

777
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:46,612
That doesn't always happen.

778
00:58:46,613 --> 00:58:48,737
It hasn't happened in a very long time.

779
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:50,680
And I've lived long enough

780
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:53,883
to know that when it does, you should act on it.

781
00:58:57,321 --> 00:58:58,948
I didn't think you were ready.

782
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:07,491
I thought you were so cool.

783
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,391
I never meet anyone cool.

784
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:55,576
Hi.

785
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,239
Hi.

786
00:59:58,015 --> 00:59:59,414
I didn't want to be up there.

787
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:02,612
Can't have been fun for you.

788
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:08,351
He broke his collarbone. We were in the ER all night.

789
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:12,823
I'm so sorry. That should have never happened.

790
01:00:12,996 --> 01:00:14,657
Mom, I started it.

791
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:18,366
He's a 50-year-old man.

792
01:00:19,136 --> 01:00:20,501
He's supposed to protect you.

793
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:22,629
Mom, I'm obnoxious, I'm deeply disrespectful.

794
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:24,502
We're getting a divorce.

795
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:37,682
Come on, I'm sure he'll never do it again.

796
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,457
Now that he knows I can hospitalize him.

797
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:47,022
We were already headed there.

798
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:50,361
His business went bankrupt about a year ago,

799
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:54,233
and I thought I should have faith in him and support him.

800
01:00:54,438 --> 01:00:58,306
But there was always some sort of excuse,

801
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:01,409
or his luck was about to turn.

802
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:04,639
So, he convinced me to mortgage the apartment,

803
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,545
and then my own business.

804
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:08,943
But it was never enough.

805
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:13,717
He's a sick man, and I should have told you,

806
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:15,506
but you were under enough

807
01:01:15,507 --> 01:01:17,556
pressure and I didn't wanna distract you.

808
01:01:17,794 --> 01:01:19,318
I like distractions.

809
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:22,489
It gets worse.

810
01:01:27,871 --> 01:01:29,338
I have to sell the apartment.

811
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,172
What?

812
01:01:31,975 --> 01:01:35,433
The debt has erased my credit.

813
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,263
What am I gonna do?

814
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:02,599
I'll do it.

815
01:02:03,206 --> 01:02:04,571
Hold on.

816
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:06,540
You have three weeks.

817
01:02:06,743 --> 01:02:09,177
And you still have to come to school and take finals.

818
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:10,880
You know that already?

819
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:13,822
Pick up your assignment packets

820
01:02:13,823 --> 01:02:16,012
from your teachers. You miss one, no diploma.

821
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:18,414
- Okay. - Go.

822
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:24,222
I've given this a lot of thought, George.

823
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:26,520
I don't think I'm being easy on you.

824
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,597
I simply don't believe that dull, lifeless assignments

825
01:02:29,733 --> 01:02:32,258
are the measures of a person's soul.

826
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:36,504
I want one,

827
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:39,141
one meaningful work from you.

828
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:42,209
I want you to look in the mirror, listen to your gut,

829
01:02:42,446 --> 01:02:46,610
and make an image that speaks to the real you.

830
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,477
What you care about. What you believe.

831
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,380
It can be big, it can be small.

832
01:02:55,459 --> 01:02:57,825
It can be painted in bat shit.

833
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:01,455
As long as it's honest and fearless.

834
01:03:02,899 --> 01:03:04,833
Harris, you have no idea how much this helps...

835
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:07,469
But! But. The caveat.

836
01:03:07,671 --> 01:03:09,366
If I smell a rat,

837
01:03:09,606 --> 01:03:11,180
if you didn't find something

838
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:13,599
you've never had the courage to say before,

839
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:16,938
I don't pass you. You don't get out of here.

840
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,872
All your work down the drain.

841
01:03:21,518 --> 01:03:23,645
Now, go, get out of here.

842
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,190
How are you?

843
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:32,558
How are things with Jack?

844
01:03:33,463 --> 01:03:35,363
Look, what is so wrong with me seeing Dustin?

845
01:03:35,465 --> 01:03:36,864
He told me he was gonna leave it alone.

846
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:38,807
But you told him we weren't together!

847
01:03:38,808 --> 01:03:39,968
What should I have said?

848
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,560
What did you wanna say?

849
01:03:41,671 --> 01:03:44,009
There you go again with the mind games.

850
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,108
Treacherous, sadistic little hussy.

851
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:49,667
George! There was nothing between us.

852
01:03:52,716 --> 01:03:56,277
- I'm sorry. - No. You're right.

853
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,713
I gotta go. I have to make up

854
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:04,021
a year's worth of homework or I don't graduate.

855
01:04:04,227 --> 01:04:06,525
- What? - Have fun with Dustin.

856
01:04:08,298 --> 01:04:10,732
I'm so pleased to have made the introduction.

857
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:13,802
And it's good.

858
01:04:13,904 --> 01:04:15,667
We've had some great memories here, you know?

859
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:20,675
We should definitely look into signing a lease for this place.

860
01:04:20,877 --> 01:04:22,276
- It's absolutely perfect. - Sure, sure.

861
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:08,480
It's a great room. Hi, honey.

862
01:07:11,648 --> 01:07:13,206
I think I'm done.

863
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:15,316
Me, too.

864
01:07:17,253 --> 01:07:20,416
We had a lot of fun in the beginning, you, me, and your father.

865
01:07:21,324 --> 01:07:22,882
I don't get what happened.

866
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:25,092
After Dad.

867
01:07:25,428 --> 01:07:27,191
Things change.

868
01:07:28,098 --> 01:07:30,999
Sometimes so quickly you don't even notice it.

869
01:07:31,868 --> 01:07:33,189
I don't know. Happiness is,

870
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,099
like, something you have to look after,

871
01:07:35,238 --> 01:07:36,603
be vigilant about.

872
01:07:38,508 --> 01:07:40,999
I mean, you know that Jack loved us.

873
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:43,608
That wasn't an illusion.

874
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,214
He loved you like a son.

875
01:07:47,784 --> 01:07:49,308
Do you know where he is now?

876
01:07:51,955 --> 01:07:53,320
No.

877
01:07:56,593 --> 01:07:59,255
Do you have any idea of what you wanna do?

878
01:08:01,297 --> 01:08:03,162
I wanna try and get into an art school.

879
01:08:05,401 --> 01:08:06,732
I need real training.

880
01:08:39,102 --> 01:08:40,626
Thank you for coming.

881
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:46,536
So much has happened, and so much is happening, and...

882
01:08:47,844 --> 01:08:50,642
I just need you to be my friend, okay?

883
01:08:51,781 --> 01:08:54,545
I really, really need that. Please.

884
01:09:01,991 --> 01:09:04,721
My mom is marrying this guy she's known for three months

885
01:09:04,861 --> 01:09:06,488
and moving to Texas to be with him.

886
01:09:06,963 --> 01:09:08,897
She's already down there.

887
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:11,863
Getting engaged means her alimony payment stops,

888
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:16,064
which means she can't pay my tuition for Boulder next year,

889
01:09:16,372 --> 01:09:18,067
which means I don't get out.

890
01:09:19,309 --> 01:09:21,470
She wants me to go live with her in Texas.

891
01:09:22,946 --> 01:09:24,311
What are you gonna do?

892
01:09:25,014 --> 01:09:27,244
That's the hard part.

893
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:31,583
Because I'm leaving tomorrow.

894
01:09:32,622 --> 01:09:34,112
Where are you going?

895
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:38,724
Dustin and I are gonna backpack around Europe for the summer.

896
01:09:38,928 --> 01:09:41,362
His show sold out. It's his present to me.

897
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:44,559
What about graduation?

898
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:49,670
After everything, I'm over it. They can mail it to me.

899
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,466
And Zoe, Will, and...

900
01:09:51,641 --> 01:09:53,108
I love those guys,

901
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:56,211
but that was never really me.

902
01:09:57,513 --> 01:09:58,878
And after Europe?

903
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:02,577
Who knows? Not Texas.

904
01:10:05,722 --> 01:10:07,087
I need to tell you something.

905
01:10:10,994 --> 01:10:12,985
You were right, in a way.

906
01:10:13,129 --> 01:10:15,689
I should've been able to say what I wanted to.

907
01:10:20,036 --> 01:10:22,971
I'm in love with you. I always have been.

908
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:31,121
I thought you were the unfair one,

909
01:10:31,122 --> 01:10:33,181
but it was unfair of me not to say it.

910
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,550
So, I've said it.

911
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:41,221
I was nothing.

912
01:10:42,058 --> 01:10:43,787
I felt like nothing.

913
01:10:44,794 --> 01:10:46,193
Less than.

914
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:49,396
You changed that.

915
01:12:05,174 --> 01:12:07,472
You know we're gonna be together one day.

916
01:12:08,177 --> 01:12:11,146
We have to sort through all of our messed-up issues

917
01:12:11,381 --> 01:12:12,542
and you have to sleep with

918
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,509
a lot of girls to get it out of your system.

919
01:12:15,852 --> 01:12:17,547
Don't go.

920
01:12:17,687 --> 01:12:19,245
Please.

921
01:12:19,355 --> 01:12:20,845
It's a long life.

922
01:12:21,557 --> 01:12:23,115
We're not done.

923
01:12:28,364 --> 01:12:31,856
Treacherous, sadistic little hussy.

924
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:38,172
I love you, too.

925
01:13:40,937 --> 01:13:42,302
Here it is.

926
01:13:43,806 --> 01:13:45,205
We'll see.

927
01:13:46,275 --> 01:13:48,402
We are getting down to the wire.

928
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:52,710
I'll either be calling your name or I won't.

929
01:14:30,486 --> 01:14:31,976
Son of a bitch.

930
01:14:41,397 --> 01:14:42,762
Mara Ryder.

931
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,426
Did she say when she'd be back?

932
01:14:49,105 --> 01:14:51,630
I can't believe she didn't even call me.

933
01:14:52,608 --> 01:14:54,235
What did I do?

934
01:14:54,443 --> 01:14:56,240
Will Sharpe.

935
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,435
They're about to close the doors.

936
01:15:26,676 --> 01:15:29,626
Final boarding call for Dallas Flight 2013,

937
01:15:29,627 --> 01:15:31,136
passenger Diana Mayer.

938
01:15:32,515 --> 01:15:33,914
Come here.

939
01:15:55,538 --> 01:15:57,665
Veronica Walsh.

940
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,232
You're gonna be okay.

941
01:16:00,476 --> 01:16:01,875
I'm fine.

942
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:04,708
We'll have plenty of girls lined up for you, I promise.

943
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:06,372
Zoe, really, I'm...

944
01:16:07,216 --> 01:16:09,081
Thank you.

945
01:16:09,785 --> 01:16:11,184
And

946
01:16:11,954 --> 01:16:14,047
George Zinavoy.

947
01:16:44,987 --> 01:16:47,717
Anything is possible.

948
01:17:27,096 --> 01:17:28,688
- Hey. - Hey, what's up?

949
01:17:29,565 --> 01:17:30,589
I'm starving.

950
01:18:33,329 --> 01:18:34,728
Not bad.

951
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,333
I mean, it's all right.

952
01:18:47,376 --> 01:18:49,003
It's good.

953
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:04,721
So, what are you gonna do?

954
01:19:05,895 --> 01:19:07,362
Are you staying?

955
01:19:12,468 --> 01:19:14,060
I don't know.

956
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:26,639
? Trav'ling lady, stay awhile ?

957
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:37,518
? I'm just a station on your way ?

958
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:44,654
? I know I'm not your lover ?

959
00:47:56,206 --> 00:48:00,870
? Trav'ling lady, stay awhile ?

960
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:56,430
? Trav'ling lady, stay awhile ?

961
00:48:56,566 --> 00:49:00,332
? Until the night is over ?

962
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,255
And why are you so quiet now ?

963
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,398
? standing there in the doorway? ?

964
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,731
? You chose your journey long before ?

965
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:15,439
? You came upon this highway ?

966
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:27,015
? Trav'ling lady, stay awhile ?

967
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,626
? Until the night is over ?

968
01:04:50,507 --> 01:04:53,704
? What the rest did I was average ?

969
01:04:53,843 --> 01:04:57,006
? But I don't mind ?

970
01:04:57,814 --> 01:05:01,306
? Drawn on two sides without disguise ?

971
01:05:01,484 --> 01:05:03,714
? But I don't mind ?

972
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:14,695
? And you, you don't believe me ?

973
01:05:15,131 --> 01:05:18,225
? And I, I find it easy ?

974
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:23,136
? Easy ?

975
01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:32,679
? You're recruited head diluted through a glass eye ?

976
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:37,348
? Dreams in fiction lost religion ?

977
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:40,116
? But I don't mind ?

978
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:47,396
? Cause I spit fire on lovers and liars ?

979
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:50,962
? And you, you don't believe me ?

980
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:54,465
? And I, I find it easy ?

981
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:58,437
? Easy ?

982
01:06:17,293 --> 01:06:23,960
? And I, I spit fire on lovers and liars ?

983
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,866
? And you, you don't believe me ?

984
01:06:27,971 --> 01:06:30,940
? And I, I find it easy ?

985
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:32,008
? Easy ?

986
01:06:53,563 --> 01:07:00,435
? I, I spit fire on lovers and liars ?

987
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:04,131
? And you won't deceive me ?
