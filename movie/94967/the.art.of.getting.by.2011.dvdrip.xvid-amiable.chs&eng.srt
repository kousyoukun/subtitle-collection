我想见你

24
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,415
? I've got a cupboard with cans of food ?

25
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,227
? Filtered water and pictures of you ?

26
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,325
? And I'm not coming out until this is all over ?

27
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,762
? And I'm looking through the glass ?

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,233
? Where the light bends at the cracks?

29
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,645
? And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs ?

30
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:32,116
? Pretending the echoes belong to someone ?

31
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,251
? Someone I used to know ?

32
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,664
? And we become ?

33
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,638
? Silhouettes when our bodies finally go ?

34
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,564
从人类历史有记录开始
Since the dawn of recorded history,

35
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,411
大约有1100亿人
something like 110 billion

36
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:47,236
在这个世界上出生
human beings have been born into this world.

37
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,780
这数字靠单一的个体是不可能完成的
And not a single one of them made it.

38
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,749
在这个星球上住着68亿人
There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.

39
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,288
每年大概有6000万人去世  6000万人
Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people.

40
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,850
这就可以得出结论 每天有16万人去世
That comes out to about 160,000 per day.

41
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,622
我小时候读到这么一句话
I read this quote once when I was a kid,

42
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,652
"我们孤单地活着 终将孤单地死去
"We live alone, we die alone.

43
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:10,169
人生不过一场虚无"
Everything else is just an illusion. "

44
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,505
这话曾让我想到半夜睡不着觉
It used to keep me up at night.

45
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,137
我们都孤单地活着
We all die alone.

46
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,675
那我为什么要
So, why am I supposed to

47
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:20,303
操劳 艰苦还有挣扎
spend my life working, sweating, struggling?

48
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,636
当那一切都不过是一场虚无
For an illusion?

49
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,607
即使有再多的朋友
Because no amount of friends,

50
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,641
再多的女友
no girl,

51
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,650
再多的满分作业
no assignments about conjugating the pluperfect

52
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,589
或者算出直角三角形斜边的平方根
or determining the square root of the hypotenuse

53
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,592
都不能避免我最终离世的命运
is gonna help me avoid my fate.

54
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,224
我的生活应当做更有意义的事
I have better things to do with my time.

55
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,993
George 作业做完了吗
Do you have your work, George?

56
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,230
- 没  - 为什么
- No. - Why not?

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,201
因为我有点沮丧
I was depressed.

58
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,536
是嘛 怎么回事
Oh, yes? Why was that?

59
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,210
因为我意识到我终有一天会死去
Because I realized I'm gonna die one day.

60
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,679
George 我们都会离开人世
We're all gonna die one day, George.

61
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
我想 这不是你不做三角函数作业
I don't think that's a reasonable excuse

62
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,683
的合理解释
for not completing your trigonometry exercise.

63
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,448
我逼迫自己去做了
Well, I was trying to.

64
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,591
但我终将死去的事实在我脑海中不断萦绕
I just couldn't shake this awareness of my mortality.

65
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,390
世事都变得没有意义
Everything seemed meaningless,

66
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,253
很不幸 写作业也包括在内
including the assignment, unfortunately.

67
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,196
你给我去校长办公室
I want you to go to the principal's office

68
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,598
去发现写作业的意义
and find meaning in the homework.

69
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,137
并且在期末前把作业交给我
Bring it to me completed by the end of the period.

70
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,959
- 你迟到了  - 我写作业太专心了
- You're late. - I was so engrossed in my work.

71
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,152
孩子 你又要挨训了
Boy, I wouldn't wanna be you right now.

72
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,731
- 我什么也没做  - 你总是做错事
- I haven't done anything. - You've always done something.

73
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,169
你最好快点去
You better go.

74
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,836
Bill.

75
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,640
虽然你是毕业生 有校外活动的特权
Even though you have off-campus privileges as a senior,

76
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,978
如果你被发现在校外吸烟的话
if you are seen anywhere in the city smoking,

77
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,142
你的特权将被撤回 即时生效
you have your privileges revoked. Automatic probation.

78
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,847
干嘛告诉我这些
Why are you telling me?

79
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,523
- 你以为我闻不出来吗  - 随便你
- You think I can't smell? - You can smell all you want.

80
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,259
我们能进入正题了吗
Shall we get down to business?

81
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,717
那么开始吧
Yes, we shall.

82
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,864
从某种层面说 你的未来决定于接下来几个月的表现
In a way, your future depends on the next few months.

83
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,957
不只是为了上大学
Not just for college.

84
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,004
而是为你的将来打下基础
I mean, it sets the tone for everything that follows.

85
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,239
我知道你是怎么想的 
Now, I know how you think and I know

86
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,901
你认为现在太晚了 而你又是宿命论者
you're thinking it's too late and you're gonna be a fatalist

87
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,409
对现在的一切毫不在乎
and let it all go to hell.

88
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,876
但是 George 如果你坚持你现在所走的路
But, George, if you keep performing the way you are,

89
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,917
就别想毕业了 更别说上大学了
forget about college, forget about graduating, even.

90
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,409
所以
So,

91
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,119
这次只是处以警告 再有下次就是开除学籍了
this counts as your official warning. Suspension is next.

92
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,523
下次应该是留校察看吧
I thought probation was next.

93
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,989
别威胁我 这不管用
Don't play the angles, George. They won't work.

94
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,225
也别开玩笑
Neither do jokes.

95
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,323
我没开玩笑
I wasn't joking.

96
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,627
我知道你很有才华
I know you're capable.

97
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,032
我积极性方面真的很成问题
I have a real problem with motivating.

98
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,206
但我想我会设法克服
But I think I can do it.

99
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,871
我会努力的
I'll try.

100
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,074
好吧 可以出去了
All right, go.

101
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,411
不要让我失望了
And don't make me regret it.

102
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,844
谁在天台上吸烟
Who's smoking up here?

103
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,481
George 你知道你在干什么吗
George! What do you think you're doing?

104
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,194
对不起 我
Sorry. I...

105
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,395
我今天真的很不顺
I was having a tough day.

106
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,557
我承受的压力很大 Dougherty夫人 
I guess the stress finally got to me, Mrs. Dougherty.

107
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,896
George 为什么要吸烟
George, why do you do these things?

108
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,632
谢谢你
Thank you.

109
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,434
什么压力
Now, what do you mean by stress?

110
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,985
- 嗨 - 嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

111
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,697
- 我收到了你学校发来的邮件  - 天哪
- I got an e-mail from your school. - Oh, Jesus.

112
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,532
类似于留校察看
Some kind of academic probation?

113
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,465
我能帮你吗
Can I help you?

114
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:24,134
要不请个家庭教师或者私立大学的导师
Can I get you a tutor or a private college advisor?

115
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,607
如果你考不进一个像样的学校
If you don't get into a decent school,

116
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,581
我都不知道你能不能找到工作了
then I don't know how you're gonna get a job.

117
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,208
我自己能处理
I have it under control.

118
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,950
亲爱的 如果你考不进一个像样的大学
Honey, if you don't get into a decent college...

119
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,515
- 我看电视去了  - 不准去
- I'm gonna go watch TV. - No, you will not watch TV.

120
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,855
呆在这
You will stay here

121
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,159
直到我们想出切实可行的方案
till we can come up with a plan for getting you into college.

122
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,994
我今天在学校过得很不顺 我很累了
I had a hard day at school, I'm tired,

123
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,728
我现在想要休息半个小时
and I'm gonna go relax now for half an hour.

124
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,073
然后我就去做作业 可以吗
Then I will do my work. Okay?

125
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,647
George?

126
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,810
TMD你在干什么
The fuck are you doing?

127
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,146
画画
I'm drawing.

128
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,953
你这臭小子 找到素描素材了没
Are you sketching your subject, you little shit?

129
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,627
是的
Yes.

130
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,631
- Harris 我没有素材 - 见鬼 为什么没有
- I don't have a subject, Harris. - Why the heck not?

131
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,739
不知道
I don't know.

132
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,468
George 你要善于发掘身边的事物
George, you're going to have to start digging around in there,

133
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,601
那样才能开发自身的潜能
so you can develop that talent of yours,

134
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,010
才能有想法
so you can start to use that brain of yours

135
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,378
去表达内心深处的美丽
to express that beautiful heart of yours.

136
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,982
好好想想你要传达的是什么 然后画出来
So, figure out what you want to say, and say it.

137
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,145
- Harris  - 嗯
- Harris. - Yes.

138
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,087
我没有什么要传达的
I don't have anything to say.

139
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,162
用心去找
Find something!

140
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,875
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

141
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,740
- 我是Sally  - 我知道
- I'm Sally. - I know.

142
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,315
谢谢你替我顶罪
Thanks for covering for me.

143
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,509
不用谢
No problem.

144
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,779
为什么那么做
Why did you?

145
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,512
不知道
I don't know.

146
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,157
你特立独行
You were doing something so renegade,

147
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,691
不该因教条受到惩罚
I thought you deserved to get away with it.

148
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,623
我三天两头被叫到办公室
I run afoul of the authorities so often,

149
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,289
处理这样的事比你有经验
I figured I could handle it better than you.

150
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,496
你真的很怪
You're really weird.

151
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,607
为什么一直不写作业
So, why don't you ever do your work?

152
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,766
有那么多比写作业更重要的事去做
There are so many more important things to think about,

153
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,311
于是写作业就可做可不做了
homework ends up seeming like an afterthought.

154
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,507
注意力不足过动症吗
Add?

155
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,446
不 他们做了所有的努力
No, they tried everything.

156
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,314
利他林 普能 导师 心理治疗
Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy.

157
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,218
不起作用的 我就像懒虫中的战斗机
Nothing worked. I'm the Teflon slacker.

158
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,216
其实我们每个人都在死去 你懂不
No, it's more like, we're living in a dying time, you know?

159
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,094
全球变暖 战争 恐怖行动还有海啸
I mean, you got global warming, wars, terrorism, tsunamis.

160
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,258
- 好了  - 我们整个社会正在走向衰落
- Okay... - We're definitely on the downhill side.

161
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,299
那我们努力活着为了什么 有什么用呢
So, what are we working towards? What's the point?

162
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,037
我也会恐惧 但是都没你那样的
I thought I had fears, but they're pretty run-of-the-mill.

163
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,041
- 我惧怕痛苦还有死亡  - 我不害怕这些
- Pain, death. - Not me.

164
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,006
我怕的是活着
I fear life.

165
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,973
George 你有朋友吗
Do you have any friends, George?

166
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,944
我有点愤世嫉俗
I'm kind of a misanthrope.

167
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,719
这不由我决定
Not a choice, just a fact.

168
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,764
再见 帅哥 
Okay, handsome.

169
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,536
妈妈 注意形象
Mom! Jesus!

170
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,278
嗨 翘鼻子
Hi, banana!

171
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,679
进来吗
You wanna come up?

172
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,423
对于刚才的事很抱歉 我们度过了一个美好的夜晚
I'm sorry about that, chicken. We had a really late night.

173
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,551
你上学前我们刚到家
I think we got home right before you left for school.

174
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,192
妈妈 这是我新结识的朋友 George
Mom, this is my new friend, George.

175
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,665
- 你好 George  - 你好 Howe夫人
- Well, George. - Hello, Mrs. Howe.

176
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,396
- 见到你很高兴  - 很高兴
- What a genuine pleasure. - Very nice to...

177
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,596
Sally 高脚杯放哪了
Sally, do you know where our stemware went?

178
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,832
我想喝杯白兰地
I'm drinking wine out of a tumbler.

179
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,363
George 你喝什么
What do you want, George?

180
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,803
我们在乡下时就那么干
And this was before we left the sticks.

181
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,971
我使了一下颜色 向下看
So, I cock one eye, look down,

182
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,877
以为会看到一只田鳖
expecting to see a giant water bug,

183
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,681
或是水蛇 或是
or a water moccasin, or...

184
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,316
一些我巴不得杀了的水生动物
Water something. Something I had to kill.

185
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,621
但却是飞行员的手
But it was the pilot's hand!

186
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,695
别激动
Oh!

187
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,996
痒不痒 这里
Ticklish, this one!

188
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,234
拿条毛巾给你
Let me get you a paper towel.

189
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,537
你们知道吗 怕痒的人都是好情人
You know, ticklish people make great lovers.

190
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,601
身体的每一处都能唤起情欲
Everything is erogenous.

191
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,206
天哪 太神了
My God. She's amazing.

192
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,407
如果你是她女儿就不那么想了
Not if you're her daughter.

193
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,608
怎么来纽约了
How'd you end up in New York?

194
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,019
我母亲16岁的时候有了我 我父亲是一名卡车司机
My mom had me when she was 16. My dad was a truck driver,

195
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,387
有一天他离开了就再也没有回来过
and one day he took off and never came back.

196
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,959
那是在哪里
And this was?

197
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,654
克拉克斯堡 田纳西州的一个小镇
Clarksburg. It's a small town in Tennessee.

198
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,996
他是纽约的暴发户 有一家纺织厂
This rich guy from New York, who owned a textile plant,

199
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,155
他拯救了我们
started coming down, and it

200
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:20,733
就像是垂死之人抓到救命稻草
was like we were castaways and he was the ship.

201
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,499
但我是8岁时来这的
But I ended up here,

202
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:29,047
新学校 新朋友和漂亮的新衣服
eight years old, new school, new friends, fancy new clothes.

203
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,440
我妈妈一年前和他离婚了
My mom divorced him a year ago,

204
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,610
现在又恢复神经质的单身生活
and now she's back on the singles scene with a vengeance.

205
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,684
我该做作业去了
I do think I should get some homework done, though.

206
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,522
我也该回去了  有事要做
I should get going then. Got work to do myself.

207
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,499
不错
Yeah, right.

208
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,401
谢谢
Thank you.

209
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,704
再见
Goodbye.

210
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,142
这不是第一次发生了
It's not the first time it's happened.

211
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,609
我知道
I know.

212
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,214
你也从来不认为他们会发生这样的事
But you never think it's gonna be the people that it's gonna be.

213
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,974
他们都在一起15年了
They've been together for 15 years.

214
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:39,682
这当然很荒谬
I know. It's certainly ridiculous.

215
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,151
- 怎么没电了  - 嗨 亲爱的
- What happened to the electricity? - Hi, sweetie.

216
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,882
我们叫了烤鸡店的外卖
We got take-out from the rotisserie chicken place.

217
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,252
拿碟子来和我们一起吃吧
Grab a plate and join us.

218
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,349
为什么没电了 发生了什么
But the lights. What happened?

219
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,827
我的错 忘了付电费
It's my fault. I forgot to pay the bill.

220
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,831
没事 明天就有电了
And it's no big deal. They'll be on tomorrow.

221
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,662
George 我们可以将这
George, we're trying to turn

222
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,670
有点尴尬混乱的场面当作一次有趣的经历
this awkward little mix-up into a fun experience.

223
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,468
如果你不想加入我们的话
And if you can't get into the spirit of adventure,

224
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,384
可以做你自己的事
then you can just do your own thing.

225
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,942
也不必呆在这了
You don't have to stick around.

226
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,842
还真抱歉 Jack 我不能用手提电脑了
I'm sorry, Jack. I can't use my laptop,

227
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,847
更不用说写作业了
much less get my assignments.

228
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,544
可以去图书馆或者星巴克啊 要善于应变
So, go to the library or Starbucks. Be resourceful.

229
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,700
有人知道小说中的
Does anyone have any ideas about

230
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,376
哪些部分
which elements of the novel

231
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:34,000
具有文学浪漫主义运动的特征吗
pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?

232
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,409
有人知道吗
Anyone?

233
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,035
George?

234
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,881
George?

235
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,606
是
Yeah?

236
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,297
我的问题是在我们做的作业中
I was asking what conclusion

237
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:50,553
你得出了什么结论
you came to in the exercise we're doing.

238
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,223
抱歉 能再说一遍吗
Sorry. About what, again?

239
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,159
小说中的那些部分
About which elements of the novel

240
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,627
具有文学浪漫主义运动的特征
pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?

241
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,126
哪部小说
Which novel?

242
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,310
《卡斯特桥市长》
The Mayor of Casterbridge,

243
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:10,903
George 很显然 你没读过
George, which, obviously, you didn't read.

244
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,238
我很喜欢这小说
I loved it.

245
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,744
看得出  还有人知道吗
Clearly. Anyone else?

246
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,106
这部小说中我最喜欢的
My favorite part of the

247
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,981
是室内商业区的布局
book is how the town's layout is described

248
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,572
以纵览整座城镇的
from the perspective of a bee

249
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,883
蜜蜂的视角来描述
traveling from one side of town to the other.

250
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,320
这样的描述很形象
It's so visual.

251
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,558
我认为Hardy采用自然界中
So, I guess what Hardy's doing is aligning his point of view

252
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,925
最小 最纤弱的昆虫的视角来描述
not with an all-seeing God but with an insect,

253
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,021
而不是全能全知的视角进行描述
the tiniest, humblest creature in nature.

254
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,695
这样的手法很有浪漫主义运动的特征
Which is pretty Romantic.

255
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,797
George 我想你找到学期论文的主题了
I think you just found your term paper, George.

256
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,445
George!

257
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,520
Hi.

258
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,654
- 和我们一起吧  - 好
- Come join us. - Cool.

259
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,952
你认识Will和Zoe吧
You know Will and Zoe, right?

260
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,258
我们一起上数学课
Yeah, we're in math class together, right?

261
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,164
你从没写过作业
You never have your homework.

262
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,169
对 这是我的特色
Right. Right, it's my shtick.

263
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,707
- 你好 George - 你好 Zoe
- Hi, George. - Hey, Zoe.

264
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,241
哥们 你总是在画些什么
Dude, what are you always drawing?

265
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,176
他就像是发狂的艺术家 整天弯腰驼背在书上画些什么
He's like the mad artist, just hunched over his books.

266
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,871
从不听老师讲课
He never listens to a word the teacher says.

267
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,779
- 你不也一样吗  - 我能看看你画的那堆狗屎吗
- What, like you do? - Can I see some of the shit you draw?

268
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,952
当然
Yeah, sure.

269
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,261
一整本呢
You have issues.

270
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,324
哥们 你感情很细腻
No. Dude, you're sensitive.

271
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,900
多愁善感的画师
The sensitive artiste.

272
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,270
能给我的派对画一幅这样的画吗
Could you draw something like this for one of my parties?

273
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,931
在我弟弟除夕夜派对上贴上一幅巨大的画
I'm throwing a huge one at my brother's club on New Year's Eve.

274
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,564
- 说真的  - 当然
- You serious? - Yeah.

275
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,405
可以把它放大 做海报 邀请贴之类的
You know, we can blow it up, make it a poster, invites, flyers.

276
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,845
很不错 不是吗
Yeah, that'd be great, right?

277
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,359
- 嘿 George 你好吗  - 我很好
- Hey, George. How are you? - Fine.

278
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,236
干什么呢
Well, what are you doing?

279
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,230
写三角函数作业
Just finishing my trig assignment.

280
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,600
好孩子 这是我喜欢听到的
Good man. That's what I like to hear.

281
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,464
我收到了72人的回复
I've got 72 comps on my list alone.

282
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,530
- 大多是你的朋友  - 嗯
- Most of them are your friends. - Yeah.

283
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,737
他们会是派对上最酷的
And they're gonna be the coolest people there.

284
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,203
- 没错  - 别怀疑
- Yeah, you're right. - So don't question it.

285
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,673
而且 如果我叫上我的人 你的整体运作都将瘫痪
Besides, if I pull my people, your whole operation goes under.

286
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,302
- Will  - George小弟
- Will. - Brother George!

287
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,079
伙计 我太喜欢了
I love it, man.

288
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,752
正合适派对 
Nice celebratory mood. Perfect for a party.

289
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,283
下一步呢 巴斯奎特（著名艺术家）
So, what now, Basquiat?

290
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,453
守则第一条是翘课
Rule number one about cutting school.

291
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,032
我以前逃过课
I've cut school before.

292
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,566
去商店购物
To shop.

293
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,169
- 守则第一条 旷课很有趣  - 这什么守则
- Rule number one, cutting school is fun. - That's a rule?

294
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,966
守则第二条  少旷课以保持新鲜感
Rule number two, cut rarely to preserve the specialness.

295
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,770
这是话么
Is that even a word?

296
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,401
守则第三条
Rule number three,

297
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,632
买些书增加人文方面的修养
do something culturally

298
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,777
能促进道德的提升
rewarding with your time to earn it morally.

299
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,440
守则第四条 你是个呆子
Rule number four, you're a dork.

300
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,949
错 第四条是面条(双关:笨蛋)
Wrong. Rule number four, noodles.

301
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,652
面条
Noodles?

302
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:04,939
你就是那么看我们的
Is that how you see us?

303
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,542
你是个老人而我是你12岁的侄女
You're the old man and I'm your 12-year-old niece?

304
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,204
不是
No.

305
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,621
你带每个认识的女孩
So, what, you take all the

306
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:12,875
去看这部电影 这就是你秘密武器
girls to this movie? Is it your secret weapon?

307
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,144
玩什么不是玩
When you're cutting school, you go to whatever's playing.

308
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,688
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

309
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,714
- 等一下  - 干嘛
- Whoa. - What?

310
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,993
- 那是我继父  - 所以呢
- That's my stepfather. - So?

311
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,892
首先 他办公室在镇上的另一头
Well, A, his office is on the other side of town.

312
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,023
其次 他看上去很怪
And B, he looks weird.

313
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,161
我们跟踪他吧
Let's follow him.

314
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,264
你认为他在做什么
What do you think he's doing?

315
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:38,098
也许只是赶去开会
Probably just going to a meeting.

316
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,073
我打赌是和情人幽会
I bet it's a lovers' rendezvous.

317
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:42,112
我继父就一直那么干
My stepfather cheated all the time.

318
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,371
也许吧
Maybe.

319
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,486
无意冒犯 但是他看起来很吓人
No offense, but he looks kind of creepy.

320
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,458
开会才不会来这
Strange place for a meeting.

321
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,998
看来也不是什么
Lovers' rendezvous amended to

322
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,606
幽会地点了
drug buy from skanky hooker.

323
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,112
嘿 Bill
Hey, Bill.

324
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,813
你就像冷战时的间谍一样 来去无踪
You are like a Cold War spy. You move only in shadow.

325
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,980
我 我一直在附近啊
Me? I'm always around.

326
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,590
我看你交了些新朋友
I see you made some new friends.

327
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,957
不完全是
Not necessarily. Jury's still out.

328
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,997
我为你高兴 George 只是
I'm happy for you, George. I just...

329
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,123
我希望你小心点
I just want you to be careful.

330
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,263
- 他们怎么了  - 没啥
- What's wrong with them? - Nothing.

331
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:41,199
但是他们通过考试都比你容易
But they have an easier time of getting by than you do.

332
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,570
你跟不上这个学习团体的步伐
You're not exactly hooking up with a study group.

333
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,590
告诉你点消息
Hey, I have something for you.

334
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,906
几周后该开"职业介绍日"了
Career Day is coming up in a few weeks,

335
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,448
我们总是会让一名模范学生
and we always assign an exemplary student

336
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,746
代替摩根学校向同学发言
to represent Morgan to the alumni speakers.

337
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,934
就像联络员一样
You know, to act as a liaison,

338
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,413
陪同他们到教室 诸如此类
escort them to the classroom, whatever...

339
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,023
你真的是疯了
You have really lost it.

340
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,922
Dougherty夫人给我说了你那事儿
Then there is that matter that Mrs. Dougherty broached to me.

341
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,324
- 候选者  - 对
- The substitute? - Yeah.

342
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,886
在学校是抽烟是要开除学籍的
Smoking on campus is automatic suspension.

343
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,765
这是我最不想干的事
This is the last thing I wanna do.

344
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,601
没问题 开除学籍 就这样了
No problem. Suspension it is. Done. Effective...

345
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,729
好的 我去
Fine. Fine.

346
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,741
- 我会去的  - 很好 很好
- I'll do it. - Great. Great.

347
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,868
我们会把计划书
We'll be sending out an e-mail

348
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,404
和你的工作任务发邮件给你
with your schedule and your responsibilities.

349
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,762
你是Dustin吗
Are you Dustin?

350
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,905
对
Yeah.

351
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,699
我是George 我是你的联络员
Hi. I'm George. I'm your liaison.

352
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,606
你好
Hey.

353
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,313
我是Dustin Heath
My name is Dustin Heath.

354
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
我曾经是这里的学生
I'm a student. I was a student here.

355
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,717
我和那个可怕的老头儿在一个班
I was in the class with that terrifying old man over there.

356
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,653
我是艺术家
Yeah, I'm an artist.

357
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,547
说实话 我也不知道我在这里做什么
Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing here.

358
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,150
他们打电话邀请我来那会儿我宿醉还没醒呢
Was a little hungover when they called me and asked me to do this

359
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,321
我想快点挂电话然后就同意了
and I said yes just to get them off the phone.

360
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,729
几天后我就收到了计划书
I got the schedule in the mail several days later

361
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,391
然后我就有点尴尬
and I was a little embarrassed.

362
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,096
我没有什么成就
I'm not really established or anything.

363
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,600
一年前我第一次办艺术展 挺不错
I had my first art show a year ago, which was good.

364
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,974
买了这件外套
Got me this coat.

365
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,117
我给你们看一些我的作品吧
Well, let me show you some of my work here.

366
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,813
我不知道 有时人们认为你的作品
I don't know, sometimes people look at your stuff

367
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,085
他们认为很有趣
and, you know, they think it's really interesting

368
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,558
或者就是一坨狗屎
or they think it's bullshit,

369
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,755
我不知道两者的区别 确实不知
and I don't know the difference. I honestly don't.

370
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,931
我想 只要不欺骗自己就行 了
You just, you know, hope not to be fooling yourself, I guess.

371
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,837
这是下一张
This is the next slide, here.

372
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,940
你们有问题吗
Anybody have any questions?

373
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,646
没人问我问题 我刚是不是太差劲了
I mean, nobody asked me any questions. Did I just suck?

374
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,770
你是今天发言者中
You were probably the only real,

375
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,708
最真材实料 毫不浮夸的人
non-full-of-shit person speaking today.

376
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,752
就像原子弹轰过似的
It felt like Nagasaki in there.

377
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,321
你很棒
You were great.

378
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,523
谢谢 哥们
Thanks, man.

379
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,621
你也画画吗
Do you paint?

380
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,524
对 我喜欢画画
Yeah, I'd like to.

381
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,260
只是不知道画什么
I just don't know what to paint.

382
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,730
知道吗 这才是最艰难的 
Yeah, well, it's the hardest part, you know?

383
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,002
这会让我成不了画家吗
Does that make me not a painter?

384
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,100
你所追求的事实才是作画的真谛
The fact that you struggle with it is a really good thing.

385
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,240
但你不作画又怎能自称画家
But how can you call yourself a painter if you don't paint?

386
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,714
- 你喜欢摩根学校么  - 不是很喜欢
- You like Morgan? - Not really.

387
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,484
我不知道在这干什么
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

388
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,558
我想没有人知道 George
I don't think anybody does, George.

389
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,623
至少你敢于承认
At least you admit it.

390
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,012
如果愿意 你可以来我
If you want, you can come to

391
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:56,893
布鲁克林的工作室 看一些作品
my studio in Brooklyn and check some stuff out.

392
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,465
你准备假期一直闲逛吗
You sticking around for the holidays?

393
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,577
不 去圣巴特岛 玩家庭游艇
Nah. St. Bart's. Family yacht.

394
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,679
这样
Oh.

395
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,275
开玩笑啦 没计划
Kidding. No plans.

396
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,116
你真杯具
You're a loser.

397
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,854
我也是 咱俩应该出去玩玩
Well, me, too. We should hang out.

398
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,288
也许吧
Maybe.

399
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,127
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

400
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,108
- 你好 - 你好
- Hi. - Hey.

401
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,805
我们能进去吗
Should we come in?

402
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,748
请进
Please.

403
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,750
你好
Hi.

404
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,128
太棒了 这些作品画了多长时间
These are amazing. How long did they take?

405
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,992
它们风格迥异 
They're all kind of different, you know?

406
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,359
每一幅作品都经历了
Each one goes through its

407
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,166
自身的死亡与重生
own little process of death and rebirth.

408
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,528
那一幅用了两小时
That one literally took me two hours.

409
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,334
他们都是实实在在的
They're all their own little entities, really.

410
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,310
- 你住这里吗  - 嗯
- You live here, too? - Mm-hmm.

411
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,980
太简陋了
It's so simple.

412
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,310
这无关舒适 你懂吗
It's not about comfort, really, you know?

413
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,751
你多大了
You... How old are you?

414
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,256
十八岁
18.

415
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,158
不会吧
No.

416
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,499
每次我有了灵感
Every time I think about a subject,

417
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,626
甚至去构想一幅自认为应该画的东西
or even try to visualize an image of what I think I should paint,

418
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,262
我觉得自己就像一坨狗屎
I just feel like I'm full of shit,

419
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,603
像我根本不是我自己一样
like I'm trying to be something I'm not.

420
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,336
George 这就是你的本性

Really? No, they're just doodles, you know, immature crap.

423
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,045
不 哥们 这就是你要作的东西
No, man. This is what you should be painting.

424
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,146
至少你要加入别的东西
At least until you evolve

425
00:26:29,147 --> 00:26:30,815
才能使其完整 知道我的意思吧
into something else, you know what I mean?

426
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,390
但是你得一直练习
But you gotta exercise the muscle

427
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,527
即使你没有什么感觉 知道我的意思吧
even if you're not feeling it, you know what I mean?

428
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,188
你只要 你得实实在在的做 否则它永远不会出现
You just... You gotta do it or else it'll never happen.

我不会打她注意的
I'll leave that alone.

440

I mean, he's amazing. Really talented. Don't you think?

442
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,975
都是些跟风之作 我不确定他是否货真价实
A little derivative. I'm not sure he's the real deal.

443
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,215
是吗 我觉得他就是
Really? He seemed like it to me.

444

我是说 他是你的导师
I mean, he's a mentor to you now.

445
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,489
- 你不兴奋吗  - 我认为他有点爱吹牛
- Aren't you psyched? - I think he's a bit of a blowhard.

446
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,057
你太怪了
You're so weird.

没有
Nope.

It's not a big deal, but I've never been to one of these before.

492
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,616

Careful.

530

这是终极解药
This is the cure to end all cures.

531
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,320
我爸经常放个生鸡蛋更有效果
My daddy used to put a raw egg in his to really get the effects.

532
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,287
- 你要加蛋吗  - 不用了
- You want an egg? - No.

533
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,158
这是醒酒液
You've heard of a hair of the dog?

534

妈妈 你在做什么
Mom, what are you doing?

538
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,771
你得滋补一下嘛 坏脾气小姐
But you have to have a coalminer's tonic, Miss Grumpy.

539
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,606
就像疫苗一样
It's like a vaccine.

540
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,605
我不管了 我回房间
I can't deal. I'm going back to bed.

541
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,487
她起床比斗牛犬还凶

So do I.

544
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,750
Sal 我认为你不能在他身上浪费时间了
Sal, I don't think you should be messing around with him.

545
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,448
你是在给我约会建议吗
Are you giving me dating advice?

546
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,123
我只是认为你应该和适合自己的对象约会
I just think you should be going out with someone your own speed.

547
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,887
别担心 我们只是朋友
Don't worry, we're just friends.

548
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,497
这才是我担心的
That's exactly what worries me.

549
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,602
Charlotte 我不评论你的社交生活
Charlotte, I don't comment on your social life.

550
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,068
你也无权评论我的
You hardly have the right to comment on mine.

551
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,800
- 我看到了他看你的眼神  - 天呐
- I've seen the way he looks at you. - Jesus.

552
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,669
他对此的感觉没那么简单
This all means something much more to him.

553
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,445
相信我 我一辈子都在游戏感情
Trust me, I've played with their affections my whole life.

554
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,045
但面对真感情 就不能玩了
But with the good ones, it's not right.

555
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,823
那是你的做法 我和你不一样
That's what you do. It's not what I'm doing.

556
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,733
这个创意不错 
This is a great idea, by the way.

557
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,036
几个月后我有一个画展
I got a show coming up in a couple of months.

558
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,163
我需要一些灵感 知道吧
I needed some inspiration, you know?

559
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,332
一流的作品
Big time.

560
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,505
你喜欢这个吗
Do you like this?

561
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,977
我理解它 你呢
I get it. Do you?

562
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,116
我认为任何人都可以
I think anyone could turn this out,

563
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,776
但是为何想要理解它
except why would they want to?

564
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,283
它说明了什么
What's it saying?

565
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,910
使空间看起来更大 知道吗
Makes a room look great, though, you know?

566
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,154
看上去像钱
It looks like money.

567
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,728
上帝
Oh, God.

568
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,360
这对我来说就像天堂
This is heaven to me.

569
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,269
确实很棒
Pretty great.

570
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,764
它让你立马感受到某些东西 你知道我的意思吧
This makes you feel something instantly, you know what I mean?

571
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,137
比如生气
Like anger

572
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,143
或者愤怒
or wrath.

573
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,145
性欲
Lust.

574
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,721
你和Sally怎么样了 有进展不
So, how's it going with our friend Sally? Make any moves?

575
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,227
她对我不感兴趣
She hasn't shown any interest.

576
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,691
那你呢
Well, have you?

577
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,869
你是怎么想的
What do you think, she's

578
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,098
她会满世界的说爱你吗
gonna go around wearing a sign around her neck?

579
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,532
女人喜欢被追求
Women love being desired.

580
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,299
你只需把她推到墙上 然后吻她
You just go throw her up against the wall, start kissing her.

581
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,499
她回吻说明有戏
Chances are she'll kiss you back.

582
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,169
如果没有 至少你尝试过
And if she doesn't, then at least you tried.

583
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:00,542
你得跨出一步 否则你会失去她
You gotta do something or you might lose her.

584
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,527
你喜欢这个
You love this.

585
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,169
这个不错
No, it's good.

586
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:27,004
迷恋客观事物 挺适合你的
Fetishizing an object. That suits you.

587
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:45,087
难以置信我们也会随大流
I can't believe we're participating in this consumer circle jerk.

588
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,322
单身者今晚需要紧紧相随
The dateless need to stick together tonight.

589
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,695
像幸存者一样相拥取暖
We're like survivors huddling for warmth.

590
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,700
你一定过了好几次情人节
You've probably had so many Valentines.

591
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,268
这是委婉的说我水性杨花吗
Is that some kind of euphemism for slut?

592
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,977
印象最深的是和我爸爸
The one I remember most was my dad.

593
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:03,837
在哪
Where was that?

594
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,643
离开田纳西州之前
It was before we left Tennessee.

595
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,980
我6岁 他已经走了
I was six and he had already left,

596
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:11,210
但是他经常回来
but he'd come back every so often.

597
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,821
他骑着摩托载着我呼啸而过 
He roared up on his motorcycle, took me out alone.

598
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,417
晚饭时用薄饼蘸着巧克力糖浆
We had pancakes with chocolate syrup at a diner, at night.

599
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,496
他都让我点餐
He let me order.

600
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,900
你爸爸在哪
Where's your father?

601
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,603
在北京 他几年前为了挣钱去的
Beijing. He moved there years ago for the economic boom.

602
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,575
你们联系过吗
You guys have a relationship?

603
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,079
他填支票 支付我的学费
He checks in, pays my tuition.

604
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,528
但是我们之间差别太大
But we couldn't be more different.

605
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:41,808
我认为他有点失望
I think he's a little disappointed.

606
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:49,090
我7岁时和他在东京待过一段时间
I spent some time in Tokyo with him when I was seven.

607
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:52,693
他在那里经营公司 每天工作12 14小时
He was running a company there, working 12, 14 hours a day.

608
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,453
所以我有了一个
So, I had this full-time

609
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:56,561
不会说英语的全职保姆
Japanese babysitter who didn't speak English.

610
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,895
我们根本不能理解对方
We couldn't understand each other at all.

611
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,795
很快 她厌倦了照顾我
Pretty soon, she ran out of things to do with me

612
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,873
而她也不许我离开酒店
and I ended up never leaving the hotel room.

613
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,135
我就像一头小牛
I was like a veal.

614
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,472
你小时候什么样
What were you like as a child?

615
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,179
比我现在好多了
I was such a better person than I am now.

616
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,179
- 得了吧  - 没开玩笑
- Come on. - I'm serious.

617
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,759
我快乐 开放 好奇 
I was happy, I was open, I was curious.

618
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,890
但我告诉你 我知道何时会结束
But I'll tell you this, I knew when it was ending.

619
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,059
当我意识到我要改变
I was overwhelmed with

620
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,330
意识到这比看上去还糟糕
sadness when I realized that I was gonna change

621
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,597
被悲伤击垮的时候就会结束了
and that it was all most likely gonna get worse.

622
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,307
比如现在的思乡之情 我无法摆脱它
Like a nostalgia for the present, I couldn't shake it.

623
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,079
什么
What?

624
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,381
我很奇怪 对吧
I'm weird, right?

625
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,351
不
No.

626
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,519
你不奇怪
No, you're not.

627
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,390
奇怪的是我这么久
It's weird not having a boyfriend.

628
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,092
都没有男朋友
It's been so long.

629
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:06,738
因为你都高三了
That's because it's the

630
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:09,027
都是些比你小的师弟
first year at school nobody's older than you.

631
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,640
资源稀缺啊
Your pool dried up.

632
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,868
- 你怎么知道 －我是一个细心的人
- How do you know that? - I'm a very insightful person.

633
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,610
你做过么
Have you ever had sex?

634
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,881
当然 很多
Yeah, tons.

635
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,820
说真的 有过吗
No, really. Have you?

636
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,817
你为什么这么问
Why are you asking me this?

637
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,992
你知道我没有过
You know I haven't.

638
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,728
哦 我不知道 我只是有点好奇
Well, I don't know, I'm just wondering.

639
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,705
你是否想过和我
Have you ever thought about me?

640
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:46,901
什么意思
What do you mean?

641
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:52,239
你知道我在说什么 你有没有想过和我
You know what I mean. Have you ever thought about it?

642
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,746
你说这些干嘛
Why are you doing this?

643
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,021
你会和我上床么
Will you have sex with me?

644
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,993
开个玩笑啦
I'm just kidding.

645
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,502
糟糕的主意
Bad idea.

646
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,405
那样也太怪了
I mean, can you imagine how weird that would be?

647
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,346
你是我唯一的知心朋友
You're my only real friend.

648
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,518
不能毁了这段友情
Let's not ruin it.

649
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,256
我们是不是该找Will和Zoe一起开房
Should we check in with Will and Zoe?

650
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,071
George?

651
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,741
George?

652
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,468
我得走了
I have to go.

653
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,441
什么
What?

654
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,346
我不舒服
I'm not feeling well.

655
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,951
好吧 那我们明天见
Okay. Well, will I see you tomorrow?

656
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,020
不清楚
I don't know.

657
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,922
这个是不对的 它只是玩笑
This is wrong. It's a joke.

658
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,391
George 你想多了
You think too much, George!

659
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,045
出去
Get out.

660
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,219
George 你怎么回事 为什么你不在学校
George? What is going on? Why aren't you at school?

661
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,862
我在家当然就
If you speak even the most

662
00:48:12,863 --> 00:48:14,714
不在学校了 
rudimentary form of the English language,

663
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:15,847
这么简单的逻辑都不懂
then you'll understand this,

664
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,585
让我自己待会
leave me alone.

665
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,828
你刚才和我说什么
What did you just say to me?

666
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,726
Vivian 我说得很清楚
Vivian, my voice is calm.

667
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,233
我现在是一个游离的思考个体
I'm a free-thinking individual

668
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,633
不参与你的话题
who chooses not to be engaged in this discussion.

669
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,939
请离开
Please.

670
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,076
George 你在做什么
George, what are you doing?

671
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,646
Jack 对不起 我现在需要自己呆会
I'm sorry, Jack. I need to be left alone right now.

672
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,182
你的功课怎么样
What about your work?

673
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,942
我现在不想做
I just can't do it right now.

674
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,114
我现在正痛苦呢
I'm going through something.

675
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,689
真可悲
That's pathetic.

676
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:24,994
但至少是事实
At least it's the truth.

677
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,192
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

678
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,530
- 你好 － 你好
- Hey. - Hey.

679
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,934
- 你怎么样 － 很好
- How are you? - Good.

680
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,206
不错
That's good.

681
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,837
一切  一切都好么
Everything... Everything all right?

682
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,969
没错 挺好  一切都好
Yeah. Yeah, everything's all right.

683
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,683
George 怎么样 他没有回我的电话
How's George? He hasn't returned my calls.

684
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,617
对 这正是我要和你讨论的
Yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.

685
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,317
他也不和我说话
He's not exactly speaking to me either.

686
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,894
- 为什么 发生了什么 - 我也不知道
- Why? What happened? - I don't know.

687
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,987
你知道George
You know George.

688
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,559
我想 他是比较难懂的
He's complicated, I guess.

689
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,037
嗯
Yeah.

690
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,630
我好奇
I was wondering,

691
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,234
对你而言 我不止是George的朋友吧
I'm not just George's friend to you, am I?

692
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:34,453
Sally 你和George应该在一起
You and George should be together, Sally.

693
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,482
我们只是朋友
We're just friends.

694
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,528
不可能
There's no such thing.

695
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,498
我喜欢这首曲子
I love this song.

696
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,532
跳舞吧
You wanna dance?

697
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,601
来吧
Come on.

698
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,816
怎么
What?

699
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,682
我们不应该这样
We shouldn't be doing this.

700
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,961
- 我们只是跳舞 - 是么
- We're just dancing. - Oh, yeah?

701
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,948
George.

702
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:37,946
我一直等你的论文呢
Been looking forward to

703
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:40,247
今天最后一天了
reading your Hardy paper. Today's the day.

704
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,916
对不起 我还没有做
Sorry, I don't have it.

705
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,388
George 这是你的毕业论文
George, this was your final project of the year.

706
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,296
交论文 然后年终考试 我多么希望你能毕业
After this, there's just exams. How am I supposed to grade you?

707
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,063
我保证 我下周交
I'll have it to you by next week, I promise.

708
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,136
那似乎不行
That's not gonna be good enough.

709
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,005
Pal 你好
Hey, pal.

710
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,051
我召集这个会议是因为你的老师们反映
I called this meeting because your teachers have reported to me

711
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,958
你还是不做作业
that you continue to refuse to do the course work.

712
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,429
你一点都不努力
You have made zero effort

713
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,726
在摩根学校这里虚度光阴
to turn your career here at Morgan around.

714
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,467
是 没错
Yes, I did.

715
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,960
我是说 最初我也努力过
I mean, I did struggle

716
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:29,800
但是我没有做到
with it at the beginning, but I just couldn't.

717
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,328
好 你没有时间了
Well, you are out of time.

718
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:35,431
决定你未来的时刻已经到了
The moment to decide your future has arrived.

719
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:41,631
现在 根据这些老师们的建议
Now, against the recommendation of some in this room,

720
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,602
我让你自己选择
I'm giving you a choice.

721
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:46,102
第一开除
First is expulsion.

722
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,373
如果这是你想要的
It's yours if you want it.

723
00:53:48,612 --> 00:53:49,977
第二选择
Second option,

724
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:52,025
如果你想毕业
if you want to graduate,

725
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:55,181
你补齐所有你落下的作业
you make up every single assignment you missed.

726
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,980
所有的论文 练习
Every paper, every exercise.

727
00:53:57,087 --> 00:54:00,318
也就是说相当一年的作业
Essentially, a year's worth of homework.

728
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:05,327
漏了一个 就没有毕业证书
If even one is missing on graduation day, no diploma.

729
00:54:07,865 --> 00:54:09,833
你还有3周多一点的时间
You have a little over three weeks.

730
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:12,673
George 我过去坚信
George, I used to believe

731
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:15,204
你比其他人有潜力
you had more potential than anyone else here.

732
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:17,240
但你从没证明给我看 哪怕一次也没
But you never delivered, not once.

733
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,532
我以前从来都不浪费时间对你发火
I wasn't gonna waste the time getting mad at you.

734
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,735
现在我也不想浪费时间维护你
I'm not gonna waste the time defending you now.

735
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:30,949
暂不提你对老师的不尊重 George
Forget the lack of respect you show, George.

736
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:36,816
这就是度过我们的人生的方式
This is the way we make our living, how we spend our lives.

737
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:40,028
但是你从来不关心这里发生的一切
But you simply don't care what goes on around here.

738
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:42,824
为什么我们还要以德报怨
Why would we continue to reward that?

739
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:46,468
你是对的
You're right.

740
00:54:47,604 --> 00:54:48,969
我不该这样对你们
You shouldn't reward it.

741
00:54:52,176 --> 00:54:54,474
我真的不知道该说什么
I honestly don't know what to say.

742
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:57,844
也许应该退学
Maybe it should be expulsion.

743
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,750
你还是下周一告诉我们
Let us know on Monday.

744
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:04,984
好 行
All right. All right.

745
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,879
谢谢
Thank you.

746
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,396
你们告知我的父母没
Did you tell my parents about this?

747
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:20,930
是 George 必须的
Yes, George, I had to.

748
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:34,484
嘿
Hey.

749
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,018
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

750
00:55:37,855 --> 00:55:40,915
是我的错  我一直忙着
Is it my fault? I mean, I've had a lot on my mind and...

751
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,390
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

752
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:46,496
我认为我做不到
I don't think I can do it.

753
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:49,532
哦 什么意思 不是还有另外一种选择
Well, what do you mean? What other choice is there?

754
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:51,032
妈妈 我不确信我能做到
Mom, I'm not sure that I can.

755
00:55:51,033 --> 00:55:52,568
你不得不去做
You're just gonna have to do it.

756
00:55:52,669 --> 00:55:55,160
你应该坐下然后去完成
You're just gonna have to sit down and just do it!

757
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:56,739
妈妈 我尝试坦诚的和你说
Mom, I'm trying to speak to you honestly.

758
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:59,741
我不在乎 我已经受够了你的谎言
I don't care! I'm done listening to your lies!

759
00:55:59,877 --> 00:56:01,208
拜托 这事不可能办得到的
Come on, that's really the way to fix this!

760
00:56:01,311 --> 00:56:04,712
George 这是你的问题 你闯的祸
Hey, George! This is your mess, and it's a disaster.

761
00:56:05,082 --> 00:56:06,515
Jack 你说的对 是我的事
You're right, Jack. It is my mess.

762
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:08,778
我解决我的问题 你处理好你自己的
I'll handle my mess, you handle yours.

763
00:56:09,386 --> 00:56:11,013
- 行 注意你的口气  - 等等 Viv 
- Okay, watch that tone. - Wait, Viv.

764
00:56:12,556 --> 00:56:13,784
什么意思
What does that mean?

765
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:16,393
我是说 你想告诉我们
I mean, you wanna tell us where you've been spending your days

766
00:56:16,493 --> 00:56:17,926
你这个冬天这些天在哪里度过的
for a couple of months this past winter?

767
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:20,930
你的问题处理得怎么样了
What's going on with your disaster?

768
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:22,928
电话断了 我们支付不起电费
Phone gets shut off. We can't pay the electricity.

769
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:25,058
家具一个个逐渐在消失
Furniture is disappearing around here piece by piece.

770
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:27,735
George 住口 你不明白
George, stop it. You don't understand.

771
00:56:27,905 --> 00:56:28,894
那你呢
Do you?

772
00:56:29,773 --> 00:56:31,900
那你知道Jack 这几周都在街上流浪
Do you know that Jack was wandering the streets for weeks,

773
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:33,476
假装去上班
pretending to go to work?

774
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,269
Jack 你解决这个问题了么
Did you get that sorted out, Jack?

775
00:56:35,379 --> 00:56:36,588
或者像一个无家可归的人在
Or are you still working out

776
00:56:36,589 --> 00:56:38,576
咖啡店想办法
of a coffee shop booth like a homeless person?

777
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:39,805
Jack 住手
Jack, stop!

778
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:42,745
别打了
Stop it!

779
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:46,353
Jack 住手
Jack! Stop!

780
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,284
放开我
Get off!

781
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:55,856
George!

782
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:10,478
Sally!

783
00:57:11,882 --> 00:57:13,315
Sally?

784
00:57:16,286 --> 00:57:17,719
George!

785
00:57:19,623 --> 00:57:21,420
怎么啦 怎么了
What's going on? What happened?

786
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,873
怎么回事
What's wrong?

787
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:42,337
为什么
What is it?

788
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:02,864
George.

789
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,890
嘿 George
George, hey.

790
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:09,736
我只是想确认你是否还好
I just wanted to make sure you're all right.

791
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,478
George 我真的也不好过
I had a really hard time, George.

792
00:58:16,346 --> 00:58:19,144
我发誓 我保证 我
I swear. I promise, I...

793
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,846
我以为你说不会打她主意
I thought you were gonna leave it alone.

794
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:25,987
我不是要说对不起
I'm not gonna say sorry.

795
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:30,957
是我不会更好么
Isn't it better that it's me?

796
00:58:31,695 --> 00:58:34,721
相比那些他刚认识的惹人厌的家伙
As opposed to some douche bag she just met

797
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:38,063
这样你还不能正视她么
and wouldn't even let you look at her?

798
00:58:39,036 --> 00:58:40,560
你还想我说谢谢嘛
You want me to thank you?

799
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,497
我的确对她有感觉
I actually felt something.

800
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:46,612
这个并不总是发生
That doesn't always happen.

801
00:58:46,613 --> 00:58:48,737
已经很久没有这样的感觉了
It hasn't happened in a very long time.

802
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:50,680
我已经等的够久了
And I've lived long enough

803
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:53,883
我知道我应该立刻行动
to know that when it does, you should act on it.

804
00:58:57,321 --> 00:58:58,948
我认为你没有准备好
I didn't think you were ready.

805
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:07,491
我曾经认为你很酷
I thought you were so cool.

806
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,391
我从来没有遇到这么酷的人
I never meet anyone cool.

807
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:55,576
嗨
Hi.

808
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,239
嗨
Hi.

809
00:59:58,015 --> 00:59:59,414
我不想呆在那里
I didn't want to be up there.

810
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:02,612
那里是不太好呆
Can't have been fun for you.

811
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:08,351
他摔断了锁骨 我们一整夜都在急症室
He broke his collarbone. We were in the ER all night.

812
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:12,823
我很抱歉 这本不该发生的
I'm so sorry. That should have never happened.

813
01:00:12,996 --> 01:00:14,657
妈妈 是我先挑起的
Mom, I started it.

814
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:18,366
他可都50岁了
He's a 50-year-old man.

815
01:00:19,136 --> 01:00:20,501
他应该保护你的
He's supposed to protect you.

816
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:22,629
妈妈 是我的错 我很无礼
Mom, I'm obnoxious, I'm deeply disrespectful.

817
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:24,502
我们要离婚
We're getting a divorce.

818
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:37,682
不必如此 我确定他不会再这样了
Come on, I'm sure he'll never do it again.

819
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,457
既然他知道我能弄到他住院
Now that he knows I can hospitalize him.

820
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:47,022
我们早就走到那一步了
We were already headed there.

821
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:50,361
一年前他做生意破产了
His business went bankrupt about a year ago,

822
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:54,233
我想我应该相信他 支持他
and I thought I should have faith in him and support him.

823
01:00:54,438 --> 01:00:58,306
但是他总是找借口
But there was always some sort of excuse,

824
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:01,409
总是说他会时来运转的
or his luck was about to turn.

825
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:04,639
然后说服我把房子做抵押
So, he convinced me to mortgage the apartment,

826
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,545
再然后是我的生意
and then my own business.

827
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:08,943
但总是不够
But it was never enough.

828
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:13,717
他就是个混蛋 我早该告诉你的
He's a sick man, and I should have told you,

829
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:15,506
但是你压力太大
but you were under enough

830
01:01:15,507 --> 01:01:17,556
我不想再让你心烦意乱了
pressure and I didn't wanna distract you.

831
01:01:17,794 --> 01:01:19,318
心烦意乱也不错
I like distractions.

832
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:22,489
现在更严重了
It gets worse.

833
01:01:27,871 --> 01:01:29,338
我得把房子卖了
I have to sell the apartment.

834
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,172
你说什么
What?

835
01:01:31,975 --> 01:01:35,433
我的信用卡再也支撑不起这些债务了
The debt has erased my credit.

836
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,263
我该怎么办
What am I gonna do?

837
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:02,599
我答应了
I'll do it.

838
01:02:03,206 --> 01:02:04,571
别挂机
Hold on.

839
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:06,540
你只有三周时间了
You have three weeks.

840
01:02:06,743 --> 01:02:09,177
而且你还得上学 还要期末考
And you still have to come to school and take finals.

841
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:10,880
知道了没
You know that already?

842
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:13,822
找你老师要以往的作业
Pick up your assignment packets

843
01:02:13,823 --> 01:02:16,012
少了一份 休想拿到毕业证
from your teachers. You miss one, no diploma.

844
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:18,414
- 知道了 - 出去吧
- Okay. - Go.

845
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:24,222
我考虑了很久 George
I've given this a lot of thought, George.

846
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:26,520
我不认为我会宽容你
I don't think I'm being easy on you.

847
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,597
我也不相信那些沉闷无趣的作业
I simply don't believe that dull, lifeless assignments

848
01:02:29,733 --> 01:02:32,258
可以用来衡量一个人的灵魂
are the measures of a person's soul.

849
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:36,504
我只要一张
I want one,

850
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:39,141
有意义的画作
one meaningful work from you.

851
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:42,209
我要你审视自我 倾听心声
I want you to look in the mirror, listen to your gut,

852
01:02:42,446 --> 01:02:46,610
与真实的自己对话
and make an image that speaks to the real you.

853
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,477
你在乎什么 相信什么
What you care about. What you believe.

854
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,380
可高山 可流水
It can be big, it can be small.

855
01:02:55,459 --> 01:02:57,825
就算画得再糟糕
It can be painted in bat shit.

856
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:01,455
只要真诚无惧就可以
As long as it's honest and fearless.

857
01:03:02,899 --> 01:03:04,833
Harris 你的帮助我实在是无以为报
Harris, you have no idea how much this helps...

858
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:07,469
停 停 以免你误会
But! But. The caveat.

859
01:03:07,671 --> 01:03:09,366
假若我觉得不对头
If I smell a rat,

860
01:03:09,606 --> 01:03:11,180
你还是没能找到
if you didn't find something

861
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:13,599
你一直没有勇气说的东西
you've never had the courage to say before,

862
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:16,938
我是不会让你过的 你绝对毕不了业
I don't pass you. You don't get out of here.

863
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,872
你的前途将化作乌有
All your work down the drain.

864
01:03:21,518 --> 01:03:23,645
走吧 快 现在可以走了
Now, go, get out of here.

865
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,190
你还好吧
How are you?

866
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:32,558
你和Jack没啥事吧
How are things with Jack?

867
01:03:33,463 --> 01:03:35,363
真搞不懂 我和Dustin交往有什么问题吗
Look, what is so wrong with me seeing Dustin?

868
01:03:35,465 --> 01:03:36,864
他告诉我他不会管的
He told me he was gonna leave it alone.

869
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:38,807
但是你和他说我们没在一起
But you told him we weren't together!

870
01:03:38,808 --> 01:03:39,968
那你指望我说什么
What should I have said?

871
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,560
问题是你想说什么
What did you wanna say?

872
01:03:41,671 --> 01:03:44,009
你又来了 心理游戏总是玩不够
There you go again with the mind games.

873
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,108
背弃信用 残酷成性的贱妇
Treacherous, sadistic little hussy.

874
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:49,667
George 我们之间没什么
George! There was nothing between us.

875
01:03:52,716 --> 01:03:56,277
- 我很抱歉 - 不 你说得对
- I'm sorry. - No. You're right.

876
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,713
我得走了 我要是不把这一年
I gotta go. I have to make up

877
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:04,021
堆积的家庭作业补完 就别想毕业了
a year's worth of homework or I don't graduate.

878
01:04:04,227 --> 01:04:06,525
- 什么 - 祝你和Dustin幸福愉快
- What? - Have fun with Dustin.

879
01:04:08,298 --> 01:04:10,732
介绍你俩认识我真是开心
I'm so pleased to have made the introduction.

880
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:13,802
这里很不错
And it's good.

881
01:04:13,904 --> 01:04:15,667
我们在这里有过几许美好回忆
We've had some great memories here, you know?

882
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:20,675
我们最好快点把这地方租下来
We should definitely look into signing a lease for this place.

883
01:04:20,877 --> 01:04:22,276
- 这太完美了 - 当然 当然
- It's absolutely perfect. - Sure, sure.

884
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:08,480
这间房不错 宝贝
It's a great room. Hi, honey.

885
01:07:11,648 --> 01:07:13,206
我把房子卖了
I think I'm done.

886
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:15,316
我作业也完成了
Me, too.

887
01:07:17,253 --> 01:07:20,416
我们一家人从前过得很快乐
We had a lot of fun in the beginning, you, me, and your father.

888
01:07:21,324 --> 01:07:22,882
我也不知道为什么会变成这样
I don't get what happened.

889
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:25,092
自从爸爸那事之后
After Dad.

890
01:07:25,428 --> 01:07:27,191
物换星移
Things change.

891
01:07:28,098 --> 01:07:30,999
有时候你甚至觉察不到变化
Sometimes so quickly you don't even notice it.

892
01:07:31,868 --> 01:07:33,189
也许吧 幸福
I don't know. Happiness is,

893
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,099
就像你必须照顾好的东西
like, something you have to look after,

894
01:07:35,238 --> 01:07:36,603
要小心翼翼
be vigilant about.

895
01:07:38,508 --> 01:07:40,999
你知道Jack是爱我们的
I mean, you know that Jack loved us.

896
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:43,608
这不是什么黄粱美梦
That wasn't an illusion.

897
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,214
他把你当作儿子般疼爱
He loved you like a son.

898
01:07:47,784 --> 01:07:49,308
你知道他现在在哪里吗
Do you know where he is now?

899
01:07:51,955 --> 01:07:53,320
不知道
No.

900
01:07:56,593 --> 01:07:59,255
对以后的人生有什么想法没
Do you have any idea of what you wanna do?

901
01:08:01,297 --> 01:08:03,162
我想去读艺校
I wanna try and get into an art school.

902
01:08:05,401 --> 01:08:06,732
我需要专业的训练
I need real training.

903
01:08:39,102 --> 01:08:40,626
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

904
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:46,536
一波未平一波又起 我心乱如麻
So much has happened, and so much is happening, and...

905
01:08:47,844 --> 01:08:50,642
我需要你这个朋友 好吗
I just need you to be my friend, okay?

906
01:08:51,781 --> 01:08:54,545
我真的 真的很需要你 求求你了
I really, really need that. Please.

907
01:09:01,991 --> 01:09:04,721
我妈妈要嫁给一个才认识三个月的人
My mom is marrying this guy she's known for three months

908
01:09:04,861 --> 01:09:06,488
还要搬去德州和他住一起
and moving to Texas to be with him.

909
01:09:06,963 --> 01:09:08,897
她已经走了
She's already down there.

910
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:11,863
结婚了 意味着她不能收赡养费了
Getting engaged means her alimony payment stops,

911
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:16,064
也不能供我下年去Boulder读书了
which means she can't pay my tuition for Boulder next year,

912
01:09:16,372 --> 01:09:18,067
这相当于是说我出不去了
which means I don't get out.

913
01:09:19,309 --> 01:09:21,470
她想让我跟她一起搬去德州
She wants me to go live with her in Texas.

914
01:09:22,946 --> 01:09:24,311
那你去吗
What are you gonna do?

915
01:09:25,014 --> 01:09:27,244
这很难决定
That's the hard part.

916
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:31,583
因为我明天就要走了
Because I'm leaving tomorrow.

917
01:09:32,622 --> 01:09:34,112
要去哪
Where are you going?

918
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:38,724
我和Dustin打算夏日背包游欧洲
Dustin and I are gonna backpack around Europe for the summer.

919
01:09:38,928 --> 01:09:41,362
他作品卖出去了 把这送我当礼物
His show sold out. It's his present to me.

920
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:44,559
那毕业典礼怎么办
What about graduation?

921
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:49,670
经历了这么多 我受够了 毕业证书就让他们寄给我吧
After everything, I'm over it. They can mail it to me.

922
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,466
那Zoe和Will他们呢
And Zoe, Will, and...

923
01:09:51,641 --> 01:09:53,108
我很喜欢这些家伙
I love those guys,

924
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:56,211
但那都不是真实的我
but that was never really me.

925
01:09:57,513 --> 01:09:58,878
那游完欧洲之后呢
And after Europe?

926
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:02,577
天知道 反正不会是德州
Who knows? Not Texas.

927
01:10:05,722 --> 01:10:07,087
我必须告诉你些东西
I need to tell you something.

928
01:10:10,994 --> 01:10:12,985
你说得对 某种程度上讲
You were right, in a way.

929
01:10:13,129 --> 01:10:15,689
我不该把话憋着不说的
I should've been able to say what I wanted to.

930
01:10:20,036 --> 01:10:22,971
我爱上你了 已经很久很久了
I'm in love with you. I always have been.

931
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:31,121
我认为是你待我不公平
I thought you were the unfair one,

932
01:10:31,122 --> 01:10:33,181
但是于我而言我也没说
but it was unfair of me not to say it.

933
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,550
所以 我就这么说了
So, I've said it.

934
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:41,221
我一无是处
I was nothing.

935
01:10:42,058 --> 01:10:43,787
我感觉自己一无是处
I felt like nothing.

936
01:10:44,794 --> 01:10:46,193
但是
Less than.

937
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:49,396
你改变了我
You changed that.

938
01:12:05,174 --> 01:12:07,472
你知道我们终有一天会在一起
You know we're gonna be together one day.

939
01:12:08,177 --> 01:12:11,146
我们都必须把身上的糟糕处境解决掉
We have to sort through all of our messed-up issues

940
01:12:11,381 --> 01:12:12,542
而你也只能
and you have to sleep with

941
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,509
多和几个女孩深交才能一吐为快
a lot of girls to get it out of your system.

942
01:12:15,852 --> 01:12:17,547
别走
Don't go.

943
01:12:17,687 --> 01:12:19,245
算我求你
Please.

944
01:12:19,355 --> 01:12:20,845
人生很长
It's a long life.

945
01:12:21,557 --> 01:12:23,115
我们并不孤身一人
We're not done.

946
01:12:28,364 --> 01:12:31,856
背信弃言 残酷成性的贱货
Treacherous, sadistic little hussy.

947
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:38,172
我也爱你
I love you, too.

948
01:13:40,937 --> 01:13:42,302
都在这了
Here it is.

949
01:13:43,806 --> 01:13:45,205
我们会好好看的
We'll see.

950
01:13:46,275 --> 01:13:48,402
我们就到此为止吧
We are getting down to the wire.

951
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:52,710
我也许会喊你名字 又也许不会
I'll either be calling your name or I won't.

952
01:14:30,486 --> 01:14:31,976
你他妈的好样的
Son of a bitch.

她有说她什么时候回来吗
Did she say when she'd be back?

955
01:14:49,105 --> 01:14:51,630
真不敢相信她甚至连电话也不打给我
I can't believe she didn't even call me.

956
01:14:52,608 --> 01:14:54,235
我做错什么了
What did I do?
