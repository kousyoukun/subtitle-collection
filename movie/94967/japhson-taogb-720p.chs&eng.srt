00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:43,818
从人类历史有记录开始
Since the dawn of recorded history,

3
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:45,665
大约有1100亿人
something like 110 billion

4
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,490
在这个世界上出生
human beings have been born into this world.

5
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:52,034
这数字靠单一的个体是不可能完成的
And not a single one of them made it.

6
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:56,003
在这个星球上住着68亿人
There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.

7
00:00:56,242 --> 00:01:00,542
每年大概有6000万人去世  6000万人
Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people.

8
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:04,104
这就可以得出结论 每天有16万人去世
That comes out to about 160,000 per day.

9
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:06,876
我小时候读到这么一句话
I read this quote once when I was a kid,

10
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:08,906
"我们孤单地活着 终将孤单地死去
"We live alone, we die alone.

11
00:01:08,907 --> 00:01:11,423
人生不过一场虚无"
Everything else is just an illusion. "

12
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,759
这话曾让我想到半夜睡不着觉
It used to keep me up at night.

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,391
我们都孤单地活着
We all die alone.

14
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:18,929
那我为什么要
So, why am I supposed to

15
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,557
操劳 艰苦还有挣扎
spend my life working, sweating, struggling?

16
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:23,054
摩根学校

17
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:22,890
当那一切都不过是一场虚无
For an illusion?

18
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:25,861
即使有再多的朋友
Because no amount of friends,

19
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:27,895
再多的女友
no girl,

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,904
再多的满分作业
no assignments about conjugating the pluperfect

21
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,843
或者算出直角三角形斜边的平方根
or determining the square root of the hypotenuse

22
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:35,846
都不能避免我最终离世的命运
is gonna help me avoid my fate.

23
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:39,478
我的生活应当做更有意义的事
I have better things to do with my time.

00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:24,487
? Where the light bends at the cracks?

40
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:27,899
? And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs ?

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,370
? Pretending the echoes belong to someone ?

42
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,505
? Someone I used to know ?

43
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:51,918
? And we become ?

44
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,892
? Silhouettes when our bodies finally go ?

45
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,247
George 作业做完了吗
Do you have your work, George?

46
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,484
- 没  - 为什么
- No. - Why not?

47
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,455
因为我有点沮丧
I was depressed.

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,790
是嘛 怎么回事
Oh, yes? Why was that?

49
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:34,464
因为我意识到我终有一天会死去
Because I realized I'm gonna die one day.

50
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,933
George 我们都会离开人世
We're all gonna die one day, George.

51
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:39,004
我想 这不是你不做三角函数作业
I don't think that's a reasonable excuse

52
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:41,937
的合理解释
for not completing your trigonometry exercise.

53
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,702
我逼迫自己去做了
Well, I was trying to.

54
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:46,845
但我终将死去的事实在我脑海中不断萦绕
I just couldn't shake this awareness of my mortality.

55
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:49,644
世事都变得没有意义
Everything seemed meaningless,

56
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:52,507
很不幸 写作业也包括在内
including the assignment, unfortunately.

57
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,450
你给我去校长办公室
I want you to go to the principal's office

58
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:57,852
去发现写作业的意义
and find meaning in the homework.

59
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,391
并且在期末前把作业交给我
Bring it to me completed by the end of the period.

60
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:22,213
- 你迟到了  - 我写作业太专心了
- You're late. - I was so engrossed in my work.

61
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:24,406
孩子 你又要挨训了
Boy, I wouldn't wanna be you right now.

62
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,985
- 我什么也没做  - 你总是做错事
- I haven't done anything. - You've always done something.

63
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,423
你最好快点去
You better go.

64
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,090
Bill.

65
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:41,894
虽然你是毕业生 有校外活动的特权
Even though you have off-campus privileges as a senior,

66
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,232
如果你被发现在校外吸烟的话
if you are seen anywhere in the city smoking,

67
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:47,396
你的特权将被撤回 即时生效
you have your privileges revoked. Automatic probation.

68
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:49,101
干嘛告诉我这些
Why are you telling me?

69
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:52,777
- 你以为我闻不出来吗  - 随便你
- You think I can't smell? - You can smell all you want.

70
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,513
我们能进入正题了吗
Shall we get down to business?

71
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:57,971
那么开始吧
Yes, we shall.

72
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:03,118
从某种层面说 你的未来决定于接下来几个月的表现
In a way, your future depends on the next few months.

73
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:04,211
不只是为了上大学
Not just for college.

74
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:07,258
而是为你的将来打下基础
I mean, it sets the tone for everything that follows.

75
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,493
我知道你是怎么想的 
Now, I know how you think and I know

76
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,155
你认为现在太晚了 而你又是宿命论者
you're thinking it's too late and you're gonna be a fatalist

77
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:13,663
对现在的一切毫不在乎
and let it all go to hell.

78
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,130
但是 George 如果你坚持你现在所走的路
But, George, if you keep performing the way you are,

79
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:20,171
就别想毕业了 更别说上大学了
forget about college, forget about graduating, even.

80
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:22,663
所以
So,

81
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:26,373
这次只是处以警告 再有下次就是开除学籍了
this counts as your official warning. Suspension is next.

82
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:28,777
下次应该是留校察看吧
I thought probation was next.

83
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:33,243
别威胁我 这不管用
Don't play the angles, George. They won't work.

84
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:35,479
也别开玩笑
Neither do jokes.

85
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:36,577
我没开玩笑
I wasn't joking.

86
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,881
我知道你很有才华
I know you're capable.

87
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:45,286
我积极性方面真的很成问题
I have a real problem with motivating.

88
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:48,460
但我想我会设法克服
But I think I can do it.

89
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,125
我会努力的
I'll try.

90
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,328
好吧 可以出去了
All right, go.

91
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,665
不要让我失望了
And don't make me regret it.

92
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,098
谁在天台上吸烟
Who's smoking up here?

93
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,735
George 你知道你在干什么吗
George! What do you think you're doing?

94
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:37,448
对不起 我
Sorry. I...

95
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,649
我今天真的很不顺
I was having a tough day.

96
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:41,811
我承受的压力很大 Dougherty夫人 
I guess the stress finally got to me, Mrs. Dougherty.

97
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,150
George 为什么要吸烟
George, why do you do these things?

98
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:46,886
谢谢你
Thank you.

99
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:49,688
什么压力
Now, what do you mean by stress?

100
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:09,239
- 嗨 - 嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

101
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:13,951
- 我收到了你学校发来的邮件  - 天哪
- I got an e-mail from your school. - Oh, Jesus.

102
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,786
类似于留校察看
Some kind of academic probation?

103
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,719
我能帮你吗
Can I help you?

104
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:25,388
要不请个家庭教师或者私立大学的导师
Can I get you a tutor or a private college advisor?

105
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:29,861
如果你考不进一个像样的学校
If you don't get into a decent school,

106
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,835
我都不知道你能不能找到工作了
then I don't know how you're gonna get a job.

107
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:34,462
我自己能处理
I have it under control.

108
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:39,204
亲爱的 如果你考不进一个像样的大学
Honey, if you don't get into a decent college...

109
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:42,769
- 我看电视去了  - 不准去
- I'm gonna go watch TV. - No, you will not watch TV.

110
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,109
呆在这
You will stay here

111
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:47,413
直到我们想出切实可行的方案
till we can come up with a plan for getting you into college.

112
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,248
我今天在学校过得很不顺 我很累了
I had a hard day at school, I'm tired,

113
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:51,982
我现在想要休息半个小时
and I'm gonna go relax now for half an hour.

114
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:56,327
然后我就去做作业 可以吗
Then I will do my work. Okay?

115
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:06,901
George?

116
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,064
TMD你在干什么
The fuck are you doing?

117
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,400
画画
I'm drawing.

118
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:16,207
你这臭小子 找到素描素材了没
Are you sketching your subject, you little shit?

119
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:17,881
是的
Yes.

120
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:26,885
- Harris 我没有素材 - 见鬼 为什么没有
- I don't have a subject, Harris. - Why the heck not?

121
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:28,993
不知道
I don't know.

122
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,722
George 你要善于发掘身边的事物
George, you're going to have to start digging around in there,

123
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,855
那样才能开发自身的潜能
so you can develop that talent of yours,

124
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:36,264
才能有想法
so you can start to use that brain of yours

125
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,632
去表达内心深处的美丽
to express that beautiful heart of yours.

126
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:42,236
好好想想你要传达的是什么 然后画出来
So, figure out what you want to say, and say it.

127
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:45,399
- Harris  - 嗯
- Harris. - Yes.

128
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:48,341
我没有什么要传达的
I don't have anything to say.

129
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,416
用心去找
Find something!

130
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,129
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

131
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:09,994
- 我是Sally  - 我知道
- I'm Sally. - I know.

132
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:11,569
谢谢你替我顶罪
Thanks for covering for me.

133
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,763
不用谢
No problem.

134
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:16,033
为什么那么做
Why did you?

135
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:18,766
不知道
I don't know.

136
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:20,411
你特立独行
You were doing something so renegade,

137
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:21,945
不该因教条受到惩罚
I thought you deserved to get away with it.

138
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:24,877
我三天两头被叫到办公室
I run afoul of the authorities so often,

139
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,543
处理这样的事比你有经验
I figured I could handle it better than you.

140
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:30,750
你真的很怪
You're really weird.

141
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:36,861
为什么一直不写作业
So, why don't you ever do your work?

142
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:39,020
有那么多比写作业更重要的事去做
There are so many more important things to think about,

143
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,565
于是写作业就可做可不做了
homework ends up seeming like an afterthought.

144
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:43,761
注意力不足过动症吗
Add?

145
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,700
不 他们做了所有的努力
No, they tried everything.

146
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:48,568
利他林 普能 导师 心理治疗
Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy.

147
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:48,454
利他林(中枢兴奋药)   立普能(抗忧郁药)

148
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:51,472
不起作用的 我就像懒虫中的战斗机
Nothing worked. I'm the Teflon slacker.

149
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:56,470
其实我们每个人都在死去 你懂不
No, it's more like, we're living in a dying time, you know?

150
00:09:56,582 --> 00:10:00,348
全球变暖 战争 恐怖行动还有海啸
I mean, you got global warming, wars, terrorism, tsunamis.

151
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:03,512
- 好了  - 我们整个社会正在走向衰落
- Okay... - We're definitely on the downhill side.

152
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:06,553
那我们努力活着为了什么 有什么用呢
So, what are we working towards? What's the point?

153
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:10,291
我也会恐惧 但是都没你那样的
I thought I had fears, but they're pretty run-of-the-mill.

154
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,295
- 我惧怕痛苦还有死亡  - 我不害怕这些
- Pain, death. - Not me.

155
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:14,260
我怕的是活着
I fear life.

156
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:20,227
George 你有朋友吗
Do you have any friends, George?

157
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,198
我有点愤世嫉俗
I'm kind of a misanthrope.

158
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,973
这不由我决定
Not a choice, just a fact.

159
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,018
再见 帅哥 
Okay, handsome.

160
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:46,790
妈妈 注意形象
Mom! Jesus!

161
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:48,532
嗨 翘鼻子
Hi, banana!

162
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:54,933
进来吗
You wanna come up?

163
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:00,677
对于刚才的事很抱歉 我们度过了一个美好的夜晚
I'm sorry about that, chicken. We had a really late night.

164
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,805
你上学前我们刚到家
I think we got home right before you left for school.

165
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:09,446
妈妈 这是我新结识的朋友 George
Mom, this is my new friend, George.

166
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:10,919
- 你好 George  - 你好 Howe夫人
- Well, George. - Hello, Mrs. Howe.

167
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,650
- 见到你很高兴  - 很高兴
- What a genuine pleasure. - Very nice to...

168
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:13,850
Sally 高脚杯放哪了
Sally, do you know where our stemware went?

169
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,086
我想喝杯白兰地
I'm drinking wine out of a tumbler.

170
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:17,617
George 你喝什么
What do you want, George?

171
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:22,057
我们在乡下时就那么干
And this was before we left the sticks.

172
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,225
我使了一下颜色 向下看
So, I cock one eye, look down,

173
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:28,131
以为会看到一只田鳖
expecting to see a giant water bug,

174
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,935
或是水蛇 或是
or a water moccasin, or...

175
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:34,570
一些我巴不得杀了的水生动物
Water something. Something I had to kill.

176
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,875
但却是飞行员的手
But it was the pilot's hand!

177
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:37,949
别激动
Oh!

178
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,250
痒不痒 这里
Ticklish, this one!

179
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:44,488
拿条毛巾给你
Let me get you a paper towel.

180
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:48,791
你们知道吗 怕痒的人都是好情人
You know, ticklish people make great lovers.

181
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:51,855
身体的每一处都能唤起情欲
Everything is erogenous.

182
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,460
天哪 太神了
My God. She's amazing.

183
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:58,661
如果你是她女儿就不那么想了
Not if you're her daughter.

184
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:00,862
怎么来纽约了
How'd you end up in New York?

185
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:05,273
我母亲16岁的时候有了我 我父亲是一名卡车司机
My mom had me when she was 16. My dad was a truck driver,

186
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:07,641
有一天他离开了就再也没有回来过
and one day he took off and never came back.

187
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:09,213
那是在哪里
And this was?

188
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,908
克拉克斯堡 田纳西州的一个小镇
Clarksburg. It's a small town in Tennessee.

189
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:16,250
他是纽约的暴发户 有一家纺织厂
This rich guy from New York, who owned a textile plant,

190
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:18,409
他拯救了我们
started coming down, and it

191
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,987
就像是垂死之人抓到救命稻草
was like we were castaways and he was the ship.

192
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:24,753
但我是8岁时来这的
But I ended up here,

193
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:30,301
新学校 新朋友和漂亮的新衣服
eight years old, new school, new friends, fancy new clothes.

194
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:32,694
我妈妈一年前和他离婚了
My mom divorced him a year ago,

195
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:35,864
现在又恢复神经质的单身生活
and now she's back on the singles scene with a vengeance.

196
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:42,938
我该做作业去了
I do think I should get some homework done, though.

197
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,776
我也该回去了  有事要做
I should get going then. Got work to do myself.

198
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,753
不错
Yeah, right.

199
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:58,655
谢谢
Thank you.

200
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:00,958
再见
Goodbye.

201
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:33,396
这不是第一次发生了
It's not the first time it's happened.

202
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:34,863
我知道
I know.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,468
你也从来不认为他们会发生这样的事
But you never think it's gonna be the people that it's gonna be.

204
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:39,228
他们都在一起15年了
They've been together for 15 years.

205
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:40,936
这当然很荒谬
I know. It's certainly ridiculous.

206
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,405
- 怎么没电了  - 嗨 亲爱的
- What happened to the electricity? - Hi, sweetie.

207
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:46,136
我们叫了烤鸡店的外卖
We got take-out from the rotisserie chicken place.

208
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:47,506
拿碟子来和我们一起吃吧
Grab a plate and join us.

209
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,603
为什么没电了 发生了什么
But the lights. What happened?

210
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:53,081
我的错 忘了付电费
It's my fault. I forgot to pay the bill.

211
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:55,085
没事 明天就有电了
And it's no big deal. They'll be on tomorrow.

212
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:58,916
George 我们可以将这
George, we're trying to turn

213
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,924
有点尴尬混乱的场面当作一次有趣的经历
this awkward little mix-up into a fun experience.

214
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,722
如果你不想加入我们的话
And if you can't get into the spirit of adventure,

215
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,638
可以做你自己的事
then you can just do your own thing.

216
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,196
也不必呆在这了
You don't have to stick around.

217
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:09,096
还真抱歉 Jack 我不能用手提电脑了
I'm sorry, Jack. I can't use my laptop,

218
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:11,101
更不用说写作业了
much less get my assignments.

219
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:14,798
可以去图书馆或者星巴克啊 要善于应变
So, go to the library or Starbucks. Be resourceful.

220
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:30,954
有人知道小说中的
Does anyone have any ideas about

221
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:32,630
哪些部分
which elements of the novel

222
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:35,254
具有文学浪漫主义运动的特征吗
pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?

223
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,663
有人知道吗
Anyone?

224
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:41,289
George?

225
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:45,135
George?

226
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:46,860
是
Yeah?

227
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:49,551
我的问题是在我们做的作业中
I was asking what conclusion

228
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,807
你得出了什么结论
you came to in the exercise we're doing.

229
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:54,477
抱歉 能再说一遍吗
Sorry. About what, again?

230
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:56,413
小说中的那些部分
About which elements of the novel

231
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:58,881
具有文学浪漫主义运动的特征
pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?

232
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,380
哪部小说
Which novel?

233
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,564
《卡斯特桥市长》
The Mayor of Casterbridge,

234
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:12,157
George 很显然 你没读过
George, which, obviously, you didn't read.

235
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:13,492
我很喜欢这小说
I loved it.

236
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:15,998
看得出  还有人知道吗
Clearly. Anyone else?

237
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,360
这部小说中我最喜欢的
My favorite part of the

238
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,235
是室内商业区的布局
book is how the town's layout is described

239
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:20,826
以纵览整座城镇的
from the perspective of a bee

240
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:23,137
蜜蜂的视角来描述
traveling from one side of town to the other.

241
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:25,574
这样的描述很形象
It's so visual.

242
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:29,812
我认为Hardy采用自然界中
So, I guess what Hardy's doing is aligning his point of view

243
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:32,179
最小 最纤弱的昆虫的视角来描述
not with an all-seeing God but with an insect,

244
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:34,275
而不是全能全知的视角进行描述
the tiniest, humblest creature in nature.

245
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:37,949
这样的手法很有浪漫主义运动的特征
Which is pretty Romantic.

246
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:43,051
George 我想你找到学期论文的主题了
I think you just found your term paper, George.

247
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:55,699
George!

248
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:56,774
Hi.

249
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:01,908
- 和我们一起吧  - 好
- Come join us. - Cool.

250
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:06,206
你认识Will和Zoe吧
You know Will and Zoe, right?

251
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,512
我们一起上数学课
Yeah, we're in math class together, right?

252
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:11,418
你从没写过作业
You never have your homework.

253
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:13,423
对 这是我的特色
Right. Right, it's my shtick.

254
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,961
- 你好 George - 你好 Zoe
- Hi, George. - Hey, Zoe.

255
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:18,495
哥们 你总是在画些什么
Dude, what are you always drawing?

256
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:21,430
他就像是发狂的艺术家 整天弯腰驼背在书上画些什么
He's like the mad artist, just hunched over his books.

257
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,125
从不听老师讲课
He never listens to a word the teacher says.

258
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:26,033
- 你不也一样吗  - 我能看看你画的那堆狗屎吗
- What, like you do? - Can I see some of the shit you draw?

259
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:29,206
当然
Yeah, sure.

260
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:39,515
一整本呢
You have issues.

261
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:42,578
哥们 你感情很细腻
No. Dude, you're sensitive.

262
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,154
多愁善感的画师
The sensitive artiste.

263
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,524
能给我的派对画一幅这样的画吗
Could you draw something like this for one of my parties?

264
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,185
在我弟弟除夕夜派对上贴上一幅巨大的画
I'm throwing a huge one at my brother's club on New Year's Eve.

265
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:50,818
- 说真的  - 当然
- You serious? - Yeah.

266
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:53,659
可以把它放大 做海报 邀请贴之类的
You know, we can blow it up, make it a poster, invites, flyers.

267
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,099
很不错 不是吗
Yeah, that'd be great, right?

268
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:19,613
- 嘿 George 你好吗  - 我很好
- Hey, George. How are you? - Fine.

269
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:21,490
干什么呢
Well, what are you doing?

270
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:23,484
写三角函数作业
Just finishing my trig assignment.

271
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,854
好孩子 这是我喜欢听到的
Good man. That's what I like to hear.

272
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,718
我收到了72人的回复
I've got 72 comps on my list alone.

273
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,784
- 大多是你的朋友  - 嗯
- Most of them are your friends. - Yeah.

274
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,991
他们会是派对上最酷的
And they're gonna be the coolest people there.

275
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,457
- 没错  - 别怀疑
- Yeah, you're right. - So don't question it.

276
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,927
而且 如果我叫上我的人 你的整体运作都将瘫痪
Besides, if I pull my people, your whole operation goes under.

277
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:01,556
- Will  - George小弟
- Will. - Brother George!

278
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,333
伙计 我太喜欢了
I love it, man.

279
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,006
正合适派对 
Nice celebratory mood. Perfect for a party.

280
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,537
下一步呢 巴斯奎特（著名艺术家）
So, what now, Basquiat?

281
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:20,707
守则第一条是翘课
Rule number one about cutting school.

282
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,286
我以前逃过课
I've cut school before.

283
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:23,820
去商店购物
To shop.

284
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:27,423
- 守则第一条 旷课很有趣  - 这什么守则
- Rule number one, cutting school is fun. - That's a rule?

285
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,220
守则第二条  少旷课以保持新鲜感
Rule number two, cut rarely to preserve the specialness.

286
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:33,024
这是话么
Is that even a word?

287
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:34,655
守则第三条
Rule number three,

288
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:35,886
买些书增加人文方面的修养
do something culturally

289
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:38,031
能促进道德的提升
rewarding with your time to earn it morally.

290
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:39,694
守则第四条 你是个呆子
Rule number four, you're a dork.

291
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:43,203
错 第四条是面条(双关:笨蛋)
Wrong. Rule number four, noodles.

292
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,906
面条
Noodles?

293
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:53,954
告诉我 你为什么不结婚

294
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:56,154
我还没邂逅我的梦中女孩

295
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:01,854
你喜欢我么

296
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:02,854
当然不

297
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:06,193
你就是那么看我们的
Is that how you see us?

298
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:08,796
你是个老人而我是你12岁的侄女
You're the old man and I'm your 12-year-old niece?

299
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,458
不是
No.

300
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:11,875
你带每个认识的女孩
So, what, you take all the

301
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:14,129
去看这部电影 这就是你秘密武器
girls to this movie? Is it your secret weapon?

302
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:16,398
玩什么不是玩
When you're cutting school, you go to whatever's playing.

303
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:17,942
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

304
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:19,968
- 等一下  - 干嘛
- Whoa. - What?

305
00:19:20,278 --> 00:19:23,247
- 那是我继父  - 所以呢
- That's my stepfather. - So?

306
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:26,146
首先 他办公室在镇上的另一头
Well, A, his office is on the other side of town.

307
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:29,277
其次 他看上去很怪
And B, he looks weird.

308
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:33,415
我们跟踪他吧
Let's follow him.

309
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:37,518
你认为他在做什么
What do you think he's doing?

310
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,352
也许只是赶去开会
Probably just going to a meeting.

311
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,327
我打赌是和情人幽会
I bet it's a lovers' rendezvous.

312
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:43,366
我继父就一直那么干
My stepfather cheated all the time.

313
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:45,625
也许吧
Maybe.

314
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:50,740
无意冒犯 但是他看起来很吓人
No offense, but he looks kind of creepy.

315
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:02,712
开会才不会来这
Strange place for a meeting.

316
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:07,252
看来也不是什么
Lovers' rendezvous amended to

317
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:09,860
幽会地点了
drug buy from skanky hooker.

318
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:21,366
嘿 Bill
Hey, Bill.

319
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:24,067
你就像冷战时的间谍一样 来去无踪
You are like a Cold War spy. You move only in shadow.

320
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:26,234
我 我一直在附近啊
Me? I'm always around.

321
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,844
我看你交了些新朋友
I see you made some new friends.

322
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:32,211
不完全是
Not necessarily. Jury's still out.

323
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:34,251
我为你高兴 George 只是
I'm happy for you, George. I just...

324
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:36,377
我希望你小心点
I just want you to be careful.

325
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:38,517
- 他们怎么了  - 没啥
- What's wrong with them? - Nothing.

326
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:42,453
但是他们通过考试都比你容易
But they have an easier time of getting by than you do.

327
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,824
你跟不上这个学习团体的步伐
You're not exactly hooking up with a study group.

328
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:47,844
告诉你点消息
Hey, I have something for you.

329
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:50,160
几周后该开"职业介绍日"了
Career Day is coming up in a few weeks,

330
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:53,702
我们总是会让一名模范学生
and we always assign an exemplary student

331
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:56,000
代替摩根学校向同学发言
to represent Morgan to the alumni speakers.

332
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:57,188
就像联络员一样
You know, to act as a liaison,

333
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,667
陪同他们到教室 诸如此类
escort them to the classroom, whatever...

334
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,277
你真的是疯了
You have really lost it.

335
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:03,176
Dougherty夫人给我说了你那事儿
Then there is that matter that Mrs. Dougherty broached to me.

336
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:04,578
- 候选者  - 对
- The substitute? - Yeah.

337
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:08,140
在学校是抽烟是要开除学籍的
Smoking on campus is automatic suspension.

338
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:11,019
这是我最不想干的事
This is the last thing I wanna do.

339
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:14,855
没问题 开除学籍 就这样了
No problem. Suspension it is. Done. Effective...

340
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:15,983
好的 我去
Fine. Fine.

341
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:19,995
- 我会去的  - 很好 很好
- I'll do it. - Great. Great.

342
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:21,122
我们会把计划书
We'll be sending out an e-mail

343
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:22,658
和你的工作任务发邮件给你
with your schedule and your responsibilities.

344
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:26,954
人才招聘会

345
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:48,016
你是Dustin吗
Are you Dustin?

346
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,159
对
Yeah.

347
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:53,953
我是George 我是你的联络员
Hi. I'm George. I'm your liaison.

348
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,860
你好
Hey.

349
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,567
我是Dustin Heath
My name is Dustin Heath.

350
00:21:57,735 --> 00:22:00,761
我曾经是这里的学生
I'm a student. I was a student here.

351
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,971
我和那个可怕的老头儿在一个班
I was in the class with that terrifying old man over there.

352
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:05,907
我是艺术家
Yeah, I'm an artist.

353
00:22:06,277 --> 00:22:07,801
说实话 我也不知道我在这里做什么
Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing here.

354
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:11,404
他们打电话邀请我来那会儿我宿醉还没醒呢
Was a little hungover when they called me and asked me to do this

355
00:22:11,516 --> 00:22:13,575
我想快点挂电话然后就同意了
and I said yes just to get them off the phone.

356
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:15,983
几天后我就收到了计划书
I got the schedule in the mail several days later

357
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:17,645
然后我就有点尴尬
and I was a little embarrassed.

358
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:21,350
我没有什么成就
I'm not really established or anything.

359
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:26,854
一年前我第一次办艺术展 挺不错
I had my first art show a year ago, which was good.

360
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,228
买了这件外套
Got me this coat.

361
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:36,371
我给你们看一些我的作品吧
Well, let me show you some of my work here.

362
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:40,067
我不知道 有时人们认为你的作品
I don't know, sometimes people look at your stuff

363
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:42,339
他们认为很有趣
and, you know, they think it's really interesting

364
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:43,812
或者就是一坨狗屎
or they think it's bullshit,

365
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:47,009
我不知道两者的区别 确实不知
and I don't know the difference. I honestly don't.

366
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:53,185
我想 只要不欺骗自己就行 了
You just, you know, hope not to be fooling yourself, I guess.

367
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:56,091
这是下一张
This is the next slide, here.

368
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,194
你们有问题吗
Anybody have any questions?

369
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:03,900
没人问我问题 我刚是不是太差劲了
I mean, nobody asked me any questions. Did I just suck?

370
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:06,024
你是今天发言者中
You were probably the only real,

371
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:07,962
最真材实料 毫不浮夸的人
non-full-of-shit person speaking today.

372
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:10,006
就像原子弹轰过似的
It felt like Nagasaki in there.

373
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:11,575
你很棒
You were great.

374
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,777
谢谢 哥们
Thanks, man.

375
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:19,875
你也画画吗
Do you paint?

376
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:22,778
对 我喜欢画画
Yeah, I'd like to.

377
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:24,514
只是不知道画什么
I just don't know what to paint.

378
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:26,984
知道吗 这才是最艰难的 
Yeah, well, it's the hardest part, you know?

379
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:29,256
这会让我成不了画家吗
Does that make me not a painter?

380
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:31,354
你所追求的事实才是作画的真谛
The fact that you struggle with it is a really good thing.

381
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,494
但你不作画又怎能自称画家
But how can you call yourself a painter if you don't paint?

382
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,968
- 你喜欢摩根学校么  - 不是很喜欢
- You like Morgan? - Not really.

383
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:45,738
我不知道在这干什么
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

384
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:49,812
我想没有人知道 George
I don't think anybody does, George.

385
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:51,877
至少你敢于承认
At least you admit it.

386
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:55,266
如果愿意 你可以来我
If you want, you can come to

387
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,147
布鲁克林的工作室 看一些作品
my studio in Brooklyn and check some stuff out.

388
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:05,719
你准备假期一直闲逛吗
You sticking around for the holidays?

389
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,831
不 去圣巴特岛 玩家庭游艇
Nah. St. Bart's. Family yacht.

390
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:09,933
这样
Oh.

391
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:12,529
开玩笑啦 没计划
Kidding. No plans.

392
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:14,370
你真杯具
You're a loser.

393
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,108
我也是 咱俩应该出去玩玩
Well, me, too. We should hang out.

394
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:20,542
也许吧
Maybe.

395
00:24:23,948 --> 00:24:25,381
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

396
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:16,362
- 你好 - 你好
- Hi. - Hey.

397
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,059
我们能进去吗
Should we come in?

398
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:20,002
请进
Please.

399
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:22,004
你好
Hi.

400
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:32,382
太棒了 这些作品画了多长时间
These are amazing. How long did they take?

401
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:34,246
它们风格迥异 
They're all kind of different, you know?

402
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:35,613
每一幅作品都经历了
Each one goes through its

403
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:37,420
自身的死亡与重生
own little process of death and rebirth.

404
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:41,782
那一幅用了两小时
That one literally took me two hours.

405
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,588
他们都是实实在在的
They're all their own little entities, really.

406
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,564
- 你住这里吗  - 嗯
- You live here, too? - Mm-hmm.

407
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,234
太简陋了
It's so simple.

408
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:55,564
这无关舒适 你懂吗
It's not about comfort, really, you know?

409
00:25:57,775 --> 00:26:00,005
你多大了
You... How old are you?

410
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:02,510
十八岁
18.

411
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:04,412
不会吧
No.

412
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:09,753
每次我有了灵感
Every time I think about a subject,

413
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:13,880
甚至去构想一幅自认为应该画的东西
or even try to visualize an image of what I think I should paint,

414
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,516
我觉得自己就像一坨狗屎
I just feel like I'm full of shit,

415
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:18,857
像我根本不是我自己一样
like I'm trying to be something I'm not.

416
00:26:18,963 --> 00:26:20,590
George 这就是你的本性
George, this is who you are.

417
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:23,258
这些作品太棒了 真的很棒 很了不起
This stuff is wonderful, man. It really is. It's fantastic.

418

419
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:29,299
不 哥们 这就是你要作的东西
No, man. This is what you should be painting.

420
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:30,400
至少你要加入别的东西
At least until you evolve

421
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:32,069
才能使其完整 知道我的意思吧
into something else, you know what I mean?

422
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,644
但是你得一直练习
But you gotta exercise the muscle

423

即使你没有什么感觉 知道我的意思吧
even if you're not feeling it, you know what I mean?

424
00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:40,442
你只要 你得实实在在的做 否则它永远不会出现
You just... You gotta do it or else it'll never happen.

我不会打她注意的
I'll leave that alone.

I mean, he's amazing. Really talented. Don't you think?

438
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,229
都是些跟风之作 我不确定他是否货真价实
A little derivative. I'm not sure he's the real deal.

439
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:34,469
是吗 我觉得他就是
Really? He seemed like it to me.

我是说 他是你的导师
I mean, he's a mentor to you now.

441
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:39,743
- 你不兴奋吗  - 我认为他有点爱吹牛
- Aren't you psyched? - I think he's a bit of a blowhard.

442
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:41,311
你太怪了
You're so weird.

443

他提到我没有
Did he say anything about me?

没有
Nope.

我没有 我要是喜欢就告诉你了

No, I'm sorry. I lost you.

519
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,684

Broke my promise.

520
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:49,196

Careful.

527

这是终极解药
This is the cure to end all cures.

528
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:12,574
我爸经常放个生鸡蛋更有效果
My daddy used to put a raw egg in his to really get the effects.

529
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:14,541
- 你要加蛋吗  - 不用了
- You want an egg? - No.

530
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:17,412
这是醒酒液
You've heard of a hair of the dog?

531
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:24,283
上面是牛肉汤

妈妈 你在做什么
Mom, what are you doing?

535
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:34,025
你得滋补一下嘛 坏脾气小姐
But you have to have a coalminer's tonic, Miss Grumpy.

536
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:35,860
就像疫苗一样
It's like a vaccine.

537
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,859
我不管了 我回房间
I can't deal. I'm going back to bed.

538
00:38:42,806 --> 00:38:45,741
她起床比斗牛犬还凶
Angrier than a pit bull when she wakes up.

539
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:38,154
驱逐令

540
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:46,629
我喜欢这个孩子
I like that boy.

541
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:48,068
我也是
So do I.

542
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:52,004
Sal 我认为你不能在他身上浪费时间了
Sal, I don't think you should be messing around with him.

543
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:55,702
你是在给我约会建议吗
Are you giving me dating advice?

544
00:39:57,214 --> 00:40:00,377
我只是认为你应该和适合自己的对象约会
I just think you should be going out with someone your own speed.

545
00:40:00,617 --> 00:40:02,141
别担心 我们只是朋友
Don't worry, we're just friends.

546
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:03,751
这才是我担心的
That's exactly what worries me.

547
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:06,856
Charlotte 我不评论你的社交生活
Charlotte, I don't comment on your social life.

548
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:09,322
你也无权评论我的
You hardly have the right to comment on mine.

549
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:12,054
- 我看到了他看你的眼神  - 天呐
- I've seen the way he looks at you. - Jesus.

550
00:40:12,262 --> 00:40:13,923
他对此的感觉没那么简单
This all means something much more to him.

551
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:18,699
相信我 我一辈子都在游戏感情
Trust me, I've played with their affections my whole life.

552
00:40:20,637 --> 00:40:23,299
但面对真感情 就不能玩了
But with the good ones, it's not right.

553
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:28,077
那是你的做法 我和你不一样
That's what you do. It's not what I'm doing.

554
00:40:38,622 --> 00:40:39,987
这个创意不错 
This is a great idea, by the way.

555
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:42,290
几个月后我有一个画展
I got a show coming up in a couple of months.

556
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:44,417
我需要一些灵感 知道吧
I needed some inspiration, you know?

557
00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:46,586
一流的作品
Big time.

558
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,759
你喜欢这个吗
Do you like this?

559
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:51,231
我理解它 你呢
I get it. Do you?

560
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:53,370
我认为任何人都可以
I think anyone could turn this out,

561
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:55,030
但是为何想要理解它
except why would they want to?

562
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:56,537
它说明了什么
What's it saying?

563
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,164
使空间看起来更大 知道吗
Makes a room look great, though, you know?

564
00:40:58,975 --> 00:41:00,408
看上去像钱
It looks like money.

565
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:08,982
上帝
Oh, God.

566
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:11,614
这对我来说就像天堂
This is heaven to me.

567
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,523
确实很棒
Pretty great.

568
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:18,018
它让你立马感受到某些东西 你知道我的意思吧
This makes you feel something instantly, you know what I mean?

569
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:21,391
比如生气
Like anger

570
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:23,397
或者愤怒
or wrath.

571
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,399
性欲
Lust.

572
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:35,975
你和Sally怎么样了 有进展不
So, how's it going with our friend Sally? Make any moves?

573
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,481
她对我不感兴趣
She hasn't shown any interest.

574
00:41:39,683 --> 00:41:40,945
那你呢
Well, have you?

575
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:43,123
你是怎么想的
What do you think, she's

576
00:41:43,124 --> 00:41:45,352
她会满世界的说爱你吗
gonna go around wearing a sign around her neck?

577
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:46,786
女人喜欢被追求
Women love being desired.

578
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,553
你只需把她推到墙上 然后吻她
You just go throw her up against the wall, start kissing her.

579
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,753
她回吻说明有戏
Chances are she'll kiss you back.

580
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:55,423
如果没有 至少你尝试过
And if she doesn't, then at least you tried.

581
00:41:58,201 --> 00:42:01,796
你得跨出一步 否则你会失去她
You gotta do something or you might lose her.

582
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:18,781
你喜欢这个
You love this.

583
00:42:21,024 --> 00:42:22,423
这个不错
No, it's good.

584
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:28,258
迷恋客观事物 挺适合你的
Fetishizing an object. That suits you.

585
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:44,254
情人节餐单

586
00:42:42,746 --> 00:42:46,341
难以置信我们也会随大流
I can't believe we're participating in this consumer circle jerk.

587
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:48,576
单身者今晚需要紧紧相随
The dateless need to stick together tonight.

588
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:50,949
像幸存者一样相拥取暖
We're like survivors huddling for warmth.

589
00:42:51,588 --> 00:42:53,954
你一定过了好几次情人节
You've probably had so many Valentines.

590
00:42:54,724 --> 00:42:57,522
这是委婉的说我水性杨花吗
Is that some kind of euphemism for slut?

591
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:03,231
印象最深的是和我爸爸
The one I remember most was my dad.

592
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,091
在哪
Where was that?

593
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:07,897
离开田纳西州之前
It was before we left Tennessee.

594
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,234
我6岁 他已经走了
I was six and he had already left,

595
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:12,464
但是他经常回来
but he'd come back every so often.

596
00:43:12,776 --> 00:43:16,075
他骑着摩托载着我呼啸而过 
He roared up on his motorcycle, took me out alone.

597
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:19,671
晚饭时用薄饼蘸着巧克力糖浆
We had pancakes with chocolate syrup at a diner, at night.

598
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:22,750
他都让我点餐
He let me order.

599
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:27,154
你爸爸在哪
Where's your father?

600
00:43:28,124 --> 00:43:32,857
在北京 他几年前为了挣钱去的
Beijing. He moved there years ago for the economic boom.

601
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,829
你们联系过吗
You guys have a relationship?

602
00:43:35,432 --> 00:43:38,333
他填支票 支付我的学费
He checks in, pays my tuition.

603
00:43:38,568 --> 00:43:40,782
但是我们之间差别太大
But we couldn't be more different.

604
00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:43,062
我认为他有点失望
I think he's a little disappointed.

605
00:43:46,943 --> 00:43:50,344
我7岁时和他在东京待过一段时间
I spent some time in Tokyo with him when I was seven.

606
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,947
他在那里经营公司 每天工作12 14小时
He was running a company there, working 12, 14 hours a day.

607
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:55,707
所以我有了一个
So, I had this full-time

608
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,815
不会说英语的全职保姆
Japanese babysitter who didn't speak English.

609
00:43:57,921 --> 00:43:59,149
我们根本不能理解对方
We couldn't understand each other at all.

610
00:44:00,457 --> 00:44:02,049
很快 她厌倦了照顾我
Pretty soon, she ran out of things to do with me

611
00:44:02,158 --> 00:44:05,127
而她也不许我离开酒店
and I ended up never leaving the hotel room.

612
00:44:06,263 --> 00:44:07,389
我就像一头小牛
I was like a veal.

613
00:44:12,168 --> 00:44:13,726
你小时候什么样
What were you like as a child?

614
00:44:14,704 --> 00:44:16,433
比我现在好多了
I was such a better person than I am now.

615
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,433
- 得了吧  - 没开玩笑
- Come on. - I'm serious.

616
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:24,013
我快乐 开放 好奇 
I was happy, I was open, I was curious.

617
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:28,144
但我告诉你 我知道何时会结束
But I'll tell you this, I knew when it was ending.

618
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:29,313
当我意识到我要改变
I was overwhelmed with

619
00:44:29,314 --> 00:44:31,584
意识到这比看上去还糟糕
sadness when I realized that I was gonna change

620
00:44:31,688 --> 00:44:34,851
被悲伤击垮的时候就会结束了
and that it was all most likely gonna get worse.

621
00:44:37,694 --> 00:44:40,561
比如现在的思乡之情 我无法摆脱它
Like a nostalgia for the present, I couldn't shake it.

622
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,333
什么
What?

623
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:47,635
我很奇怪 对吧
I'm weird, right?

624
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:50,605
不
No.

625
00:44:51,374 --> 00:44:52,773
你不奇怪
No, you're not.

626
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:04,644
奇怪的是我这么久
It's weird not having a boyfriend.

627
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,346
都没有男朋友
It's been so long.

628
00:45:06,823 --> 00:45:07,992
因为你都高三了
That's because it's the

629
00:45:07,993 --> 00:45:10,281
都是些比你小的师弟
first year at school nobody's older than you.

630
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:11,894
资源稀缺啊
Your pool dried up.

631
00:45:13,096 --> 00:45:16,122
- 你怎么知道 －我是一个细心的人
- How do you know that? - I'm a very insightful person.

632
00:45:20,737 --> 00:45:22,864
你做过么
Have you ever had sex?

633
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,135
当然 很多
Yeah, tons.

634
00:45:26,743 --> 00:45:28,074
说真的 有过吗
No, really. Have you?

635
00:45:30,513 --> 00:45:32,071
你为什么这么问
Why are you asking me this?

636
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:36,246
你知道我没有过
You know I haven't.

637
00:45:36,353 --> 00:45:39,982
哦 我不知道 我只是有点好奇
Well, I don't know, I'm just wondering.

638
00:45:44,094 --> 00:45:45,959
你是否想过和我
Have you ever thought about me?

639
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:48,155
什么意思
What do you mean?

640
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:53,493
你知道我在说什么 你有没有想过和我
You know what I mean. Have you ever thought about it?

641
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:57,000
你说这些干嘛
Why are you doing this?

642
00:46:02,045 --> 00:46:04,275
你会和我上床么
Will you have sex with me?

643
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:14,247
开个玩笑啦
I'm just kidding.

644
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:15,756
糟糕的主意
Bad idea.

645
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,659
那样也太怪了
I mean, can you imagine how weird that would be?

646
00:46:26,803 --> 00:46:28,600
你是我唯一的知心朋友
You're my only real friend.

647
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:30,772
不能毁了这段友情
Let's not ruin it.

648
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:44,510
我们是不是该找Will和Zoe一起开房
Should we check in with Will and Zoe?

649
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:50,325
George?

650
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,995
George?

651
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,722
我得走了
I have to go.

652
00:46:58,034 --> 00:46:59,695
什么
What?

653
00:46:59,803 --> 00:47:01,600
我不舒服
I'm not feeling well.

654
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:04,205
好吧 那我们明天见
Okay. Well, will I see you tomorrow?

655
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:06,274
不清楚
I don't know.

656
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:12,176
这个是不对的 它只是玩笑
This is wrong. It's a joke.

657
00:47:15,552 --> 00:47:17,645
George 你想多了
You think too much, George!

658
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:27,893
? Trav'ling lady, stay awhile ?

659
00:47:33,903 --> 00:47:38,772
? I'm just a station on your way ?

660
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:45,908
? I know I'm not your lover ?

661
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:02,124
? Trav'ling lady, stay awhile ?

662
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:09,299
出去
Get out.

663
00:48:09,572 --> 00:48:12,473
George 你怎么回事 为什么你不在学校
George? What is going on? Why aren't you at school?

664
00:48:12,942 --> 00:48:14,116
我在家当然就
If you speak even the most

665
00:48:14,117 --> 00:48:15,968
不在学校了 
rudimentary form of the English language,

666
00:48:16,112 --> 00:48:17,101
这么简单的逻辑都不懂
then you'll understand this,

667
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:19,839
让我自己待会
leave me alone.

668
00:48:20,683 --> 00:48:22,082
你刚才和我说什么
What did you just say to me?

669
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,980
Vivian 我说得很清楚
Vivian, my voice is calm.

670
00:48:25,088 --> 00:48:26,487
我现在是一个游离的思考个体
I'm a free-thinking individual

671
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:28,887
不参与你的话题
who chooses not to be engaged in this discussion.

672
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:33,193
请离开
Please.

673
00:48:52,815 --> 00:48:57,684
? Trav'ling lady, stay awhile ?

674
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,586
? Until the night is over ?

675
00:49:08,965 --> 00:49:10,330
George 你在做什么
George, what are you doing?

676
00:49:11,568 --> 00:49:13,900
Jack 对不起 我现在需要自己呆会
I'm sorry, Jack. I need to be left alone right now.

677
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:15,436
你的功课怎么样
What about your work?

678
00:49:15,672 --> 00:49:17,196
我现在不想做
I just can't do it right now.

679
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:20,368
我现在正痛苦呢
I'm going through something.

680
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:22,943
真可悲
That's pathetic.

681
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:26,248
但至少是事实
At least it's the truth.

682
00:49:26,683 --> 00:49:28,446
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

683
00:49:57,413 --> 00:50:01,509
And why are you so quiet now ?

684
00:50:02,852 --> 00:50:06,652
? standing there in the doorway? ?

685
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:11,985
? You chose your journey long before ?

686
00:50:12,962 --> 00:50:16,693
? You came upon this highway ?

687
00:50:23,206 --> 00:50:28,269
? Trav'ling lady, stay awhile ?

688
00:50:28,444 --> 00:50:31,880
? Until the night is over ?

689
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:40,784
- 你好 － 你好
- Hey. - Hey.

690
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,188
- 你怎么样 － 很好
- How are you? - Good.

691
00:50:44,027 --> 00:50:45,460
不错
That's good.

692
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:49,091
一切  一切都好么
Everything... Everything all right?

693
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:51,223
没错 挺好  一切都好
Yeah. Yeah, everything's all right.

694
00:50:54,537 --> 00:50:56,937
George 怎么样 他没有回我的电话
How's George? He hasn't returned my calls.

695
00:50:57,674 --> 00:51:00,871
对 这正是我要和你讨论的
Yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.

696
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:03,571
他也不和我说话
He's not exactly speaking to me either.

697
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,148
- 为什么 发生了什么 - 我也不知道
- Why? What happened? - I don't know.

698
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,241
你知道George
You know George.

699
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:11,813
我想 他是比较难懂的
He's complicated, I guess.

700
00:51:15,892 --> 00:51:17,291
嗯
Yeah.

701
00:51:18,895 --> 00:51:19,884
我好奇
I was wondering,

702
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:23,488
对你而言 我不止是George的朋友吧
I'm not just George's friend to you, am I?

703
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:35,707
Sally 你和George应该在一起
You and George should be together, Sally.

704
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:37,736
我们只是朋友
We're just friends.

705
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,782
不可能
There's no such thing.

706
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:44,752
我喜欢这首曲子
I love this song.

707
00:51:52,228 --> 00:51:53,786
跳舞吧
You wanna dance?

708
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:56,855
来吧
Come on.

709
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:08,070
怎么
What?

710
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:09,936
我们不应该这样
We shouldn't be doing this.

711
00:52:10,246 --> 00:52:13,215
- 我们只是跳舞 - 是么
- We're just dancing. - Oh, yeah?

712
00:52:34,837 --> 00:52:36,202
George.

713
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,200
我一直等你的论文呢
Been looking forward to

714
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,501
今天最后一天了
reading your Hardy paper. Today's the day.

715
00:52:43,179 --> 00:52:45,170
对不起 我还没有做
Sorry, I don't have it.

716
00:52:45,481 --> 00:52:47,642
George 这是你的毕业论文
George, this was your final project of the year.

717
00:52:47,784 --> 00:52:51,550
交论文 然后年终考试 我多么希望你能毕业
After this, there's just exams. How am I supposed to grade you?

718
00:52:53,189 --> 00:52:56,317
我保证 我下周交
I'll have it to you by next week, I promise.

719
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:00,390
那似乎不行
That's not gonna be good enough.

720
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,259
Pal 你好
Hey, pal.

721
00:53:15,244 --> 00:53:19,305
我召集这个会议是因为你的老师们反映
I called this meeting because your teachers have reported to me

722
00:53:19,415 --> 00:53:21,212
你还是不做作业
that you continue to refuse to do the course work.

723
00:53:21,317 --> 00:53:22,683
你一点都不努力
You have made zero effort

724
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:24,980
在摩根学校这里虚度光阴
to turn your career here at Morgan around.

725
00:53:25,254 --> 00:53:26,721
是 没错
Yes, I did.

726
00:53:26,856 --> 00:53:28,214
我是说 最初我也努力过
I mean, I did struggle

727
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:31,054
但是我没有做到
with it at the beginning, but I just couldn't.

728
00:53:31,148 --> 00:53:33,582
好 你没有时间了
Well, you are out of time.

729
00:53:34,251 --> 00:53:36,685
决定你未来的时刻已经到了
The moment to decide your future has arrived.

730
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:42,885
现在 根据这些老师们的建议
Now, against the recommendation of some in this room,

731
00:53:43,093 --> 00:53:44,856
我让你自己选择
I'm giving you a choice.

732
00:53:45,729 --> 00:53:47,356
第一开除
First is expulsion.

733
00:53:47,864 --> 00:53:49,627
如果这是你想要的
It's yours if you want it.

734
00:53:49,866 --> 00:53:51,231
第二选择
Second option,

735
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:53,279
如果你想毕业
if you want to graduate,

736
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,435
你补齐所有你落下的作业
you make up every single assignment you missed.

737
00:53:56,573 --> 00:53:58,234
所有的论文 练习
Every paper, every exercise.

738
00:53:58,341 --> 00:54:01,572
也就是说相当一年的作业
Essentially, a year's worth of homework.

739
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,581
漏了一个 就没有毕业证书
If even one is missing on graduation day, no diploma.

740
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,087
你还有3周多一点的时间
You have a little over three weeks.

741
00:54:12,522 --> 00:54:13,927
George 我过去坚信
George, I used to believe

742
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:16,458
你比其他人有潜力
you had more potential than anyone else here.

743
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,494
但你从没证明给我看 哪怕一次也没
But you never delivered, not once.

744
00:54:19,296 --> 00:54:20,786
我以前从来都不浪费时间对你发火
I wasn't gonna waste the time getting mad at you.

745
00:54:20,964 --> 00:54:22,989
现在我也不想浪费时间维护你
I'm not gonna waste the time defending you now.

746
00:54:29,439 --> 00:54:32,203
暂不提你对老师的不尊重 George
Forget the lack of respect you show, George.

747
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:38,070
这就是度过我们的人生的方式
This is the way we make our living, how we spend our lives.

748
00:54:38,415 --> 00:54:41,282
但是你从来不关心这里发生的一切
But you simply don't care what goes on around here.

749
00:54:41,518 --> 00:54:44,078
为什么我们还要以德报怨
Why would we continue to reward that?

750
00:54:46,323 --> 00:54:47,722
你是对的
You're right.

751
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:50,223
我不该这样对你们
You shouldn't reward it.

752
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,728
我真的不知道该说什么
I honestly don't know what to say.

753
00:54:57,267 --> 00:54:59,098
也许应该退学
Maybe it should be expulsion.

754
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,004
你还是下周一告诉我们
Let us know on Monday.

755
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:06,238
好 行
All right. All right.

756
00:55:08,144 --> 00:55:09,133
谢谢
Thank you.

757
00:55:16,453 --> 00:55:19,650
你们告知我的父母没
Did you tell my parents about this?

758
00:55:20,023 --> 00:55:22,184
是 George 必须的
Yes, George, I had to.

759
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:35,738
嘿
Hey.

760
00:55:36,873 --> 00:55:38,272
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

761
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:42,169
是我的错  我一直忙着
Is it my fault? I mean, I've had a lot on my mind and...

762
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:43,644
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

763
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:47,750
我认为我做不到
I don't think I can do it.

764
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:50,786
哦 什么意思 不是还有另外一种选择
Well, what do you mean? What other choice is there?

765
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:52,286
妈妈 我不确信我能做到
Mom, I'm not sure that I can.

766
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:53,822
你不得不去做
You're just gonna have to do it.

767
00:55:53,923 --> 00:55:56,414
你应该坐下然后去完成
You're just gonna have to sit down and just do it!

768
00:55:56,526 --> 00:55:57,993
妈妈 我尝试坦诚的和你说
Mom, I'm trying to speak to you honestly.

769
00:55:58,128 --> 00:56:00,995
我不在乎 我已经受够了你的谎言
I don't care! I'm done listening to your lies!

770
00:56:01,131 --> 00:56:02,462
拜托 这事不可能办得到的
Come on, that's really the way to fix this!

771
00:56:02,565 --> 00:56:05,966
George 这是你的问题 你闯的祸
Hey, George! This is your mess, and it's a disaster.

772
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:07,769
Jack 你说的对 是我的事
You're right, Jack. It is my mess.

773
00:56:08,405 --> 00:56:10,032
我解决我的问题 你处理好你自己的
I'll handle my mess, you handle yours.

774
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,267
- 行 注意你的口气  - 等等 Viv 
- Okay, watch that tone. - Wait, Viv.

775
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,038
什么意思
What does that mean?

776
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:17,647
我是说 你想告诉我们
I mean, you wanna tell us where you've been spending your days

777
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:19,180
你这个冬天这些天在哪里度过的
for a couple of months this past winter?

778
00:56:20,216 --> 00:56:22,184
你的问题处理得怎么样了
What's going on with your disaster?

779
00:56:22,419 --> 00:56:24,182
电话断了 我们支付不起电费
Phone gets shut off. We can't pay the electricity.

780
00:56:24,287 --> 00:56:26,312
家具一个个逐渐在消失
Furniture is disappearing around here piece by piece.

781
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,989
George 住口 你不明白
George, stop it. You don't understand.

782
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:30,148
那你呢
Do you?

783
00:56:31,027 --> 00:56:33,154
那你知道Jack 这几周都在街上流浪
Do you know that Jack was wandering the streets for weeks,

784
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:34,730
假装去上班
pretending to go to work?

785
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:36,523
Jack 你解决这个问题了么
Did you get that sorted out, Jack?

786
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:37,842
或者像一个无家可归的人在
Or are you still working out

787
00:56:37,843 --> 00:56:39,830
咖啡店想办法
of a coffee shop booth like a homeless person?

788
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:41,059
Jack 住手
Jack, stop!

789
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:43,999
别打了
Stop it!

790
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:47,607
Jack 住手
Jack! Stop!

791
00:56:47,911 --> 00:56:49,538
放开我
Get off!

792
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:57,110
George!

793
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,732
Sally!

794
00:57:13,136 --> 00:57:14,569
Sally?

795
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,973
George!

796
00:57:20,877 --> 00:57:22,674
怎么啦 怎么了
What's going on? What happened?

797
00:57:37,694 --> 00:57:39,127
怎么回事
What's wrong?

798
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:43,591
为什么
What is it?

799
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:04,118
George.

800
00:58:04,654 --> 00:58:06,144
嘿 George
George, hey.

801
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,990
我只是想确认你是否还好
I just wanted to make sure you're all right.

802
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:16,732
George 我真的也不好过
I had a really hard time, George.

803
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,398
我发誓 我保证 我
I swear. I promise, I...

804
00:58:21,337 --> 00:58:23,100
我以为你说不会打她主意
I thought you were gonna leave it alone.

805
00:58:25,842 --> 00:58:27,241
我不是要说对不起
I'm not gonna say sorry.

806
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,211
是我不会更好么
Isn't it better that it's me?

807
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:35,975
相比那些他刚认识的惹人厌的家伙
As opposed to some douche bag she just met

808
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:39,317
这样你还不能正视她么
and wouldn't even let you look at her?

809
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,814
你还想我说谢谢嘛
You want me to thank you?

810
00:58:43,193 --> 00:58:44,751
我的确对她有感觉
I actually felt something.

811
00:58:46,396 --> 00:58:47,866
这个并不总是发生
That doesn't always happen.

812
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:49,991
已经很久没有这样的感觉了
It hasn't happened in a very long time.

813
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,934
我已经等的够久了
And I've lived long enough

814
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:55,137
我知道我应该立刻行动
to know that when it does, you should act on it.

815
00:58:58,575 --> 00:59:00,202
我认为你没有准备好
I didn't think you were ready.

816
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,745
我曾经认为你很酷
I thought you were so cool.

817
00:59:11,654 --> 00:59:13,645
我从来没有遇到这么酷的人
I never meet anyone cool.

818
00:59:55,465 --> 00:59:56,830
嗨
Hi.

819
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:58,493
嗨
Hi.

820
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:00,668
我不想呆在那里
I didn't want to be up there.

821
01:00:02,171 --> 01:00:03,866
那里是不太好呆
Can't have been fun for you.

822
01:00:05,942 --> 01:00:09,605
他摔断了锁骨 我们一整夜都在急症室
He broke his collarbone. We were in the ER all night.

823
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,077
我很抱歉 这本不该发生的
I'm so sorry. That should have never happened.

824
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,911
妈妈 是我先挑起的
Mom, I started it.

825
01:00:17,186 --> 01:00:19,620
他可都50岁了
He's a 50-year-old man.

826
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,755
他应该保护你的
He's supposed to protect you.

827
01:00:21,858 --> 01:00:23,883
妈妈 是我的错 我很无礼
Mom, I'm obnoxious, I'm deeply disrespectful.

828
01:00:23,993 --> 01:00:25,756
我们要离婚
We're getting a divorce.

829
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:38,936
不必如此 我确定他不会再这样了
Come on, I'm sure he'll never do it again.

830
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:43,711
既然他知道我能弄到他住院
Now that he knows I can hospitalize him.

831
01:00:46,149 --> 01:00:48,276
我们早就走到那一步了
We were already headed there.

832
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:51,615
一年前他做生意破产了
His business went bankrupt about a year ago,

833
01:00:51,721 --> 01:00:55,487
我想我应该相信他 支持他
and I thought I should have faith in him and support him.

834
01:00:55,692 --> 01:00:59,560
但是他总是找借口
But there was always some sort of excuse,

835
01:01:00,229 --> 01:01:02,663
总是说他会时来运转的
or his luck was about to turn.

836
01:01:02,765 --> 01:01:05,893
然后说服我把房子做抵押
So, he convinced me to mortgage the apartment,

837
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:07,799
再然后是我的生意
and then my own business.

838
01:01:08,605 --> 01:01:10,197
但总是不够
But it was never enough.

839
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,971
他就是个混蛋 我早该告诉你的
He's a sick man, and I should have told you,

840
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:16,760
但是你压力太大
but you were under enough

841
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:18,810
我不想再让你心烦意乱了
pressure and I didn't wanna distract you.

842
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:20,572
心烦意乱也不错
I like distractions.

843
01:01:22,185 --> 01:01:23,743
现在更严重了
It gets worse.

844
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,592
我得把房子卖了
I have to sell the apartment.

845
01:01:31,027 --> 01:01:32,426
你说什么
What?

846
01:01:33,229 --> 01:01:36,687
我的信用卡再也支撑不起这些债务了
The debt has erased my credit.

847
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,517
我该怎么办
What am I gonna do?

848
01:02:02,158 --> 01:02:03,853
我答应了
I'll do it.

849
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,825
别挂机
Hold on.

850
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:07,794
你只有三周时间了
You have three weeks.

851
01:02:07,997 --> 01:02:10,431
而且你还得上学 还要期末考
And you still have to come to school and take finals.

852
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:12,134
知道了没
You know that already?

853
01:02:13,569 --> 01:02:15,076
找你老师要以往的作业
Pick up your assignment packets

854
01:02:15,077 --> 01:02:17,266
少了一份 休想拿到毕业证
from your teachers. You miss one, no diploma.

855
01:02:17,473 --> 01:02:19,668
- 知道了 - 出去吧
- Okay. - Go.

856
01:02:23,246 --> 01:02:25,476
我考虑了很久 George
I've given this a lot of thought, George.

857
01:02:25,715 --> 01:02:27,774
我不认为我会宽容你
I don't think I'm being easy on you.

858
01:02:27,984 --> 01:02:30,851
我也不相信那些沉闷无趣的作业
I simply don't believe that dull, lifeless assignments

859
01:02:30,987 --> 01:02:33,512
可以用来衡量一个人的灵魂
are the measures of a person's soul.

860
01:02:36,325 --> 01:02:37,758
我只要一张
I want one,

861
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:40,395
有意义的画作
one meaningful work from you.

862
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:43,463
我要你审视自我 倾听心声
I want you to look in the mirror, listen to your gut,

863
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:47,864
与真实的自己对话
and make an image that speaks to the real you.

864
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:51,731
你在乎什么 相信什么
What you care about. What you believe.

865
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:55,634
可高山 可流水
It can be big, it can be small.

866
01:02:56,713 --> 01:02:59,079
就算画得再糟糕
It can be painted in bat shit.

867
01:03:00,616 --> 01:03:02,709
只要真诚无惧就可以
As long as it's honest and fearless.

868
01:03:04,153 --> 01:03:06,087
Harris 你的帮助我实在是无以为报
Harris, you have no idea how much this helps...

869
01:03:06,255 --> 01:03:08,723
停 停 以免你误会
But! But. The caveat.

870
01:03:08,925 --> 01:03:10,620
假若我觉得不对头
If I smell a rat,

871
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,434
你还是没能找到
if you didn't find something

872
01:03:12,435 --> 01:03:14,853
你一直没有勇气说的东西
you've never had the courage to say before,

873
01:03:15,064 --> 01:03:18,192
我是不会让你过的 你绝对毕不了业
I don't pass you. You don't get out of here.

874
01:03:19,135 --> 01:03:21,126
你的前途将化作乌有
All your work down the drain.

875
01:03:22,772 --> 01:03:24,899
走吧 快 现在可以走了
Now, go, get out of here.

876
01:03:29,045 --> 01:03:30,444
你还好吧
How are you?

877
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:33,812
你和Jack没啥事吧
How are things with Jack?

878
01:03:34,717 --> 01:03:36,617
真搞不懂 我和Dustin交往有什么问题吗
Look, what is so wrong with me seeing Dustin?

879
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:38,118
他告诉我他不会管的
He told me he was gonna leave it alone.

880
01:03:38,321 --> 01:03:40,061
但是你和他说我们没在一起
But you told him we weren't together!

881
01:03:40,062 --> 01:03:41,222
那你指望我说什么
What should I have said?

882
01:03:41,324 --> 01:03:42,814
问题是你想说什么
What did you wanna say?

883
01:03:42,925 --> 01:03:45,263
你又来了 心理游戏总是玩不够
There you go again with the mind games.

884
01:03:45,264 --> 01:03:47,362
背弃信用 残酷成性的贱妇
Treacherous, sadistic little hussy.

885
01:03:47,463 --> 01:03:50,921
George 我们之间没什么
George! There was nothing between us.

886
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:57,531
- 我很抱歉 - 不 你说得对
- I'm sorry. - No. You're right.

887
01:04:01,544 --> 01:04:02,967
我得走了 我要是不把这一年
I gotta go. I have to make up

888
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:05,275
堆积的家庭作业补完 就别想毕业了
a year's worth of homework or I don't graduate.

889
01:04:05,481 --> 01:04:07,779
- 什么 - 祝你和Dustin幸福愉快
- What? - Have fun with Dustin.

890
01:04:09,552 --> 01:04:11,986
介绍你俩认识我真是开心
I'm so pleased to have made the introduction.

891
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:15,056
这里很不错
And it's good.

892
01:04:15,158 --> 01:04:16,921
我们在这里有过几许美好回忆
We've had some great memories here, you know?

893
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:21,929
我们最好快点把这地方租下来
We should definitely look into signing a lease for this place.

894
01:04:22,131 --> 01:04:23,530
- 这太完美了 - 当然 当然
- It's absolutely perfect. - Sure, sure.

895
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:54,958
? What the rest did I was average ?

896
01:04:55,097 --> 01:04:58,260
? But I don't mind ?

897
01:04:59,068 --> 01:05:02,560
? Drawn on two sides without disguise ?

898
01:05:02,738 --> 01:05:04,968
? But I don't mind ?

899
01:05:07,743 --> 01:05:09,734
这间房不错 宝贝
It's a great room. Hi, honey.

900
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:15,949
? And you, you don't believe me ?

901
01:05:16,385 --> 01:05:19,479
? And I, I find it easy ?

902
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:24,390
? Easy ?

903
01:05:28,097 --> 01:05:33,933
? You're recruited head diluted through a glass eye ?

904
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:38,602
? Dreams in fiction lost religion ?

905
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:41,370
? But I don't mind ?

906
01:05:41,744 --> 01:05:48,650
? Cause I spit fire on lovers and liars ?

907
01:05:49,452 --> 01:05:52,216
? And you, you don't believe me ?

908
01:05:52,488 --> 01:05:55,719
? And I, I find it easy ?

909
01:05:55,925 --> 01:05:59,691
? Easy ?

910
01:06:18,547 --> 01:06:25,214
? And I, I spit fire on lovers and liars ?

911
01:06:25,354 --> 01:06:29,120
? And you, you don't believe me ?

912
01:06:29,225 --> 01:06:32,194
? And I, I find it easy ?

913
01:06:32,295 --> 01:06:33,262
? Easy ?

914
01:06:54,817 --> 01:07:01,689
? I, I spit fire on lovers and liars ?

915
01:07:01,824 --> 01:07:05,385
? And you won't deceive me ?

916
01:07:05,494 --> 01:07:08,554
? And I, I find it easy ?

917
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:11,165
? Easy ?

918
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:14,460
我把房子卖了
I think I'm done.

919
01:07:15,171 --> 01:07:16,570
我作业也完成了
Me, too.

920
01:07:18,507 --> 01:07:21,670
我们一家人从前过得很快乐
We had a lot of fun in the beginning, you, me, and your father.

921
01:07:22,578 --> 01:07:24,136
我也不知道为什么会变成这样
I don't get what happened.

922
01:07:24,981 --> 01:07:26,346
自从爸爸那事之后
After Dad.

923
01:07:26,682 --> 01:07:28,445
物换星移
Things change.

924
01:07:29,352 --> 01:07:32,253
有时候你甚至觉察不到变化
Sometimes so quickly you don't even notice it.

925
01:07:33,122 --> 01:07:34,443
也许吧 幸福
I don't know. Happiness is,

926
01:07:34,444 --> 01:07:36,353
就像你必须照顾好的东西
like, something you have to look after,

927
01:07:36,492 --> 01:07:37,857
要小心翼翼
be vigilant about.

928
01:07:39,762 --> 01:07:42,253
你知道Jack是爱我们的
I mean, you know that Jack loved us.

929
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:44,862
这不是什么黄粱美梦
That wasn't an illusion.

930
01:07:45,568 --> 01:07:47,468
他把你当作儿子般疼爱
He loved you like a son.

931
01:07:49,038 --> 01:07:50,562
你知道他现在在哪里吗
Do you know where he is now?

932
01:07:53,209 --> 01:07:54,574
不知道
No.

933
01:07:57,847 --> 01:08:00,509
对以后的人生有什么想法没
Do you have any idea of what you wanna do?

934
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:04,416
我想去读艺校
I wanna try and get into an art school.

935
01:08:06,655 --> 01:08:07,986
我需要专业的训练
I need real training.

936
01:08:25,754 --> 01:08:29,154
我想见你

937
01:08:40,356 --> 01:08:41,880
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

938
01:08:44,093 --> 01:08:47,790
一波未平一波又起 我心乱如麻
So much has happened, and so much is happening, and...

939
01:08:49,098 --> 01:08:51,896
我需要你这个朋友 好吗
I just need you to be my friend, okay?

940
01:08:53,035 --> 01:08:55,799
我真的 真的很需要你 求求你了
I really, really need that. Please.

941
01:09:03,245 --> 01:09:05,975
我妈妈要嫁给一个才认识三个月的人
My mom is marrying this guy she's known for three months

942
01:09:06,115 --> 01:09:07,742
还要搬去德州和他住一起
and moving to Texas to be with him.

943
01:09:08,217 --> 01:09:10,151
她已经走了
She's already down there.

944
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,117
结婚了 意味着她不能收赡养费了
Getting engaged means her alimony payment stops,

945
01:09:13,222 --> 01:09:17,318
也不能供我下年去Boulder读书了
which means she can't pay my tuition for Boulder next year,

946
01:09:17,626 --> 01:09:19,321
这相当于是说我出不去了
which means I don't get out.

947
01:09:20,563 --> 01:09:22,724
她想让我跟她一起搬去德州
She wants me to go live with her in Texas.

948
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,565
那你去吗
What are you gonna do?

949
01:09:26,268 --> 01:09:28,498
这很难决定
That's the hard part.

950
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:32,837
因为我明天就要走了
Because I'm leaving tomorrow.

951
01:09:33,876 --> 01:09:35,366
要去哪
Where are you going?

952
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:39,978
我和Dustin打算夏日背包游欧洲
Dustin and I are gonna backpack around Europe for the summer.

953
01:09:40,182 --> 01:09:42,616
他作品卖出去了 把这送我当礼物
His show sold out. It's his present to me.

954
01:09:44,186 --> 01:09:45,813
那毕业典礼怎么办
What about graduation?

955
01:09:47,056 --> 01:09:50,924
经历了这么多 我受够了 毕业证书就让他们寄给我吧
After everything, I'm over it. They can mail it to me.

956
01:09:51,093 --> 01:09:52,720
那Zoe和Will他们呢
And Zoe, Will, and...

957
01:09:52,895 --> 01:09:54,362
我很喜欢这些家伙
I love those guys,

958
01:09:55,998 --> 01:09:57,465
但那都不是真实的我
but that was never really me.

959
01:09:58,767 --> 01:10:00,132
那游完欧洲之后呢
And after Europe?

960
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,831
天知道 反正不会是德州
Who knows? Not Texas.

961
01:10:06,976 --> 01:10:08,341
我必须告诉你些东西
I need to tell you something.

962
01:10:12,248 --> 01:10:14,239
你说得对 某种程度上讲
You were right, in a way.

963
01:10:14,383 --> 01:10:16,943
我不该把话憋着不说的
I should've been able to say what I wanted to.

964
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:24,225
我爱上你了 已经很久很久了
I'm in love with you. I always have been.

965
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:32,375
我认为是你待我不公平
I thought you were the unfair one,

966
01:10:32,376 --> 01:10:34,435
但是于我而言我也没说
but it was unfair of me not to say it.

967
01:10:35,337 --> 01:10:36,804
所以 我就这么说了
So, I've said it.

968
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,475
我一无是处
I was nothing.

969
01:10:43,312 --> 01:10:45,041
我感觉自己一无是处
I felt like nothing.

970
01:10:46,048 --> 01:10:47,447
但是
Less than.

971
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:50,650
你改变了我
You changed that.

972
01:12:06,428 --> 01:12:08,726
你知道我们终有一天会在一起
You know we're gonna be together one day.

973
01:12:09,431 --> 01:12:12,400
我们都必须把身上的糟糕处境解决掉
We have to sort through all of our messed-up issues

974
01:12:12,635 --> 01:12:13,796
而你也只能
and you have to sleep with

975
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:15,763
多和几个女孩深交才能一吐为快
a lot of girls to get it out of your system.

976
01:12:17,106 --> 01:12:18,801
别走
Don't go.

977
01:12:18,941 --> 01:12:20,499
算我求你
Please.

978
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:22,099
人生很长
It's a long life.

979
01:12:22,811 --> 01:12:24,369
我们并不孤身一人
We're not done.

980
01:12:29,618 --> 01:12:33,110
背信弃言 残酷成性的贱货
Treacherous, sadistic little hussy.

981
01:12:38,027 --> 01:12:39,426
我也爱你
