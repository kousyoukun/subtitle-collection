00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,104
[male narrator] August 9th, 2:30 PM,
Greenwich Mean Time.

2
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,523
The HMS Churchill outward bound.

3
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,276
On board a joint British/American
space team.

4
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,445
Their mission:
to intercept and study

5
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,822
the comet bearing
Dr. Edmond Halley's name.

6
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,701
The Churchill is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.

7
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,662
It propels the Churchill
with constant acceleration,

8
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,457
enough to create Earth-type gravity
for the first time

9
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,334
on an extended flight.

10
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,796
The Churchill is on course
for its rendezvous.

11
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,714
Sir, this is odd.

12
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,757
What?

13
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,093
I'm getting a very small
radar cross section,

14
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,470
just ahead of the nucleus
in the coma of the comet.

15
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,971
I've got it too.

16
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,974
Check the length, Brendan,
it's at the limit of my angle of scan.

17
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,935
- What's going on?
- Did you chaps run an equipment check?

18
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,686
[female] I've been checking
every five minutes, sir.

19
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,730
Radar state's 150 miles.

20
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,816
- 150 miles what?
- Length.

21
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,567
Hundred and fifty miles long?

22
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,695
What's 150 miles long?

23
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,073
[beeping]
- It's a radar trace.

24
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,991
Something right ahead
in the coma of the comet.

25
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,034
Show me.

26
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,495
[male]
EGR's confirmed.

27
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,538
[female]
Looks good.

28
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,624
[male] EGR's optimal,
track three on three.

29
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,917
[female]
Roger.

30
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,879
What's the height of the thing?

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,757
I've got a vertical reading
of two miles, at least.

32
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,592
[digital voice]
Ambient temperature six degrees.

33
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,512
Iron less than 2%,
traces of manganese, titanium--

34
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,805
Try and raise base.

35
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:04,100
Tell them we have an artificial object
out here hidden in the--

36
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,601
Are you sure you want
to say hidden?

37
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,728
Tell them it's located
in the head of the comet.

38
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,481
Keep sending that
until they acknowledge.

39
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,191
Use a secured downlink.

40
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,361
Sorry, Commander, everything's
being swamped by the coma winds.

41
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,572
We can't get anything
back to base.

42
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,699
How long's the blackout period?

43
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,659
All the way.

44
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,505
What are you gonna do?

45
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,175
We're going in.

46
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,846
We're only gonna get
one chance, Derebridge.

47
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,851
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years.

48
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,769
And we'll both be dead.

49
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,772
We have to take a look now.

50
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,826
Shut down Nerva.

51
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,869
Shutting down.

52
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,704
Down one.
[click]

53
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,960
[male]
Deltas plus one in two seconds.

54
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,009
- Solar panels retracted.
- [female] Check.

55
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,719
Give me a readout, Bob.

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,006
[male #1]
Executing E.V.A. maneuver.

57
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:16,482
[male #2] Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

58
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,651
Was it exploring the comet,
do you think?

59
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,278
[male #1]
Come on guys, let's do it.

60
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,948
Surface looks badly pitted.

61
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,950
In that case,
it's been here a long time.

62
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,120
[male #2]
It's derelict, whatever it is.

63
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,373
[male #1] Stand by, Churchill,
we're goin' in.

64
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,041
[male on radio]
Roger, Carlsen, we copy.

65
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,293
We have you going in.

66
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:43,718
[female] Churchill, looks like
some sort of giant artery-- organic.

67
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,137
I almost have the feeling
I've been here before.

68
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,685
Oh, boy.

69
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,273
[breathing]

70
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,652
[male #1]
This is incredible.

71
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,989
I hope you can appreciate
the scale of this on the video.

72
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,240
Roger, we're getting it.

73
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,825
It's all on tape.

74
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,039
Oh, shit.

75
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, here they are.

76
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:29,263
Churchill, it looks like we found
the occupants of the ship.

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,810
They look like bats...giant bats.

78
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,199
[female] Churchill, there must be
hundreds of them.

79
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,118
[male]
Thousands...dead, I hope.

80
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,416
[breathing]

81
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,970
[male #1]
Looks prehistoric.

82
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,394
[crackles]

83
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,688
It's completely desiccated.

84
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,691
[breathing]

85
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,405
- Crumbled.
- Yes.

86
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,198
It would.

87
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,493
All the fluid's been lost to space
over the years.

88
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,078
[suit rockets firing]

89
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,422
We'll bag this one,
take it with us.

90
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,675
[male] We're deploying
the specimen bag.

91
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:09,447
[male] Jesus,
what the hell is that?

92
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,076
Commander,
the ship has just deployed a--

93
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,287
it looks like some sort
of big structure

94
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,331
that's just unfolding--
it's enormous!

95
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,044
God, what is it?

96
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,595
[female]
Better get out of here, sir.

97
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,513
Nobody's goin' anywhere,
stay where you are.

98
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,184
Churchill, this is Carlsen.

99
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,351
What's happening out there?

100
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,978
The thing stopped opening.

101
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,316
The only way to describe it is--
it's-- it's like a giant umbrella.

102
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,569
Good god, it's--
it's absolutely enormous.

103
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,946
Churchill, what's it doing now?

104
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,657
Nothing, sir.

105
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,163
It stopped opening.

106
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,582
It's just sitting there.

107
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,209
Tell what it's made of?

108
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,002
Not metal.

109
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,296
It's radar transparent.

110
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,886
Okay...if it starts up again,
let me know.

111
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,096
Any activity out there,
you understand?

112
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,598
Yes, sir.

113
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,149
That's where we're goin'.

114
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,253
Something there.

115
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,589
Commander,
this is Churchill.

116
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,923
We're losing our signal.

117
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,466
We've lost VTR.

118
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,093
Come in, Commander.

119
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,823
Bodies, three bodies.

120
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,742
Perfectly preserved.

121
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,748
They look to me to be like in--

122
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,000
Something's happening to me.

123
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,336
What's wrong...

124
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,089
with me, wha--
what's wrong?

125
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,187
[Churchill]
Commander, come in.

126
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,563
This is Churchill.

127
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,148
Do you copy?

128
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,656
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sleep.

129
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,366
[male]
Hold on, we're coming down.

130
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,558
[female] Churchill,
Churchill, if you read,

131
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,978
there are two nude males
and one female.

132
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,065
This is Churchill,
we have no picture.

133
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,400
Come in, Tom.

134
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:19,863
Churchill...I said we found
a young girl.

135
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,991
Girl?
You mean human?

136
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,202
Definitely humanoid.

137
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,829
[male]
I'd say she's perfect.

138
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,997
I've been in space for six months

139
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,041
and she looks perfect to me.

140
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,257
[female]
Derebridge, what's wrong?

141
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,717
[sighs]
What's wrong...

142
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,064
[sighs] How many
do you want to take back?

143
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,400
I say we take back all three.

144
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,362
One of the dead things
in the other chamber.

145
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,531
Well...

146
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,116
let's see
if we can break 'em free.

147
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,000
[clunk]

148
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,473
[male] Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.

149
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,558
Do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.

150
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,352
If they're going to pick us up,
they should get us this close.

151
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,605
[male] Simply aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.

152
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:38,484
Automatic circuits
don't even respond.

153
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,611
They're radio dead.

154
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,446
Christ.

155
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,531
I hope it's just
their communications.

156
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,366
[male]...do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.

157
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,828
[male] Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.

158
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,957
Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.

159
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,251
Do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.

160
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,336
How's their orbit look?

161
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,840
You can see it's stable,
but they're slightly off.

162
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,635
They should have adjusted coming in,
but they haven't.

163
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,428
[Dr. Bukovsky]
What do you make of that?

164
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,889
[male technician] It would appear
that they, uh, set their course

165
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,557
just after they left the comet.

166
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,976
I'd say it hasn't been
updated since.

167
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,814
[sighs]

168
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,483
The Columbia?

169
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,777
The Columbia.

170
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,280
[male]
Lift off, we have lift off.

171
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,829
[radio chatter]

172
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,675
Control, this is Columbia.

173
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,969
Are we clear
to initiate docking procedure?

174
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,555
[male on radio] Go ahead, Columbia,
you are looking good.

175
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,640
Stand by for soft dock.

176
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,768
[radio]
Soft dock.

177
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,813
[rumbling]

178
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,147
Soft dock confirmed.

179
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,785
[breathing]

180
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,556
Columbia,
the ship's completely gutted.

181
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,224
Oh, my God.

182
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,602
Houston, we have a problem.

183
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,479
There's been a fire.

184
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,527
I'll take a look in the tug bay.

185
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,904
You two try the top deck.

186
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,702
[breathing]

187
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,849
Columbia, they're all dead.

188
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,727
Nothing down here, Columbia.

189
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,396
I'm going on in to the tug bay.

190
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,150
I'll get the tapes.

191
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,102
Somner, I think there's something
you ought to see in the tug bay.

192
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,485
[chimes sounding]

193
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,580
I see-- how did you open
the girl’s case?

194
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,082
We didn't, Minister.

195
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,001
We were just talking
about how to get it open

196
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,128
when it popped open
of its own accord.

197
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,005
Did you x-ray the crystal cases?

198
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,506
We're not certain they're crystal.

199
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,050
The casings are not metallic.

200
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,635
I'm not even sure they're organic.

201
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,722
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there,

202
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,557
if that makes any sense.

203
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,725
And the bodies from the cases?

204
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,644
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

205
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,732
Provided, of course,
that Dr. Fallada agrees they're dead.

206
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,401
[phone ringing]

207
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,652
Fallada.

208
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,032
I don't know that I'm qualified
to pass judgment on alien death.

209
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,950
You would agree
that they're less alive than we are?

210
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,039
[male on TV] Yesterday
in Hong Kong, gold closed lower.

211
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,001
In light trading
on European currency markets,

212
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,378
the pound closed mixed
against the dollar

213
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,755
and West German mark

214
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,884
There will be a full market report
after the late news.

215
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,012
This is James Graham reporting
from the city.

216
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,139
Now back to the newsroom.

217
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,854
...developments as they arise.

218
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,233
Halley's Comet is now dominating
the northern skies,

219
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,485
stretching over a hundred million miles
across the heavens,

220
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,613
occupying one-sixth
of the entire visible horizon.

221
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,032
On this exceptionally clear night,

222
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,076
a group of enthusiasts are
commemorating

223
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,454
Dr. Edmond Halley's great prediction
by holding an outdoor watching

224
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,748
from the site of his original
observatory at Greenwich.

225
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,626
Our viewers may be interested
to know that comets

226
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,295
were once considered
to be harbingers of evil,

227
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,382
and that one of the earliest words
for comet was disaster,

228
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,759
which in Latin means evil star.

229
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,930
And it may indeed be an evil star
for the deep space probe, Churchill.

230
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,266
There's still no word
from Her Majesty's Government

231
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,686
as to the fate of the crew,
whether they're alive or dead.

232
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,771
We can only await
further developments.

233
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,403

Bukovsky, where--
where's the girl!

240
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,888
She's gone.

241
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,518
I saw her.

242
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,108
She did that.

243
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,736
[buzzes]
Security.

244
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,571
Hello, Professor Fallada here.

245
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,949
I'm calling at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

246
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,284
Get me the Duty Security Captain now.

247
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,744
Yes, sir.

248
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,748
Don't worry, a naked girl is not going
to get out of this complex.

249
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,455
Four nine to Control.

250
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,124
You'll never believe
what I'm looking at.

251
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,962
Control, can you say that again?

252
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,338
I believe you heard me.

253
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,174
There's a girl on the loose
in the building.

254
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,758
She must not leave.

255
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,595
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

256
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,346
That's right, that's what I said.

257
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,598
Surely, you can find her.

258
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,932
Must be some kinda joke.

259
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,565
I don't believe it.

260
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,236
All right, Miss,
just stay where you are.

261
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,280
You heard 'em,
they said grab her.

262
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,492
Take it easy, Link,
she's not in her right mind.

263
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:38,953
Control, Control, we have located
the girl in the main lobby.

264
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,248
[whispering]
That's it, come on.

265
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,125
[buzzes]
Yes.

266
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,543
We've located the girl, sir.

267
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,046
- Where?
- She's downstairs in the main lobby.

268
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,506
Right.

269
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,049
She's in the main lobby.

270
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,219
- You all right to go down there?
- No.

271
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,555
Come on, nice and easy.

272
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,182
Come on.

273
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,518
Come to me.

274
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,520
Come to daddy, come on.

275
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,657
Make it stop, make it stop!

276
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,785
Come on, let's get her.

277
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,081
[yells]

278
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,993
[dog barking]

279
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,542
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah.

280
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,419
[mixed chatter]

281
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,102
[sirens approach]

282
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,314
[siren louder]

283
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,986
[male on PA] Will all non-involved
personnel please clear the area.

284
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:40,408
I repeat-- Will everybody who has no
business to be here,

285
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,329
please clear the area
for your own safety.

286
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,748
This is a police announcement.

287
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,334
Please keep right back--

288
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,461
- Sorry, gentlemen, no photos please.
- Hey!

289
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,049
Sorry.

290
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,051
May I ask which of you
is Dr. Bukovsky?

291
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,803
I am.

292
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,347
I'm Colonel Caine.

293
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,556
From the S.A.S.?

294
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,142
Gentlemen, that last remark
is not for publication.

295
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,560
This is a D Notice situation.

296
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,409
Not too close.

297
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,750
And this was murder...
you say?

298
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,216
Tell me again how the girl
overpowered you.

299
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,137
She, uh...

300
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,809
was the most overwhelmingly
effeminate presence

301
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,769
I've ever encountered.

302
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,146
I was drawn to her
on a level that--

303
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,523
Was it sexual?

304
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,234
Yes, overwhelmingly so.

305
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,404
And horrible.

306
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:01,572
Loss of control.

307
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,908
And the man, the guard, was dead
when you came into the room?

308
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,118
You found him as he is now?

309
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,120
Yeah.

310
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,706
And the girl, she came
from the ship, Churchill?

311
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,958
Uh-huh.

312
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,835
She spoke to you?

313
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,461
In English?

314
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,088
That's right.

315
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,798
How would she know English?

316
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,175
Now, going back--

317
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,845
you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire?

318
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,013
No, they weren't destroyed
in the fire.

319
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,932
That's what we were told
to tell the public.

320
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,016
They were erased.

321
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,059
Erased?

322
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,437
Also, the Churchill’s escape pod
is missing.

323
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,063
What's that mean,
did someone escape?

324
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,231
They don't know.

325
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,650
Unfortunately,
the condition of the bodies

326
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,027
make an accurate count impossible.

327
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,488
Could the heat from the fire
have launched the pod?

328
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,073
No, no, no.

329
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,702
What started the fire?

330
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,416
The ship's oxygen system ignited.

331
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,127
It was a terribly hot fire.

332
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,714
Yet, you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

333
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,842
- That's correct. [sighs]
- Where were they found?

334
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,636
In the bay where the space tug
was stored.

335
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,221
Where everything else
was charred.

336
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,641
Incredible.

337
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,934
Is it not?

338
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,144
[click]

339
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,271
Have you examined the cases?

340
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,484
Using every technique we have.

341
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,528
X-ray scans of the cases
yield only blurred images.

342
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,613
What does that mean?

343
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,783
They're not precisely physical objects.

344
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,701
More like a sort of force field.

345
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,829
We're a bit out of our depth here.

346
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,247
The whole thing is--

347
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,624
Yes, I know.

348
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,042
Incredible.

349
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,128
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard?

350
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,088
No, I suppose not.

351
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,465
What about your two other bodies?

352
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,637
Colonel, may I be excused?

353
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,389
I seem to be feeling a little more
nauseous than I thought.

354
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,349
Yes, of course.

355
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,820
I notice from your door, Dr. Fallada,
that your area is biochemistry.

356
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,781
But I understand
your real interest is--

357
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,200
Death, Colonel Caine, correct.

358
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,369
Thanatology is the name for it.

359
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,497
Death for you, Colonel, is a
bureaucratic problem-- who did it?

360
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,541
When and why did they do it?

361
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,459
A problem to be solved,
am I correct?

362
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,836
And for you?

363
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,088
Well, I'm fascinated
by death itself--

364
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,798
What happens as we die,
when we die.

365
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,174
What happens after we die?

366
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,926
You mean, life after death.

367
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,177
Yes.

368
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,345
- Is there?
- What?

369
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,471
Life after death.

370
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,724
Do you really want to know?

371
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,434
No.

372
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,107
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

373
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:45,152
If I am correct,
the life force is conserved

374
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,488
always and in all things,
even after death.

375
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,324
And you think that applies
to what's happened here tonight?

376
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,368
Yes.

377
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,245
Yes, I do.

378
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,206
I think that girl, creature,

379
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,334
drained energy,
life force,

380
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,005
partially from Bukovsky
and totally from the guard.

381
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,965
A vampire?

382
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,843
It could be described that way, yes.

383
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,845
I mean, in a sense,
we're all vampires.

384
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,973
We drain energy
from other life forms.

385
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,350
The difference is one of degree.

386
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,604
That girl was no girl.

387
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:24,400
She's totally alien to this planet
and our life form.

388
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,485
And totally dangerous.

389
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,233
Jesus.

390
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,653
[whispering]
Do you believe those blokes are alive?

391
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,529
I'm not paid to believe nothing, am I?

392
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,826
I believe they're alive.

393
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,957
Don't look bloody dead to me.

394
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,728
[alarm sounds]

395
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,388
We've had some trouble,
but everything's under control.

396
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,807
I think you better
come down here.

397
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,560
Yes, sir...very good, sir.

398
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,536
It would appear these two
are no longer dangerous.

399
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,332
Well, there's certainly no possibility
of doing a full autopsy on them.

400
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,169
I would like to examine the guard.

401
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,212
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

402
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,338
I believe so, sir.

403
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,844
This is an autopsy on the body
of a young man,

404
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,763
dead approximately two hours.

405
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:00,806
Did you say he was about 20?

406
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,141
Yes, that's correct.

407
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:03,976
[clangs]

408
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:13,819
[roars]

409
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,113
[groans]

410
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,086
Get the Colonel down here,
quickly!

411
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,969
[groaning]

412
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,595
[moaning]

413
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,182
God.

414
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,893
Put him in an isolation cell,
quickly!

415
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,019
Sergeant.

416
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,731
[moaning and yelling]

417
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,163
I had no idea
that it could be passed on.

418
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,040
What do you suggest?

419
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,668
I would recommend that you place
this body in another cell.

420
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,837
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

421
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,591
I won't be at all surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

422
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,426
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Yes, sir.

423
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,511
Also, I want the two other bodies
that were shot-- the males.

424
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,263
Collect the pieces and watch them.

425
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,848
Get me the Home Secretary
on the line now.

426
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,433
Sir.

427
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,018
Call for the Colonel, sir.

428
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,519
Sir, you have a call.

429
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,729
Caine.

430
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,522
Sir, we've found
a naked girl in Hyde park.

431
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,566
The body is
in an indescribable condition.

432
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,943
I'll be right there.

433
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,153
They've just found a body
in Hyde Park.

434
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,363
A naked girl.

435
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,782
They say she's
in an indescribable condition.

436
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:06,992
Could that be your girl?

437
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,204
- Well?
- That's not her.

438
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,665
Inspector, what about the two boys?

439
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,541
Oh, yes, they were
in the park earlier, sir.

440
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,709
[chimes sounding]

441
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,336
Yeah, we saw her.

442
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,587
I think.

443
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:19,922
Earlier.

444
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,591
Any rate,
that looks like her hair.

445
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,177
- What a mess.
- Was she alone?

446
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,221
No, that's why we notices her.

447
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,806
She was with a dark haired girl.

448
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,349
Real good looking bird and all.

449
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,268
Didn't have a lot of clothes on either.

450
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,311
We thought they might be--
well, you know.

451
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,646
Yes.

452
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,856
Well, did you see where they went,
where the dark haired girl went?

453
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,942
No, no, we didn't.

454
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,278
We angled on back
to see if maybe we could--

455
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,613
you know,
see 'em doing something.

456
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,825
- That's when we found her.
- How long ago was that?

457
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,867
Half an hour ago.

458
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,995
Yeah, this lad phoned us
and then we phoned you, sir.

459
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,163
Yes, thank you, Inspector.

460
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,835
Obviously, the work of the girl.

461
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,880
You think we can have this body sent
back to the center with the others?

462
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,507
Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.

463
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,343
Inspector, let me know if you find
anything else, will you?

464
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,720
We'll be taking her back with us.

465
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:08,887
Very good, sir.

466
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,515
[sighs]

467
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,933
Now she has clothes.

468
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,229
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

469
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,108
[banging]

470
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,738
[yelling]

471
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,993
Dr. Hans Fallada, Sir Percy Heseltine,
the Home Secretary.

472
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,454
You're just in time.

473
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,247
[banging]

474
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,874
It's exactly two hours.

475
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,345
[whispering]
Please help me.

476
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,723
This is the guard who was originally
overcome by the space girl.

477
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,061
[yells]

478
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:03,525
Please.

479
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,864
[growling]

480
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,345
As I feared,
once transformed,

481
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,390
the victims need
regular infusions of energy.

482
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,432
Otherwise--

483
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,767
Otherwise what?

484
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,417
[whispering]
Oh, my God.

485
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,379
Dear God.

486
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:10,884
And down here we have the pathologist
who was attacked by the guard.

00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,063
- See.
- He too needs feeding.

[growls]

490
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,124
The same thing is going to happen
to that girl we found in the park.

491
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,585
In about one hour.

492
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:47,171

[mixed voices]

495
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,844
She's the last?

496
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,555
Have there been
any further reports, Kelly?

497
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,974
No, sir, we set up
to get the calls here

498
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,141
the instant one comes in.

499
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,102
- What?
- Nothing.

500
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,438
You say these creatures were brought
back from the Churchill?

501
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,898
Yes, sir, but not this one.

502
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,775
She's a victim of the creatures.

503
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,903
Yes, yes, but where did
the Churchill acquire them?

504
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,197
We have no way
of determining that at present.

505
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,491
- [male] Perhaps that's all changing.
- What?

506
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,286
I've just received a call
from the JPL in Pasadena.

507
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,955
Seems the Goldstone tracking disc has
just picked up something

508
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,040
they think is Churchill’s escape pod--

509
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,710
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

510
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,086
Where?

511
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,421
Texas.

[mixed voices]

513
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,390

Come on, guys, hurry it up.

514
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,645
[mixed voices continue]

515
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,490
All right, take it easy now.

516
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,783
Hey, buddy, you all right?

517
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,456
Where?

518
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,374
Walter Reed Army Hospital?

519
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,168
Is he hurt?

520
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,586
Just exhausted, you say.

521
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,129
Well, get him the hell over here!

522
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,885
Colonel Carlsen,
they're expecting you, sir.

523
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,597
Colonel Carlsen, sir.

524
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,308
[Bukovsky]
Tom.

525
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,272
I thought you were dead.

526
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,274
Bukovsky.

527
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,943
Colonel Carlsen,
allow me to introduce

528
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,945
Colonel Caine
of the Special Air Services.

529
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,197
How do you do?

530
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,032
You already know Dr. Fallada.

531
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,116
Colonel.

532
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,661
Take a seat, won't you?

533
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,668
I'm sorry to drag you
over here like this, Tom.

534
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:15,253
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

535
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,009
Tom, we've got to know
what happened on the Churchill.

536
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,344
Yes, of course.

537
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:31,061
It may be, uh...very difficult for you
to accept what I'm going to say.

538
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,522
We'll have very little difficulty

539
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:35,315
believing anything
you have to tell us, Colonel.

540
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,692
Do go on.

541
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,527
You know something?

542
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,570
There was a fire
aboard the Churchill.

543
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,281
You might be interested to know

544
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,493
that the bodies of the three humanoids
were not destroyed in that fire.

545
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,328
They survived in their cases.

546
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,706
They were brought
down here to London,

547
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,290
and the female has escaped.

548
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,042
She's killed three people already.

549
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,170
Oh, my God.

550
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,300
So you see, Colonel, whatever
you have to tell us is rather pressing.

551
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,428
Please tell us what happened.

552
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,891
We found the bodies
aboard the alien spacecraft.

553
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,060
What alien spacecraft?

554
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,523
Colonel, take it
from the beginning.

555
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,400
Assume we know nothing.

556
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,444
Which is understating the matter.

557
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,907
We approached within 9,000 miles
of Halley's Comet,

558
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,164
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

559
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,500
After we discovered
the bodies,

560
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,377
we transferred them
to the Churchill.

561
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,755
We have in tow,
the three humanoid creatures

562
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:41,256
and one of the bat-like things.

563
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,924
[male on radio]
This is Churchill, we copy.

564
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,176
Welcome back.

565
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,470
You gotten through
to Earth yet, Rawlings?

566
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,514
No, sir, and the tail
of the comet's heating up.

567
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,979
What's the matter Derebridge?

568
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,355
I don't know, Tom.

569
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,983
I feel drained.

570
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,234
Do you?

571
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,696
I feel invigorated.

572
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:05,947
You okay?

573
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,241
Yeah.

574
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,453
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

575
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,999
Everybody back
to their stations.

576
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,461
Let's get the hell outta here.

577
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:28,261
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die--

578
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,930
one by one.

579
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:38,480
Rawlings, the radio officer,
was the first to go.

580
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,994
Rawlings denied any knowledge
of what he had done.

581
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,454
I don't remember.

582
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,499
Rawlings,

583
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,211
besides myself, you're the only one
that's been up here

584
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,963
in the last hour.

585
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,299
I've been feeling weak recently.

586
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,134
Not myself.

587
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:12,138
Just don't remember.
[sighs]

588
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,657
We found Rawlings' body
the next day.

589
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,211
Exactly how did he die, Colonel?

590
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,214
The life just drained out of him.

591
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,555
One by one...

592
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,602
the rest of the crew
began to die.

593
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,940
Somehow...

594
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,278
I don't know how...

595
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,949
I held out.

596
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,247
It just seemed to be
a matter of will.

597

[motor starts]

598
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,375

[clunk]

600
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,215
the girl...

601
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,677
Yes, the girl?

602
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,269
I can't remember.

603
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,287
What I remember next is the view
out of the observation window--

604
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,873
coming in to Earth's orbit.

605
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,837
I couldn't expose the world
to what we'd brought back with us.

606
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,143
[high-pitched humming]

[clunk]

608
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,712
I was determined
to destroy them all.

609
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,658
It was the hardest thing
I ever did.

610
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,118
We understand.

611
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,996
Must have taken great courage
to try and make--

612
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,539
No, you don't understand.

613
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,709
Part of me didn't wanna leave.

614
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:14,172
She killed all my friends
and I still didn't want to leave.

615
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:17,842
Leaving her was
the hardest thing I ever did.

616
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:24,265
Colonel Carlsen
looks exhausted to me.

617
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,851
I think we should allow him
to get some sleep.

618
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,478
Continue with this later.

619
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,979
Very well.

620
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,358
Thank you, Colonel.

621
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,500
[clunk]

622
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:03,596
NASA tracking and ours

623
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:07,976
have just reported and unusual
structure leaving Halley's Comet.

624
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,602
It's headed for us.

625
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,562
What is it?

626
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:15,066
Radar ranging reports
the object is a needle-like shape,

627
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,818
one hundred and fifty miles long.

628
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,155
Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit

629
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,031
in a little more than two days.

630
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,702
Oh, and I've just received a call
from the Prime Minister.

631
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,955
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

632
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,999
[sighs]
PM wants answers.

[labored breathing]

634
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,152
Close your eyes.

635
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,787
You're giving me your life.

636
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,132
You're taking it.

637
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,741
You're draining me.

638
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,578
You're taking too much of me.

639
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,262
[screams]

640
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,440
It was a dream.

641
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,691
Just a dream.

642
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:02,817
What dream, Carlsen?

643
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,445
The girl, she visited me.

644
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:07,739
Visited you,
visited you how?

645
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,157
In my mind.

646
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,995
She...she...she...

647
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,539
she had some kind
of mental contact with me.

648
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,833
She's draining me.

649
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,752
Tell us about the dream, Carlsen.

650
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,756
I can't, it's gone.

651
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,216
It's faded.

652
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,259
I can't remember.

653
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,928
Carlsen, have you ever
been hypnotized?

654
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,055
No.

655
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,264
Do you mind
if I have a go at it?

656
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,141
It may help you
with your dreams.

657
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,310
Yeah, let's try it.

658
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,979
Not now, he's too exhausted.

659
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,482
Fine, fine, in the morning.

660
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:45,401
Just stare at it
until your eyes feel tired.

661
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,861
Then close them.

662
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,654
You'll feel very tired.

663
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,075
Very sleepy.

664
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,785
She seems to...

665
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,663
speak to me in my dreams.

666
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:01,793
She...

667
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,922
the girl, I feel...

668
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,133
What do you feel
for her, Carlsen?

669
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,179
I feel very...

670
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,972
close to her.

671
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,724
Is she in touch with you?

672
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,644
I feel...

673
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,563
as if my mind...

674
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:26,067
is not entirely my own.

675
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,362
If she is in contact
with your mind, Carlsen,

676
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,697
perhaps you are
in contact with hers.

677
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,117
Can you see her?

678
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,702
Can you see where she is?

679
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,330
Yes.

680
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,457
Where is she now, Carlsen?

681
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,086
A place, I don't know
the name of it.

682
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,879
She's walking.

683
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,591
She has a different face.

684
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,260
But it's her.

685
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,804
[Fallada] A different face,
how can that be?

686
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,514
She's using a different body.

687
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,308
[Fallada]
What is she doing?

688
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,018
She's looking for a man.

689
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,728
[Fallada]
What man?

690
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,064
Any man.

691
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,774
A healthy man.

692
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,401
[Fallada]
Does she intend to kill him?

693
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,570
- No.
- Why not?

694
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,280
She's afraid of being caught.

695
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:14,031
[Fallada]
How could she be caught?

696
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,575
The body'd give her away.

697
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,785
[Fallada]
So, what is she hoping to do?

698
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,412
She wants to...

699
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,039
draw some energy from him.

700
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,917
Not enough to kill him.

701
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,627
[Fallada]
She can do that?

702
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,504
Yes.

703
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,298
There's another mind.

704
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,884
[whispering]
Yes...

705
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,846
the girl’s name is Ellen.

706
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,557
You mean there are
two people in one body?

707
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:40,975
Two minds?

708
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,187
Ellen and the vampire?

709
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,771
Yes.

710
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,026
She's watching a man.

711
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,153
[Fallada]
What is the man doing?

712
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,072
He's parked--

713
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,741
Doing something with his car.

714
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,495
[whispers]
License number.

715
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:05,082
Can you see
the license number of his car?

716
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,584
[whispers]
Yes.

717
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,086
Read it out.

718
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:11,881
F-M-C

719
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,052
1-2-9-E.

720
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,888
Or, uh...R.

721
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,681
[Fallada]
What is the make of the car?

722
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:26,103
A white Volvo.

723
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,192
[Fallada]
What is she doing now?

724
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,529
They're driving.

725
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,948
[Fallada]
Does she ask him his name?

726
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,617
She's...

727
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,037
pulling her skirt...

728
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,748
over her knees.

729
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,626
She's...

730
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,878
He's...

731
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,589
putting his...

732
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,551
his...

733
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,094
hand...

734
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,639
on her le-- on her leg.

735
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,782
F-M-C-1-2-9-E or possibly R,

736
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,867
belonging to a white Volvo.

737
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,203
The driver of the car picked up
a girl named Ellen.

738
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,914
I have to know who the girl is
and where we can find her.

739
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,000
She's connected with the case.

740
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,419
I can't explain
over an open line.

741
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,296
Thank you.

742
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:34,547
[phone clunks]

743
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,882
Do you think he's telling
the truth about the girl?

744
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,801
Well, we'll soon see.

745
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:43,514
How brilliant if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind.

746
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:46,976
Taking only a small amount
of energy from each victim.

747
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,229
It would make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

748
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,981
She's hoping
to leave no trail.

749
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:55,192
If the girl is no longer
in her original body,

750
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,360
where is her body?

751
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:58,821
Hidden.

752
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,281
Let's find it.

753
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,160
Supposing you're right
about all of this,

754
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,745
what about that ship up there?

755
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:07,622
What's it doing?

756
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:09,498
We can't know that.

757
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,959
But we've got
to assume the worst.

758
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,337
Maybe they're like
the vampires of legend.

759
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,296
How's that?

760
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,090
They would carry
their earth with them--

761
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,801
in their coffins, wouldn't they?

762
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,973
[male] We have
a three meter feed from Hawaii.

763
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,683
[male #2]
Here it comes.

764
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,810
[male]
Put it on screen number one.

765
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:34,523
Coming in 240,000 miles.

766
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,984
My God, it's immense.

767
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:01,676
I say, Hugh, do you have
that skin tissue sample I asked for?

768
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:02,802
Oh, good.

769
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,805
Yes, of course I'll follow
containment procedure.

770
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,057
He's here now.

771
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,851
And Hugh,
send in that soldier, please.

772
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,481
Oh, thank you.

773
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:43,426
[knocking]

774
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,099
Dr. Fallada?

775
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,434
Just one moment, Sergeant.

776
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:52,560
Thank you for coming around.

777
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,146
I'll be with you shortly.

778
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,617
Bloody awful job,
tracing that car.

779
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,871
It belongs to a man named Ned Price
who lives in Yorkshire.

780
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:13,789
We have him
under detention now.

781
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,832
What about the girl?

782
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,501
The girl he picked up was
a nurse named Ellen.

783
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,587
As you said,
Ellen-something-or-other.

784
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:20,921
He doesn't know her other name.

785
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,132
And he dropped her off
at Thurlstone Hospital

786
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,050
after spending
the afternoon with her.

787
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,969
He was most reluctant
to talk about it.

788
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,305
The man's totally exhausted.

789
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,931
Thurlstone.

790
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,850
Isn't that an asylum
of some sort?

791
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,936
Yes, for the criminally insane.

792
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,897
[helicopter rotors]

793
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:01,253
How do you do, Home Secretary,
I'm Dr. Armstrong,

794
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,963
director of the hospital.

795
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,465
Come with me to my office.

796
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,679
What a cold night.

797
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,889
Bitterly cold.

798
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,517
This is the nurse's house.

799
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,896
Ellen Donaldson is number five.

800
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,314
Thank you.
[chimes sound]

801
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:23,025
Shouldn't I come up
and introduce you?

802
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,109
I'd rather you didn't.

803
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,236
Come along, Dr. Armstrong,

804
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:26,987
you and I have several matters
to discuss.

805
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,197
Come along.

806
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,495
[female on intercom]
Yes, who is it?

807
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,372
Miss Donaldson,
my name's Colin Caine.

808
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,873
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

809
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,083
Id' like to talk to you.

810
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,251
May I come in?

811
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,670
[door buzzes and clicks]

812
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,178
Yes?

813
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,682
What do you want?

814
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:55,975
My name's Colin Caine.

815
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:58,894
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.

01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,896
May we come in
and talk to you?

817
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,565
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

818
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:13,951
May I sit down?

819
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,915
I want to ask you about the man
you spent the afternoon with,

820
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,500
Ned Price.

821
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,546
I don't know
what you're talking about.

822
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,298
I think you do.

823
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:28,757
Let me see your hand.

824
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,884
Beg your pardon?

825
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,557
You're in there, aren't you?

826
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:40,102
I don't know.

827
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,312
Tell me.

828
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:42,396
No!

829
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,523
Carlsen!

830
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,528
It's gone from her,
it's in another body now.

831
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:50,654
How do you know that?

832
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,948
I can see it in her mind.

833
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,284
[whimpering]

834
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,577
She's resisting.

835
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,203
I'm gonna have
to force her to tell me.

836
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:02,207
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

837
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,376
An extreme masochist.

838
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,754
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

839
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:09,673
She wants me to hurt her.

840
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,384
I can see the images
in her mind.

841
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,761
Do you want to stay?

842
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:15,429
Otherwise, wait outside!

843
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,597
Not at all.

844
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,515
I am a natural voyeur.

845
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,105
Are you in there?

846
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,740
[cries]

847
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,741
Are you there?

848
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,289
Let go.

849
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,959
Now!

850
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,126
[screams]
Now!

851
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,336
Now!

852
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:38,929
Well?

853
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,723
I've got a physical description.

854
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,233
Doctor, you'd better send someone
to look after Nurse Donaldson.

855
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,443
Is she all right?

856
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:54,945
If I described one of the inmates
to you, could you identify him?

857
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,321
Possibly.

858
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:59,533
Big man, fat, gray hair.

859
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,826
Birthmark on his face.

860
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,787
Jeffrey Sykes,
the child murderer.

861
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,456
Where did you get
his description?

862
01:08:05,457 --> 01:08:07,541
Where is he now?

863
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,710
He's in solitary confinement.

864
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,086
He's been naughty.

865
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,713
Look, what is this about?

866
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,256
What we're looking for
has moved.

867
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,674
We could be here some time.

868
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,342
I better call London.

869
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,179
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.

870
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,680
We have to see Sykes now.

871
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,307
Oh, couldn't this wait
until the morning?

872
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:27,186
Oh, all right, I'll arrange it.

873
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,146
Anything to oblige,
Commander.

874
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,028
[click]

875
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,030
I wish this were not
so mysterious.

876
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:41,617
If the police are involved,
haven't I a right to know?

877
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,119
I mean, if you're going to start
messing about my patient.

878
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,250
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

879
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:54,213
However, I can tell you it is a matter
of national security.

880
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,672
I see.

881
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:59,218
But, don't you think
that I should be present in any case

882
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,136
to represent the interests
of my patient.

883
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,097
- You see--
- Can I talk to you for a second?

884
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:04,223
Of course.

885
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:08,185
Uh...the man has the IQ
of a child of four.

886
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,395
Well, that's a decision,
I'm afraid,

887
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,272
I shall have to defer
to Colonel Caine.

888
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,774
Yes, of course
you can come along.

889
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:15,109
Can we start now?

890
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,652
What are you going
to do to him?

891
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,238
I'd like to hypnotize him.

892
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,243
What's that?

893
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,787
Pentothal and morphine.

894
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:30,499
I'd recommend it for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

895
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:44,263
Well, he seems quiet.

896
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,723
We're ready when you are.

897
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,559
- Lamson.
- Sir.

898
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,119
[snores]

899
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,917
Can the injection be dangerous?

900
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,920
He should have
no difficulty tolerating it.

901
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,297
There's always a risk, sir.

902
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,466
May I have that?

903
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,428
Well, I'll wake him up.

904
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,391
- What are you doing!
- Stay where you are.

905
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,311
He's sick, Lamson, help us,
I can't explain now.

906
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,896
[yells]

907
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,482
There's our killer, Sir Percy.

908
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,612
[mixed voices yelling]

909
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:08,388
It's madness.

910
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,142
I want to question him
before it wears off.

911
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,518
Where can we take him?

912
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,770
Up the ramp, sir.

913
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,484
[voices calling out]

914
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,624
We need to be alone
for a minute, Lamson.

915
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,593
How the devil
did you know it was him?

916
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,388
In the nurses quarters
he touched me on the shoulder.

917
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,724
I saw into his mind.

918
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,894
What?

919
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,772
The Colonel appears to be able
to see in the minds

920
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:02,025
of people who have been possessed
by the girl creature, sir.

921
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,278
It happens when I touch 'em.

922
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,407
Let's get him on the table.

923
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,041
How?

924
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,712
How do you know
she's still inside Armstrong?

925
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:24,256
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone else?

926
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,925
She's trapped.

927
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,635
I can feel that.

928
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,053
Are you sure?

929
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,265
No.

930
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,354
- Lamson.
- Sir?

931
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,189
Can you bring me another dose
of the hypnotic drug?

932
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,233
I suppose so, sir.

933
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,693
One dose is usually enough.

934
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,236
This is not a usual situation.

935
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:49,114
How long does the stuff last?

936
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,324
A dose like that?

937
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:51,283
A couple of hours.

938
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,077
We'll definitely need more.

939
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:56,580
Bring me three doses.

940
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:58,623
- Three?
- I'll take responsibility, Lamson--

941
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,334
Sir Percy and myself,
just get on with it.

942
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,086
Yes, sir.

943
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:06,840
Is a second dose safe?

944
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,842
Surely it can strain his heart.

945
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:12,846
Look...you don't know
what we're dealing with here.

946
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:15,849
If he slips out from under,

947
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,518
she'll escape.

948
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:35,619
Armstrong, can you hear me?

949
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,832
Armstrong, if you can hear me,
just say yes.

950
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,798
It...
it...

951
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,133
won't let me...

952
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:54,221
ta-- talk to you.

953
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:00,977
[yells]

954
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,283
Armstrong,
Armstrong!

955
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,370
Can you see what it is
that's holding you prisoner?

956
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:25,335
Yes, yes, she--

957
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,045
Tell her she has
to talk to me!

958
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:28,380
Tell her!

959
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,756
- [knocking]
- Yes?

960
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,345
Pentothal,
I brought the pentothal.

961
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:37,013
Thanks, Lamson, that'll be all.

962
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,563
No.

963
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:45,772
Hold him.

964
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,449
[female alien voice]
There's no need for that.

965
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,326
No need.

966
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,427
You in there,

967
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:17,929
can you still hear me?

968
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,310
Can you get into his mind?
Her mind?

969
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,645
Not with this drug,
it's like a wall.

970
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,397
Perhaps you've given him
too much.

971
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:29,274
- Perhaps we--
- Shut up!

972
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,906
Listen, you bitch,

973
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:40,118
I'll keep you in this state
for weeks, if I have to.

974
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,828
Now, you talk to me.

975
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:44,498
Carlsen, be with me.

976
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,917
What do you want from me?

977
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,210
I love you.

978
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,007
What are you?

979
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,926
Why are you so human?

980
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,511
So perfect?

981
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,805
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

982
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,600
Our bodies are unimportant.

983
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:07,437
As you and your men
have approached in your ship,

984
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,105
we changed them.

985
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,148
For you.

986
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,984
We entered your minds

987
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,903
and found there new bodies.

988
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,323
I took my shape
from your mind.

989
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,076
I took your language.

990
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,829
I became the woman
I found there,

991
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:27,123
in your deepest thoughts,

992
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,626
your deepest needs.

993
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,214
I am the feminine
in your mind, Carlsen.

994
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,635
[whispering]
Where are you?

995
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,471
Where are you!

996
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,349
Where's your body!

997
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:51,314
Let me go!
Let me go!

998
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,319
Touch me, Carlsen.

999
01:16:56,862 --> 01:17:00,574
Let me go.

1000
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:05,996
Let me go!

1001
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:11,042
Let me go.
Let me go!

1002
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,547
Let me go!

1003
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:23,263
Let me go.

1004
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,669
- It's already spreading.
- How?

1005
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:37,379
You didn't stop it,
it's too late.

1006
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,006
That's impossible, we've been only
half a step behind her all the way.

1007
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,257
Sir, this gentleman's
stopped breathing.

1008
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,511
There's no pulse either.

1009
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,815
Sir, I think his neck is broken.

1010
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,529
Lampson, prepare two stretchers.

1011
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,489
One for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

1012
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,908
Prepare all your remaining doses
of the drug for travel.

1013
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,201
Yes, sir.

1014
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,335
You said the thing
hadn't stopped,

1015
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:19,003
it was still spreading.

1016
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,296
Why did you say that?

1017
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,424
I don't know.

1018
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:24,676
Could the girl have been deliberately
leading us away from London?

1019
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,971
Is it possible we didn't find
all of her victims?

1020
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,432
If we didn't find all
the victims,

1021
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,183
if there are others
besides the girl in the park.

1022
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,227
The thing would spread.

1023
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:37,689
And a chain reaction,
geometrically, until by now...

1024
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,608
[whispers]
Oh, Christ.

1025
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:18,271
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to get through to the S.R.C. in London?

1026
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:19,939
Just a moment, sir,
there's something coming through.

1027
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,777
It is the S.R.C., sir,
for you and Carlsen.

1028
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:28,531
Go ahead.

1029
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:31,743
[male on radio]
Caine, can you hear me?

1030
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,871
Fallada, speak up,
I can't hear you.

1031
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,999
The two males didn't die.

1032
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:41,753
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soldiers who shot them

1033
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,048
and transformed the soldiers bodies
into their own likenesses.

1034
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:47,425
That's the difference between them
and their victims.

1035
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,177
The victims can't leave
their bodies.

1036
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,471
Only the original three
can do that.

1037
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:52,972
But I've killed one of them.

1038
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:57,185
- One of which?
- One of the two male vampires.

1039
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,687
One of the transformed ones.

1040
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,689
How did you kill him,
Fallada, how?

1041
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,942
The old way, Carlsen.

1042
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:08,279
A leaded metal shaft,
penetrating not through the heart,

1043
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,200
but through the energy center
two inches below the heart.

1044
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:15,370
Not steel, but leaded iron.

1045
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:17,372
Right, Carlsen?

1046
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:20,124
Are you there, Carlsen?

1047
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:22,001
Yes.

1048
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:25,046
Carlsen, you too, Caine,

1049
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:28,800
it is my belief
that the vampires of legend

1050
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,636
came from creatures
such as these.

1051
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:35,056
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

1052
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,600
I know it sounds incredible.

1053
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,187
Do you hear me, Carlsen!

1054
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:45,608
It's more than a belief, Fallada...
it's true.

1055
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,528
They visited Earth before.

1056
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,115
What about
the other male, Fallada?

1057
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,867
He's free.

1058
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:56,369
You have the girl?

1059
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,537
Yes.

1060
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,998
We'll be with you
as soon as we can, hold on.

1061
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,207
We'll try.

1062
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,296
This came through
while you were talking, sir.

1063
01:22:06,297 --> 01:22:08,506
- What is it?
- A scrambled cryptogram.

1064
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,758
It's to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

1065
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,386
We're to proceed directly
to the Citadel at Whitehall.

1066
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,681
Caine--

1067
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,218
[yells]

1068
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,013
Lieutenant, the controls!

1069
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,775
[screams]

1070
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,112
[Carlsen]
We've lost her, she's gone.

1071
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,573
Where?

1072
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,492
Her body's in London.

1073
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,660
Where in London?

1074
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:23,831
Carlsen, you've got to tell me
what happened,

1075
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,708
what really happened
on the Churchill.

1076
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:31,005
It wasn't Rawlings who destroyed
the radio equipment.

1077
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,757
And the ship's tapes.

1078
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,009
It was me.

1079
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,052
Why?

1080
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:38,638
I didn't want the Churchill
to be able to reach Earth.

1081
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:42,392
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

1082
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:43,685
What did happen?

1083
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:47,355
I opened her sealed
animation case.

1084
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:52,110
Either I did it or she did it.

1085
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,613
I couldn't help myself.

1086
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,658
I've never experienced such--

1087
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:03,496
I was in love on a level
you've never known, Caine.

1088
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,962
It terrifies me.

1089
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,340
My memory plays tricks on me.

1090
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,929
She was calling me.

1091
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:24,976
Her power was...spiritual.

1092
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,592
She wanted me, Caine.

1093
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,724
It was more than spiritual.

1094
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,572
She took some of my energy.

1095
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:25,036
And she gave me
some of her energy.

1096
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,838
They must have been living off
of each other when we found them.

1097
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,008
There were only three
of them left.

1098
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:43,137
She killed all of my men.

1099
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:45,973
One by one.

1100
01:25:47,518 --> 01:25:49,060
But I survived.

1101
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,896
She wanted me to survive.

1102
01:25:53,107 --> 01:25:54,565
She chose me!

1103
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:58,319
Why, why!

1104
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,697
Carlsen, she's not human,
she's not a woman.

1105
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,366
She'll destroy you.

1106
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:07,411
She's destroyed worlds.

1107
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,747
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

1108
01:26:10,124 --> 01:26:12,083
A special bulletin
from the BBC.

1109
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:14,836
[male announcer]
It's obvious that tonight,

1110
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:18,214
London is on the brink of the worst
devastation since the blitz.

1111
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:19,465
From where I'm standing,

1112
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:23,553
I can see large areas of the city
burning out of control.

1113
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:26,848
And thousands of people are now
rampaging through the streets here

1114
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:30,184
in a frenzied last effort
to avoid the plague.

1115
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:32,895
Martial law has been enforced now
for three hours

1116
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,439
But for the moment,
it hasn't stemmed what is obviously...

1117
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,234
[clamoring]

1118
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,162
Yes, sir, we've been
expecting you.

1119
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,538
Thank you, carry on.

1120
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:34,540
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.

1121
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,209
- Higgins, around the other side.
- Right.

1122
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:38,211
[mixed voices]

1123
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,803
[male] Is everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?

1124
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:48,930
[male #2]
Yes, everything.

1125
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:50,765
[female]
Please take a seat, gentlemen.

1126
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:59,732
Sir, I have Colonel Caine
and Colonel Carlsen here for you, sir.

1127
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,609
Very good.

1128
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:04,403
The Prime Minister
will see you shortly.

1129
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,947
Uh, would you care for a cup of tea,
while you wait?

1130
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:08,407
No, our business is
rather urgent.

1131
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,952
Yes, I'm sure the Prime Minister
understands that.

1132
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,912
- Oh, uh, gentlemen?
- Prime Minister.

1133
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,664
I'm Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service,

1134
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:17,667
and I'm sure you've heard of
Colonel Carlsen, late of the Churchill.

1135
01:28:17,668 --> 01:28:21,545
Oh, ye-- yes, indeed, uh, gentlemen,
I look forward to hearing your report.

1136
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,589
By the way, uh,
where is Sir Percy?

1137
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,216
Dead, I'm afraid.

Oh, that's a great pity.

1139
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:31,430
Sir, we have information regarding
the object in space,

1140
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:32,974
which is bearing down on the Earth
at this moment--

1141
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:36,769
Ye-ye-yes, gentlemen, look, if you'll
excuse me just-- just for a moment.

1142
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,689
Mi-- Miss Haversham,
please come this way.

1143
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:42,775
Miss Haversham, here,
for a moment.

1144
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:44,652
I'll be back, gentlemen,
I'll be back.

1145

the doctor immediately.

1151
01:29:15,017 --> 01:29:16,600
Hey, what's happening
down there?

1152
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,438

Need a doctor over here.

1153
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,245

[yells]

1155
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,025
Lieutenant, do you have
any weapons aboard the craft?

1156
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:08,778
No, sir, uh,
there's a flare pistol, sir.

1157
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:09,820
Where is it?

1158
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,447
Just close the breach
and it's ready to fire.

1159
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:22,625
Sir, while you were with the PM,
I had a call from base operations.

1160
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,418
The city is now
under martial law.

1161
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,128
We've been placed
under NATO command.

1162
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,505
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.

1163
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,298
My unit's been mobilized
across the river

1164
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:30,758
to a staging area
at Blackheath.

1165
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:33,427
Land at the S.R.C., Lieutenant,
we've got to talk to Fallada.

1166
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,221
I've been ordered to land
at Blackheath, sir.

1167
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:37,556
The city's now
under air quarantine.

1168
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,642
If we don't do as they say,
they'll shoot us out of the air.

1169
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:49,235
Hello, zero, this is x-ray 3-1-8
requesting clearance to land-- over.

1170
01:30:49,236 --> 01:30:52,196
Zero roger, x-ray 3-1-8,
you are clear to land.

1171
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,083
Come away from the aircraft.

1172
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,501
You are under quarantine.

1173
01:31:07,421 --> 01:31:08,629
Over here, please, sir.

1174
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,633
Don't come any closer,
stop there!

1175
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,844
I want to talk
to your commanding officer.

1176
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:17,263
I am Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service.

1177
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:20,057
And this man
is Colonel Tom Carlsen,

1178
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:23,352
United States Air Force and former
commander of the Churchill.

1179
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,105
[male on PA]
C company, be on stand-by.

1180
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:30,568
Is Dr. Hans Fallada here
from the S.R.C.?

1181
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:32,403
He knows who we are
and what's going on.

1182
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:34,488
No, not that I know of.

1183
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,740
- Has anybody heard of him?
- No.

1184
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,117
Must still be in London.

1185
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:41,537
Colonel, what exactly do you know
about what's happening over there?

1186
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:43,247
All we know
for certain, Colonel,

1187
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:46,542
is that a terrible plague
of some sort is sweeping London.

1188
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,462
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

1189
01:31:49,463 --> 01:31:51,672
And until that time
has elapsed,

1190
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:54,049
I cannot release you
from this compound.

1191
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,926
Colonel, we know
what the plague is.

1192
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,344
We are not infected.

1193
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,222
I know what I'm talking about
and we're wasting valuable time.

1194
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:06,437
We have totally isolated London
in order to stop further contagion.

1195
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:10,149
If that fails and the surrounding
areas are threatened,

1196
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,150
Yes?

1197
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:16,322
sterilization by thermonuclear device
has been approved.

1198
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:19,950
We have this
from General Ames in Brussels.

1199
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:23,787
He's coming up
with that decision in... [sighs]

1200
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,956
just under three hours.

1201
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:27,750
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

1202
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:29,210
[female]
Corporal Adams...

1203
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:31,462
- The ship?
- The thing from Halley's Comet.

1204
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:34,173
Oh... [sighs]

1205
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:36,967
it's parked itself
in a geostationary orbit... [sighs]

1206
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,802
directly over London.

1207
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:54,401
[male on PA] Would air adjutant report
to Major Grover in GHQ.

1208
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:59,365
All those little blue lights going up
toward the clouds,

1209
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,576
they're human souls.

1210
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:05,579
How do you know that?

1211
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,039
I feel it.

1212
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:10,668
The process of conversion
releases a life energy.

1213
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:11,877
Then it can be collected.

1214
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:13,295
Collected?

1215
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,382
Is that what the umbrella is?

1216
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:18,592
Collector?

1217
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:21,095
The energy doesn't go free.

1218
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,596
It goes up there.

But he has to send it through her
to get it up to the collector.

1222
01:33:53,003 --> 01:33:54,712
Where is she, Carlsen?

1223
01:33:57,591 --> 01:33:59,508
Over there.

1224
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:01,468
I get flashes coming
from her body.

1225
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:04,346
Sensitive to its environment.

1226
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,807
Picks up things.

01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:08,475

Can you find her?

1228
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,394

1229

1230
01:34:13,023 --> 01:34:15,774
[Carlsen] He'll come
if he senses I've found her.

1231
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:17,568
She's drawing me, Caine.

[whispering]
Why?

1235
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:26,285
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

1236
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,749
When they take on
a new life form

1237
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:35,169
they have to learn
from that life form.

1238
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:38,005
Mate with it, in a sense.

1239
01:34:40,467 --> 01:34:42,217
The girl chose me.

1240
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:48,057
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herself.

1241
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,895
And now she wants
that part back.

1242
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:56,482
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector?

1243
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,359
- Over.
- No, sir.

1244
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,653
Okay, keep me posted-- over.

1245
01:35:00,654 --> 01:35:02,071
Colonel, listen to me.

1246
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:04,406
Carlsen believes
he can locate the source.

1247
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:06,033
There are only two carriers.

1248
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:09,662
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

1249
01:35:09,663 --> 01:35:11,705
But we only have
an hour and a half.

Where's Carlsen?

1254
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,383
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored Land Rover.

1255
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:24,760
Oh, bloody hell, did he say anything
about where he was going?

1256
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:27,096
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was?

1257
01:35:27,097 --> 01:35:29,473
Rogers told him, the next thing I knew,
I was on the ground, sir.

Right, whose is this car?

- What?
- You heard me.

01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:34,569
Dead.

1294
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:37,531
How?

1295
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:38,782
Like the rest.

1296
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,369
How did you survive?

1297
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:48,917
You're looking for Carlsen.

1298
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:51,628
Has he been here?

1299
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:54,506
No, perhaps he misled you.

1300
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:55,799
What do you know about it?

1301
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,467
I've been doing some more work.

1302
01:40:58,011 --> 01:40:59,302
Go on.

1303
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:00,554
I discovered

1304
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:04,933
there is life after death.

1305
01:41:04,934 --> 01:41:05,934
How do you know?

1306
01:41:06,728 --> 01:41:11,106
There is a certain
mental transference, telepathy,

1307
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:14,401
that occurs between the vampires
and their victims.

1308
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:18,739
Carlsen is after the girl.

1309
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:21,450
How did you know that?

1310
01:41:21,451 --> 01:41:23,160
Oh, I...

1311
01:41:24,871 --> 01:41:25,996
I seem to sense it.

1312
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:28,874
Where is she, Fallada?

1313
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,544
Don't you know?

1314
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:37,549
Carlsen knows.

1315
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:38,633
Where, Fallada?

1316
01:41:39,677 --> 01:41:41,428
She's in the cathedral.

1317
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:44,556
She's been there
since she escaped.

1318
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,809
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

1319
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:51,688
The crypt of kings
and queens.

1320
01:41:51,689 --> 01:41:52,731
Stay where you are.

1321
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:56,735
Stay where you are!

1322
01:42:04,786 --> 01:42:06,536
[laughs]

1323
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:15,128
Here I go.

1324
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:55,627
[explosion]

1325
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:06,805
[growling]

1326
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,499
I knew you would come,
Carlsen.

1327
01:44:18,878 --> 01:44:20,212
I'm here.

1328
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:23,381
Now can this madness end?

1329
01:44:24,217 --> 01:44:25,842
Come.

1330
01:44:26,928 --> 01:44:28,053
Be with me.

1331
01:44:29,347 --> 01:44:31,681
I need you.

1332
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,975
It was always intended

1333
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:38,021
you should find us
and bring us to Earth.

1334
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:49,115
The web of destiny carries
your blood and soul

1335
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:52,827
back to the genesis
of my life form.

1336
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:54,871
Come.

1337
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:57,666
Be with me.

1338
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:00,794
Come with me, Carlsen.

1339
01:45:22,984 --> 01:45:24,985
[clamoring]

1340
01:45:43,170 --> 01:46:16,661
[shrieking]

1341
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:16,573
It'll be much less terrifying
if you just come to me.

1342
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:23,663
I'll do just that.

1343
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:30,587
[yelling]

1344
01:48:52,985 --> 01:48:55,403
[screeching]

1345
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:48,831
Carlsen!

1346
01:49:51,544 --> 01:49:53,419
What are these feelings?

1347
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,964
Why do I feel so close to you?

1348
01:49:55,965 --> 01:49:57,340
Need you?

1349
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:58,675
Because you're one of us.

1350
01:50:00,261 --> 01:50:01,386
You always have been.

1351
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:03,137
You're like me.

1352
01:50:03,138 --> 01:50:04,597
Be with me.

1353
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:19,445
Just a little more.
Just a little more.

1354
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:47,890
Carlsen!

1355
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:03,281
Caine!

1356
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:14,334
[yelling]
