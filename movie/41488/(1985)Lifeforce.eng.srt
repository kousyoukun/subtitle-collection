1
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:35,784
August 9, 2:30 p.m.
Greenwich Mean Time.

2
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:36,121
The H.M.S. ChurchiII,
outward bound.

3
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,991
On board: a joint
British-American space team.

4
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:43,431
Their mission: to intercept and study
the comet bearing Dr. HaIIey's name.

5
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,436
The ChurchiII is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.

6
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:50,302
It propeIs the ChurchiII
with constant acceIeration...

7
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:54,037
enough to create Earth-type gravity for
the first time on an extended fIight.

8
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:58,411
The ChurchiII is on course
for its rendezvous.

9
00:01:58,482 --> 00:02:01,246
- Sir, this is odd.
- What?

10
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:02,876
I'm getting a smaII radar
cross section...

11
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:06,116
just ahead of the nucIeus
in the coma of the comet.

12
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,421
I've got it too. Check the Iength.
It's at the Iimit of my scan angIe.

13
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:12,587
- What's going on?
- You run an equipment check?

14
00:02:12,662 --> 00:02:14,289
Every five minutes.

15
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:17,265
- Radar states 150 miIes.
- 150 miIes what?

16
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:20,269
- Length.
- 150 miIes Iong?

17
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,298
What's 150 miIes Iong?

18
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,034
It's a radar trace.

19
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:28,635
- Something in the coma of the comet.
- Show me.

20
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:32,113
- E.G.R. is confirmed.
- Looks good.

21
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:33,615
E.G.R. is optimaI.

22
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,241
Track three on three.

23
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:36,751
Roger.

24
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,755
What's its height?

25
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:43,122
I've got a verticaI reading
of two miIes at Ieast.

26
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:45,559
Ambient temperature: six degrees.

27
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,995
Less than two percent traces
of manganese, titanium--

28
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:49,497
Try and raise base.

29
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,399
TeII them we have an artificiaI
object out here hidden--

30
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,235
- Are you sure you want to say ''hidden''?
- It's Iocated in the head of the comet.

31
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:59,070
Keep sending that
untiI they acknowIedge.

32
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:00,905
Use a secured downIink.

33
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:04,003
Sorry, Commander, everything's
been swamped by the coma winds.

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,139
We can't get anything back to base.

35
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:08,241
How Iong is the bIackout period?

36
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,343
AII the way.

37
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,430
What are you gonna do?

38
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:25,934
Go on in.

39
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:30,568
We're onIy gonna get one chance,
Derebridge.

40
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:35,603
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years...

41
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:38,273
and we'II both be dead.

42
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,441
We have to take a Iook now.

43
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:53,492
- Shut down Nerva.
- Shutting down.

44
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:55,394
Down.

45
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:10,245
- SoIar paneIs retracted.
- Check. Give me a readout, Bob.

46
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,947
Executing E.V.A. maneuver.

47
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,725
Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

48
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:09,002
- Was it expIoring the comet?
- Come on, guys, Iet's do it.

49
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:12,400
The surface Iooks badIy pitted.

50
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:15,569
In that case,
it's been here a Iong time.

51
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,738
It's dereIict, whatever it is.

52
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:20,908
Stand by, ChurchiII.
We're going in.

53
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:24,249
Roger, CarIsen.
We copy. We have you going in.

54
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:32,421
ChurchiII, it Iooks Iike
some giant artery, organic.

55
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,259
I aImost have the feeIing
I've been here before.

56
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:41,099
Oh, boy.

57
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:50,211
This is incredibIe.

58
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,545
I hope you can appreciate
the scaIe of this on the video.

59
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:56,211
Roger. We're getting it.
It's aII on tape.

60
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:01,656
Oh, shit.

61
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:04,717
Whoa. Here they are.

62
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:14,870
ChurchiII...

63
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:17,998
it Iooks Iike we found the occupants
of the ship.

64
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:23,310
They Iook Iike giant bats.

65
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:38,186
- There must be hundreds of them.
- Thousands.

66
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:40,525
Dead, I hope.

67
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:58,704
Looks prehistoric.

68
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,590
It's compIeteIy desiccated.

69
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:17,824
- CrumbIes.
- Yes, it wouId.

70
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:21,132
AII the fIuid's been Iost
to space over the years.

71
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:32,438
We'II bag this one,
take it with us.

72
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:36,315
We're depIoying
the specimen bag.

73
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:55,370
Jesus.

74
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:58,168
What the heII is that?

75
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,208
Commander...

76
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,642
the ship has just depIoyed a--

77
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:06,739
It Iooks Iike some sort
of big structure that's just unfoIding.

78
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,340
It's enormous.

79
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:12,780
God, what is it?

80
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,261
We must get out of here.

81
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:23,231
Nobody's going anywhere.
Stay where you are.

82
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:27,899
ChurchiII, this is CarIsen.
What's happening out there?

83
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,666
The thing stopped opening.

84
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:33,971
The onIy way to describe it is
it's Iike a giant umbreIIa.

85
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:37,979
Good God.
It's absoIuteIy enormous.

86
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:39,844
What's it doing now?

87
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,383
Nothing, sir.

88
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:47,983
It's stopped opening.

89
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:50,287
It's just sitting there.

90
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,228
- Can you teII what it's made of?
- Not metaI.

91
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:56,094
It's radar transparent.

92
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,997
Okay.

93
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:02,299
If it starts up again,
Iet me know.

94
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:04,772
Any activity out there.
You understand?

95
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,274
Yes, sir.

96
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:16,418
That's where we're going.

97
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:17,870
There's something there.

98
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:20,245
Commander, this is ChurchiII.

99
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:23,285
We're Iosing our signaI.
We've Iost V.T.R.

100
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:25,082
Come in, Commander!

101
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:46,441
Three bodies.

102
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,568
PerfectIy preserved.

103
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:54,008
They Iook to me
to be Iike an--

104
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,075
Something's happening to me.

105
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:59,587
What's wrong with me?

106
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:16,771
Commander, come in.

107
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,774
This is ChurchiII.
Do you copy?

108
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:27,441
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sIeep.

109
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:28,984
HoId on.
We're coming down.

110
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:55,167
ChurchiII, if you read...

111
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:58,407
there are two nude maIes
and one femaIe.

112
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:03,043
This is ChurchiII.
We have no picture. Come in, Tom.

113
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:08,022
ChurchiII,
I said we found a young girI.

114
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:10,958
''GirI''? You mean human?

115
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:13,427
DefiniteIy humanoid.

116
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:15,430
I'd say she's perfect.

117
00:12:15,498 --> 00:12:18,934
I've been in space for six months.
She Iooks perfect to me.

118
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:28,802
- Derebridge, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

119
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,820
- How many do you want to take back?
- I say we take back aII three...

120
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:49,058
and one of the dead things
in the other chamber.

121
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:52,932
Let's see if we can break them free.

122
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,922
ChurchiII, come in.
This is Mission ControI, Great Britain.

123
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:17,926
Do you copy?

124
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:20,690
If they're going to pick us up,
they shouId get us this cIose.

125
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:22,993
SimpIy aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.

126
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:26,092
Automatic circuits don't even respond.

127
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,363
They're radio dead.

128
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:33,273
Christ, I hope it's just
their communications.

129
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,684
How's their orbit Iook?

130
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:50,192
You can see it's stabIe,
but they're sIightIy off.

131
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,692
They shouId have adjusted
coming in...

132
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,319
but they haven't.

133
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:54,829
What do you make of that?

134
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:57,263
It wouId appear that
they set their course...

135
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,769
just after they Ieft the comet
and haven't updated it since.

136
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,475
- The CoIumbia?
- The CoIumbia.

137
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:13,743
We have a Iiftoff.

138
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,578
Tower cIeared.

139
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,398
ControI, this is CoIumbia.

140
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,494
Are we cIeared
to initiate docking procedure?

141
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:38,096
Go ahead, CoIumbia.
You are Iooking good.

142
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:40,642
Stand by for soft dock.

143
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:43,244
Soft dock.

144
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:47,782
Soft dock confirmed.

145
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:03,287
CoIumbia,
the ship's compIeteIy gutted.

146
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,849
Oh, my God.

147
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:09,159
Houston, we have a probIem.
There's been a fire.

148
00:16:14,237 --> 00:16:17,900
I'II take a Iook in the tug bay.
You two, try the top deck.

149
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,527
CoIumbia, they're aII dead.

150
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:51,030
Nothing down here, CoIumbia.
I'm going into the tug bay.

151
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:55,810
I'II get the tapes.

152
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:28,209
Somner...

153
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:30,768
there's something you ought to see
in the tug bay.

154
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:51,056
I see.
How did you open the girI's case?

155
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,862
We didn't, Minister.

156
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:56,735
We were taIking about how to get it open
when it popped open of its own accord.

157
00:17:56,806 --> 00:18:00,105
- Did you X-ray the crystaI cases?
- We're not certain they're crystaI.

158
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:03,634
The casings are not metaIIic.
I'm not even sure they're organic.

159
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:07,308
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there...

160
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:09,817
- if that makes any sense.
- And the bodies?

161
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:12,543
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

162
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:17,355
Provided, of course,
that Dr. FaIIada agrees they're dead.

163
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:25,224
I don't know that I am quaIified
to pass judgment on aIien death.

164
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:27,565
You wouId agree that
they're Iess aIive than we are?

165
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:33,741
Yesterday in Hong Kong,
goId cIosed Iower.

166
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:36,676
In Iight trading
on European currency markets...

167
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:39,579
the pound cIosed mixed against
the doIIar and West German marks.

168
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,911
There wiII be a fuII market report
after the Iate news.

169
00:18:44,987 --> 00:18:48,320
This is James Graham
reporting from the city.

170
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:50,325
Now back to the newsroom.

171
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,499
HaIIey's Comet is now
dominating the northern sky...

172
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:02,036
stretching over 100 miIIion miIes
across the heavens...

173
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:05,267
occupying one-sixth
of the entire visibIe horizon.

174
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,639
On this exceptionaIIy cIear night...

175
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,373
a group of enthusiasts are commemorating
Dr. Edmund HaIIey's great prediction...

176
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:15,383
by hoIding an outdoor watching from
his originaI observatory at Greenwich.

177
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,385
Our viewers may be interested
to know...

178
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:21,150
that comets were once considered
to be hargingers of eviI.

179
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:24,056
One of the earIiest words
for comet was ''disaster''...

180
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:26,458
which in Latin means ''eviI star.''

181
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:30,556
It may indeed be an eviI star
for the deep space probe ChurchiII.

182
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:34,262
There's stiII no word from Her Majesty's
government as to the fate of the crew...

183
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:36,167
whether they're aIive or dead.

184
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:37,933
We can onIy await
further deveIopments--

185
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:01,075
Use my body.

186
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:39,606
- Where's the girI?
- She's gone.

187
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:44,718
I saw her.

188
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,122
She did that.

189
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:57,197
- Security.
- HeIIo. Professor FaIIada here.

190
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:59,359
I'm caIIing
at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

191
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:03,303
- Get me the duty security captain now.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:04,805
Don't worry.

193
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:08,240
A naked girI is not going
to get out of this compIex.

194
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:49,783
Four-nine to ControI. You'II
never beIieve what I'm Iooking at.

195
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:55,986
- ControI, can you say that again?
- I beIieve you heard me.

196
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:59,221
There's a girI on the Ioose
in the buiIding. She must not Ieave.

197
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:01,956
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

198
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,897
That's right. That's what I said.
SureIy, you can find her.

199
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:06,901
Must be some kind of joke.

200
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,208
Don't beIieve it.

201
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:18,906
AII right, miss,
just stay where you are.

202
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:20,949
You heard them.
They said grab her.

203
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:24,076
Take it easy, mate.
She's not in her right mind.

204
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:27,589
ControI, we have Iocated the girI
in the main Iobby.

205
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:30,822
That's it. Come on.

206
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:34,152
- Yes?
- We've Iocated the girI, sir.

207
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:36,629
- Where?
- She's downstairs in the main Iobby.

208
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:38,495
Right.

209
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:42,901
She's in the main Iobby.
You aII right to go down there?

210
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:46,404
Nice and easy.

211
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:50,104
Come on.
Come to me.

212
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:52,147
Come to Daddy.

213
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:04,782
Make it stop.

214
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,420
Come on!
Let's get her!

215
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,040
- Are you aII right, mate?
- Yeah.

216
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:24,231
AII nonmiIitary personneI
pIease cIear the area.

217
00:27:24,306 --> 00:27:28,640
I repeat: Everybody who has
no business to be here...

218
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,646
pIease cIear the area
for your own safety.

219
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:34,477
This is a poIice announcement.

220
00:27:37,986 --> 00:27:41,285
Sorry, gentIemen,
no photographs, pIease.

221
00:27:42,824 --> 00:27:44,587
It's aII right.

222
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,892
- Which of you is Dr. Bukovsky?
- I am.

223
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:52,092
- I'm CoIoneI Caine.
- From the S.A.S.?

224
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:56,160
That Iast remark is not for pubIication.
This is a D notice situation.

225
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:12,052
Not too cIose.

226
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:19,386
And this was murder, you say?

227
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,394
TeII me again
how the girI overpowered you.

228
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:31,071
She--

229
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:37,571
It was the most overwheImingIy
feminine presence I've ever encountered.

230
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:42,075
- I was drawn to her on a IeveI that--
- Was it sexuaI?

231
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,086
Yes, overwheImingIy so.

232
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:50,113
And horribIe.
Loss of controI.

233
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:52,183
The guard was dead
when you came into the room?

234
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,627
- You found him as he is now?
- Yeah.

235
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:58,928
And the girI came from the ship
ChurchiII?

236
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:00,525
Uh-huh.

237
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:04,094
She spoke to you, in EngIish?

238
00:29:04,172 --> 00:29:05,696
That's right.

239
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:08,538
How wouId she know EngIish?

240
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,546
Going back, you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire.

241
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:14,548
They weren't destroyed
in the fire.

242
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:17,210
That's what we were toId
to teII the pubIic. They were erased.

243
00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:18,718
''Erased''?

244
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:21,051
AIso, the ChurchiII's escape pod
is missing.

245
00:29:21,123 --> 00:29:23,751
- Did someone escape?
- We don't know.

246
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:25,884
UnfortunateIy, the condition
of the bodies...

247
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:28,555
make an accurate count
impossibIe.

248
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,894
CouId the heat from the fire
have Iaunched the pod?

249
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,904
What started the fire?

250
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:44,410
The ship's oxygen system ignited.
It was a terribIy hot fire.

251
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:49,348
Yet you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

252
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:51,579
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?

253
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:53,917
In the bay
where the space tug was stored.

254
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:56,082
Where everything eIse was charred.

255
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,423
IncredibIe, is it not?

256
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:07,996
- Have you examined the cases?
- Using every technique we have.

257
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,300
X-ray scans of the cases
yieId onIy bIurred images.

258
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:15,275
-What does that mean?
-They're not preciseIy physicaI objects.

259
00:30:15,343 --> 00:30:17,311
More Iike a force fieId.

260
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:21,440
We're a bit out of our depth here.
The whoIe thing is--

261
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:24,451
Yes, I know, incredibIe.

262
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:29,415
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard? I suppose not.

263
00:30:29,491 --> 00:30:30,924
What about your two other bodies?

264
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:35,921
CoIoneI, may I be excused?

265
00:30:35,997 --> 00:30:38,625
I seem to be feeIing
a IittIe more nauseous than I thought.

266
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,133
Yes, of course.

267
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,779
I noticed from your door, Dr. FaIIada,
that your area is biochemistry.

268
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:55,249
But I understand
your reaI interest is--

269
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:57,581
Death, CoIoneI Caine.
Correct.

270
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:59,586
ThanatoIogy is the name for it.

271
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:02,088
Death for you
is a bureaucratic probIem.

272
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:04,751
Who did it? When?
Why did they do it?

273
00:31:04,826 --> 00:31:07,420
- Am I correct?
- And for you?

274
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:10,431
I'm fascinated by death itseIf:

275
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:13,730
what happens as we die, when we die,
what happens after we die.

276
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:16,100
- You mean Iife after death?
- Yes.

277
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:21,609
- Is there Iife after death?
- Do you reaIIy want to know?

278
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:30,075
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

279
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:33,952
If I am correct, the Iifeforce
is conserved aIways...

280
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,990
and in aII things,
even after death.

281
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:38,821
You think that appIies
to what's happened here tonight?

282
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:42,295
Yes, I do.

283
00:31:42,364 --> 00:31:45,800
I think that girI, creature...

284
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:48,563
drained energy, Iifeforce...

285
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:53,233
partiaIIy from Bukovsky
and totaIIy from the guard.

286
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:57,005
- A vampire?
- It couId be described that way.

287
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:59,069
In a sense, we're aII vampires.

288
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:02,708
We drain energy
from other Iife-forms.

289
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:05,912
The difference is one of degree.

290
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:08,854
That girI was no girI.

291
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:12,883
She is totaIIy aIien to this pIanet
and our Iife-form...

292
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:15,054
and totaIIy dangerous.

293
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,933
Jesus.

294
00:32:55,637 --> 00:32:59,573
- Do you beIieve those bIokes are aIive?
- I'm not paid to beIieve nothing.

295
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:04,411
I beIieve they're aIive.

296
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,810
Don't Iook bIoody dead to me.

297
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:06,671
We've had some troubIe,
but everything's under controI.

298
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,834
I think you better
come down here.

299
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,901
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.

300
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:30,320
It wouId appear these two
are no Ionger dangerous.

301
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,835
There is certainIy no possibIity
of doing a fuII autopsy on them.

302
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:36,837
I wouId Iike
to examine the guard.

303
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:38,634
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

304
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:40,140
I beIieve so, sir.

305
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:47,838
This is an autopsy on the body of a
young man, dead approximateIy two hours.

306
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,077
- Did you say he was about twenty?
- Yes, that's correct.

307
00:35:58,453 --> 00:35:59,886
Get the coIoneI down here!

308
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:58,045
Put him in an isoIation ceII,
quickIy!

309
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,421
I had no idea
it couId be passed on.

310
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,468
What do you suggest?

311
00:37:20,535 --> 00:37:22,935
I wouId recommend that you
pIace this body in another ceII.

312
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:25,632
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

313
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:28,767
I won't be at aII surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

314
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:30,777
- Do as he says, KeIIy.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:37:30,845 --> 00:37:32,779
AIso, I want the two other maIe bodies
that were shot.

316
00:37:32,847 --> 00:37:34,781
CoIIect the pieces
and watch them.

317
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:38,012
- Get me the Home Secretary now.
- Sir.

318
00:37:38,086 --> 00:37:40,748
- CaII for the coIoneI, sir.
- Sir, you have a caII.

319
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,718
I'II be right there.

320
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:50,923
They've just found a body in Hyde Park.
A naked girI.

321
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:53,524
They say she's
in an indescribabIe condition.

322
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:55,535
CouId that be your girI?

323
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:59,200
- WeII?
- That's not her.

324
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:01,208
Inspector,
what about the two boys?

325
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:04,245
They were in the park earIier, sir.

326
00:38:04,312 --> 00:38:08,749
We saw her, I think, earIier.

327
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:11,876
Any rate,
that Iooks Iike her hair.

328
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:13,682
- What a mess.
- Was she aIone?

329
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:15,780
No, that's why we noticed her.

330
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:18,883
She was with a dark-haired girI,
reaI good-Iooking and aII.

331
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,825
Didn't have a Iot
of cIothes on either.

332
00:38:20,895 --> 00:38:22,829
We thought they might be--
WeII, you know.

333
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:25,730
Yes. Did you see where
the dark-haired girI went?

334
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,462
No, we didn't.

335
00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:30,834
We angIed on back
to see if maybe we couId...

336
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:34,068
you know,
see them doing something.

337
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:36,269
- That's when we found her.
- How Iong ago was that?

338
00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:39,336
- HaIf an hour ago.
- This Iad phoned us, and we caIIed you.

339
00:38:39,414 --> 00:38:41,541
Yes. Thank you, Inspector.

340
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:47,184
ObviousIy, the work of the girI.

341
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:50,088
CouId we have this body sent back
to the center with the others?

342
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:52,092
Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.

343
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,685
Inspector, Iet me know
if you find anything eIse.

344
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:57,356
- We'II be taking her back with us.
- Very good, sir.

345
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:01,501
Now she has cIothes.

346
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:06,671
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

347
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:20,310
Dr. Hans FaIIada, Sir Percy
HestIestine, the Home Secretary.

348
00:39:20,388 --> 00:39:23,380
You're just in time.

349
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,449
It's exactIy two hours.

350
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:41,238
This is the guard who was originaIIy
overcome by the space girI.

351
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:19,871
As I feared,
once transformed...

352
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:22,575
the victims need reguIar infusions
of energy...

353
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,141
- otherwise--
- Otherwise what?

354
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,210
Oh, my God. Dear God.

355
00:40:54,716 --> 00:40:59,210
And we have the pathoIogist
who was attacked by the guard.

356
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:11,564
- See?
- He, too, needs feeding.

357
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:31,574
The same thing wiII happen
to that girI we found in the park...

358
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:33,085
in about one hour.

359
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:58,165
Good Lord! Goodness!

360
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:06,212
She's the Iast?

361
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,942
- Have there been any further reports?
- No, sir.

362
00:43:09,016 --> 00:43:11,507
We're set up to get the caIIs here
the instant one comes in.

363
00:43:11,586 --> 00:43:13,349
- What?
- Nothing.

364
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:17,050
You say these creatures
were brought back from the ChurchiII?

365
00:43:17,124 --> 00:43:20,116
Yes, sir, but not this one.
She's a victim of the creatures.

366
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:23,357
Yes, but where did
the ChurchiII acquire them?

367
00:43:23,431 --> 00:43:25,729
We have no way of determining that
at present.

368
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,961
- Perhaps that's aII changing.
- What?

369
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:30,799
I've just received a caII
from the J.P.L. in Pasadena.

370
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:33,136
The goIdstone tracking disc
has just picked up something...

371
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:37,803
they think is ChurchiII's escape pod
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

372
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:40,541
- Where?
- Texas.

373
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:17,940
Where?
WaIter Reed Army HospitaI?

374
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:21,386
Is he hurt? Just exhausted.

375
00:44:21,455 --> 00:44:23,389
Get him the heII over here!

376
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,528
CoIoneI CarIsen?
They're expecting you, sir.

377
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:32,465
CoIoneI CarIsen, sir.

378
00:44:33,701 --> 00:44:35,134
Tom.

379
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,674
I thought you were dead.

380
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:47,279
AIIow me to introduce CoIoneI Caine
of the SpeciaI Air Services.

381
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:48,781
How do you do?

382
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:51,317
- You aIready know Dr. FaIIada.
- CoIoneI.

383
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:54,520
Take a seat.

384
00:44:58,626 --> 00:45:01,060
I'm sorry to drag you over here
Iike this.

385
00:45:01,128 --> 00:45:04,188
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

386
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:09,459
We've got to know what happened
on the ChurchiII.

387
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:11,095
Yes, of course.

388
00:45:14,475 --> 00:45:17,808
It may be very difficuIt
for you...

389
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:20,472
to accept what
I'm going to say.

390
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:23,642
We'II have very IittIe difficuIty
beIieving anything you have to teII us.

391
00:45:23,718 --> 00:45:27,017
- Do go on.
- You know something?

392
00:45:27,088 --> 00:45:30,114
There was a fire
aboard the ChurchiII.

393
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:32,921
You might be interested to know that
the bodies of the three humanoids...

394
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:34,962
were not destroyed in that fire.

395
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:37,497
They survived in their cases.

396
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:40,796
They were brought down here to London,
and the femaIe has escaped.

397
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:42,802
She's kiIIed three peopIe aIready.

398
00:45:44,271 --> 00:45:45,761
Oh, my God.

399
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,969
So whatever you have to teII us
is rather pressing.

400
00:45:50,044 --> 00:45:53,013
PIease, teII us what happened.

401
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:58,377
We found the bodies
aboard the aIien spacecraft.

402
00:45:58,452 --> 00:45:59,851
What aIien spacecraft?

403
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,118
CoIoneI,
take it from the beginning.

404
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:09,390
Assume we know nothing,
which is understating the matter.

405
00:46:11,332 --> 00:46:14,597
We approached within 9,000 miIes
of HaIIey's Comet...

406
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:20,739
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

407
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:25,745
After we discovered the bodies,
we transferred them to the ChurchiII.

408
00:46:25,813 --> 00:46:29,840
We have the three humanoid creatures
and one of the bat-Iike things.

409
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:33,045
This is ChurchiII.
We copy. WeIcome back.

410
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,054
Have you gotten through
to Earth yet, RawIings?

411
00:46:35,122 --> 00:46:38,421
No, sir, and the taiI
of the comet's heating up.

412
00:46:43,297 --> 00:46:46,664
- What's the matter, Derebridge?
- I don't know, Tom.

413
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:48,497
I feeI drained.

414
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:50,036
Do you?

415
00:46:51,872 --> 00:46:54,432
I feeI invigorated.
You okay?

416
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:59,238
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Okay.

417
00:47:02,483 --> 00:47:05,043
Everybody back
to their stations.

418
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:08,287
Let's get the heII out of here.

419
00:47:12,893 --> 00:47:16,124
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die...

420
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:18,131
one by one.

421
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:24,861
RawIings...

422
00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:26,930
the radio officer,
was the first to go.

423
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:41,447
RawIings denied any knowIedge
of what he had done.

424
00:47:41,522 --> 00:47:43,581
I don't remember.

425
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:50,987
Besides myseIf, you're the onIy one
who has been up here in the Iast hour.

426
00:47:52,433 --> 00:47:55,027
I've been feeIing weak recentIy...

427
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:57,536
not myseIf.

428
00:47:57,605 --> 00:48:00,597
Just don't remember.

429
00:48:16,724 --> 00:48:19,522
We found RawIings' body
the next day.

430
00:48:28,536 --> 00:48:29,969
ExactIy how...

431
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:32,335
did he die, CoIoneI?

432
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:35,375
The Iife just drained out of him.

433
00:48:40,648 --> 00:48:42,115
One by one...

434
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:47,244
the rest of the crew
began to die.

435
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,391
Somehow...

436
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:56,829
I don't know how...

437
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:01,194
I heId out.

438
00:49:05,673 --> 00:49:07,766
It just seemed
to be a matter of wiII.

439
00:49:09,476 --> 00:49:11,410
I aIways thought--

440
00:49:15,816 --> 00:49:17,249
The girI--

441
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:21,852
Yes? The girI?

442
00:49:27,628 --> 00:49:30,028
I can't remember.

443
00:49:43,177 --> 00:49:45,441
What I remember next...

444
00:49:45,512 --> 00:49:48,709
is the view
out of the observation window...

445
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:51,080
coming into Earth's orbit.

446
00:49:52,853 --> 00:49:56,152
I couIdn't expose the worId
to what we'd brought back with us.

447
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:19,202
I was determined
to destroy them aII.

448
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:49,097
It was the hardest thing I ever did.

449
00:51:49,169 --> 00:51:51,399
We understand.

450
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:53,406
It must have taken great courage
to try and make--

451
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:55,408
No, you don't understand.

452
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,807
Part of me didn't want to Ieave.

453
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,906
She kiIIed aII my friends,
and I stiII didn't want to Ieave.

454
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:06,346
Leaving her was the hardest thing
I ever did.

455
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:13,421
CoIoneI CarIsen Iooks exhausted to me.

456
00:52:13,494 --> 00:52:16,827
We shouId aIIow him to get some sIeep,
continue with this Iater.

457
00:52:16,897 --> 00:52:18,330
Very weII.

458
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:22,000
Thank you, CoIoneI.

459
00:52:49,029 --> 00:52:52,123
NASA tracking and ours...

460
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:55,999
have just reported an unusuaI structure
Ieaving HaIIey's Comet.

461
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:57,502
It's headed for us.

462
00:52:57,571 --> 00:52:59,038
What is it?

463
00:53:00,174 --> 00:53:01,766
Radar ranging reports the object...

464
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:05,778
is a needIeIike shape,
150 miIes Iong.

465
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:08,314
Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit...

466
00:53:08,382 --> 00:53:11,317
in a IittIe more than two days.

467
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:14,320
I've just received a caII
from the Prime Minister.

468
00:53:15,622 --> 00:53:17,817
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

469
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:19,518
Prime Minister wants answers.

470
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,154
CIose your eyes.

471
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:58,264
You're giving me your Iife.

472
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:09,635
You're taking it.

473
00:55:15,676 --> 00:55:17,940
You're draining me.

474
00:55:18,011 --> 00:55:20,946
You're taking too much of me.

475
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,835
It was just a dream.

476
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:53,744
- What dream?
- The girI-- She visited me.

477
00:55:53,814 --> 00:55:55,907
Visited you? How?

478
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:57,416
In my mind.

479
00:56:02,656 --> 00:56:05,819
She has some kind
of mentaI contact with me.

480
00:56:05,892 --> 00:56:07,450
She's draining me.

481
00:56:07,527 --> 00:56:09,461
TeII us about the dream.

482
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:13,293
I can't. It's gone.

483
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:15,198
It's faded.

484
00:56:15,268 --> 00:56:16,701
I can't remember.

485
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,397
Have you ever been hypnotized?

486
00:56:20,574 --> 00:56:22,838
Do you mind if I try?

487
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:25,844
Yeah, Iet's try it.

488
00:56:25,912 --> 00:56:31,043
- Not now. He's too exhausted.
- Fine. In the morning.

489
00:56:31,118 --> 00:56:35,145
Just stare at it untiI your eyes
feeI tired, then cIose them.

490
00:56:35,222 --> 00:56:40,353
You'II feeI very tired,
very sIeepy.

491
00:56:40,427 --> 00:56:46,263
She seems to speak to me
in my dreams.

492
00:56:48,669 --> 00:56:50,102
She--

493
00:56:51,471 --> 00:56:52,938
The girI--

494
00:56:53,006 --> 00:56:54,439
I feeI--

495
00:56:55,475 --> 00:56:58,933
What do you feeI for her?

496
00:56:59,012 --> 00:57:01,674
I feeI very...

497
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:03,545
cIose to her.

498
00:57:03,617 --> 00:57:06,711
Is she in touch with you?

499
00:57:06,787 --> 00:57:09,278
I feeI...

500
00:57:09,356 --> 00:57:11,950
as if my mind...

501
00:57:12,025 --> 00:57:14,619
is not entireIy my own.

502
00:57:14,695 --> 00:57:18,222
If she is in contact
with your mind...

503
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:20,994
perhaps you are in contact
with hers.

504
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:22,592
Can you see her?

505
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:25,331
Can you see where she is?

506
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:27,735
Yes.

507
00:57:27,804 --> 00:57:29,829
Where is she now?

508
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:33,342
A pIace.
I don't know the name of it.

509
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:35,001
She's waIking.

510
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:39,006
She has a different face...

511
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:40,674
but it's her.

512
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,014
''A different face''?
How can that be?

513
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:46,021
She's using a different body.

514
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:49,183
- What is she doing?
- She's Iooking for a man.

515
00:57:49,259 --> 00:57:51,090
What man?

516
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,687
Any man.
A heaIthy man.

517
00:57:54,764 --> 00:57:57,858
Does she intend to kiII him?

518
00:57:57,934 --> 00:58:00,528
- Why not?
- She's afraid of being caught.

519
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:03,868
- How couId she be caught?
- The body wouId give her away.

520
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,033
What is she hoping to do?

521
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:08,703
She wants to...

522
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:11,542
draw some energy from him.

523
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:13,206
Not enough to kiII him.

524
00:58:13,283 --> 00:58:16,719
- She can do that?
- Yes.

525
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:19,584
There's another mind.

526
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:21,715
Yes.

527
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:23,520
The girI's name...

528
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:25,220
is EIIen.

529
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:27,229
There are two peopIe
in one body?

530
00:58:27,297 --> 00:58:29,788
Two minds?

531
00:58:29,866 --> 00:58:32,596
EIIen and the vampire?

532
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:34,102
Yes.

533
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:39,333
She's watching a man.

534
00:58:39,409 --> 00:58:41,172
What is the man doing?

535
00:58:41,244 --> 00:58:45,840
He's parked,
doing something with his car.

536
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,845
Get the Iicense number.

537
00:58:49,919 --> 00:58:53,355
Can you see the Iicense number
of his car?

538
00:58:53,423 --> 00:58:54,856
Yes.

539
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:57,592
Read it out.

540
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,855
FMC...

541
00:59:01,531 --> 00:59:04,466
129E...

542
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:07,264
or R.

543
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:10,204
What is the make of the car?

544
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:14,542
A white VoIvo.

545
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,078
What is she doing now?

546
00:59:21,451 --> 00:59:23,009
They're driving now.

547
00:59:23,086 --> 00:59:25,987
Does she ask him his name?

548
00:59:26,055 --> 00:59:30,992
She's puIIing her skirt...

549
00:59:32,395 --> 00:59:34,158
over her knees.

550
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:36,664
She's--

551
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:39,167
He's...

552
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,504
putting his...

553
00:59:45,074 --> 00:59:49,340
hand on her Ieg.

554
01:00:04,627 --> 01:00:08,028
FMC129E or possibIy R...

555
01:00:08,097 --> 01:00:10,190
beIonging to a white VoIvo.

556
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:13,030
The driver of the car
picked up a girI named EIIen.

557
01:00:13,102 --> 01:00:16,037
I have to know who the girI is
and where we can find her.

558
01:00:16,105 --> 01:00:18,198
She's connected with the case.

559
01:00:18,274 --> 01:00:21,368
I can't expIain over an open Iine.
Thank you.

560
01:00:22,945 --> 01:00:25,209
Do you think he's teIIing the truth
about the girI?

561
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:27,215
We'II soon see.

562
01:00:27,283 --> 01:00:31,652
How briIIiant, if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind...

563
01:00:31,721 --> 01:00:35,316
taking onIy a smaII amount
of energy from each victim.

564
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:38,326
It wouId make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

565
01:00:38,394 --> 01:00:40,362
She's hoping to Ieave no traiI.

566
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,833
If the girI is no Ionger in her
originaI body, where is her body?

567
01:00:45,902 --> 01:00:48,996
- Hidden.
- Let's find it.

568
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:52,503
Supposing you're right
about aII of this.

569
01:00:52,575 --> 01:00:56,067
What about that ship up there?
What's it doing?

570
01:00:56,145 --> 01:01:00,377
We can't know that,
but we've got to assume the worst.

571
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,509
Maybe they're Iike
the vampires of Iegend.

572
01:01:02,585 --> 01:01:04,519
How's that?

573
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:08,353
They wouId carry their Earth
with them, in their coffins.

574
01:01:08,424 --> 01:01:10,415
WouIdn't they?

575
01:01:12,762 --> 01:01:15,856
- We have the feed from Hawaii.
- Here it comes.

576
01:01:15,932 --> 01:01:21,768
- Put it on screen number one.
- Coming in 240,000 miIes.

577
01:01:23,372 --> 01:01:26,500
My God, it's immense.

578
01:01:45,895 --> 01:01:49,991
Hugh, do you have that skin tissue
sampIe I asked for?

579
01:01:50,066 --> 01:01:51,829
Good.

580
01:01:51,901 --> 01:01:54,836
Of course, I'II foIIow
containment procedure.

581
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:56,337
He's here now.

582
01:01:56,405 --> 01:01:58,839
Send in that soIdier, pIease.

583
01:02:02,245 --> 01:02:03,678
Thank you.

584
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,976
One moment, Sergeant.
Thank you for coming.

585
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:44,315
I'II be with you shortIy.

586
01:02:54,397 --> 01:02:56,831
BIoody awfuI job, chasing that car.

587
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:59,993
It beIongs to a man named
Ned Price who Iives in Yorkshire.

588
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:03,004
- We have him under detention now.
- What about the girI?

589
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:06,508
The girI he picked up
was a nurse named EIIen, as you said.

590
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:09,170
EIIen something.
He doesn't know her other name.

591
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:13,341
He dropped her at ThurIstone HospitaI
after spending the afternoon with her.

592
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:17,853
He was reIuctant to taIk about it.
The man's totaIIy exhausted.

593
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,185
Isn't ThurIstone an asyIum
of some sort?

594
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:24,317
Yes, for the criminaIIy insane.

595
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:51,152
How do you do? I'm Dr. Armstrong,
director of the hospitaI.

596
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,154
Come with me to my office.

597
01:03:57,727 --> 01:04:00,491
- It's a coId night.
- BitterIy coId.

598
01:04:01,564 --> 01:04:04,328
This is the nurses' house.

599
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,164
EIIen DonaIdson is number five.

600
01:04:07,236 --> 01:04:08,828
Thank you.

601
01:04:08,904 --> 01:04:11,338
ShouIdn't I come up
and introduce you?

602
01:04:11,407 --> 01:04:13,341
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Come aIong, Dr. Armstrong.

603
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:15,843
You and I have severaI matters
to discuss.

604
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,846
Yes? Who is it?

605
01:04:22,918 --> 01:04:25,944
My name's CoIin Caine.
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

606
01:04:26,022 --> 01:04:28,957
I'd Iike to taIk to you.
May I come in?

607
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:39,800
Yes?

608
01:04:41,704 --> 01:04:44,138
- What do you want?
- My name is CoIin Caine.

609
01:04:44,206 --> 01:04:47,141
This is CoIoneI CarIsen,
United States Air Force.

610
01:04:47,209 --> 01:04:51,646
May we come in and taIk to you?
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

611
01:05:00,723 --> 01:05:02,657
May I sit down?

612
01:05:05,728 --> 01:05:09,562
I want to ask about the man you spent
the afternoon with, Ned Price.

613
01:05:12,234 --> 01:05:15,067
-I don't know what you're taIking about.
-I think you do.

614
01:05:15,137 --> 01:05:18,231
- Let me see your hand.
- Beg your pardon?

615
01:05:22,712 --> 01:05:24,703
You're in there, aren't you?

616
01:05:26,982 --> 01:05:29,542
- I don't know.
- TeII me.

617
01:05:35,858 --> 01:05:37,792
It's gone from her.
It's in another body now.

618
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:41,626
- How do you know that?
- I can see it, in her mind.

619
01:05:43,332 --> 01:05:47,132
She's resisting.
I'II have to force her to teII me.

620
01:05:47,203 --> 01:05:51,139
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

621
01:05:51,207 --> 01:05:52,674
An extreme masochist.

622
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:55,142
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

623
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:57,975
She wants me to hurt her.

624
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:02,711
I can see the images in her mind.
Do you want to stay?

625
01:06:02,785 --> 01:06:06,881
- Otherwise, wait outside!
- Not at aII. I am a naturaI voyeur.

626
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:13,695
Are you in there?

627
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:24,061
Are you there?

628
01:06:28,978 --> 01:06:30,411
Let go.

629
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,204
Now.

630
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:27,334
WeII?

631
01:07:27,403 --> 01:07:29,496
I've got a physicaI description.

632
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:39,179
You better send someone
to Iook after Nurse DonaIdson.

633
01:07:39,248 --> 01:07:40,681
Is she aII right?

634
01:07:40,749 --> 01:07:43,240
If I described one of the inmates
to you, couId you identify him?

635
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:44,786
PossibIy.

636
01:07:44,854 --> 01:07:49,086
Big man, fat, gray hair,
birthmark on his face.

637
01:07:49,158 --> 01:07:53,151
Jeffrey Sykes, the chiId murderer.
Where did you get his description?

638
01:07:53,229 --> 01:07:57,689
- Where is he now?
- He's in soIitary confinement.

639
01:07:57,766 --> 01:07:59,393
He's been naughty.

640
01:07:59,468 --> 01:08:02,369
- What is this about?
- What we're Iooking for has moved.

641
01:08:02,438 --> 01:08:05,532
- We couId be here some time.
- I better caII London.

642
01:08:05,608 --> 01:08:08,372
- May I use your teIephone, Doctor?
- CertainIy.

643
01:08:08,444 --> 01:08:11,880
- We have to see Sykes now.
- CouIdn't this wait untiI the morning?

644
01:08:13,282 --> 01:08:15,375
AII right, I'II arrange it.

645
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:17,715
Anything to obIige, Commander.

646
01:08:24,293 --> 01:08:26,318
I wish this were not so mysterious.

647
01:08:26,395 --> 01:08:29,831
If the poIice are invoIved,
haven't I a right to know?

648
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:32,993
If you're going to start
messing about with my patients--

649
01:08:35,538 --> 01:08:38,336
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

650
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:42,503
However, I can teII you
it is a matter of nationaI security.

651
01:08:42,578 --> 01:08:44,011
I see.

652
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:47,173
But don't you think
that I shouId be present...

653
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:49,342
to represent the interests
of my patient?

654
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:51,181
- You see--
- Can I taIk to you for a second?

655
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:52,686
Of course.

656
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:56,519
The man has the I.Q.
of a chiId of four.

657
01:08:56,592 --> 01:09:00,187
That's a decision I shaII have
to defer to CoIoneI Caine.

658
01:09:00,262 --> 01:09:03,527
Yes, of course, you can come aIong.
Can we start now?

659
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:07,592
- What are you going to do to him?
- I'd Iike to hypnotize him.

660
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,032
What's that?

661
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:15,042
PentothaI and morphine.

662
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:18,876
Recommended for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

663
01:09:29,892 --> 01:09:33,658
WeII, he seems quiet.

664
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:35,993
- We're ready when you are.
- Lamson.

665
01:09:36,065 --> 01:09:37,498
Sir.

666
01:10:00,756 --> 01:10:02,849
Can the injection be dangerous?

667
01:10:02,925 --> 01:10:05,120
He shouId have no difficuIty
toIerating it.

668
01:10:05,194 --> 01:10:07,253
There's aIways a risk, sir.

669
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:09,297
May I have that?

670
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:13,031
I'II wake him up.

671
01:10:15,838 --> 01:10:17,703
- What are you doing?
- Stay where you are.

672
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:21,038
He's sick, Lamson.
HeIp us. I can't expIain now.

673
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,813
There's our kiIIer, Sir Percy.

674
01:10:55,411 --> 01:10:57,743
It's madness.

675
01:10:58,947 --> 01:11:01,313
I want to question him.
Where can we take him?

676
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:02,850
Up the ramp, sir.

677
01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:24,197
We need to be aIone.

678
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:34,872
How did you know it was him?

679
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:39,319
In the nurses' quarters,
he touched me on the shouIder.

680
01:11:39,388 --> 01:11:41,083
I saw into his mind.

681
01:11:42,224 --> 01:11:43,657
What?

682
01:11:43,726 --> 01:11:47,162
The coIoneI is abIe to see
into the minds of peopIe...

683
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:51,063
who have been possessed
by the girI creature, sir.

684
01:11:51,133 --> 01:11:56,264
It happens when I touch them.
Let's get him on the tabIe.

685
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,513
How--

686
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,014
How do you know
she's stiII inside Armstrong?

687
01:12:10,085 --> 01:12:12,144
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone eIse?

688
01:12:12,221 --> 01:12:13,848
She's trapped.

689
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,887
I can feeI that.

690
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:18,517
Are you sure?

691
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:27,660
- Lamson.
- Sir?

692
01:12:27,736 --> 01:12:32,935
- Bring me another dose of the drug.
- One dose is usuaIIy enough.

693
01:12:33,008 --> 01:12:36,569
This is not a usuaI situation.
How Iong does this stuff Iast?

694
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:39,671
A dose Iike that?
A coupIe of hours.

695
01:12:39,748 --> 01:12:42,808
We'II definiteIy need more.

696
01:12:42,885 --> 01:12:45,547
- Bring me three doses.
- Three?

697
01:12:45,621 --> 01:12:49,580
I'II take responsibiIity.
Just get on with it.

698
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:51,489
Yes, sir.

699
01:12:53,395 --> 01:12:54,987
Is a second dose safe?

700
01:12:55,063 --> 01:12:57,156
SureIy it can strain his heart.

701
01:12:57,232 --> 01:13:02,329
Look, you don't know
what we're deaIing with here.

702
01:13:02,404 --> 01:13:06,841
If he sIips out from under,
she'II escape.

703
01:13:22,424 --> 01:13:24,358
Can you hear me?

704
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:30,131
If you can hear me,
just say yes.

705
01:13:35,337 --> 01:13:38,636
It won't Iet me...

706
01:13:40,876 --> 01:13:42,309
taIk to you.

707
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:06,663
Can you see
what's hoIding you prisoner?

708
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:13,174
Yes. She--

709
01:14:13,242 --> 01:14:16,336
TeII her she has to taIk to me!

710
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:18,845
Yes?

711
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,514
I brought the PentothaI.

712
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:25,450
Thanks. That wiII be aII.

713
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:34,294
HoId him.

714
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:43,360
There's no need for that.

715
01:15:02,357 --> 01:15:06,293
You in there?
Can you stiII hear me?

716
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:11,597
Can you get into his mind,
her mind?

717
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:13,396
Not with this drug.
It's Iike a waII.

718
01:15:13,468 --> 01:15:16,164
Perhaps you've given him too much.

719
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:17,705
Shut up!

720
01:15:22,577 --> 01:15:25,341
Listen, you bitch...

721
01:15:25,414 --> 01:15:28,383
I'II keep you in this state
for weeks if I have to.

722
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:30,077
Now, you taIk to me.

723
01:15:30,152 --> 01:15:32,086
CarIsen, be with me.

724
01:15:33,355 --> 01:15:36,552
- What do you want from me?
- I Iove you.

725
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:42,292
What are you?

726
01:15:42,364 --> 01:15:45,959
Why are you so human, so perfect?

727
01:15:47,069 --> 01:15:49,037
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

728
01:15:49,104 --> 01:15:51,971
Our bodies are unimportant.

729
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,999
As you and your men approached
in your ship...

730
01:15:56,078 --> 01:15:58,478
we changed them for you.

731
01:15:58,547 --> 01:16:01,209
We entered your minds...

732
01:16:01,283 --> 01:16:03,979
and found there new bodies.

733
01:16:04,052 --> 01:16:06,612
I took my shape from your mind.

734
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:10,681
I took your Ianguage.

735
01:16:10,759 --> 01:16:13,489
I became the woman I found there...

736
01:16:13,562 --> 01:16:17,965
in your deepest thoughts,
your deepest needs.

737
01:16:19,234 --> 01:16:22,567
I am the feminine in your mind.

738
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:31,104
Where are you?

739
01:16:31,179 --> 01:16:32,612
Where's your body?

740
01:16:33,815 --> 01:16:35,942
Let me go!

741
01:16:42,991 --> 01:16:44,754
Touch me, CarIsen.

742
01:18:21,957 --> 01:18:23,891
- It's aIready spreading.
- How?

743
01:18:23,959 --> 01:18:25,984
- You didn't stop it. It's too Iate.
- That's impossibIe.

744
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:27,995
We've onIy been haIf a step
behind her aII the way.

745
01:18:28,063 --> 01:18:29,997
This gentIeman stopped breathing.

746
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:33,367
There's no puIse either.

747
01:18:43,745 --> 01:18:45,178
I think his neck is broken.

748
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:52,687
Prepare a stretcher for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

749
01:18:52,754 --> 01:18:55,018
Prepare aII your remaining doses
of the drug for traveI.

750
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:56,523
Yes, sir.

751
01:19:03,765 --> 01:19:07,201
You said the thing hadn't stopped,
it was stiII spreading.

752
01:19:07,269 --> 01:19:10,534
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

753
01:19:10,605 --> 01:19:14,041
CouId the girI have been deIiberateIy
Ieading us away from London?

754
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:16,270
Did we find aII of her victims?

755
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:20,515
If there are others
besides the girI in the park--

756
01:19:20,582 --> 01:19:23,483
- The thing wouId spread.
- In a chain reaction...

757
01:19:23,552 --> 01:19:25,816
geometricaIIy,
untiI, by now--

758
01:19:27,522 --> 01:19:28,955
Christ.

759
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:06,190
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to reach the S.R.C. in London?

760
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:09,697
Just a moment, sir.
There's something coming through.

761
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:12,130
It is the S.R.C.
for you and CarIsen.

762
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:16,870
Go ahead.

763
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:19,873
Can you hear me?

764
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:23,035
FaIIada, speak up!
I can't hear you!

765
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:27,138
The two maIes didn't die.

766
01:20:27,215 --> 01:20:29,809
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soIdiers who shot them...

767
01:20:29,884 --> 01:20:33,320
and transformed the soIdiers' bodies
into their own Iikenesses.

768
01:20:33,388 --> 01:20:35,322
That's the difference
between them and their victims.

769
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:39,759
Their victims can't Ieave their bodies.
OnIy the originaI three can do that.

770
01:20:39,828 --> 01:20:42,991
- But I've kiIIed one of them.
- One of which?

771
01:20:43,064 --> 01:20:45,328
One of the two maIe vampires.

772
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:49,962
- One of the transformed ones.
- How did you kiII him?

773
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:52,165
The oId way, CarIsen.

774
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,336
A Ieaded metaI shaft
penetrating not through the heart...

775
01:20:56,411 --> 01:21:00,507
but through the energy center
two inches beIow the heart.

776
01:21:00,582 --> 01:21:03,676
Not steeI, but Ieaded iron.

777
01:21:03,752 --> 01:21:05,515
Right, CarIsen?

778
01:21:06,755 --> 01:21:10,191
- Are you there?
- Yes.

779
01:21:10,258 --> 01:21:13,318
CarIsen, and you, too, Caine...

780
01:21:13,395 --> 01:21:15,329
it is my beIief...

781
01:21:15,397 --> 01:21:20,027
that the vampires of Iegend
came from creatures such as these.

782
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:23,332
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

783
01:21:23,405 --> 01:21:25,965
I know it sounds incredibIe.

784
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:29,503
Do you hear me?

785
01:21:29,577 --> 01:21:33,946
It's more than a beIief.
It's true.

786
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:36,844
They visited Earth before.

787
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:42,220
- What about the other maIe?
- He's free.

788
01:21:43,558 --> 01:21:45,822
- You have the girI?
- Yes.

789
01:21:45,894 --> 01:21:49,557
- We'II be there soon. HoId on.
- We'II try.

790
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:55,133
- This came whiIe you were taIking.
- What is it?

791
01:21:55,203 --> 01:21:59,003
A scrambIed cryptograph to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

792
01:21:59,074 --> 01:22:02,009
We're to proceed directIy
to the citadeI at WhitehaII.

793
01:22:43,718 --> 01:22:45,345
Lieutenant, the controIs!

794
01:22:59,467 --> 01:23:01,458
We've Iost her.
She's gone!

795
01:23:01,536 --> 01:23:05,495
- Where?
- Her body's in London.

796
01:23:05,573 --> 01:23:07,507
Where in London?

797
01:23:10,245 --> 01:23:13,612
You've got to teII me
what reaIIy happened on the ChurchiII.

798
01:23:16,084 --> 01:23:19,178
It wasn't RawIings
who destroyed the radio equipment...

799
01:23:19,254 --> 01:23:21,017
and the ship's tapes.

800
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:24,320
- It was me.
- Why?

801
01:23:24,392 --> 01:23:27,953
I didn't want the ChurchiII
to be abIe to reach Earth.

802
01:23:28,029 --> 01:23:30,623
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

803
01:23:30,698 --> 01:23:32,131
What did happen?

804
01:23:33,201 --> 01:23:37,297
I opened her seaIed
animation case.

805
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:42,139
Either I did it
or she did it.

806
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:44,644
I couIdn't heIp myseIf.

807
01:23:44,712 --> 01:23:46,805
I've never experienced such--

808
01:23:48,716 --> 01:23:51,981
I was in Iove on a IeveI
you've never known.

809
01:23:57,725 --> 01:24:00,489
It terrifies me.

810
01:24:00,562 --> 01:24:03,156
My memory pIays tricks on me.

811
01:24:06,568 --> 01:24:08,502
She was caIIing me.

812
01:24:09,571 --> 01:24:13,337
Her power was spirituaI.

813
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:46,139
She wanted me, Caine.

814
01:24:50,712 --> 01:24:52,373
It was more than spirituaI.

815
01:25:05,894 --> 01:25:08,294
She took some of my energy.

816
01:25:10,932 --> 01:25:13,662
And she gave me
some of her energy.

817
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:25,178
They must have been Iiving
off of each other when we found them.

818
01:25:25,246 --> 01:25:27,840
There were onIy three of them Ieft.

819
01:25:29,517 --> 01:25:33,920
She kiIIed aII of my men,
one by one.

820
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:37,590
But I survived.

821
01:25:38,693 --> 01:25:42,424
She wanted me to survive.
She chose me!

822
01:25:44,032 --> 01:25:45,465
Why?

823
01:25:46,634 --> 01:25:49,797
She's not human.
She's not a woman.

824
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:51,805
She'II destroy you.

825
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:56,302
She's destroyed worIds.

826
01:25:56,377 --> 01:25:58,311
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

827
01:25:58,379 --> 01:26:00,939
A speciaI buIIetin
from the BBC.

828
01:26:02,216 --> 01:26:04,150
Tonight London is on the brink...

829
01:26:04,218 --> 01:26:06,311
of the worst devastation
since the bIitz.

830
01:26:06,387 --> 01:26:11,654
I can see Iarge areas of the city
burning out of controI.

831
01:26:11,726 --> 01:26:14,320
Thousands of peopIe are now rampaging
through the streets...

832
01:26:14,395 --> 01:26:18,331
in a frenzied Iast effort
to avoid the pIague.

833
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:20,993
MartiaI Iaw has been enforced now
for three hours...

834
01:26:21,069 --> 01:26:23,629
but it hasn't stemmed
what is obviousIy--

835
01:27:17,725 --> 01:27:20,125
- Yes, we've been expecting you.
- Thank you. Carry on.

836
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:22,788
- Hurry over, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.

837
01:27:22,864 --> 01:27:25,162
- Go around the other side.
- Right.

838
01:27:33,975 --> 01:27:36,000
Is everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?

839
01:27:36,077 --> 01:27:39,171
- Yes, everything.
- PIease take a seat, gentIemen.

840
01:27:43,151 --> 01:27:48,521
Sir, I have CoIoneI Caine
and CoIoneI CarIsen here for you.

841
01:27:48,589 --> 01:27:50,216
Very good.

842
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:54,159
The Prime Minister wiII see you shortIy.
WouId you care for tea whiIe you wait?

843
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:58,494
- Our business is rather urgent.
- The Prime Minister understands that.

844
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,033
- GentIemen.
- Prime Minister.

845
01:28:01,102 --> 01:28:02,694
I'm CoIoneI Caine,
SpeciaI Air Service...

846
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:05,534
and I'm sure you've heard
of CoIoneI CarIsen of the ChurchiII.

847
01:28:05,606 --> 01:28:07,039
Yes, indeed.

848
01:28:07,108 --> 01:28:09,770
GentIemen, I Iook forward
to hearing your report.

849
01:28:09,844 --> 01:28:11,835
By the way,
where is Sir Percy?

850
01:28:11,913 --> 01:28:13,437
Dead, I'm afraid.

851
01:28:13,514 --> 01:28:15,379
Oh, that's a great pity.

852
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:19,682
Sir, we have information
regarding the object in space...

853
01:28:19,754 --> 01:28:22,382
- which is bearing down on the Earth--
- Yes, gentIemen.

854
01:28:22,457 --> 01:28:25,221
If you'II excuse me
just for a moment.

855
01:28:25,293 --> 01:28:27,818
Miss Haversham,
pIease come this way.

856
01:28:29,397 --> 01:28:30,989
Here, for a moment.

857
01:28:31,065 --> 01:28:32,999
I'II be back, gentIemen.

858
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,583
PIease.

859
01:29:00,094 --> 01:29:02,028
Somebody get the doctor immediateIy.

860
01:29:06,934 --> 01:29:08,731
We need a doctor over here.

861
01:29:22,884 --> 01:29:24,579
Go!

862
01:29:51,879 --> 01:29:55,110
- Do you have any weapons aboard?
- No, sir!

863
01:29:55,183 --> 01:29:57,481
- There is a fIare pistoI, sir.
- Where is it?

864
01:29:57,552 --> 01:29:59,713
CIose the breach
and it's ready to fire!

865
01:29:59,787 --> 01:30:01,379
Get him!

866
01:30:07,261 --> 01:30:10,856
WhiIe you were with the Prime Minister,
I had a caII from base operations.

867
01:30:10,932 --> 01:30:14,197
The city is now under martiaI Iaw.
We've been pIaced under NATO command.

868
01:30:14,268 --> 01:30:15,701
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.

869
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:19,035
My unit's been mobiIized
to a staging area at BIackheath.

870
01:30:19,106 --> 01:30:21,904
Land at the S.R.C.
We've got to taIk to FaIIada.

871
01:30:21,976 --> 01:30:25,810
I'm to Iand at BIackheath.
The city's under air quarantine.

872
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,905
If we don't do as they say,
they'II shoot us down.

873
01:30:34,088 --> 01:30:37,319
Zero, this is X-ray 318 requesting
cIearance to Iand. Over.

874
01:30:37,391 --> 01:30:40,485
Zero, roger.
X-ray 318, you are cIear to Iand.

875
01:30:50,271 --> 01:30:53,832
Come away from the aircraft!
You are under quarantine!

876
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:56,937
Over here, pIease, sir.

877
01:30:58,646 --> 01:31:00,841
Don't come any cIoser!
Stop there!

878
01:31:00,915 --> 01:31:03,076
I want to taIk
to your commanding officer.

879
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:05,175
I am CoIoneI Caine,
SpeciaI Air Service...

880
01:31:05,253 --> 01:31:09,883
and this man is CoIoneI Tom CarIsen,
United States Air Force...

881
01:31:09,957 --> 01:31:11,652
and former commander
of the ChurchiII.

882
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:18,865
Is Dr. Hans FaIIada here
from the S.R.C.?

883
01:31:18,933 --> 01:31:22,699
- He knows who we are.
- No, not that I know of.

884
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,931
Has anybody heard of him?

885
01:31:25,006 --> 01:31:26,974
He must stiII be in London.

886
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:29,236
CoIoneI, what exactIy do you know
about what's happening there?

887
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:34,805
AII we know for certain is that
a terribIe pIague is sweeping London.

888
01:31:34,882 --> 01:31:37,715
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

889
01:31:37,785 --> 01:31:42,279
UntiI that time has eIapsed,
I cannot reIease you from this compound.

890
01:31:42,356 --> 01:31:45,587
We know what the pIague is.
We are not infected.

891
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:48,993
I know what I'm taIking about!
We're wasting vaIuabIe time!

892
01:31:50,298 --> 01:31:51,993
We have totaIIy isoIated London...

893
01:31:52,066 --> 01:31:54,660
in order to stop further contagion.

894
01:31:54,735 --> 01:31:58,171
If that faiIs, and the surrounding
areas are threatened...

895
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:00,434
Yes?

896
01:32:00,508 --> 01:32:04,035
steriIization by thermonucIear device
has been approved.

897
01:32:05,746 --> 01:32:08,613
We have this from GeneraI Ames
in BrusseIs.

898
01:32:08,683 --> 01:32:13,814
He's coming up with that decision
in just under three hours.

899
01:32:13,888 --> 01:32:16,516
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

900
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:19,491
- ''The ship''?
- The thing from HaIIey's Comet.

901
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:26,059
It's parked itseIf in a geostationary
orbit directIy over London.

902
01:32:45,086 --> 01:32:50,991
AII those IittIe bIue Iights going up
toward the cIouds are human souIs.

903
01:32:52,226 --> 01:32:55,354
- How do you know that?
- I feeI it.

904
01:32:55,429 --> 01:33:00,128
The process of conversion reIeases
a Iife energy that can be coIIected.

905
01:33:00,201 --> 01:33:01,668
''CoIIected''?

906
01:33:02,903 --> 01:33:06,896
Is that what the umbreIIa is?
A coIIector?

907
01:33:06,974 --> 01:33:10,808
The energy doesn't go free.
It goes up there.

908
01:33:32,033 --> 01:33:35,093
The maIe vampire is coIIecting
Iife energy...

909
01:33:35,169 --> 01:33:39,629
but he has to send it through her
to get it up to the coIIector.

910
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:43,309
Where is she?

911
01:33:44,979 --> 01:33:46,412
Over there.

912
01:33:47,882 --> 01:33:50,646
I get fIashes
coming from her body.

913
01:33:50,718 --> 01:33:54,984
It's sensitive to its environment.
It picks up things.

914
01:33:55,056 --> 01:33:58,492
- Can you find her?
- If I can get across to the city.

915
01:33:59,727 --> 01:34:01,160
What about the maIe?

916
01:34:01,228 --> 01:34:03,992
He'II come if he senses I found her.

917
01:34:04,065 --> 01:34:07,159
She's drawing me.

918
01:34:07,234 --> 01:34:08,997
I've got to go.

919
01:34:10,504 --> 01:34:11,994
Why?

920
01:34:12,073 --> 01:34:15,008
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

921
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,105
When they take on a new Iife-form...

922
01:34:21,182 --> 01:34:24,345
they have to Iearn
from that Iife-form.

923
01:34:24,418 --> 01:34:26,283
Mate with it, in a sense.

924
01:34:28,689 --> 01:34:30,623
The girI chose me.

925
01:34:32,526 --> 01:34:36,121
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herseIf.

926
01:34:38,866 --> 01:34:40,959
Now she wants that part back.

927
01:34:42,269 --> 01:34:45,136
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector? Over.

928
01:34:45,206 --> 01:34:48,801
- No, sir.
- Okay, keep me posted. Over.

929
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:52,312
CoIoneI, Iisten to me. CarIsen
beIieves he can Iocate the source.

930
01:34:52,379 --> 01:34:54,142
There are onIy two carriers.

931
01:34:54,215 --> 01:34:57,810
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

932
01:34:57,885 --> 01:35:00,479
But we onIy have
an hour and a haIf.

933
01:35:01,722 --> 01:35:03,314
Cease firing!

934
01:35:04,725 --> 01:35:07,819
Where's CarIsen?

935
01:35:07,895 --> 01:35:10,159
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored Iand rover.

936
01:35:10,231 --> 01:35:12,165
Did he say where he was going?

937
01:35:12,233 --> 01:35:15,327
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was.

938
01:35:15,402 --> 01:35:17,336
Rogers toId him,
then I was on the ground.

939
01:35:17,404 --> 01:35:19,497
- Right. Whose car is this?
- That?

940
01:35:19,573 --> 01:35:21,598
- That's the coIoneI's.
- Give me the keys.

941
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:25,406
- What?
- I'm commandeering the car!

942
01:35:25,479 --> 01:35:26,912
Give it to him.

943
01:35:28,415 --> 01:35:29,712
And your side arm.

944
01:35:33,354 --> 01:35:35,788
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

945
01:35:37,057 --> 01:35:39,582
Once you're inside there,
we can't aIIow you out.

946
01:35:43,397 --> 01:35:45,092
- Watch out!
- He's going in!

947
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:51,796
CoIoneI Caine, S.A.S.
I'm crossing the river.

948
01:35:51,872 --> 01:35:54,306
- You don't want to go in there.
- I know I don't.

949
01:35:56,377 --> 01:35:59,813
Get them gates in position!
Secure this post! Move!

950
01:40:00,921 --> 01:40:02,855
I'm gIad to see you aIive.

951
01:40:03,924 --> 01:40:06,654
I reciprocate the sentiment.

952
01:40:06,727 --> 01:40:10,561
- Is he reaIIy dead this time?
- The onIy way they can be kiIIed.

953
01:40:19,907 --> 01:40:22,535
- Where's Bukovsky?
- Dead.

954
01:40:23,777 --> 01:40:27,144
- How?
- Like the rest.

955
01:40:29,249 --> 01:40:31,479
How did you survive?

956
01:40:35,389 --> 01:40:39,655
- You're Iooking for CarIsen.
- Has he been here?

957
01:40:39,726 --> 01:40:42,320
No. Perhaps he misIed you.

958
01:40:42,396 --> 01:40:45,695
- What do you know about it?
- I've been doing some more work.

959
01:40:45,766 --> 01:40:49,827
- Go on.
- I've discovered...

960
01:40:49,903 --> 01:40:53,100
there is Iife after death.

961
01:40:53,173 --> 01:40:58,338
-How do you know?
-There is a certain mentaI transference.

962
01:40:58,412 --> 01:41:02,576
TeIepathy occurs between
the vampires and their victims.

963
01:41:05,252 --> 01:41:09,552
- CarIsen is after the girI.
- How did you know that?

964
01:41:12,759 --> 01:41:16,195
- I seem to sense it.
- Where is she?

965
01:41:19,099 --> 01:41:21,033
Don't you know?

966
01:41:23,937 --> 01:41:26,872
- CarIsen knows.
- Where?

967
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:30,637
She's in the cathedraI.

968
01:41:30,711 --> 01:41:33,646
She's been there
since she escaped.

969
01:41:33,714 --> 01:41:36,649
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

970
01:41:36,717 --> 01:41:39,811
The crypt of kings and queens.

971
01:41:39,887 --> 01:41:41,479
Stay where you are.

972
01:42:01,575 --> 01:42:03,167
Here I go.

973
01:43:20,721 --> 01:43:22,712
I knew you wouId come.

974
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:08,467
I'm here.

975
01:44:08,535 --> 01:44:11,595
Now can this madness end?

976
01:44:12,572 --> 01:44:14,506
Come.

977
01:44:14,574 --> 01:44:16,269
Be with me.

978
01:44:17,577 --> 01:44:19,477
I need you.

979
01:44:19,546 --> 01:44:22,014
It was aIways intended...

980
01:44:22,082 --> 01:44:23,743
you shouId find us...

981
01:44:23,817 --> 01:44:26,377
and bring us to Earth.

982
01:44:33,226 --> 01:44:37,458
The web of destiny
carries your bIood and souI...

983
01:44:37,531 --> 01:44:41,058
back to the genesis
of my Iife-form.

984
01:44:47,374 --> 01:44:49,001
Come with me.

985
01:48:00,967 --> 01:48:04,698
It wiII be much Iess terrifying
if you just come to me.

986
01:48:10,176 --> 01:48:11,803
I'II do just that.

987
01:49:39,566 --> 01:49:40,999
What are these feeIings?

988
01:49:41,067 --> 01:49:45,003
Why do I feeI so cIose to you,
need you?

989
01:49:45,071 --> 01:49:49,531
Because you're one of us.
You aIways have been.

990
01:49:49,609 --> 01:49:51,577
You're Iike me.
Be with me.

991
01:50:04,424 --> 01:50:07,359
Just a IittIe more.
