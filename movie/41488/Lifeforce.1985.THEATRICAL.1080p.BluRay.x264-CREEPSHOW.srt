1
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,369
Treachery in the Senate!

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,209
The Jedi Council suspects
that Senator Rush Clovis

3
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,969
is secretly taking part
in a Separatist conspiracy.

4
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:28,650
But to find out
what the Senator from Scipio is up to,

5
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,690
the Council will need a spy of its own.

6
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:35,330
Meanwhile, Jedi Anakin Skywalker
has been away from Coruscant

7
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:38,250
on a lengthy tour of duty
leading the clone army.

8
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:41,291
Now Anakin returns
for a long-awaited reunion

9
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,450
with his wife, Padmé Amidala.

10
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,290
Master Ani! What a delight to see you.

11
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:48,731
- I shall tell Mistress...
- Anakin!

12
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:53,931
- That will be all, Threepio.
- Are you sure, my lady?

13
00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:58,251
- Yes, Threepio. Now go.
- Oh. Very well.

14
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:10,732
- I brought dinner.
- How did you manage this?

15
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:13,572
I had to hitch a ride on a cargo freighter.

16
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:16,013
What happened to your military transport?

17
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:18,412
It blew up.

18
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:23,053
Anyway, the freighter captain was
bringing a shipment to a restaurant here,

19
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:26,093
and he gave me something to bring home.
We just have to...

20
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:30,414
- What?
- You called this "home. "

21
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:32,293
What else would I call it?

22
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:33,893
The Naboo ambassador
gave me something.

23
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:38,614
- I think I still have it here somewhere.
- Must be something good.

24
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:43,694
It is. It'll be perfect.
Five-blossom bread, my specialty.

25
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:47,975
- You have a specialty?
- I know how to make lots of things!

26
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:52,534
When I was little, I cooked every day.
I've been saving it for a special occasion.

27
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:58,895
An evening alone with you?
I can't think of an occasion more special.

28
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:10,056
Involved with the Separatists,
the Banking Clan is.

29
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,216
Discover the truth in this matter, we must.

30
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:15,376
I couldn't agree more, Master Yoda.
But if Senator Amidala

31
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:19,216
has already refused to spy on
Senator Clovis of the Banking delegation,

32
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:21,656
I'm not sure how we can change her mind.

33
00:02:21,777 --> 00:02:24,496
That is why we asked you
to summon young Skywalker.

34
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:28,697
I have been signaling him all night.
I don't know where he could be.

35
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:37,577
- I wish it could always be just like this.
- Me, too.

36
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:46,457
- I have to report to the Jedi Council.
- Right now?

37
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,498
Actually, about seven clicks ago.

38
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,818
If I keep delaying, Obi-Wan will send
a clone squad out to find me.

39
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,218
I've been ducking his signals all night.

40
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:58,098
I understand.

41
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,098
- I can sense that you're angry.
- Don't think you can read my mind.

44
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,340
We believe Senator Clovis
is conspiring with the Separatists.

45
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:26,220
We need to find out what he's planning.

46
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,980
Do you want me
to interrogate him, Master?

47
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:31,060
No. Treat Senator Clovis as a criminal
we should not.

48
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:34,580
The slightest misstep could cause
a major incident.

49
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:37,141
You feel if we provoke him,
we'll never find out what he's up to.

50
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,981
Exactly. We need someone who is not
a Jedi to get close to him for us.

51
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:42,421
Someone he won't suspect.

52
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:45,341
- If not a Jedi, who?
- A fellow Senator.

53
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:47,501
Selected Senator Amidala, we have.

54
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:50,941
You want her to spy on Clovis?
I don't think that's a good idea.

55
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:53,821
There has to be someone else
who's more qualified for this.

56
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,382
We chose Senator Amidala

57
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:58,262
because she and Clovis
entered the Senate in the same year.

58
00:03:58,302 --> 00:04:00,822
They served on the same committees.
They were

59
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,182
- good friends.
- I didn't know that.

60
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:09,182
Personal matters for the Senator
these are. Know them, why would you?

61
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:11,703
It's just that
I wouldn't expect Senator Amidala

62
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:13,423
to have a friend in the Banking Clan.

63
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:18,103
Master Yoda has already asked her
to spy on Clovis for us, and she refused.

64
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:23,263
Trust you she does, Skywalker.
That is why convince her, you must.

65
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:27,223
Yes, Master.

66
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:39,344
- Senator Amidala.
- General Skywalker.

67
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:41,584
You finally found some time for me.

68
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:45,464
- Are you still mad about last night?
- Why would I be mad? I'm not mad.

69
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:49,304
Good. Now tell me
about your dealings with Senator Clovis.

70
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:52,945
So, you're here on Jedi business.

71
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:58,265
I already told Master Yoda I don't want
to spy on a colleague and an old friend.

72
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:01,466
"Old friend"?
How well do you know Clovis?

73
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:04,985
Why does that matter?
That was before we were together.

74
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,306
I'm just trying
to get a sense of who this guy is.

75
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:15,786
I'll need to brief
whoever does end up spying on him.

76
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,506
Oh, I thought you were here to talk me
into becoming an agent for the Jedi.

77
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:24,026
That is not a job for you.
I don't agree with the Council on this.

78
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:26,187
If Clovis is involved
in a Separatist conspiracy,

79
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:28,827
the last place you should be
is anywhere near him.

80
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,787
Clovis is conspiring with the Separatists?
Yoda didn't tell me that!

81
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,947
I can't believe Clovis would do that.
This is terrible.

82
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:40,747
I never expected that from him.

83
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:44,987
- Someone has to find out the truth.
- Someone does, just not you.

84
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,588
- Why not me?
- Because it's going to be dangerous.

85
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:52,188
Whoever takes this mission
will be putting their life at risk.

86
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:56,788
I've been in many tough situations before.
It never seemed to bother you.

87
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:00,149
I never stopped you from facing danger.
You're constantly getting shot at...

88
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,989
I've been trained for that.
It's very different from spying on a traitor.

89
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,749
You mean I can't handle the mission.

90
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,989
I mean
I'm not gonna let you do it.

91
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,670
You're not going to let me?
It's not your decision to make. It's mine.

92
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,470
Lucky for us,
you've already decided to refuse.

93
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,630
Actually, I just changed my mind.

94
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,670
You've convinced me
that it's vital to learn what Clovis is doing.

95
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:27,390
- I accept the mission to spy on him.
- Even though I'm telling you not to.

96
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:32,791
Don't take it personally, Anakin.
Duty comes first, especially in wartime.

97
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:41,311
First, I'll need
to get back in touch with him.

98
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:43,631
Clovis and I haven't spoken in a long time.

99
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:46,871
A surprise that is, given your past.

100
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:51,352
- What does that mean, Senator?
- At one point, Clovis and I were close.

101
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:56,032
It was my choice to return things
to a strictly professional level.

102
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:57,752
Clovis didn't take it well.

103
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,073
Do you think you'll be able
to rekindle your friendship with him?

104
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:04,513
Master, Senator Clovis
is a very dangerous man.

105
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,113
If he realizes she's trying to trick him...

106
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:10,913
I'm aware of the risks, Master Jedi,
but I know I can regain Clovis' trust.

107
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:14,193
Good. The closer you can get to him,
the better.

108
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:18,514
I understand. I'll do whatever is necessary
to succeed in my mission.

109
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:22,393
And I'll do whatever I have to
to protect her.

110
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,035
It's been good to see you again, Clovis.

111
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:39,914
I didn't realize how lonely I was
until tonight.

112
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:42,355
Perhaps I can do more
to ease your loneliness

113
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,475
once I return from Cato Neimoidia.

114
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,755
- Oh, you're taking a pleasure trip?
- Hardly.

115
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:52,315
I'm going there to put the fear of Scipio in
those overgrown Trade Federation grubs.

116
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:53,715
You know how they are.

117
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:56,435
They love to borrow money
from the Banking Clan,

118
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,396
but they hate to pay it back.

119
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:00,836
Maybe you can say a few words
on my behalf.

120
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,516
I'm on the HoloNet with the Neimoidians
every day asking for trade concessions,

121
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:07,356
but I can't ever seem to make progress.

122
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:09,036
I've got an idea.

123
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:12,996
Come with me to Cato Neimoidia
and speak to them in person.

124
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:17,236
I have leverage from the Banking Clan,
you have diplomatic contacts.

125
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,876
We can help each other.

126
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,517
Are you inviting me for political reasons

127
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,957
or because you want us
to be friends again?

128
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,317
Both, of course,

129
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,518
although I'm far more interested
in your friendship than your politics.

130
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:37,078
In that case, I'll be happy to go with you.
It'll be like old times.

131
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:42,039
On the contrary.
I hope it'll be much better than old times.

132
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:52,279
- Senator Clovis.
- Padmé! You look exquisite.

133
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,519
If you get tired,
you can rest your head on my shoulder.

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,319
Allow me, my lady.
And this one's broken. Too bad.

135
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:13,400
We're ready for takeoff, Captain.

136
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,880
All I have to do is fly the ship.

137
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,441
Blast it!

138
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:01,363
Senator Amidala. An unexpected privilege.

139
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:05,323
Senator Dod, please forgive me
for arriving unannounced.

140
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,723
Oh, no, always a pleasure to see you,
my dear.

141
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:14,763
- I hope you and I can make a fresh start.
- I came here with the very same hope.

142
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:19,884
- I believe in second chances.
- So do I, Senator. So do I.

143
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,524
My servants will see you to your room.

144
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:31,445
Clovis and I have some business
to discuss.

145
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,365
I hope you will be comfortable here.

146
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:45,365
This investment by the Banking Clan
will create unimaginable new war profits.

147
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:50,965
- The largest droid factory ever built.
- As long as the Republic doesn't find out.

148
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:54,005
You should never have brought
a member of the Senate here!

149
00:10:55,327 --> 00:11:00,846
Threepio, after that long trip,
I think I need a walk.

150
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,327
That could prove interesting.

151
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:06,206
I agree, Lord Poggle.

152
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:11,327
For all the risks we're taking, we should
be getting a greater share of the profits.

153
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:21,887
Are you suggesting
we change the terms of our agreement?

154
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:26,208
No, a deal is a deal.
I'd hate for something to happen to you.

155
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:32,128
You forget yourself, Clovis.
You cannot threaten me on my own planet.

156
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:34,288
This is hardly your planet anymore,

157
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:37,048
not since you signed your holdings over
to the Banking Clan

158
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,289
in return for a stake
in this new droid foundry.

159
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,289
We have company. The hologram.

160
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,449
Padmé, what are you doing here?

161
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:52,329
Oh, I'm sorry to intrude. I was lonely,
so I came looking for you, and...

162
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,649
My dear, I'll give you a proper tour later.

163
00:11:56,371 --> 00:12:00,210
Now let me take you back to your room
so you can get dressed for dinner.

164
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,449
Now if you'll excuse me,

165
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,810
I'll see you at dinner.

166
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,810
How do you think I feel?
I hate the thought of answering to Clovis.

167
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:21,490
But perhaps we won't have to,
now that we've finally found his weakness.

168
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:25,851
What if we were
to poison Senator Amidala?

169
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:28,891
I think Clovis would do anything
to save her,

170
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,451
and only we would have the antidote.

171
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:41,212
No, thanks, Artoo. I'm not hungry.

172
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,292
As soon as Senator Amidala
finds something,

173
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,652
she's gonna signal me to come inside.

174
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:05,653
Senator, as my honored guest,
please share this drink with me.

175
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,614
A toast to our new friendship.

176
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:18,614
Of course.

177
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:26,934
Come, Senator,
everyone is eager to meet you.

178
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:37,495
What a wonderful meal.
My compliments to the droid.

179
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:44,856
Are you feeling all right?

180
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:52,696
- I'm fine. I stood up too fast.
- It has been a very long day.

181
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:55,736
Perhaps we should retire
to the guest quarters.

182
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:59,736
Unless you'd like a tour of the palace.
It's truly worth seeing.

183
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:02,137
A tour sounds perfect.

184
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:04,857
You're dismissed for the night.

185
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:09,337
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

186
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,897
Well, really! My services not required
for the rest of the evening.

187
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:21,818
Why isn't Padmé with you?

188
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,898
She is with Senator Clovis.
He offered her a private tour of the palace.

189
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:29,618
- And you let her go off with him?
- I did try to warn her.

190
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,699
I'm waiting
for my business venture to start.

191
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,419
I'm doing some private investing
with guaranteed returns.

192
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,139
Could you bring me something to drink?

193
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,499
I'm so thirsty all of a sudden,
and my head is pounding.

194
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,179
Oh, you poor thing. It's the climate change.
I'll be right back.

195
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:05,380
- Display hologram.
Passcode required.

196
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:11,101
"Scipio. " "Banking Clan. "
"Senator Clovis. "

197
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:14,141
"Baron Rush Clovis. " "Rush. "

198
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:19,741
- "Padmé"?
Passcode accepted.

199
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:24,542
Tactical coordinates
for Count Dooku's new droid foundry.

200
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:26,902
And Clovis and the Banking Clan
are behind it.

201
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:30,262
The Jedi Council has to see this evidence.

202
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:34,461
Finally! Gotta go!

203
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:37,982
It seems no one
wants my company tonight.

204
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,782
Still dying of thirst?

205
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:56,664
Ah! That tastes so good.
I guess I was just thirsty.

206
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:59,463
Come, Padmé. Give me your hand.

207
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:07,864
You're so good to me, Clovis.
I don't deserve your kindness.

208
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:10,624
It's nice to hear you say that.

209
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,344
I've been waiting for this moment all night.

210
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:26,984
- Your heart is racing.
- Because of you.

211
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,065
I wasn't sure you still had feelings for me,
but now...

212
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,905
I would have said something earlier,

213
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:39,345
but we were
in the middle of our official duties,

214
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:42,866
and duty comes first, no matter...

215
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:46,786
- No matter how we feel.
- Padmé, what's wrong?

216
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:51,107
Take good care of this, Artoo.

217
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,306
Get the ship ready for takeoff.

218
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:00,307
Stay with her. I'll go get a medical droid.

219
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:04,547
An excellent idea. I'm afraid this situation
is quite beyond my capacity.

220
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,788
If I'm not here in five minutes,
leave without me.

221
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:12,307
No matter what happens,
the Council has to see this hologram.

222
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,547
I know her symptoms.
She's been poisoned.

223
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,788
- What do you mean?
- She could die.

224
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,108
Get a hold of yourself, Senator.
She is a Republic spy!

225
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,709
What? No!

226
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,749
Passcode "Padmé."

227
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,989
No hologram is available.

228
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,710
She did steal it!

229
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:46,949
Leave us.

230
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:53,230
I was just in the library.
The hologram disk is gone.

231
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:58,910
I see now why you renewed our friendship,
so you could spy on me and steal from me.

232
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:01,510
I did it for the Republic.

233
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:05,190
I didn't want to believe that you were
involved with the Separatists,

234
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:08,230
but you are. You're a traitor!

235
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:10,151
Where is the disk you stole?

236
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:14,591
It's on its way to the Senate.
Your scheme is finished!

237
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,111
Get away from her if you wanna live.

238
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:22,152
Padmé!

239
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:25,071
How dare you speak like that to me?
I'm a Senator!

240
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:29,952
- What's wrong with her?
- Lott Dod poisoned her. She's dying.

241
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:33,112
I'll take her to the doctors on Coruscant.

242
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:36,512
There's not enough time for that.
Lott Dod must have an antidote.

243
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:39,912
She's stolen a very valuable disk from me.

244
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:43,113
Return it
and I'll get the antidote from Lott Dod.

245
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:45,833
I prefer to negotiate
with Lott Dod in person.

246
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:49,953
- No! He cannot be told...
- What? That you lost the disk?

247
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:54,593
I'm sure he'd be very interested
in hearing all about this.

248
00:18:54,634 --> 00:19:00,234
He might kill me if he finds out.
But still, it's her life that I worry about.

249
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,074
She must be saved, because I love her.

250
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:07,274
In that case, I suggest you help us
back to the Senator's ship

251
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,274
before Lott Dod finds anything out.

252
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,555
Come with me! Quickly!

253
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:22,795
We must make haste.

254
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,956
What is going on, Clovis?

255
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:33,156
I'm sorry, Lott, Senator Amidala is very ill
and we're taking her to her ship.

256
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:37,036
If Senator Amidala is ill,
she should not be moved.

257
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:40,396
I have contacted the authorities on Naboo.

258
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:42,756
They thought it best
to take her back to Coruscant.

259
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:46,237
- The doctors there are better equipped.
- You cannot leave!

260
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:51,717
- Give me the antidote or you're dead!
- You'll pay for this.

261
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,636
Give Clovis the antidote.

262
00:19:58,118 --> 00:20:01,277
Your kindness
is much appreciated, Senator.

263
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:03,157
Take her, quickly!

264
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,318
Have you lost your mind?

265
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,238
Wait! Give me back my disk!

266
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,838
Don't worry, Clovis.
It's good to know you have a heart.

267
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,519
I wish I could give you the disk,

268
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,918
but I have a lot of faith
in your survival skills.

269
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,159
Where's that medicine, Threepio?

270
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,559
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,480
What for?
We got away and we have the hologram.

272
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:49,720
The Jedi will use that information
to destroy Count Dooku's foundry.

273
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:53,560
- Your mission was a success.
- But I made you doubt me.

274
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:55,600
Never.

275
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:58,720
Clovis, we need to talk.

276
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:40,923
