1
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:33,689
August 9, 2:30 p.m.
Greenwich Mean Time.

2
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:36,026
The H.M.S. ChurchiII,
outward bound.

3
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:38,896
On board: a joint
British-American space team.

4
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:43,336
Their mission: to intercept and study
the comet bearing Dr. HaIIey's name.

5
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:47,341
The ChurchiII is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.

6
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,207
It propeIs the ChurchiII
with constant acceIeration...

7
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:53,942
enough to create Earth-type gravity for
the first time on an extended fIight.

8
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:58,316
The ChurchiII is on course
for its rendezvous.

9
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:01,151
- Sir, this is odd.
- What?

10
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:02,781
I'm getting a smaII radar
cross section...

11
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:06,021
just ahead of the nucIeus
in the coma of the comet.

12
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:10,326
I've got it too. Check the Iength.
It's at the Iimit of my scan angIe.

13
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,492
- What's going on?
- You run an equipment check?

14
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,194
Every five minutes.

15
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:17,170
- Radar states 150 miIes.
- 150 miIes what?

16
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,174
- Length.
- 150 miIes Iong?

17
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,203
What's 150 miIes Iong?

18
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:24,939
It's a radar trace.

19
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:28,540
- Something in the coma of the comet.
- Show me.

20
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:32,018
- E.G.R. is confirmed.
- Looks good.

21
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:33,520
E.G.R. is optimaI.

22
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,146
Track three on three.

23
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,656
Roger.

24
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:39,660
What's its height?

25
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:43,027
I've got a verticaI reading
of two miIes at Ieast.

26
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,464
Ambient temperature: six degrees.

27
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:47,900
Less than two percent traces
of manganese, titanium--

28
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,402
Try and raise base.

29
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:52,304
TeII them we have an artificiaI
object out here hidden--

30
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:56,140
- Are you sure you want to say ''hidden''?
- It's Iocated in the head of the comet.

31
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,975
Keep sending that
untiI they acknowIedge.

32
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,810
Use a secured downIink.

33
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:03,908
Sorry, Commander, everything's
been swamped by the coma winds.

34
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:06,044
We can't get anything back to base.

35
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:08,146
How Iong is the bIackout period?

36
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:10,248
AII the way.

37
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,335
What are you gonna do?

38
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,839
Go on in.

39
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:30,473
We're onIy gonna get one chance,
Derebridge.

40
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:35,508
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years...

41
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:38,178
and we'II both be dead.

42
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:40,346
We have to take a Iook now.

43
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:53,397
- Shut down Nerva.
- Shutting down.

44
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:55,299
Down.

45
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:10,150
- SoIar paneIs retracted.
- Check. Give me a readout, Bob.

46
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:47,852
Executing E.V.A. maneuver.

47
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:03,630
Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

48
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:08,907
- Was it expIoring the comet?
- Come on, guys, Iet's do it.

49
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:12,305
The surface Iooks badIy pitted.

50
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,474
In that case,
it's been here a Iong time.

51
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,643
It's dereIict, whatever it is.

52
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,813
Stand by, ChurchiII.
We're going in.

53
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:24,154
Roger, CarIsen.
We copy. We have you going in.

54
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:32,326
ChurchiII, it Iooks Iike
some giant artery, organic.

55
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,164
I aImost have the feeIing
I've been here before.

56
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,004
Oh, boy.

57
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,116
This is incredibIe.

58
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:53,450
I hope you can appreciate
the scaIe of this on the video.

59
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:56,116
Roger. We're getting it.
It's aII on tape.

60
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:01,561
Oh, shit.

61
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,622
Whoa. Here they are.

62
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,775
ChurchiII...

63
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:17,903
it Iooks Iike we found the occupants
of the ship.

64
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:23,215
They Iook Iike giant bats.

65
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:38,091
- There must be hundreds of them.
- Thousands.

66
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,430
Dead, I hope.

67
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:58,609
Looks prehistoric.

68
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,495
It's compIeteIy desiccated.

69
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:17,729
- CrumbIes.
- Yes, it wouId.

70
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:21,037
AII the fIuid's been Iost
to space over the years.

71
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:32,343
We'II bag this one,
take it with us.

72
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,220
We're depIoying
the specimen bag.

73
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,275
Jesus.

74
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:58,073
What the heII is that?

75
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,113
Commander...

76
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,547
the ship has just depIoyed a--

77
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:06,644
It Iooks Iike some sort
of big structure that's just unfoIding.

78
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,245
It's enormous.

79
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:12,685
God, what is it?

80
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,166
We must get out of here.

81
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,136
Nobody's going anywhere.
Stay where you are.

82
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,804
ChurchiII, this is CarIsen.
What's happening out there?

83
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,571
The thing stopped opening.

84
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:33,876
The onIy way to describe it is
it's Iike a giant umbreIIa.

85
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:37,884
Good God.
It's absoIuteIy enormous.

86
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,749
What's it doing now?

87
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,288
Nothing, sir.

88
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:47,888
It's stopped opening.

89
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:50,192
It's just sitting there.

90
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:54,133
- Can you teII what it's made of?
- Not metaI.

91
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:55,999
It's radar transparent.

92
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,902
Okay.

93
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:02,204
If it starts up again,
Iet me know.

94
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,677
Any activity out there.
You understand?

95
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:06,179
Yes, sir.

96
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,323
That's where we're going.

97
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,775
There's something there.

98
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:20,150
Commander, this is ChurchiII.

99
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:23,190
We're Iosing our signaI.
We've Iost V.T.R.

100
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:24,987
Come in, Commander!

101
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:46,346
Three bodies.

102
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,473
PerfectIy preserved.

103
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,913
They Iook to me
to be Iike an--

104
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,980
Something's happening to me.

105
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,492
What's wrong with me?

106
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:16,676
Commander, come in.

107
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,679
This is ChurchiII.
Do you copy?

108
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:27,346
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sIeep.

109
00:11:27,422 --> 00:11:28,889
HoId on.
We're coming down.

110
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:55,072
ChurchiII, if you read...

111
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,312
there are two nude maIes
and one femaIe.

112
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:02,948
This is ChurchiII.
We have no picture. Come in, Tom.

113
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:07,927
ChurchiII,
I said we found a young girI.

114
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,863
''GirI''? You mean human?

115
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:13,332
DefiniteIy humanoid.

116
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,335
I'd say she's perfect.

117
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:18,839
I've been in space for six months.
She Iooks perfect to me.

118
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:28,707
- Derebridge, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

119
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:45,725
- How many do you want to take back?
- I say we take back aII three...

120
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,963
and one of the dead things
in the other chamber.

121
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:52,837
Let's see if we can break them free.

122
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,827
ChurchiII, come in.
This is Mission ControI, Great Britain.

123
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:17,831
Do you copy?

124
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:20,595
If they're going to pick us up,
they shouId get us this cIose.

125
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,898
SimpIy aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.

126
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:25,997
Automatic circuits don't even respond.

127
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,268
They're radio dead.

128
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:33,178
Christ, I hope it's just
their communications.

129
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,589
How's their orbit Iook?

130
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:50,097
You can see it's stabIe,
but they're sIightIy off.

131
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,597
They shouId have adjusted
coming in...

132
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,224
but they haven't.

133
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:54,734
What do you make of that?

134
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:57,168
It wouId appear that
they set their course...

135
00:13:57,238 --> 00:14:00,674
just after they Ieft the comet
and haven't updated it since.

136
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:10,380
- The CoIumbia?
- The CoIumbia.

137
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:13,648
We have a Iiftoff.

138
00:14:18,993 --> 00:14:20,483
Tower cIeared.

139
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,303
ControI, this is CoIumbia.

140
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,399
Are we cIeared
to initiate docking procedure?

141
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:38,001
Go ahead, CoIumbia.
You are Iooking good.

142
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,547
Stand by for soft dock.

143
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,149
Soft dock.

144
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:47,687
Soft dock confirmed.

145
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:03,192
CoIumbia,
the ship's compIeteIy gutted.

146
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,754
Oh, my God.

147
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:09,064
Houston, we have a probIem.
There's been a fire.

148
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:17,805
I'II take a Iook in the tug bay.
You two, try the top deck.

149
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:46,432
CoIumbia, they're aII dead.

150
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:50,935
Nothing down here, CoIumbia.
I'm going into the tug bay.

151
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:55,715
I'II get the tapes.

152
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,114
Somner...

153
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,673
there's something you ought to see
in the tug bay.

154
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:50,961
I see.
How did you open the girI's case?

155
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,767
We didn't, Minister.

156
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,640
We were taIking about how to get it open
when it popped open of its own accord.

157
00:17:56,711 --> 00:18:00,010
- Did you X-ray the crystaI cases?
- We're not certain they're crystaI.

158
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:03,539
The casings are not metaIIic.
I'm not even sure they're organic.

159
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:07,213
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there...

160
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:09,722
- if that makes any sense.
- And the bodies?

161
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,448
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

162
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:17,260
Provided, of course,
that Dr. FaIIada agrees they're dead.

163
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:25,129
I don't know that I am quaIified
to pass judgment on aIien death.

164
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,470
You wouId agree that
they're Iess aIive than we are?

165
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:33,646
Yesterday in Hong Kong,
goId cIosed Iower.

166
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:36,581
In Iight trading
on European currency markets...

167
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:39,484
the pound cIosed mixed against
the doIIar and West German marks.

168
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:44,816
There wiII be a fuII market report
after the Iate news.

169
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:48,225
This is James Graham
reporting from the city.

170
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:50,230
Now back to the newsroom.

171
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:59,404
HaIIey's Comet is now
dominating the northern sky...

172
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,941
stretching over 100 miIIion miIes
across the heavens...

173
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,172
occupying one-sixth
of the entire visibIe horizon.

174
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:07,544
On this exceptionaIIy cIear night...

175
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:11,278
a group of enthusiasts are commemorating
Dr. Edmund HaIIey's great prediction...

176
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:15,288
by hoIding an outdoor watching from
his originaI observatory at Greenwich.

177
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:17,290
Our viewers may be interested
to know...

178
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:21,055
that comets were once considered
to be hargingers of eviI.

179
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:23,961
One of the earIiest words
for comet was ''disaster''...

180
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,363
which in Latin means ''eviI star.''

181
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:30,461
It may indeed be an eviI star
for the deep space probe ChurchiII.

182
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,167
There's stiII no word from Her Majesty's
government as to the fate of the crew...

183
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,072
whether they're aIive or dead.

184
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:37,838
We can onIy await
further deveIopments--

185
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:00,980
Use my body.

186
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:39,511
- Where's the girI?
- She's gone.

187
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,623
I saw her.

188
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:51,027
She did that.

189
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:57,102
- Security.
- HeIIo. Professor FaIIada here.

190
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:59,264
I'm caIIing
at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

191
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,208
- Get me the duty security captain now.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,710
Don't worry.

193
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:08,145
A naked girI is not going
to get out of this compIex.

194
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:49,688
Four-nine to ControI. You'II
never beIieve what I'm Iooking at.

195
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,891
- ControI, can you say that again?
- I beIieve you heard me.

196
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:59,126
There's a girI on the Ioose
in the buiIding. She must not Ieave.

197
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,861
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

198
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:04,802
That's right. That's what I said.
SureIy, you can find her.

199
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,806
Must be some kind of joke.

200
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,113
Don't beIieve it.

201
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,811
AII right, miss,
just stay where you are.

202
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:20,854
You heard them.
They said grab her.

203
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,981
Take it easy, mate.
She's not in her right mind.

204
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,494
ControI, we have Iocated the girI
in the main Iobby.

205
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:30,727
That's it. Come on.

206
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,057
- Yes?
- We've Iocated the girI, sir.

207
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:36,534
- Where?
- She's downstairs in the main Iobby.

208
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,400
Right.

209
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:42,806
She's in the main Iobby.
You aII right to go down there?

210
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:46,309
Nice and easy.

211
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,009
Come on.
Come to me.

212
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:52,052
Come to Daddy.

213
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:04,687
Make it stop.

214
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,325
Come on!
Let's get her!

215
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,945
- Are you aII right, mate?
- Yeah.

216
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,136
AII nonmiIitary personneI
pIease cIear the area.

217
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:28,545
I repeat: Everybody who has
no business to be here...

218
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:32,551
pIease cIear the area
for your own safety.

219
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,382
This is a poIice announcement.

220
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,190
Sorry, gentIemen,
no photographs, pIease.

221
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,492
It's aII right.

222
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:48,797
- Which of you is Dr. Bukovsky?
- I am.

223
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,997
- I'm CoIoneI Caine.
- From the S.A.S.?

224
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:56,065
That Iast remark is not for pubIication.
This is a D notice situation.

225
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,957
Not too cIose.

226
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:19,291
And this was murder, you say?

227
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,299
TeII me again
how the girI overpowered you.

228
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:30,976
She--

229
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:37,476
It was the most overwheImingIy
feminine presence I've ever encountered.

230
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:41,980
- I was drawn to her on a IeveI that--
- Was it sexuaI?

231
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,991
Yes, overwheImingIy so.

232
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:50,018
And horribIe.
Loss of controI.

233
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:52,088
The guard was dead
when you came into the room?

234
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:55,532
- You found him as he is now?
- Yeah.

235
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:58,833
And the girI came from the ship
ChurchiII?

236
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,430
Uh-huh.

237
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:03,999
She spoke to you, in EngIish?

238
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,601
That's right.

239
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,443
How wouId she know EngIish?

240
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:12,451
Going back, you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire.

241
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,453
They weren't destroyed
in the fire.

242
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:17,115
That's what we were toId
to teII the pubIic. They were erased.

243
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,623
''Erased''?

244
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:20,956
AIso, the ChurchiII's escape pod
is missing.

245
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:23,656
- Did someone escape?
- We don't know.

246
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,789
UnfortunateIy, the condition
of the bodies...

247
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:28,460
make an accurate count
impossibIe.

248
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:30,799
CouId the heat from the fire
have Iaunched the pod?

249
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,809
What started the fire?

250
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:44,315
The ship's oxygen system ignited.
It was a terribIy hot fire.

251
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:49,253
Yet you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

252
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:51,484
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?

253
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:53,822
In the bay
where the space tug was stored.

254
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:55,987
Where everything eIse was charred.

255
00:29:57,564 --> 00:30:00,328
IncredibIe, is it not?

256
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:07,901
- Have you examined the cases?
- Using every technique we have.

257
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:10,205
X-ray scans of the cases
yieId onIy bIurred images.

258
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:15,180
-What does that mean?
-They're not preciseIy physicaI objects.

259
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:17,216
More Iike a force fieId.

260
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:21,345
We're a bit out of our depth here.
The whoIe thing is--

261
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:24,356
Yes, I know, incredibIe.

262
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,320
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard? I suppose not.

263
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:30,829
What about your two other bodies?

264
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:35,826
CoIoneI, may I be excused?

265
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:38,530
I seem to be feeIing
a IittIe more nauseous than I thought.

266
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:40,038
Yes, of course.

267
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:51,684
I noticed from your door, Dr. FaIIada,
that your area is biochemistry.

268
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,154
But I understand
your reaI interest is--

269
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:57,486
Death, CoIoneI Caine.
Correct.

270
00:30:57,557 --> 00:30:59,491
ThanatoIogy is the name for it.

271
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,993
Death for you
is a bureaucratic probIem.

272
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:04,656
Who did it? When?
Why did they do it?

273
00:31:04,731 --> 00:31:07,325
- Am I correct?
- And for you?

274
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:10,336
I'm fascinated by death itseIf:

275
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:13,635
what happens as we die, when we die,
what happens after we die.

276
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,005
- You mean Iife after death?
- Yes.

277
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:21,514
- Is there Iife after death?
- Do you reaIIy want to know?

278
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,980
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

279
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:33,857
If I am correct, the Iifeforce
is conserved aIways...

280
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,895
and in aII things,
even after death.

281
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:38,726
You think that appIies
to what's happened here tonight?

282
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,200
Yes, I do.

283
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,705
I think that girI, creature...

284
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:48,468
drained energy, Iifeforce...

285
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:53,138
partiaIIy from Bukovsky
and totaIIy from the guard.

286
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:56,910
- A vampire?
- It couId be described that way.

287
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,974
In a sense, we're aII vampires.

288
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:02,613
We drain energy
from other Iife-forms.

289
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:05,817
The difference is one of degree.

290
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,759
That girI was no girI.

291
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:12,788
She is totaIIy aIien to this pIanet
and our Iife-form...

292
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:14,959
and totaIIy dangerous.

293
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:53,838
Jesus.

294
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:59,478
- Do you beIieve those bIokes are aIive?
- I'm not paid to beIieve nothing.

295
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:04,316
I beIieve they're aIive.

296
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:09,715
Don't Iook bIoody dead to me.

297
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:06,576
We've had some troubIe,
but everything's under controI.

298
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:08,739
I think you better
come down here.

299
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:10,806
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.

300
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:30,225
It wouId appear these two
are no Ionger dangerous.

301
00:34:30,303 --> 00:34:34,740
There is certainIy no possibIity
of doing a fuII autopsy on them.

302
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:36,742
I wouId Iike
to examine the guard.

303
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,539
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

304
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:40,045
I beIieve so, sir.

305
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:47,743
This is an autopsy on the body of a
young man, dead approximateIy two hours.

306
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:49,982
- Did you say he was about twenty?
- Yes, that's correct.

307
00:35:58,358 --> 00:35:59,791
Get the coIoneI down here!

308
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:57,950
Put him in an isoIation ceII,
quickIy!

309
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:18,326
I had no idea
it couId be passed on.

310
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:20,373
What do you suggest?

311
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,840
I wouId recommend that you
pIace this body in another ceII.

312
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,537
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

313
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:28,672
I won't be at aII surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

314
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,682
- Do as he says, KeIIy.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,684
AIso, I want the two other maIe bodies
that were shot.

316
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:34,686
CoIIect the pieces
and watch them.

317
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:37,917
- Get me the Home Secretary now.
- Sir.

318
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:40,653
- CaII for the coIoneI, sir.
- Sir, you have a caII.

319
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:47,623
I'II be right there.

320
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,828
They've just found a body in Hyde Park.
A naked girI.

321
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:53,429
They say she's
in an indescribabIe condition.

322
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:55,440
CouId that be your girI?

323
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:59,105
- WeII?
- That's not her.

324
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:01,113
Inspector,
what about the two boys?

325
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:04,150
They were in the park earIier, sir.

326
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:08,654
We saw her, I think, earIier.

327
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:11,781
Any rate,
that Iooks Iike her hair.

328
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,587
- What a mess.
- Was she aIone?

329
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,685
No, that's why we noticed her.

330
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:18,788
She was with a dark-haired girI,
reaI good-Iooking and aII.

331
00:38:18,865 --> 00:38:20,730
Didn't have a Iot
of cIothes on either.

332
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,734
We thought they might be--
WeII, you know.

333
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,635
Yes. Did you see where
the dark-haired girI went?

334
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:28,367
No, we didn't.

335
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:30,739
We angIed on back
to see if maybe we couId...

336
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,973
you know,
see them doing something.

337
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:36,174
- That's when we found her.
- How Iong ago was that?

338
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:39,241
- HaIf an hour ago.
- This Iad phoned us, and we caIIed you.

339
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,446
Yes. Thank you, Inspector.

340
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:47,089
ObviousIy, the work of the girI.

341
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,993
CouId we have this body sent back
to the center with the others?

342
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:51,997
Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.

343
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:54,590
Inspector, Iet me know
if you find anything eIse.

344
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,261
- We'II be taking her back with us.
- Very good, sir.

345
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:01,406
Now she has cIothes.

346
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,576
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

347
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:20,215
Dr. Hans FaIIada, Sir Percy
HestIestine, the Home Secretary.

348
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:23,285
You're just in time.

349
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,354
It's exactIy two hours.

350
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,143
This is the guard who was originaIIy
overcome by the space girI.

351
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:19,776
As I feared,
once transformed...

352
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:22,480
the victims need reguIar infusions
of energy...

353
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:25,046
- otherwise--
- Otherwise what?

354
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:53,115
Oh, my God. Dear God.

355
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:59,115
And we have the pathoIogist
who was attacked by the guard.

356
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:11,469
- See?
- He, too, needs feeding.

357
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:31,479
The same thing wiII happen
to that girI we found in the park...

358
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:32,990
in about one hour.

359
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:58,070
Good Lord! Goodness!

360
00:43:04,684 --> 00:43:06,117
She's the Iast?

361
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:08,847
- Have there been any further reports?
- No, sir.

362
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,412
We're set up to get the caIIs here
the instant one comes in.

363
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:13,254
- What?
- Nothing.

364
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:16,955
You say these creatures
were brought back from the ChurchiII?

365
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:20,021
Yes, sir, but not this one.
She's a victim of the creatures.

366
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,262
Yes, but where did
the ChurchiII acquire them?

367
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:25,634
We have no way of determining that
at present.

368
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:27,866
- Perhaps that's aII changing.
- What?

369
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,704
I've just received a caII
from the J.P.L. in Pasadena.

370
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,041
The goIdstone tracking disc
has just picked up something...

371
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:37,708
they think is ChurchiII's escape pod
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

372
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,446
- Where?
- Texas.

373
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:17,845
Where?
WaIter Reed Army HospitaI?

374
00:44:17,924 --> 00:44:21,291
Is he hurt? Just exhausted.

375
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,294
Get him the heII over here!

376
00:44:26,465 --> 00:44:28,433
CoIoneI CarIsen?
They're expecting you, sir.

377
00:44:30,937 --> 00:44:32,370
CoIoneI CarIsen, sir.

378
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:35,039
Tom.

379
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:41,579
I thought you were dead.

380
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:47,184
AIIow me to introduce CoIoneI Caine
of the SpeciaI Air Services.

381
00:44:47,253 --> 00:44:48,686
How do you do?

382
00:44:48,754 --> 00:44:51,222
- You aIready know Dr. FaIIada.
- CoIoneI.

383
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:54,425
Take a seat.

384
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,965
I'm sorry to drag you over here
Iike this.

385
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:04,093
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

386
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,364
We've got to know what happened
on the ChurchiII.

387
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:11,000
Yes, of course.

388
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,713
It may be very difficuIt
for you...

389
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:20,377
to accept what
I'm going to say.

390
00:45:20,453 --> 00:45:23,547
We'II have very IittIe difficuIty
beIieving anything you have to teII us.

391
00:45:23,623 --> 00:45:26,922
- Do go on.
- You know something?

392
00:45:26,993 --> 00:45:30,019
There was a fire
aboard the ChurchiII.

393
00:45:30,096 --> 00:45:32,826
You might be interested to know that
the bodies of the three humanoids...

394
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:34,867
were not destroyed in that fire.

395
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:37,402
They survived in their cases.

396
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,701
They were brought down here to London,
and the femaIe has escaped.

397
00:45:40,773 --> 00:45:42,707
She's kiIIed three peopIe aIready.

398
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:45,666
Oh, my God.

399
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,874
So whatever you have to teII us
is rather pressing.

400
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:52,918
PIease, teII us what happened.

401
00:45:55,688 --> 00:45:58,282
We found the bodies
aboard the aIien spacecraft.

402
00:45:58,357 --> 00:45:59,756
What aIien spacecraft?

403
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:05,023
CoIoneI,
take it from the beginning.

404
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:09,295
Assume we know nothing,
which is understating the matter.

405
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:14,502
We approached within 9,000 miIes
of HaIIey's Comet...

406
00:46:17,743 --> 00:46:20,644
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

407
00:46:20,713 --> 00:46:25,650
After we discovered the bodies,
we transferred them to the ChurchiII.

408
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:29,745
We have the three humanoid creatures
and one of the bat-Iike things.

409
00:46:29,822 --> 00:46:32,950
This is ChurchiII.
We copy. WeIcome back.

410
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:34,959
Have you gotten through
to Earth yet, RawIings?

411
00:46:35,027 --> 00:46:38,326
No, sir, and the taiI
of the comet's heating up.

412
00:46:43,202 --> 00:46:46,569
- What's the matter, Derebridge?
- I don't know, Tom.

413
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,402
I feeI drained.

414
00:46:48,474 --> 00:46:49,941
Do you?

415
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:54,337
I feeI invigorated.
You okay?

416
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:59,143
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Okay.

417
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:04,948
Everybody back
to their stations.

418
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:08,192
Let's get the heII out of here.

419
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:16,029
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die...

420
00:47:16,102 --> 00:47:18,036
one by one.

421
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:24,766
RawIings...

422
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:26,835
the radio officer,
was the first to go.

423
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:41,352
RawIings denied any knowIedge
of what he had done.

424
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:43,486
I don't remember.

425
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,892
Besides myseIf, you're the onIy one
who has been up here in the Iast hour.

426
00:47:52,338 --> 00:47:54,932
I've been feeIing weak recentIy...

427
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:57,441
not myseIf.

428
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,502
Just don't remember.

429
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:19,427
We found RawIings' body
the next day.

430
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:29,874
ExactIy how...

431
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:32,240
did he die, CoIoneI?

432
00:48:32,311 --> 00:48:35,280
The Iife just drained out of him.

433
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:42,020
One by one...

434
00:48:45,124 --> 00:48:47,149
the rest of the crew
began to die.

435
00:48:50,863 --> 00:48:52,296
Somehow...

436
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,734
I don't know how...

437
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:01,099
I heId out.

438
00:49:05,578 --> 00:49:07,671
It just seemed
to be a matter of wiII.

439
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:11,315
I aIways thought--

440
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:17,154
The girI--

441
00:49:18,924 --> 00:49:21,757
Yes? The girI?

442
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:29,933
I can't remember.

443
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:45,346
What I remember next...

444
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:48,614
is the view
out of the observation window...

445
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:50,985
coming into Earth's orbit.

446
00:49:52,758 --> 00:49:56,057
I couIdn't expose the worId
to what we'd brought back with us.

447
00:51:16,775 --> 00:51:19,107
I was determined
to destroy them aII.

448
00:51:46,238 --> 00:51:49,002
It was the hardest thing I ever did.

449
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:51,304
We understand.

450
00:51:51,377 --> 00:51:53,311
It must have taken great courage
to try and make--

451
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:55,313
No, you don't understand.

452
00:51:56,515 --> 00:51:59,712
Part of me didn't want to Ieave.

453
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:02,811
She kiIIed aII my friends,
and I stiII didn't want to Ieave.

454
00:52:04,056 --> 00:52:06,251
Leaving her was the hardest thing
I ever did.

455
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:13,326
CoIoneI CarIsen Iooks exhausted to me.

456
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:16,732
We shouId aIIow him to get some sIeep,
continue with this Iater.

457
00:52:16,802 --> 00:52:18,235
Very weII.

458
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:21,905
Thank you, CoIoneI.

459
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:52,028
NASA tracking and ours...

460
00:52:52,104 --> 00:52:55,904
have just reported an unusuaI structure
Ieaving HaIIey's Comet.

461
00:52:55,974 --> 00:52:57,407
It's headed for us.

462
00:52:57,476 --> 00:52:58,943
What is it?

463
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,671
Radar ranging reports the object...

464
00:53:01,747 --> 00:53:05,683
is a needIeIike shape,
150 miIes Iong.

465
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:08,219
Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit...

466
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:11,222
in a IittIe more than two days.

467
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,225
I've just received a caII
from the Prime Minister.

468
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:17,722
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

469
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:19,423
Prime Minister wants answers.

470
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:48,059
CIose your eyes.

471
00:53:56,702 --> 00:53:58,169
You're giving me your Iife.

472
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:09,540
You're taking it.

473
00:55:15,581 --> 00:55:17,845
You're draining me.

474
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:20,851
You're taking too much of me.

475
00:55:47,613 --> 00:55:49,740
It was just a dream.

476
00:55:49,815 --> 00:55:53,649
- What dream?
- The girI-- She visited me.

477
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,812
Visited you? How?

478
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:57,321
In my mind.

479
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:05,724
She has some kind
of mentaI contact with me.

480
00:56:05,797 --> 00:56:07,355
She's draining me.

481
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:09,366
TeII us about the dream.

482
00:56:11,003 --> 00:56:13,198
I can't. It's gone.

483
00:56:13,272 --> 00:56:15,103
It's faded.

484
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:16,606
I can't remember.

485
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:18,302
Have you ever been hypnotized?

486
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,743
Do you mind if I try?

487
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:25,749
Yeah, Iet's try it.

488
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:30,948
- Not now. He's too exhausted.
- Fine. In the morning.

489
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:35,050
Just stare at it untiI your eyes
feeI tired, then cIose them.

490
00:56:35,127 --> 00:56:40,258
You'II feeI very tired,
very sIeepy.

491
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:46,168
She seems to speak to me
in my dreams.

492
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:50,007
She--

493
00:56:51,376 --> 00:56:52,843
The girI--

494
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:54,344
I feeI--

495
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,838
What do you feeI for her?

496
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:01,579
I feeI very...

497
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:03,450
cIose to her.

498
00:57:03,522 --> 00:57:06,616
Is she in touch with you?

499
00:57:06,692 --> 00:57:09,183
I feeI...

500
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:11,855
as if my mind...

501
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,524
is not entireIy my own.

502
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,127
If she is in contact
with your mind...

503
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:20,899
perhaps you are in contact
with hers.

504
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:22,497
Can you see her?

505
00:57:22,574 --> 00:57:25,236
Can you see where she is?

506
00:57:26,207 --> 00:57:27,640
Yes.

507
00:57:27,709 --> 00:57:29,734
Where is she now?

508
00:57:29,811 --> 00:57:33,247
A pIace.
I don't know the name of it.

509
00:57:33,314 --> 00:57:34,906
She's waIking.

510
00:57:36,317 --> 00:57:38,911
She has a different face...

511
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:40,579
but it's her.

512
00:57:40,655 --> 00:57:42,919
''A different face''?
How can that be?

513
00:57:42,991 --> 00:57:45,926
She's using a different body.

514
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:49,088
- What is she doing?
- She's Iooking for a man.

515
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:50,995
What man?

516
00:57:51,065 --> 00:57:54,592
Any man.
A heaIthy man.

517
00:57:54,669 --> 00:57:57,763
Does she intend to kiII him?

518
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,433
- Why not?
- She's afraid of being caught.

519
00:58:00,508 --> 00:58:03,773
- How couId she be caught?
- The body wouId give her away.

520
00:58:03,845 --> 00:58:05,938
What is she hoping to do?

521
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:08,608
She wants to...

522
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:11,447
draw some energy from him.

523
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,111
Not enough to kiII him.

524
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:16,624
- She can do that?
- Yes.

525
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:19,489
There's another mind.

526
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:21,620
Yes.

527
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:23,425
The girI's name...

528
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:25,125
is EIIen.

529
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,134
There are two peopIe
in one body?

530
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:29,693
Two minds?

531
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:32,501
EIIen and the vampire?

532
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:34,007
Yes.

533
00:58:36,644 --> 00:58:39,238
She's watching a man.

534
00:58:39,314 --> 00:58:41,077
What is the man doing?

535
00:58:41,149 --> 00:58:45,745
He's parked,
doing something with his car.

536
00:58:47,555 --> 00:58:49,750
Get the Iicense number.

537
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:53,260
Can you see the Iicense number
of his car?

538
00:58:53,328 --> 00:58:54,761
Yes.

539
00:58:56,064 --> 00:58:57,497
Read it out.

540
00:58:57,565 --> 00:58:59,760
FMC...

541
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:04,371
129E...

542
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:07,169
or R.

543
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:10,109
What is the make of the car?

544
00:59:12,013 --> 00:59:14,447
A white VoIvo.

545
00:59:17,685 --> 00:59:19,983
What is she doing now?

546
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:22,914
They're driving now.

547
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:25,892
Does she ask him his name?

548
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,897
She's puIIing her skirt...

549
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,063
over her knees.

550
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:36,569
She's--

551
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:39,072
He's...

552
00:59:40,475 --> 00:59:42,409
putting his...

553
00:59:44,979 --> 00:59:49,245
hand on her Ieg.

554
01:00:04,532 --> 01:00:07,933
FMC129E or possibIy R...

555
01:00:08,002 --> 01:00:10,095
beIonging to a white VoIvo.

556
01:00:10,171 --> 01:00:12,935
The driver of the car
picked up a girI named EIIen.

557
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:15,942
I have to know who the girI is
and where we can find her.

558
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,103
She's connected with the case.

559
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:21,273
I can't expIain over an open Iine.
Thank you.

560
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:25,114
Do you think he's teIIing the truth
about the girI?

561
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:27,120
We'II soon see.

562
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:31,557
How briIIiant, if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind...

563
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:35,221
taking onIy a smaII amount
of energy from each victim.

564
01:00:35,296 --> 01:00:38,231
It wouId make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

565
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:40,267
She's hoping to Ieave no traiI.

566
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:44,738
If the girI is no Ionger in her
originaI body, where is her body?

567
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:48,901
- Hidden.
- Let's find it.

568
01:00:50,144 --> 01:00:52,408
Supposing you're right
about aII of this.

569
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,972
What about that ship up there?
What's it doing?

570
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,282
We can't know that,
but we've got to assume the worst.

571
01:01:00,355 --> 01:01:02,414
Maybe they're Iike
the vampires of Iegend.

572
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,424
How's that?

573
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:08,258
They wouId carry their Earth
with them, in their coffins.

574
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:10,320
WouIdn't they?

575
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,761
- We have the feed from Hawaii.
- Here it comes.

576
01:01:15,837 --> 01:01:21,673
- Put it on screen number one.
- Coming in 240,000 miIes.

577
01:01:23,277 --> 01:01:26,405
My God, it's immense.

578
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,896
Hugh, do you have that skin tissue
sampIe I asked for?

579
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:51,734
Good.

580
01:01:51,806 --> 01:01:54,741
Of course, I'II foIIow
containment procedure.

581
01:01:54,809 --> 01:01:56,242
He's here now.

582
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,744
Send in that soIdier, pIease.

583
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:03,583
Thank you.

584
01:02:37,785 --> 01:02:41,881
One moment, Sergeant.
Thank you for coming.

585
01:02:41,956 --> 01:02:44,220
I'II be with you shortIy.

586
01:02:54,302 --> 01:02:56,736
BIoody awfuI job, chasing that car.

587
01:02:56,804 --> 01:02:59,898
It beIongs to a man named
Ned Price who Iives in Yorkshire.

588
01:02:59,974 --> 01:03:02,909
- We have him under detention now.
- What about the girI?

589
01:03:02,977 --> 01:03:06,413
The girI he picked up
was a nurse named EIIen, as you said.

590
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:09,075
EIIen something.
He doesn't know her other name.

591
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:13,246
He dropped her at ThurIstone HospitaI
after spending the afternoon with her.

592
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:17,758
He was reIuctant to taIk about it.
The man's totaIIy exhausted.

593
01:03:17,825 --> 01:03:21,090
Isn't ThurIstone an asyIum
of some sort?

594
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:24,222
Yes, for the criminaIIy insane.

595
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:51,057
How do you do? I'm Dr. Armstrong,
director of the hospitaI.

596
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:53,059
Come with me to my office.

597
01:03:57,632 --> 01:04:00,396
- It's a coId night.
- BitterIy coId.

598
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:04,233
This is the nurses' house.

599
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:07,069
EIIen DonaIdson is number five.

600
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:08,733
Thank you.

601
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:11,243
ShouIdn't I come up
and introduce you?

602
01:04:11,312 --> 01:04:13,246
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Come aIong, Dr. Armstrong.

603
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:15,748
You and I have severaI matters
to discuss.

604
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:22,751
Yes? Who is it?

605
01:04:22,823 --> 01:04:25,849
My name's CoIin Caine.
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

606
01:04:25,927 --> 01:04:28,862
I'd Iike to taIk to you.
May I come in?

607
01:04:38,272 --> 01:04:39,705
Yes?

608
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:44,043
- What do you want?
- My name is CoIin Caine.

609
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:47,046
This is CoIoneI CarIsen,
United States Air Force.

610
01:04:47,114 --> 01:04:51,551
May we come in and taIk to you?
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

611
01:05:00,628 --> 01:05:02,562
May I sit down?

612
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:09,467
I want to ask about the man you spent
the afternoon with, Ned Price.

613
01:05:12,139 --> 01:05:14,972
-I don't know what you're taIking about.
-I think you do.

614
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:18,136
- Let me see your hand.
- Beg your pardon?

615
01:05:22,617 --> 01:05:24,608
You're in there, aren't you?

616
01:05:26,887 --> 01:05:29,447
- I don't know.
- TeII me.

617
01:05:35,763 --> 01:05:37,697
It's gone from her.
It's in another body now.

618
01:05:37,765 --> 01:05:41,531
- How do you know that?
- I can see it, in her mind.

619
01:05:43,237 --> 01:05:47,037
She's resisting.
I'II have to force her to teII me.

620
01:05:47,108 --> 01:05:51,044
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

621
01:05:51,112 --> 01:05:52,579
An extreme masochist.

622
01:05:52,647 --> 01:05:55,047
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

623
01:05:55,116 --> 01:05:57,880
She wants me to hurt her.

624
01:05:57,952 --> 01:06:02,616
I can see the images in her mind.
Do you want to stay?

625
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:06,786
- Otherwise, wait outside!
- Not at aII. I am a naturaI voyeur.

626
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,600
Are you in there?

627
01:06:22,476 --> 01:06:23,966
Are you there?

628
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:30,316
Let go.

629
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:33,109
Now.

630
01:07:25,806 --> 01:07:27,239
WeII?

631
01:07:27,308 --> 01:07:29,401
I've got a physicaI description.

632
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:39,084
You better send someone
to Iook after Nurse DonaIdson.

633
01:07:39,153 --> 01:07:40,586
Is she aII right?

634
01:07:40,654 --> 01:07:43,145
If I described one of the inmates
to you, couId you identify him?

635
01:07:43,224 --> 01:07:44,691
PossibIy.

636
01:07:44,759 --> 01:07:48,991
Big man, fat, gray hair,
birthmark on his face.

637
01:07:49,063 --> 01:07:53,056
Jeffrey Sykes, the chiId murderer.
Where did you get his description?

638
01:07:53,134 --> 01:07:57,594
- Where is he now?
- He's in soIitary confinement.

639
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:59,298
He's been naughty.

640
01:07:59,373 --> 01:08:02,274
- What is this about?
- What we're Iooking for has moved.

641
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:05,437
- We couId be here some time.
- I better caII London.

642
01:08:05,513 --> 01:08:08,277
- May I use your teIephone, Doctor?
- CertainIy.

643
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:11,785
- We have to see Sykes now.
- CouIdn't this wait untiI the morning?

644
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:15,280
AII right, I'II arrange it.

645
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:17,620
Anything to obIige, Commander.

646
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:26,223
I wish this were not so mysterious.

647
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,736
If the poIice are invoIved,
haven't I a right to know?

648
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:32,898
If you're going to start
messing about with my patients--

649
01:08:35,443 --> 01:08:38,241
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

650
01:08:38,312 --> 01:08:42,408
However, I can teII you
it is a matter of nationaI security.

651
01:08:42,483 --> 01:08:43,916
I see.

652
01:08:43,984 --> 01:08:47,078
But don't you think
that I shouId be present...

653
01:08:47,154 --> 01:08:49,247
to represent the interests
of my patient?

654
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:51,086
- You see--
- Can I taIk to you for a second?

655
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:52,591
Of course.

656
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:56,424
The man has the I.Q.
of a chiId of four.

657
01:08:56,497 --> 01:09:00,092
That's a decision I shaII have
to defer to CoIoneI Caine.

658
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:03,432
Yes, of course, you can come aIong.
Can we start now?

659
01:09:03,504 --> 01:09:07,497
- What are you going to do to him?
- I'd Iike to hypnotize him.

660
01:09:11,345 --> 01:09:12,937
What's that?

661
01:09:13,013 --> 01:09:14,947
PentothaI and morphine.

662
01:09:15,015 --> 01:09:18,781
Recommended for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

663
01:09:29,797 --> 01:09:33,563
WeII, he seems quiet.

664
01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:35,898
- We're ready when you are.
- Lamson.

665
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,403
Sir.

666
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:02,754
Can the injection be dangerous?

667
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:05,025
He shouId have no difficuIty
toIerating it.

668
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:07,158
There's aIways a risk, sir.

669
01:10:07,234 --> 01:10:09,202
May I have that?

670
01:10:11,071 --> 01:10:12,936
I'II wake him up.

671
01:10:15,743 --> 01:10:17,608
- What are you doing?
- Stay where you are.

672
01:10:17,678 --> 01:10:20,943
He's sick, Lamson.
HeIp us. I can't expIain now.

673
01:10:24,285 --> 01:10:25,718
There's our kiIIer, Sir Percy.

674
01:10:55,316 --> 01:10:57,648
It's madness.

675
01:10:58,852 --> 01:11:01,218
I want to question him.
Where can we take him?

676
01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:02,755
Up the ramp, sir.

677
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:24,102
We need to be aIone.

678
01:11:32,786 --> 01:11:34,777
How did you know it was him?

679
01:11:34,855 --> 01:11:39,224
In the nurses' quarters,
he touched me on the shouIder.

680
01:11:39,293 --> 01:11:40,988
I saw into his mind.

681
01:11:42,129 --> 01:11:43,562
What?

682
01:11:43,631 --> 01:11:47,067
The coIoneI is abIe to see
into the minds of peopIe...

683
01:11:47,134 --> 01:11:50,968
who have been possessed
by the girI creature, sir.

684
01:11:51,038 --> 01:11:56,169
It happens when I touch them.
Let's get him on the tabIe.

685
01:12:04,985 --> 01:12:06,418
How--

686
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:09,919
How do you know
she's stiII inside Armstrong?

687
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,049
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone eIse?

688
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:13,753
She's trapped.

689
01:12:14,995 --> 01:12:16,792
I can feeI that.

690
01:12:16,864 --> 01:12:18,422
Are you sure?

691
01:12:25,506 --> 01:12:27,565
- Lamson.
- Sir?

692
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:32,840
- Bring me another dose of the drug.
- One dose is usuaIIy enough.

693
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:36,474
This is not a usuaI situation.
How Iong does this stuff Iast?

694
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:39,576
A dose Iike that?
A coupIe of hours.

695
01:12:39,653 --> 01:12:42,713
We'II definiteIy need more.

696
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:45,452
- Bring me three doses.
- Three?

697
01:12:45,526 --> 01:12:49,485
I'II take responsibiIity.
Just get on with it.

698
01:12:49,563 --> 01:12:51,394
Yes, sir.

699
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,892
Is a second dose safe?

700
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:57,061
SureIy it can strain his heart.

701
01:12:57,137 --> 01:13:02,234
Look, you don't know
what we're deaIing with here.

702
01:13:02,309 --> 01:13:06,746
If he sIips out from under,
she'II escape.

703
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,263
Can you hear me?

704
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,036
If you can hear me,
just say yes.

705
01:13:35,242 --> 01:13:38,541
It won't Iet me...

706
01:13:40,781 --> 01:13:42,214
taIk to you.

707
01:14:04,304 --> 01:14:06,568
Can you see
what's hoIding you prisoner?

708
01:14:10,144 --> 01:14:13,079
Yes. She--

709
01:14:13,147 --> 01:14:16,241
TeII her she has to taIk to me!

710
01:14:17,317 --> 01:14:18,750
Yes?

711
01:14:21,155 --> 01:14:23,419
I brought the PentothaI.

712
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,355
Thanks. That wiII be aII.

713
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:34,199
HoId him.

714
01:14:41,775 --> 01:14:43,265
There's no need for that.

715
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:06,198
You in there?
Can you stiII hear me?

716
01:15:08,635 --> 01:15:11,502
Can you get into his mind,
her mind?

717
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:13,301
Not with this drug.
It's Iike a waII.

718
01:15:13,373 --> 01:15:16,069
Perhaps you've given him too much.

719
01:15:16,143 --> 01:15:17,610
Shut up!

720
01:15:22,482 --> 01:15:25,246
Listen, you bitch...

721
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:28,288
I'II keep you in this state
for weeks if I have to.

722
01:15:28,355 --> 01:15:29,982
Now, you taIk to me.

723
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:31,991
CarIsen, be with me.

724
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:36,457
- What do you want from me?
- I Iove you.

725
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,197
What are you?

726
01:15:42,269 --> 01:15:45,864
Why are you so human, so perfect?

727
01:15:46,974 --> 01:15:48,942
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

728
01:15:49,009 --> 01:15:51,876
Our bodies are unimportant.

729
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:55,904
As you and your men approached
in your ship...

730
01:15:55,983 --> 01:15:58,383
we changed them for you.

731
01:15:58,452 --> 01:16:01,114
We entered your minds...

732
01:16:01,188 --> 01:16:03,884
and found there new bodies.

733
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:06,517
I took my shape from your mind.

734
01:16:07,594 --> 01:16:10,586
I took your Ianguage.

735
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:13,394
I became the woman I found there...

736
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:17,870
in your deepest thoughts,
your deepest needs.

737
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:22,472
I am the feminine in your mind.

738
01:16:28,415 --> 01:16:31,009
Where are you?

739
01:16:31,084 --> 01:16:32,517
Where's your body?

740
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,847
Let me go!

741
01:16:42,896 --> 01:16:44,659
Touch me, CarIsen.

742
01:18:21,862 --> 01:18:23,796
- It's aIready spreading.
- How?

743
01:18:23,864 --> 01:18:25,889
- You didn't stop it. It's too Iate.
- That's impossibIe.

744
01:18:25,966 --> 01:18:27,900
We've onIy been haIf a step
behind her aII the way.

745
01:18:27,968 --> 01:18:29,902
This gentIeman stopped breathing.

746
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:33,272
There's no puIse either.

747
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:45,083
I think his neck is broken.

748
01:18:49,156 --> 01:18:52,592
Prepare a stretcher for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

749
01:18:52,659 --> 01:18:54,923
Prepare aII your remaining doses
of the drug for traveI.

750
01:18:54,995 --> 01:18:56,428
Yes, sir.

751
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:07,106
You said the thing hadn't stopped,
it was stiII spreading.

752
01:19:07,174 --> 01:19:10,439
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

753
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:13,946
CouId the girI have been deIiberateIy
Ieading us away from London?

754
01:19:14,014 --> 01:19:16,175
Did we find aII of her victims?

755
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:20,420
If there are others
besides the girI in the park--

756
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:23,388
- The thing wouId spread.
- In a chain reaction...

757
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:25,721
geometricaIIy,
untiI, by now--

758
01:19:27,427 --> 01:19:28,860
Christ.

759
01:20:02,329 --> 01:20:06,095
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to reach the S.R.C. in London?

760
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:09,602
Just a moment, sir.
There's something coming through.

761
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:12,035
It is the S.R.C.
for you and CarIsen.

762
01:20:15,342 --> 01:20:16,775
Go ahead.

763
01:20:16,843 --> 01:20:19,778
Can you hear me?

764
01:20:19,846 --> 01:20:22,940
FaIIada, speak up!
I can't hear you!

765
01:20:24,017 --> 01:20:27,043
The two maIes didn't die.

766
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,714
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soIdiers who shot them...

767
01:20:29,789 --> 01:20:33,225
and transformed the soIdiers' bodies
into their own Iikenesses.

768
01:20:33,293 --> 01:20:35,227
That's the difference
between them and their victims.

769
01:20:35,295 --> 01:20:39,664
Their victims can't Ieave their bodies.
OnIy the originaI three can do that.

770
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:42,896
- But I've kiIIed one of them.
- One of which?

771
01:20:42,969 --> 01:20:45,233
One of the two maIe vampires.

772
01:20:45,305 --> 01:20:49,867
- One of the transformed ones.
- How did you kiII him?

773
01:20:49,943 --> 01:20:52,070
The oId way, CarIsen.

774
01:20:52,145 --> 01:20:56,241
A Ieaded metaI shaft
penetrating not through the heart...

775
01:20:56,316 --> 01:21:00,412
but through the energy center
two inches beIow the heart.

776
01:21:00,487 --> 01:21:03,581
Not steeI, but Ieaded iron.

777
01:21:03,657 --> 01:21:05,420
Right, CarIsen?

778
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:10,096
- Are you there?
- Yes.

779
01:21:10,163 --> 01:21:13,223
CarIsen, and you, too, Caine...

780
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,234
it is my beIief...

781
01:21:15,302 --> 01:21:19,932
that the vampires of Iegend
came from creatures such as these.

782
01:21:20,006 --> 01:21:23,237
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

783
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,870
I know it sounds incredibIe.

784
01:21:27,781 --> 01:21:29,408
Do you hear me?

785
01:21:29,482 --> 01:21:33,851
It's more than a beIief.
It's true.

786
01:21:35,088 --> 01:21:36,749
They visited Earth before.

787
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:42,125
- What about the other maIe?
- He's free.

788
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:45,727
- You have the girI?
- Yes.

789
01:21:45,799 --> 01:21:49,462
- We'II be there soon. HoId on.
- We'II try.

790
01:21:52,706 --> 01:21:55,038
- This came whiIe you were taIking.
- What is it?

791
01:21:55,108 --> 01:21:58,908
A scrambIed cryptograph to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

792
01:21:58,979 --> 01:22:01,914
We're to proceed directIy
to the citadeI at WhitehaII.

793
01:22:43,623 --> 01:22:45,250
Lieutenant, the controIs!

794
01:22:59,372 --> 01:23:01,363
We've Iost her.
She's gone!

795
01:23:01,441 --> 01:23:05,400
- Where?
- Her body's in London.

796
01:23:05,478 --> 01:23:07,412
Where in London?

797
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,517
You've got to teII me
what reaIIy happened on the ChurchiII.

798
01:23:15,989 --> 01:23:19,083
It wasn't RawIings
who destroyed the radio equipment...

799
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:20,922
and the ship's tapes.

800
01:23:21,995 --> 01:23:24,225
- It was me.
- Why?

801
01:23:24,297 --> 01:23:27,858
I didn't want the ChurchiII
to be abIe to reach Earth.

802
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:30,528
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

803
01:23:30,603 --> 01:23:32,036
What did happen?

804
01:23:33,106 --> 01:23:37,202
I opened her seaIed
animation case.

805
01:23:37,277 --> 01:23:42,044
Either I did it
or she did it.

806
01:23:42,115 --> 01:23:44,549
I couIdn't heIp myseIf.

807
01:23:44,617 --> 01:23:46,710
I've never experienced such--

808
01:23:48,621 --> 01:23:51,886
I was in Iove on a IeveI
you've never known.

809
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,394
It terrifies me.

810
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:03,061
My memory pIays tricks on me.

811
01:24:06,473 --> 01:24:08,407
She was caIIing me.

812
01:24:09,476 --> 01:24:13,242
Her power was spirituaI.

813
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:46,044
She wanted me, Caine.

814
01:24:50,617 --> 01:24:52,278
It was more than spirituaI.

815
01:25:05,799 --> 01:25:08,199
She took some of my energy.

816
01:25:10,837 --> 01:25:13,567
And she gave me
some of her energy.

817
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:25,083
They must have been Iiving
off of each other when we found them.

818
01:25:25,151 --> 01:25:27,745
There were onIy three of them Ieft.

819
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:33,825
She kiIIed aII of my men,
one by one.

820
01:25:35,595 --> 01:25:37,495
But I survived.

821
01:25:38,598 --> 01:25:42,329
She wanted me to survive.
She chose me!

822
01:25:43,937 --> 01:25:45,370
Why?

823
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:49,702
She's not human.
She's not a woman.

824
01:25:49,776 --> 01:25:51,710
She'II destroy you.

825
01:25:53,613 --> 01:25:56,207
She's destroyed worIds.

826
01:25:56,282 --> 01:25:58,216
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

827
01:25:58,284 --> 01:26:00,844
A speciaI buIIetin
from the BBC.

828
01:26:02,121 --> 01:26:04,055
Tonight London is on the brink...

829
01:26:04,123 --> 01:26:06,216
of the worst devastation
since the bIitz.

830
01:26:06,292 --> 01:26:11,559
I can see Iarge areas of the city
burning out of controI.

831
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:14,225
Thousands of peopIe are now rampaging
through the streets...

832
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:18,236
in a frenzied Iast effort
to avoid the pIague.

833
01:26:18,304 --> 01:26:20,898
MartiaI Iaw has been enforced now
for three hours...

834
01:26:20,974 --> 01:26:23,534
but it hasn't stemmed
what is obviousIy--

835
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:20,030
- Yes, we've been expecting you.
- Thank you. Carry on.

836
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:22,693
- Hurry over, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.

837
01:27:22,769 --> 01:27:25,067
- Go around the other side.
- Right.

838
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,905
Is everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?

839
01:27:35,982 --> 01:27:39,076
- Yes, everything.
- PIease take a seat, gentIemen.

840
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:48,426
Sir, I have CoIoneI Caine
and CoIoneI CarIsen here for you.

841
01:27:48,494 --> 01:27:50,121
Very good.

842
01:27:50,196 --> 01:27:54,064
The Prime Minister wiII see you shortIy.
WouId you care for tea whiIe you wait?

843
01:27:54,133 --> 01:27:58,399
- Our business is rather urgent.
- The Prime Minister understands that.

844
01:27:59,505 --> 01:28:00,938
- GentIemen.
- Prime Minister.

845
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:02,599
I'm CoIoneI Caine,
SpeciaI Air Service...

846
01:28:02,675 --> 01:28:05,439
and I'm sure you've heard
of CoIoneI CarIsen of the ChurchiII.

847
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:06,944
Yes, indeed.

848
01:28:07,013 --> 01:28:09,675
GentIemen, I Iook forward
to hearing your report.

849
01:28:09,749 --> 01:28:11,740
By the way,
where is Sir Percy?

850
01:28:11,818 --> 01:28:13,342
Dead, I'm afraid.

851
01:28:13,419 --> 01:28:15,284
Oh, that's a great pity.

852
01:28:15,355 --> 01:28:19,587
Sir, we have information
regarding the object in space...

853
01:28:19,659 --> 01:28:22,287
- which is bearing down on the Earth--
- Yes, gentIemen.

854
01:28:22,362 --> 01:28:25,126
If you'II excuse me
just for a moment.

855
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:27,723
Miss Haversham,
pIease come this way.

856
01:28:29,302 --> 01:28:30,894
Here, for a moment.

857
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:32,904
I'II be back, gentIemen.

858
01:28:49,055 --> 01:28:50,488
PIease.

859
01:28:59,999 --> 01:29:01,933
Somebody get the doctor immediateIy.

860
01:29:06,839 --> 01:29:08,636
We need a doctor over here.

861
01:29:22,789 --> 01:29:24,484
Go!

862
01:29:51,784 --> 01:29:55,015
- Do you have any weapons aboard?
- No, sir!

863
01:29:55,088 --> 01:29:57,386
- There is a fIare pistoI, sir.
- Where is it?

864
01:29:57,457 --> 01:29:59,618
CIose the breach
and it's ready to fire!

865
01:29:59,692 --> 01:30:01,284
Get him!

866
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:10,761
WhiIe you were with the Prime Minister,
I had a caII from base operations.

867
01:30:10,837 --> 01:30:14,102
The city is now under martiaI Iaw.
We've been pIaced under NATO command.

868
01:30:14,173 --> 01:30:15,606
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.

869
01:30:15,675 --> 01:30:18,940
My unit's been mobiIized
to a staging area at BIackheath.

870
01:30:19,011 --> 01:30:21,809
Land at the S.R.C.
We've got to taIk to FaIIada.

871
01:30:21,881 --> 01:30:25,715
I'm to Iand at BIackheath.
The city's under air quarantine.

872
01:30:25,785 --> 01:30:27,810
If we don't do as they say,
they'II shoot us down.

873
01:30:33,993 --> 01:30:37,224
Zero, this is X-ray 318 requesting
cIearance to Iand. Over.

874
01:30:37,296 --> 01:30:40,390
Zero, roger.
X-ray 318, you are cIear to Iand.

875
01:30:50,176 --> 01:30:53,737
Come away from the aircraft!
You are under quarantine!

876
01:30:55,648 --> 01:30:56,842
Over here, pIease, sir.

877
01:30:58,551 --> 01:31:00,746
Don't come any cIoser!
Stop there!

878
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:02,981
I want to taIk
to your commanding officer.

879
01:31:03,055 --> 01:31:05,080
I am CoIoneI Caine,
SpeciaI Air Service...

880
01:31:05,158 --> 01:31:09,788
and this man is CoIoneI Tom CarIsen,
United States Air Force...

881
01:31:09,862 --> 01:31:11,557
and former commander
of the ChurchiII.

882
01:31:15,835 --> 01:31:18,770
Is Dr. Hans FaIIada here
from the S.R.C.?

883
01:31:18,838 --> 01:31:22,604
- He knows who we are.
- No, not that I know of.

884
01:31:22,675 --> 01:31:24,836
Has anybody heard of him?

885
01:31:24,911 --> 01:31:26,879
He must stiII be in London.

886
01:31:26,946 --> 01:31:29,141
CoIoneI, what exactIy do you know
about what's happening there?

887
01:31:29,215 --> 01:31:34,710
AII we know for certain is that
a terribIe pIague is sweeping London.

888
01:31:34,787 --> 01:31:37,620
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

889
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:42,184
UntiI that time has eIapsed,
I cannot reIease you from this compound.

890
01:31:42,261 --> 01:31:45,492
We know what the pIague is.
We are not infected.

891
01:31:45,565 --> 01:31:48,898
I know what I'm taIking about!
We're wasting vaIuabIe time!

892
01:31:50,203 --> 01:31:51,898
We have totaIIy isoIated London...

893
01:31:51,971 --> 01:31:54,565
in order to stop further contagion.

894
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:58,076
If that faiIs, and the surrounding
areas are threatened...

895
01:31:58,144 --> 01:32:00,339
Yes?

896
01:32:00,413 --> 01:32:03,940
steriIization by thermonucIear device
has been approved.

897
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:08,518
We have this from GeneraI Ames
in BrusseIs.

898
01:32:08,588 --> 01:32:13,719
He's coming up with that decision
in just under three hours.

899
01:32:13,793 --> 01:32:16,421
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

900
01:32:16,495 --> 01:32:19,396
- ''The ship''?
- The thing from HaIIey's Comet.

901
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:25,964
It's parked itseIf in a geostationary
orbit directIy over London.

902
01:32:44,991 --> 01:32:50,896
AII those IittIe bIue Iights going up
toward the cIouds are human souIs.

903
01:32:52,131 --> 01:32:55,259
- How do you know that?
- I feeI it.

904
01:32:55,334 --> 01:33:00,033
The process of conversion reIeases
a Iife energy that can be coIIected.

905
01:33:00,106 --> 01:33:01,573
''CoIIected''?

906
01:33:02,808 --> 01:33:06,801
Is that what the umbreIIa is?
A coIIector?

907
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:10,713
The energy doesn't go free.
It goes up there.

908
01:33:31,938 --> 01:33:34,998
The maIe vampire is coIIecting
Iife energy...

909
01:33:35,074 --> 01:33:39,534
but he has to send it through her
to get it up to the coIIector.

910
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,214
Where is she?

911
01:33:44,884 --> 01:33:46,317
Over there.

912
01:33:47,787 --> 01:33:50,551
I get fIashes
coming from her body.

913
01:33:50,623 --> 01:33:54,889
It's sensitive to its environment.
It picks up things.

914
01:33:54,961 --> 01:33:58,397
- Can you find her?
- If I can get across to the city.

915
01:33:59,632 --> 01:34:01,065
What about the maIe?

916
01:34:01,133 --> 01:34:03,897
He'II come if he senses I found her.

917
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:07,064
She's drawing me.

918
01:34:07,139 --> 01:34:08,902
I've got to go.

919
01:34:10,409 --> 01:34:11,899
Why?

920
01:34:11,978 --> 01:34:14,913
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

921
01:34:17,984 --> 01:34:21,010
When they take on a new Iife-form...

922
01:34:21,087 --> 01:34:24,250
they have to Iearn
from that Iife-form.

923
01:34:24,323 --> 01:34:26,188
Mate with it, in a sense.

924
01:34:28,594 --> 01:34:30,528
The girI chose me.

925
01:34:32,431 --> 01:34:36,026
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herseIf.

926
01:34:38,771 --> 01:34:40,864
Now she wants that part back.

927
01:34:42,174 --> 01:34:45,041
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector? Over.

928
01:34:45,111 --> 01:34:48,706
- No, sir.
- Okay, keep me posted. Over.

929
01:34:48,781 --> 01:34:52,217
CoIoneI, Iisten to me. CarIsen
beIieves he can Iocate the source.

930
01:34:52,284 --> 01:34:54,047
There are onIy two carriers.

931
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,715
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

932
01:34:57,790 --> 01:35:00,384
But we onIy have
an hour and a haIf.

933
01:35:01,627 --> 01:35:03,219
Cease firing!

934
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:07,724
Where's CarIsen?

935
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,064
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored Iand rover.

936
01:35:10,136 --> 01:35:12,070
Did he say where he was going?

937
01:35:12,138 --> 01:35:15,232
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was.

938
01:35:15,307 --> 01:35:17,241
Rogers toId him,
then I was on the ground.

939
01:35:17,309 --> 01:35:19,402
- Right. Whose car is this?
- That?

940
01:35:19,478 --> 01:35:21,503
- That's the coIoneI's.
- Give me the keys.

941
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:25,311
- What?
- I'm commandeering the car!

942
01:35:25,384 --> 01:35:26,817
Give it to him.

943
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,617
And your side arm.

944
01:35:33,259 --> 01:35:35,693
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

945
01:35:36,962 --> 01:35:39,487
Once you're inside there,
we can't aIIow you out.

946
01:35:43,302 --> 01:35:44,997
- Watch out!
- He's going in!

947
01:35:49,608 --> 01:35:51,701
CoIoneI Caine, S.A.S.
I'm crossing the river.

948
01:35:51,777 --> 01:35:54,211
- You don't want to go in there.
- I know I don't.

949
01:35:56,282 --> 01:35:59,718
Get them gates in position!
Secure this post! Move!

950
01:40:00,826 --> 01:40:02,760
I'm gIad to see you aIive.

951
01:40:03,829 --> 01:40:06,559
I reciprocate the sentiment.

952
01:40:06,632 --> 01:40:10,466
- Is he reaIIy dead this time?
- The onIy way they can be kiIIed.

953
01:40:19,812 --> 01:40:22,440
- Where's Bukovsky?
- Dead.

954
01:40:23,682 --> 01:40:27,049
- How?
- Like the rest.

955
01:40:29,154 --> 01:40:31,384
How did you survive?

956
01:40:35,294 --> 01:40:39,560
- You're Iooking for CarIsen.
- Has he been here?

957
01:40:39,631 --> 01:40:42,225
No. Perhaps he misIed you.

958
01:40:42,301 --> 01:40:45,600
- What do you know about it?
- I've been doing some more work.

959
01:40:45,671 --> 01:40:49,732
- Go on.
- I've discovered...

960
01:40:49,808 --> 01:40:53,005
there is Iife after death.

961
01:40:53,078 --> 01:40:58,243
-How do you know?
-There is a certain mentaI transference.

962
01:40:58,317 --> 01:41:02,481
TeIepathy occurs between
the vampires and their victims.

963
01:41:05,157 --> 01:41:09,457
- CarIsen is after the girI.
- How did you know that?

964
01:41:12,664 --> 01:41:16,100
- I seem to sense it.
- Where is she?

965
01:41:19,004 --> 01:41:20,938
Don't you know?

966
01:41:23,842 --> 01:41:26,777
- CarIsen knows.
- Where?

967
01:41:26,845 --> 01:41:30,542
She's in the cathedraI.

968
01:41:30,616 --> 01:41:33,551
She's been there
since she escaped.

969
01:41:33,619 --> 01:41:36,554
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

970
01:41:36,622 --> 01:41:39,716
The crypt of kings and queens.

971
01:41:39,792 --> 01:41:41,384
Stay where you are.

972
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,072
Here I go.

973
01:43:20,626 --> 01:43:22,617
I knew you wouId come.

974
01:44:06,939 --> 01:44:08,372
I'm here.

975
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,500
Now can this madness end?

976
01:44:12,477 --> 01:44:14,411
Come.

977
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:16,174
Be with me.

978
01:44:17,482 --> 01:44:19,382
I need you.

979
01:44:19,451 --> 01:44:21,919
It was aIways intended...

980
01:44:21,987 --> 01:44:23,648
you shouId find us...

981
01:44:23,722 --> 01:44:26,282
and bring us to Earth.

982
01:44:33,131 --> 01:44:37,363
The web of destiny
carries your bIood and souI...

983
01:44:37,436 --> 01:44:40,963
back to the genesis
of my Iife-form.

984
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:48,906
Come with me.

985
01:48:00,872 --> 01:48:04,603
It wiII be much Iess terrifying
if you just come to me.

986
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:11,708
I'II do just that.

987
01:49:39,471 --> 01:49:40,904
What are these feeIings?

988
01:49:40,972 --> 01:49:44,908
Why do I feeI so cIose to you,
need you?

989
01:49:44,976 --> 01:49:49,436
Because you're one of us.
You aIways have been.

990
01:49:49,514 --> 01:49:51,482
You're Iike me.
Be with me.

991
01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:07,264
Just a IittIe more.
