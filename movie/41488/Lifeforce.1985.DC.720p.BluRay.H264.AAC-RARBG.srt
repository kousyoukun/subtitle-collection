1
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:45,555
August 9, 2:30 p.m.
Greenwich Mean Time.

2
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:47,890
The H.M.S. Churchill,
outward bound.

3
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:50,762
On board: a joint
British-American space team.

4
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:55,202
Their mission: to intercept and study
the comet bearing Dr. Hailey's name.

5
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:59,206
The Churchill is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.

6
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:02,072
It propels the Churchill
with constant acceleration...

7
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:05,808
enough to create Earth-type gravity for
the first time on an extended flight.

8
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:10,183
The Churchill is on course
for its rendezvous.

9
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:13,017
- Sir, this is odd.
- What?

10
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:14,648
I'm getting a small radar
cross section...

11
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:17,888
just ahead of the nucleus
in the coma of the comet.

12
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,193
I've got it too. Check the length.
It's at the limit of my scan angle.

13
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,360
- What's going on?
- You run an equipment check?

14
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,061
Every five minutes.

15
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:29,038
- Radar states 150 miles.
- 150 miles what?

16
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,041
- Length.
- 150 miles long?

17
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:35,071
What's 150 miles long?

18
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:36,806
It's a radar trace.

19
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,407
- Something in the coma of the comet.
- Show me.

20
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:43,887
- E.G.R. is confirmed.
- Looks good.

21
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,389
E.G.R. is optimal.

22
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,013
Track three on three.

23
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,525
Roger.

24
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:51,528
What's its height?

25
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:54,896
I've got a vertical reading
of two miles at least.

26
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,334
Ambient temperature: six degrees.

27
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:59,769
Less than two percent traces
of manganese, titanium--

28
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:01,271
Try and raise base.

29
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:04,174
Tell them we have an artificial
object out here hidden--

30
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:08,010
- Are you sure you want to say "hidden"?
- It's located in the head of the comet.

31
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,844
Keep sending that
until they acknowledge.

32
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,680
Use a secured downlink.

33
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:15,778
Sorry, Commander, everything's
been swamped by the coma winds.

34
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:17,915
We can't get anything back to base.

35
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:20,016
How long is the blackout period?

36
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:22,120
all the way.

37
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,206
What are you gonna do?

38
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:37,710
Go on in.

39
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:42,345
We're only gonna get one chance,
Derebridge.

40
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:47,380
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years...

41
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:50,049
and we'll both be dead.

42
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:52,217
We have to take a look now.

43
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:05,269
- Shut down Nerva.
- Shutting down.

44
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:07,173
Down.

45
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:22,024
- Solar panels retracted.
- Check. Give me a readout, Bob.

46
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,728
Executing E.V.A. maneuver.

47
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:15,506
Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

48
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,784
- Was it exploring the comet?
- Come on, guys, let's do it.

49
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,182
The surface looks badly pitted.

50
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,352
In that case,
it's been here a long time.

51
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,520
It's derelict, whatever it is.

52
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,690
Stand by, Churchill.
We're going in.

53
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,032
Roger, Carlsen.
We copy. We have you going in.

54
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:44,205
Churchill, it looks like
some giant artery, organic.

55
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,043
I almost have the feeling
I've been here before.

56
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,883
Oh, boy.

57
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:01,995
This is incredible.

58
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:05,329
I hope you can appreciate
the scale of this on the video.

59
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,996
Roger. We're getting it.
It's all on tape.

60
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:13,440
Oh, shit.

61
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,502
Whoa. Here they are.

62
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:26,655
Churchill...

63
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:29,785
it looks like we found the occupants
of the ship.

64
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:35,096
They look like giant bats.

65
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:49,974
- There must be hundreds of them.
- Thousands.

66
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:52,311
Dead, I hope.

67
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,491
Looks prehistoric.

68
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:20,378
It's completely desiccated.

69
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:29,614
- Crumbles.
- Yes, it would.

70
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:32,921
all the fluid's been lost
to space over the years.

71
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:44,228
we'll bag this one,
take it with us.

72
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:48,105
We're deploying
the specimen bag.

73
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,161
Jesus.

74
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,960
What the hell is that?

75
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:11,999
Commander...

76
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,434
the ship has just deployed a--

77
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:18,530
It looks like some sort
of big structure that's just unfolding.

78
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,132
It's enormous.

79
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:24,572
God, what is it?

80
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,053
We must get out of here.

81
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:35,024
Nobody's going anywhere.
Stay where you are.

82
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:39,692
Churchill, this is Carlsen.
What's happening out there?

83
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:41,459
The thing stopped opening.

84
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:45,764
The only way to describe it is
it's like a giant umbrella.

85
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:49,772
Good God.
It's absolutely enormous.

86
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,637
What's it doing now?

87
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:54,177
Nothing, sir.

88
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:59,777
It's stopped opening.

89
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,081
It's just sitting there.

90
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:06,022
- Can you tell what it's made of?
- Not metal.

91
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:07,889
It's radar transparent.

92
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:11,791
Okay.

93
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:14,094
If it starts up again,
let me know.

94
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,566
Any activity out there.
You understand?

95
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,069
Yes, sir.

96
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,214
That's where we're going.

97
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,669
There's something there.

98
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:32,045
Commander, this is Churchill.

99
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:35,085
We're losing our signal.
We've lost V.T.R.

100
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:36,881
Come in, Commander!

101
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:58,242
Three bodies.

102
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,368
Perfectly preserved.

103
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:05,809
They look to me
to be like an--

104
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:08,876
Something's happening to me.

105
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:11,387
What's wrong with me?

106
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:28,573
Commander, come in.

107
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:31,577
This is Churchill.
Do you copy?

108
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:39,243
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sleep.

109
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:40,786
Hold on.
We're coming down.

110
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:06,971
Churchill, if you read...

111
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:10,211
there are two nude males
and one female.

112
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:14,848
This is Churchill.
We have no picture. Come in, Tom.

113
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:19,827
Churchill,
I said we found a young girl.

114
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:22,764
"girl"? You mean human?

115
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:25,232
Definitely humanoid.

116
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:27,235
I'd say she's perfect.

117
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:30,740
I've been in space for six months.
She looks perfect to me.

118
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,608
- Derebridge, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

119
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:57,627
- How many do you want to take back?
- I say we take back all three...

120
00:12:57,702 --> 00:13:00,865
and one of the dead things
in the other chamber.

121
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,740
Let's see if we can break them free.

122
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:27,731
Churchill, come in.
This is Mission Control, Great Britain.

123
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,734
Do you copy?

124
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:32,498
If they're going to pick us up,
they should get us this close.

125
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,801
Simply aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.

126
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:37,901
Automatic circuits don't even respond.

127
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:41,173
They're radio dead.

128
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:45,082
Christ, I hope it's just
their communications.

129
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:58,494
How's their orbit look?

130
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:02,003
You can see it's stable,
but they're slightly off.

131
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,503
They should have adjusted
coming in...

132
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:05,130
but they haven't.

133
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,640
What do you make of that?

134
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,073
It would appear that
they set their course...

135
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:12,580
just after they left the comet
and haven't updated it since.

136
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:22,286
- The Columbia?
- The Columbia.

137
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:25,555
We have a liftoff.

138
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,391
Tower cleared.

139
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:45,211
Control, this is Columbia.

140
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:47,307
Are we cleared
to initiate docking procedure?

141
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:49,909
Go ahead, Columbia.
You are looking good.

142
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:52,455
Stand by for soft dock.

143
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,057
Soft dock.

144
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,595
Soft dock confirmed.

145
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:15,105
Columbia,
the ship's completely gutted.

146
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:16,668
Oh, my God.

147
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:20,977
Houston, we have a problem.
There's been a fire.

148
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:29,720
I'll take a look in the tug bay.
You two, try the top deck.

149
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,347
Columbia, they're all dead.

150
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:02,852
Nothing down here, Columbia.
I'm going into the tug bay.

151
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:07,631
I'll get the tapes.

152
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:40,030
Somner...

153
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,591
there's something you ought to see
in the tug bay.

154
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:02,880
I see.
How did you open the girl's case?

155
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,685
We didn't, Minister.

156
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:08,559
We were talking about how to get it open
when it popped open of its own accord.

157
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,928
- Did you X-ray the crystal cases?
- We're not certain they're crystal.

158
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,459
The casings are not metallic.
I'm not even sure they're organic.

159
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:19,131
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there...

160
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,642
- if that makes any sense.
- And the bodies?

161
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:24,367
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

162
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:29,181
Provided, of course,
that Dr. Fallada agrees they're dead.

163
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:37,050
I don't know that I am quallfied
to pass judgment on alien death.

164
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:39,391
You would agree that
they're less allve than we are?

165
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:45,567
Yesterday in Hong Kong,
gold closed lower.

166
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:48,503
In light trading
on European currency markets...

167
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:51,405
the pound closed mixed against
the dollar and West German marks.

168
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:56,737
There will be a full market report
after the late news.

169
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:00,148
This is James Graham
reporting from the city.

170
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:02,151
Now back to the newsroom.

171
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,326
Hailey's Comet is now
dominating the northern sky...

172
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,864
stretching over 100 million miles
across the heavens...

173
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:17,093
occupying one-sixth
of the entire visible horizon.

174
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,467
On this exceptionally clear night...

175
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:23,201
a group of enthusiasts are commemorating
Dr. Edmund Hailey's great prediction...

176
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:27,211
by holding an outdoor watching from
his original observatory at Greenwich.

177
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,214
Our viewers may be interested
to know...

178
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:32,978
that comets were once considered
to be hargingers of evil.

179
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:35,884
One of the earliest words
for comet was "disaster"...

180
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:38,287
which in Latin means "evil star."

181
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:42,385
It may indeed be an evil star
for the deep space probe Churchill.

182
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:46,091
There's still no word from Her Majesty's
government as to the fate of the crew...

183
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:47,997
whether they're allve or dead.

184
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:49,762
We can only await
further developments--

185
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:12,917
Use my body.

186
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:51,449
- Where's the girl?
- She's gone.

187
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:56,560
I saw her.

188
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:02,965
She did that.

189
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,040
- Security.
- Hello. Professor Fallada here.

190
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:11,203
I'm calling
at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

191
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,148
- Get me the duty security captain now.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:16,648
Don't worry.

193
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:20,085
A naked girl is not going
to get out of this complex.

194
00:24:57,728 --> 00:25:01,629
Four-nine to Control. you'll
never believe what I'm looking at.

195
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:07,834
- Control, can you say that again?
- I believe you heard me.

196
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,068
There's a girl on the loose
in the building. She must not leave.

197
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,803
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

198
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:16,744
That's right. That's what I said.
Surely, you can find her.

199
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,749
Must be some kind of joke.

200
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,056
Don't believe it.

201
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,754
all right, miss,
just stay where you are.

202
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,797
You heard them.
They said grab her.

203
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,924
Take it easy, mate.
She's not in her right mind.

204
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,437
Control, we have located the girl
in the main lobby.

205
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,671
That's it. Come on.

206
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:46,000
- Yes?
- We've located the girl, sir.

207
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,478
- Where?
- She's downstairs in the main lobby.

208
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,344
Right.

209
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:54,750
She's in the main lobby.
You all right to go down there?

210
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:58,254
Nice and easy.

211
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:01,954
Come on.
Come to me.

212
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,996
Come to Daddy.

213
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,633
Make it stop.

214
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:19,270
Come on!
Let's get her!

215
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:07,893
- Are you all right, mate?
- Yeah.

216
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:36,086
all nonmilitary personnel
please clear the area.

217
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:40,495
I repeat: Everybody who has
no business to be here...

218
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:44,501
please clear the area
for your own safety.

219
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:46,332
This is a police announcement.

220
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:53,141
Sorry, gentlemen,
no photographs, please.

221
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:56,443
It's all right.

222
00:27:56,517 --> 00:28:00,750
- Which of you is Dr. Bukovsky?
- I am.

223
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:03,948
- I'm Colonel Caine.
- From the S.A.S.?

224
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:08,017
That last remark is not for publication.
This is a D notice situation.

225
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:23,909
Not too close.

226
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:31,244
And this was murder, you say?

227
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:39,254
Tell me again
how the girl overpowered you.

228
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:42,930
She--

229
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:49,431
It was the most overwhelmingly
feminine presence I've ever encountered.

230
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,934
- I was drawn to her on a level that--
- Was it sexual?

231
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,945
Yes, overwhelmingly so.

232
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:01,972
And horrible.
Loss of control.

233
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:04,043
The guard was dead
when you came into the room?

234
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,487
- You found him as he is now?
- Yeah.

235
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:10,788
And the girl came from the ship
Churchill?

236
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:12,386
Uh-huh.

237
00:29:12,462 --> 00:29:15,954
She spoke to you, in English?

238
00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:17,556
That's right.

239
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:20,399
How would she know English?

240
00:29:20,471 --> 00:29:24,407
Going back, you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire.

241
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:26,408
They weren't destroyed
in the fire.

242
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:29,071
That's what we were told
to tell the public. They were erased.

243
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,579
"Erased"?

244
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:32,912
Also, the Churchill's escape pod
is missing.

245
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:35,612
- Did someone escape?
- We don't know.

246
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:37,746
Unfortunately, the condition
of the bodies...

247
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:40,416
make an accurate count
impossible.

248
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:42,756
Could the heat from the fire
have launched the pod?

249
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:48,766
What started the fire?

250
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:56,273
The ship's oxygen system ignited.
It was a terribly hot fire.

251
00:29:56,342 --> 00:30:01,211
Yet you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

252
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:03,442
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?

253
00:30:03,516 --> 00:30:05,781
In the bay
where the space tug was stored.

254
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:07,944
Where everything else was charred.

255
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:12,287
Incredible, is it not?

256
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:19,860
- Have you examined the cases?
- Using every technique we have.

257
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:22,163
X-ray scans of the cases
yield only blurred images.

258
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:27,140
-What does that mean?
-They're not precisely physical objects.

259
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:29,175
More like a force field.

260
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:33,304
We're a bit out of our depth here.
The whole thing is--

261
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,316
Yes, I know, incredible.

262
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:41,280
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard? I suppose not.

263
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:42,789
What about your two other bodies?

264
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,786
Colonel, may I be excused?

265
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:50,490
I seem to be feeling
a little more nauseous than I thought.

266
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:51,998
Yes, of course.

267
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:03,646
I noticed from your door, Dr. Fallada,
that your area is biochemistry.

268
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,114
But I understand
your real interest is--

269
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,448
Death, Colonel Caine.
Correct.

270
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,452
Thanatology is the name for it.

271
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,955
Death for you
is a bureaucratic problem.

272
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:16,617
Who did it? When?
Why did they do it?

273
00:31:16,693 --> 00:31:19,287
- Am I correct?
- And for you?

274
00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:22,298
I'm fascinated by death itself:

275
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:25,598
what happens as we die, when we die,
what happens after we die.

276
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,969
- You mean life after death?
- Yes.

277
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:33,477
- ls there life after death?
- Do you really want to know?

278
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:41,944
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

279
00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:45,820
If I am correct, the lifeforce
is conserved always...

280
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,859
and in all things,
even after death.

281
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:50,689
You think that applies
to what's happened here tonight?

282
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:54,164
Yes, I do.

283
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:57,669
I think that girl, creature...

284
00:31:57,736 --> 00:32:00,432
drained energy, lifeforce...

285
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:05,101
partially from Bukovsky
and totally from the guard.

286
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:08,875
- A vampire?
- lt could be described that way.

287
00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:10,939
In a sense, we're all vampires.

288
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:14,578
We drain energy
from other life-forms.

289
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:17,783
The difference is one of degree.

290
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:20,726
That girl was no girl.

291
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:24,753
She is totally alien to this planet
and our life-form...

292
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:26,925
and totally dangerous.

293
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:05,806
Jesus.

294
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,446
- Do you believe those blokes are allve?
- I'm not paid to believe nothing.

295
00:33:14,351 --> 00:33:16,285
I believe they're allve.

296
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:21,683
Don't look bloody dead to me.

297
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:18,549
We've had some trouble,
but everything's under control.

298
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:20,711
I think you better
come down here.

299
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:22,778
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.

300
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:42,198
It would appear these two
are no longer dangerous.

301
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:46,713
There is certainly no possiblity
of doing a full autopsy on them.

302
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:48,715
I would like
to examine the guard.

303
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:50,514
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

304
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,019
I believe so, sir.

305
00:34:55,257 --> 00:34:59,717
This is an autopsy on the body of a
young man, dead approximately two hours.

306
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:01,956
- Did you say he was about twenty?
- Yes, that's correct.

307
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,769
Get the Colonel down here!

308
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:09,931
Put him in an isolation cell,
quickly!

309
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:30,309
I had no idea
it could be passed on.

310
00:37:30,388 --> 00:37:32,356
What do you suggest?

311
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:34,823
I would recommend that you
place this body in another cell.

312
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:37,520
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

313
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:40,655
I won't be at all surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

314
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,665
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:44,667
Also, I want the two other male bodies
that were shot.

316
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:46,669
Collect the pieces
and watch them.

317
00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:49,901
- Get me the Home Secretary now.
- Sir.

318
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:52,637
- Call for the Colonel, sir.
- Sir, you have a call.

319
00:37:58,049 --> 00:37:59,607
I'll be right there.

320
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:02,812
They've just found a body in Hyde Park.
A naked girl.

321
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:05,413
They say she's
in an indescribable condition.

322
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,425
Could that be your girl?

323
00:38:08,427 --> 00:38:11,090
- Well?
- That's not her.

324
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,098
Inspector,
what about the two boys?

325
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,136
They were in the park earlier, sir.

326
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:20,640
We saw her, I think, earlier.

327
00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:23,766
Any rate,
that looks like her hair.

328
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,573
- What a mess.
- Was she alone?

329
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:27,671
No, that's why we noticed her.

330
00:38:27,747 --> 00:38:30,774
She was with a dark-haired girl,
real good-looking and all.

331
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,716
Didn't have a lot
of clothes on either.

332
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:34,719
We thought they might be--
Well, you know.

333
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:37,621
Yes. Did you see where
the dark-haired girl went?

334
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,354
No, we didn't.

335
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:42,725
We angled on back
to see if maybe we could...

336
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:45,959
you know,
see them doing something.

337
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,160
- That's when we found her.
- How long ago was that?

338
00:38:48,235 --> 00:38:51,228
- Half an hour ago.
- This lad phoned us, and we called you.

339
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:53,433
Yes. Thank you, lnspector.

340
00:38:56,778 --> 00:38:59,076
Obviously, the work of the girl.

341
00:38:59,148 --> 00:39:01,979
Could we have this body sent back
to the center with the others?

342
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,985
Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.

343
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:06,578
Inspector, let me know
if you find anything else.

344
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:09,249
- we'll be taking her back with us.
- Very good, sir.

345
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,394
Now she has clothes.

346
00:39:16,198 --> 00:39:18,564
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

347
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:32,203
Dr. Hans Fallada, Sir Percy
Hestlestine, the Home Secretary.

348
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:35,274
You're just in time.

349
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:37,344
It's exactly two hours.

350
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,134
This is the guard who was originally
overcome by the space girl.

351
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,768
As I feared,
once transformed...

352
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:34,472
the victims need regular infusions
of energy...

353
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:37,039
- otherwise--
- Otherwise what?

354
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:05,109
Oh, my God. Dear God.

355
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:11,109
And we have the pathologist
who was attacked by the guard.

356
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:23,465
- See?
- He, too, needs feeding.

357
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:43,475
The same thing will happen
to that girl we found in the park...

358
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:44,986
in about one hour.

359
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:10,070
Good Lord! Goodness!

360
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:18,118
She's the last?

361
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:20,849
- Have there been any further reports?
- No, sir.

362
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:23,414
We're set up to get the calls here
the instant one comes in.

363
00:43:23,493 --> 00:43:25,256
- What?
- Nothing.

364
00:43:25,328 --> 00:43:28,957
You say these creatures
were brought back from the Churchill?

365
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,023
Yes, sir, but not this one.
She's a victim of the creatures.

366
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:35,265
Yes, but where did
the Churchill acquire them?

367
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:37,637
We have no way of determining that
at present.

368
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:39,869
- Perhaps that's all changing.
- What?

369
00:43:39,943 --> 00:43:42,706
I've just received a call
from the J.P.L. in Pasadena.

370
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,044
The goldstone tracking disc
has just picked up something...

371
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:49,711
they think is Churchill's escape pod
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

372
00:43:49,787 --> 00:43:52,450
- Where?
- Texas.

373
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:29,850
Where?
Walter Reed Army Hospital?

374
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:33,296
Is he hurt? Just exhausted.

375
00:44:33,365 --> 00:44:35,300
Get him the hell over here!

376
00:44:38,471 --> 00:44:40,440
Colonel Carlsen?
They're expecting you, sir.

377
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:44,376
Colonel Carlsen, sir.

378
00:44:45,612 --> 00:44:47,045
Tom.

379
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:53,585
I thought you were dead.

380
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:59,192
allow me to introduce Colonel Caine
of the Special Air Services.

381
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:00,693
How do you do?

382
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,229
- You already know Dr. Fallada.
- Colonel.

383
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,433
Take a seat.

384
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:12,973
I'm sorry to drag you over here
like this.

385
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,101
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

386
00:45:18,847 --> 00:45:21,372
We've got to know what happened
on the Churchill.

387
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,008
Yes, of course.

388
00:45:26,387 --> 00:45:29,721
It may be very difficult
for you...

389
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,386
to accept what
I'm going to say.

390
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:35,556
we'll have very little difficulty
believing anything you have to tell us.

391
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,932
- Do go on.
- You know something?

392
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:42,028
There was a fire
aboard the Churchill.

393
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:44,836
You might be interested to know that
the bodies of the three humanoids...

394
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,876
were not destroyed in that fire.

395
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:49,411
They survived in their cases.

396
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:52,711
They were brought down here to London,
and the female has escaped.

397
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,717
She's killed three people already.

398
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,676
Oh, my God.

399
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,885
So whatever you have to tell us
is rather pressing.

400
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:04,929
Please, tell us what happened.

401
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:10,292
We found the bodies
aboard the alien spacecraft.

402
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,767
What alien spacecraft?

403
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:17,034
Colonel,
take it from the beginning.

404
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:21,307
Assume we know nothing,
which is understating the matter.

405
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:26,514
We approached within 9,000 miles
of Hailey's Comet...

406
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:32,655
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

407
00:46:32,725 --> 00:46:37,663
After we discovered the bodies,
we transferred them to the Churchill.

408
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,758
We have the three humanoid creatures
and one of the bat-like things.

409
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:44,962
This is Churchill.
We copy. Welcome back.

410
00:46:45,037 --> 00:46:46,973
Have you gotten through
to Earth yet, Rawlings?

411
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:50,339
No, sir, and the tall
of the comet's heating up.

412
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:58,582
- What's the matter, Derebridge?
- I don't know, Tom.

413
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:00,416
I feel drained.

414
00:47:00,488 --> 00:47:01,955
Do you?

415
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,351
I feel invigorated.
You okay?

416
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:11,156
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Okay.

417
00:47:14,403 --> 00:47:16,962
Everybody back
to their stations.

418
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,208
Let's get the hell out of here.

419
00:47:24,812 --> 00:47:28,045
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die...

420
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:30,050
one by one.

421
00:47:35,257 --> 00:47:36,781
Rawlings...

422
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:38,851
the radio officer,
was the first to go.

423
00:47:50,774 --> 00:47:53,369
Rawlings denied any knowledge
of what he had done.

424
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:55,502
I don't remember.

425
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:02,909
Besides myself, you're the only one
who has been up here in the last hour.

426
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:06,950
I've been feeling weak recently...

427
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:09,458
not myself.

428
00:48:09,527 --> 00:48:12,520
Just don't remember.

429
00:48:28,646 --> 00:48:31,446
We found Rawlings' body
the next day.

430
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,893
exactly how...

431
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,260
did he die, Colonel?

432
00:48:44,331 --> 00:48:47,299
The life just drained out of him.

433
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:54,039
One by one...

434
00:48:57,144 --> 00:48:59,169
the rest of the crew
began to die.

435
00:49:02,883 --> 00:49:04,318
Somehow...

436
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,754
I don't know how...

437
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:13,119
I held out.

438
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,692
It just seemed
to be a matter of will.

439
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:23,338
I always thought--

440
00:49:27,742 --> 00:49:29,176
The girl--

441
00:49:30,945 --> 00:49:33,778
Yes? The girl?

442
00:49:39,555 --> 00:49:41,955
I can't remember.

443
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:57,370
What I remember next...

444
00:49:57,441 --> 00:50:00,637
is the view
out of the observation window...

445
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,010
coming into Earth's orbit.

446
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:08,081
I couldn't expose the world
to what we'd brought back with us.

447
00:51:28,804 --> 00:51:31,134
I was determined
to destroy them all.

448
00:51:58,268 --> 00:52:01,032
It was the hardest thing I ever did.

449
00:52:01,104 --> 00:52:03,335
We understand.

450
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:05,341
It must have taken great courage
to try and make--

451
00:52:05,409 --> 00:52:07,344
No, you don't understand.

452
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,743
Part of me didn't want to leave.

453
00:52:11,816 --> 00:52:14,842
She killed all my friends,
and I still didn't want to leave.

454
00:52:16,086 --> 00:52:18,282
Leaving her was the hardest thing
I ever did.

455
00:52:22,593 --> 00:52:25,357
Colonel Carlsen looks exhausted to me.

456
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,763
We should allow him to get some sleep,
continue with this later.

457
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,265
Very well.

458
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:33,937
Thank you, Colonel.

459
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:04,061
NASA tracking and ours...

460
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:07,937
have just reported an unusual structure
leaving Hailey's Comet.

461
00:53:08,007 --> 00:53:09,440
It's headed for us.

462
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:10,977
What is it?

463
00:53:12,113 --> 00:53:13,704
Radar ranging reports the object...

464
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,717
is a needlelike shape,
150 miles long.

465
00:53:17,786 --> 00:53:20,253
Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit...

466
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:23,256
in a little more than two days.

467
00:53:23,324 --> 00:53:26,260
I've just received a call
from the Prime Minister.

468
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:29,757
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

469
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,459
Prime Minister wants answers.

470
00:53:58,162 --> 00:54:00,095
Close your eyes.

471
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:10,206
You're giving me your life.

472
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:21,578
You're taking it.

473
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:29,887
You're draining me.

474
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:32,892
You're taking too much of me.

475
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,783
It was just a dream.

476
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,692
- What dream?
- The girl-- She visited me.

477
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,856
Visited you? How?

478
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:09,365
In my mind.

479
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:17,768
She has some kind
of mental contact with me.

480
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,399
She's draining me.

481
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,411
Tell us about the dream.

482
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:25,242
I can't. It's gone.

483
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:27,148
It's faded.

484
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,651
I can't remember.

485
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,347
Have you ever been hypnotized?

486
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:34,788
Do you mind if I try?

487
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,793
Yeah, let's try it.

488
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:42,993
- Not now. He's too exhausted.
- Fine. ln the morning.

489
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:47,096
Just stare at it until your eyes
feel tired, then close them.

490
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:52,304
You'll feel very tired,
very sleepy.

491
00:56:52,378 --> 00:56:58,214
She seems to speak to me
in my dreams.

492
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:02,053
She--

493
00:57:03,422 --> 00:57:04,890
The girl--

494
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,392
I feeI--

495
00:57:07,426 --> 00:57:10,885
What do you feel for her?

496
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:13,626
I feel very...

497
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,497
close to her.

498
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:18,663
Is she in touch with you?

499
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:21,230
I feel...

500
00:57:21,308 --> 00:57:23,903
as if my mind...

501
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:26,572
is not entirely my own.

502
00:57:26,648 --> 00:57:30,175
If she is in contact
with your mind...

503
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:32,946
perhaps you are in contact
with hers.

504
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:34,545
Can you see her?

505
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:37,284
Can you see where she is?

506
00:57:38,256 --> 00:57:39,689
Yes.

507
00:57:39,758 --> 00:57:41,782
Where is she now?

508
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,296
A place.
I don't know the name of it.

509
00:57:45,363 --> 00:57:46,955
She's walking.

510
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:50,960
She has a different face...

511
00:57:51,036 --> 00:57:52,629
but it's her.

512
00:57:52,705 --> 00:57:54,969
"A different face"?
How can that be?

513
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:57,977
She's using a different body.

514
00:57:58,044 --> 00:58:01,137
- What is she doing?
- She's looking for a man.

515
00:58:01,213 --> 00:58:03,045
What man?

516
00:58:03,114 --> 00:58:06,642
Any man.
A healthy man.

517
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,813
Does she intend to kill him?

518
00:58:09,889 --> 00:58:12,484
- Why not?
- She's afraid of being caught.

519
00:58:12,558 --> 00:58:15,823
- How could she be caught?
- The body would give her away.

520
00:58:15,895 --> 00:58:17,990
What is she hoping to do?

521
00:58:18,066 --> 00:58:20,658
She wants to...

522
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:23,498
draw some energy from him.

523
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,162
Not enough to kill him.

524
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:28,675
- She can do that?
- Yes.

525
00:58:28,742 --> 00:58:31,540
There's another mind.

526
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:33,671
Yes.

527
00:58:33,747 --> 00:58:35,476
The girl's name...

528
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:37,177
is Ellen.

529
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:39,186
There are two people
in one body?

530
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:41,745
Two minds?

531
00:58:41,823 --> 00:58:44,552
Ellen and the vampire?

532
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:46,059
Yes.

533
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:51,291
She's watching a man.

534
00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:53,129
What is the man doing?

535
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:57,798
He's parked,
doing something with his car.

536
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:01,803
Get the license number.

537
00:59:01,877 --> 00:59:05,314
Can you see the license number
of his car?

538
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:06,814
Yes.

539
00:59:08,117 --> 00:59:09,552
Read it out.

540
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,814
FMC...

541
00:59:13,488 --> 00:59:16,425
129E...

542
00:59:16,493 --> 00:59:19,223
or R.

543
00:59:19,296 --> 00:59:22,163
What is the make of the car?

544
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:26,501
A white Volvo.

545
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:32,038
What is she doing now?

546
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:34,970
They're driving now.

547
00:59:35,046 --> 00:59:37,946
Does she ask him his name?

548
00:59:38,014 --> 00:59:42,953
She's pulling her skirt...

549
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:46,117
over her knees.

550
00:59:47,191 --> 00:59:48,626
She's--

551
00:59:49,694 --> 00:59:51,127
He's...

552
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:54,465
putting his...

553
00:59:57,035 --> 01:00:01,301
hand on her leg.

554
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:19,990
FMC129E or possibly R...

555
01:00:20,059 --> 01:00:22,152
belonging to a white Volvo.

556
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:24,992
The driver of the car
picked up a girl named Ellen.

557
01:00:25,064 --> 01:00:28,000
I have to know who the girl is
and where we can find her.

558
01:00:28,068 --> 01:00:30,160
She's connected with the case.

559
01:00:30,236 --> 01:00:33,331
I can't explain over an open line.
Thank you.

560
01:00:34,908 --> 01:00:37,173
Do you think he's telling the truth
about the girl?

561
01:00:37,245 --> 01:00:39,178
we'll soon see.

562
01:00:39,246 --> 01:00:43,615
How brilliant, if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind...

563
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:47,281
taking only a small amount
of energy from each victim.

564
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:50,290
It would make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

565
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:52,326
She's hoping to leave no trail.

566
01:00:52,394 --> 01:00:56,798
If the girl is no longer in her
original body, where is her body?

567
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:00,962
- Hidden.
- Let's find it.

568
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:04,467
Supposing you're right
about all of this.

569
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,032
What about that ship up there?
What's it doing?

570
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:12,342
We can't know that,
but we've got to assume the worst.

571
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:14,475
Maybe they're like
the vampires of legend.

572
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:16,484
How's that?

573
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:20,319
They would carry their Earth
with them, in their coffins.

574
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:22,380
Wouldn't they?

575
01:01:24,728 --> 01:01:27,822
- We have the feed from Hawall.
- Here it comes.

576
01:01:27,898 --> 01:01:33,734
- Put it on screen number one.
- Coming in 240,000 miles.

577
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:38,467
My God, it's immense.

578
01:01:57,863 --> 01:02:01,958
Hugh, do you have that skin tissue
sample I asked for?

579
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:03,797
Good.

580
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:06,804
Of course, I'll follow
containment procedure.

581
01:02:06,872 --> 01:02:08,305
He's here now.

582
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:10,807
Send in that soldier, please.

583
01:02:14,214 --> 01:02:15,647
Thank you.

584
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:53,947
One moment, Sergeant.
Thank you for coming.

585
01:02:54,022 --> 01:02:56,286
I'll be with you shortly.

586
01:03:06,368 --> 01:03:08,802
bloody awful job, chasing that car.

587
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,965
It belongs to a man named
Ned Price who lives in Yorkshire.

588
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:14,976
- We have him under detention now.
- What about the girl?

589
01:03:15,043 --> 01:03:18,480
The girl he picked up
was a nurse named Ellen, as you said.

590
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:21,141
Ellen something.
He doesn't know her other name.

591
01:03:21,217 --> 01:03:25,314
He dropped her at Thurlstone Hospital
after spending the afternoon with her.

592
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:29,826
He was reluctant to talk about it.
The man's totally exhausted.

593
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:33,157
Isn't Thurlstone an asylum
of some sort?

594
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:36,290
Yes, for the criminally insane.

595
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:03,127
How do you do? I'm Dr. Armstrong,
director of the hospital.

596
01:04:03,195 --> 01:04:05,128
Come with me to my office.

597
01:04:09,702 --> 01:04:12,466
- It's a cold night.
- Bitterly cold.

598
01:04:13,539 --> 01:04:16,304
This is the nurses' house.

599
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:19,139
Ellen Donaldson is number five.

600
01:04:19,212 --> 01:04:20,803
Thank you.

601
01:04:20,879 --> 01:04:23,313
Shouldn't I come up
and introduce you?

602
01:04:23,383 --> 01:04:25,316
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Come along, Dr. Armstrong.

603
01:04:25,384 --> 01:04:27,819
You and I have several matters
to discuss.

604
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:34,822
Yes? Who is it?

605
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:37,920
My name's Colin Caine.
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

606
01:04:37,998 --> 01:04:40,934
I'd like to talk to you.
May I come in?

607
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:51,778
Yes?

608
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,116
- What do you want?
- My name is Colin Caine.

609
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:59,118
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.

610
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:03,623
May we come in and talk to you?
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

611
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,636
May I sit down?

612
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:21,541
I want to ask about the man you spent
the afternoon with, Ned Price.

613
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:27,046
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I think you do.

614
01:05:27,116 --> 01:05:30,210
- Let me see your hand.
- Beg your pardon?

615
01:05:34,692 --> 01:05:36,682
You're in there, aren't you?

616
01:05:38,962 --> 01:05:41,522
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

617
01:05:47,837 --> 01:05:49,772
It's gone from her.
It's in another body now.

618
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:53,607
- How do you know that?
- I can see it, in her mind.

619
01:05:55,313 --> 01:05:59,113
She's resisting.
I'll have to force her to tell me.

620
01:05:59,184 --> 01:06:03,120
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

621
01:06:03,188 --> 01:06:04,655
An extreme masochist.

622
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:07,124
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

623
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:09,957
She wants me to hurt her.

624
01:06:10,029 --> 01:06:14,693
I can see the images in her mind.
Do you want to stay?

625
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:18,864
- Otherwise, wait outside!
- Not at all. I am a natural voyeur.

626
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:25,677
Are you in there?

627
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:36,045
Are you there?

628
01:06:40,962 --> 01:06:42,394
Let go.

629
01:06:43,662 --> 01:06:45,187
Now.

630
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,320
Well?

631
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:41,482
I've got a physical description.

632
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,166
You better send someone
to look after Nurse Donaldson.

633
01:07:51,236 --> 01:07:52,668
Is she all right?

634
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,226
If I described one of the inmates
to you, could you identify him?

635
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:56,773
Possibly.

636
01:07:56,841 --> 01:08:01,073
Big man, fat, gray hair,
birthmark on his face.

637
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:05,139
Jeffrey Sykes, the child murderer.
Where did you get his description?

638
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:09,677
- Where is he now?
- He's in solitary confinement.

639
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:11,381
He's been naughty.

640
01:08:11,456 --> 01:08:14,357
- What is this about?
- What we're looking for has moved.

641
01:08:14,426 --> 01:08:17,521
- We could be here some time.
- I better call London.

642
01:08:17,596 --> 01:08:20,361
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.

643
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:23,870
- We have to see Sykes now.
- Couldn't this wait until the morning?

644
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:27,364
all right, I'll arrange it.

645
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,705
Anything to oblige, Commander.

646
01:08:36,284 --> 01:08:38,308
I wish this were not so mysterious.

647
01:08:38,385 --> 01:08:41,821
If the police are involved,
haven't I a right to know?

648
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:44,983
If you're going to start
messing about with my patients--

649
01:08:47,528 --> 01:08:50,325
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

650
01:08:50,397 --> 01:08:54,492
However, I can tell you
it is a matter of national security.

651
01:08:54,568 --> 01:08:56,002
I see.

652
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:59,163
But don't you think
that I should be present...

653
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:01,333
to represent the interests
of my patient?

654
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:03,171
- You see--
- Can I talk to you for a second?

655
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:04,676
Of course.

656
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,510
The man has the I.Q.
of a child of four.

657
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:12,178
That's a decision I shall have
to defer to Colonel Caine.

658
01:09:12,253 --> 01:09:15,519
Yes, of course, you can come along.
Can we start now?

659
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:19,584
- What are you going to do to him?
- I'd like to hypnotize him.

660
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:25,024
What's that?

661
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,034
Pentothal and morphine.

662
01:09:27,101 --> 01:09:30,868
Recommended for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

663
01:09:41,885 --> 01:09:45,651
Well, he seems quiet.

664
01:09:45,722 --> 01:09:47,987
- We're ready when you are.
- Lamson.

665
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,491
Sir.

666
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,843
Can the injection be dangerous?

667
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,115
He should have no difficulty
tolerating it.

668
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:19,248
There's always a risk, sir.

669
01:10:19,324 --> 01:10:21,292
May I have that?

670
01:10:23,161 --> 01:10:25,025
I'll wake him up.

671
01:10:27,834 --> 01:10:29,698
- What are you doing?
- Stay where you are.

672
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:33,034
He's sick, Lamson.
Help us. I can't explain now.

673
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:37,809
There's our killer, Sir Percy.

674
01:11:07,409 --> 01:11:09,742
It's madness.

675
01:11:10,945 --> 01:11:13,311
I want to question him.
Where can we take him?

676
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:14,849
Up the ramp, sir.

677
01:11:34,104 --> 01:11:36,196
We need to be alone.

678
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:46,872
How did you know it was him?

679
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:51,319
In the nurses' quarters,
he touched me on the shoulder.

680
01:11:51,388 --> 01:11:53,084
I saw into his mind.

681
01:11:54,224 --> 01:11:55,656
What?

682
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:59,162
The Colonel is able to see
into the minds of people...

683
01:11:59,229 --> 01:12:03,064
who have been possessed
by the girl creature, sir.

684
01:12:03,134 --> 01:12:08,266
It happens when I touch them.
Let's get him on the table.

685
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,515
How--

686
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,016
How do you know
she's still inside Armstrong?

687
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:24,146
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone else?

688
01:12:24,224 --> 01:12:25,849
She's trapped.

689
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,888
I can feel that.

690
01:12:28,961 --> 01:12:30,519
Are you sure?

691
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,662
- Lamson.
- Sir?

692
01:12:39,738 --> 01:12:44,938
- Bring me another dose of the drug.
- One dose is usually enough.

693
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:48,572
This is not a usual situation.
How long does this stuff last?

694
01:12:48,648 --> 01:12:51,675
A dose like that?
A couple of hours.

695
01:12:51,752 --> 01:12:54,810
we'll definitely need more.

696
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:57,551
- Bring me three doses.
- Three?

697
01:12:57,625 --> 01:13:01,584
I'll take responsibility.
Just get on with it.

698
01:13:01,662 --> 01:13:03,493
Yes, sir.

699
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,992
Is a second dose safe?

700
01:13:07,067 --> 01:13:09,160
Surely it can strain his heart.

701
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:14,332
Look, you don't know
what we're deallng with here.

702
01:13:14,407 --> 01:13:18,845
If he slips out from under,
she'll escape.

703
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,364
Can you hear me?

704
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:42,137
If you can hear me,
just say yes.

705
01:13:47,343 --> 01:13:50,643
It won't let me...

706
01:13:52,881 --> 01:13:54,316
talk to you.

707
01:14:16,407 --> 01:14:18,672
Can you see
what's holding you prisoner?

708
01:14:22,248 --> 01:14:25,183
Yes. She--

709
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:28,345
Tell her she has to talk to me!

710
01:14:29,421 --> 01:14:30,853
Yes?

711
01:14:33,259 --> 01:14:35,522
I brought the Pentothal.

712
01:14:35,593 --> 01:14:37,460
Thanks. That will be all.

713
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:46,304
Hold him.

714
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,370
There's no need for that.

715
01:15:14,368 --> 01:15:18,304
You in there?
Can you still hear me?

716
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:23,609
Can you get into his mind,
her mind?

717
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,408
Not with this drug.
It's like a wall.

718
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,176
Perhaps you've given him too much.

719
01:15:28,249 --> 01:15:29,717
Shut up!

720
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:37,353
Listen, you bitch...

721
01:15:37,426 --> 01:15:40,396
I'll keep you in this state
for weeks if I have to.

722
01:15:40,463 --> 01:15:42,089
Now, you talk to me.

723
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:44,099
Carlsen, be with me.

724
01:15:45,368 --> 01:15:48,565
- What do you want from me?
- I love you.

725
01:15:52,508 --> 01:15:54,305
What are you?

726
01:15:54,378 --> 01:15:57,973
Why are you so human, so perfect?

727
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:01,051
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

728
01:16:01,118 --> 01:16:03,985
Our bodies are unimportant.

729
01:16:04,054 --> 01:16:08,013
As you and your men approached
in your ship...

730
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:10,492
we changed them for you.

731
01:16:10,561 --> 01:16:13,223
We entered your minds...

732
01:16:13,297 --> 01:16:15,993
and found there new bodies.

733
01:16:16,066 --> 01:16:18,627
I took my shape from your mind.

734
01:16:19,703 --> 01:16:22,695
I took your language.

735
01:16:22,773 --> 01:16:25,504
I became the woman I found there...

736
01:16:25,577 --> 01:16:29,980
in your deepest thoughts,
your deepest needs.

737
01:16:31,249 --> 01:16:34,582
I am the feminine in your mind.

738
01:16:40,526 --> 01:16:43,120
Where are you?

739
01:16:43,195 --> 01:16:44,628
Where's your body?

740
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:47,958
Let me go!

741
01:16:55,008 --> 01:16:56,771
Touch me, Carlsen.

742
01:18:33,979 --> 01:18:35,913
- It's already spreading.
- How?

743
01:18:35,981 --> 01:18:38,006
- You didn't stop it. It's too late.
- That's impossible.

744
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:40,016
We've only been half a step
behind her all the way.

745
01:18:40,084 --> 01:18:42,021
This gentleman stopped breathing.

746
01:18:43,456 --> 01:18:45,389
There's no pulse either.

747
01:18:55,769 --> 01:18:57,202
I think his neck is broken.

748
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:04,710
Prepare a stretcher for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

749
01:19:04,777 --> 01:19:07,042
Prepare all your remaining doses
of the drug for travel.

750
01:19:07,114 --> 01:19:08,547
Yes, sir.

751
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:19,224
You said the thing hadn't stopped,
it was still spreading.

752
01:19:19,293 --> 01:19:22,559
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

753
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:26,066
Could the girl have been deliberately
leading us away from London?

754
01:19:26,134 --> 01:19:28,295
Did we find all of her victims?

755
01:19:29,572 --> 01:19:32,540
If there are others
besides the girl in the park--

756
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,509
- The thing would spread.
- ln a chain reaction...

757
01:19:35,578 --> 01:19:37,842
geometrically,
until, by now--

758
01:19:39,548 --> 01:19:40,981
Christ.

759
01:20:14,452 --> 01:20:18,218
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to reach the S.R.C. in London?

760
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:21,725
Just a moment, sir.
There's something coming through.

761
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:24,158
It is the S.R.C.
for you and Carlsen.

762
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:28,898
Go ahead.

763
01:20:28,966 --> 01:20:31,902
Can you hear me?

764
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:35,063
Fallada, speak up!
I can't hear you!

765
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:39,167
The two males didn't die.

766
01:20:39,245 --> 01:20:41,838
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soldiers who shot them...

767
01:20:41,913 --> 01:20:45,349
and transformed the soldiers' bodies
into their own likenesses.

768
01:20:45,417 --> 01:20:47,352
That's the difference
between them and their victims.

769
01:20:47,419 --> 01:20:51,789
Their victims can't leave their bodies.
Only the original three can do that.

770
01:20:51,858 --> 01:20:55,020
- But I've killed one of them.
- One of which?

771
01:20:55,093 --> 01:20:57,358
One of the two male vampires.

772
01:20:57,430 --> 01:21:01,992
- One of the transformed ones.
- How did you kill him?

773
01:21:02,068 --> 01:21:04,195
The old way, Carlsen.

774
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:08,366
A leaded metal shaft
penetrating not through the heart...

775
01:21:08,441 --> 01:21:12,538
but through the energy center
two inches below the heart.

776
01:21:12,613 --> 01:21:15,707
Not steel, but leaded iron.

777
01:21:15,782 --> 01:21:17,546
Right, Carlsen?

778
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:22,222
- Are you there?
- Yes.

779
01:21:22,288 --> 01:21:25,350
Carlsen, and you, too, Caine...

780
01:21:25,428 --> 01:21:27,360
it is my belief...

781
01:21:27,428 --> 01:21:32,059
that the vampires of legend
came from creatures such as these.

782
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:35,363
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

783
01:21:35,436 --> 01:21:37,998
I know it sounds incredible.

784
01:21:39,909 --> 01:21:41,536
Do you hear me?

785
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:45,979
It's more than a belief.
It's true.

786
01:21:47,215 --> 01:21:48,877
They visited Earth before.

787
01:21:50,921 --> 01:21:54,253
- What about the other male?
- He's free.

788
01:21:55,591 --> 01:21:57,855
- You have the girl?
- Yes.

789
01:21:57,927 --> 01:22:01,590
- we'll be there soon. Hold on.
- we'll try.

790
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:07,166
- This came while you were talking.
- What is it?

791
01:22:07,236 --> 01:22:11,038
A scrambled cryptograph to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

792
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:14,044
We're to proceed directly
to the citadel at Whitehall.

793
01:22:55,754 --> 01:22:57,382
Lieutenant, the controls!

794
01:23:11,504 --> 01:23:13,495
We've lost her.
She's gone!

795
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:17,533
- Where?
- Her body's in London.

796
01:23:17,611 --> 01:23:19,543
Where in London?

797
01:23:22,283 --> 01:23:25,651
You've got to tell me
what really happened on the Churchill.

798
01:23:28,122 --> 01:23:31,216
It wasn't Rawlings
who destroyed the radio equipment...

799
01:23:31,292 --> 01:23:33,055
and the ship's tapes.

800
01:23:34,128 --> 01:23:36,359
- lt was me.
- Why?

801
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:39,992
I didn't want the Churchill
to be able to reach Earth.

802
01:23:40,068 --> 01:23:42,661
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

803
01:23:42,736 --> 01:23:44,170
What did happen?

804
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:49,337
I opened her sealed
animation case.

805
01:23:49,412 --> 01:23:54,179
Either I did it
or she did it.

806
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:56,684
I couldn't help myself.

807
01:23:56,752 --> 01:23:58,845
I've never experienced such--

808
01:24:00,756 --> 01:24:04,021
I was in love on a level
you've never known.

809
01:24:09,766 --> 01:24:12,529
It terrifies me.

810
01:24:12,602 --> 01:24:15,196
My memory plays tricks on me.

811
01:24:18,609 --> 01:24:20,543
She was calling me.

812
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:25,377
Her power was spiritual.

813
01:24:56,249 --> 01:24:58,182
She wanted me, Caine.

814
01:25:02,756 --> 01:25:04,415
It was more than spiritual.

815
01:25:17,938 --> 01:25:20,338
She took some of my energy.

816
01:25:22,977 --> 01:25:25,707
And she gave me
some of her energy.

817
01:25:33,286 --> 01:25:37,223
They must have been living
off of each other when we found them.

818
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:39,885
There were only three of them left.

819
01:25:41,562 --> 01:25:45,967
She killed all of my men,
one by one.

820
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:49,636
But I survived.

821
01:25:50,739 --> 01:25:54,470
She wanted me to survive.
She chose me!

822
01:25:56,078 --> 01:25:57,511
Why?

823
01:25:58,681 --> 01:26:01,843
She's not human.
She's not a woman.

824
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:03,852
She'll destroy you.

825
01:26:05,755 --> 01:26:08,349
She's destroyed worlds.

826
01:26:08,424 --> 01:26:10,358
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

827
01:26:10,426 --> 01:26:12,987
A special bulletin
from the BBC.

828
01:26:14,263 --> 01:26:16,197
Tonight London is on the brink...

829
01:26:16,265 --> 01:26:18,359
of the worst devastation
since the blitz.

830
01:26:18,435 --> 01:26:23,702
I can see large areas of the city
burning out of control.

831
01:26:23,774 --> 01:26:26,368
Thousands of people are now rampaging
through the streets...

832
01:26:26,443 --> 01:26:30,380
in a frenzied last effort
to avoid the plague.

833
01:26:30,447 --> 01:26:33,042
Martial law has been enforced now
for three hours...

834
01:26:33,118 --> 01:26:35,677
but it hasn't stemmed
what is obviously--

835
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:32,176
- Yes, we've been expecting you.
- Thank you. Carry on.

836
01:27:32,245 --> 01:27:34,839
- Hurry over, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.

837
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,213
- Go around the other side.
- Right.

838
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:48,052
Is everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?

839
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:51,224
- Yes, everything.
- Please take a seat, gentlemen.

840
01:27:55,204 --> 01:28:00,574
Sir, I have Colonel Caine
and Colonel Carlsen here for you.

841
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:02,270
Very good.

842
01:28:02,344 --> 01:28:06,211
The Prime Minister will see you shortly.
Would you care for tea while you wait?

843
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:10,548
- Our business is rather urgent.
- The Prime Minister understands that.

844
01:28:11,654 --> 01:28:13,087
- Gentlemen.
- Prime Minister.

845
01:28:13,156 --> 01:28:14,748
I'm Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service...

846
01:28:14,824 --> 01:28:17,587
and I'm sure you've heard
of Colonel Carlsen of the Churchill.

847
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,093
Yes, indeed.

848
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:21,825
Gentlemen, I look forward
to hearing your report.

849
01:28:21,898 --> 01:28:23,890
By the way,
where is Sir Percy?

850
01:28:23,968 --> 01:28:25,491
Dead, I'm afraid.

851
01:28:25,568 --> 01:28:27,434
Oh, that's a great pity.

852
01:28:27,505 --> 01:28:31,736
Sir, we have information
regarding the object in space...

853
01:28:31,809 --> 01:28:34,437
- which is bearing down on the Earth--
- Yes, gentlemen.

854
01:28:34,512 --> 01:28:37,276
If you'll excuse me
just for a moment.

855
01:28:37,348 --> 01:28:39,873
Miss Haversham,
please come this way.

856
01:28:41,452 --> 01:28:43,045
Here, for a moment.

857
01:28:43,121 --> 01:28:45,054
I'll be back, gentlemen.

858
01:29:01,207 --> 01:29:02,640
Please.

859
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:14,085
Somebody get the doctor immediately.

860
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:20,789
We need a doctor over here.

861
01:29:34,943 --> 01:29:36,637
Go!

862
01:30:03,938 --> 01:30:07,170
- Do you have any weapons aboard?
- No, sir!

863
01:30:07,243 --> 01:30:09,542
- There is a flare pistol, sir.
- Where is it?

864
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,773
Close the breach
and it's ready to fire!

865
01:30:11,848 --> 01:30:13,439
Get him!

866
01:30:19,322 --> 01:30:22,916
While you were with the Prime Minister,
I had a call from base operations.

867
01:30:22,992 --> 01:30:26,258
The city is now under martial law.
We've been placed under NATO command.

868
01:30:26,329 --> 01:30:27,763
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.

869
01:30:27,831 --> 01:30:31,096
My unit's been mobilized
to a staging area at Blackheath.

870
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:33,966
Land at the S.R.C.
We've got to talk to Fallada.

871
01:30:34,038 --> 01:30:37,873
I'm to land at Blackheath.
The city's under air quarantine.

872
01:30:37,942 --> 01:30:39,967
If we don't do as they say,
they'll shoot us down.

873
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:49,381
Zero, this is X-ray 318 requesting
clearance to land. Over.

874
01:30:49,453 --> 01:30:52,547
Zero, roger.
X-ray 318, you are clear to land.

875
01:31:02,334 --> 01:31:05,896
Come away from the aircraft!
You are under quarantine!

876
01:31:07,806 --> 01:31:09,000
Over here, please, sir.

877
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,905
Don't come any closer!
Stop there!

878
01:31:12,979 --> 01:31:15,138
I want to talk
to your commanding officer.

879
01:31:15,213 --> 01:31:17,239
I am Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service...

880
01:31:17,317 --> 01:31:21,947
and this man is Colonel Tom Carlsen,
United States Air Force...

881
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:23,716
and former commander
of the Churchill.

882
01:31:27,994 --> 01:31:30,930
Is Dr. Hans Fallada here
from the S.R.C.?

883
01:31:30,998 --> 01:31:34,764
- He knows who we are.
- No, not that I know of.

884
01:31:34,835 --> 01:31:36,996
Has anybody heard of him?

885
01:31:37,071 --> 01:31:39,039
He must still be in London.

886
01:31:39,106 --> 01:31:41,301
Colonel, what exactly do you know
about what's happening there?

887
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:46,870
all we know for certain is that
a terrible plague is sweeping London.

888
01:31:46,947 --> 01:31:49,781
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

889
01:31:49,851 --> 01:31:54,345
Until that time has elapsed,
I cannot release you from this compound.

890
01:31:54,422 --> 01:31:57,652
We know what the plague is.
We are not infected.

891
01:31:57,725 --> 01:32:01,059
I know what I'm talking about!
We're wasting valuable time!

892
01:32:02,364 --> 01:32:04,059
We have totally isolated London...

893
01:32:04,132 --> 01:32:06,727
in order to stop further contagion.

894
01:32:06,802 --> 01:32:10,238
If that falls, and the surrounding
areas are threatened...

895
01:32:10,307 --> 01:32:12,500
Yes?

896
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:16,102
sterilization by thermonuclear device
has been approved.

897
01:32:17,813 --> 01:32:20,680
We have this from General Ames
in Brussels.

898
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:25,881
He's coming up with that decision
in just under three hours.

899
01:32:25,955 --> 01:32:28,584
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

900
01:32:28,659 --> 01:32:31,559
- "The ship"?
- The thing from Hailey's Comet.

901
01:32:34,497 --> 01:32:38,127
It's parked itself in a geostationary
orbit directly over London.

902
01:32:57,156 --> 01:33:03,061
all those little blue lights going up
toward the clouds are human souls.

903
01:33:04,295 --> 01:33:07,424
- How do you know that?
- I feel it.

904
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:12,198
The process of conversion releases
a life energy that can be collected.

905
01:33:12,271 --> 01:33:13,738
"Collected"?

906
01:33:14,974 --> 01:33:18,966
Is that what the umbrella is?
A collector?

907
01:33:19,044 --> 01:33:22,879
The energy doesn't go free.
It goes up there.

908
01:33:44,104 --> 01:33:47,165
The male vampire is collecting
life energy...

909
01:33:47,241 --> 01:33:51,701
but he has to send it through her
to get it up to the collector.

910
01:33:53,447 --> 01:33:55,382
Where is she?

911
01:33:57,051 --> 01:33:58,483
Over there.

912
01:33:59,955 --> 01:34:02,719
I get flashes
coming from her body.

913
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:07,058
It's sensitive to its environment.
It picks up things.

914
01:34:07,129 --> 01:34:10,566
- Can you find her?
- lf I can get across to the city.

915
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,234
What about the male?

916
01:34:13,302 --> 01:34:16,065
He'll come if he senses I found her.

917
01:34:16,138 --> 01:34:19,233
She's drawing me.

918
01:34:19,308 --> 01:34:21,070
I've got to go.

919
01:34:22,577 --> 01:34:24,067
Why?

920
01:34:24,147 --> 01:34:27,083
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

921
01:34:30,154 --> 01:34:33,180
When they take on a new life-form...

922
01:34:33,257 --> 01:34:36,419
they have to learn
from that life-form.

923
01:34:36,492 --> 01:34:38,358
Mate with it, in a sense.

924
01:34:40,764 --> 01:34:42,698
The girl chose me.

925
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:48,197
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herself.

926
01:34:50,941 --> 01:34:53,035
Now she wants that part back.

927
01:34:54,345 --> 01:34:57,211
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector? Over.

928
01:34:57,282 --> 01:35:00,877
- No, sir.
- Okay, keep me posted. Over.

929
01:35:00,952 --> 01:35:04,388
Colonel, listen to me. Carlsen
believes he can locate the source.

930
01:35:04,455 --> 01:35:06,220
There are only two carriers.

931
01:35:06,292 --> 01:35:09,886
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

932
01:35:09,961 --> 01:35:12,556
But we only have
an hour and a half.

933
01:35:13,798 --> 01:35:15,390
Cease firing!

934
01:35:16,802 --> 01:35:19,896
Where's Carlsen?

935
01:35:19,972 --> 01:35:22,237
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored land rover.

936
01:35:22,309 --> 01:35:24,242
Did he say where he was going?

937
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:27,405
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was.

938
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:29,413
Rogers told him,
then I was on the ground.

939
01:35:29,481 --> 01:35:31,575
- Right. Whose car is this?
- That?

940
01:35:31,652 --> 01:35:33,676
- That's the Colonel's.
- Give me the keys.

941
01:35:33,753 --> 01:35:37,484
- What?
- I'm commandeering the car!

942
01:35:37,558 --> 01:35:38,990
Give it to him.

943
01:35:40,493 --> 01:35:41,791
And your side arm.

944
01:35:45,433 --> 01:35:47,866
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

945
01:35:49,135 --> 01:35:51,661
Once you're inside there,
we can't allow you out.

946
01:35:55,476 --> 01:35:57,171
- Watch out!
- He's going in!

947
01:36:01,782 --> 01:36:03,876
Colonel Caine, S.A.S.
I'm crossing the river.

948
01:36:03,952 --> 01:36:06,386
- You don't want to go in there.
- I know I don't.

949
01:36:08,457 --> 01:36:11,893
Get them gates in position!
Secure this post! Move!

950
01:40:13,014 --> 01:40:14,948
I'm glad to see you allve.

951
01:40:16,017 --> 01:40:18,748
I reciprocate the sentiment.

952
01:40:18,822 --> 01:40:22,654
- ls he really dead this time?
- The only way they can be killed.

953
01:40:32,001 --> 01:40:34,629
- Where's Bukovsky?
- Dead.

954
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:39,239
- How?
- Like the rest.

955
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,574
How did you survive?

956
01:40:47,484 --> 01:40:51,749
- You're looking for Carlsen.
- Has he been here?

957
01:40:51,821 --> 01:40:54,416
No. Perhaps he misled you.

958
01:40:54,492 --> 01:40:57,791
- What do you know about it?
- I've been doing some more work.

959
01:40:57,863 --> 01:41:01,922
- Go on.
- I've discovered...

960
01:41:01,999 --> 01:41:05,196
there is life after death.

961
01:41:05,269 --> 01:41:10,435
-How do you know?
-There is a certain mental transference.

962
01:41:10,508 --> 01:41:14,672
Telepathy occurs between
the vampires and their victims.

963
01:41:17,349 --> 01:41:21,649
- Carlsen is after the girl.
- How did you know that?

964
01:41:24,856 --> 01:41:28,292
- I seem to sense it.
- Where is she?

965
01:41:31,197 --> 01:41:33,130
Don't you know?

966
01:41:36,035 --> 01:41:38,969
- Carlsen knows.
- Where?

967
01:41:39,037 --> 01:41:42,735
She's in the cathedral.

968
01:41:42,809 --> 01:41:45,744
She's been there
since she escaped.

969
01:41:45,812 --> 01:41:48,747
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

970
01:41:48,816 --> 01:41:51,909
The crypt of kings and queens.

971
01:41:51,985 --> 01:41:53,577
Stay where you are.

972
01:42:13,675 --> 01:42:15,267
Here I go.

973
01:43:32,825 --> 01:43:34,816
I knew you would come.

974
01:44:19,141 --> 01:44:20,574
I'm here.

975
01:44:20,642 --> 01:44:23,702
Now can this madness end?

976
01:44:24,679 --> 01:44:26,613
Come.

977
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,376
Be with me.

978
01:44:29,684 --> 01:44:31,584
I need you.

979
01:44:31,654 --> 01:44:34,122
It was always intended...

980
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:35,851
you should find us...

981
01:44:35,925 --> 01:44:38,485
and bring us to Earth.

982
01:44:45,335 --> 01:44:49,566
The web of destiny
carries your blood and soul...

983
01:44:49,639 --> 01:44:53,167
back to the genesis
of my life-form.

984
01:44:59,483 --> 01:45:01,109
Come with me.

985
01:48:13,087 --> 01:48:16,817
It will be much less terrifying
if you just come to me.

986
01:48:22,296 --> 01:48:23,924
I'll do just that.

987
01:49:51,691 --> 01:49:53,123
What are these feelings?

988
01:49:53,192 --> 01:49:57,128
Why do I feel so close to you,
need you?

989
01:49:57,196 --> 01:50:01,657
Because you're one of us.
You always have been.

990
01:50:01,734 --> 01:50:03,702
You're like me.
Be with me.

991
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:19,486
Just a little more.

992
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:06,200
