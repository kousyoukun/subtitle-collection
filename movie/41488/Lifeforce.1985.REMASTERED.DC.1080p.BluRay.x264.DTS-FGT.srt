片名：《宇宙天魔》

2
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,146
格林威治时间8月9日，下午2:30
<i>August 9th, 2:30 PM,
Greenwich Mean Time.</i>

3
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,523
H.M.S. 邱吉尔号的外太空
<i>The HMS Churchill outward bound.</i>

4
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:50,276
在英美空间站的一个节点上
<i>On board a joint British/American
space team.</i>

5
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,445
这次任务是研究哈雷慧星的运行轨道
<i>Their mission:
to intercept and study</i>
<i>the comet bearing
Dr. Edmond Halley's name.</i>

6
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:58,701
邱吉尔号是第一艘装备“那维”引擎的太空船
<i>The Churchill is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.</i>

7
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,662
邱吉尔号由推进器加速
<i>It propels the Churchill
with constant acceleration,</i>

8
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:04,457
在飞行器上第一次产生了
足够的类似地球的引力
<i>enough to create Earth-type gravity
for the first time</i>
<i>on an extended flight.</i>

9
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,837
这次考察是邱吉尔号的一次学习机会
<i>The Churchill is on course
for its rendezvous.</i>

10
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:11,756
- 长官，这是奇数
- 什么？
Sir, this is odd.

11
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,798
我得到一个跨越区段的雷达信号
What?
I'm getting a very small
radar cross section,

12
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,511
在沉睡的慧星核心之前
just ahead of the nucleus
in the coma of the comet.

13
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,013
我也得到了它，检查波长，
它在扫描仪边界按某一角度转动
I've got it too.
Check the length, Brendan,
it's at the limit of my angle of scan.

14
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,976
- 什么？在转动？
- 启动另一个设备检查
- What's going on?
- Did you chaps run an equipment check?

15
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,686
每五分钟转一次
<i>I've been checking
every five minutes, sir.</i>

16
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:27,730
- 速度150英里
- 150英里什么？
Radar state's 150 miles.

17
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,857
- 长度
- 150英里长？
- 150 miles what?
- Length.
Hundred and fifty miles long?

18
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,695
什么有150英里长？
What's 150 miles long?

19
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:37,114
是雷达追踪到的
It's a radar trace.

20
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,991
- 有东西在沉睡的慧星前
- 给我看看
Something right ahead
in the coma of the comet.

21
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,034
- E.G.R. 被确认
- 看起来很好
Show me.
<i>EGR's confirmed.</i>

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,537
E.G.R. 是最佳的
<i>Looks good.</i>

23
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:46,226
继续跟踪
<i>EGR's optimal,
track three on three.</i>

24
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,958
罗杰
<i>Roget.</i>

25
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,921
它的高度是多少？
What's the height of the thing?

26
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,799
高度至少有2里
I've got a vertical reading
of two miles, at least.

27
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,634
周围温度：6华氏度
<i>Ambient temperature six degrees.</i>

28
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,512
锰，钛含量少于百分之二
<i>Iron less than 2%,
traces of manganese, titanium--</i>

29
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,846
把基数调高试试
Try and raise base.

30
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:04,141
告诉他们那里隐藏着一个人造物
Tell them we have an artificial object
out here hidden in the--

31
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:05,601
- 你确定是想说“隐藏的”？
- 在慧星之上
Are you sure you want
to say hidden?
Tell them it's located
in the head of the comet.

32
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:10,481
保持监控，直到确认
Keep sending that
until they acknowledge.

33
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,233
使用下面的保护连接
Use a secured downlink.

34
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,361
对不起，指挥官，在狂风中许多东西都看不清
Sorry, Commander, everything's
being swamped by the coma winds.

35
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,571
我们不能把任何物体作为参照
We can't get anything
back to base.

36
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:19,699
灯火管制有多久？
How long's the blackout period?

37
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,659
任何时候
All the way.

38
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,547
你要做什么？
What are you gonna do?

39
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,216
继续
We're going in.

40
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,887
我们要去争取机会，戴尔维次
We're only gonna get
one chance, Derebridge.

41
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,892
那个东西在以后76年内是不会回来了
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years.

42
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,811
那时我们都死了
And we'll both be dead.

43
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,772
所以我们不得不弄清楚
We have to take a look now.

44
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,826
- 把“那维”发动机…
- 关了
Shut down Nerva.

45
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,869
关闭
Shutting down.

46
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,704
Down one.

47
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:13,002
<i>Deltas plus one In two seconds.</i>

48
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,050
- 收回太阳能板
- 检查，给我一个读数，鲍伯
- Solar panels retracted.
<i>- Check.</i>
<i>Give me a readout, Bob.</i>

49
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:58,932
运行E.V.A. 演习

50
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:16,482
你希望它是从哪里来的？
Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

51
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,651
- 它在考察慧星吗？
- 继续，让我们了解它
Was it exploring the comet,
do you think?

52
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,948
它表面看起来有许多伤痕
Surface looks badly pitted.

53
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,950
这说明它在这里有很长时间了
In that case,
it's been here a long time.

54
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,119
遗弃物？或者是什么
It's derelict, whatever it is.

55
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,893
邱吉尔号，到一边去，我们正在过来

56
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,083
罗杰、卡尔森，我们知道了，准备进来
<i>Roger, Carlsen, we copy.</i>
<i>We have you going in.</i>

57
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:43,759
邱吉尔号，它看起来像一些巨大的、有机的动脉
Churchill, looks like
some sort of giant artery-- organic.

58
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,178
我觉得它以前一直在这里
I almost have the feeling
I've been here before.

59
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,685
哦，小伙子
Oh, boy.

60
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:01,184
真是难以置信

61
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,989
我希望你能感谢雷达上的影像
I hope you can appreciate
the scale of this on the video.

62
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,282
罗杰，我们抓住它了，都在带子上
<i>Roger, we're getting it.</i>
<i>It's all on tape.</i>

63
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,038
哦，他妈的
Oh, shit.

64
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,041
哇，它在那里
Well, here they are.

65
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:29,305
邱吉尔号
它看起来像我们发现的飞船的拥有者
Churchill, it looks like we found
the occupants of the ship.

66
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,810
它们看起来像蝙蝠，巨大的蝙蝠
They look like bats...giant bats.

67
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:48,198
- 一定有数以百计
- 是数以千计
<i>Churchill, there must be
hundreds of them.</i>
<i>Thousands...dead. I hope.</i>

68
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,510
我希望是死的

69
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,689
看起来像史前的

70
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,688
已经完全干燥了
It's completely desiccated.

71
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,446
- 弄得碎？
- 是的，应该可以
- <i>Crumbled.</i>
- Yes.
It would.

72
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,493
隔了这么多年，应该干了
All the fluid's been lost to space
over the years.

73
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,463
我会装一点放进袋子里带回去
We'll bag this one,
take it with us.

74
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,716
我们正在将样品装入袋中
<i>We're deploying
the specimen bag.</i>

75
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,286
看起来像某种正在伸展的巨大结构
<i>it looks like some sort
of big structure</i>
<i>that's just unfolding--
it's enormous!</i>

76
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,325
好大

77
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,086
天啊，是什么？
God, what is it?

78
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,594
我们快离开这里，长官
Better get out of here, sir.

79
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,513
谁也不可以离开，留在那里
Nobody's goin' anywhere,
stay where you are.

80
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:38,225
邱吉尔号，我是卡尔森，那边发生什么事？
Churchill, this is Carlsen.

81
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:39,393
那东西已经停止了
What's happening out there?
<i>The thing stopped opening.</i>

82
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:45,357
唯一可以描述它的是：像一支巨大的伞
<i>The only way to describe it is--
it's-- it's like a giant umbrella.</i>

83
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,569
- 上帝啊，大得无法形容
- 邱吉尔号
Good <i>god, it's--
it's absolutely enormous.</i>

84
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,946
它正在做什么？
Churchill, what's it doing now?

85
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,657
没做什么，长官
<i>Nothing, sir.</i>

86
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,163
它已停止扩展了
<i>It stopped opening.</i>

87
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,582
它就停在那里
<i>It's just sitting there.</i>

88
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,250
- 能告诉我它的成分吗？
- 不是金属的
Tell what it's made of?
<i>Not metal.</i>

89
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,337
雷达波可以透过
<i>It's radar transparent.</i>

90
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:13,927
好
如果它又开始展开，告诉我…
Okay...if it starts up again,
let me know.

91
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:16,138
它的任何活动，知道吗？
Any activity out there,
you understand?

92
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,598
是的，长官
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

93
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,149
我们要去哪里？
That's where we're goin'.

94
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,294
这里有些东西
Something there.

95
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,630
指挥官，我是邱吉尔号
<i>Commander,
this is Churchill.</i>

96
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,965
我们正在失去信号，
我们已经遗失V.T.R.
<i>We're losing our signal.</i>
<i>We've lost VTR.</i>

97
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,135
进来，指挥官！
<i>Come in, Commander.</i>

98
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:57,823
三具尸体
Bodies, three bodies.

99
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,741
保护好
Perfectly preserved.

100
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:05,747
他们看着我是像看着一个…
They look to me to be like in--

101
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:08,041
像我身上发生了什么变化
Something's happening to me.

102
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,377
我怎么了？
<i>What's wrong...</i>
<i>with me, wha--
what's wrong?</i>

103
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,187
指挥官
<i>Commander, come in.</i>

104
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,605
我是邱吉尔号，你听到了吗？
<i>This is Churchill.</i>
<i>Do you copy?</i>

105
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,697
他们看起来像某类假死，或是睡着了
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sleep.

106
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,365
稍等，我们正在下来
<i>Hold on, we're coming down.</i>

107
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:06,600
邱吉尔号，如果你看…
Churchill,
Churchill, if you read,

108
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,978
这里有两男一女，都是裸体的
there are two nude males
and one female.

109
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:13,065
这是邱吉尔号，我们没有照像机，汤姆
<i>This is Churchill,
we have no picture.</i>
Come <i>in, Tom.</i>

110
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:19,863
邱吉尔号，我说我们发现了一个年轻女孩
Churchill...l said we found
a young girl.

111
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:22,991
“女孩”？ 你是指人类？
<i>Girl?
You mean human?</i>

112
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,202
完美的人类
Definitely humanoid.

113
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,828
我说她是完美的
<i>I'd say she's perfect.</i>

114
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,997
我在空间站六个月了，
对我来说，她看起来十分完美
I've been in space for six months
and she looks perfect to me.

115
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,298
- 戴尔维次，怎么回事？
- 怎么回事？
<i>Derebrldge, what's wrong?</i>
What's wrong...

116
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,064
你想要收回多少？我说收回三分之…
How many
do you want to take back?
I say we take back all three.

117
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,362
死的在另一间房中
One of the dead things
in the other chamber.

118
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,531
看看我们是否能够恢复他们
Well...

119
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,116
let's so.
If we can break 'om fr“.

120
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:24,177
（三十天后）

121
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,514
邱吉尔号，进来，这是英国任务控制中心
<i>Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.</i>

122
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,599
你听到了吗？
<i>Do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.</i>

123
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,394
如果我们是来接他们的，
他们应该离我们近点
If they're going to pick us up,
they should get us this close.

124
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,646
没有收到信号，柯斯基博士
<i>Simply aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.</i>

125
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:38,525
飞船没有反应
Automatic circuits
don't even respond.

126
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,652
他们的无线电静默
They're radio dead.

127
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,446
上帝，我希望和他们通话
Christ.
I hope it's just
their communications.

128
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:46,366
<i>...do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.</i>

129
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,828
<i>Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.</i>

130
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,957
<i>Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.</i>

131
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,293
<i>Do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.</i>

132
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,377
他们的轨道正常吗？
How's their orbit look?

133
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:01,882
就要停靠了，但还差一点点
You can see it's stable,
but they're slightly off.

134
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,676
他们应该要调整一下
但是他们没有
They should have adjusted coming in,
but they haven't.

135
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,470
你在那做什么？
<i>What do you make of that?</i>

136
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,889
我希望重新设定他们的路线
<i>It would appear
that they, uh, set their course</i>

137
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,599
在离开慧星后，到现在还没有更新
<i>just after they left the comet.</i>
I'd say it hasn't been
updated since.

138
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,483
- 哥伦比亚号？
- 哥伦比亚号
The Columbia?

139
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,818
升空，我们正在升空
The Columbia.

140
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,280
<i>Lift of, we have lift off.</i>

141
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:31,563
安全，控制塔

142
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,716
控制中心，这是哥伦比亚号
Control, this is Columbia.

143
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,968
我们被清除入坞程序？
Are we clear
to initiate docking procedure?

144
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,596
往前飞，哥伦比亚号，你们飞行正常
<i>Go ahead, Columbia,
you are looking good.</i>

145
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,681
停在软垫旁
Stand by for soft dock.

146
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,810
软垫
<i>Soft dock.</i>

147
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,147
软垫确认
Soft dock confirmed.

148
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,598
哥伦比亚号，船完好无损
Columbia,
the ship's completely gutted.

149
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,224
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

150
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,643
休斯顿，有个问题，这里曾起过火
Houston, we have a problem.

151
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,520
There's been a fire.

152
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,527
我会看看
你们二个，试试顶上的甲板
I'll take a look in the tug bay.
You two try the top deck.

153
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,891
哥伦比亚号，他们都死了
<i>Columbia, they're all dead.</i>

154
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,769
哥伦比亚号，这里没什么，我准备进牵引坞
Nothing down here, Columbia.
I'm going on in to the tug bay.

155
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,150
我在拿磁带
I'll get the tapes.

156
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:01,580
- 我看到了
- 怎么除掉她的外壳？
I see-- how did you open
the girl's case?

157
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,124
我们不知道怎么开
We didn't, Minister.

158
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,042
我们正在讨论如何脱下外壳
We were just talking
about how to get it open
when it popped open
of its own accord.

159
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,046
- 你们将外壳照X光吗？
- 我们不确定是水晶做的
Did you x-ray the crystal cases?
We're not certain they're crystal.

160
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,091
外壳不是金属的，也不太像有机的
The casings are not metallic.

161
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,677
I'm not even sure they're organic.

162
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,763
外壳在那里，之前不是在那里
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there,

163
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,599
- 如果是真的…
- 那么人呢？
if that makes any sense.
And the bodies from the cases?

164
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,686
我们正准备解剖一个
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

165
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:28,773
当然可以，如果法拉达博士认为他们已死了
Provided, of course,
that Dr. Fallada agrees they're dead.

166
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,652
FaHada.

167
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,073
我不知道我是否有权力确定他们的死因
I don't know that I'm qualified
to pass judgment on alien death.

168
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:38,950
他们的存活机会难道比我们低吗？
You would agree
that they're less alive than we are?

169
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,039
昨天，香港黄金价格跌至谷底
<i>Yesterday
in Hong Kong, gold closed lower.</i>

170
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,043
欧洲的期货市场交易清淡…
<i>In light trading
on European currency markets,</i>

171
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,420
英磅对美元、马克的比价接近
<i>the pound closed mixed
against the dollar</i>
<i>and West German mark</i>

172
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,925
在稍后的新闻里，将公布市场报告
<i>There will be a full market report
after the late news.</i>

173
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,054
詹士葛兰姆从欧洲采访
<i>This is James Graham reporting
from the city.</i>

174
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,139
现在回到主播室
<i>Now back to the newsroom.</i>

175
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,896
<i>...developments as they arise.</i>

176
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,232
哈雷慧星从天空北部横过
<i>Halley's Comet is now dominating
the northern skies,</i>

177
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:13,485
在太空中延伸超过一亿公里
<i>stretching over a hundred million miles
across the heavens,</i>

178
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,613
在这格外地清静的夜晚…
<i>occupying one-sixth
of the entire visible horizon.</i>

179
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,074
地平线上六分之一的地方都可以看见
<i>On this exceptionally clear night,</i>

180
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,117
一群爱好者正在纪念
爱德蒙哈雷博士的重大发现…
<i>a group of enthusiasts are
commemorating</i>
<i>Dr. Edmond Halley's great prediction
by holding an outdoor watching</i>

181
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,748
在格林威治天文台创始时，
博士由手持望远镜观察到的
<i>from the site of his original
observatory at Greenwich.</i>

182
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,668
我们的观众可能对此感兴趣
<i>Our viewers may be interested
to know that comets</i>

183
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,337
慧星曾被认为是非常邪恶的
<i>were once considered
to be harbingers of evil,</i>

184
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,423
慧星最早的名字之一叫“灾祸”
<i>and that one of the earliest words
for comet was disaster,</i>

185
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,801
在拉丁文中的意思是“邪恶的星星”
<i>which in Latin means evil star.</i>

186
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:41,971
对深入宇宙考察的邱吉尔号来说
可能确实是邪恶的
<i>And it may indeed be an evil star
for the deep space probe, Churchill.</i>

187
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,265
尤其是在不能正确解释命运的王权时期
<i>There's still no word
from Her Majesty's Government</i>

188
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:47,152
不论他们是活还是死
<i>as to the fate of the crew,
whether they're alive or dead.</i>

189
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,813
我们只有等待进一步的研究
<i>We can only await
further developments.</i>

190
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,390
用我的身体
Use my body.

191
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,278
<i>Bukovsky.</i>

192
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,428
- 那个女郎在哪里？
- 她不见了
Bukovsky, where--
where's the girl!
She's gone.

193
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,517
我看见她了
<i>I saw her.</i>

194
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:03,149
这是她干的
She did that.

195
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,736
保安，法拉达教授在这里
<i>Security.</i>
Hello, Professor Fallada here.

196
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,949
我以柯斯基博士的名义命令
I'm calling at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

197
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,284
- 把船长安全守册给我
- 是的，先生
Get me the Duty Security Captain now.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

198
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,496
94号，控制中心，
你不会相信我看见了什么
Four nine to Control.

199
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,165
You'll never believe
what I'm looking at.

200
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,004
- 控制中心，你能再说一次吗？
- 我相信你听得到
Control, can you say that again?
<i>I believe you heard me.</i>

201
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,215
那个女孩在飞船中不见了，但绝对没有离开
<i>There's a girl on the loose
in the building.</i>
<i>She must not leave.</i>

202
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:13,594
对不起，我认为你说她是裸体的
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

203
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:15,388
是的，我是那么说的，当然，你能找她
<i>That's right, that's what I said.</i>

204
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,597
一定是笑话
<i>Surely, you can find her.</i>
Must be some kinda joke.

205
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,565
真不敢相信
I don't believe it.

206
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:30,278
姑娘，你要去哪里？
All right, Miss,
just stay where you are.

207
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,280
你听说了吗？他们说已抓住她
You heard 'em,
they said grab her.

208
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,533
放松点，伙伴，她应该是好人
Take it easy, Link,
she's not in her right mind.

209
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,953
控制中心，我们已在主厅里找到那个女孩
Control, Control, we have located
the girl in the main lobby.

210
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:42,290
就是她，快来
That's it, come on.

211
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,167
- 喂
- 我们已经找到那个女孩，先生
Yes.
<i>We've located the girl, sir.</i>

212
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,087
- 在哪？
- 她在楼下的主厅里
- Whore?
<i>- She's downstairs In the main lobby.</i>

213
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:49,547
好的
Right.

214
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:51,090
- 她在主厅里，你快下去
- 不
She's in the main lobby.

215
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,260
- You all right to go down there?
- No.

216
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,555
好的
Come on, nice and easy.

217
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,223
快点，过来
Come on.

218
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,559
Come to me.

219
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,561
到爸爸这里来
Come to daddy, come on.

220
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,656
让她住手
Make it stop, make it stop!

221
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,785
快点！我们抓住她！
<i>Come on, let's get her.</i>

222
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,583
- 还好吧，伙计？
- 还好
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah.

223
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:34,986
把非军事区的人都清走
<i>Will all non-involved
personnel please clear the area.</i>

224
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:40,408
重复：每个与此无关的人…
<i>I repeat-- Will everybody who has no
business to be here,</i>

225
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:44,328
请马上离开，到安全的地方去
<i>please clear the area
for your own safety.</i>

226
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:46,747
这是警察警告
<i>This is a police announcement.</i>

227
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:49,375
<i>Please keep right back--</i>

228
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,502
对不起，先生，不准照相，请…
<i>- Sony. gonthmon. no photos phat.
- Hun</i>

229
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,090
好
Sorry.

230
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,092
- 你们当中哪一个是柯斯基博士？
- 是我
May I ask which of you
is Dr. Bukovsky?

231
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,803
我是来自S.A.S.的肯上校
lam.
I'm Colonel Caine.

232
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:03,598
刚才的警告不是对大家的，
那只是一个D级警告
From the S.A.S.?
Gentlemen, that last remark
is not for publication.

233
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,602
This is a D Notice situation.

234
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,409
不要靠太近
Not too close.

235
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:30,791
这是凶杀案，你说呢？
And this was murder...
you say?

236
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,257
再说一遍，你是怎么被那个女孩制服的？
Tell me again how the girl
overpowered you.

237
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:43,179
她…
She, uh...

238
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,808
那是我从没见过的，最不可思议的女人
was the most overwhelmingly
effeminate presence
I've ever encountered.

239
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,146
- 我们没有那个本事
- 它是女的吗？
I was drawn to her
on a level that--

240
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:53,564
是的，不可思议
Was it sexual?
Yes, overwhelmingly so.

241
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,403
非常可怕
告诉控制中心，尽量降低损失
And horrible.

242
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:01,614
当你进来的时候卫兵就死了吗？
Loss of control.
And the man, the guard, was dead
when you came into the room?

243
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,117
- 当他在的時候，你看到他？
- 是的
You found him as he is now?
Yeah.

244
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,705
女孩来自邱吉尔号飞船？
And the girl, she came
from the ship, Churchill?

245
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,999
嗯
Uh-huh.

246
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,876
她跟你说过话，用英语？
She spoke to you?
In English?

247
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,129
是的
That's right.

248
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:18,798
她怎么会讲英语？
How would she know English?

249
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:21,217
回去就说飞船的磁带在火灾中损坏了
Now, going back--
you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire?

250
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:26,013
没有被损坏
No, they weren't destroyed
in the fire.

251
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:27,932
那我们怎么告诉人们他们的死因？
That's what we were told
to tell the public.

252
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,016
被“杀死”？
They were erased.

253
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:30,059
同时，飞船的逃生舱不见了
Erased?
Also, the Churchill's escape pod
is missing.

254
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:34,063
- 有人生还了吗？
- 我们不知道
What's that mean,
did someone escape?

255
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,231
他这样的身体状况，很不幸…
They don't know.
Unfortunately,
the condition of the bodies

256
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,027
不可能问到有用的东西
make an accurate count impossible.

257
00:29:40,027 --> 00:29:42,488
火焰的压力能够发射逃生舱吗？
Could the heat from the fire
have launched the pod?

258
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,073
<i>No, no, no.</i>

259
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:47,743
怎么起火的？
What started the fire?

260
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,457
飞船的氧气系统被引燃了，好大的火
The ship's oxygen system ignited.

261
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:56,168
It was a terribly hot fire.

262
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:59,755
你说的这些情况没有涉及到人形物体
Yet, you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

263
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,842
- 是的
- 你们在哪里发现的？
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?

264
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,678
在牵引坞，放太空拖船的地方
In the bay where the space tug
was stored.

265
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,263
别的都烧焦了
Where everything else
was charred.

266
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,683
让人难以置信，不是吗？
Incredible.
Is it not?

267
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,271
你已使用我们的技术调查了吗？
Have you examined the cases?

268
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,483
Using every technique we have.

269
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,528
X光扫描的结果得到的是模糊图像
X-ray scans of the cases
yield only blurred images.

270
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:23,654
- 那意味着什么？
- 他们不是物理对象
What does that mean?

271
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:26,824
They're not precisely physical objects.

272
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,701
比较像一个力场
More like a sort of force field.

273
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,871
这是我们力所不能及的
<i>We're a bit out of our depth here.</i>

274
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,247
是的，我知道，真是令人难以置信
<i>The whole thing is--</i>
Yes, I know.

275
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:36,083
Incredible.

276
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:39,170
他们对警卫做了尸体解剖吗？
我想不会
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard?
No, I suppose not.

277
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,506
那其他二个怎么样了？
What about your two other bodies?

278
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,678
上校，能原谅我吗？
Colonel, may I be excused?

279
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:50,431
似乎比我想象中的更令人作呕
I seem to be feeling a little more
nauseous than I thought.

280
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,390
是的
Yes, of course.

281
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:03,861
法拉达博士，从门上我注意到，
这是生物化学区
I notice from your door, Dr. Fallada,
that your area is biochemistry.

282
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,822
但是我知道你真正感兴趣的是…
But I understand
your real interest is--

283
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:09,200
是的，是死亡，肯上校
Death, Colonel Caine, correct.

284
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,369
死亡学
Thanatology is the name for it.

285
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,497
为你死是个政治问题
Death for you, Colonel, is a
bureaucratic problem-- who did it?

286
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,582
谁？ 何时？为什么？
When and why did they do it?

287
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,501
- 我对吗？
- 为你？
A problem to be solved,
am I correct?

288
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,877
我被死亡弄得神昏颠倒
And for you?
Well, I'm fascinated
by death itself--

289
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,839
当我们死后，会发生什么事？
在我们死之后，会发生什么事？
What happens as we die,
when we die.

290
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,216
- 你是指死亡后的生活？
- 是的
What happens after we die?

291
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,926
You mean, life after death.

292
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,177
死后的生活？
<i>Yes.</i>
- Is there?
- What?

293
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,513
<i>Life after death.</i>

294
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,766
你真的想要知道吗？
Do you really want to know?

295
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,476
不
No.

296
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:41,107
回答你的问题，是的，我是这样想的
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

297
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:45,152
如果我猜对了，生命力将一直被保存…
If I am correct,
the life force is conserved

298
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,488
而且，甚至所有的东西死亡之后
always and in all things,
even after death.

299
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,324
你认为会发生在今晚？
And you think that applies
to what's happened here tonight?

300
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:52,368
是的
Yes.

301
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,245
我想那个姑娘，人…
Yes, I do.
I think that girl, creature,

302
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,376
能量，生命力…
drained energy,
life force,

303
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:04,004
部份地来自柯斯基博士，其余的来自守卫
partially from Bukovsky
and totally from the guard.

304
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:05,965
- 就像一个吸血鬼？
- 可能只有那样形容
A vampire?

305
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,884
It could be described that way, yes.

306
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:10,886
在某种意义上，我们都是吸血鬼
I mean, in a sense,
we're all vampires.

307
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:13,973
我们从其它的生命形式汲取能量
We drain energy
from other life forms.

308
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,350
不同的是程度而已
The difference is one of degree.

309
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,645
那个姑娘不是人
That girl was no girl.

310
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:24,400
她是外星生物
She's totally alien to this planet
and our life form.

311
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,485
对我们的生命形式构成危险
And totally dangerous.

312
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,233
天啊，该死
Jesus.

313
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:08,652
- 你相信那些小子还活着吗？
- 我宁可不信
Do you believe those blokes are alive?
I'm not paid to believe nothing, am I?

314
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,826
我相信他们还活着
I believe they're alive.

315
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,998
不要让我看到血腥的场面
Don't look bloody dead to me.

316
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:17,429
我们有麻烦了，但还在控制之中
We've had some trouble,
but everything's under control.

317
00:34:18,138 --> 00:34:19,848
你要想知道得更多就到这里来
<i>I think you better
come down here.</i>

318
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,601
- 好的，长官
- 非常好
<i>Yes, sir...very good, sir.</i>

319
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:40,536
不要再发生这些，不能再有危险
It would appear these two
are no longer dangerous.

320
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,374
他们并没有被完全解剖
Well, there's certainly no possibility
of doing a full autopsy on them.

321
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,210
我要检查一下卫兵
I would like to examine the guard.

322
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,254
他们已开始检验卫兵的尸体了吗？
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

323
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,380
我相信如此
I believe so, sir.

324
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,885
这是一个年轻人，死了约两小时
This is an autopsy on the body
of a young man,
dead approximately two hours.

325
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:00,848
- 你说他只有二十多岁？
- 是的
Did you say he was about 20?
Yes, that's correct.

326
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,127
将上校放下来！
Get the Colonel down here,
quickly!

327
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,223
God.

328
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,934
快把他放到隔离房里！
Put him in an isolation cell,
quickly!
Sergeant.

329
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,163
我没办法了，他可能会死
I had no idea
that it could be passed on.

330
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,081
你想说什么？
What do you suggest?

331
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,710
我建议把他放在另一个隔离房里
I would recommend that you place
this body in another cell.

332
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,879
二个小时前卫兵受到了攻击
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

333
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:40,632
如果还在这里看到下一个，我不会觉得惊讶
I won't be at all surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

334
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:42,426
- 在他说话的時候，做你的事，凯利
- 是的，升官
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Yes, sir.

335
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,511
我在想被我们射中的那两个男的
Also, I want the two other bodies
that were shot-- the males.

336
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,305
收集这些碎片，检查一下
Collect the pieces and watch them.

337
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,890
- 打电话给英国内政大臣
- 好的
Get me the Home Secretary
on the line now.
Sir.

338
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,059
- 叫上校来
- 你已经叫了
Call for the Colonel, sir.

339
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:52,519
Sir, you have a call.

340
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,729
Caine.

341
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,522
<i>Sir, we've found
a naked girl in Hyde park.</i>

342
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:57,566
<i>The body is
in an indescribable condition.</i>

343
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,984
我马上就到
I'll be right there.

344
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,195
他们刚在海德公园发现了一个人，
一个裸体女人
They've just found a body
in Hyde Park.

345
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,362
他们说，她处在一种难以形容的状态下
A naked girl.
They say she's
in an indescribable condition.

346
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,992
那可能是你们遗失的女孩吗？
Could that be your girl?

347
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,245
- 哦？
- 那不是她
- Well?
- That's not her.

348
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,706
巡视员，那两个小伙怎么样？
Inspector, what about the two boys?

349
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:14,583
他们早就在公园里
Oh, yes, they were
in the park earlier, sir.

350
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,336
我想，我们可能更早就看到她了
Yeah, we saw her.
I think.

351
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,963
Earlier.

352
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,633
那看起来像她的头发
Any rate,
that looks like her hair.

353
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,262
No, that's why we notices her.

354
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:28,847
- 她和一个黑头发女子在一起
- 她们两个身上穿衣服吗？
She was with a dark haired girl.

355
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,309
她们真的好漂亮
Real good looking bird and all.
Didn't have a lot of clothes on either.

356
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,353
我们认为她们应该很好
We thought they might be--
well, you know.

357
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,646
哦，你看见黑头发姑娘到哪里去了？
Yes.
Well, did you see where they went,
where the dark haired girl went?

358
00:38:37,856 --> 00:38:39,942
没有看到
No, no, we didn't.

359
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,319
我们在她们后面转圈，
也许我们可以看见…
We angled on back
to see if maybe we could--

360
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,613
看她们在做什么
you know,
see 'em doing something.

361
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:47,825
- 我们什么时候发现她
- 是多久以前的事？
- That's when we found her.
- How long ago was that?

362
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,867
- 半个小时前
- 他打电话给我们，然后我们打电话给你
Half an hour ago.
Yeah, this lad phoned us
and then we phoned you, sir.

363
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:53,163
谢谢你，巡视员
Yes, thank you, Inspector.

364
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,876
显然，这是那个姑娘干的
Obviously, the work of the girl.

365
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:01,922
我们可以将这具及另外的尸体送回控制中心吗？
You think we can have this body sent
back to the center with the others?

366
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,549
好，那是个好主意
<i>Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.</i>

367
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:06,385
巡视员，发现别的东西就告诉我
Inspector, let me know if you find
anything else, will you?

368
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,761
- 我们会将她带回去
- 好的，长官
We'll be taking her back with us.
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

369
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,975
现在她有衣服了
Now she has clothes.

370
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:17,271
我想你看到了什么
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

371
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,993
汉斯·法拉达博士，珀西·赫塞尔廷爵士
和内政大臣
Dr. Hans Fallada, Sir Percy Heseltine,
the Home Secretary.

372
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,453
你们来得正是时候
You're just in time.

373
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,915
正好是两个小时
It's exactly two hours.

374
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,386
Please help me.

375
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:52,723
这是那个被太空女郎制服的卫兵
This is the guard who was originally
overcome by the space girl.

376
00:39:57,644 --> 00:39:59,062
Please.

377
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,525
Please.

378
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:31,386
开始转化时，我觉得好恐怖…
As I feared,
once transformed,

379
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:34,431
受害人必须注入能量…
the victims need
regular infusions of energy.

380
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:35,474
- 另外…
- 另外什么？
Otherwise--
Otherwise what?

381
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,458
哦，我的上帝，亲爱的上帝！
Oh, my God.

382
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:05,420
Dear God.

383
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,926
那个被卫兵攻击的病理学家
And down here we have the pathologist
who was attacked by the guard.

384
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:23,105
- 是吗？
- 他，也需要营养
- See.
- He too needs feeding.

385
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:42,165
我们在公园中看到的那个姑娘，
会发生相同的事情…
The same thing is going to happen
to that girl we found in the park.

386
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,584
大约一个小时
In about one hour.

387
00:43:05,487 --> 00:43:09,150
天哪！

388
00:43:17,844 --> 00:43:19,596
Have there been
any further reports, Kelly?

389
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:21,973
我们在这里公布情况时，
某人就立即来了
No, sir, we set up
to get the calls here

390
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:23,183
- 什么？
- 没什么
the instant one comes in.
- What?
- Nothing.

391
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,480
你说这些人是从邱吉尔号带回来的？
You say these creatures were brought
back from the Churchill?

392
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,898
是的，但不是这个，她也是受害者
Yes, sir, but not this one.
She's a victim of the creatures.

393
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,903
好，得到他们时邱吉尔号在哪里？
Yes, yes, but where did
the Churchill acquire them?

394
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,197
目前，我们无法确定
We have no way
of determining that at present.

395
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:39,491
- 也许都在发生变化
- 什么？
<i>- Perhaps that's all changing.</i>
- What?

396
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,285
我刚从美国帕萨迪纳州的J.P.L.收到一条消息
I've just received a call
from the JPL in Pasadena.

397
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:44,955
Seems the Goldstone tracking disc has
just picked up something

398
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,082
他们说邱吉尔号的逃生仓已返回地球
they think is Churchill's escape pod--

399
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,709
- 在哪个地方？
- 德克萨斯州
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

400
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:51,128
Where?

401
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,462
Texas.

402
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,431
Come on, guys, hurry It up.

403
00:44:18,613 --> 00:44:20,532
All right, take it easy now.

404
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,783
Hey, buddy, you all right?

405
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,497
哪里？瓦尔特雷德陆军医院？
Where?
Walter Reed Army Hospital?

406
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,209
他受伤了吗？好像很疲惫
Is he hurt?

407
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:32,627
该死，到那里去！
Just exhausted, you say.
Well, get him the hell over here!

408
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,885
- 卡尔森上校呢？
- 他在等你们
Colonel Carlsen,
they're expecting you, sir.

409
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:43,638
卡尔森上校
Colonel Carlsen, sir.

410
00:44:45,098 --> 00:44:46,349
汤姆
<i>Tom.</i>

411
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,314
我认为你已经死了呢
I thought you were dead.

412
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:54,274
Bukovsky.

413
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,943
让我介绍一下，这位空军勤务处的肯上校
Colonel Carlsen,
allow me to introduce
Colonel Caine
of the Special Air Services.

414
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,032
You already know Dr. Fallada.

415
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,116
Colonel.

416
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,702
来，坐下
Take a seat, won't you?

417
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,709
我很抱歉在这种情况下叫你们来
I'm sorry to drag you
over here like this, Tom.

418
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:15,295
相信你们宁愿与漂亮的护士在一起
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

419
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,009
我们必须知道邱吉尔号上发生了什么
Tom, we've got to know
what happened on the Churchill.

420
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,385
嗯，当然
Yes, of course.

421
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:31,061
对你们来说，那可能非常困难…
我准备说，要接受…
It may be, uh...very difficult for you
to accept what I'm going to say.

422
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,563
相信你们要告诉我们所有的事，会有一点困难
We'll have very little difficulty

423
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,315
believing anything
you have to tell us, Colonel.

424
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,733
- 继续
- 你已知道什么？
Do go on.

425
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,568
在邱吉尔号上，起火了
You know something?
There was a fire
aboard the Churchill.

426
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,281
你可能对三个人型生物感兴趣…
You might be interested to know

427
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:46,493
不被大火烧毁
that the bodies of the three humanoids
were not destroyed in that fire.

428
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,328
让他们在火灾中幸免于难
<i>They survived in their</i> cases.

429
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,705
把他们带到伦敦，但女的已经逃脱
They were brought
down here to London,
and the female has escaped.

430
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,084
她已经杀三个人了
<i>She's killed three people already.</i>

431
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,212
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

432
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:02,342
因为时间紧急，
所以无论如何，你必须告诉我们…
So you see, Colonel, whatever
you have to tell us is rather pressing.

433
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,469
告诉我们发生了什么
Please tell us what happened.

434
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,891
我们发现这些人形物体来自外太空的飞船
We found the bodies
aboard the alien spacecraft.

435
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:12,060
什么，外太空的飞船？
What alien spacecraft?

436
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,564
上校，一开始就这样猜的
Colonel, take it
from the beginning.

437
00:46:16,564 --> 00:46:18,400
保守地说，假设我们对那些麻烦一无所知
Assume we know nothing.
Which is understating the matter.

438
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,907
我们在距哈雷慧星9000英里
内接近了哈雷慧星
We approached within 9,000 miles
of Halley's Comet,

439
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,205
在昏睡的慧星里发现了某个东西
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

440
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:35,542
我们发现这些人形物体后，
将他们带到了邱吉尔号上
<i>After we discovered
the bodies,</i>
<i>we transferred them
to the Churchill.</i>

441
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,796
我们找到三个像人的生物
还有一些像蝙蝠的东西
We have in tow,
the three humanoid creatures
and one of the bat-like things.

442
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,924
这是邱吉尔号，欢迎你们回来
<i>This is Churchill, we copy.</i>
<i>Welcome back.</i>

443
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,511
罗林斯，准备返回地球了吗？
You gotten through
to Earth yet, Rawlings?

444
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:49,556
不，长官，慧星尾部的的温度在升高
No, sir, and the tail
of the comet's heating up.

445
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:55,979
- 戴尔维次，为什么会那样？
- 我不知道，汤姆
What's the matter Derebridge?
I don't know, Tom.

446
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,983
我觉得在消耗能量
I feel drained.

447
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,234
你？
Do you?

448
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,738
我感到很鼓舞
你没事吧？
I feel invigorated.
You okay?

449
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,241
- 我很好
- 好
Yeah.

450
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,453
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

451
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,041
每个人都会回到空间站
Everybody back
to their stations.

452
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,502
把我们从这里受的罪赶走
Let's get the hell outta here.

453
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:28,303
在回地球的路上，队员开始死亡…
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die--

454
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,929
一个接一个
one by one.

455
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:38,521
罗林斯…
无线电船员，第一个去世
Rawlings, the radio officer,
was the first to go.

456
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,994
罗林斯不承认他做了什么
<i>Rawlings denied any knowledge
of what he had done.</i>

457
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:54,454
我不记得
I don't remember.

458
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:57,540
罗林斯
Rawlings,

459
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,252
除我之外，在前一个小时，你是唯一没睡的
besides myself, you're the only one
that's been up here
in the last hour.

460
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,341
我最近觉得很虚弱…
I've been feeling weak recently.

461
00:48:06,591 --> 00:48:08,176
不是我自己
Not myself.

462
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,138
真的记不起来
Just don't remember.

463
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,657
第二天，我们发现罗林斯的尸体
<i>We found Rawlings' body
the next day.</i>

464
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:43,253
如何是好？
他死了吗，上校？
Exactly how did he die, Colonel?

465
00:48:44,045 --> 00:48:46,256
他只是耗尽了生命
The life just drained out of him.

466
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:53,596
一个接一个…
<i>One by one...</i>

467
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,643
其他的队员也开始死亡
<i>the rest of the crew
began to die.</i>

468
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,940
不知何故…
<i>Somehow...</i>

469
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,278
我不知道该怎么办…
<i>I don't know how...</i>

470
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,949
我幸存下来了
<i>I held out.</i>

471
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:19,289
我觉得将会有麻烦
<i>It just seemed to be
a matter of will.</i>

472
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,417
我一直在想…
<i>I always thought...</i>

473
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,257
那个姑娘…
<i>The girl...</i>

474
00:49:30,508 --> 00:49:32,719
啊？ 女孩？
Yes, the girl?

475
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,269
我记不起了
<i>I can't remember.</i>

476
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:59,287
我记得下一个…
从控制室窗户往外看…
<i>What I remember next is the view
out of the observation window--</i>

477
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,915
在进入地球轨道前
<i>coming in to Earth's orbit.</i>

478
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,879
我不能让带回去的东西伤害到地球
<i>I couldn't expose the world
to what we'd brought back with us.</i>

479
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:30,753
于是我决定把他们全部毁掉
<i>I was determined
to destroy them all.</i>

480
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,658
这是我做过的最难做的决定
It was the hardest thing
I ever did.

481
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:02,118
能够理解
We understand.

482
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,996
下这个决心需要很大的勇气
Must have taken great courage
to try and make--

483
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,581
不，你不了解
No, you don't understand.

484
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:09,751
我的一部份不想离开
Part of me didn't wanna leave.

485
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:14,172
她杀了我所有的朋友，
而我仍然不想离开
She killed all my friends
and I still didn't want to leave.

486
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:17,884
离开她是我做过的最难做的事
Leaving her was
the hardest thing I ever did.

487
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:24,265
卡尔森上校看起来很疲惫
Colonel Carlsen
looks exhausted to me.

488
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:26,893
我们应该让他睡一会，稍后再继续
I think we should allow him
to get some sleep.

489
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,478
好
Continue with this later.
Very well.

490
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,358
谢谢你，上校
<i>Thank you, Colonel.</i>

491
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,638
美国航空航天局追踪我们和我们的…
NASA tracking and ours

492
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:08,017
才离开哈雷慧星，报告不同寻常的结构
have just reported and unusual
structure leaving Halley's Comet.

493
00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:10,561
What is it?

494
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,108
目标的雷达扫描结果
Radar ranging reports
the object is a needle-like shape,

495
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,818
针状物体，150英里长
one hundred and fifty miles long.

496
00:53:17,568 --> 00:53:20,196
它的运行路线对准了地球的轨道…
<i>Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit</i>

497
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,073
在一两天内
<i>in a little more than two days.</i>

498
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,702
我刚刚接到总理的电话
Oh, and I've just received a call
from the Prime Minister.

499
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:28,955
准备在唐宁街开一个会
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

500
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,040
总理想要知道答案
PM wants answers.

501
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,193
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

502
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,787
你正在把你的生活给我
You're giving me your life.

503
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,174
你正拥有它
You're taking it.

504
00:55:27,114 --> 00:55:28,741
我的生命力在外泄
You're draining me.

505
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,578
你拿我的太多了
You're taking too much of me.

506
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:00,439
只是一个梦
It was a dream.

507
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:01,691
- 做的什么梦？
- 那个姑娘，她来看我了
Just a dream.
What dream, Carlsen?

508
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,444
The girl, she visited me.

509
00:56:05,444 --> 00:56:07,738
来看你？怎么啦？
Visited you,
visited you how?

510
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,198
在我的脑海里
In my mind.

511
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,995
她…她和我有某种类型的思想沟通
She...she...she...
she had some kind
of mental contact with me.

512
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,875
她正汲取我的精力
She's draining me.

513
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,793
将那个梦告诉我们
Tell us about the dream, Carlsen.

514
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:24,797
我记不清了
I can't, it's gone.

515
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:27,258
记不清了
It's faded.

516
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,096
你介意试一次吗？
Carlsen, have you ever
been hypnotized?
No.

517
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:33,306
Do you mind
if I have a go at it?

518
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,182
It may help you
with your dreams.

519
00:56:35,182 --> 00:56:37,351
好，试一试
Yeah, let's try it.

520
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,021
- 现在不行，他太疲惫了
- 好的，那就在明早
Not now, he's too exhausted.
Fine, fine, in the morning.

521
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:45,443
盯着它，正到眼睛有点累，然后闭上眼睛
Just stare at it
until your eyes feel tired.

522
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,861
你感到非常疲累，好想睡觉
Then close them.
You'll feel very tired.

523
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:52,074
Very sleepy.

524
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:53,784
她似乎在梦中和我说话
She seems to...

525
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,705
speak to me in my dreams.

526
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,834
她…
She...

527
00:57:02,835 --> 00:57:05,963
那个姑娘…
我觉得…
the girl, I feel...

528
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,175
你觉得她什么？
What do you feel
for her, Carlsen?

529
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:13,220
我觉得非常…
I feel very...

530
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,014
靠近她
close to her.

531
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,724
她在摸你吗？
Is she in touch with you?

532
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:19,644
我想是的
I feel...

533
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:22,563
好像我的灵魂…
as if my mind...

534
00:57:23,814 --> 00:57:26,067
不完全是我自己的
is not entirely my own.

535
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:29,403
如果她接触到你的灵魂…
If she is in contact
with your mind, Carlsen,

536
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:31,697
也许你正在跟她接触
perhaps you are
in contact with hers.

537
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:34,116
你看见她吗？
Can you see her?

538
00:57:34,867 --> 00:57:36,702
你能见到她在哪里吗？
<i>Can you see where she is?</i>

539
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,499
<i>Where is she now, Carlsen?</i>

540
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:45,127
一个地方，我不知道地名
<i>A place, I don't know
the name of it.</i>

541
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:46,921
她正在走路
<i>She's walking.</i>

542
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:50,591
有着一张不同的脸…
<i>She has a different face.</i>

543
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,301
但是确实是她
<i>But it's her.</i>

544
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:54,804
“一张不同的脸”？那是为什么？
<i>A different face,
how can that be?</i>

545
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,514
她在使用一个不同的身体
<i>She's using a different body.</i>

546
00:57:57,723 --> 00:57:59,350
- 她在做什么？
- 在找一个男人
<i>What is she doing?</i>
<i>She's looking for a man.</i>

547
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,728
什么男人？
<i>What man?</i>

548
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:05,064
任何男人，一个健康的男人
Any man.

549
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,774
- 她想要杀他吗？
- 不
A healthy man.
<i>Does she intend to kill him?</i>

550
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:10,569
- 为什么不？
- 她害怕被抓住
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>
<i>She's afraid of being caught.</i>

551
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:14,031
她怎会被抓住的？身体会出卖她
<i>How could she be caught?</i>

552
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,574
她想做什么？
<i>The body'd give her away.</i>
<i>So, what Is she hoplng to do?</i>

553
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,412
她想要…
<i>She wants to...</i>

554
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:22,081
从他那里汲取一些能量
<i>draw some energy from him.</i>

555
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:24,959
不是完全地杀死他
<i>Not enough to kill him.</i>

556
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,669
- 她能做得到？
- 是的
<i>She can do that?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

557
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,339
还有个另外的想法
<i>There's another mind.</i>

558
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,925
是的
<i>Yes...</i>

559
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:36,846
姑娘的名字…
叫亚伦
the girl's name is Ellen.

560
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,557
有二个人在一个身体中？
You mean there are
two people in one body?

561
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,017
二个灵魂？
<i>Two minds?</i>

562
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,228
亚伦和吸血鬼？
Ellen and the vampire?

563
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:45,771
是的
Yes.

564
00:58:48,315 --> 00:58:50,026
她正在看一个男人
<i>She's watching a man.</i>

565
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:52,153
那男的在做什么？
<i>What is the man doing?</i>

566
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,072
停下车，在做些什么
<i>He's parked--</i>
<i>Doing something with his car.</i>

567
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:00,536
车子牌照
License number.

568
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,124
你能看到车牌号码吗？
Can you see
the license number of his car?

569
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,625
看得到
Yes.

570
00:59:09,962 --> 00:59:11,922
<i>F-M-C</i>

571
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,093
129E…
<i>1-2-9-E.</i>

572
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:18,888
或者R
Or, uh...R.

573
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,681
汽车是什么牌子的？
<i>What is the make of the car?</i>

574
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,145
白色的沃尔沃
<i>A white Volvo.</i>

575
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:31,192
她现在在干什么？
<i>What is she doing now?</i>

576
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,947
<i>Does she ask him his name?</i>

577
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,617
她在拉她的裙子…
<i>She's...</i>

578
00:59:40,993 --> 00:59:43,037
<i>pulling her skirt...</i>

579
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,790
拉到膝盖上方
<i>over her knees.</i>

580
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:48,667
她是…
<i>She's...</i>

581
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:50,920
他是…
<i>He's...</i>

582
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,589
把他的…
<i>putting his...</i>

583
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,135
手放在大腿上
<i>his...</i>
<i>hand...</i>

584
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,639
<i>on her le-- on her leg.</i>

585
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:19,782
FMC129E或者可能是R
F-M-C-1-2-9-E or possibly R,

586
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,867
一辆白色的沃尔沃
belonging to a white Volvo.

587
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:24,203
汽车司机搭载了一个叫做亚伦的姑娘
The driver of the car picked up
a girl named Ellen.

588
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,956
我必须知道那个姑娘是谁
以及能在哪里找到她
I have to know who the girl is
and where we can find her.

589
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,041
她与上述情况有关
She's connected with the case.

590
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,460
车在路上开，我说不清了
谢谢
I can't explain
over an open line.

591
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,337
Thank you.

592
01:00:34,588 --> 01:00:36,882
你认为他说了实话吗？
Do you think he's telling
the truth about the girl?

593
01:00:36,882 --> 01:00:38,801
再见
Well, we'll soon see.

594
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:43,556
好厉害啊，她能从一个身体动到另一个身体
从一个灵魂到另一个灵魂…
How brilliant if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind.

595
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,976
只要从每个受害者取得少部分能量
Taking only a small amount
of energy from each victim.

596
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,229
那会更有意思，我们不会再发现新的受害者
It would make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

597
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,981
如果她没有痕迹地离开
She's hoping
to leave no trail.

598
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,192
如果那个姑娘不是在她最初的身体里，
她的身体在哪里？
If the girl is no longer
in her original body,
where is her body?

599
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,821
- 藏起来了
- 那我们找找看
Hidden.
Let's find it.

600
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,160
假如这些猜测是对的
Supposing you're right
about all of this,

601
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,744
那艘船在那里干嘛？它正做什么？
what about that ship up there?

602
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:07,705
我们不知道，但是我们想像最坏的结果
What's it doing?
We can't know that.

603
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,001
But we've got
to assume the worst.

604
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,378
也许是传说中的吸血鬼
Maybe they're like
the vampires of legend.

605
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:15,337
怎么是那个？
How's that?

606
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,132
他们会用棺材运他们到地球来
They would carry
their earth with them--

607
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,801
他们不会？
in their coffins, wouldn't they?

608
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,973
- 我们有来自夏威夷的食物
- 它来这里了
<i>We have
a three meter feed from Hawaii.</i>

609
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,725
- 把它放在一号屏幕
- 从240000英里开始
<i>Here it</i> comes.
<i>Put It on screen number one.</i>

610
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:34,565
Coming in 240,000 miles.

611
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:36,984
我的天啊，好大
My God, it's immense.

612
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:01,717
休，你有皮纸吗？
I say, Hugh, do you have
that skin tissue sample I asked for?

613
01:02:01,717 --> 01:02:02,801
好
Oh, good.

614
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:05,804
好的，我会一直跟踪
Yes, of course I'll follow
containment procedure.

615
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,851
And Hugh,
send in that soldier, please.

616
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,522
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

617
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:50,099
法拉达博士
Dr. Fallada?

618
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,475
一会见，警官，谢谢
Just one moment, Sergeant.
Thank you for coming around.

619
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,145
不久又会见面的
I'll be with you shortly.

620
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:08,617
追踪那辆车是血腥的、糟糕的工作
Bloody awful job,
tracing that car.

621
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:11,870
他名叫奈德·埔莱，住在约克郡
It belongs to a man named Ned Price
who lives in Yorkshire.

622
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:13,831
- 我们已拘留他了
- 那个姑娘呢？
We have him
under detention now.

623
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:14,873
正如你所说，
他说他搭载的姑娘是个叫亚伦的护士
What about the girl?
The girl he picked up was
a nurse named Ellen.

624
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,628
As you said,
EIIen-something-or-other.

625
01:03:20,921 --> 01:03:23,173
And he dropped her off
at Thurlstone Hospital

626
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:25,050
after spending
the afternoon with her.

627
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,969
他不愿意谈这些，那个男的很累
He was most reluctant
to talk about it.
The man's totally exhausted.

628
01:03:29,346 --> 01:03:30,931
是不是在精神病收容所？
Thurlstone.
Isn't that an asylum
of some sort?

629
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,936
是的，为患精神病的罪犯准备的
Yes, for the criminally insane.

630
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:41,146
（芙尔斯通医院）

631
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:01,295
你好吗？我是阿姆斯壮医生，医院的院长
How do you do, Home Secretary,
I'm Dr. Armstrong,
director of the hospital.

632
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:04,506
到我办公室来谈
Come with me to my office.

633
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,721
- 一个寒冷的夜晚
- 好冷
What a cold night.
Bitterly cold.

634
01:04:13,098 --> 01:04:14,558
这是护士的房子
This is the nurse's house.

635
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,896
埃伦·唐纳森住在五号
Ellen Donaldson is number five.

636
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,314
谢谢
Thank you.

637
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,025
我们要不要讨论一下，并介绍一下你？
Shouldn't I come up
and introduce you?

638
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,109
- 不要了
- 跟我来，阿姆斯壮医生
I'd rather you didn't.

639
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:25,235
我还有些事要与你谈谈
Come along, Dr. Armstrong,
you and I have several matters
to discuss.

640
01:04:26,987 --> 01:04:28,197
Come along.

641
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,495
喂？你是谁？
<i>Yes, who is it?</i>

642
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,413
我叫科林·肯，阿姆斯壮医生带我来的
Miss Donaldson,
my name's Colin Caine.

643
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:37,915
我想和你谈谈，可以进来吗？
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.
Id' like to talk to you.

644
01:04:39,124 --> 01:04:40,292
May I come in?

645
01:04:49,968 --> 01:04:51,220
你好
Yes?

646
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:54,723
- 你要问什么？
- 我叫科林·肯
What do you want?

647
01:04:54,723 --> 01:04:55,974
这是美国空军卡尔森上校
My name's Colin Caine.
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.

648
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,938
我们可以进来和你说话吗？
我们已经见过阿姆斯壮医生
May we come in
and talk to you?
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

649
01:05:12,699 --> 01:05:13,951
可以坐下吗？
May I sit down?

650
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,957
我想问一下，与你一起吃午饭的，
名叫奈德·埔莱男子的事
I want to ask you about the man
you spent the afternoon with,
Ned Price.

651
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,587
- 我不知道你在说什么
- 我想你知道
I don't know
what you're talking about.

652
01:05:25,587 --> 01:05:27,339
- 让我看见你的手
- 对不起，你想…
<i>I think you do.</i>
Let me see your hand.

653
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:29,925
Beg your pardon?

654
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,598
你在那里，不是吗？
You're in there, aren't you?

655
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:40,102
- 我不知道你在说什么
- 告诉我
I don't know.
Tell me.

656
01:05:41,311 --> 01:05:42,396
No!

657
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,565
Carlsen!

658
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,528
她已经从她这里离开了，
现在在另外一个人的身体中
It's gone from her,
it's in another body now.

659
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,654
你如何知道的？
我能够看到，在她的脑海里
How do you know that?
I can see it in her mind.

660
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,577
她正在反抗，我要强迫她告诉我
She's resisting.
I'm gonna have
to force her to tell me.

661
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:02,249
不论外表，这个婊子喜欢被虐待狂
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

662
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:04,418
一个极端的被虐待狂
An extreme masochist.

663
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,795
她想我用武力从她那里得到什么
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

664
01:06:07,796 --> 01:06:09,715
她想要我伤害她
She wants me to hurt her.

665
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:12,426
我可以从她脑海里看见图像
你想留一会吗？
I can see the images
in her mind.
Do you want to stay?

666
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,471
我在外面等，我不是个窥淫狂
Otherwise, wait outside!
Not at all.

667
01:06:16,638 --> 01:06:18,557
I am a natural voyeur.

668
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,105
你进去吗？
Are you in there?

669
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,741
你在那里吗？
Are you there?

670
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,331
去吧
Let go.

671
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,000
现在
Now!
Now!

672
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,377
Now!

673
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,764
I've got a physical description.

674
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,233
最好叫人去照料唐纳森护士
Doctor, you'd better send someone
to look after Nurse Donaldson.

675
01:07:52,442 --> 01:07:54,987
If I described one of the inmates
to you, could you identify him?

676
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,321
可以
Possibly.

677
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,533
大块头、肥胖、白头发、脸上有胎记
Big man, fat, gray hair.

678
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:00,826
杰弗里·赛克斯，婴儿杀手
你是如何知道的？
Birthmark on his face.
Jeffrey Sykes,
the child murderer.

679
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:05,497
Where did you get
his description?

680
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:07,583
- 他现在在哪里？
- 在单独监禁房里
Where is he now?
He's in solitary confinement.

681
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,754
Look, what is this about?

682
01:08:12,754 --> 01:08:14,256
- 我们可能在这里呆一段时间
- 最好呼叫伦敦
What we're looking for
has moved.
We could be here some time.

683
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,342
- 可以用你的电话吗，医生？
- 当然可以
I better call London.
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.

684
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:21,722
- 我们现在必须看到赛克斯
- 不能一直等到早晨吗？
We have to see Sykes now.
Oh, couldn't this wait
until the morning?

685
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:27,185
好的，我安排下
Oh, all right, I'II arrange it.

686
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:29,146
你要对所有事负责，指挥官
Anything to oblige,
Commander.

687
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:38,071
我不希望如此神秘
I wish this were not
so mysterious.

688
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:41,617
如果与警察有关，我有权知道吗？
If the police are involved,
haven't I a right to know?

689
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,119
如果你要对我的病人胡闹…
I mean, if you're going to start
messing about my patient.

690
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:50,292
阿姆斯壮医生，我当然赞成你的立场
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

691
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:54,212
然而，我可以告诉你，这关系到国家安全
However, I can tell you it is a matter
of national security.

692
01:08:54,212 --> 01:08:55,714
我知道
I see.

693
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:59,217
你认为不应该给我介绍…
But, don't you think
that I should be present in any case

694
01:08:59,217 --> 01:09:01,178
试探我的耐心？
to represent the interests
of my patient.

695
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:03,138
- 你知道…
- 我可以与你单独谈谈吗？
- You <i>300--
-</i> Can I talk to you for a second?

696
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:04,222
可以
Of course.

697
01:09:04,222 --> 01:09:08,185
他只有四岁孩子的智商
Uh...the man has the IQ
of a child of four.

698
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:10,395
那意味着我应该顺从肯上校吗？
Well, that's a decision,
I'm afraid,

699
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:12,272
I shall have to defer
to Colonel Caine.

700
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:13,815
是的，当然是的，你可以在一起来
我们可以开始了吗？
Yes, of course
you can come along.

701
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:15,150
- 你要对他做什么？
- 我想对他施催眠术
Can we start now?
What are you going
to do to him?

702
01:09:17,861 --> 01:09:19,237
I'd like to hypnotize him.

703
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,242
那是什么？
What's that?

704
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:26,787
喷妥撒（钠）和吗啡
Pentothal and morphine.

705
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:30,540
为管理病人、预备催眠状态用的
I'd recommend it for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

706
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,262
嗯，他看起来很安静
Well, he seems quiet.

707
01:09:45,305 --> 01:09:46,765
你准备好我们就开始，拉姆森
We're ready when you are.

708
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,558
长官
- Lamson.
- Sir.

709
01:10:12,332 --> 01:10:13,959
打针会有危险吗？
Can the injection be dangerous?

710
01:10:14,584 --> 01:10:16,962
他应该能够忍受
He should have
no difficulty tolerating it.

711
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,296
总要冒点险，长官
<i>There's always a risk, sir.</i>

712
01:10:20,298 --> 01:10:21,508
我要打那个？
<i>May I have that?</i>

713
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,428
我准备叫醒他
Well, I'll wake him up.

714
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:29,391
- 你们在干什么？！
- 停下来
- What are you doing!
- Stay where you are.

715
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,310
他生病了，拉姆森，
帮帮我们，我现在无法解释
He's sick, Lamson, help us,
I can't explain now.

716
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:37,482
这里有凶手，珀西爵士
There's our killer, Sir Percy.

717
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,388
真是疯了
It's madness.

718
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:12,184
我想问他，可以在哪里找到她？
I want to question him
before it wears off.

719
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,518
在坡道上，长官
Where can we take him?
Up the ramp, sir.

720
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,665
我们要独处一会
We need to be alone
for a minute, Lamson.

721
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,635
你知道他怎么样了？
How the devil
did you know it was him?

722
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,387
在护士的住处，他用肩碰了我
In the nurses quarters
he touched me on the shoulder.

723
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,766
我在他的脑海看到的
I saw into his mind.

724
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:58,772
The Colonel appears to be able
to see in the minds

725
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:02,067
先生，在那女孩的身体旁，谁能够保持镇静
of people who have been possessed
by the girl creature, sir.

726
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,319
当我触碰他的时候，就发生了
把他抱到桌上
It happens when I touch 'em.

727
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:08,406
Let's get him on the table.

728
01:12:16,873 --> 01:12:18,083
怎么样？
How?

729
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,753
你怎么知道她仍然在阿姆斯壮院长身体里？
How do you know
she's still inside Armstrong?

730
01:12:21,753 --> 01:12:24,297
有什么可以阻止她移动到其他人？
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone else?

731
01:12:24,297 --> 01:12:26,967
她被困住
She's trapped.

732
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,635
我能感觉到
I can feel that.

733
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,095
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

734
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,306
不
No.

735
01:12:37,894 --> 01:12:39,396
- 拉姆森
- 长官？
- Lamson.
- Sir?

736
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,231
- 给我一份麻醉剂
- 一份常量的麻醉剂，长官？
Can you bring me another dose
of the hypnotic drug?
I suppose so, sir.

737
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,693
- 这不同寻常
- 这东西可以持续多久？
One dose is usually enough.
This is not a usual situation.

738
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:49,114
- 一份剂量？
- 一份剂量一小时
How long does the stuff last?
A dose like that?

739
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:51,324
我们一定会需要更多
A couple of hours.

740
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:54,077
We'll definitely need more.

741
01:12:54,744 --> 01:12:56,621
- 给我三份剂量
- 三份？！
Bring me three doses.

742
01:12:56,621 --> 01:12:58,665
我会负责，你只要拿过来
- Three?
- I'll take responsibility, Lamson--
Sir Percy and myself,
just get on with it.

743
01:13:01,751 --> 01:13:03,128
好的，长官
Yes, sir.

744
01:13:05,213 --> 01:13:06,882
三份剂量是否安全？
Is a second dose safe?

745
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,884
确实会损害他的心脏
Surely it can strain his heart.

746
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:12,888
瞧，你不知道我们正在处理
Look...you don't know
what we're dealing with here.

747
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:15,891
如果她摆脱了会很危险，她会逃跑
If he slips out from under,

748
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,518
<i>she'“ escape.</i>

749
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:35,619
阿姆斯壮
你听到吗？
Armstrong, can you hear me?

750
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:40,874
阿姆斯壮，如果你听到，就说好
Armstrong, if you can hear me,
just say yes.

751
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,839
It...

752
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,175
如果不想我…
won't let me...

753
01:13:51,092 --> 01:13:54,262
和你说话
ta-- talk to you.

754
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:15,325
阿姆斯壮，阿姆斯壮
Armstrong,
Armstrong!

755
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,370
如果你知道谁是控制你的人？
Can you see what it is
that's holding you prisoner?

756
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:25,377
知道，是她
Yes, yes, she--

757
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,087
告诉她，她必须和我说话！
Tell her she has
to talk to me!
Tell her!

758
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:29,798
进来
Yes?

759
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,387
我带来了喷妥撒（钠）
Pentothal,
I brought the pentothal.

760
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:37,055
谢谢，这是全部的
Thanks, Lamson, that'll be all.

761
01:14:42,894 --> 01:14:44,562
No.

762
01:14:44,562 --> 01:14:45,772
抓住他
Hold him.

763
01:14:53,738 --> 01:14:55,490
这里不需要那些
There's no need for that.

764
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,326
No need.

765
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,468
你在那里吗？你还能听到吗？
<i>You in there,</i>

766
01:15:16,594 --> 01:15:17,971
can you still hear me?

767
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:23,351
你能进入他的脑海，她的脑海？
Can you get into his mind?
Her mind?

768
01:15:23,351 --> 01:15:25,645
不要用这种麻药，它像一面墙
Not with this drug,
it's like a wall.

769
01:15:25,645 --> 01:15:27,439
也许打多了
Perhaps you've given him
too much.

770
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,315
住嘴
- Perhaps we--
- Shut up!

771
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,905
听着，臭婊子
Listen, you bitch,

772
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:40,118
如果我需要，我会把你留在这个几个星期
I'll keep you in this state
for weeks, if I have to.

773
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:41,828
现在，你和我说话
Now, you talk to me.

774
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:44,539
卡尔森，和我在一起
Carlsen, be with me.

775
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,958
- 你想从我这里要什么？
- 我爱你
What do you want from me?
I love you.

776
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,049
你是什么？
<i>What are you?</i>

777
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,967
你为什么如此像人类，如此完美？
Why are you so human?
So perfect?

778
01:15:58,928 --> 01:16:00,805
什么飞船上的鸟人？
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

779
01:16:00,805 --> 01:16:03,600
我们的身体并不重要
Our bodies are unimportant.

780
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:07,479
当你们这些男人在飞船上靠近…
<i>As you and your men
have approached in your ship,</i>

781
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:09,105
我为你换了他们
<i>we changed them.</i>
For you.

782
01:16:11,107 --> 01:16:12,984
我们进入了你的脑海…
<i>We entered your minds</i>

783
01:16:12,984 --> 01:16:14,903
并发现了那些新身体
<i>and found there new bodies.</i>

784
01:16:15,987 --> 01:16:18,323
我替换了你们的思想
I took my shape
from your mind.

785
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:21,076
我使用了你们的语言
<i>I took your language.</i>

786
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,871
我变成了女人，直到在那里被发现…
I became the woman
I found there,

787
01:16:25,288 --> 01:16:27,165
在你思想最深处，你最需要的
in your deepest thoughts,
your deepest needs.

788
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,255
我是你想像中的女人，卡尔森
I am the feminine
in your mind, Carlsen.

789
01:16:36,841 --> 01:16:38,635
Where are you?

790
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,513
你在哪里？
Where are you!

791
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,390
你的身体在哪里？
Where's your body!

792
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,894
让我去找！让我去找！
Let me go!
Let me go!

793
01:16:48,311 --> 01:16:51,356
让我去找！让我去找！
Let me go!
Let me go!

794
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,319
- 卡尔森，摸我一下
- 你在哪？
Touch me, Carlsen.

795
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:57,862
Let me go.

796
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:00,615
Let me go.

797
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:03,243
Let me go!

798
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,037
Let me go!

799
01:17:08,164 --> 01:17:11,084
Let me go.
Let me go!

800
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,588
Let me go!

801
01:17:17,298 --> 01:17:18,633
Let me go.

802
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:23,304
Let me go.

803
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,710
- 已经正在传播
- 怎么啦？
- It's already spraadlng.
- How?

804
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,420
你无法阻止了，太晚了
You didn't stop it,
it's too late.

805
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:40,048
我们跟了她一半
That's impossible, we've been only
half a step behind her all the way.

806
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,299
这位先生已经停止呼吸
Sir, this gentleman's
stopped breathing.

807
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:44,552
也没有脉膊
There's no pulse either.

808
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:56,814
我想他的脖子断了
Sir, I think his neck is broken.

809
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,570
为珀西爵士准备一个担架，
为阿姆斯壮博士也准备一个
Lampson, prepare two stretchers.
One for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

810
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,908
为旅行准备好药物
Prepare all your remaining doses
of the drug for travel.

811
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,201
好的，长官
Yes, sir.

812
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,377
你说无法阻止，它仍在传播
You said the thing
hadn't stopped,
it was still spreading.

813
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:20,338
- 你为什么那样说？
- 不知道
Why did you say that?

814
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:22,465
她可能是故意引着我们离开伦敦？
I don't know.
Could the girl have been deliberately
leading us away from London?

815
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:27,971
我们找得到全部受害者吗？
Is it possible we didn't find
all of her victims?

816
01:19:29,138 --> 01:19:30,473
除公园那个，如果有其他的…
If we didn't find all
the victims,
if there are others
besides the girl in the park.

817
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:34,227
- 那就会传播
- 产生连锁反应…
The thing would spread.

818
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:37,730
几何学上，到如今为止…
And a chain reaction,
geometrically, until by now...

819
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:40,650
天哪
Oh, Christ.

820
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:18,271
中尉，可以用无线电呼叫伦敦的S.R.C.吗？
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to get through to the S.R.C. in London?

821
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:19,939
稍等片刻，长官，可以呼叫的
Just a moment, sir,
there's something coming through.

822
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,818
是S.R.C. ，给你和卡尔森的
It is the S.R.C., sir,
for you and Carlsen.

823
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:31,743
<i>Caine, can you hear me?</i>

824
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:34,912
法拉达，大声点！我听不到！
Fallada, speak up,
I can't hear you.

825
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:38,041
那两个男的没死
<i>The two males didn't die.</i>

826
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,794
他们进入了士兵身体…
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soldiers who shot them

827
01:20:41,794 --> 01:20:45,089
而且把两个士兵的身体变成了自己的
and transformed the soldiers bodies
into their own likenesses.

828
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:47,467
与他们和他们的受害者不同的是
That's the difference between them
and their victims.

829
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:49,218
受害人的灵魂不能离开他们的身体，
只有最初的三个能够做到
<i>The victims can't leave
their bodies.</i>
<i>Only the original three
can do that.</i>

830
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:52,972
- 我已杀了他们其中的一个
- 什么其中一个？
But I've killed one of them.

831
01:20:53,931 --> 01:20:57,185
两个男吸血鬼中的一个
- One of which?
- One of the two male vampires.

832
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,729
- 正在变换的一个
- 怎么杀死的？
One of the transformed ones.
How did you kill him,
Fallada, how?

833
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:03,941
卡尔森，老办法
The old way, Carlsen.

834
01:21:03,941 --> 01:21:08,279
一根含铅的金属棍，不是刺穿心脏…
A leaded metal shaft,
penetrating not through the heart,

835
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:12,200
而是在心脏下面两英寸，穿过他们的能量中心
but through the energy center
two inches below the heart.

836
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,370
不是钢，是铅铁混合物
Not steel, but leaded iron.

837
01:21:15,828 --> 01:21:17,413
卡尔森，能行吗？
<i>Right, Carlsen?</i>

838
01:21:18,414 --> 01:21:20,166
- 你还在那里吗？
- 是的
<i>Are you there, Carlsen?</i>

839
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,043
卡尔森，你和肯…
Yes.
<i>Carlsen, you too, Caine,</i>

840
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:28,841
我的信仰…
传说中的吸血鬼就像是这些人形生物
it is my belief
that the vampires of legend
came from creatures
such as these.

841
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:35,056
也许就是这些人型生物
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

842
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,642
我知道有点让人难以置信
I know it sounds incredible.

843
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,187
你在听我说话吗？
Do you hear me, Carlsen!

844
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:45,650
比信仰更多是事实
It's morn than a ballot, Fallada...
It's true.

845
01:21:46,859 --> 01:21:48,528
他们以前造访过地球
They visited Earth before.

846
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,115
- 另一个男的怎么样了？
- 还没找到
What about
the other male, Fallada?

847
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:53,908
He's free.

848
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:56,369
- 你有那个女孩？
- 是的
<i>You have the girl?</i>

849
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:57,578
- 我们很快就会到那里，稍等
- 我会等的
<i>Yes.</i>

850
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:01,249
We'll be with you
as soon as we can, hold on.
<i>We'll try.</i>

851
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,337
- 当你说话的时候，这个来了
- 是什么？
This came through
while you were talking, sir.

852
01:22:06,337 --> 01:22:08,548
总理发给珀西爵士的密电
- What is it?
- A scrambled cryptogram.
It's to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

853
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,428
我们将直接到白宫的根据地
We're to proceed directly
to the Citadel at Whitehall.

854
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,722
<i>Came--</i>

855
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:57,013
中尉，控制住！
Lieutenant, the controls!

856
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:13,112
我们已失去她了，她走了！
<i>We've lost her. she's gone.</i>

857
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:15,573
- 到哪里去了？
- 她的身体在伦敦
Where?
Her body's in London.

858
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,659
伦敦的哪里？
Where in London?

859
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:25,750
what really happened
on the Churchill.

860
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:31,047
不是罗林斯毁坏了无线电设备…
It wasn't Rawlings who destroyed
the radio equipment.

861
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:32,798
和飞船的磁带
And the ship's tapes.

862
01:23:33,799 --> 01:23:35,051
- 是我
- 为什么？
It was me.

863
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:36,052
我不想邱吉尔号回到地球
Why?
I didn't want the Churchill
to be able to reach Earth.

864
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:42,391
如果回来了，我不想要任何人知道发生了什么
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

865
01:23:42,391 --> 01:23:43,726
发生什么？
What did happen?

866
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:47,355
我打开了密封好的盒子
I opened her sealed
animation case.

867
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:52,109
不知道是我还是她打开的
Either I did it or she did it.

868
01:23:53,819 --> 01:23:55,613
我无法控制自己
I couldn't help myself.

869
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:58,658
我从没有如此经历
I've never experienced such--

870
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:03,538
我坠入了爱河，你不知道的，肯
I was in love on a level
you've never known, Caine.

871
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:11,003
那使我害怕
<i>It terrifies me.</i>

872
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:14,382
我的命运和我开了玩笑
<i>My memory plays tricks on me.</i>

873
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:19,971
她在呼唤我
<i>She was calling me.</i>

874
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:25,017
她的力量是精神上的
<i>Her power was...spiritual.</i>

875
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,633
肯，她想要我
<i>She wanted me, Caine.</i>

876
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,765
比精神力更强
<i>It was more than spiritual.</i>

877
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:19,572
她拿走了我的一些生命能量
<i>She took some of my energy.</i>

878
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,847
并给了我一些她的能量
<i>And she gave me
some of her energy.</i>

879
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,880
当我们发现他们之前，
他们应该是彼此倚赖着生活
<i>They must have been living off
of each other when we found them.</i>

880
01:25:37,089 --> 01:25:39,050
他们只有三个留了下来
<i>There were only three
of them left.</i>

881
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:43,137
她杀了我们的人，一个接一个
<i>She killed all of my men.</i>

882
01:25:44,513 --> 01:25:46,015
<i>One by one.</i>

883
01:25:47,516 --> 01:25:49,101
只有我幸存
<i>But I survived.</i>

884
01:25:50,227 --> 01:25:51,937
她想要我留下来，她选择了我！
<i>She wanted me to survive.</i>

885
01:25:53,147 --> 01:25:54,565
<i>She chose me!</i>

886
01:25:55,816 --> 01:25:58,319
为什么？为什么？
<i>Why, why!</i>

887
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:01,697
她不是人类，她不是一个女人
Carlsen, she's not human,
she's not a woman.

888
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:03,366
她会毁掉你
She'll destroy you.

889
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:07,453
她会毁掉整个世界
She's destroyed worlds.

890
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:09,789
有些事你应该想听，长官
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

891
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:12,124
英国广播公司的特别报道
A special bulletin
from the BBC.

892
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:14,877
今晚，伦敦在毁灭的边缘…
<i>It's obvious that tonight,</i>

893
01:26:14,877 --> 01:26:18,214
自从闪击战以来，最严重的灾难
<i>London is on the brink of the worst
devastation since the blitz.</i>

894
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:19,507
城市的大片区域在燃烧，完全不受控制
<i>From where I'm standing,</i>
<i>I can see large areas of the city
burning out of control.</i>

895
01:26:23,594 --> 01:26:26,889
成千上万的人正慌乱地经过街道
在混乱中，尽可能地逃难
<i>And thousands of people are now
rampaging through the streets here</i>
<i>in a frenzied last effort
to avoid the plague.</i>

896
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:32,937
已经实施戒严三个多小时
<i>Martial law has been enforced now
for three hours</i>

897
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:35,439
但显然无法阻止
<i>But for the moment,
it hasn't stemmed what is obviously...</i>

898
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,203
- 我们一直在等你
- 谢谢，继续坚持
Yes, sir, we've been
expecting you.

899
01:27:31,203 --> 01:27:32,580
- 快点过去，警官
- 好的，长官
Thank you, carry on.
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- <i>Right, sir.</i>

900
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,250
- 到那一边去
- 好的
- Hilggins, around the other side.
- nght.

901
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:47,845
已准备疏散内阁吗？
<i>ls everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?</i>

902
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:48,971
- 准备好了
- 请坐，先生
<i>Yes, everything.</i>
<i>Please take e seat. gentlemen.</i>

903
01:27:54,935 --> 01:27:59,732
长官，肯上校及卡尔森上校在等你
Sir, I have Colonel Caine
and Colonel Carlsen here for you, sir.

904
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:01,609
很好
Very good.

905
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:04,403
总理不久就会接见你
等的时候要喝杯茶吗？
The Prime Minister
will see you shortly.
Uh, would you care for a cup of tea,
while you wait?

906
01:28:05,946 --> 01:28:08,407
- 不要了，事情很紧急
- 总理已经知道
No, our business is
rather urgent.
Yes, I'm sure the Prime Minister
understands that.

907
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:12,953
- 先生
- 总理
- Oh, uh, gentlemen?
- Prime Minister.

908
01:28:12,953 --> 01:28:14,705
我是空军勤务处肯上校…
I'm Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service,

909
01:28:14,705 --> 01:28:17,708
我相信你已经听到过邱吉尔号的卡尔森上校
and I'm sure you've heard of
Colonel Carlsen, late of the Churchill.

910
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:23,631
顺便问一下，珀西爵士在哪里？
By the way, uh,
where is Sir Percy?

911
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:25,257
恐怕已经去世了
Dead, I'm afraid.

912
01:28:25,257 --> 01:28:27,343
哦，那非常遗憾
Oh, that's a great pity.

913
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:31,430
长官，我们有关于天空中那个物体的消息
<i>Sir, we have information regarding
the object in space,</i>

914
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:33,015
- 是那个正在冲向地球的…
- 是的，先生
<i>which is bearing down on the Earth
at this moment--</i>
Ye-ye-yes, gentlemen, look, if you'll
excuse me just-- just for a moment.

915
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,649
抱歉，请等一会

916
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:39,688
哈弗沙姆小姐，到这里来
Mi-- Miss Haversham,
please come this way.

917
01:28:39,688 --> 01:28:42,775
好的，等一会
Miss Haversham, here,
for a moment.

918
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:44,652
我马上回来，先生
I'll be back, gentlemen,
I'll be back.

919
01:28:53,452 --> 01:28:55,120
<i>Miss Haversham,</i>

920
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,834
Miss Haversham,
come this way.

921
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,044
请
<i>Miss Haversham, please.</i>

922
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:11,971
马上叫医生来
Mind his head.
<i>Go and get
the doctor immediately.</i>

923
01:29:15,057 --> 01:29:16,600
Hey, what's happening
down there?

924
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,437
我们这里需要一个医生
<i>Need a doctor over here.</i>

925
01:29:34,618 --> 01:29:36,328
走！
Go, go!

926
01:30:03,856 --> 01:30:06,025
- 飞机上有武器吗？
- 没有，长官！
Lieutenant, do you have
any weapons aboard the craft?

927
01:30:06,025 --> 01:30:08,777
- 有一把闪光手枪
- 在哪里？
No, sir, uh,
there's a flare pistol, sir.

928
01:30:08,777 --> 01:30:09,820
缺口旁边，已经上膛了
Where is it?
Just close the breach
and it's ready to fire.

929
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:12,564
抓住他！

930
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:22,666
当你和总理在一起时，
我接到空军基地的电话
Sir, while you were with the PM,
I had a call from base operations.

931
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:24,460
城市已经戒严，我们由北约指挥
The city is now
under martial law.
We've been placed
under NATO command.

932
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,799
在S.R.C. 着陆，我们必须和法拉达谈谈
My unit's been mobilized
across the river
to a staging area
at Blackheath.
Land at the S.R.C., Lieutenant,
we've got to talk to Fallada.

933
01:30:33,469 --> 01:30:35,262
我们在布莱克希思着陆，空军已封锁整个城市
<i>I've been ordered to land
at Blackheath, sir.</i>
<i>The city's now
under air quarantine.</i>

934
01:30:37,556 --> 01:30:39,642
如果不按命行事，我们会被他们击落
<i>If we don't do as they say,
they'll shoot us out of the air.</i>

935
01:30:45,814 --> 01:30:49,276
零号，我是X射线318号，
请求清除障碍，请求着陆，完毕
Hello, zero, this is x-ray 3-1-8
requesting clearance to land-- over.

936
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:52,237
我是零号，知道了，
X射线318号，你们可以着陆
<i>Zero roger, x-ray 3-1-8,
you are clear to land.</i>

937
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:04,124
离开飞机！你们在封锁区！
Come away from the aircraft.

938
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:05,542
You are under quarantine.

939
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:08,671
到这里来，长官
Over here, please, sir.

940
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:12,633
不要过来！站在那里！
Don't come any closer,
stop there!

941
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,885
我想和你们的指挥官谈谈
I want to talk
to your commanding officer.

942
01:31:14,885 --> 01:31:17,304
我是空军勤务处肯上校…
I am Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service.

943
01:31:17,304 --> 01:31:20,099
他是汤姆·卡尔森上校
And this man
is Colonel Tom Carlsen,

944
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:23,394
美国空军邱吉尔号前指挥官
United States Air Force and former
commander of the Churchill.

945
01:31:24,019 --> 01:31:26,146
<i>c company, be on stand-by.</i>

946
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:30,567
S.R.C.的汉斯·法拉达博士在这里吗？
Is Dr. Hans Fallada here
from the S.R.C.?

947
01:31:30,567 --> 01:31:32,444
- 他知道我们是谁
- 不，我不知道
He knows who we are
and what's going on.
No, not that I know of.

948
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,740
- 有人听说过他吗？
- 没有
- Has anybody heard of him?
- No.

949
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,117
他一定还在伦敦
Must still be in London.

950
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:41,578
上校，你一定知道那里发生什么事了？
Colonel, what exactly do you know
about what's happening over there?

951
01:31:41,578 --> 01:31:43,288
我们确实知道，
那里发生了一场横扫伦敦的灾难
All we know
for certain, Colonel,
is that a terrible plague
of some sort is sweeping London.

952
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:49,503
潜伏期好像是二小时
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

953
01:31:49,503 --> 01:31:51,672
到那时为止，我不能让你们通行
<i>And until that time
has elapsed,</i>
I cannot release you
from this compound.

954
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:55,968
我们知道瘟疫是什么，我们没有感染
Colonel, we know
what the plague is.

955
01:31:55,968 --> 01:31:57,386
我知道我们在讨论什么！简直在浪费时间！
We are not infected.
I know what I'm talking about
and we're wasting valuable time.

956
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:06,478
我们已经完全把伦敦隔离
为了阻止进一步的传染
We have totally isolated London
in order to stop further contagion.

957
01:32:06,478 --> 01:32:10,190
如果失败了，将会威胁到周围的地区
If that fails and the surrounding
areas are threatened,

958
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:11,150
是的
Yes?

959
01:32:12,234 --> 01:32:16,363
已获准使用核武器
Sterilization by thermonuclear device
has been approved.

960
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:19,950
我们有布鲁塞尔·埃姆斯上将的授权
<i>We have this
from General Ames in Brussels.</i>

961
01:32:21,076 --> 01:32:23,829
他将在三小时内做出决定
He's coming up
with that decision in...
Just under three hours.

962
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:27,791
你知道与飞船有关的事吗？
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

963
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:29,251
- 太空飞船？
- 从哈雷慧星来的？
<i>Corporal Adams...</i>
- The ship?
- The thing from Halley's Comet.

964
01:32:31,503 --> 01:32:34,214
Oh...

965
01:32:34,214 --> 01:32:37,009
它停在伦敦上空的地球轨道上
It's parked itself
in a geostationary orbit...
Directly over London.

966
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:54,443
<i>Would air adjutant report
to Major Grover in GHQ.</i>

967
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:59,406
那些穿过云层的蓝色光茫像是人类的灵魂
All those little blue lights going up
toward the clouds,

968
01:33:00,699 --> 01:33:02,576
<i>they're human souls.</i>

969
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,621
- 你怎么知道的？
- 我感觉得到
How do you know that?
I feel it.

970
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:10,667
他们可以将别人释放的生命能量
收集后转变为自己的
<i>The process of conversion
releases a life energy.</i>

971
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:11,919
“收集”？
<i>Then it can be collected.</i>
Collected?

972
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,423
那个伞状的家伙是个搜藏家？
Is that what the umbrella is?

973
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:18,634
能源不由自主地就到那里去了
Collector?

974
01:33:18,967 --> 01:33:21,136
<i>The energy doesn't go free.</i>

975
01:33:21,136 --> 01:33:22,638
<i>It goes up there.</i>

976
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:46,411
那个男吸血鬼正在收集生命能量
<i>The male vampire's
collecting life energy.</i>

977
01:33:47,663 --> 01:33:51,291
但必须通过那女的送到伞状物那里
But he has to send it through her
to get it up to the collector.

978
01:33:53,043 --> 01:33:54,753
她在哪里？
Where is she, Carlsen?

979
01:33:57,631 --> 01:33:59,550
就在那边
Over there.

980
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,510
她的身体在发光
<i>I get flashes coming
from her body.</i>

981
01:34:02,636 --> 01:34:04,388
她在收集能量时能够感知环境
<i>Sensitive to its environment.</i>

982
01:34:05,305 --> 01:34:06,807
<i>Picks up things.</i>

983
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,517
- 你可以找到她吗？
- 如果我能够穿过这座城市
<i>I” can get across to the city.</i>
<i>Can you find her?</i>

984
01:34:13,021 --> 01:34:15,774
<i>He'll come
if he senses I've found her.</i>

985
01:34:15,774 --> 01:34:17,609
- 她在拉我
- 卡尔森！
<i>She's drawing me, Caine.</i>
<i>Caflsen.</i>

986
01:34:19,027 --> 01:34:20,070
我必须到那里去
<i>I've gotta go.</i>

987
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:24,032
为什么？
Why?

988
01:34:24,032 --> 01:34:26,285
她想把给我的能量拿回去
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

989
01:34:29,913 --> 01:34:31,790
当他们具有新的生命形式时…
When they take on
a new life form

990
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,210
他们必须从那种生命形式学习
they have to learn
from that life form.

991
01:34:36,128 --> 01:34:38,046
在某种意义上说，是适应新的生命形式
Mate with it, in a sense.

992
01:34:40,507 --> 01:34:42,259
那女孩选择了我
The girl chose me.

993
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:48,098
当她与我结合时，她把她的一部分给了我
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herself.

994
01:34:50,642 --> 01:34:52,895
现在她想把那部分拿回去
And now she wants
that part back.

995
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:56,523
在你那个地区有什么活动的迹象吗？完毕
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector?

996
01:34:56,523 --> 01:34:58,400
- 没有，长官
- 好，保持联系，完毕
- Over.
- No, sir.
Okay, keep me posted-- over.

997
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:02,070
上校，听我说，
卡尔森上校说他能找到那个女的的位置
Colonel, listen to me.
Carlsen believes
he can locate the source.

998
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:09,745
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

999
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:11,747
但我们只有一个半小时了
But we only have
an hour and a half.

1000
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,540
<i>What was that?</i>

1001
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:15,292
停火！
Cease firing!

1002
01:35:16,418 --> 01:35:18,587
卡尔森！
Caflson?

1003
01:35:19,838 --> 01:35:22,424
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored Land Rover.

1004
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,137
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was?

1005
01:35:27,137 --> 01:35:29,514
罗杰告诉了他，然后我就倒在了地上
Rogers told him, the next thing I knew,
I was on the ground, sir.

1006
01:35:29,514 --> 01:35:30,766
- 好，这是谁的汽车？
- 那辆？
Right, whose is this car?

1007
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:33,477
- 那是上校的
- 给我钥匙
- That, that's the Colonel's, sir.
- Give me the keys.

1008
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:34,811
- 什么？
- 我要征用这辆车！
- What?
- You heard me.
Give me the bloody keys,
I'm commandeering the car!

1009
01:35:37,272 --> 01:35:38,232
把钥匙给他
Give it to him.

1010
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:41,860
还有你手上的家伙
And your side arm.

1011
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:46,949
你真的知道你在做什么？
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1012
01:35:48,825 --> 01:35:51,411
如果你进去了，我不会允许你出来
You realize once you're inside there,
we can't allow you out.

1013
01:35:53,747 --> 01:35:55,040
- 小心！
- 他过来了！
<i>Where is he going?</i>

1014
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:03,882
肯上校，S.A.S.，我们要过河
Colonel Caine, S.A.S.,
I'm crossing the river.

1015
01:36:03,882 --> 01:36:05,133
- 你不要到那里去
- 我知道不可以的
You don't want to go
in there, sir.
I know I don't.

1016
01:36:08,136 --> 01:36:09,721
到大门的适当位置！保护这个部位！快！
Get them gates
in position!
Secure this post-- move!

1017
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:52,222
卡尔森，卡尔森
<i>Carlsen, Carlsen.</i>

1018
01:37:12,784 --> 01:37:14,953
卡尔森
<i>Caflsen.</i>

1019
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,249
卡尔森
<i>Caflsen.</i>

1020
01:37:19,249 --> 01:37:20,792
卡尔森
Carlsen.

Car/sen.
<i>Car/sen.</i>

1023
01:40:09,836 --> 01:40:11,171
- 法拉达
- 肯
FaHada?

1024
01:40:11,171 --> 01:40:12,714
很高兴见到你还没死
Caine.
<i>I'm glad to see you alive.</i>

1025
01:40:15,634 --> 01:40:17,969
我会报答你的
I reciprocate the sentiment.

1026
01:40:18,637 --> 01:40:20,263
- 这次他真的死了？
- 这是杀死他们的唯一办法
Is he really dead?

1027
01:40:20,263 --> 01:40:21,389
This time?

1028
01:40:21,389 --> 01:40:23,433
<i>The only way
they can be killed.</i>

1029
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,360
- 柯斯基在哪里？
- 死了
Where's Bukovsky?
<i>Dead.</i>

1030
01:40:35,654 --> 01:40:37,531
- 怎么死的？
- 像其他人
How?
Like the rest.

1031
01:40:41,117 --> 01:40:42,410
你怎么没死？
How did you survive?

1032
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:48,959
- 你正找卡尔森上校吗？
- 他在这里吗？
You're looking for Carlsen.

1033
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,670
多半是编号误导了你
Has he been here?
No, perhaps he misled you.

1034
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:55,840
- 关于他们（吸血鬼），你知道多少？
- 我已经做了很多工作
What do you know about it?
I've been doing some more work.

1035
01:40:58,051 --> 01:40:59,302
- 继续
- 我已经发现…
Go on.
I discovered

1036
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:04,975
死后的灵魂
there is life after death.

1037
01:41:04,975 --> 01:41:05,976
- 你怎么知道的？
- 有某种办法可以进行精神转换
How do you know?

1038
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:14,443
在吸血鬼和受害人之间发生了心灵感应
There is a certain
mental transference, telepathy,
that occurs between the vampires
and their victims.

1039
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:18,738
- 卡尔森上校是那女孩之后的
- 你是如何知道那些的？
Carlsen is after the girl.

1040
01:41:20,156 --> 01:41:21,449
How did you know that?

1041
01:41:21,449 --> 01:41:23,159
Oh, I...

1042
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:26,037
- 我似乎感觉到她
- 她在哪里，法拉达？
I seem to sense it.

1043
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:28,915
Where is she, Fallada?

1044
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:32,586
你不知道吗？
Don't you know?

1045
01:41:35,797 --> 01:41:37,591
- 卡尔森上校知道
- 在哪里，法拉达？
<i>Carlsen knows.</i>
Where, Fallada?

1046
01:41:39,718 --> 01:41:41,469
她在教堂里
She's in the cathedral.

1047
01:41:42,554 --> 01:41:44,598
她逃脱后就一直在那里
She's been there
since she escaped.

1048
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,851
与她接触的感觉相当好，你不想吗？
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

1049
01:41:48,518 --> 01:41:51,688
国王和皇后的地窖
The crypt of kings
and queens.

1050
01:41:51,688 --> 01:41:52,772
站在那里
Stay where you are.

1051
01:41:55,525 --> 01:41:56,735
站在那里
Stay where you are!

1052
01:42:13,501 --> 01:42:15,128
我到那里去
Here I go.

1053
01:43:32,497 --> 01:43:34,541
我知道你会来，卡尔森
I know you would come,
Carlson.

1054
01:44:20,962 --> 01:44:23,381
Now can this madness end?

1055
01:44:24,257 --> 01:44:25,884
过来
Come.

1056
01:44:26,968 --> 01:44:28,094
与我在一起
Be with me.

1057
01:44:29,345 --> 01:44:31,681
我需要你
<i>I need you.</i>

1058
01:44:31,681 --> 01:44:34,017
我一直计划
It was always intended

1059
01:44:34,017 --> 01:44:38,062
你们应该可以找到我们…
并带我们到地球
you should find us
and bring us to Earth.

1060
01:44:45,403 --> 01:44:49,157
命运之网带着你的灵和肉…
The web of destiny carries
your blood and soul

1061
01:44:49,365 --> 01:44:52,869
回到我的生命本源
back to the genesis
of my life form.

1062
01:44:53,578 --> 01:44:54,913
过来，你和我…
Come.

1063
01:44:56,122 --> 01:44:57,707
Be with me.

1064
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:00,835
跟我来，卡尔森
Come with me, Carlsen.

1065
01:48:13,152 --> 01:48:16,572
如果你到我这里来，就会不再害怕…
It'll be much less terrifying
if you just come to me.

1066
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,705
我只想这样做
I'll do just that.

1067
01:49:46,621 --> 01:49:48,873
<i>Cansen!</i>

1068
01:49:51,584 --> 01:49:53,461
你感觉到吗？
What are these feelings?

1069
01:49:53,461 --> 01:49:56,005
为什么我觉得如此亲近你，如此需要你？
Why do I feel so close to you?

1070
01:49:56,005 --> 01:49:57,381
因为你是我们中的一个，你一直都是
Need you?
Because you're one of us.

1071
01:50:00,301 --> 01:50:01,427
You always have been.

1072
01:50:01,844 --> 01:50:03,179
你喜欢我，喜欢和我在一起
You're like me.
Be with me.

1073
01:50:16,317 --> 01:50:19,487
只有这些？只有这些？
Just a little more.
Just a little more.

1074
01:50:23,991 --> 01:50:26,369
卡尔森！
<i>Cansen!</i>

1075
01:50:28,329 --> 01:50:30,957
卡尔森！
<i>Cansen!</i>

1076
01:50:38,673 --> 01:50:40,633
卡尔森！
Carlsen!

1077
01:50:46,514 --> 01:50:47,890
卡尔森！
Carlsen!

1078
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:03,281
肯！
Caine!
