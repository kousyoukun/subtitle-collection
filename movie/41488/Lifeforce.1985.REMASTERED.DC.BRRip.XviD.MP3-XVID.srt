1
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,146
<i>August 9th, 2:30 PM,
Greenwich Mean Time.</i>

2
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,523
<i>The HMS Churchill outward bound.</i>

3
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:50,276
<i>On board a joint British/American
space team.</i>

4
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,445
<i>Their mission:
to intercept and study</i>

5
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,822
<i>the comet bearing
Dr. Edmond Halley's name.</i>

6
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:58,701
<i>The Churchill is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.</i>

7
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,662
<i>It propels the Churchill
with constant acceleration,</i>

8
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:04,457
<i>enough to create Earth-type gravity
for the first time</i>

9
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,375
<i>on an extended flight.</i>

10
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,837
<i>The Churchill is on course
for its rendezvous.</i>

11
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:11,756
Sir, this is odd.

12
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,798
What?

13
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:15,134
I'm getting a very small
radar cross section,

14
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,511
just ahead of the nucleus
in the coma of the comet.

15
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,013
I've got it too.

16
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,016
Check the length, Brendan,
it's at the limit of my angle of scan.

17
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,976
- What's going on?
- Did you chaps run an equipment check?

18
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,686
<i>I've been checking
every five minutes, sir.</i>

19
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:27,730
Radar state's 150 miles.

20
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,857
- 150 miles what?
- Length.

21
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:31,567
Hundred and fifty miles long?

22
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,695
What's 150 miles long?

23
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:37,114
It's a radar trace.

24
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,991
Something right ahead
in the coma of the comet.

25
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,034
Show me.

26
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,495
<i>EGR's confirmed.</i>

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,537
<i>Looks good.</i>

28
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:46,624
<i>EGR's optimal,
track three on three.</i>

29
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,958
<i>Roget.</i>

30
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,921
What's the height of the thing?

31
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,799
I've got a vertical reading
of two miles, at least.

32
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,634
<i>Ambient temperature six degrees.</i>

33
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,512
<i>Iron less than 2%,
traces of manganese, titanium--</i>

34
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,846
Try and raise base.

35
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:04,141
Tell them we have an artificial object
out here hidden in the--

36
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:05,601
Are you sure you want
to say hidden?

37
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:07,728
Tell them it's located
in the head of the comet.

38
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:10,481
Keep sending that
until they acknowledge.

39
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,233
Use a secured downlink.

40
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,361
Sorry, Commander, everything's
being swamped by the coma winds.

41
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,571
We can't get anything
back to base.

42
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:19,699
How long's the blackout period?

43
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,659
All the way.

44
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,547
What are you gonna do?

45
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,216
We're going in.

46
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,887
We're only gonna get
one chance, Derebridge.

47
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,892
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years.

48
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,811
And we'll both be dead.

49
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,772
We have to take a look now.

50
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,826
Shut down Nerva.

51
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,869
Shutting down.

52
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,704
Down one.

53
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:13,002
<i>Deltas plus one In two seconds.</i>

54
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,050
- Solar panels retracted.
<i>- Check.</i>

55
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,761
<i>Give me a readout, Bob.</i>

56
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:16,482
Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

57
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,651
Was it exploring the comet,
do you think?

58
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,948
Surface looks badly pitted.

59
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,950
In that case,
it's been here a long time.

60
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,119
It's derelict, whatever it is.

61
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,083
<i>Roger, Carlsen, we copy.</i>

62
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,334
<i>We have you going in.</i>

63
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:43,759
Churchill, looks like
some sort of giant artery-- organic.

64
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,178
I almost have the feeling
I've been here before.

65
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,685
Oh, boy.

66
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,989
I hope you can appreciate
the scale of this on the video.

67
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,282
<i>Roger, we're getting it.</i>

68
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,825
<i>It's all on tape.</i>

69
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,038
Oh, shit.

70
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,041
Well, here they are.

71
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:29,305
Churchill, it looks like we found
the occupants of the ship.

72
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,810
They look like bats...giant bats.

73
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:48,198
<i>Churchill, there must be
hundreds of them.</i>

74
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:51,118
<i>Thousands...dead. I hope.</i>

75
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,688
It's completely desiccated.

76
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,446
- <i>Crumbled.</i>
- Yes.

77
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,198
It would.

78
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,493
All the fluid's been lost to space
over the years.

79
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,463
We'll bag this one,
take it with us.

80
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,716
<i>We're deploying
the specimen bag.</i>

81
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:09,488
<i>Jesus,
what the hell is that?</i>

82
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:14,076
Commander,
the ship has just deployed a--

83
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,286
<i>it looks like some sort
of big structure</i>

84
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:19,331
<i>that's just unfolding--
it's enormous!</i>

85
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,086
God, what is it?

86
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,594
Better get out of here, sir.

87
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,513
Nobody's goin' anywhere,
stay where you are.

88
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:38,225
Churchill, this is Carlsen.

89
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:39,393
What's happening out there?

90
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,978
<i>The thing stopped opening.</i>

91
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:45,357
<i>The only way to describe it is--
it's-- it's like a giant umbrella.</i>

92
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,569
Good <i>god, it's--
it's absolutely enormous.</i>

93
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,946
Churchill, what's it doing now?

94
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,657
<i>Nothing, sir.</i>

95
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,163
<i>It stopped opening.</i>

96
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,582
<i>It's just sitting there.</i>

97
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,250
Tell what it's made of?

98
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,044
<i>Not metal.</i>

99
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,337
<i>It's radar transparent.</i>

100
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:13,927
Okay...if it starts up again,
let me know.

101
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:16,138
Any activity out there,
you understand?

102
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,598
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

103
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,149
That's where we're goin'.

104
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,294
Something there.

105
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,630
<i>Commander,
this is Churchill.</i>

106
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,965
<i>We're losing our signal.</i>

107
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,508
<i>We've lost VTR.</i>

108
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,135
<i>Come in, Commander.</i>

109
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:57,823
Bodies, three bodies.

110
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,741
Perfectly preserved.

111
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:05,747
They look to me to be like in--

112
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:08,041
Something's happening to me.

113
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,377
<i>What's wrong...</i>

114
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:14,131
<i>with me, wha--
what's wrong?</i>

115
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,187
<i>Commander, come in.</i>

116
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,605
<i>This is Churchill.</i>

117
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,148
<i>Do you copy?</i>

118
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,697
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sleep.

119
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,365
<i>Hold on, we're coming down.</i>

120
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:06,600
Churchill,
Churchill, if you read,

121
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,978
there are two nude males
and one female.

122
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:13,065
<i>This is Churchill,
we have no picture.</i>

123
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,441
Come <i>in, Tom.</i>

124
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:19,863
Churchill...l said we found
a young girl.

125
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:22,991
<i>Girl?
You mean human?</i>

126
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,202
Definitely humanoid.

127
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,828
<i>I'd say she's perfect.</i>

128
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,997
I've been in space for six months

129
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,083
and she looks perfect to me.

130
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,298
<i>Derebrldge, what's wrong?</i>

131
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:39,758
What's wrong...

132
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,064
How many
do you want to take back?

133
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,400
I say we take back all three.

134
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,362
One of the dead things
in the other chamber.

135
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,531
Well...

136
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,116
let's so.
If we can break 'om fr“.

137
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,514
<i>Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.</i>

138
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,599
<i>Do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.</i>

139
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,394
If they're going to pick us up,
they should get us this close.

140
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,646
<i>Simply aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.</i>

141
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:38,525
Automatic circuits
don't even respond.

142
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,652
They're radio dead.

143
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,446
Christ.

144
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,531
I hope it's just
their communications.

145
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:46,366
<i>...do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.</i>

146
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,828
<i>Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.</i>

147
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,957
<i>Churchill, come in,
this is Mission Control Great Britain.</i>

148
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,293
<i>Do you copy?
Come in, Churchill.</i>

149
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,377
How's their orbit look?

150
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:01,882
You can see it's stable,
but they're slightly off.

151
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,676
They should have adjusted coming in,
but they haven't.

152
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,470
<i>What do you make of that?</i>

153
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,889
<i>It would appear
that they, uh, set their course</i>

154
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,599
<i>just after they left the comet.</i>

155
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,976
I'd say it hasn't been
updated since.

156
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,483
The Columbia?

157
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,818
The Columbia.

158
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,280
<i>Lift of, we have lift off.</i>

159
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,716
Control, this is Columbia.

160
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,968
Are we clear
to initiate docking procedure?

161
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,596
<i>Go ahead, Columbia,
you are looking good.</i>

162
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,681
Stand by for soft dock.

163
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,810
<i>Soft dock.</i>

164
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,147
Soft dock confirmed.

165
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,598
Columbia,
the ship's completely gutted.

166
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,224
Oh, my God.

167
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,643
Houston, we have a problem.

168
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,520
There's been a fire.

169
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,527
I'll take a look in the tug bay.

170
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:28,945
You two try the top deck.

171
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,891
<i>Columbia, they're all dead.</i>

172
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,769
Nothing down here, Columbia.

173
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,395
I'm going on in to the tug bay.

174
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,150
I'll get the tapes.

175
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:42,102
Somner, I think there's something
you ought to see in the tug bay.

176
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:01,580
I see-- how did you open
the girl's case?

177
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,124
We didn't, Minister.

178
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,042
We were just talking
about how to get it open

179
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,128
when it popped open
of its own accord.

180
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,046
Did you x-ray the crystal cases?

181
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,548
We're not certain they're crystal.

182
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,091
The casings are not metallic.

183
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,677
I'm not even sure they're organic.

184
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,763
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there,

185
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,599
if that makes any sense.

186
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,766
And the bodies from the cases?

187
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,686
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

188
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:28,773
Provided, of course,
that Dr. Fallada agrees they're dead.

189
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,652
FaHada.

190
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,073
I don't know that I'm qualified
to pass judgment on alien death.

191
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:38,950
You would agree
that they're less alive than we are?

192
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,039
<i>Yesterday
in Hong Kong, gold closed lower.</i>

193
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,043
<i>In light trading
on European currency markets,</i>

194
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,420
<i>the pound closed mixed
against the dollar</i>

195
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,796
<i>and West German mark</i>

196
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,925
<i>There will be a full market report
after the late news.</i>

197
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,054
<i>This is James Graham reporting
from the city.</i>

198
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,139
<i>Now back to the newsroom.</i>

199
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,896
<i>...developments as they arise.</i>

200
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,232
<i>Halley's Comet is now dominating
the northern skies,</i>

201
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:13,485
<i>stretching over a hundred million miles
across the heavens,</i>

202
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,613
<i>occupying one-sixth
of the entire visible horizon.</i>

203
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,074
<i>On this exceptionally clear night,</i>

204
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,117
<i>a group of enthusiasts are
commemorating</i>

205
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:24,454
<i>Dr. Edmond Halley's great prediction
by holding an outdoor watching</i>

206
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,748
<i>from the site of his original
observatory at Greenwich.</i>

207
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,668
<i>Our viewers may be interested
to know that comets</i>

208
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,337
<i>were once considered
to be harbingers of evil,</i>

209
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,423
<i>and that one of the earliest words
for comet was disaster,</i>

210
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,801
<i>which in Latin means evil star.</i>

211
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:41,971
<i>And it may indeed be an evil star
for the deep space probe, Churchill.</i>

212
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,265
<i>There's still no word
from Her Majesty's Government</i>

213
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:47,686
<i>as to the fate of the crew,
whether they're alive or dead.</i>

214
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,813
<i>We can only await
further developments.</i>

215
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,390
Use my body.

216
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,278
<i>Bukovsky.</i>

217
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,428
Bukovsky, where--
where's the girl!

218
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,930
She's gone.

219
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,517
<i>I saw her.</i>

220
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:03,149
She did that.

221
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,736
<i>Security.</i>

222
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,571
Hello, Professor Fallada here.

223
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,949
I'm calling at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

224
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,284
Get me the Duty Security Captain now.

225
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:14,744
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

226
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,748
Don't worry, a naked girl is not going
to get out of this complex.

227
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,496
Four nine to Control.

228
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,165
You'll never believe
what I'm looking at.

229
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,004
Control, can you say that again?

230
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,380
<i>I believe you heard me.</i>

231
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,215
<i>There's a girl on the loose
in the building.</i>

232
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:10,758
<i>She must not leave.</i>

233
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:13,594
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

234
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:15,388
<i>That's right, that's what I said.</i>

235
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,597
<i>Surely, you can find her.</i>

236
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:17,974
Must be some kinda joke.

237
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,565
I don't believe it.

238
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:30,278
All right, Miss,
just stay where you are.

239
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,280
You heard 'em,
they said grab her.

240
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,533
Take it easy, Link,
she's not in her right mind.

241
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,953
Control, Control, we have located
the girl in the main lobby.

242
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:42,290
That's it, come on.

243
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,167
Yes.

244
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,585
<i>We've located the girl, sir.</i>

245
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,087
- Whore?
<i>- She's downstairs In the main lobby.</i>

246
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:49,547
Right.

247
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:51,090
She's in the main lobby.

248
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,260
- You all right to go down there?
- No.

249
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,555
Come on, nice and easy.

250
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,223
Come on.

251
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,559
Come to me.

252
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,561
Come to daddy, come on.

253
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,656
Make it stop, make it stop!

254
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,785
<i>Come on, let's get her.</i>

255
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,583
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah.

256
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:34,986
<i>Will all non-involved
personnel please clear the area.</i>

257
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:40,408
<i>I repeat-- Will everybody who has no
business to be here,</i>

258
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:44,328
<i>please clear the area
for your own safety.</i>

259
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:46,747
<i>This is a police announcement.</i>

260
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:49,375
<i>Please keep right back--</i>

261
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,502
<i>- Sony. gonthmon. no photos phat.
- Hun</i>

262
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,090
Sorry.

263
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,092
May I ask which of you
is Dr. Bukovsky?

264
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,803
lam.

265
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:02,388
I'm Colonel Caine.

266
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:03,598
From the S.A.S.?

267
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,142
Gentlemen, that last remark
is not for publication.

268
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,602
This is a D Notice situation.

269
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,409
Not too close.

270
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:30,791
And this was murder...
you say?

271
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,257
Tell me again how the girl
overpowered you.

272
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:43,179
She, uh...

273
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,808
was the most overwhelmingly
effeminate presence

274
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:49,769
I've ever encountered.

275
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,146
I was drawn to her
on a level that--

276
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:53,564
Was it sexual?

277
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:56,234
Yes, overwhelmingly so.

278
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,403
And horrible.

279
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:01,614
Loss of control.

280
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,908
And the man, the guard, was dead
when you came into the room?

281
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,117
You found him as he is now?

282
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:07,119
Yeah.

283
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,705
And the girl, she came
from the ship, Churchill?

284
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,999
Uh-huh.

285
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,876
She spoke to you?

286
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,503
In English?

287
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,129
That's right.

288
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:18,798
How would she know English?

289
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:21,217
Now, going back--

290
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,844
you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire?

291
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:26,013
No, they weren't destroyed
in the fire.

292
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:27,932
That's what we were told
to tell the public.

293
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,016
They were erased.

294
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:30,059
Erased?

295
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,478
Also, the Churchill's escape pod
is missing.

296
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:34,063
What's that mean,
did someone escape?

297
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,231
They don't know.

298
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,692
Unfortunately,
the condition of the bodies

299
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,027
make an accurate count impossible.

300
00:29:40,027 --> 00:29:42,488
Could the heat from the fire
have launched the pod?

301
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,073
<i>No, no, no.</i>

302
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:47,743
What started the fire?

303
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,457
The ship's oxygen system ignited.

304
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:56,168
It was a terribly hot fire.

305
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:59,755
Yet, you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

306
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,842
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?

307
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,678
In the bay where the space tug
was stored.

308
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,263
Where everything else
was charred.

309
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,683
Incredible.

310
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,934
Is it not?

311
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,271
Have you examined the cases?

312
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,483
Using every technique we have.

313
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,528
X-ray scans of the cases
yield only blurred images.

314
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:23,654
What does that mean?

315
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:26,824
They're not precisely physical objects.

316
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,701
More like a sort of force field.

317
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,871
<i>We're a bit out of our depth here.</i>

318
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,247
<i>The whole thing is--</i>

319
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:34,665
Yes, I know.

320
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:36,083
Incredible.

321
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:39,170
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard?

322
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,130
No, I suppose not.

323
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,506
What about your two other bodies?

324
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,678
Colonel, may I be excused?

325
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:50,431
I seem to be feeling a little more
nauseous than I thought.

326
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,390
Yes, of course.

327
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:03,861
I notice from your door, Dr. Fallada,
that your area is biochemistry.

328
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,822
But I understand
your real interest is--

329
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:09,200
Death, Colonel Caine, correct.

330
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,369
Thanatology is the name for it.

331
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,497
Death for you, Colonel, is a
bureaucratic problem-- who did it?

332
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,582
When and why did they do it?

333
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,501
A problem to be solved,
am I correct?

334
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,877
And for you?

335
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:22,129
Well, I'm fascinated
by death itself--

336
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,839
What happens as we die,
when we die.

337
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,216
What happens after we die?

338
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,926
You mean, life after death.

339
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,177
<i>Yes.</i>

340
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,387
- Is there?
- What?

341
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,513
<i>Life after death.</i>

342
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,766
Do you really want to know?

343
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,476
No.

344
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:41,107
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

345
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:45,152
If I am correct,
the life force is conserved

346
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,488
always and in all things,
even after death.

347
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,324
And you think that applies
to what's happened here tonight?

348
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:52,368
Yes.

349
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,245
Yes, I do.

350
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,248
I think that girl, creature,

351
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,376
drained energy,
life force,

352
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:04,004
partially from Bukovsky
and totally from the guard.

353
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:05,965
A vampire?

354
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,884
It could be described that way, yes.

355
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:10,886
I mean, in a sense,
we're all vampires.

356
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:13,973
We drain energy
from other life forms.

357
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,350
The difference is one of degree.

358
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,645
That girl was no girl.

359
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:24,400
She's totally alien to this planet
and our life form.

360
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,485
And totally dangerous.

361
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,233
Jesus.

362
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:08,652
Do you believe those blokes are alive?

363
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:10,529
I'm not paid to believe nothing, am I?

364
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,826
I believe they're alive.

365
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,998
Don't look bloody dead to me.

366
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:17,429
We've had some trouble,
but everything's under control.

367
00:34:18,138 --> 00:34:19,848
<i>I think you better
come down here.</i>

368
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,601
<i>Yes, sir...very good, sir.</i>

369
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:40,536
It would appear these two
are no longer dangerous.

370
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,374
Well, there's certainly no possibility
of doing a full autopsy on them.

371
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,210
I would like to examine the guard.

372
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,254
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

373
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,380
I believe so, sir.

374
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,885
This is an autopsy on the body
of a young man,

375
00:34:56,885 --> 00:34:58,804
dead approximately two hours.

376
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:00,848
Did you say he was about 20?

377
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,141
Yes, that's correct.

378
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,127
Get the Colonel down here,
quickly!

379
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,223
God.

380
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,934
Put him in an isolation cell,
quickly!

381
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,060
Sergeant.

382
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,163
I had no idea
that it could be passed on.

383
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,081
What do you suggest?

384
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,710
I would recommend that you place
this body in another cell.

385
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,879
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

386
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:40,632
I won't be at all surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

387
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:42,426
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,511
Also, I want the two other bodies
that were shot-- the males.

389
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,305
Collect the pieces and watch them.

390
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,890
Get me the Home Secretary
on the line now.

391
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,433
Sir.

392
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,059
Call for the Colonel, sir.

393
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:52,519
Sir, you have a call.

394
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,729
Caine.

395
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,522
<i>Sir, we've found
a naked girl in Hyde park.</i>

396
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:57,566
<i>The body is
in an indescribable condition.</i>

397
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,984
I'll be right there.

398
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,195
They've just found a body
in Hyde Park.

399
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,362
A naked girl.

400
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:04,782
They say she's
in an indescribable condition.

401
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,992
Could that be your girl?

402
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,245
- Well?
- That's not her.

403
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,706
Inspector, what about the two boys?

404
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:14,583
Oh, yes, they were
in the park earlier, sir.

405
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,336
Yeah, we saw her.

406
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,629
I think.

407
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,963
Earlier.

408
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,633
Any rate,
that looks like her hair.

409
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,219
- What a mess.
- Was she alone?

410
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,262
No, that's why we notices her.

411
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:28,847
She was with a dark haired girl.

412
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:30,349
Real good looking bird and all.

413
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,309
Didn't have a lot of clothes on either.

414
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,353
We thought they might be--
well, you know.

415
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,646
Yes.

416
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,856
Well, did you see where they went,
where the dark haired girl went?

417
00:38:37,856 --> 00:38:39,942
No, no, we didn't.

418
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,319
We angled on back
to see if maybe we could--

419
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,613
you know,
see 'em doing something.

420
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:47,825
- That's when we found her.
- How long ago was that?

421
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,867
Half an hour ago.

422
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:50,994
Yeah, this lad phoned us
and then we phoned you, sir.

423
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:53,163
Yes, thank you, Inspector.

424
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,876
Obviously, the work of the girl.

425
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:01,922
You think we can have this body sent
back to the center with the others?

426
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,549
<i>Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.</i>

427
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:06,385
Inspector, let me know if you find
anything else, will you?

428
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,761
We'll be taking her back with us.

429
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:08,929
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

430
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,975
Now she has clothes.

431
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:17,271
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

432
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,993
Dr. Hans Fallada, Sir Percy Heseltine,
the Home Secretary.

433
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,453
You're just in time.

434
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,915
It's exactly two hours.

435
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,386
Please help me.

436
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:52,723
This is the guard who was originally
overcome by the space girl.

437
00:39:57,644 --> 00:39:59,062
Please.

438
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,525
Please.

439
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:31,386
As I feared,
once transformed,

440
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:34,431
the victims need
regular infusions of energy.

441
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:35,474
Otherwise--

442
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,767
Otherwise what?

443
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,458
Oh, my God.

444
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:05,420
Dear God.

445
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,926
And down here we have the pathologist
who was attacked by the guard.

446
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:23,105
- See.
- He too needs feeding.

447
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:42,165
The same thing is going to happen
to that girl we found in the park.

448
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,584
In about one hour.

449
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,844
She's the last?

450
00:43:17,844 --> 00:43:19,596
Have there been
any further reports, Kelly?

451
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:21,973
No, sir, we set up
to get the calls here

452
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:23,183
the instant one comes in.

453
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,102
- What?
- Nothing.

454
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,480
You say these creatures were brought
back from the Churchill?

455
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,898
Yes, sir, but not this one.

456
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,775
She's a victim of the creatures.

457
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,903
Yes, yes, but where did
the Churchill acquire them?

458
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,197
We have no way
of determining that at present.

459
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:39,491
<i>- Perhaps that's all changing.</i>
- What?

460
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,285
I've just received a call
from the JPL in Pasadena.

461
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:44,955
Seems the Goldstone tracking disc has
just picked up something

462
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,082
they think is Churchill's escape pod--

463
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,709
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

464
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:51,128
Where?

465
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,462
Texas.

466
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,431
Come on, guys, hurry It up.

467
00:44:18,613 --> 00:44:20,532
All right, take it easy now.

468
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,783
Hey, buddy, you all right?

469
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,497
Where?

470
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,416
Walter Reed Army Hospital?

471
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,209
Is he hurt?

472
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:32,627
Just exhausted, you say.

473
00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:34,171
Well, get him the hell over here!

474
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,885
Colonel Carlsen,
they're expecting you, sir.

475
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:43,638
Colonel Carlsen, sir.

476
00:44:45,098 --> 00:44:46,349
<i>Tom.</i>

477
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,314
I thought you were dead.

478
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:54,274
Bukovsky.

479
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,943
Colonel Carlsen,
allow me to introduce

480
00:44:56,943 --> 00:44:58,945
Colonel Caine
of the Special Air Services.

481
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:00,197
How do you do?

482
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,032
You already know Dr. Fallada.

483
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,116
Colonel.

484
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,702
Take a seat, won't you?

485
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,709
I'm sorry to drag you
over here like this, Tom.

486
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:15,295
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

487
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,009
Tom, we've got to know
what happened on the Churchill.

488
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,385
Yes, of course.

489
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:31,061
It may be, uh...very difficult for you
to accept what I'm going to say.

490
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,563
We'll have very little difficulty

491
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,315
believing anything
you have to tell us, Colonel.

492
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,733
Do go on.

493
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,568
You know something?

494
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:40,612
There was a fire
aboard the Churchill.

495
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,281
You might be interested to know

496
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:46,493
that the bodies of the three humanoids
were not destroyed in that fire.

497
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,328
<i>They survived in their</i> cases.

498
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,705
They were brought
down here to London,

499
00:45:50,705 --> 00:45:52,332
and the female has escaped.

500
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,084
<i>She's killed three people already.</i>

501
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,212
Oh, my God.

502
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:02,342
So you see, Colonel, whatever
you have to tell us is rather pressing.

503
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,469
Please tell us what happened.

504
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,891
We found the bodies
aboard the alien spacecraft.

505
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:12,060
What alien spacecraft?

506
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,564
Colonel, take it
from the beginning.

507
00:46:16,564 --> 00:46:18,400
Assume we know nothing.

508
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,443
Which is understating the matter.

509
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,907
We approached within 9,000 miles
of Halley's Comet,

510
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,205
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

511
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:35,542
<i>After we discovered
the bodies,</i>

512
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,419
<i>we transferred them
to the Churchill.</i>

513
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,796
We have in tow,
the three humanoid creatures

514
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,298
and one of the bat-like things.

515
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,924
<i>This is Churchill, we copy.</i>

516
00:46:42,924 --> 00:46:44,217
<i>Welcome back.</i>

517
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,511
You gotten through
to Earth yet, Rawlings?

518
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:49,556
No, sir, and the tail
of the comet's heating up.

519
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:55,979
What's the matter Derebridge?

520
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,397
I don't know, Tom.

521
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,983
I feel drained.

522
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,234
Do you?

523
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,738
I feel invigorated.

524
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,947
You okay?

525
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,241
Yeah.

526
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,453
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

527
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,041
Everybody back
to their stations.

528
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,502
Let's get the hell outta here.

529
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:28,303
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die--

530
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,929
one by one.

531
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:38,521
Rawlings, the radio officer,
was the first to go.

532
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,994
<i>Rawlings denied any knowledge
of what he had done.</i>

533
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:54,454
I don't remember.

534
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:57,540
Rawlings,

535
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,252
besides myself, you're the only one
that's been up here

536
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:02,962
in the last hour.

537
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,341
I've been feeling weak recently.

538
00:48:06,591 --> 00:48:08,176
Not myself.

539
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,138
Just don't remember.

540
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,657
<i>We found Rawlings' body
the next day.</i>

541
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:43,253
Exactly how did he die, Colonel?

542
00:48:44,045 --> 00:48:46,256
The life just drained out of him.

543
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:53,596
<i>One by one...</i>

544
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,643
<i>the rest of the crew
began to die.</i>

545
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,940
<i>Somehow...</i>

546
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,278
<i>I don't know how...</i>

547
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,949
<i>I held out.</i>

548
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:19,289
<i>It just seemed to be
a matter of will.</i>

549
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,417
<i>I always thought...</i>

550
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,257
<i>The girl...</i>

551
00:49:30,508 --> 00:49:32,719
Yes, the girl?

552
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,269
<i>I can't remember.</i>

553
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:59,287
<i>What I remember next is the view
out of the observation window--</i>

554
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,915
<i>coming in to Earth's orbit.</i>

555
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,879
<i>I couldn't expose the world
to what we'd brought back with us.</i>

556
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:30,753
<i>I was determined
to destroy them all.</i>

557
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,658
It was the hardest thing
I ever did.

558
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:02,118
We understand.

559
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,996
Must have taken great courage
to try and make--

560
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,581
No, you don't understand.

561
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:09,751
Part of me didn't wanna leave.

562
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:14,172
She killed all my friends
and I still didn't want to leave.

563
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:17,884
Leaving her was
the hardest thing I ever did.

564
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:24,265
Colonel Carlsen
looks exhausted to me.

565
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:26,893
I think we should allow him
to get some sleep.

566
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,478
Continue with this later.

567
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,021
Very well.

568
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,358
<i>Thank you, Colonel.</i>

569
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,638
NASA tracking and ours

570
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:08,017
have just reported and unusual
structure leaving Halley's Comet.

571
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:09,602
It's headed for us.

572
00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:10,561
What is it?

573
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,108
Radar ranging reports
the object is a needle-like shape,

574
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,818
one hundred and fifty miles long.

575
00:53:17,568 --> 00:53:20,196
<i>Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit</i>

576
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,073
<i>in a little more than two days.</i>

577
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,702
Oh, and I've just received a call
from the Prime Minister.

578
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:28,955
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

579
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,040
PM wants answers.

580
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,193
Close your eyes.

581
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,787
You're giving me your life.

582
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,174
You're taking it.

583
00:55:27,114 --> 00:55:28,741
You're draining me.

584
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,578
You're taking too much of me.

585
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:00,439
It was a dream.

586
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:01,691
Just a dream.

587
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,817
What dream, Carlsen?

588
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,444
The girl, she visited me.

589
00:56:05,444 --> 00:56:07,738
Visited you,
visited you how?

590
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,198
In my mind.

591
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,995
She...she...she...

592
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,581
she had some kind
of mental contact with me.

593
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,875
She's draining me.

594
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,793
Tell us about the dream, Carlsen.

595
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:24,797
I can't, it's gone.

596
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:27,258
It's faded.

597
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,301
I can't remember.

598
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,970
Carlsen, have you ever
been hypnotized?

599
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,096
No.

600
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:33,306
Do you mind
if I have a go at it?

601
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,182
It may help you
with your dreams.

602
00:56:35,182 --> 00:56:37,351
Yeah, let's try it.

603
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,021
Not now, he's too exhausted.

604
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,481
Fine, fine, in the morning.

605
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:45,443
Just stare at it
until your eyes feel tired.

606
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,861
Then close them.

607
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,654
You'll feel very tired.

608
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:52,074
Very sleepy.

609
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:53,784
She seems to...

610
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,705
speak to me in my dreams.

611
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,834
She...

612
00:57:02,835 --> 00:57:05,963
the girl, I feel...

613
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,175
What do you feel
for her, Carlsen?

614
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:13,220
I feel very...

615
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,014
close to her.

616
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,724
Is she in touch with you?

617
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:19,644
I feel...

618
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:22,563
as if my mind...

619
00:57:23,814 --> 00:57:26,067
is not entirely my own.

620
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:29,403
If she is in contact
with your mind, Carlsen,

621
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:31,697
perhaps you are
in contact with hers.

622
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:34,116
Can you see her?

623
00:57:34,867 --> 00:57:36,702
<i>Can you see where she is?</i>

624
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,372
Yes.

625
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,499
<i>Where is she now, Carlsen?</i>

626
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:45,127
<i>A place, I don't know
the name of it.</i>

627
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:46,921
<i>She's walking.</i>

628
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:50,591
<i>She has a different face.</i>

629
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,301
<i>But it's her.</i>

630
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:54,804
<i>A different face,
how can that be?</i>

631
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,514
<i>She's using a different body.</i>

632
00:57:57,723 --> 00:57:59,350
<i>What is she doing?</i>

633
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,060
<i>She's looking for a man.</i>

634
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,728
<i>What man?</i>

635
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:05,064
Any man.

636
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,774
A healthy man.

637
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,442
<i>Does she intend to kill him?</i>

638
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:10,569
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

639
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:12,321
<i>She's afraid of being caught.</i>

640
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:14,031
<i>How could she be caught?</i>

641
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,574
<i>The body'd give her away.</i>

642
00:58:15,574 --> 00:58:17,785
<i>So, what Is she hoplng to do?</i>

643
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,412
<i>She wants to...</i>

644
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:22,081
<i>draw some energy from him.</i>

645
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:24,959
<i>Not enough to kill him.</i>

646
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,669
<i>She can do that?</i>

647
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,546
<i>Yes.</i>

648
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,339
<i>There's another mind.</i>

649
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,925
<i>Yes...</i>

650
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:36,846
the girl's name is Ellen.

651
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,557
You mean there are
two people in one body?

652
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,017
<i>Two minds?</i>

653
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,228
Ellen and the vampire?

654
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:45,771
Yes.

655
00:58:48,315 --> 00:58:50,026
<i>She's watching a man.</i>

656
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:52,153
<i>What is the man doing?</i>

657
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,072
<i>He's parked--</i>

658
00:58:55,072 --> 00:58:56,741
<i>Doing something with his car.</i>

659
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:00,536
License number.

660
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,124
Can you see
the license number of his car?

661
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,625
Yes.

662
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:09,128
<i>Read it out.</i>

663
00:59:09,962 --> 00:59:11,922
<i>F-M-C</i>

664
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,093
<i>1-2-9-E.</i>

665
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:18,888
Or, uh...R.

666
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,681
<i>What is the make of the car?</i>

667
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,145
<i>A white Volvo.</i>

668
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:31,192
<i>What is she doing now?</i>

669
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,570
They're driving.

670
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,947
<i>Does she ask him his name?</i>

671
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,617
<i>She's...</i>

672
00:59:40,993 --> 00:59:43,037
<i>pulling her skirt...</i>

673
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,790
<i>over her knees.</i>

674
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:48,667
<i>She's...</i>

675
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:50,920
<i>He's...</i>

676
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,589
<i>putting his...</i>

677
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,592
<i>his...</i>

678
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,135
<i>hand...</i>

679
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,639
<i>on her le-- on her leg.</i>

680
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:19,782
F-M-C-1-2-9-E or possibly R,

681
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,867
belonging to a white Volvo.

682
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:24,203
The driver of the car picked up
a girl named Ellen.

683
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,956
I have to know who the girl is
and where we can find her.

684
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,041
She's connected with the case.

685
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,460
I can't explain
over an open line.

686
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,337
Thank you.

687
01:00:34,588 --> 01:00:36,882
Do you think he's telling
the truth about the girl?

688
01:00:36,882 --> 01:00:38,801
Well, we'll soon see.

689
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:43,556
How brilliant if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind.

690
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,976
Taking only a small amount
of energy from each victim.

691
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,229
It would make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

692
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,981
She's hoping
to leave no trail.

693
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,192
If the girl is no longer
in her original body,

694
01:00:55,192 --> 01:00:56,402
where is her body?

695
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,821
Hidden.

696
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,281
Let's find it.

697
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,160
Supposing you're right
about all of this,

698
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,744
what about that ship up there?

699
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:07,705
What's it doing?

700
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,540
We can't know that.

701
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,001
But we've got
to assume the worst.

702
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,378
Maybe they're like
the vampires of legend.

703
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:15,337
How's that?

704
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,132
They would carry
their earth with them--

705
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,801
in their coffins, wouldn't they?

706
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,973
<i>We have
a three meter feed from Hawaii.</i>

707
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,725
<i>Here it</i> comes.

708
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,810
<i>Put It on screen number one.</i>

709
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:34,565
Coming in 240,000 miles.

710
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:36,984
My God, it's immense.

711
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:01,717
I say, Hugh, do you have
that skin tissue sample I asked for?

712
01:02:01,717 --> 01:02:02,801
Oh, good.

713
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:05,804
Yes, of course I'll follow
containment procedure.

714
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,057
He's here now.

715
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,851
And Hugh,
send in that soldier, please.

716
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,522
Oh, thank you.

717
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:50,099
Dr. Fallada?

718
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,475
Just one moment, Sergeant.

719
01:02:51,475 --> 01:02:52,601
Thank you for coming around.

720
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,145
I'll be with you shortly.

721
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:08,617
Bloody awful job,
tracing that car.

722
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:11,870
It belongs to a man named Ned Price
who lives in Yorkshire.

723
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:13,831
We have him
under detention now.

724
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:14,873
What about the girl?

725
01:03:14,873 --> 01:03:17,543
The girl he picked up was
a nurse named Ellen.

726
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,628
As you said,
EIIen-something-or-other.

727
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:20,921
He doesn't know her other name.

728
01:03:20,921 --> 01:03:23,173
And he dropped her off
at Thurlstone Hospital

729
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:25,050
after spending
the afternoon with her.

730
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,969
He was most reluctant
to talk about it.

731
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,346
The man's totally exhausted.

732
01:03:29,346 --> 01:03:30,931
Thurlstone.

733
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:32,850
Isn't that an asylum
of some sort?

734
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,936
Yes, for the criminally insane.

735
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:01,295
How do you do, Home Secretary,
I'm Dr. Armstrong,

736
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,963
director of the hospital.

737
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:04,506
Come with me to my office.

738
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,721
What a cold night.

739
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:11,889
Bitterly cold.

740
01:04:13,098 --> 01:04:14,558
This is the nurse's house.

741
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,896
Ellen Donaldson is number five.

742
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,314
Thank you.

743
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,025
Shouldn't I come up
and introduce you?

744
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,109
I'd rather you didn't.

745
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:25,235
Come along, Dr. Armstrong,

746
01:04:25,235 --> 01:04:26,987
you and I have several matters
to discuss.

747
01:04:26,987 --> 01:04:28,197
Come along.

748
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,495
<i>Yes, who is it?</i>

749
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,413
Miss Donaldson,
my name's Colin Caine.

750
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:37,915
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

751
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,124
Id' like to talk to you.

752
01:04:39,124 --> 01:04:40,292
May I come in?

753
01:04:49,968 --> 01:04:51,220
Yes?

754
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:54,723
What do you want?

755
01:04:54,723 --> 01:04:55,974
My name's Colin Caine.

756
01:04:55,974 --> 01:04:58,936
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.

757
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,938
May we come in
and talk to you?

758
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,606
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

759
01:05:12,699 --> 01:05:13,951
May I sit down?

760
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,957
I want to ask you about the man
you spent the afternoon with,

761
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,542
Ned Price.

762
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,587
I don't know
what you're talking about.

763
01:05:25,587 --> 01:05:27,339
<i>I think you do.</i>

764
01:05:27,339 --> 01:05:28,799
Let me see your hand.

765
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:29,925
Beg your pardon?

766
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,598
You're in there, aren't you?

767
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:40,102
I don't know.

768
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,311
Tell me.

769
01:05:41,311 --> 01:05:42,396
No!

770
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,565
Carlsen!

771
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,528
It's gone from her,
it's in another body now.

772
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,654
How do you know that?

773
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:52,948
I can see it in her mind.

774
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,577
She's resisting.

775
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,203
I'm gonna have
to force her to tell me.

776
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:02,249
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

777
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:04,418
An extreme masochist.

778
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,795
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

779
01:06:07,796 --> 01:06:09,715
She wants me to hurt her.

780
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:12,426
I can see the images
in her mind.

781
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:13,802
Do you want to stay?

782
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,471
Otherwise, wait outside!

783
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,638
Not at all.

784
01:06:16,638 --> 01:06:18,557
I am a natural voyeur.

785
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,105
Are you in there?

786
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,741
Are you there?

787
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,331
Let go.

788
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,000
Now!

789
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,168
Now!

790
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,377
Now!

791
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,971
Well?

792
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,764
I've got a physical description.

793
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,233
Doctor, you'd better send someone
to look after Nurse Donaldson.

794
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,442
Is she all right?

795
01:07:52,442 --> 01:07:54,987
If I described one of the inmates
to you, could you identify him?

796
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,321
Possibly.

797
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,533
Big man, fat, gray hair.

798
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:00,826
Birthmark on his face.

799
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:03,787
Jeffrey Sykes,
the child murderer.

800
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:05,497
Where did you get
his description?

801
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:07,583
Where is he now?

802
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,751
He's in solitary confinement.

803
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:11,128
He's been naughty.

804
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,754
Look, what is this about?

805
01:08:12,754 --> 01:08:14,256
What we're looking for
has moved.

806
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,716
We could be here some time.

807
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,342
I better call London.

808
01:08:17,342 --> 01:08:20,178
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.

809
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:21,722
We have to see Sykes now.

810
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,307
Oh, couldn't this wait
until the morning?

811
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:27,185
Oh, all right, I'II arrange it.

812
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:29,146
Anything to oblige,
Commander.

813
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:38,071
I wish this were not
so mysterious.

814
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:41,617
If the police are involved,
haven't I a right to know?

815
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,119
I mean, if you're going to start
messing about my patient.

816
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:50,292
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

817
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:54,212
However, I can tell you it is a matter
of national security.

818
01:08:54,212 --> 01:08:55,714
I see.

819
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:59,217
But, don't you think
that I should be present in any case

820
01:08:59,217 --> 01:09:01,178
to represent the interests
of my patient.

821
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:03,138
- You <i>300--
-</i> Can I talk to you for a second?

822
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:04,222
Of course.

823
01:09:04,222 --> 01:09:08,185
Uh...the man has the IQ
of a child of four.

824
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:10,395
Well, that's a decision,
I'm afraid,

825
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:12,272
I shall have to defer
to Colonel Caine.

826
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:13,815
Yes, of course
you can come along.

827
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:15,150
Can we start now?

828
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:16,652
What are you going
to do to him?

829
01:09:17,861 --> 01:09:19,237
I'd like to hypnotize him.

830
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,242
What's that?

831
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:26,787
Pentothal and morphine.

832
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:30,540
I'd recommend it for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

833
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,262
Well, he seems quiet.

834
01:09:45,305 --> 01:09:46,765
We're ready when you are.

835
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,558
- Lamson.
- Sir.

836
01:10:12,332 --> 01:10:13,959
Can the injection be dangerous?

837
01:10:14,584 --> 01:10:16,962
He should have
no difficulty tolerating it.

838
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,296
<i>There's always a risk, sir.</i>

839
01:10:20,298 --> 01:10:21,508
<i>May I have that?</i>

840
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,428
Well, I'll wake him up.

841
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:29,391
- What are you doing!
- Stay where you are.

842
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,310
He's sick, Lamson, help us,
I can't explain now.

843
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:37,482
There's our killer, Sir Percy.

844
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,388
It's madness.

845
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:12,184
I want to question him
before it wears off.

846
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,518
Where can we take him?

847
01:11:13,518 --> 01:11:14,770
Up the ramp, sir.

848
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,665
We need to be alone
for a minute, Lamson.

849
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,635
How the devil
did you know it was him?

850
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,387
In the nurses quarters
he touched me on the shoulder.

851
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,766
I saw into his mind.

852
01:11:54,559 --> 01:11:55,936
What?

853
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:58,772
The Colonel appears to be able
to see in the minds

854
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:02,067
of people who have been possessed
by the girl creature, sir.

855
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,319
It happens when I touch 'em.

856
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:08,406
Let's get him on the table.

857
01:12:16,873 --> 01:12:18,083
How?

858
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,753
How do you know
she's still inside Armstrong?

859
01:12:21,753 --> 01:12:24,297
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone else?

860
01:12:24,297 --> 01:12:26,967
She's trapped.

861
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,635
I can feel that.

862
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,095
Are you sure?

863
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,306
No.

864
01:12:37,894 --> 01:12:39,396
- Lamson.
- Sir?

865
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,231
Can you bring me another dose
of the hypnotic drug?

866
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:43,275
I suppose so, sir.

867
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,693
One dose is usually enough.

868
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,278
This is not a usual situation.

869
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:49,114
How long does the stuff last?

870
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,365
A dose like that?

871
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:51,324
A couple of hours.

872
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:54,077
We'll definitely need more.

873
01:12:54,744 --> 01:12:56,621
Bring me three doses.

874
01:12:56,621 --> 01:12:58,665
- Three?
- I'll take responsibility, Lamson--

875
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:00,375
Sir Percy and myself,
just get on with it.

876
01:13:01,751 --> 01:13:03,128
Yes, sir.

877
01:13:05,213 --> 01:13:06,882
Is a second dose safe?

878
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,884
Surely it can strain his heart.

879
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:12,888
Look...you don't know
what we're dealing with here.

880
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:15,891
If he slips out from under,

881
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,518
<i>she'“ escape.</i>

882
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:35,619
Armstrong, can you hear me?

883
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:40,874
Armstrong, if you can hear me,
just say yes.

884
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,839
It...

885
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,175
won't let me...

886
01:13:51,092 --> 01:13:54,262
ta-- talk to you.

887
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:15,325
Armstrong,
Armstrong!

888
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,370
Can you see what it is
that's holding you prisoner?

889
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:25,377
Yes, yes, she--

890
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,087
Tell her she has
to talk to me!

891
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,421
Tell her!

892
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:29,798
Yes?

893
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,387
Pentothal,
I brought the pentothal.

894
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:37,055
Thanks, Lamson, that'll be all.

895
01:14:42,894 --> 01:14:44,562
No.

896
01:14:44,562 --> 01:14:45,772
Hold him.

897
01:14:53,738 --> 01:14:55,490
There's no need for that.

898
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,326
No need.

899
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,468
<i>You in there,</i>

900
01:15:16,594 --> 01:15:17,971
can you still hear me?

901
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:23,351
Can you get into his mind?
Her mind?

902
01:15:23,351 --> 01:15:25,645
Not with this drug,
it's like a wall.

903
01:15:25,645 --> 01:15:27,439
Perhaps you've given him
too much.

904
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,315
- Perhaps we--
- Shut up!

905
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,905
Listen, you bitch,

906
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:40,118
I'll keep you in this state
for weeks, if I have to.

907
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:41,828
Now, you talk to me.

908
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:44,539
Carlsen, be with me.

909
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,958
What do you want from me?

910
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:48,251
I love you.

911
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,049
<i>What are you?</i>

912
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,967
Why are you so human?

913
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:57,552
So perfect?

914
01:15:58,928 --> 01:16:00,805
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

915
01:16:00,805 --> 01:16:03,600
Our bodies are unimportant.

916
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:07,479
<i>As you and your men
have approached in your ship,</i>

917
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:09,105
<i>we changed them.</i>

918
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:10,148
For you.

919
01:16:11,107 --> 01:16:12,984
<i>We entered your minds</i>

920
01:16:12,984 --> 01:16:14,903
<i>and found there new bodies.</i>

921
01:16:15,987 --> 01:16:18,323
I took my shape
from your mind.

922
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:21,076
<i>I took your language.</i>

923
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,871
I became the woman
I found there,

924
01:16:25,288 --> 01:16:27,165
in your deepest thoughts,

925
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,626
your deepest needs.

926
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,255
I am the feminine
in your mind, Carlsen.

927
01:16:36,841 --> 01:16:38,635
Where are you?

928
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,513
Where are you!

929
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,390
Where's your body!

930
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,894
Let me go!
Let me go!

931
01:16:48,311 --> 01:16:51,356
Let me go!
Let me go!

932
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,319
Touch me, Carlsen.

933
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:57,862
Let me go.

934
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:00,615
Let me go.

935
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:03,243
Let me go!

936
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,037
Let me go!

937
01:17:08,164 --> 01:17:11,084
Let me go.
Let me go!

938
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,588
Let me go!

939
01:17:17,298 --> 01:17:18,633
Let me go.

940
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:23,304
Let me go.

941
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,710
- It's already spraadlng.
- How?

942
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,420
You didn't stop it,
it's too late.

943
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:40,048
That's impossible, we've been only
half a step behind her all the way.

944
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,299
Sir, this gentleman's
stopped breathing.

945
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:44,552
There's no pulse either.

946
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:56,814
Sir, I think his neck is broken.

947
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,570
Lampson, prepare two stretchers.

948
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:04,489
One for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

949
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,908
Prepare all your remaining doses
of the drug for travel.

950
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,201
Yes, sir.

951
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,377
You said the thing
hadn't stopped,

952
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:19,045
it was still spreading.

953
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:20,338
Why did you say that?

954
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:22,465
I don't know.

955
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:24,717
Could the girl have been deliberately
leading us away from London?

956
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:27,971
Is it possible we didn't find
all of her victims?

957
01:19:29,138 --> 01:19:30,473
If we didn't find all
the victims,

958
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:32,183
if there are others
besides the girl in the park.

959
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:34,227
The thing would spread.

960
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:37,730
And a chain reaction,
geometrically, until by now...

961
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:40,650
Oh, Christ.

962
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:18,271
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to get through to the S.R.C. in London?

963
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:19,939
Just a moment, sir,
there's something coming through.

964
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,818
It is the S.R.C., sir,
for you and Carlsen.

965
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:28,531
Go ahead.

966
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:31,743
<i>Caine, can you hear me?</i>

967
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:34,912
Fallada, speak up,
I can't hear you.

968
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:38,041
<i>The two males didn't die.</i>

969
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,794
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soldiers who shot them

970
01:20:41,794 --> 01:20:45,089
and transformed the soldiers bodies
into their own likenesses.

971
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:47,467
That's the difference between them
and their victims.

972
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:49,218
<i>The victims can't leave
their bodies.</i>

973
01:20:49,218 --> 01:20:51,512
<i>Only the original three
can do that.</i>

974
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:52,972
But I've killed one of them.

975
01:20:53,931 --> 01:20:57,185
- One of which?
- One of the two male vampires.

976
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,729
One of the transformed ones.

977
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,731
How did you kill him,
Fallada, how?

978
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:03,941
The old way, Carlsen.

979
01:21:03,941 --> 01:21:08,279
A leaded metal shaft,
penetrating not through the heart,

980
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:12,200
but through the energy center
two inches below the heart.

981
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,370
Not steel, but leaded iron.

982
01:21:15,828 --> 01:21:17,413
<i>Right, Carlsen?</i>

983
01:21:18,414 --> 01:21:20,166
<i>Are you there, Carlsen?</i>

984
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,043
Yes.

985
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:25,046
<i>Carlsen, you too, Caine,</i>

986
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:28,841
it is my belief
that the vampires of legend

987
01:21:28,841 --> 01:21:31,677
came from creatures
such as these.

988
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:35,056
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

989
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,642
I know it sounds incredible.

990
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,187
Do you hear me, Carlsen!

991
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:45,650
It's morn than a ballot, Fallada...
It's true.

992
01:21:46,859 --> 01:21:48,528
They visited Earth before.

993
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,115
What about
the other male, Fallada?

994
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:53,908
He's free.

995
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:56,369
<i>You have the girl?</i>

996
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:57,578
<i>Yes.</i>

997
01:21:57,578 --> 01:22:00,039
We'll be with you
as soon as we can, hold on.

998
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:01,249
<i>We'll try.</i>

999
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,337
This came through
while you were talking, sir.

1000
01:22:06,337 --> 01:22:08,548
- What is it?
- A scrambled cryptogram.

1001
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,800
It's to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

1002
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,428
We're to proceed directly
to the Citadel at Whitehall.

1003
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,722
<i>Came--</i>

1004
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:57,013
Lieutenant, the controls!

1005
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:13,112
<i>We've lost her. she's gone.</i>

1006
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:15,573
Where?

1007
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:17,492
Her body's in London.

1008
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,659
Where in London?

1009
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:23,873
Carlsen, you've got to tell me
what happened,

1010
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:25,750
what really happened
on the Churchill.

1011
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:31,047
It wasn't Rawlings who destroyed
the radio equipment.

1012
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:32,798
And the ship's tapes.

1013
01:23:33,799 --> 01:23:35,051
It was me.

1014
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:36,052
Why?

1015
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:38,679
I didn't want the Churchill
to be able to reach Earth.

1016
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:42,391
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

1017
01:23:42,391 --> 01:23:43,726
What did happen?

1018
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:47,355
I opened her sealed
animation case.

1019
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:52,109
Either I did it or she did it.

1020
01:23:53,819 --> 01:23:55,613
I couldn't help myself.

1021
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:58,658
I've never experienced such--

1022
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:03,538
I was in love on a level
you've never known, Caine.

1023
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:11,003
<i>It terrifies me.</i>

1024
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:14,382
<i>My memory plays tricks on me.</i>

1025
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:19,971
<i>She was calling me.</i>

1026
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:25,017
<i>Her power was...spiritual.</i>

1027
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,633
<i>She wanted me, Caine.</i>

1028
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,765
<i>It was more than spiritual.</i>

1029
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:19,572
<i>She took some of my energy.</i>

1030
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:25,077
<i>And she gave me
some of her energy.</i>

1031
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,880
<i>They must have been living off
of each other when we found them.</i>

1032
01:25:37,089 --> 01:25:39,050
<i>There were only three
of them left.</i>

1033
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:43,137
<i>She killed all of my men.</i>

1034
01:25:44,513 --> 01:25:46,015
<i>One by one.</i>

1035
01:25:47,516 --> 01:25:49,101
<i>But I survived.</i>

1036
01:25:50,227 --> 01:25:51,937
<i>She wanted me to survive.</i>

1037
01:25:53,147 --> 01:25:54,565
<i>She chose me!</i>

1038
01:25:55,816 --> 01:25:58,319
<i>Why, why!</i>

1039
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:01,697
Carlsen, she's not human,
she's not a woman.

1040
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:03,366
She'll destroy you.

1041
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:07,453
She's destroyed worlds.

1042
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:09,789
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

1043
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:12,124
A special bulletin
from the BBC.

1044
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:14,877
<i>It's obvious that tonight,</i>

1045
01:26:14,877 --> 01:26:18,214
<i>London is on the brink of the worst
devastation since the blitz.</i>

1046
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:19,507
<i>From where I'm standing,</i>

1047
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:23,594
<i>I can see large areas of the city
burning out of control.</i>

1048
01:26:23,594 --> 01:26:26,889
<i>And thousands of people are now
rampaging through the streets here</i>

1049
01:26:26,889 --> 01:26:30,226
<i>in a frenzied last effort
to avoid the plague.</i>

1050
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:32,937
<i>Martial law has been enforced now
for three hours</i>

1051
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:35,439
<i>But for the moment,
it hasn't stemmed what is obviously...</i>

1052
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,203
Yes, sir, we've been
expecting you.

1053
01:27:31,203 --> 01:27:32,580
Thank you, carry on.

1054
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,582
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- <i>Right, sir.</i>

1055
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,250
- Hilggins, around the other side.
- nght.

1056
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:47,845
<i>ls everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?</i>

1057
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:48,971
<i>Yes, everything.</i>

1058
01:27:48,971 --> 01:27:50,806
<i>Please take e seat. gentlemen.</i>

1059
01:27:54,935 --> 01:27:59,732
Sir, I have Colonel Caine
and Colonel Carlsen here for you, sir.

1060
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:01,609
Very good.

1061
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:04,403
The Prime Minister
will see you shortly.

1062
01:28:04,403 --> 01:28:05,946
Uh, would you care for a cup of tea,
while you wait?

1063
01:28:05,946 --> 01:28:08,407
No, our business is
rather urgent.

1064
01:28:08,407 --> 01:28:10,951
Yes, I'm sure the Prime Minister
understands that.

1065
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:12,953
- Oh, uh, gentlemen?
- Prime Minister.

1066
01:28:12,953 --> 01:28:14,705
I'm Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service,

1067
01:28:14,705 --> 01:28:17,708
and I'm sure you've heard of
Colonel Carlsen, late of the Churchill.

1068
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:21,587
Oh, ye-- yes, indeed, uh, gentlemen,
I look forward to hearing your report.

1069
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:23,631
By the way, uh,
where is Sir Percy?

1070
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:25,257
Dead, I'm afraid.

1071
01:28:25,257 --> 01:28:27,343
Oh, that's a great pity.

1072
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:31,430
<i>Sir, we have information regarding
the object in space,</i>

1073
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:33,015
<i>which is bearing down on the Earth
at this moment--</i>

1074
01:28:33,015 --> 01:28:36,769
Ye-ye-yes, gentlemen, look, if you'll
excuse me just-- just for a moment.

1075
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:39,688
Mi-- Miss Haversham,
please come this way.

1076
01:28:39,688 --> 01:28:42,775
Miss Haversham, here,
for a moment.

1077
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:44,652
I'll be back, gentlemen,
I'll be back.

1078
01:28:53,452 --> 01:28:55,120
<i>Miss Haversham,</i>

1079
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,834
Miss Haversham,
come this way.

1080
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,044
<i>Miss Haversham, please.</i>

1081
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:11,971
Mind his head.

1082
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:13,347
<i>Go and get
the doctor immediately.</i>

1083
01:29:15,057 --> 01:29:16,600
Hey, what's happening
down there?

1084
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,437
<i>Need a doctor over here.</i>

1085
01:29:34,618 --> 01:29:36,328
Go, go!

1086
01:30:03,856 --> 01:30:06,025
Lieutenant, do you have
any weapons aboard the craft?

1087
01:30:06,025 --> 01:30:08,777
No, sir, uh,
there's a flare pistol, sir.

1088
01:30:08,777 --> 01:30:09,820
Where is it?

1089
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,447
Just close the breach
and it's ready to fire.

1090
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:22,666
Sir, while you were with the PM,
I had a call from base operations.

1091
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:24,460
The city is now
under martial law.

1092
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,170
We've been placed
under NATO command.

1093
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,504
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.

1094
01:30:27,504 --> 01:30:29,340
My unit's been mobilized
across the river

1095
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,799
to a staging area
at Blackheath.

1096
01:30:30,799 --> 01:30:33,469
Land at the S.R.C., Lieutenant,
we've got to talk to Fallada.

1097
01:30:33,469 --> 01:30:35,262
<i>I've been ordered to land
at Blackheath, sir.</i>

1098
01:30:35,262 --> 01:30:37,556
<i>The city's now
under air quarantine.</i>

1099
01:30:37,556 --> 01:30:39,642
<i>If we don't do as they say,
they'll shoot us out of the air.</i>

1100
01:30:45,814 --> 01:30:49,276
Hello, zero, this is x-ray 3-1-8
requesting clearance to land-- over.

1101
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:52,237
<i>Zero roger, x-ray 3-1-8,
you are clear to land.</i>

1102
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:04,124
Come away from the aircraft.

1103
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:05,542
You are under quarantine.

1104
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:08,671
Over here, please, sir.

1105
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:12,633
Don't come any closer,
stop there!

1106
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,885
I want to talk
to your commanding officer.

1107
01:31:14,885 --> 01:31:17,304
I am Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service.

1108
01:31:17,304 --> 01:31:20,099
And this man
is Colonel Tom Carlsen,

1109
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:23,394
United States Air Force and former
commander of the Churchill.

1110
01:31:24,019 --> 01:31:26,146
<i>c company, be on stand-by.</i>

1111
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:30,567
Is Dr. Hans Fallada here
from the S.R.C.?

1112
01:31:30,567 --> 01:31:32,444
He knows who we are
and what's going on.

1113
01:31:32,444 --> 01:31:34,530
No, not that I know of.

1114
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,740
- Has anybody heard of him?
- No.

1115
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,117
Must still be in London.

1116
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:41,578
Colonel, what exactly do you know
about what's happening over there?

1117
01:31:41,578 --> 01:31:43,288
All we know
for certain, Colonel,

1118
01:31:43,288 --> 01:31:46,583
is that a terrible plague
of some sort is sweeping London.

1119
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:49,503
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

1120
01:31:49,503 --> 01:31:51,672
<i>And until that time
has elapsed,</i>

1121
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:54,091
I cannot release you
from this compound.

1122
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:55,968
Colonel, we know
what the plague is.

1123
01:31:55,968 --> 01:31:57,386
We are not infected.

1124
01:31:57,386 --> 01:32:00,264
I know what I'm talking about
and we're wasting valuable time.

1125
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:06,478
We have totally isolated London
in order to stop further contagion.

1126
01:32:06,478 --> 01:32:10,190
If that fails and the surrounding
areas are threatened,

1127
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:11,150
Yes?

1128
01:32:12,234 --> 01:32:16,363
Sterilization by thermonuclear device
has been approved.

1129
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:19,950
<i>We have this
from General Ames in Brussels.</i>

1130
01:32:21,076 --> 01:32:23,829
He's coming up
with that decision in...

1131
01:32:23,829 --> 01:32:25,998
Just under three hours.

1132
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:27,791
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

1133
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:29,251
<i>Corporal Adams...</i>

1134
01:32:29,251 --> 01:32:31,503
- The ship?
- The thing from Halley's Comet.

1135
01:32:31,503 --> 01:32:34,214
Oh...

1136
01:32:34,214 --> 01:32:37,009
It's parked itself
in a geostationary orbit...

1137
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:38,802
Directly over London.

1138
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:54,443
<i>Would air adjutant report
to Major Grover in GHQ.</i>

1139
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:59,406
All those little blue lights going up
toward the clouds,

1140
01:33:00,699 --> 01:33:02,576
<i>they're human souls.</i>

1141
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,621
How do you know that?

1142
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:07,081
I feel it.

1143
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:10,667
<i>The process of conversion
releases a life energy.</i>

1144
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:11,919
<i>Then it can be collected.</i>

1145
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,337
Collected?

1146
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,423
Is that what the umbrella is?

1147
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:18,634
Collector?

1148
01:33:18,967 --> 01:33:21,136
<i>The energy doesn't go free.</i>

1149
01:33:21,136 --> 01:33:22,638
<i>It goes up there.</i>

1150
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:46,411
<i>The male vampire's
collecting life energy.</i>

1151
01:33:47,663 --> 01:33:51,291
But he has to send it through her
to get it up to the collector.

1152
01:33:53,043 --> 01:33:54,753
Where is she, Carlsen?

1153
01:33:57,631 --> 01:33:59,550
Over there.

1154
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,510
<i>I get flashes coming
from her body.</i>

1155
01:34:02,636 --> 01:34:04,388
<i>Sensitive to its environment.</i>

1156
01:34:05,305 --> 01:34:06,807
<i>Picks up things.</i>

1157
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,517
<i>Can you find her?</i>

1158
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:10,435
<i>I” can get across to the city.</i>

1159
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:13,021
<i>What about the male?</i>

1160
01:34:13,021 --> 01:34:15,774
<i>He'll come
if he senses I've found her.</i>

1161
01:34:15,774 --> 01:34:17,609
<i>She's drawing me, Caine.</i>

1162
01:34:17,609 --> 01:34:19,027
<i>Caflsen.</i>

1163
01:34:19,027 --> 01:34:20,070
<i>I've gotta go.</i>

1164
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:24,032
Why?

1165
01:34:24,032 --> 01:34:26,285
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

1166
01:34:29,913 --> 01:34:31,790
When they take on
a new life form

1167
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,210
they have to learn
from that life form.

1168
01:34:36,128 --> 01:34:38,046
Mate with it, in a sense.

1169
01:34:40,507 --> 01:34:42,259
The girl chose me.

1170
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:48,098
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herself.

1171
01:34:50,642 --> 01:34:52,895
And now she wants
that part back.

1172
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:56,523
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector?

1173
01:34:56,523 --> 01:34:58,400
- Over.
- No, sir.

1174
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,694
Okay, keep me posted-- over.

1175
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:02,070
Colonel, listen to me.

1176
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:04,406
Carlsen believes
he can locate the source.

1177
01:35:04,406 --> 01:35:06,033
There are only two carriers.

1178
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:09,745
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

1179
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:11,747
But we only have
an hour and a half.

1180
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,540
<i>What was that?</i>

1181
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:15,292
Cease firing!

1182
01:35:16,418 --> 01:35:18,587
Caflson?

1183
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:19,838
Where's Carlsen?

1184
01:35:19,838 --> 01:35:22,424
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored Land Rover.

1185
01:35:22,424 --> 01:35:24,760
Oh, bloody hell, did he say anything
about where he was going?

1186
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,137
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was?

1187
01:35:27,137 --> 01:35:29,514
Rogers told him, the next thing I knew,
I was on the ground, sir.

1188
01:35:29,514 --> 01:35:30,766
Right, whose is this car?

1189
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:33,477
- That, that's the Colonel's, sir.
- Give me the keys.

1190
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:34,811
- What?
- You heard me.

1191
01:35:34,811 --> 01:35:37,272
Give me the bloody keys,
I'm commandeering the car!

1192
01:35:37,272 --> 01:35:38,232
Give it to him.

1193
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:41,860
And your side arm.

1194
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:46,949
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1195
01:35:48,825 --> 01:35:51,411
You realize once you're inside there,
we can't allow you out.

1196
01:35:53,747 --> 01:35:55,040
<i>Where is he going?</i>

1197
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:03,882
Colonel Caine, S.A.S.,
I'm crossing the river.

1198
01:36:03,882 --> 01:36:05,133
You don't want to go
in there, sir.

1199
01:36:05,133 --> 01:36:06,385
I know I don't.

1200
01:36:08,136 --> 01:36:09,721
Get them gates
in position!

1201
01:36:09,721 --> 01:36:11,515
Secure this post-- move!

1202
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:52,222
<i>Carlsen, Carlsen.</i>

1203
01:37:12,784 --> 01:37:14,953
<i>Caflsen.</i>

1204
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,249
<i>Caflsen.</i>

1205
01:37:19,249 --> 01:37:20,792
Carlsen.

1206
01:37:21,585 --> 01:37:24,921
Carlsen.
Carlsen.

1207
01:38:33,615 --> 01:38:37,327
Car/sen.
<i>Car/sen.</i>

1208
01:40:09,836 --> 01:40:11,171
FaHada?

1209
01:40:11,171 --> 01:40:12,714
Caine.

1210
01:40:12,714 --> 01:40:14,007
<i>I'm glad to see you alive.</i>

1211
01:40:15,634 --> 01:40:17,969
I reciprocate the sentiment.

1212
01:40:18,637 --> 01:40:20,263
Is he really dead?

1213
01:40:20,263 --> 01:40:21,389
This time?

1214
01:40:21,389 --> 01:40:23,433
<i>The only way
they can be killed.</i>

1215
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,360
Where's Bukovsky?

1216
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,569
<i>Dead.</i>

1217
01:40:35,654 --> 01:40:37,531
How?

1218
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:38,782
Like the rest.

1219
01:40:41,117 --> 01:40:42,410
How did you survive?

1220
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:48,959
You're looking for Carlsen.

1221
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,670
Has he been here?

1222
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,548
No, perhaps he misled you.

1223
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:55,840
What do you know about it?

1224
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,509
I've been doing some more work.

1225
01:40:58,051 --> 01:40:59,302
Go on.

1226
01:40:59,302 --> 01:41:00,595
I discovered

1227
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:04,975
there is life after death.

1228
01:41:04,975 --> 01:41:05,976
How do you know?

1229
01:41:06,768 --> 01:41:11,106
There is a certain
mental transference, telepathy,

1230
01:41:11,106 --> 01:41:14,401
that occurs between the vampires
and their victims.

1231
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:18,738
Carlsen is after the girl.

1232
01:41:20,156 --> 01:41:21,449
How did you know that?

1233
01:41:21,449 --> 01:41:23,159
Oh, I...

1234
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:26,037
I seem to sense it.

1235
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:28,915
Where is she, Fallada?

1236
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:32,586
Don't you know?

1237
01:41:35,797 --> 01:41:37,591
<i>Carlsen knows.</i>

1238
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:38,675
Where, Fallada?

1239
01:41:39,718 --> 01:41:41,469
She's in the cathedral.

1240
01:41:42,554 --> 01:41:44,598
She's been there
since she escaped.

1241
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,851
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

1242
01:41:48,518 --> 01:41:51,688
The crypt of kings
and queens.

1243
01:41:51,688 --> 01:41:52,772
Stay where you are.

1244
01:41:55,525 --> 01:41:56,735
Stay where you are!

1245
01:42:13,501 --> 01:42:15,128
Here I go.

1246
01:43:32,497 --> 01:43:34,541
I know you would come,
Carlson.

1247
01:44:18,918 --> 01:44:20,253
<i>I'm here.</i>

1248
01:44:20,962 --> 01:44:23,381
Now can this madness end?

1249
01:44:24,257 --> 01:44:25,884
Come.

1250
01:44:26,968 --> 01:44:28,094
Be with me.

1251
01:44:29,345 --> 01:44:31,681
<i>I need you.</i>

1252
01:44:31,681 --> 01:44:34,017
It was always intended

1253
01:44:34,017 --> 01:44:38,062
you should find us
and bring us to Earth.

1254
01:44:45,403 --> 01:44:49,157
The web of destiny carries
your blood and soul

1255
01:44:49,365 --> 01:44:52,869
back to the genesis
of my life form.

1256
01:44:53,578 --> 01:44:54,913
Come.

1257
01:44:56,122 --> 01:44:57,707
Be with me.

1258
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:00,835
Come with me, Carlsen.

1259
01:48:13,152 --> 01:48:16,572
It'll be much less terrifying
if you just come to me.

1260
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,705
I'll do just that.

1261
01:49:46,621 --> 01:49:48,873
<i>Cansen!</i>

1262
01:49:51,584 --> 01:49:53,461
What are these feelings?

1263
01:49:53,461 --> 01:49:56,005
Why do I feel so close to you?

1264
01:49:56,005 --> 01:49:57,381
Need you?

1265
01:49:57,381 --> 01:49:58,674
Because you're one of us.

1266
01:50:00,301 --> 01:50:01,427
You always have been.

1267
01:50:01,844 --> 01:50:03,179
You're like me.

1268
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:04,639
Be with me.

1269
01:50:16,317 --> 01:50:19,487
Just a little more.
Just a little more.

1270
01:50:23,991 --> 01:50:26,369
<i>Cansen!</i>

1271
01:50:28,329 --> 01:50:30,957
<i>Cansen!</i>

1272
01:50:38,673 --> 01:50:40,633
Carlsen!

1273
01:50:46,514 --> 01:50:47,890
Carlsen!

1274
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:03,281
Caine!
