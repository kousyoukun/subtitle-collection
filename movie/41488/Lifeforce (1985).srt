1
00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:44,355
August 9, 2:30 p.m.
Greenwich Mean Time.

2
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:46,690
The H.M.S. Churchill,
outward bound.

3
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:49,562
On board: a joint
British-American space team.

4
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:54,002
Their mission: to intercept and study
the comet bearing Dr. Hailey's name.

5
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,006
The Churchill is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.

6
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:00,872
It propels the Churchill
with constant acceleration...

7
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:04,608
enough to create Earth-type gravity for
the first time on an extended flight.

8
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:08,983
The Churchill is on course
for its rendezvous.

9
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:11,817
- Sir, this is odd.
- What?

10
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:13,448
I'm getting a small radar
cross section...

11
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,688
just ahead of the nucleus
in the coma of the comet.

12
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,993
I've got it too. Check the length.
It's at the limit of my scan angle.

13
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:23,160
- What's going on?
- You run an equipment check?

14
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:24,861
Every five minutes.

15
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,838
- Radar states 150 miles.
- 150 miles what?

16
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:30,841
- Length.
- 150 miles long?

17
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,871
What's 150 miles long?

18
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,606
It's a radar trace.

19
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,207
- Something in the coma of the comet.
- Show me.

20
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,687
- E.G.R. is confirmed.
- Looks good.

21
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:44,189
E.G.R. is optimal.

22
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:45,813
Track three on three.

23
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,325
Roger.

24
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,328
What's its height?

25
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:53,696
I've got a vertical reading
of two miles at least.

26
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,134
Ambient temperature: six degrees.

27
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:58,569
Less than two percent traces
of manganese, titanium--

28
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,071
Try and raise base.

29
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:02,974
Tell them we have an artificial
object out here hidden--

30
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:06,810
- Are you sure you want to say "hidden"?
- It's located in the head of the comet.

31
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,644
Keep sending that
until they acknowledge.

32
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:11,480
Use a secured downlink.

33
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:14,578
Sorry, Commander, everything's
been swamped by the coma winds.

34
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,715
We can't get anything back to base.

35
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,816
How long is the blackout period?

36
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:20,920
all the way.

37
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,006
What are you gonna do?

38
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:36,510
Go on in.

39
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:41,145
We're only gonna get one chance,
Derebridge.

40
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:46,180
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years...

41
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,849
and we'll both be dead.

42
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,017
We have to take a look now.

43
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:04,069
- Shut down Nerva.
- Shutting down.

44
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:05,973
Down.

45
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:20,824
- Solar panels retracted.
- Check. Give me a readout, Bob.

46
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,528
Executing E.V.A. maneuver.

47
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:14,306
Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

48
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,584
- Was it exploring the comet?
- Come on, guys, let's do it.

49
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,982
The surface looks badly pitted.

50
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,152
In that case,
it's been here a long time.

51
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:28,320
It's derelict, whatever it is.

52
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:31,490
Stand by, Churchill.
We're going in.

53
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:34,832
Roger, Carlsen.
We copy. We have you going in.

54
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:43,005
Churchill, it looks like
some giant artery, organic.

55
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:45,843
I almost have the feeling
I've been here before.

56
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,683
Oh, boy.

57
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:00,795
This is incredible.

58
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:04,129
I hope you can appreciate
the scale of this on the video.

59
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:06,796
Roger. We're getting it.
It's all on tape.

60
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,240
Oh, shit.

61
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:15,302
Whoa. Here they are.

62
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,455
Churchill...

63
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:28,585
it looks like we found the occupants
of the ship.

64
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:33,896
They look like giant bats.

65
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:48,774
- There must be hundreds of them.
- Thousands.

66
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,111
Dead, I hope.

67
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,291
Looks prehistoric.

68
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:19,178
It's completely desiccated.

69
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:28,414
- Crumbles.
- Yes, it would.

70
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:31,721
all the fluid's been lost
to space over the years.

71
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:43,028
we'll bag this one,
take it with us.

72
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:46,905
We're deploying
the specimen bag.

73
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:05,961
Jesus.

74
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,760
What the hell is that?

75
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,799
Commander...

76
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,234
the ship has just deployed a--

77
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:17,330
It looks like some sort
of big structure that's just unfolding.

78
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:18,932
It's enormous.

79
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:23,372
God, what is it?

80
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:31,853
We must get out of here.

81
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,824
Nobody's going anywhere.
Stay where you are.

82
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:38,492
Churchill, this is Carlsen.
What's happening out there?

83
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,259
The thing stopped opening.

84
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:44,564
The only way to describe it is
it's like a giant umbrella.

85
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:48,572
Good God.
It's absolutely enormous.

86
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,437
What's it doing now?

87
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:52,977
Nothing, sir.

88
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,577
It's stopped opening.

89
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,881
It's just sitting there.

90
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:04,822
- Can you tell what it's made of?
- Not metal.

91
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,689
It's radar transparent.

92
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,591
Okay.

93
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,894
If it starts up again,
let me know.

94
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,366
Any activity out there.
You understand?

95
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:16,869
Yes, sir.

96
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,014
That's where we're going.

97
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:28,469
There's something there.

98
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,845
Commander, this is Churchill.

99
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:33,885
We're losing our signal.
We've lost V.T.R.

100
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:35,681
Come in, Commander!

101
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:57,042
Three bodies.

102
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,168
Perfectly preserved.

103
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:04,609
They look to me
to be like an--

104
00:11:04,684 --> 00:11:07,676
Something's happening to me.

105
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,187
What's wrong with me?

106
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,373
Commander, come in.

107
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:30,377
This is Churchill.
Do you copy?

108
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:38,043
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sleep.

109
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,586
Hold on.
We're coming down.

110
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:05,771
Churchill, if you read...

111
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:09,011
there are two nude males
and one female.

112
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:13,648
This is Churchill.
We have no picture. Come in, Tom.

113
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:18,627
Churchill,
I said we found a young girl.

114
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,564
"girl"? You mean human?

115
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:24,032
Definitely humanoid.

116
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:26,035
I'd say she's perfect.

117
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:29,540
I've been in space for six months.
She looks perfect to me.

118
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:39,408
- Derebridge, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

119
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:56,427
- How many do you want to take back?
- I say we take back all three...

120
00:12:56,502 --> 00:12:59,665
and one of the dead things
in the other chamber.

121
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:03,540
Let's see if we can break them free.

122
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:26,531
Churchill, come in.
This is Mission Control, Great Britain.

123
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:28,534
Do you copy?

124
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:31,298
If they're going to pick us up,
they should get us this close.

125
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:33,601
Simply aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.

126
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:36,701
Automatic circuits don't even respond.

127
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:39,973
They're radio dead.

128
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:43,882
Christ, I hope it's just
their communications.

129
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:57,294
How's their orbit look?

130
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:00,803
You can see it's stable,
but they're slightly off.

131
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,303
They should have adjusted
coming in...

132
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:03,930
but they haven't.

133
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:05,440
What do you make of that?

134
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:07,873
It would appear that
they set their course...

135
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:11,380
just after they left the comet
and haven't updated it since.

136
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:21,086
- The Columbia?
- The Columbia.

137
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:24,355
We have a liftoff.

138
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,191
Tower cleared.

139
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:44,011
Control, this is Columbia.

140
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,107
Are we cleared
to initiate docking procedure?

141
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:48,709
Go ahead, Columbia.
You are looking good.

142
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:51,255
Stand by for soft dock.

143
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,857
Soft dock.

144
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,395
Soft dock confirmed.

145
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:13,905
Columbia,
the ship's completely gutted.

146
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:15,468
Oh, my God.

147
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:19,777
Houston, we have a problem.
There's been a fire.

148
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:28,520
I'll take a look in the tug bay.
You two, try the top deck.

149
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,147
Columbia, they're all dead.

150
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:01,652
Nothing down here, Columbia.
I'm going into the tug bay.

151
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:06,431
I'll get the tapes.

152
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:38,830
Somner...

153
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:41,391
there's something you ought to see
in the tug bay.

154
00:17:57,184 --> 00:18:01,680
I see.
How did you open the girl's case?

155
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:03,485
We didn't, Minister.

156
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,359
We were talking about how to get it open
when it popped open of its own accord.

157
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,728
- Did you X-ray the crystal cases?
- We're not certain they're crystal.

158
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,259
The casings are not metallic.
I'm not even sure they're organic.

159
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:17,931
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there...

160
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:20,442
- if that makes any sense.
- And the bodies?

161
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:23,167
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

162
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:27,981
Provided, of course,
that Dr. Fallada agrees they're dead.

163
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:35,850
I don't know that I am quallfied
to pass judgment on alien death.

164
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,191
You would agree that
they're less allve than we are?

165
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:44,367
Yesterday in Hong Kong,
gold closed lower.

166
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:47,303
In light trading
on European currency markets...

167
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:50,205
the pound closed mixed against
the dollar and West German marks.

168
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:55,537
There will be a full market report
after the late news.

169
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:58,948
This is James Graham
reporting from the city.

170
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:00,951
Now back to the newsroom.

171
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:10,126
Hailey's Comet is now
dominating the northern sky...

172
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:12,664
stretching over 100 million miles
across the heavens...

173
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:15,893
occupying one-sixth
of the entire visible horizon.

174
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,267
On this exceptionally clear night...

175
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:22,001
a group of enthusiasts are commemorating
Dr. Edmund Hailey's great prediction...

176
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:26,011
by holding an outdoor watching from
his original observatory at Greenwich.

177
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,014
Our viewers may be interested
to know...

178
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:31,778
that comets were once considered
to be hargingers of evil.

179
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:34,684
One of the earliest words
for comet was "disaster"...

180
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:37,087
which in Latin means "evil star."

181
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:41,185
It may indeed be an evil star
for the deep space probe Churchill.

182
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,891
There's still no word from Her Majesty's
government as to the fate of the crew...

183
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:46,797
whether they're allve or dead.

184
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,562
We can only await
further developments--

185
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:11,717
Use my body.

186
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:50,249
- Where's the girl?
- She's gone.

187
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:55,360
I saw her.

188
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:01,765
She did that.

189
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,840
- Security.
- Hello. Professor Fallada here.

190
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:10,003
I'm calling
at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

191
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,948
- Get me the duty security captain now.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:15,448
Don't worry.

193
00:24:15,516 --> 00:24:18,885
A naked girl is not going
to get out of this complex.

194
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,429
Four-nine to Control. you'll
never believe what I'm looking at.

195
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,634
- Control, can you say that again?
- I believe you heard me.

196
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,868
There's a girl on the loose
in the building. She must not leave.

197
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,603
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

198
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,544
That's right. That's what I said.
Surely, you can find her.

199
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,549
Must be some kind of joke.

200
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:24,856
Don't believe it.

201
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,554
all right, miss,
just stay where you are.

202
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,597
You heard them.
They said grab her.

203
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:34,724
Take it easy, mate.
She's not in her right mind.

204
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:38,237
Control, we have located the girl
in the main lobby.

205
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,471
That's it. Come on.

206
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,800
- Yes?
- We've located the girl, sir.

207
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,278
- Where?
- She's downstairs in the main lobby.

208
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,144
Right.

209
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:53,550
She's in the main lobby.
You all right to go down there?

210
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:57,054
Nice and easy.

211
00:25:57,125 --> 00:26:00,754
Come on.
Come to me.

212
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,796
Come to Daddy.

213
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:15,433
Make it stop.

214
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:18,070
Come on!
Let's get her!

215
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:06,693
- Are you all right, mate?
- Yeah.

216
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:34,886
all nonmilitary personnel
please clear the area.

217
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:39,295
I repeat: Everybody who has
no business to be here...

218
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,301
please clear the area
for your own safety.

219
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:45,132
This is a police announcement.

220
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:51,941
Sorry, gentlemen,
no photographs, please.

221
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:55,243
It's all right.

222
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:59,550
- Which of you is Dr. Bukovsky?
- I am.

223
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:02,748
- I'm Colonel Caine.
- From the S.A.S.?

224
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:06,817
That last remark is not for publication.
This is a D notice situation.

225
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:22,709
Not too close.

226
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:30,044
And this was murder, you say?

227
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:38,054
Tell me again
how the girl overpowered you.

228
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:41,730
She--

229
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:48,231
It was the most overwhelmingly
feminine presence I've ever encountered.

230
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,734
- I was drawn to her on a level that--
- Was it sexual?

231
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,745
Yes, overwhelmingly so.

232
00:28:56,813 --> 00:29:00,772
And horrible.
Loss of control.

233
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:02,843
The guard was dead
when you came into the room?

234
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,287
- You found him as he is now?
- Yeah.

235
00:29:06,357 --> 00:29:09,588
And the girl came from the ship
Churchill?

236
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,186
Uh-huh.

237
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:14,754
She spoke to you, in English?

238
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:16,356
That's right.

239
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:19,199
How would she know English?

240
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:23,207
Going back, you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire.

241
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:25,208
They weren't destroyed
in the fire.

242
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:27,871
That's what we were told
to tell the public. They were erased.

243
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,379
"Erased"?

244
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:31,712
Also, the Churchill's escape pod
is missing.

245
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:34,412
- Did someone escape?
- We don't know.

246
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:36,546
Unfortunately, the condition
of the bodies...

247
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:39,216
make an accurate count
impossible.

248
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,556
Could the heat from the fire
have launched the pod?

249
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:47,566
What started the fire?

250
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:55,073
The ship's oxygen system ignited.
It was a terribly hot fire.

251
00:29:55,142 --> 00:30:00,011
Yet you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

252
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:02,242
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?

253
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:04,581
In the bay
where the space tug was stored.

254
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:06,744
Where everything else was charred.

255
00:30:08,322 --> 00:30:11,087
Incredible, is it not?

256
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:18,660
- Have you examined the cases?
- Using every technique we have.

257
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,963
X-ray scans of the cases
yield only blurred images.

258
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:25,940
-What does that mean?
-They're not precisely physical objects.

259
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,975
More like a force field.

260
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:32,104
We're a bit out of our depth here.
The whole thing is--

261
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,116
Yes, I know, incredible.

262
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,080
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard? I suppose not.

263
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:41,589
What about your two other bodies?

264
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:46,586
Colonel, may I be excused?

265
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:49,290
I seem to be feeling
a little more nauseous than I thought.

266
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:50,798
Yes, of course.

267
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:02,446
I noticed from your door, Dr. Fallada,
that your area is biochemistry.

268
00:31:03,981 --> 00:31:05,914
But I understand
your real interest is--

269
00:31:05,983 --> 00:31:08,248
Death, Colonel Caine.
Correct.

270
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,252
Thanatology is the name for it.

271
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,755
Death for you
is a bureaucratic problem.

272
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:15,417
Who did it? When?
Why did they do it?

273
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:18,087
- Am I correct?
- And for you?

274
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:21,098
I'm fascinated by death itself:

275
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:24,398
what happens as we die, when we die,
what happens after we die.

276
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,769
- You mean life after death?
- Yes.

277
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:32,277
- ls there life after death?
- Do you really want to know?

278
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:40,744
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

279
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:44,620
If I am correct, the lifeforce
is conserved always...

280
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,659
and in all things,
even after death.

281
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:49,489
You think that applies
to what's happened here tonight?

282
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:52,964
Yes, I do.

283
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:56,469
I think that girl, creature...

284
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:59,232
drained energy, lifeforce...

285
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:03,901
partially from Bukovsky
and totally from the guard.

286
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:07,675
- A vampire?
- lt could be described that way.

287
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:09,739
In a sense, we're all vampires.

288
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:13,378
We drain energy
from other life-forms.

289
00:32:13,454 --> 00:32:16,583
The difference is one of degree.

290
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:19,526
That girl was no girl.

291
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:23,553
She is totally alien to this planet
and our life-form...

292
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:25,725
and totally dangerous.

293
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:04,606
Jesus.

294
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,246
- Do you believe those blokes are allve?
- I'm not paid to believe nothing.

295
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:15,085
I believe they're allve.

296
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:20,483
Don't look bloody dead to me.

297
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:17,349
We've had some trouble,
but everything's under control.

298
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:19,511
I think you better
come down here.

299
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:21,578
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.

300
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:40,998
It would appear these two
are no longer dangerous.

301
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:45,513
There is certainly no possiblity
of doing a full autopsy on them.

302
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:47,515
I would like
to examine the guard.

303
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,314
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

304
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,819
I believe so, sir.

305
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:58,517
This is an autopsy on the body of a
young man, dead approximately two hours.

306
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:00,756
- Did you say he was about twenty?
- Yes, that's correct.

307
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:10,569
Get the Colonel down here!

308
00:37:06,263 --> 00:37:08,731
Put him in an isolation cell,
quickly!

309
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:29,109
I had no idea
it could be passed on.

310
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:31,156
What do you suggest?

311
00:37:31,223 --> 00:37:33,623
I would recommend that you
place this body in another cell.

312
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:36,320
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

313
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:39,455
I won't be at all surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

314
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,465
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:43,467
Also, I want the two other male bodies
that were shot.

316
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:45,469
Collect the pieces
and watch them.

317
00:37:45,537 --> 00:37:48,701
- Get me the Home Secretary now.
- Sir.

318
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:51,437
- Call for the Colonel, sir.
- Sir, you have a call.

319
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,407
I'll be right there.

320
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,612
They've just found a body in Hyde Park.
A naked girl.

321
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:04,213
They say she's
in an indescribable condition.

322
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,225
Could that be your girl?

323
00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:09,890
- Well?
- That's not her.

324
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,898
Inspector,
what about the two boys?

325
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:14,936
They were in the park earlier, sir.

326
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:19,440
We saw her, I think, earlier.

327
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:22,566
Any rate,
that looks like her hair.

328
00:38:22,643 --> 00:38:24,373
- What a mess.
- Was she alone?

329
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:26,471
No, that's why we noticed her.

330
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:29,574
She was with a dark-haired girl,
real good-looking and all.

331
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:31,516
Didn't have a lot
of clothes on either.

332
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:33,519
We thought they might be--
Well, you know.

333
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:36,421
Yes. Did you see where
the dark-haired girl went?

334
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:39,154
No, we didn't.

335
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:41,525
We angled on back
to see if maybe we could...

336
00:38:41,596 --> 00:38:44,759
you know,
see them doing something.

337
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,960
- That's when we found her.
- How long ago was that?

338
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:50,028
- Half an hour ago.
- This lad phoned us, and we called you.

339
00:38:50,106 --> 00:38:52,233
Yes. Thank you, lnspector.

340
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:57,876
Obviously, the work of the girl.

341
00:38:57,948 --> 00:39:00,779
Could we have this body sent back
to the center with the others?

342
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:02,785
Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.

343
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:05,378
Inspector, let me know
if you find anything else.

344
00:39:05,455 --> 00:39:08,049
- we'll be taking her back with us.
- Very good, sir.

345
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,194
Now she has clothes.

346
00:39:14,998 --> 00:39:17,364
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

347
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:31,003
Dr. Hans Fallada, Sir Percy
Hestlestine, the Home Secretary.

348
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:34,074
You're just in time.

349
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,144
It's exactly two hours.

350
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,934
This is the guard who was originally
overcome by the space girl.

351
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,568
As I feared,
once transformed...

352
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:33,272
the victims need regular infusions
of energy...

353
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,839
- otherwise--
- Otherwise what?

354
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:03,909
Oh, my God. Dear God.

355
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:09,909
And we have the pathologist
who was attacked by the guard.

356
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:22,265
- See?
- He, too, needs feeding.

357
00:41:38,783 --> 00:41:42,275
The same thing will happen
to that girl we found in the park...

358
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:43,786
in about one hour.

359
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,870
Good Lord! Goodness!

360
00:43:15,484 --> 00:43:16,918
She's the last?

361
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:19,649
- Have there been any further reports?
- No, sir.

362
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,214
We're set up to get the calls here
the instant one comes in.

363
00:43:22,293 --> 00:43:24,056
- What?
- Nothing.

364
00:43:24,128 --> 00:43:27,757
You say these creatures
were brought back from the Churchill?

365
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,823
Yes, sir, but not this one.
She's a victim of the creatures.

366
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:34,065
Yes, but where did
the Churchill acquire them?

367
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:36,437
We have no way of determining that
at present.

368
00:43:36,508 --> 00:43:38,669
- Perhaps that's all changing.
- What?

369
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:41,506
I've just received a call
from the J.P.L. in Pasadena.

370
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,844
The goldstone tracking disc
has just picked up something...

371
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:48,511
they think is Churchill's escape pod
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

372
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,250
- Where?
- Texas.

373
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:28,650
Where?
Walter Reed Army Hospital?

374
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:32,096
Is he hurt? Just exhausted.

375
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:34,100
Get him the hell over here!

376
00:44:37,271 --> 00:44:39,240
Colonel Carlsen?
They're expecting you, sir.

377
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:43,176
Colonel Carlsen, sir.

378
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:45,845
Tom.

379
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:52,385
I thought you were dead.

380
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:57,992
allow me to introduce Colonel Caine
of the Special Air Services.

381
00:44:58,061 --> 00:44:59,493
How do you do?

382
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,029
- You already know Dr. Fallada.
- Colonel.

383
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,233
Take a seat.

384
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,773
I'm sorry to drag you over here
like this.

385
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,901
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

386
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:20,172
We've got to know what happened
on the Churchill.

387
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,808
Yes, of course.

388
00:45:25,187 --> 00:45:28,521
It may be very difficult
for you...

389
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:31,186
to accept what
I'm going to say.

390
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:34,356
we'll have very little difficulty
believing anything you have to tell us.

391
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:37,732
- Do go on.
- You know something?

392
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:40,828
There was a fire
aboard the Churchill.

393
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,636
You might be interested to know that
the bodies of the three humanoids...

394
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,676
were not destroyed in that fire.

395
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,211
They survived in their cases.

396
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:51,511
They were brought down here to London,
and the female has escaped.

397
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,517
She's killed three people already.

398
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,476
Oh, my God.

399
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,685
So whatever you have to tell us
is rather pressing.

400
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:03,729
Please, tell us what happened.

401
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:09,092
We found the bodies
aboard the alien spacecraft.

402
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,567
What alien spacecraft?

403
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,834
Colonel,
take it from the beginning.

404
00:46:15,908 --> 00:46:20,107
Assume we know nothing,
which is understating the matter.

405
00:46:22,048 --> 00:46:25,314
We approached within 9,000 miles
of Hailey's Comet...

406
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:31,455
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

407
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:36,463
After we discovered the bodies,
we transferred them to the Churchill.

408
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,558
We have the three humanoid creatures
and one of the bat-like things.

409
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:43,762
This is Churchill.
We copy. Welcome back.

410
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:45,773
Have you gotten through
to Earth yet, Rawlings?

411
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:49,139
No, sir, and the tall
of the comet's heating up.

412
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:57,382
- What's the matter, Derebridge?
- I don't know, Tom.

413
00:46:57,452 --> 00:46:59,216
I feel drained.

414
00:46:59,288 --> 00:47:00,755
Do you?

415
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,151
I feel invigorated.
You okay?

416
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:09,956
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Okay.

417
00:47:13,203 --> 00:47:15,762
Everybody back
to their stations.

418
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:19,008
Let's get the hell out of here.

419
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:26,845
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die...

420
00:47:26,918 --> 00:47:28,850
one by one.

421
00:47:34,057 --> 00:47:35,581
Rawlings...

422
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,651
the radio officer,
was the first to go.

423
00:47:49,574 --> 00:47:52,169
Rawlings denied any knowledge
of what he had done.

424
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,302
I don't remember.

425
00:47:58,217 --> 00:48:01,709
Besides myself, you're the only one
who has been up here in the last hour.

426
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:05,750
I've been feeling weak recently...

427
00:48:05,825 --> 00:48:08,258
not myself.

428
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:11,320
Just don't remember.

429
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,246
We found Rawlings' body
the next day.

430
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,693
exactly how...

431
00:48:40,761 --> 00:48:43,060
did he die, Colonel?

432
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:46,099
The life just drained out of him.

433
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:52,839
One by one...

434
00:48:55,944 --> 00:48:57,969
the rest of the crew
began to die.

435
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:03,118
Somehow...

436
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,554
I don't know how...

437
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:11,919
I held out.

438
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:18,492
It just seemed
to be a matter of will.

439
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:22,138
I always thought--

440
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:27,976
The girl--

441
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:32,578
Yes? The girl?

442
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:40,755
I can't remember.

443
00:49:53,905 --> 00:49:56,170
What I remember next...

444
00:49:56,241 --> 00:49:59,437
is the view
out of the observation window...

445
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,810
coming into Earth's orbit.

446
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:06,881
I couldn't expose the world
to what we'd brought back with us.

447
00:51:27,604 --> 00:51:29,934
I was determined
to destroy them all.

448
00:51:57,068 --> 00:51:59,832
It was the hardest thing I ever did.

449
00:51:59,904 --> 00:52:02,135
We understand.

450
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:04,141
It must have taken great courage
to try and make--

451
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:06,144
No, you don't understand.

452
00:52:07,345 --> 00:52:10,543
Part of me didn't want to leave.

453
00:52:10,616 --> 00:52:13,642
She killed all my friends,
and I still didn't want to leave.

454
00:52:14,886 --> 00:52:17,082
Leaving her was the hardest thing
I ever did.

455
00:52:21,393 --> 00:52:24,157
Colonel Carlsen looks exhausted to me.

456
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:27,563
We should allow him to get some sleep,
continue with this later.

457
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:29,065
Very well.

458
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:32,737
Thank you, Colonel.

459
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:02,861
NASA tracking and ours...

460
00:53:02,938 --> 00:53:06,737
have just reported an unusual structure
leaving Hailey's Comet.

461
00:53:06,807 --> 00:53:08,240
It's headed for us.

462
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,777
What is it?

463
00:53:10,913 --> 00:53:12,504
Radar ranging reports the object...

464
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:16,517
is a needlelike shape,
150 miles long.

465
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:19,053
Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit...

466
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:22,056
in a little more than two days.

467
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:25,060
I've just received a call
from the Prime Minister.

468
00:53:26,361 --> 00:53:28,557
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

469
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:30,259
Prime Minister wants answers.

470
00:53:56,962 --> 00:53:58,895
Close your eyes.

471
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:09,006
You're giving me your life.

472
00:54:18,751 --> 00:54:20,378
You're taking it.

473
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:28,687
You're draining me.

474
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,692
You're taking too much of me.

475
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,583
It was just a dream.

476
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:04,492
- What dream?
- The girl-- She visited me.

477
00:56:04,562 --> 00:56:06,656
Visited you? How?

478
00:56:06,732 --> 00:56:08,165
In my mind.

479
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,568
She has some kind
of mental contact with me.

480
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:18,199
She's draining me.

481
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:20,211
Tell us about the dream.

482
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:24,042
I can't. It's gone.

483
00:56:24,116 --> 00:56:25,948
It's faded.

484
00:56:26,018 --> 00:56:27,451
I can't remember.

485
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,147
Have you ever been hypnotized?

486
00:56:31,324 --> 00:56:33,588
Do you mind if I try?

487
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:36,593
Yeah, let's try it.

488
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:41,793
- Not now. He's too exhausted.
- Fine. ln the morning.

489
00:56:41,868 --> 00:56:45,896
Just stare at it until your eyes
feel tired, then close them.

490
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:51,104
You'll feel very tired,
very sleepy.

491
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:57,014
She seems to speak to me
in my dreams.

492
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:00,853
She--

493
00:57:02,222 --> 00:57:03,690
The girl--

494
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:05,192
I feeI--

495
00:57:06,226 --> 00:57:09,685
What do you feel for her?

496
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:12,426
I feel very...

497
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,297
close to her.

498
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:17,463
Is she in touch with you?

499
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:20,030
I feel...

500
00:57:20,108 --> 00:57:22,703
as if my mind...

501
00:57:22,778 --> 00:57:25,372
is not entirely my own.

502
00:57:25,448 --> 00:57:28,975
If she is in contact
with your mind...

503
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:31,746
perhaps you are in contact
with hers.

504
00:57:31,821 --> 00:57:33,345
Can you see her?

505
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:36,084
Can you see where she is?

506
00:57:37,056 --> 00:57:38,489
Yes.

507
00:57:38,558 --> 00:57:40,582
Where is she now?

508
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:44,096
A place.
I don't know the name of it.

509
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:45,755
She's walking.

510
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:49,760
She has a different face...

511
00:57:49,836 --> 00:57:51,429
but it's her.

512
00:57:51,505 --> 00:57:53,769
"A different face"?
How can that be?

513
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:56,777
She's using a different body.

514
00:57:56,844 --> 00:57:59,937
- What is she doing?
- She's looking for a man.

515
00:58:00,013 --> 00:58:01,845
What man?

516
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:05,442
Any man.
A healthy man.

517
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,613
Does she intend to kill him?

518
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:11,284
- Why not?
- She's afraid of being caught.

519
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:14,623
- How could she be caught?
- The body would give her away.

520
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:16,790
What is she hoping to do?

521
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:19,458
She wants to...

522
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:22,298
draw some energy from him.

523
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,962
Not enough to kill him.

524
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:27,475
- She can do that?
- Yes.

525
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:30,340
There's another mind.

526
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:32,471
Yes.

527
00:58:32,547 --> 00:58:34,276
The girl's name...

528
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:35,977
is Ellen.

529
00:58:36,052 --> 00:58:37,986
There are two people
in one body?

530
00:58:38,054 --> 00:58:40,545
Two minds?

531
00:58:40,623 --> 00:58:43,352
Ellen and the vampire?

532
00:58:43,426 --> 00:58:44,859
Yes.

533
00:58:47,496 --> 00:58:50,091
She's watching a man.

534
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:51,929
What is the man doing?

535
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:56,598
He's parked,
doing something with his car.

536
00:58:58,407 --> 00:59:00,603
Get the license number.

537
00:59:00,677 --> 00:59:04,114
Can you see the license number
of his car?

538
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:05,614
Yes.

539
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:08,352
Read it out.

540
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,614
FMC...

541
00:59:12,288 --> 00:59:15,225
129E...

542
00:59:15,293 --> 00:59:18,023
or R.

543
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,963
What is the make of the car?

544
00:59:22,868 --> 00:59:25,301
A white Volvo.

545
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,838
What is she doing now?

546
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:33,770
They're driving now.

547
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:36,746
Does she ask him his name?

548
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:41,753
She's pulling her skirt...

549
00:59:43,156 --> 00:59:44,917
over her knees.

550
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:47,426
She's--

551
00:59:48,494 --> 00:59:49,927
He's...

552
00:59:51,331 --> 00:59:53,265
putting his...

553
00:59:55,835 --> 01:00:00,101
hand on her leg.

554
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:18,790
FMC129E or possibly R...

555
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:20,952
belonging to a white Volvo.

556
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:23,792
The driver of the car
picked up a girl named Ellen.

557
01:00:23,864 --> 01:00:26,800
I have to know who the girl is
and where we can find her.

558
01:00:26,868 --> 01:00:28,960
She's connected with the case.

559
01:00:29,036 --> 01:00:32,131
I can't explain over an open line.
Thank you.

560
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:35,973
Do you think he's telling the truth
about the girl?

561
01:00:36,045 --> 01:00:37,978
we'll soon see.

562
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:42,415
How brilliant, if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind...

563
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:46,081
taking only a small amount
of energy from each victim.

564
01:00:46,156 --> 01:00:49,090
It would make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

565
01:00:49,158 --> 01:00:51,126
She's hoping to leave no trail.

566
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:55,598
If the girl is no longer in her
original body, where is her body?

567
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:59,762
- Hidden.
- Let's find it.

568
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:03,267
Supposing you're right
about all of this.

569
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,832
What about that ship up there?
What's it doing?

570
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:11,142
We can't know that,
but we've got to assume the worst.

571
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:13,275
Maybe they're like
the vampires of legend.

572
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:15,284
How's that?

573
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:19,119
They would carry their Earth
with them, in their coffins.

574
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:21,180
Wouldn't they?

575
01:01:23,528 --> 01:01:26,622
- We have the feed from Hawall.
- Here it comes.

576
01:01:26,698 --> 01:01:32,534
- Put it on screen number one.
- Coming in 240,000 miles.

577
01:01:34,138 --> 01:01:37,267
My God, it's immense.

578
01:01:56,663 --> 01:02:00,758
Hugh, do you have that skin tissue
sample I asked for?

579
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,597
Good.

580
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:05,604
Of course, I'll follow
containment procedure.

581
01:02:05,672 --> 01:02:07,105
He's here now.

582
01:02:07,174 --> 01:02:09,607
Send in that soldier, please.

583
01:02:13,014 --> 01:02:14,447
Thank you.

584
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:52,747
One moment, Sergeant.
Thank you for coming.

585
01:02:52,822 --> 01:02:55,086
I'll be with you shortly.

586
01:03:05,168 --> 01:03:07,602
bloody awful job, chasing that car.

587
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,765
It belongs to a man named
Ned Price who lives in Yorkshire.

588
01:03:10,841 --> 01:03:13,776
- We have him under detention now.
- What about the girl?

589
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:17,280
The girl he picked up
was a nurse named Ellen, as you said.

590
01:03:17,348 --> 01:03:19,941
Ellen something.
He doesn't know her other name.

591
01:03:20,017 --> 01:03:24,114
He dropped her at Thurlstone Hospital
after spending the afternoon with her.

592
01:03:24,189 --> 01:03:28,626
He was reluctant to talk about it.
The man's totally exhausted.

593
01:03:28,693 --> 01:03:31,957
Isn't Thurlstone an asylum
of some sort?

594
01:03:32,029 --> 01:03:35,090
Yes, for the criminally insane.

595
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:01,927
How do you do? I'm Dr. Armstrong,
director of the hospital.

596
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:03,928
Come with me to my office.

597
01:04:08,502 --> 01:04:11,266
- It's a cold night.
- Bitterly cold.

598
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:15,104
This is the nurses' house.

599
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:17,939
Ellen Donaldson is number five.

600
01:04:18,012 --> 01:04:19,603
Thank you.

601
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:22,113
Shouldn't I come up
and introduce you?

602
01:04:22,183 --> 01:04:24,116
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Come along, Dr. Armstrong.

603
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:26,619
You and I have several matters
to discuss.

604
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:33,622
Yes? Who is it?

605
01:04:33,694 --> 01:04:36,720
My name's Colin Caine.
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

606
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:39,734
I'd like to talk to you.
May I come in?

607
01:04:49,145 --> 01:04:50,578
Yes?

608
01:04:52,481 --> 01:04:54,916
- What do you want?
- My name is Colin Caine.

609
01:04:54,984 --> 01:04:57,918
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.

610
01:04:57,986 --> 01:05:02,423
May we come in and talk to you?
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

611
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:13,436
May I sit down?

612
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:20,341
I want to ask about the man you spent
the afternoon with, Ned Price.

613
01:05:23,013 --> 01:05:25,846
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I think you do.

614
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:29,010
- Let me see your hand.
- Beg your pardon?

615
01:05:33,492 --> 01:05:35,482
You're in there, aren't you?

616
01:05:37,762 --> 01:05:40,322
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

617
01:05:46,637 --> 01:05:48,572
It's gone from her.
It's in another body now.

618
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:52,407
- How do you know that?
- I can see it, in her mind.

619
01:05:54,113 --> 01:05:57,913
She's resisting.
I'll have to force her to tell me.

620
01:05:57,984 --> 01:06:01,920
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

621
01:06:01,988 --> 01:06:03,455
An extreme masochist.

622
01:06:03,523 --> 01:06:05,924
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

623
01:06:05,993 --> 01:06:08,757
She wants me to hurt her.

624
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:13,493
I can see the images in her mind.
Do you want to stay?

625
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:17,664
- Otherwise, wait outside!
- Not at all. I am a natural voyeur.

626
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:24,477
Are you in there?

627
01:06:33,354 --> 01:06:34,845
Are you there?

628
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,194
Let go.

629
01:06:42,462 --> 01:06:43,987
Now.

630
01:07:36,687 --> 01:07:38,120
Well?

631
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:40,282
I've got a physical description.

632
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:49,966
You better send someone
to look after Nurse Donaldson.

633
01:07:50,036 --> 01:07:51,468
Is she all right?

634
01:07:51,536 --> 01:07:54,026
If I described one of the inmates
to you, could you identify him?

635
01:07:54,105 --> 01:07:55,573
Possibly.

636
01:07:55,641 --> 01:07:59,873
Big man, fat, gray hair,
birthmark on his face.

637
01:07:59,944 --> 01:08:03,939
Jeffrey Sykes, the child murderer.
Where did you get his description?

638
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:08,477
- Where is he now?
- He's in solitary confinement.

639
01:08:08,554 --> 01:08:10,181
He's been naughty.

640
01:08:10,256 --> 01:08:13,157
- What is this about?
- What we're looking for has moved.

641
01:08:13,226 --> 01:08:16,321
- We could be here some time.
- I better call London.

642
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:19,161
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.

643
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:22,670
- We have to see Sykes now.
- Couldn't this wait until the morning?

644
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:26,164
all right, I'll arrange it.

645
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,505
Anything to oblige, Commander.

646
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:37,108
I wish this were not so mysterious.

647
01:08:37,185 --> 01:08:40,621
If the police are involved,
haven't I a right to know?

648
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:43,783
If you're going to start
messing about with my patients--

649
01:08:46,328 --> 01:08:49,125
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

650
01:08:49,197 --> 01:08:53,292
However, I can tell you
it is a matter of national security.

651
01:08:53,368 --> 01:08:54,802
I see.

652
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,963
But don't you think
that I should be present...

653
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:00,133
to represent the interests
of my patient?

654
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:01,971
- You see--
- Can I talk to you for a second?

655
01:09:02,043 --> 01:09:03,476
Of course.

656
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,310
The man has the I.Q.
of a child of four.

657
01:09:07,383 --> 01:09:10,978
That's a decision I shall have
to defer to Colonel Caine.

658
01:09:11,053 --> 01:09:14,319
Yes, of course, you can come along.
Can we start now?

659
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:18,384
- What are you going to do to him?
- I'd like to hypnotize him.

660
01:09:22,231 --> 01:09:23,824
What's that?

661
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,834
Pentothal and morphine.

662
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:29,668
Recommended for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

663
01:09:40,685 --> 01:09:44,451
Well, he seems quiet.

664
01:09:44,522 --> 01:09:46,787
- We're ready when you are.
- Lamson.

665
01:09:46,858 --> 01:09:48,291
Sir.

666
01:10:11,551 --> 01:10:13,643
Can the injection be dangerous?

667
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:15,915
He should have no difficulty
tolerating it.

668
01:10:15,989 --> 01:10:18,048
There's always a risk, sir.

669
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:20,092
May I have that?

670
01:10:21,961 --> 01:10:23,825
I'll wake him up.

671
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:28,498
- What are you doing?
- Stay where you are.

672
01:10:28,568 --> 01:10:31,834
He's sick, Lamson.
Help us. I can't explain now.

673
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:36,609
There's our killer, Sir Percy.

674
01:11:06,209 --> 01:11:08,542
It's madness.

675
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:12,111
I want to question him.
Where can we take him?

676
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:13,649
Up the ramp, sir.

677
01:11:32,904 --> 01:11:34,996
We need to be alone.

678
01:11:43,681 --> 01:11:45,672
How did you know it was him?

679
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:50,119
In the nurses' quarters,
he touched me on the shoulder.

680
01:11:50,188 --> 01:11:51,884
I saw into his mind.

681
01:11:53,024 --> 01:11:54,456
What?

682
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:57,962
The Colonel is able to see
into the minds of people...

683
01:11:58,029 --> 01:12:01,864
who have been possessed
by the girl creature, sir.

684
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:07,066
It happens when I touch them.
Let's get him on the table.

685
01:12:15,883 --> 01:12:17,315
How--

686
01:12:18,552 --> 01:12:20,816
How do you know
she's still inside Armstrong?

687
01:12:20,887 --> 01:12:22,946
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone else?

688
01:12:23,024 --> 01:12:24,649
She's trapped.

689
01:12:25,892 --> 01:12:27,688
I can feel that.

690
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:29,319
Are you sure?

691
01:12:36,404 --> 01:12:38,462
- Lamson.
- Sir?

692
01:12:38,538 --> 01:12:43,738
- Bring me another dose of the drug.
- One dose is usually enough.

693
01:12:43,811 --> 01:12:47,372
This is not a usual situation.
How long does this stuff last?

694
01:12:47,448 --> 01:12:50,475
A dose like that?
A couple of hours.

695
01:12:50,552 --> 01:12:53,610
we'll definitely need more.

696
01:12:53,687 --> 01:12:56,351
- Bring me three doses.
- Three?

697
01:12:56,425 --> 01:13:00,384
I'll take responsibility.
Just get on with it.

698
01:13:00,462 --> 01:13:02,293
Yes, sir.

699
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,792
Is a second dose safe?

700
01:13:05,867 --> 01:13:07,960
Surely it can strain his heart.

701
01:13:08,036 --> 01:13:13,132
Look, you don't know
what we're deallng with here.

702
01:13:13,207 --> 01:13:17,645
If he slips out from under,
she'll escape.

703
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,164
Can you hear me?

704
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:40,937
If you can hear me,
just say yes.

705
01:13:46,143 --> 01:13:49,443
It won't let me...

706
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:53,116
talk to you.

707
01:14:15,207 --> 01:14:17,472
Can you see
what's holding you prisoner?

708
01:14:21,048 --> 01:14:23,983
Yes. She--

709
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:27,145
Tell her she has to talk to me!

710
01:14:28,221 --> 01:14:29,653
Yes?

711
01:14:32,059 --> 01:14:34,322
I brought the Pentothal.

712
01:14:34,393 --> 01:14:36,260
Thanks. That will be all.

713
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,104
Hold him.

714
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,170
There's no need for that.

715
01:15:13,168 --> 01:15:17,104
You in there?
Can you still hear me?

716
01:15:19,543 --> 01:15:22,409
Can you get into his mind,
her mind?

717
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:24,208
Not with this drug.
It's like a wall.

718
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,976
Perhaps you've given him too much.

719
01:15:27,049 --> 01:15:28,517
Shut up!

720
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:36,153
Listen, you bitch...

721
01:15:36,226 --> 01:15:39,196
I'll keep you in this state
for weeks if I have to.

722
01:15:39,263 --> 01:15:40,889
Now, you talk to me.

723
01:15:40,964 --> 01:15:42,899
Carlsen, be with me.

724
01:15:44,168 --> 01:15:47,365
- What do you want from me?
- I love you.

725
01:15:51,308 --> 01:15:53,105
What are you?

726
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:56,773
Why are you so human, so perfect?

727
01:15:57,883 --> 01:15:59,851
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

728
01:15:59,918 --> 01:16:02,785
Our bodies are unimportant.

729
01:16:02,854 --> 01:16:06,813
As you and your men approached
in your ship...

730
01:16:06,892 --> 01:16:09,292
we changed them for you.

731
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,023
We entered your minds...

732
01:16:12,097 --> 01:16:14,793
and found there new bodies.

733
01:16:14,866 --> 01:16:17,427
I took my shape from your mind.

734
01:16:18,503 --> 01:16:21,495
I took your language.

735
01:16:21,573 --> 01:16:24,304
I became the woman I found there...

736
01:16:24,377 --> 01:16:28,780
in your deepest thoughts,
your deepest needs.

737
01:16:30,049 --> 01:16:33,382
I am the feminine in your mind.

738
01:16:39,326 --> 01:16:41,920
Where are you?

739
01:16:41,995 --> 01:16:43,428
Where's your body?

740
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:46,758
Let me go!

741
01:16:53,808 --> 01:16:55,571
Touch me, Carlsen.

742
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:34,713
- It's already spreading.
- How?

743
01:18:34,781 --> 01:18:36,806
- You didn't stop it. It's too late.
- That's impossible.

744
01:18:36,883 --> 01:18:38,816
We've only been half a step
behind her all the way.

745
01:18:38,884 --> 01:18:40,821
This gentleman stopped breathing.

746
01:18:42,256 --> 01:18:44,189
There's no pulse either.

747
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:56,002
I think his neck is broken.

748
01:19:00,075 --> 01:19:03,510
Prepare a stretcher for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

749
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:05,842
Prepare all your remaining doses
of the drug for travel.

750
01:19:05,914 --> 01:19:07,347
Yes, sir.

751
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:18,024
You said the thing hadn't stopped,
it was still spreading.

752
01:19:18,093 --> 01:19:21,359
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

753
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:24,866
Could the girl have been deliberately
leading us away from London?

754
01:19:24,934 --> 01:19:27,095
Did we find all of her victims?

755
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:31,340
If there are others
besides the girl in the park--

756
01:19:31,407 --> 01:19:34,309
- The thing would spread.
- ln a chain reaction...

757
01:19:34,378 --> 01:19:36,642
geometrically,
until, by now--

758
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:39,781
Christ.

759
01:20:13,252 --> 01:20:17,018
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to reach the S.R.C. in London?

760
01:20:17,089 --> 01:20:20,525
Just a moment, sir.
There's something coming through.

761
01:20:20,592 --> 01:20:22,958
It is the S.R.C.
for you and Carlsen.

762
01:20:26,266 --> 01:20:27,698
Go ahead.

763
01:20:27,766 --> 01:20:30,702
Can you hear me?

764
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:33,863
Fallada, speak up!
I can't hear you!

765
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,967
The two males didn't die.

766
01:20:38,045 --> 01:20:40,638
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soldiers who shot them...

767
01:20:40,713 --> 01:20:44,149
and transformed the soldiers' bodies
into their own likenesses.

768
01:20:44,217 --> 01:20:46,152
That's the difference
between them and their victims.

769
01:20:46,219 --> 01:20:50,589
Their victims can't leave their bodies.
Only the original three can do that.

770
01:20:50,658 --> 01:20:53,820
- But I've killed one of them.
- One of which?

771
01:20:53,893 --> 01:20:56,158
One of the two male vampires.

772
01:20:56,230 --> 01:21:00,792
- One of the transformed ones.
- How did you kill him?

773
01:21:00,868 --> 01:21:02,995
The old way, Carlsen.

774
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:07,166
A leaded metal shaft
penetrating not through the heart...

775
01:21:07,241 --> 01:21:11,338
but through the energy center
two inches below the heart.

776
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:14,507
Not steel, but leaded iron.

777
01:21:14,582 --> 01:21:16,346
Right, Carlsen?

778
01:21:17,586 --> 01:21:21,022
- Are you there?
- Yes.

779
01:21:21,088 --> 01:21:24,150
Carlsen, and you, too, Caine...

780
01:21:24,228 --> 01:21:26,160
it is my belief...

781
01:21:26,228 --> 01:21:30,859
that the vampires of legend
came from creatures such as these.

782
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:34,163
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

783
01:21:34,236 --> 01:21:36,798
I know it sounds incredible.

784
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:40,336
Do you hear me?

785
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:44,779
It's more than a belief.
It's true.

786
01:21:46,015 --> 01:21:47,677
They visited Earth before.

787
01:21:49,721 --> 01:21:53,053
- What about the other male?
- He's free.

788
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:56,655
- You have the girl?
- Yes.

789
01:21:56,727 --> 01:22:00,390
- we'll be there soon. Hold on.
- we'll try.

790
01:22:03,634 --> 01:22:05,966
- This came while you were talking.
- What is it?

791
01:22:06,036 --> 01:22:09,838
A scrambled cryptograph to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

792
01:22:09,909 --> 01:22:12,844
We're to proceed directly
to the citadel at Whitehall.

793
01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:56,182
Lieutenant, the controls!

794
01:23:10,304 --> 01:23:12,295
We've lost her.
She's gone!

795
01:23:12,372 --> 01:23:16,333
- Where?
- Her body's in London.

796
01:23:16,411 --> 01:23:18,343
Where in London?

797
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:24,451
You've got to tell me
what really happened on the Churchill.

798
01:23:26,922 --> 01:23:30,016
It wasn't Rawlings
who destroyed the radio equipment...

799
01:23:30,092 --> 01:23:31,855
and the ship's tapes.

800
01:23:32,928 --> 01:23:35,159
- lt was me.
- Why?

801
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:38,792
I didn't want the Churchill
to be able to reach Earth.

802
01:23:38,868 --> 01:23:41,461
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

803
01:23:41,536 --> 01:23:42,970
What did happen?

804
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:48,137
I opened her sealed
animation case.

805
01:23:48,212 --> 01:23:52,979
Either I did it
or she did it.

806
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:55,484
I couldn't help myself.

807
01:23:55,552 --> 01:23:57,645
I've never experienced such--

808
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:02,821
I was in love on a level
you've never known.

809
01:24:08,566 --> 01:24:11,329
It terrifies me.

810
01:24:11,402 --> 01:24:13,996
My memory plays tricks on me.

811
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:19,343
She was calling me.

812
01:24:20,411 --> 01:24:24,177
Her power was spiritual.

813
01:24:55,049 --> 01:24:56,982
She wanted me, Caine.

814
01:25:01,556 --> 01:25:03,215
It was more than spiritual.

815
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:19,138
She took some of my energy.

816
01:25:21,777 --> 01:25:24,507
And she gave me
some of her energy.

817
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:36,023
They must have been living
off of each other when we found them.

818
01:25:36,091 --> 01:25:38,685
There were only three of them left.

819
01:25:40,362 --> 01:25:44,767
She killed all of my men,
one by one.

820
01:25:46,535 --> 01:25:48,436
But I survived.

821
01:25:49,539 --> 01:25:53,270
She wanted me to survive.
She chose me!

822
01:25:54,878 --> 01:25:56,311
Why?

823
01:25:57,481 --> 01:26:00,643
She's not human.
She's not a woman.

824
01:26:00,717 --> 01:26:02,652
She'll destroy you.

825
01:26:04,555 --> 01:26:07,149
She's destroyed worlds.

826
01:26:07,224 --> 01:26:09,158
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

827
01:26:09,226 --> 01:26:11,787
A special bulletin
from the BBC.

828
01:26:13,063 --> 01:26:14,997
Tonight London is on the brink...

829
01:26:15,065 --> 01:26:17,159
of the worst devastation
since the blitz.

830
01:26:17,235 --> 01:26:22,502
I can see large areas of the city
burning out of control.

831
01:26:22,574 --> 01:26:25,168
Thousands of people are now rampaging
through the streets...

832
01:26:25,243 --> 01:26:29,180
in a frenzied last effort
to avoid the plague.

833
01:26:29,247 --> 01:26:31,842
Martial law has been enforced now
for three hours...

834
01:26:31,918 --> 01:26:34,477
but it hasn't stemmed
what is obviously--

835
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,976
- Yes, we've been expecting you.
- Thank you. Carry on.

836
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:33,639
- Hurry over, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.

837
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:36,013
- Go around the other side.
- Right.

838
01:27:44,827 --> 01:27:46,852
Is everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?

839
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:50,024
- Yes, everything.
- Please take a seat, gentlemen.

840
01:27:54,004 --> 01:27:59,374
Sir, I have Colonel Caine
and Colonel Carlsen here for you.

841
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:01,070
Very good.

842
01:28:01,144 --> 01:28:05,011
The Prime Minister will see you shortly.
Would you care for tea while you wait?

843
01:28:05,081 --> 01:28:09,348
- Our business is rather urgent.
- The Prime Minister understands that.

844
01:28:10,454 --> 01:28:11,887
- Gentlemen.
- Prime Minister.

845
01:28:11,956 --> 01:28:13,548
I'm Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service...

846
01:28:13,624 --> 01:28:16,387
and I'm sure you've heard
of Colonel Carlsen of the Churchill.

847
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,893
Yes, indeed.

848
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:20,625
Gentlemen, I look forward
to hearing your report.

849
01:28:20,698 --> 01:28:22,690
By the way,
where is Sir Percy?

850
01:28:22,768 --> 01:28:24,291
Dead, I'm afraid.

851
01:28:24,368 --> 01:28:26,234
Oh, that's a great pity.

852
01:28:26,305 --> 01:28:30,536
Sir, we have information
regarding the object in space...

853
01:28:30,609 --> 01:28:33,237
- which is bearing down on the Earth--
- Yes, gentlemen.

854
01:28:33,312 --> 01:28:36,076
If you'll excuse me
just for a moment.

855
01:28:36,148 --> 01:28:38,673
Miss Haversham,
please come this way.

856
01:28:40,252 --> 01:28:41,845
Here, for a moment.

857
01:28:41,921 --> 01:28:43,854
I'll be back, gentlemen.

858
01:29:00,007 --> 01:29:01,440
Please.

859
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:12,885
Somebody get the doctor immediately.

860
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,589
We need a doctor over here.

861
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,437
Go!

862
01:30:02,738 --> 01:30:05,970
- Do you have any weapons aboard?
- No, sir!

863
01:30:06,043 --> 01:30:08,342
- There is a flare pistol, sir.
- Where is it?

864
01:30:08,413 --> 01:30:10,573
Close the breach
and it's ready to fire!

865
01:30:10,648 --> 01:30:12,239
Get him!

866
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:21,716
While you were with the Prime Minister,
I had a call from base operations.

867
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:25,058
The city is now under martial law.
We've been placed under NATO command.

868
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:26,563
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.

869
01:30:26,631 --> 01:30:29,896
My unit's been mobilized
to a staging area at Blackheath.

870
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,766
Land at the S.R.C.
We've got to talk to Fallada.

871
01:30:32,838 --> 01:30:36,673
I'm to land at Blackheath.
The city's under air quarantine.

872
01:30:36,742 --> 01:30:38,767
If we don't do as they say,
they'll shoot us down.

873
01:30:44,949 --> 01:30:48,181
Zero, this is X-ray 318 requesting
clearance to land. Over.

874
01:30:48,253 --> 01:30:51,347
Zero, roger.
X-ray 318, you are clear to land.

875
01:31:01,134 --> 01:31:04,696
Come away from the aircraft!
You are under quarantine!

876
01:31:06,606 --> 01:31:07,800
Over here, please, sir.

877
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:11,705
Don't come any closer!
Stop there!

878
01:31:11,779 --> 01:31:13,938
I want to talk
to your commanding officer.

879
01:31:14,013 --> 01:31:16,039
I am Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service...

880
01:31:16,117 --> 01:31:20,747
and this man is Colonel Tom Carlsen,
United States Air Force...

881
01:31:20,821 --> 01:31:22,516
and former commander
of the Churchill.

882
01:31:26,794 --> 01:31:29,730
Is Dr. Hans Fallada here
from the S.R.C.?

883
01:31:29,798 --> 01:31:33,564
- He knows who we are.
- No, not that I know of.

884
01:31:33,635 --> 01:31:35,796
Has anybody heard of him?

885
01:31:35,871 --> 01:31:37,839
He must still be in London.

886
01:31:37,906 --> 01:31:40,101
Colonel, what exactly do you know
about what's happening there?

887
01:31:40,175 --> 01:31:45,670
all we know for certain is that
a terrible plague is sweeping London.

888
01:31:45,747 --> 01:31:48,581
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

889
01:31:48,651 --> 01:31:53,145
Until that time has elapsed,
I cannot release you from this compound.

890
01:31:53,222 --> 01:31:56,452
We know what the plague is.
We are not infected.

891
01:31:56,525 --> 01:31:59,859
I know what I'm talking about!
We're wasting valuable time!

892
01:32:01,164 --> 01:32:02,859
We have totally isolated London...

893
01:32:02,932 --> 01:32:05,527
in order to stop further contagion.

894
01:32:05,602 --> 01:32:09,038
If that falls, and the surrounding
areas are threatened...

895
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,300
Yes?

896
01:32:11,374 --> 01:32:14,902
sterilization by thermonuclear device
has been approved.

897
01:32:16,613 --> 01:32:19,480
We have this from General Ames
in Brussels.

898
01:32:19,549 --> 01:32:24,681
He's coming up with that decision
in just under three hours.

899
01:32:24,755 --> 01:32:27,384
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

900
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:30,359
- "The ship"?
- The thing from Hailey's Comet.

901
01:32:33,297 --> 01:32:36,927
It's parked itself in a geostationary
orbit directly over London.

902
01:32:55,956 --> 01:33:01,861
all those little blue lights going up
toward the clouds are human souls.

903
01:33:03,095 --> 01:33:06,224
- How do you know that?
- I feel it.

904
01:33:06,299 --> 01:33:10,998
The process of conversion releases
a life energy that can be collected.

905
01:33:11,071 --> 01:33:12,538
"Collected"?

906
01:33:13,774 --> 01:33:17,766
Is that what the umbrella is?
A collector?

907
01:33:17,844 --> 01:33:21,679
The energy doesn't go free.
It goes up there.

908
01:33:42,904 --> 01:33:45,965
The male vampire is collecting
life energy...

909
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:50,501
but he has to send it through her
to get it up to the collector.

910
01:33:52,247 --> 01:33:54,182
Where is she?

911
01:33:55,851 --> 01:33:57,283
Over there.

912
01:33:58,755 --> 01:34:01,519
I get flashes
coming from her body.

913
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:05,858
It's sensitive to its environment.
It picks up things.

914
01:34:05,929 --> 01:34:09,366
- Can you find her?
- lf I can get across to the city.

915
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,034
What about the male?

916
01:34:12,102 --> 01:34:14,865
He'll come if he senses I found her.

917
01:34:14,938 --> 01:34:18,033
She's drawing me.

918
01:34:18,108 --> 01:34:19,870
I've got to go.

919
01:34:21,377 --> 01:34:22,867
Why?

920
01:34:22,947 --> 01:34:25,883
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

921
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:31,980
When they take on a new life-form...

922
01:34:32,057 --> 01:34:35,219
they have to learn
from that life-form.

923
01:34:35,292 --> 01:34:37,158
Mate with it, in a sense.

924
01:34:39,564 --> 01:34:41,498
The girl chose me.

925
01:34:43,401 --> 01:34:46,997
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herself.

926
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:51,835
Now she wants that part back.

927
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:56,011
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector? Over.

928
01:34:56,082 --> 01:34:59,677
- No, sir.
- Okay, keep me posted. Over.

929
01:34:59,752 --> 01:35:03,188
Colonel, listen to me. Carlsen
believes he can locate the source.

930
01:35:03,255 --> 01:35:05,020
There are only two carriers.

931
01:35:05,092 --> 01:35:08,686
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

932
01:35:08,761 --> 01:35:11,356
But we only have
an hour and a half.

933
01:35:12,598 --> 01:35:14,190
Cease firing!

934
01:35:15,602 --> 01:35:18,696
Where's Carlsen?

935
01:35:18,772 --> 01:35:21,037
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored land rover.

936
01:35:21,109 --> 01:35:23,042
Did he say where he was going?

937
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:26,205
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was.

938
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:28,213
Rogers told him,
then I was on the ground.

939
01:35:28,281 --> 01:35:30,375
- Right. Whose car is this?
- That?

940
01:35:30,452 --> 01:35:32,476
- That's the Colonel's.
- Give me the keys.

941
01:35:32,553 --> 01:35:36,284
- What?
- I'm commandeering the car!

942
01:35:36,358 --> 01:35:37,790
Give it to him.

943
01:35:39,293 --> 01:35:40,591
And your side arm.

944
01:35:44,233 --> 01:35:46,666
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

945
01:35:47,935 --> 01:35:50,461
Once you're inside there,
we can't allow you out.

946
01:35:54,276 --> 01:35:55,971
- Watch out!
- He's going in!

947
01:36:00,582 --> 01:36:02,676
Colonel Caine, S.A.S.
I'm crossing the river.

948
01:36:02,752 --> 01:36:05,186
- You don't want to go in there.
- I know I don't.

949
01:36:07,257 --> 01:36:10,693
Get them gates in position!
Secure this post! Move!

950
01:40:11,814 --> 01:40:13,748
I'm glad to see you allve.

951
01:40:14,817 --> 01:40:17,548
I reciprocate the sentiment.

952
01:40:17,622 --> 01:40:21,454
- ls he really dead this time?
- The only way they can be killed.

953
01:40:30,801 --> 01:40:33,429
- Where's Bukovsky?
- Dead.

954
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:38,039
- How?
- Like the rest.

955
01:40:40,144 --> 01:40:42,374
How did you survive?

956
01:40:46,284 --> 01:40:50,549
- You're looking for Carlsen.
- Has he been here?

957
01:40:50,621 --> 01:40:53,216
No. Perhaps he misled you.

958
01:40:53,292 --> 01:40:56,591
- What do you know about it?
- I've been doing some more work.

959
01:40:56,663 --> 01:41:00,722
- Go on.
- I've discovered...

960
01:41:00,799 --> 01:41:03,996
there is life after death.

961
01:41:04,069 --> 01:41:09,235
-How do you know?
-There is a certain mental transference.

962
01:41:09,308 --> 01:41:13,472
Telepathy occurs between
the vampires and their victims.

963
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:20,449
- Carlsen is after the girl.
- How did you know that?

964
01:41:23,656 --> 01:41:27,092
- I seem to sense it.
- Where is she?

965
01:41:29,997 --> 01:41:31,930
Don't you know?

966
01:41:34,835 --> 01:41:37,769
- Carlsen knows.
- Where?

967
01:41:37,837 --> 01:41:41,535
She's in the cathedral.

968
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:44,544
She's been there
since she escaped.

969
01:41:44,612 --> 01:41:47,547
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

970
01:41:47,616 --> 01:41:50,709
The crypt of kings and queens.

971
01:41:50,785 --> 01:41:52,377
Stay where you are.

972
01:42:12,475 --> 01:42:14,067
Here I go.

973
01:43:31,625 --> 01:43:33,616
I knew you would come.

974
01:44:17,941 --> 01:44:19,374
I'm here.

975
01:44:19,442 --> 01:44:22,502
Now can this madness end?

976
01:44:23,479 --> 01:44:25,413
Come.

977
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,176
Be with me.

978
01:44:28,484 --> 01:44:30,384
I need you.

979
01:44:30,454 --> 01:44:32,922
It was always intended...

980
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:34,651
you should find us...

981
01:44:34,725 --> 01:44:37,285
and bring us to Earth.

982
01:44:44,135 --> 01:44:48,366
The web of destiny
carries your blood and soul...

983
01:44:48,439 --> 01:44:51,967
back to the genesis
of my life-form.

984
01:44:58,283 --> 01:44:59,909
Come with me.

985
01:48:11,887 --> 01:48:15,617
It will be much less terrifying
if you just come to me.

986
01:48:21,096 --> 01:48:22,724
I'll do just that.

987
01:49:50,491 --> 01:49:51,923
What are these feelings?

988
01:49:51,992 --> 01:49:55,928
Why do I feel so close to you,
need you?

989
01:49:55,996 --> 01:50:00,457
Because you're one of us.
You always have been.

990
01:50:00,534 --> 01:50:02,502
You're like me.
Be with me.

991
01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:18,286
Just a little more.

992
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
