1
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,691
Do you know
the story of Hanuman?

2
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:11,829
Mm-mm.

3
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,107
No?

4
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:15,247
Look at this.

5
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,526
Look.

6
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,356
The story goes...

7
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,565
When Hanuman was little...

8
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,980
Very little...

9
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,569
He was very hungry.

10
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:28,157
So hungry.

11
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,295
Just like you!

12
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:35,164
He could have eaten any
fruit in the forest.

13
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:38,339
But something cast
a spell on him.

14
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,894
High above the trees.

15
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:45,035
It was a big juicy mango.

16
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,761
So shiny.

17
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,419
Look at this.

18
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:50,972
Do you know what he did?

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,220
Hanuman took to the skies.

20
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,845
Straight towards that fruit.

21
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:05,263
That juicy mango.

22
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:07,713
So shiny.

23
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:12,856
Only to discover...

24
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:14,789
that it wasn't a mango

25
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:20,140
but the burning, hot sun.

26
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:22,832
The gods heard of this...

27
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,248
and gathered to punish him.

28
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:29,528
They taught him a lesson...

29
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:34,706
and stripped young Hanuman
of his powers.

30
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,193
And then what happened, Ma?

31
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:47,339
There are no fucking rules!

32
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:50,170
Fight!

33
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,712
Sir, Tiger, sir.

34
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,407
King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

35
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:59,273
Tiger, I love you!

36
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,940
King Kobra! King Kobra!

37
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:05,659
King Kobra! King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

38
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,350
Whoo!

39
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,421
Good evening.

40
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,699
That's what I' m talking about.

41
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,943
Welcome to Tiger's Temple.

42
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,635
This is a sacred space.

43
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,259
Because some of us here
are Muslim.

44
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:20,846
Some of us are Hindu.

45
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,538
Fuck, maybe there's
a closet Christian

46
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,816
hiding somewhere there
under the rafters.

47
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:31,788
But we here all worship one god:

48
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,756
the Indian rupee!

49
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:44,732
The winner,
the killer of the beast,

50
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,909
King Kobra!

51
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:51,808
Look at this maderchod.
Look at this.

52
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:55,018
That's the smell of victory
right there.

53
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,435
Do you smell it?

54
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,885
'Cause I fucking smell it!

55
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,991
This is a champion. This is...

56
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,792
Fucking hell, guys.
What a night, eh?

57
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:23,037
You hear that?
They fucking hate you.

58
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,315
It's incredible.

59
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:26,765
What a night.

60
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,664
Sarishan,
what's this fucking stomach?

61
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,493
Too many samosas.
You're the Lizard King,

62
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:32,530
not the fucking
Samosa King, okay?

63
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:34,186
This fucking tap!

64
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,913
Aziz, the fucking tap came off
in my hands again, man.

65
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:37,811
Come here.

66
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,640
Look here. What's that?

67
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,791
That fucking stays on. You know
what my water bill is for that?

68
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:42,935
Fix the fucking tap. Please.

69
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,645
Aziz, just fix it,
brother. Please.

70
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:46,312
I ask just for a little bit
of fucking cleanliness.

71
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,166
A little bit of
personal hygiene. Yes, what?

72
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:51,134
Yeah. All right.

73
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:54,275
Don't spend it all at once, eh?

74
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,451
Tiger. Tiger, this is half.

75
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,039
What? That's what
you got last time.

76
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,455
What, are you saving
for a better place to live?

77
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,939
You want another 50%, you bleed.

78
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,528
That's why it's called
the bleed bonus.

79
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,083
I need that money.

80
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,915
Then dance.

81
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:15,227
Don't look at me like that.

82
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:16,539
You chose the name.

83
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:17,957
You're like those
little monkeys,

84
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:19,680
you know, in the marketplace
that go...

85
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,302
with a little pink skirt.

86
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,718
That's you.

87
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,029
Put on a show, get the money.

88
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,527
There's hundreds
of folks out there

89
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:27,101
that'll do this, eh... hundreds...

90
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,036
Waiting to take your place
if this isn't for you.

91
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,939
To live eternal,
and gain immortality.

92
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:38,941
A sacred gift of the Gods,
from Baba Shakti.

93
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,012
<i>Baba Shakti.</i>

94
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,049
<i>Guru, man of peace,
the nation's lion.</i>

95
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:46,776
<i>Born to poverty
but not held captive by it.</i>

96
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:49,365
<i>Indeed, Baba Shakti is now
likely to be seen</i>

97
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,918
<i>in the temples of the elite</i>

98
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,748
<i>than at the temples of the gods,</i>

99
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,991
<i>rubbing shoulders
with the rich and powerful.</i>

100
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,753
<i>Are these the simple actions
of a man made good...</i>

101
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,065
I leave politics
to the politicians.

102
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:02,205
<i>Or the start
of a push for political power</i>

103
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:04,069
<i>through his endorsement
of the controversial</i>

104
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:05,381
<i>Sovereign Party?</i>

105
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,383
If I see a God-fearing man

106
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,075
who is doing good for India,
I will support him.

107
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,664
<i>He has dismissed
rumors that his factory...</i>

108
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,390
Lucky, how's things?

109
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,530
First class, bro.

110
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,843
Boss, get him a Mango Frooti.

111
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,017
Eh! Make it a double.

112
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,572
So?

113
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,616
Lucky, Lucky, Lucky.

114
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,590
This is who you want.

115
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:44,489
Queenie Kapoor,
the queen of Kings.

116
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:47,803
Friday afternoon,
she had a massage

117
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,702
and pedicure at Body Tonic.

118
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,186
Most of the mornings,

119
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,741
she stops at a Café d'Italia
for coffee.

120
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,466
- D'Italia?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,986
She'll be there tomorrow.

122
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,471
But good luck
getting anything out of her.

123
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,887
She's a real hard-ass.

124
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,271
- Ayurvedic wisdom
- Okay.

125
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,929
- Is thousands of years old.
- Good job.

126
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,208
Who are we to question the gods?

127
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:20,318
Vishnu, Lakshmi,
Shiva! For fifty rupees.

128
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:23,321
Yes.
On the dinner table, it was like

129
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,012
a verbal contract.

130
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:29,430
I don't have any mail.

131
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,709
Please, madam,
I haven't eaten in two days.

132
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,296
Please, please, madam.

133
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:36,299
Please, please, madam.

134
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:38,405
I'm... Ow!-

135
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,960
Oh, my God. How can you allow
these guys here?

136
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:43,962
What kind of a place
are you running?

137
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:33,589
Madam?

138
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,246
Yeah?

139
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,218
Where did you find this?

140
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:46,533
Some men were fighting
over it next to, uh, JV Road

141
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,328
near Café d'Italia.

142
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:51,849
I tried to rush in,
and, uh, um...

143
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,092
they fought back and, uh...

144
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,715
- Take this.
- I-I...

145
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,924
I don't...
I don't want charity.

146
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:01,859
Wh-What I need is a... is a job.

147
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:03,274
This is Kings.

148
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,103
We just don't hire
off the street.

149
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:06,484
Where's your references?

150
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:10,212
Your CV? Hmm?

151
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,559
Look, I don't have time
for all this.

152
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,354
Take it and go.

153
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:17,460
This.

154
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:20,740
There's my CV.

155
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:22,258
That's bleach.

156
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:25,296
Chemical, oil.

157
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:29,058
Give me the job
no one wants to do.

158
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,681
I'll do it.

159
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,925
No complaint.

160
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,032
This is all I know.

161
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:52,944
Yeah.

162
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:54,946
No. Uh, no, no. Listen.

163
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:58,018
I actually liked this one
from Indonesia.

164
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,469
Is she broken in?

165
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:03,852
No, th-that's fine, but I just
want to know if, uh...

166
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,577
How quickly
can we get her papers?

167
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:07,890
Hmm?

168
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,874
Anyone who talks
outside these walls,

169
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:28,428
anyone who forgets their place,

170
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:31,017
it doesn't turn out well
for them.

171
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,227
Understood?

172
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,437
Understood.

173
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:52,038
Once more.

174
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:55,248
Oh God, I worship you.

175
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,734
I only worship you.

176
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,461
You are the most powerful one.

177
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:03,981
You are my saviour.

178
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,916
I only worship you.

179
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:14,267
You make us smile
and fill our hearts with love.

180
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:17,166
With our eyes, with our ears.

181
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:20,204
On our lips, we say your name.

182
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:25,071
I sing your praise,
day and night.

183
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,799
I worship you.

184
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,474
New guy, huh?

185
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,512
What's your name?

186
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:56,826
Bobby.

187
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,173
Hmm.

188
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,148
Wear your cap properly.

189
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:11,186
We don't want one of your pubes
in the curry...

190
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,810
Bobby.

191
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,570
I think we met before, right?

192
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,952
I-I don't think so.

193
00:15:19,815 --> 00:15:22,335
You like tequila, huh, Bobby?

194
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:27,029
Patrón, Don Julio, the one with
George Clooney in the photo?

195
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,858
I just want to clean
the dishes, okay?

196
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:30,584
Coke? Morphine? MDMA?

197
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,587
Oi, Alphonso, eh,
I've told you many times

198
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:34,934
to stop hassling my staff.

199
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:37,177
Quality control, man.

200
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:40,111
You're gonna thank me
for this one day.

201
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,219
Stay cool, Bobby.

202
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,497
Stay cool, hmm?

203
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,950
Watch my fucking leg, man.

204
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,259
One regular paan.

205
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:38,514
And a Raju Special.

206
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,108
Lion!

207
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:47,729
Yes.

208
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,663
Take him.

209
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,113
Can I go on his shoulders?

210
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,495
How about a rickshaw,
little bastard? Take him!

211
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,705
Solid.

212
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:58,465
Come.

213
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:22,351
What you got?

214
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:25,182
Paan.

215
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,148
Get inside.

216
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:42,233
Is this all you got?

217
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:44,994
Yeah.

218
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,623
Are you sure?

219
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:56,799
'Cause I got an answer
to every prayer.

220
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,803
You like <i>John Wick?</i>
'Cause this just came in.

221
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,083
Yeah.

222
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,085
The TTI.

223
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:08,190
Same gun from the movie.

224
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,641
But made in China.

225
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:14,334
Boom.

226
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:18,821
I want something small
but effective.

227
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:21,238
38 caliber revolver.

228
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:24,965
It's a little bit heavy,
but it's got a lot of thump.

229
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,244
You need to be pretty close.

230
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,592
Close is good.

231
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,184
I'll take it.

232
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:41,568
Staff entrance. Copy.

233
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,881
Copy. Staff entrance secured.

234
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,440
Huh?

235
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:53,235
You want to go
back to selling your ass

236
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,754
on the street for 500 rupees?

237
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:57,136
I brought you in,
and this is how you repay me?

238
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:58,585
Huh?

239
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,449
Okay, okay. Don't cry.

240
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,106
Don't cry.

241
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:05,592
As soon as Dr. Irani's back,
we'll take care of it.

242
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,835
Yeah?

243
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,562
You're fucking killing me,
Rahul.

244
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,978
No, no, no. Uh-uh.

245
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:13,428
Listen to me...

246
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,878
You call Evgeni
and tell that motherfucker

247
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,502
to find another source.

248
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,573
I made you!

249
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:22,413
Now you think you can sit on
my shoulders and piss in my ear?

250
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:23,852
They're fuck all. Fuck all.

251
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,819
Fuck all.
You understand 'fuck all'?

252
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,684
No, no, no. No, no.
Listen, listen.

253
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,066
I have a reputation to protect, understand?

254
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,412
What the fuck is your problem?

255
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,000
How many times
do I have to tell you

256
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:36,209
fucking knock on the door
and enter...

257
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:37,659
Sorry.
Nishit said you needed me.

258
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:39,350
I need you
to learn some manners,

259
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,938
you inbred little goat fucker.

260
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,872
Rahul,
I'll have to call you back.

261
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,494
Listen, go to Naqeeb

262
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:46,989
and pick up some
Kashmiri snowflake.

263
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:49,636
Good stuff, okay?
None of that cheap shit.

264
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,894
But the problem is, uh,
quality control, it's no good.

265
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,813
Naqeeb has some issue with me,
you know?

266
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,722
I don't know whether it' s
the Christian-Muslim thing

267
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,126
- or what, but...
- Hey.

268
00:19:57,265 --> 00:20:00,233
You. Face the wall.

269
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:06,584
What the fuck
are you talking about?

270
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,517
Tell Naqeeb, if the maal
is good, -

271
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:11,348
we'll buy some more
for Chief Rana.

272
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,143
Get it sorted by the weekend.

273
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:16,353
He is coming with his boys.

274
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,044
- Hey, Alphonso.
- Hmm?

275
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:20,219
Only the best to
serve the VIPs. -

276
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:22,497
- Yeah. Got it.

277
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:26,259
Alphonso. Alphonso.

278
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:29,918
Hey, uh, good job with Queenie,
huh? She really respects you.

279
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:31,056
What do you want?

280
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,543
Um, look, if you... if you...

281
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,349
Look, if you need any help
with the VIPs...

282
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:37,891
Hey, new guy...

283
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,239
You know what happens
to earwigs around here?

284
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:42,009
You hear nothing,
you see nothing. Got it?

285
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,208
Look, I'm just saying,
if you need someone to go in

286
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,634
- and do the job...
- Does it look like

287
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:47,083
I need some help
from someone like you?

288
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:48,143
- Hey.
- Is there so...

289
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,282
What the fuck, man?

290
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,697
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

291
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:53,804
Look, you want to make
some money?

292
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:56,220
Guaranteed?

293
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:57,911
- Go on.
- Okay.

294
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,500
Uh...

295
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:03,123
come to this place tonight.

296
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:08,577
Bet on Khan.
You'll make a killing.

297
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,445
How the fuck do you know?

298
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,690
I-I'll be fighting him.

299
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,318
Fuck off.

300
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:27,872
The monkey will win
the first two rounds

301
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,461
and go down in the third.

302
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,325
What's in it for you?

303
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,809
I want a promotion.

304
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:07,981
Get it!

305
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:21,132
Drill him!
Don't just stand there!

306
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,893
Get back, drill him!

307
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:24,481
Hit me! Hit me!

308
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:27,276
Harder!

309
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:28,830
Come on!

310
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:30,141
Harder! Hit me!

311
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,660
Don't just stand there, mate!

312
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:33,524
Give him some of that Kong shit.

313
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,949
Fucking yes! Fucking yes!

314
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:50,058
Fuck yes! Whoo!
You fucking beauty!

315
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:51,404
Mwah!

316
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:54,614
Get this fucking monkey
off here.

317
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:56,996
Guys, get the monkey off here.

318
00:22:57,134 --> 00:23:01,518
The winner,
the killer of the beast,

319
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:05,142
Sher Khan!

320
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:25,058
Make sure the drinks
never dry up.

321
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,898
Eyes to the ground
unless someone calls you,

322
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:28,717
then you will get over there
like you got

323
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:30,270
a chili up your asshole.

324
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,238
You see that?
That's the defense minister.

325
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:35,172
He always has a mushroom steak
followed by a threesome.

326
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,760
This one just likes to watch.

327
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:38,116
But he's the head
of the tax office,

328
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,487
so anything is allowed,
you know?

329
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,799
A very good evening, Mr. Gupta.

330
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,181
Hope you are having a good time.

331
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,700
Enjoy.

332
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,080
Filthy bastard.

333
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:01,405
You're
looking beautiful today, huh?

334
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:04,615
Hey... You see
those yellow fellas over there?

335
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:07,894
That's Mr. Takahata.

336
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:09,793
He always asks Queenie
for the special menu.

337
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,174
We've got girls
from all over the world, man.

338
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:14,798
Dubai, Russia, Singapore.

339
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:17,110
There's a dish
to please every king. Look.

340
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,423
He's about to receive
a gift from heaven.

341
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,669
Here she is... Sylvia.

342
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:25,809
Former Miss Lithuania.

343
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:30,986
She's come down
to guide him to the afterlife.

344
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,092
Come on.

345
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,403
That's Mirza.

346
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,922
The boss of the bosses.

347
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,924
He runs everything
in this town, man.

348
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,409
Drugs, property, import, export.

349
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:42,342
You name it.

350
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,930
What about the cops?

351
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:45,967
They're the dirtiest fuckers.

352
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:48,556
You know what I'm meaning.

353
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,111
And Chief Rana?

354
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:55,148
Up in the VIP room.

355
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,841
He loves the sugar.

356
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:13,373
Isn't she beautiful?

357
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,099
I call her Nicki.

358
00:25:17,654 --> 00:25:18,862
Minaj.

359
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,865
Big bumper, nice headlights.

360
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:23,556
Huh? Come on, brother.

361
00:25:23,694 --> 00:25:25,109
Let's boogie.

362
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,909
- Seat belt, buddy.
- What for?

363
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:33,127
This for.

364
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,738
What happened to your hands?

365
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:09,568
They're fucked up, bro.

366
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:14,331
Car crash. Engine caught fire.

367
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:15,746
Bullshit.

368
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:17,955
I know what that is.

369
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:20,717
Too much pocket pinball, huh?

370
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:22,339
You know what I'm meaning.

371
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:25,031
But you're living the life, bro.

372
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,103
We're rolling with
the kings now, huh?

373
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:31,210
They don't even see us.

374
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:37,941
They're all up there living,
and we're stuck here in this.

375
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,529
That's no life, bro.

376
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:44,810
So, what are you gonna do
about this, Monkey Man? Huh?

377
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:55,648
Bought myself a bit
of land over here down south.

378
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:57,857
- You like that?
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:00,895
Mate.

380
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,344
What are you doing?

381
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:05,209
That's red wine.

382
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:06,797
Yes, sir.

383
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:09,144
Well, that's a white wine glass.

384
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,838
Who is this guy, huh?

385
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:15,713
Can we get somebody
over here who knows...

386
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,739
Tell me more
about your trip, baby.

387
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,639
No.

388
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:23,365
No, no, no, no, no.

389
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:25,091
I, uh...

390
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,646
I want to know about you.

391
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:30,718
What's this?

392
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:32,720
Little birdie?

393
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:35,688
- It's a sparrow.
- Want to fly away, do you?

394
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:37,725
Queenie was right.

395
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:41,556
You are not like
the other girls.

396
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:42,971
I'll treat you like an angel.

397
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,905
My Indian princess.

398
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,743
We can fuck right here.

399
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:57,952
Not here, baby.

400
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,393
Nothing will happen.
Don't lose heart.

401
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:31,640
This land is
now declared a holy site.

402
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,574
You must vacate immediately!

403
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,129
This land belongs
to our ancestors.

404
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:39,787
Tell him to shove
these papers up his ass!

405
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:41,996
Our blood is in the soil!

406
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:44,723
We will never
give you this land.

407
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:46,690
We will never
give you this land!

408
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,364
Ma!

409
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:11,957
Ma!

410
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,249
How did you get in?

411
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,027
No, no. Come.

412
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:24,305
Come, come. Good girl.

413
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:27,895
There you go.
There you go. Good girl.

414
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,035
You like that?

415
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:37,111
That's good. You like that?

416
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:38,975
She'd better.

417
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:41,356
It's 4,000 rupees a plate.

418
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:55,060
This is not the place to work

419
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:57,269
if you can't handle
that sort of stuff.

420
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,590
It's not a sparrow.

421
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,284
Your tattoo.

422
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:14,631
It's a koel.

423
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,188
I grew up in the forest.

424
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:25,055
Every day, I would wake up
to them singing.

425
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:36,653
Stop feeding that dog.

426
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:40,001
It's gonna keep coming back
expecting more.

427
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:43,211
Just gives her hope.

428
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,065
Next.

429
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,726
Sit. Sit. Sit.

430
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,008
What the fuck you doing, man?

431
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:24,080
- For the dog.
- Come on, man. Let's boogie.

432
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:33,192
Sit.

433
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:49,691
<i>Baba Shakti today
held a public prayer</i>

434
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,831
<i>for victims of the ongoing
land disputes,</i>

435
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,421
<i>advocating that violence

436
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,492
<i>Elsewhere,

441
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,199
<i>You're supposed to be a monkey.</i>

442
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:15,648
Do you know that a chimpanzee

443
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,616
can rip a fucking
human being's face off?

444

<i>Get out there and fucking
behave like a fucking beast.</i>

445
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,686
Check.

446
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:16,123
Good girl.

447
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:18,470
There you go.

448
00:34:19,678 --> 00:34:21,059
Good girl.

449
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:43,322
Where the fuck you been, man?

450
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,060
I nearly finished it all
waiting for you.

451
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,325
You ready?

452
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:51,330
Let's boogie.

453
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:53,263
This guy. Come on.

454
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:00,857
Hey, Fresca.

455
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,755
Brought you a new boyfriend.

456
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:07,726
Welcome to heaven, baby.

457
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:31,957
Penthouse.

458
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:34,442
Only Queenie can go up. Come on.

459
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,616
Get busy.

460
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,245
Mwah.

461
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:49,267
Hey, Alphonso.
Show us your leg.

462
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:51,027
Huh?

463
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,823
Fucker tried to run
from a drug deal,

464
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:55,411
so they chopped it off.

465
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:57,309
Isn't that right?

466
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:59,346
Tell me one thing.

467
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:02,003
Your dick still works, huh?

468
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:05,904
He doesn't need one.
He's got no balls.

469
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:09,701
Fuck off, go get my maal now.

470
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,289
Here, sir.

471
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,607
Come here, baby.

472
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:39,169
Gimme a towel, asshole.

473
00:39:47,523 --> 00:39:49,525
What the fuck is this?

474
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:54,046
Blessings from my mother.

475
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:55,107
I hope your mother
fucks harder than you fight.

476
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:19,097
Who the fuck
are you, you little rat?

477
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,757
Hey!

478
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,459
Rasul!
Where the fuck are you?

479
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:56,219
The attacker is
in the parking lot!

480
00:44:17,102 --> 00:44:19,035
Wake up, asshole!

481
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:34,741
Hey! Hey! Bobby, wait!

482
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:37,709
Get in!

483
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:55,244
Out of all the fucking cars
in there, you stole mine?

484
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:56,382
Alphonso, shut up!

485
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:01,077
What the fuck did you do, man?

486
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:02,935
- Fuck! Fuck!
- What were you thinking, man?

487
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:07,532
- Oh, man. Fuck, fuck.
- Fuck!

488
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,372
Stop the vehicle now!

489
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:10,673
Ah, fuck.

490
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,330
Stop the car now!

491
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:14,850
What do I press?
Put the fucking gear, brother!

492
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:17,576
Fuck!

493
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,276
Fuck, man!

494
00:45:33,938 --> 00:45:35,191
- Duck, duck, duck, duck!
- Fuck!

495
00:45:35,215 --> 00:45:38,114
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck, man!

496
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,912
Fuck!

497
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,121
Oh!

498
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:48,815
Fuck.

499
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:53,509
Turbo! Turbo!

500
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:56,857
Fuck!

501
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,793
Fuck. Oh, man.

502
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:24,574
- Did we lose them?
- Drive! Just drive!

503
00:46:24,712 --> 00:46:26,749
Look out!

504
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:48,391
Bobby, get up, man. Come on.

505
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:54,604
I am sorry, bro.

506
00:46:54,742 --> 00:46:56,227
I am sorry.

507
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:38,269
Stubborn bastard, isn't he?

508
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,263
The boss is gonna eat him alive.

509
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:10,301
He's not going to spare him.

510
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:53,516
Fuck.

511
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:37,905
You want to fuck, huh?

512
00:49:38,044 --> 00:49:41,323
You want to fuck,
motherfucker, huh?

513
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:46,707
You bring the police
to my place, huh?

514
00:49:46,845 --> 00:49:48,847
How dare you.

515
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:54,543
Hey. Easy.

516
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:45,145
Run away from here!

517
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:29,120
Police!

518
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:31,295
This is your last warning!

519
00:51:35,264 --> 00:51:36,990
Target in sight.

520
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,619
I only worship you.

521
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:56,759
You are the most powerful one.

522
00:52:56,897 --> 00:52:58,071
You are my saviour.

523
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,384
Slowly, slowly, slowly.
And then?

524
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:01,764
You make us smile with love.

525
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:03,835
- And?
- Keep our hearts free from sin.

526
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:05,009
Really good!

527
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,045
Should we take some
of these home?

528
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,219
Yes, ok.

529
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:10,394
I will make you
chutney with this.

530
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:14,812
Look at these roots
and how strong they are.

531
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:18,091
Where do you think they go?

532
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:20,921
- I don't know.
- Deep below the ground.

533
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:24,787
And how do the roots
grow from the ground?

534
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:28,343
Show me yours.

535
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:31,760
This is the first root.

536
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:32,968
This is the second root.

537
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:34,625
And this is the third root.

538
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:38,801
So, our hands also have roots...

539
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:41,425
They tell us what
we'll do in the future.

540
00:53:41,563 --> 00:53:43,530
What will you do in the future?

541
00:53:44,669 --> 00:53:45,670
Um...

542
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,826
You're okay.

543
00:54:37,964 --> 00:54:40,311
You're okay.

544
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,011
You're awake.

545
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:28,428
Finally.

546
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:32,950
Beautiful.

547
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:35,608
Isn't she?

548
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,200
Parvati and Shiva.

549
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,686
One half devotion,

550
00:55:44,824 --> 00:55:48,379
the other destruction.

551
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,692
Male.

552
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:53,764
Female.

553
00:55:53,902 --> 00:55:55,317
Neither.

554
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:57,802
Both.

555
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:04,188
Some people find that...

556
00:56:04,326 --> 00:56:05,879
strange.

557
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:11,678
But we hijras understand it
completely.

558
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:15,061
Who are you?

559
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:20,031
I'm Alpha,
the keeper of the temple.

560
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,795
Careful! Careful!

561
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:34,667
Why did you help me?

562
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:38,049
You should've died
from those injuries.

563
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:42,433
The gods must have
a greater plan for you.

564
00:56:44,573 --> 00:56:47,611
We all have scars.

565
00:56:51,718 --> 00:56:53,651
I should go.

566
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,757
No. I wouldn't do that.

567
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:58,104
The police are looking for you.

568
00:56:58,242 --> 00:56:59,864
All over town.

569
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:02,177
But not here.

570
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:05,663
They find us too...

571
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:08,942
unsettling.

572
00:57:11,048 --> 00:57:13,015
Stay with us.

573
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:14,983
Rest.

574
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,848
You need to heal.

575
00:57:21,092 --> 00:57:24,026
Maybe she'll speak to you.

576
00:57:31,655 --> 00:57:34,209
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

577
00:57:34,347 --> 00:57:38,213
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

578
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:41,319
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

579
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,220
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

580
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:47,878
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

581
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:53,055
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!
Shakti! Shakti!

582
00:58:09,624 --> 00:58:11,902
Who is he?

583
00:58:13,144 --> 00:58:14,939
He's a nobody.

584
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:18,218
Just some crazy kid
from the gutter.

585
00:58:18,356 --> 00:58:21,359
People once said that about me.

586
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,500
And now look at you.

587
00:58:23,638 --> 00:58:26,157
You 're the nation' s lion.

588
00:58:28,056 --> 00:58:30,817
You said he spoke of his mother.

589
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:34,649
Don't worry about him...

590
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:37,583
He's a walking corpse.

591
00:58:39,274 --> 00:58:40,309
Rana...

592
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,762
in the great tapestry of life,

593
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,664
just one small ember
can burn down everything.

594
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:53,495
The very idea of him

595
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:55,877
has to be extinguished.

596
00:58:57,603 --> 00:58:59,052
Find him.

597
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:03,125
Before your nobody
becomes a somebody.

598
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:12,065
The trail of destruction
started with a murder attempt

599
00:59:12,203 --> 00:59:15,379
on Yatana's chief of police,
Rana Singh,

600
00:59:15,517 --> 00:59:18,175
by a terrorist
posing as a member of staff.

601
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:20,798
A citywide manhunt is underway
for the terrorist

602
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:23,387
and his known associates.

603
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:26,217
Security has been raised
for the upcoming elections,

604
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:30,014
which are occurring on the
country's most auspicious day.

605
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:07,017
- Thank you.
- So, uh...

606
01:00:07,155 --> 01:00:11,090
This one is
a story of husband and wife...

607
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:12,228
Husband.

608
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:14,471
And wife.

609
01:00:33,215 --> 01:00:35,839
Now they are okay.

610
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:40,947
But...

611
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:55,444
And that is why
she ran away with the priest.

612
01:01:07,836 --> 01:01:09,735
Funny, huh?

613
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:33,482
Still can't sleep?

614
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,452
I never sleep.

615
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,973
Voices in your head?

616
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:44,217
Just one.

617
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:48,877
Her scream.

618
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:54,089
It's been inside me
my whole life.

619
01:01:58,818 --> 01:02:00,855
Come with me.

620
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:35,510
We were warriors before
they drove us into exile here.

621
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:40,170
The Vedas speak of a tree

622
01:02:40,308 --> 01:02:43,311
that was supposedly planted
by Lord Shiva,

623
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:47,798
the destroyer of worlds.

624
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,926
I was once like you.

625
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,514
A broken man.

626
01:03:16,344 --> 01:03:19,243
A slave to childhood terrors.

627
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,525
I learned that you need
to destroy in order to grow.

628
01:03:26,664 --> 01:03:29,046
To create space for new life.

629
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:39,125
Mm. Here we go.

630
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,336
Within its root lies
a potent toxin.

631
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:47,168
We call it Trishul
after Shiva's trident.

632
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,999
It will cut you open.

633
01:03:52,483 --> 01:03:57,972
Only a weakened man
can benefit from this.

634
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:02,562
Only a strong man
can survive it.

635
01:04:05,082 --> 01:04:07,188
Are you ready?

636
01:04:08,672 --> 01:04:10,329
Yes.

637
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:29,244
The pain...

638
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:34,249
It will leave you once
it's finished teaching you.

639
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,915
Brothers and Sisters!

640
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:05,297
Welcome to the tale
of the Ramayana.

641
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:07,644
In each generation,
the story repeats itself.

642
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:13,546
The captive Princess...

643
01:07:13,684 --> 01:07:16,239
And her fight
with the Demon King.

644
01:07:17,964 --> 01:07:19,173
I'm Ravan!

645
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:22,900
Evil King, please let me go.

646
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,488
Nobody says no to me!

647
01:07:28,665 --> 01:07:30,218
But then!

648
01:07:30,356 --> 01:07:31,668
And then came the mighty one!

649
01:07:31,806 --> 01:07:33,842
- Mum, that's Hanuman!
- Yes, it is.

650
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,913
Take the first blow of my club.

651
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,169
Feel my monkey strength!

652
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,620
I'm Hanuman!

653
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:03,251
Speak.

654
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:06,841
Go Rana, go.

655
01:08:07,531 --> 01:08:10,293
Time to do God's work.

656
01:08:22,822 --> 01:08:25,308
They're back.
The Police are back.

657
01:08:25,446 --> 01:08:27,758
Get up. Run, everyone.

658
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:30,140
Hurry, hurry.

659
01:08:30,278 --> 01:08:32,522
Run! We must evacuate.
It's the Police.

660
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:06,935
Listen to me.

661
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:10,076
You go upstairs and hide.
And don't make a sound.

662
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,148
No, no, listen to me.
Listen to me.

663
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:15,151
Go upstairs and hide. And don't
even make a slight sound.

664
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:16,497
But what about you?

665
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:18,084
Nothing will happen to me.

666
01:09:18,223 --> 01:09:19,603
Like how a mouse hides?

667
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:22,296
You hide like a mouse
and make no sound.

668
01:09:22,434 --> 01:09:23,607
Do you trust Mum?

669
01:09:23,745 --> 01:09:25,161
Do you trust me?

670
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:26,645
Nothing will happen.

671
01:09:26,783 --> 01:09:29,234
Nothing will happen.
Don't lose heart.

672
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:30,856
Don't lose heart.

673
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,513
You are my Hanuman.

674
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:35,723
Quickly.

675
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,867
Quickly, quickly.

676
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:06,823
You've built a sweet home.

677
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,965
What were you saying outside?

678
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:14,520
Huh?

679
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:17,074
Shove those papers up your ass.

680
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,317
Is that right?

681
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:42,721
Bloody whore!

682
01:10:44,826 --> 01:10:46,897
You'll shove it up my ass, huh?

683
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:50,246
I'll show you.

684
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:51,592
Get up, bitch.

685
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:07,866
I failed her.

686
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:12,180
No.

687
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:16,046
You tried to save her.

688
01:13:20,085 --> 01:13:21,983
You see scars.

689
01:13:24,089 --> 01:13:28,611
I see the courage of a child
fighting to save his mother.

690
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:33,719
These are the hands of a warrior

691
01:13:33,857 --> 01:13:37,343
who's destined
to challenge the gods.

692
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,348
All your life, you've been
fighting to feel pain.

693
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:45,973
You need to fight for a purpose.

694
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:51,392
Fight... for all of us.

695
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:56,570
It's time to remember
who you are.

696
01:14:04,163 --> 01:14:05,855
<i>As the Sovereign Party</i>

697
01:14:05,993 --> 01:14:08,202
<i>climbs in the polls,
allegations have surfaced</i>

698
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,894
<i>that you destroyed
200 acres of forestland</i>

699
01:14:11,032 --> 01:14:13,241
<i>to build your mega factory.</i>

700
01:14:13,379 --> 01:14:14,691
It's not a factory.

701
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:16,106
It's a commune.

702
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:17,901
<i>And what about the farmers</i>

703
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:19,903
<i>that have been displaced?</i>

704
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:21,595
<i>Ah.</i>

705
01:14:21,733 --> 01:14:24,252
<i>The land was barren and empty.</i>

706
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:28,084
Few families who lived there
have joined the cause.

707
01:14:28,222 --> 01:14:30,362
<i>And workers who complain</i>

708
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,260
<i>of horrible working conditions?</i>

709
01:14:32,398 --> 01:14:34,331
<i>They aren't workers.</i>

710
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,610
<i>They are my disciples.</i>

711
01:16:19,644 --> 01:16:21,956
Yeah.

712
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,700
Hmm.

713
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:50,778
Ah.

714
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,360
Get up.

715
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:28,126
A surge of sectarian violence
has exploded around the country

716
01:17:28,264 --> 01:17:31,750
<i>after divisive remarks
made by Adesh Joshi.</i>

717
01:17:31,888 --> 01:17:34,995
<i>International leaders
have condemned the violence</i>

718
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:37,653
<i>against minorities
but have stopped short</i>

719
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:41,760
<i>of criticizing the candidate
as he climbs in the polls.</i>

720
01:18:13,205 --> 01:18:15,656
<i>Close your eyes,</i>

721
01:18:15,794 --> 01:18:18,970
<i>and you will find yourself</i>

722
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:22,559
<i>sitting atop a mighty tree.</i>

723
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,701
<i>This is your home.</i>

724
01:18:25,839 --> 01:18:28,324
<i>You are a beast.</i>

725
01:18:29,049 --> 01:18:31,983
<i>Look beneath the surface,</i>

726
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:36,159
<i>and you will see roots
deep under the soil,</i>

727
01:18:36,297 --> 01:18:38,299
<i>reaching far and wide.</i>

728
01:18:38,437 --> 01:18:41,682
<i>These are the roots
of your ancestors,</i>

729
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,684
<i>the soul of your mother.</i>

730
01:18:43,822 --> 01:18:45,824
<i>Listen to her.</i>

731
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,654
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>

732
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:51,416
<i>You've been here for time.</i>

733
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:06,983
People of Yatana...

734
01:19:08,329 --> 01:19:09,883
Baba Shakti!

735
01:19:10,021 --> 01:19:12,057
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

736
01:19:12,195 --> 01:19:15,509
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

737
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:18,063
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

738
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:20,548
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

739
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:22,378
I am nobody.

740
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:24,690
I am nothing.

741
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:26,416
I didn't choose this path.

742
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:29,903
You chose it for me.

743
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:33,216
Change never comes
without a fight.

744
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:39,533
I want you to choose
another of God's men.

745
01:19:40,603 --> 01:19:44,676
He's one of us.
He is Adesh Joshi,

746
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:47,921
leader of Sovereign Party.

747
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:53,789
He will fight with us,
for us, for you.

748
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:59,656
The working man,
the poor, the sick.

749
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,556
<i>Shower him with your love</i>

750
01:20:02,694 --> 01:20:05,524
<i>and let our voice be heard</i>

751
01:20:05,662 --> 01:20:08,044
<i>throughout the nation.</i>

752
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:15,672
<i>They have destroyed</i>

753
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,089
<i>our sacred values.</i>

754
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:21,368
<i>They have stolen our homes,</i>

755
01:20:21,506 --> 01:20:24,267
<i>poisoned our children's minds.</i>

756
01:20:25,544 --> 01:20:28,478
<i>They have polluted us
with their symbols,</i>

757
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:31,171
<i>their false idols.</i>

758
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:33,483
<i>We have been blinded.</i>

759
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:36,279
<i>Will you stand with us?</i>

760
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,868
<i>Will you bleed with us?</i>

761
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,975
<i>Will you?</i>

762
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:43,561
<i>Will you?</i>

763
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:49,120
Victory for Mother India.

764
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:57,991
Victory for Mother India!

765
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,532
Lakshmi!

766
01:21:25,466 --> 01:21:27,537
Tell me what happened
to Lakshmi.

767
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,367
- Lakshmi!
- Lakshmi!

768
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:31,369
- Lakshmi.
- Are you okay, Lakshmi?

769
01:21:31,507 --> 01:21:32,888
What happened? What happened?

770
01:21:33,026 --> 01:21:35,373
These men put a notice
on the door.

771
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:37,858
She tried to take it down,
but they beat her.

772
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:40,378
She's not breathing.
Breathe, Lakshmi, breathe.

773
01:21:40,516 --> 01:21:42,000
Did you see?
Did you see who it was?

774
01:21:42,138 --> 01:21:43,450
Shakti's men.

775
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:46,039
They said the temple
never belonged to us.

776
01:21:46,177 --> 01:21:48,489
Alpha, where will we go?

777
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:51,320
If we don't have money,
they will keep doing this.

778
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:54,979
We cannot pay off some thugs.

779
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:57,705
We all must pray.

780
01:21:57,843 --> 01:21:59,535
Lakshmi!

781
01:22:00,156 --> 01:22:01,606
God has a plan.

782
01:22:55,901 --> 01:22:57,800
We have the
election results due to break

783
01:22:57,938 --> 01:22:59,319
during Diwali festival.

784
01:22:59,457 --> 01:23:01,193
Sovereign Party supporters
are flooding the streets

785
01:23:01,217 --> 01:23:04,082
with the party expecting
a landslide victory.

786
01:23:07,568 --> 01:23:09,777
- Baba!
- Shakti!

787
01:23:09,915 --> 01:23:11,745
- Baba!
- Shakti!

788
01:23:11,883 --> 01:23:15,611
- Baba! Baba!
- Shakti! Shakti!

789
01:23:15,749 --> 01:23:20,616
Ladies and gentlemen!

790
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:28,969
Are you ready
for a fucking fight?

791
01:23:40,498 --> 01:23:41,878
Put it on the monkey.

792
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:47,194
On my left,
the still undisputed champion

793
01:23:47,332 --> 01:23:50,163
of all of India,

794
01:23:50,301 --> 01:23:54,753
the s-s-s-s-snake...

795
01:23:54,891 --> 01:23:58,378
King Kobra!

796
01:24:07,318 --> 01:24:09,561
King Kobra! King Kobra!

797
01:24:09,699 --> 01:24:12,185
Okay, settle down.

798
01:24:12,323 --> 01:24:13,600
Settle down, you animals.

799
01:24:13,738 --> 01:24:16,603
Settle down.

800
01:24:16,741 --> 01:24:18,501
From His Majesty

801
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:24,093
all the way to the deepest,
darkest jungles

802
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:26,820
of my mother Africa...

803
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:29,995
I hunted him down.

804
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:32,101
I...

805
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,345
darted him myself,

806
01:24:34,483 --> 01:24:37,037
and I brought him
all the way here

807
01:24:37,175 --> 01:24:39,350
for your entertainment.

808
01:24:39,488 --> 01:24:41,869
He's evil.

809
01:24:42,007 --> 01:24:44,424
He's ferocious.

810
01:24:44,562 --> 01:24:47,979
He's a dark destroyer.

811
01:24:48,117 --> 01:24:51,500
I give you...

812
01:24:51,638 --> 01:24:54,192
Kong!

813
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:02,580
Do you want to see
these two animals fight?

814
01:25:04,478 --> 01:25:06,825
The snake and the monkey.

815
01:25:07,826 --> 01:25:08,862
Fight!

816
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,829
King Kobra! King Kobra!

817
01:25:10,967 --> 01:25:16,076
King Kobra! King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

818
01:25:16,214 --> 01:25:17,802
Ooh, I smell it.

819
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:20,011
I smell it.

820
01:25:26,086 --> 01:25:27,777
- Hey.
- What's going on?

821
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,541
Did he fucking knock him out?

822
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:35,337
Kobra, get up.

823
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:39,479
You get him fucking up
right now.

824
01:25:42,102 --> 01:25:43,345
I will fuck...

825
01:25:43,483 --> 01:25:47,383
Grab his arms and take him off.

826
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:02,881
Wow, eh?

827
01:26:03,019 --> 01:26:06,264
Wow.

828
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:10,786
That was a surprise.

829
01:26:15,308 --> 01:26:19,553
Fucking lucky kick, eh?

830
01:26:21,003 --> 01:26:23,764
Looks like we got
a cheeky little monkey

831
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:25,421
on our hands tonight.

832
01:26:25,559 --> 01:26:27,043
Kill the beast!

833
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,977
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
Kill the beast!

834
01:26:30,115 --> 01:26:35,224
Ladies and gentlemen...

835
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:40,747
I give you the biggest,
the baddest,

836
01:26:40,885 --> 01:26:44,026
the bone crushing

837
01:26:44,164 --> 01:26:48,272
Bhalu the Bear!

838
01:26:55,244 --> 01:26:56,487
Fuck him up.

839
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,905
Fucking smash his head in, okay?

840
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,904
Get in there
and fucking pummel him.

841
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:01,285
Go. Go.

842
01:27:01,423 --> 01:27:03,425
Fuck him up.

843
01:27:16,852 --> 01:27:18,992
Smack him in the fucking cock!

844
01:27:31,867 --> 01:27:32,868
Come on!

845
01:27:38,114 --> 01:27:39,184
Drill him!

846
01:27:39,323 --> 01:27:41,773
Drill his fucking skull in!

847
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:44,776
Drill him in the fucking face!

848
01:27:49,678 --> 01:27:51,887
Go on, smack him, Bhalu!

849
01:27:52,025 --> 01:27:53,751
Come on, then!

850
01:28:06,729 --> 01:28:09,974
Go on, Monkey Man! Yes!

851
01:28:14,496 --> 01:28:16,221
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

852
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:21,192
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

853
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,643
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
Kill the beast!

854
01:28:23,781 --> 01:28:26,024
Kill the beast!
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

855
01:28:26,162 --> 01:28:29,511
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
Kill the beast!

856
01:28:29,649 --> 01:28:32,065
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

857
01:28:41,523 --> 01:28:43,559
Hail the mighty one!

858
01:28:43,697 --> 01:28:46,182
Hail Monkey Man!

859
01:28:47,839 --> 01:28:50,773
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

860
01:28:50,911 --> 01:28:55,088
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!
Monkey Man!

861
01:28:55,226 --> 01:28:57,193
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

862
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:01,405
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

863
01:29:01,543 --> 01:29:03,924
Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

864
01:29:04,062 --> 01:29:06,237
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!
Monkey Man!

865
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:07,790
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

866
01:29:07,928 --> 01:29:10,552
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

867
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:12,657
Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

868
01:29:12,795 --> 01:29:15,626
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

869
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:17,800
Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

870
01:29:17,938 --> 01:29:20,320
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!
Monkey Man!

871
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,771
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

872
01:29:22,909 --> 01:29:25,532
Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

873
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:27,879
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

874
01:29:28,017 --> 01:29:31,366
Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

875
01:29:47,934 --> 01:29:50,005
Alpha.

876
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:51,558
Take a look.

877
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:53,905
What is that?

878
01:29:56,045 --> 01:29:58,082
Take a look.

879
01:30:00,256 --> 01:30:02,569
- There's a note.
- There's a note.

880
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:05,607
Oh, my God.

881
01:30:05,745 --> 01:30:07,125
Oh, my, my.

882
01:30:07,263 --> 01:30:09,265
I mean, look at this.

883
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,336
Whoa.

884
01:30:11,475 --> 01:30:13,304
- Who sent us this?
- Wow.

885
01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:15,789
It's money.

886
01:31:07,703 --> 01:31:09,256
Baba!

887
01:31:09,394 --> 01:31:12,501
Baba! Baba!

888
01:31:46,362 --> 01:31:50,366
Baba Shakti! Baba Shakti!

889
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:12,147
Baba Shakti! Baba Shakti!

890
01:32:12,285 --> 01:32:16,772
Baba Shakti! Baba Shakti!
Baba Shakti!

891
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:20,155
Baba Shakti! Baba Shakti!

892
01:32:22,433 --> 01:32:25,194
Listen up, everyone,
if anybody fucks up tonight,

893
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:28,577
if anybody messes up,
if I get a single complaint,

894
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:30,372
I'll fuck your happiness.

895
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:35,170
Stop staring at me!
First course out right now!

896
01:32:36,205 --> 01:32:37,862
It's brilliant. Very good.

897
01:32:39,968 --> 01:32:41,728
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

898
01:32:41,866 --> 01:32:43,454
Thank you.

899
01:32:43,592 --> 01:32:47,527
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an honor it is to be here

900
01:32:47,665 --> 01:32:51,738
with the Sovereign Party on the
cusp of our historic victory.

901
01:32:51,876 --> 01:32:54,465
One day, the maharajas
on these walls

902
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:56,709
will be replaced with portraits

903
01:32:56,847 --> 01:32:59,332
of each and every one of you.

904
01:33:06,408 --> 01:33:08,824
Hey, smart-ass.

905
01:33:10,688 --> 01:33:11,689
Staff entrance.

906
01:33:27,153 --> 01:33:30,915
We will rid Mother India
of her scars

907
01:33:31,053 --> 01:33:34,056
and make her beautiful
once more.

908
01:33:36,231 --> 01:33:37,991
<i>I would like to acknowledge</i>

909
01:33:38,129 --> 01:33:40,511
<i>the great contribution
of a mighty chief of police,</i>

910
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:41,754
Rana Singh.

911
01:33:43,065 --> 01:33:46,448
His courage and integrity

912
01:33:46,586 --> 01:33:49,382
<i>has led to Yatana's
lowest crime rate.</i>

913
01:34:08,056 --> 01:34:09,160
Hey!

914
01:35:04,181 --> 01:35:05,700
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

915
01:35:47,327 --> 01:35:49,295
There is this one other person

916
01:35:49,433 --> 01:35:52,988
without whose blessing
we would not be here.

917
01:35:55,508 --> 01:35:56,923
My guru.

918
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,236
<i>My mentor.</i>

919
01:36:00,133 --> 01:36:02,515
His Holiness, India's lion,

920
01:36:02,653 --> 01:36:04,137
Baba Shak...

921
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,826
Go! Go! Go! Go!

922
01:36:37,964 --> 01:36:39,759
Get him upstairs.
Get him upstairs.

923
01:37:29,395 --> 01:37:30,775
Hey! Hey!

924
01:39:56,231 --> 01:39:58,061
You motherfucker!

925
01:40:00,373 --> 01:40:02,168
Don't fuck with me!

926
01:40:02,306 --> 01:40:05,137
I'll kill you, you bastard!

927
01:40:11,626 --> 01:40:13,524
I'm gonna blow your fucking...

928
01:42:24,448 --> 01:42:27,175
Finally out of your tree, huh?

929
01:42:28,072 --> 01:42:30,144
Get up.

930
01:42:55,893 --> 01:43:00,243
Did your mother
send you back for more, huh?

931
01:43:39,903 --> 01:43:41,767
Get up, motherfucker!

932
01:43:50,293 --> 01:43:51,949
You son of a whore.

933
01:43:54,089 --> 01:43:55,470
What are you looking at?

934
01:46:04,081 --> 01:46:05,566
Get up!

935
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:22,574
Welcome, Queenie.

936
01:48:30,365 --> 01:48:32,022
So, you are the one?

937
01:48:39,616 --> 01:48:41,929
Look at them all.

938
01:48:42,067 --> 01:48:43,240
Diwali.

939
01:48:43,378 --> 01:48:47,521
The triumph of light
over darkness.

940
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:51,697
The defeat of Ravan.

941
01:48:52,318 --> 01:48:55,218
But Ravan was no demon.

942
01:48:55,356 --> 01:48:57,979
He was a scholar.

943
01:48:58,117 --> 01:49:00,085
A visionary.

944
01:49:02,018 --> 01:49:05,055
He built an empire from nothing.

945
01:49:17,171 --> 01:49:22,797
Why not end this cycle
of violence?

946
01:49:24,212 --> 01:49:28,665
Or we will be trapped in it
for generations.

947
01:49:31,219 --> 01:49:34,084
Do you even know
my mother's name?

948
01:49:38,123 --> 01:49:40,746
Do you know any of their names?

949
01:49:43,887 --> 01:49:47,753
Anger will not quiet
your soul, my son.

950
01:49:53,863 --> 01:49:56,003
Don't call me 'son.'

951
01:50:02,216 --> 01:50:06,289
These were carved
by a devout follower

952
01:50:07,462 --> 01:50:09,603
who wore them
to prevent his feet

953
01:50:09,741 --> 01:50:12,364
from harming any small creature.

954
01:50:12,502 --> 01:50:16,782
On the side here,
there's an old prayer:

955
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,890
'Forgive me, Mother Earth,
for the sin of injury

956
01:50:21,028 --> 01:50:24,548
which I inflict with each step.'

957
01:50:27,482 --> 01:50:29,415
My chariot is here.

958
01:51:19,638 --> 01:51:23,400
You can't.
These people need me.

959
01:51:23,538 --> 01:51:24,678
Please.

960
01:51:24,816 --> 01:51:27,059
I'll give you what you want.

961
01:51:27,197 --> 01:51:29,579
I'll do anything.

962
01:51:29,717 --> 01:51:31,029
Forgive me.

963
01:51:31,167 --> 01:51:34,653
Ha-Ha-Have mercy, please.

964
01:51:34,791 --> 01:51:37,414
Only God can forgive you now.

965
01:52:20,630 --> 01:52:23,875
Oh God, I worship you.

966
01:52:24,496 --> 01:52:26,843
I only worship you.

967
01:52:27,568 --> 01:52:30,295
You are the most powerful one.

968
01:52:31,814 --> 01:52:34,195
You are my saviour.

969
01:52:36,094 --> 01:52:37,958
You make us smile.

970
01:52:38,096 --> 01:52:41,237
And fill our hearts with love.

971
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:44,827
All around the world.
In my heart.

972
01:52:45,655 --> 01:52:49,107
In my home. You are everywhere.

973
01:52:49,245 --> 01:52:53,939
In every root,
and every drop of water.

974
01:52:55,285 --> 01:52:59,013
With our eyes. With our ears.

975
01:52:59,151 --> 01:53:01,775
On our lips. We say your name.

976
01:53:03,224 --> 01:53:07,884
I sing your praise,
day and night.

977
01:53:20,034 --> 01:53:22,934
Oh God, I worship you.

978
01:53:42,712 --> 01:53:46,474
Oh God, I worship you.

979
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:35,487
One, two, three.
