1
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,691
你知道哈努曼的故事吗?
Do you know the story of Hanuman?

3
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,107
没有?
No?

4
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:15,247
看看这个。
Look at this.

5
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,526
看。
Look.

6
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:26,569
故事是这样的……当哈努曼还小的时候……很少的……他很饿。
The story goes... When Hanuman was little... Very little... He was very hungry.

7
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:28,157
所以饿了。
So hungry.

8
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,227
就像你一样!
Just like you!

9
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:35,164
他可以吃森林里的任何水果。
He could have eaten any fruit in the forest.

10
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:38,339
但有什么东西对他下了魔咒。
But something cast a spell on him.

11
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,894
高高在树之上。
High above the trees.

12
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:45,035
那是一个又大又多汁的芒果。
It was a big juicy mango.

13
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,761
所以闪亮。
So shiny.

14
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,419
看看这个。
Look at this.

15
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:50,972
你知道他做了什么吗?
Do you know what he did?

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,220
哈努曼飞上了天空。
Hanuman took to the skies.

17
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,845
径直走向那个水果。
Straight towards that fruit.

18
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:05,263
那个多汁的芒果。
That juicy mango.

19
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:07,713
所以闪亮。
So shiny.

20
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:20,140
却发现……那不是芒果，而是灼热的太阳。
Only to discover... that it wasn't a mango but the burning, hot sun.

21
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:25,248
众神听说了这件事……并聚集起来惩罚他。
The gods heard of this... and gathered to punish him.

22
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:34,706
他们给了他一个教训。剥夺了小哈努曼的能力
They taught him a lesson... and stripped young Hanuman of his powers.

23
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,193
然后发生了什么，妈妈?
And then what happened, Ma?

24
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:47,339
没有他妈的规则!
There are no fucking rules!

25
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:50,170
战斗!
Fight!

26
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,712
长官，老虎，长官。
Sir, Tiger, sir.

27
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,407
国王Kobra !国王Kobra !国王Kobra !
King Kobra! King Kobra! King Kobra!

28
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:59,273
老虎，我爱你!
Tiger, I love you!

29
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,826
国王Kobra !国王Kobra !
King Kobra! King Kobra!

30
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:05,659
国王Kobra !国王Kobra !国王Kobra !国王Kobra !
King Kobra! King Kobra! King Kobra! King Kobra!

31
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,350
哇!
Whoo!

32
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,421
-晚上好。
- Good evening.

33
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,699
这就是我要说的。
That's what I'm talking about.

34
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,943
欢迎来到老虎庙。
Welcome to Tiger's Temple.

35
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,635
这是一个神圣的地方。
This is a sacred space.

36
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,259
因为我们当中有些人是穆斯林。
Because some of us here are Muslim.

37
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:20,846
我们有些人是印度教徒。
Some of us are Hindu.

38
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:24,816
妈的，也许有个秘密的基督徒藏在椽子下面。
Fuck, maybe there's a closet Christian hiding somewhere there under the rafters.

39
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:31,788
但我们这里只崇拜一个神
But we here all worship one god:

40
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,756
印度卢比!
the Indian rupee!

41
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:48,909
胜利者，野兽的杀手，-科布拉国王!
The winner, the killer of the beast, - King Kobra!

42
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:51,808
看看这个疯子。看看这个。
Look at this maderchod. Look at this.

43
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:55,018
这就是胜利的味道。
That's the smell of victory right there.

44
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,435
-你闻到了吗?
- Do you smell it?

45
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,885
因为我他妈的闻到了!
'Cause I fucking smell it!

46
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,991
这是一个冠军。这是……
This is a champion. This is...

47
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,792
该死的，伙计们。多么美妙的一晚啊?
Fucking hell, guys. What a night, eh?

48
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:23,037
你听到了吗?他们恨死你了。
You hear that? They fucking hate you.

49
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,315
这是不可思议的。
It's incredible.

50
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:26,765
多么美好的夜晚。
What a night.

51
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,664
萨里珊，这是什么鬼肚子?
Sarishan, what's this fucking stomach?

52
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:32,530
太多萨莫萨了。你是蜥蜴王，不是萨莫萨王，明白吗?
Too many samosas. You're the Lizard King, not the fucking Samosa King, okay?

53
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:34,186
这该死的水龙头!
This fucking tap!

54
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,913
阿齐兹，我手上的水龙头又掉了。
Aziz, the fucking tap came off in my hands again, man.

55
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:37,811
到这里来。
Come here.

56
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,640
看这里。那是什么?
Look here. What's that?

57
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,677
那他妈一直开着。你知道我为此要付多少水费吗?
That fucking stays on. You know what my water bill is for that?

58
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:42,850
把该死的水龙头修好。请。
Fix the fucking tap. Please.

59
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,645
阿齐兹，把它修好，兄弟。请。
Aziz, just fix it, brother. Please.

60
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:46,198
我他妈只要一点干净的地方。
I ask just for a little bit of fucking cleanliness.

61
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,166
注意一点个人卫生。是的,什么?
A little bit of personal hygiene. Yes, what?

62
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:51,134
-是的。好吧。
- Yeah. All right.

63
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:54,275
别一下子花光了，好吗?
Don't spend it all at once, eh?

64
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,451
老虎。老虎，这是一半。
Tiger. Tiger, this is half.

65
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,039
怎么啦？这是你上次得到的。
What? That's what you got last time.

66
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,455
怎么，你存钱是为了找个更好的地方住吗?
What, are you saving for a better place to live?

67
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,939
你想要另外50%，你就得流血。
You want another 50%, you bleed.

68
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,528
这就是为什么它被称为流血奖励。
That's why it's called the bleed bonus.

69
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,083
我需要那笔钱。
I need that money.

70
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,915
然后跳舞。
Then dance.

71
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:15,227
别那样看着我。
Don't look at me like that.

72
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:16,539
你选的名字。
You chose the name.

73
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:21,302
你就像那些小猴子，你知道，在市场上…穿着粉红色的小裙子。
You're like those little monkeys, you know, in the marketplace that go... with a little pink skirt.

74
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,718
这是你的。
That's you.

75
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,029
上演一出戏，拿到钱。
Put on a show, get the money.

76
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:31,036
有成百上千的人会做这件事，嗯——成百上千——等着取代你的位置，如果你不适合做这件事的话。
There's hundreds of folks out there that'll do this, eh-- hundreds-- waiting to take your place if this isn't for you.

77
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,939
永生，获得不朽。
To live eternal, and gain immortality.

78
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:38,941
神的神圣礼物，来自巴巴沙克提。
A sacred gift of the Gods, from Baba Shakti.

79
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,012
爸爸生命力。
Baba Shakti.

80
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,049
大师，和平之人，国家的雄狮。
Guru, man of peace, the nation's lion.

81
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:46,776
出身贫寒，却不为贫寒所困。
Born to poverty but not held captive by it.

82
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:54,991
事实上，Baba Shakti现在更可能出现在精英的寺庙里，而不是在众神的寺庙里，与有钱有势的人擦肩而过。
Indeed, Baba Shakti is now likely to be seen in the temples of the elite than at the temples of the gods, rubbing shoulders with the rich and powerful.

83
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:00,065
这些都是一个人的简单行为吗?我把政治留给政治家。
Are these the simple actions of a man made good... I leave politics to the politicians.

84
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:05,381
…还是通过支持有争议的主权党开始推动政治权力?
...or the start of a push for political power through his endorsement of the controversial Sovereign Party?

85
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,075
如果我看到一个敬畏上帝的人在为印度做好事，我会支持他。
If I see a God-fearing man who is doing good for India, I will support him.

86
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:14,390
他否认了有关他的工厂……幸运仔，最近怎么样?
He has dismissed rumors that his factory... Lucky, how's things?

87
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,530
头等舱，兄弟。
First class, bro.

88
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,843
老板，给他来份芒果奶油冻。
Boss, get him a Mango Frooti.

89
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,017
嗯!要双份的。
Eh! Make it a double.

90
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,572
所以呢?
So?

91
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,616
幸运，幸运，幸运。
Lucky, Lucky, Lucky.

92
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,590
这就是你想要的人。
This is who you want.

93
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:44,489
奎妮·卡普尔，万王之王。
Queenie Kapoor, the queen of Kings.

94
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:50,702
星期五下午，她在Body Tonic做了按摩和足疗。
Friday afternoon, she had a massage and pedicure at Body Tonic.

95
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,741
大多数早晨，她都会在意大利咖啡馆停下来喝咖啡。
Most of the mornings, she stops at a Café d'Italia for coffee.

96
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,466
——环意大利自行车赛”?-是的。
- D'Italia? - Yeah.

97
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,986
她明天会在那里。
She'll be there tomorrow.

98
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,471
但祝你从她嘴里套出什么来。
But good luck getting anything out of her.

99
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,887
她真是个狠角色。
She's a real hard-ass.

100
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,271
-阿育吠陀智慧-好的。
-Ayurvedic wisdom - Okay.

101
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,929
-已经有几千年的历史了。-干得好。
- is thousands of years old. - Good job.

102
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,208
我们凭什么质疑诸神?
Who are we to question the gods?

103
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:20,318
毗湿奴，拉克希米，湿婆!50卢比。
Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva! For fifty rupees.

104
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:25,012
——是的。-在餐桌上，这就像一个口头契约。
- Yes. - On the dinner table, it was like a verbal contract.

105
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:29,430
我没有邮件。
I don't have any mail.

106
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,709
求你了，夫人，我两天没吃东西了。
Please, madam, I haven't eaten in two days.

107
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,296
求你了，求你了，夫人。
Please, please, madam.

108
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:36,299
-拜托，拜托，夫人。
- Please, please, madam.

109
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:41,960
——我……噢!-我的天啊。你怎么能让这些人进来?
- I'm... Ow! - Oh, my God. How can you allow these guys here?

110
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:43,962
你经营的是什么地方?

警察!
Police!

551
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:31,295
这是最后一次警告!
This is your last warning!

552
00:51:35,264 --> 00:51:36,990
看到目标了。
Target in sight.

553
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,619
我只崇拜你。
I only worship you.

554
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:56,759
你是最强大的。
You are the most powerful one.

555
00:52:56,897 --> 00:52:58,071
你是我的救世主。
You are my saviour.

556
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,384
慢慢地，慢慢地，慢慢地。然后呢?
Slowly, slowly, slowly. And then?

557
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:01,764
你让我们用爱微笑。
You make us smile with love.

558
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:03,835
- - - ?-保守我们的心脱离罪恶。
- And? - Keep our hearts free from sin.

559
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:05,009
真的很好!
Really good!

560
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,045
我们要带一些回家吗?
Should we take some of these home?

561
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,219
是的,好的。
Yes, ok.

562
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:10,394
我用这个给你做酸辣酱。
I will make you chutney with this.

563
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:14,812
看看这些根，多结实啊。
Look at these roots and how strong they are.

564
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:18,091
你认为他们会去哪里?
Where do you think they go?

565
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:20,921
-我不知道。-在地下深处。
- I don't know. - Deep below the ground.

566
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:24,787
树根又是怎样从地里长出来的呢?
And how do the roots grow from the ground?

567
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:28,343
让我看看你的。
Show me yours.

568
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:31,760
这是第一个根。
This is the first root.

569
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:32,968
这是二次根。
This is the second root.

570
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:34,625
这是三次方根。
And this is the third root.

571
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:41,425
所以，我们的手也有根……它们告诉我们将来要做什么。
So, our hands also have roots... They tell us what we'll do in the future.

572
00:53:41,563 --> 00:53:43,530
你将来会做什么?
What will you do in the future?

573
00:53:44,669 --> 00:53:45,670
嗯…
Um...

574
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,826
你是好的。
You're okay.

575
00:54:37,964 --> 00:54:40,311
你是好的。
You're okay.

576
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,011
你是醒着的。
You're awake.

577
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:28,428
最后。
Finally.

578
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:32,950
美丽。
Beautiful.

579
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:35,608
不是她?
Isn't she?

580
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,200
Parvati和Shiva。
Parvati and Shiva.

581
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:48,379
一半是奉献，一半是毁灭。
One half devotion, the other destruction.

582
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,692
男性。
Male.

583
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:53,764
女性。
Female.

584
00:55:53,902 --> 00:55:55,317
既不。
Neither.

585
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:57,802
两者都有。
Both.

586
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:05,879
一些人发现……奇怪。
Some people find that... strange.

587
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:11,678
但是我们海吉拉完全理解。
But we hijras understand it completely.

588
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:15,061
你是谁?
Who are you?

589
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:20,031
我是阿尔法，神庙的守护者。
I'm Alpha, the keeper of the temple.

590
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,795
——小心!小心!
- Careful! Careful!

591
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:34,667
你为什么帮我?
Why did you help me?

592
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:38,049
你应该死于那些伤。
You should've died from those injuries.

593
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:42,433
诸神对你一定有更伟大的安排。
The gods must have a greater plan for you.

594
00:56:44,573 --> 00:56:47,611
我们都有伤疤。
We all have scars.

595
00:56:51,718 --> 00:56:53,651
我该走了。
I should go.

596
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,757
不。我不会那么做的。
No. I wouldn't do that.

597
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:58,104
警察正在找你。
The police are looking for you.

598
00:56:58,242 --> 00:56:59,864
到处都是。
All over town.

599
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:02,177
但不是在这里。
But not here.

600
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:08,942
他们也会找到我们……令人不安。
They find us too... unsettling.

601
00:57:11,048 --> 00:57:13,015
别走开。
Stay with us.

602
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:14,983
休息。
Rest.

603
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,848
你需要疗伤。
You need to heal.

604
00:57:21,092 --> 00:57:24,026
也许她会跟你说话。
Maybe she'll speak to you.

605
00:57:31,655 --> 00:57:34,209
生命力!生命力!生命力!
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

606
00:57:34,347 --> 00:57:38,213
生命力!生命力!生命力!生命力!
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

607
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:41,319
生命力!生命力!生命力!
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

608
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,220
生命力!生命力!生命力!生命力!
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

609
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:47,878
生命力!生命力!生命力!
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

610
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:53,055
生命力!生命力!生命力!生命力!生命力!
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

611
00:58:09,624 --> 00:58:11,902
他是谁?
Who is he?

612
00:58:13,144 --> 00:58:14,939
他是个无名小卒。
He's a nobody.

613
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:18,218
只是个来自贫民区的疯孩子。
Just some crazy kid from the gutter.

614
00:58:18,356 --> 00:58:21,359
人们曾经这么说过我。
People once said that about me.

615
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,500
现在看看你。
And now look at you.

616
00:58:23,638 --> 00:58:26,157
你是国家的雄狮。
You're the nation's lion.

617
00:58:28,056 --> 00:58:30,817
你说他提到了他母亲。
You said he spoke of his mother.

618
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:37,583
别为他担心……他是个行尸走肉。
Don't worry about him... He's a walking corpse.

619
00:58:39,274 --> 00:58:49,664
Rana……在生命的巨幅挂毯上，一个小小的余烬可以烧毁一切。
Rana... in the great tapestry of life, just one small ember can burn down everything.

620
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:55,877
关于他的想法必须被消灭。
The very idea of him has to be extinguished.

621
00:58:57,603 --> 00:58:59,052
找到他。
Find him.

622
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:03,125
在你的无名小卒成为大人物之前。
Before your nobody becomes a somebody.

623
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:18,175
破坏之路始于一名恐怖分子企图谋杀亚塔纳的警察局长拉纳·辛格(Rana Singh)，此人伪装成警察的工作人员。
The trail of destruction started with a murder attempt on Yatana's chief of police, Rana Singh, by a terrorist posing as a member of staff.

624
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:23,387
全市范围内正在搜捕这名恐怖分子及其同伙。
A citywide manhunt is underway for the terrorist and his known associates.

625
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:30,014
即将到来的选举在该国最吉祥的日子举行，安全措施已经提高。
Security has been raised for the upcoming elections, which are occurring on the country's most auspicious day.

626
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:12,160
-谢谢。所以,呃…这是一对夫妻的故事……的丈夫。
- Thank you. -So, uh... This one is a story of husband and wife... Husband.

627
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:14,300
和妻子。
And wife.

628
01:00:33,215 --> 01:00:35,839
-现在他们没事了。
- Now they are okay.

629
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:40,947
但是…
But...

630
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:55,444
这就是她和牧师私奔的原因。
And that is why she ran away with the priest.

631
01:01:07,836 --> 01:01:09,735
有趣的,是吗?
Funny, huh?

632
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:33,482
还是睡不着?
Still can't sleep?

633
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,452
我从不睡觉。
I never sleep.

634
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,973
你脑子里的声音?
Voices in your head?

635
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:44,217
只有一个。
Just one.

636
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:48,877
她的尖叫。
Her scream.

637
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:54,089
它一直在我体内。
It's been inside me my whole life.

638
01:01:58,818 --> 01:02:00,855
跟我来。
Come with me.

639
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:35,510
在他们把我们流放到这里之前，我们是战士。
We were warriors before they drove us into exile here.

640
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:47,798
《吠陀经》中提到了一棵据说是世界毁灭者湿婆神种下的树。
The Vedas speak of a tree that was supposedly planted by Lord Shiva, the destroyer of worlds.

641
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,926
我曾经和你一样。
I was once like you.

642
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,514
一个破碎的人。
A broken man.

643
01:03:16,344 --> 01:03:19,243
童年恐惧的奴隶。
A slave to childhood terrors.

644
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,525
我明白了为了成长，你需要毁灭。
I learned that you need to destroy in order to grow.

645
01:03:26,664 --> 01:03:29,046
为新生活创造空间。
To create space for new life.

646
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:39,125
嗯，开始吧。
Mm. Here we go.

647
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,336
它的根部含有一种强大的毒素。
Within its root lies a potent toxin.

648
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:47,168
我们用湿婆的三叉戟命名它为Trishul。
We call it Trishul after Shiva's trident.

649
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,999
它会把你切开。
It will cut you open.

650
01:03:52,483 --> 01:03:57,972
只有虚弱的人才能从中受益。
Only a weakened man can benefit from this.

651
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:02,562
只有强壮的人才能活下来。
Only a strong man can survive it.

652
01:04:05,082 --> 01:04:07,188
你准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

653
01:04:08,672 --> 01:04:10,329
是的。
Yes.

654
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:34,249
痛苦……一旦教会了你，它就会离开你。
The pain... It will leave you once it's finished teaching you.

655
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,915
兄弟姐妹们!
Brothers and Sisters!

656
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:05,297
欢迎来到罗摩衍那的故事。
Welcome to the tale of the Ramayana.

657
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:07,644
每一代人都在重复这样的故事。
In each generation, the story repeats itself.

658
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:16,239
被俘的公主……还有她和魔王的战斗。
The captive Princess... And her fight with the Demon King.

659
01:07:17,964 --> 01:07:19,173
我Ravan !
I'm Ravan!

660
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:22,900
邪恶的国王，请放了我。
Evil King, please let me go.

661
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,488
没人对我说不!
Nobody says no to me!

662
01:07:28,665 --> 01:07:30,218
但后来!
But then!

663
01:07:30,356 --> 01:07:31,668
然后大能者来了!
And then came the mighty one!

664
01:07:31,806 --> 01:07:33,842
-妈妈，那是哈努曼!-是的。
- Mum, that's Hanuman! - Yes, it is.

665
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,913
接受我棍棒的第一击。
Take the first blow of my club.

666
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,169
感受我猴子的力量!
Feel my monkey strength!

667
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,620
我长尾猴!
I'm Hanuman!

668
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:03,251
说话。
Speak.

669
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:06,841
加油，拉纳，加油。
Go Rana, go.

670
01:08:07,531 --> 01:08:10,293
是时候做上帝的工作了。
Time to do God's work.

671
01:08:22,822 --> 01:08:25,308
他们回来。警察回来了。
They're back. The Police are back.

672
01:08:25,446 --> 01:08:27,758
起床了。运行时,每一个人。
Get up. Run, everyone.

673
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:30,140
快点,快点。
Hurry, hurry.

674
01:08:30,278 --> 01:08:32,522
快跑!我们必须撤离。是警察。
Run! We must evacuate. It's the Police.

675
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:06,935
听我说。
Listen to me.

676
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:10,076
你上楼躲起来。不要发出声音。
You go upstairs and hide. And don't make a sound.

677
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,148
不不，听我说。听我说。
No, no, listen to me. Listen to me.

678
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:15,151
上楼躲起来。不要发出任何声音。
Go upstairs and hide. And don't even make a slight sound.

679
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:16,497
但是你呢?
But what about you?

680
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:18,084
我不会有事的。
Nothing will happen to me.

681
01:09:18,223 --> 01:09:19,603
就像老鼠躲起来一样?
Like how a mouse hides?

682
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:22,296
你像老鼠一样躲起来，不出声。
You hide like a mouse and make no sound.

683
01:09:22,434 --> 01:09:23,607
你相信妈妈吗?
Do you trust Mum?

684
01:09:23,745 --> 01:09:25,161
你相信我吗?
Do you trust me?

685
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:26,645
什么也不会发生。
Nothing will happen.

686
01:09:26,783 --> 01:09:29,234
什么也不会发生。不要灰心。
Nothing will happen. Don't lose heart.

687
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:30,856
不要灰心。
Don't lose heart.

688
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,513
你是我的哈努曼。
You are my Hanuman.

689
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:35,723
很快。
Quickly.

690
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,867
很快,很快。
Quickly, quickly.

691
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:06,823
你建立了一个温馨的家。
You've built a sweet home.

692
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,965
你在外面说什么?
What were you saying outside?

693
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:14,520
嗯?
Huh?

694
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:17,074
把那些文件塞进你的屁股。
Shove those papers up your ass.

695
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,317
对吗?
Is that right?

696
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:42,721
该死的婊子!
Bloody whore!

697
01:10:44,826 --> 01:10:46,897
你要把它塞进我屁股里?
You'll shove it up my ass, huh?

698
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:50,246
我示范给你看。
I'll show you.

699
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:51,592
起来，婊子。
Get up, bitch.

700
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:07,866
我辜负了她。
I failed her.

701
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:12,180
不。
No.

702
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:16,046
你想救她。
You tried to save her.

703
01:13:20,085 --> 01:13:21,983
你会看到伤疤。
You see scars.

704
01:13:24,089 --> 01:13:28,611
我看到了一个孩子为救母亲而奋斗的勇气。
I see the courage of a child fighting to save his mother.

705
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:37,343
这是一个注定要挑战众神的战士的双手。
These are the hands of a warrior who's destined to challenge the gods.

706
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,348
你一生都在努力感受痛苦。
All your life, you've been fighting to feel pain.

707
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:45,973
你需要为一个目标而奋斗。
You need to fight for a purpose.

708
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:51,392
战斗……为了我们所有人。
Fight... for all of us.

709
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:56,570
是时候记起你是谁了。
It's time to remember who you are.

710
01:14:04,163 --> 01:14:13,241
随着主权党在民意调查中的支持率攀升，有指控称你破坏了200英亩林地来建造你的大型工厂。
As the Sovereign Party climbs in the polls, allegations have surfaced that you destroyed 200 acres of forestland to build your mega factory.

711
01:14:13,379 --> 01:14:14,691
它不是工厂。
It's not a factory.

712
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:16,106
这是一个公社。
It's a commune.

713
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:19,903
那些流离失所的农民怎么办?
And what about the farmers that have been displaced?

714
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:21,595
啊。
Ah.

715
01:14:21,733 --> 01:14:24,252
这片土地贫瘠而空旷。
The land was barren and empty.

716
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:28,084
住在那里的家庭很少加入这项事业。
Few families who lived there have joined the cause.

717
01:14:28,222 --> 01:14:32,260
那些抱怨工作环境恶劣的工人呢?
And workers who complain of horrible working conditions?

718
01:14:32,398 --> 01:14:34,331
他们不是工人。
They aren't workers.

719
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,610
他们是我的门徒。
They are my disciples.

720
01:16:19,644 --> 01:16:21,956
-是的。
- Yeah.

721
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,700
嗯。
Hmm.

722
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:50,778
啊。
Ah.

723
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,360
起床了。
Get up.

724
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:31,750
在阿德什·乔希(Adesh Joshi)发表分裂言论后，全国各地爆发了教派暴力事件。
A surge of sectarian violence has exploded around the country after divisive remarks made by Adesh Joshi.

725
01:17:31,888 --> 01:17:41,760
国际领导人谴责针对少数民族的暴力行为，但没有批评这位在民意调查中攀升的候选人。
International leaders have condemned the violence against minorities but have stopped short of criticizing the candidate as he climbs in the polls.

726
01:18:13,205 --> 01:18:22,559
闭上眼睛，你会发现自己正坐在一棵高大的树上。
Close your eyes, and you will find yourself sitting atop a mighty tree.

727
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,701
这是你的家。
This is your home.

728
01:18:25,839 --> 01:18:28,324
你是一头野兽。
You are a beast.

729
01:18:29,049 --> 01:18:38,299
透过表面看下去，你会看到土壤深处的根，延伸得又远又广。
Look beneath the surface, and you will see roots deep under the soil, reaching far and wide.

730
01:18:38,437 --> 01:18:43,684
这是你祖先的根，是你母亲的灵魂。
These are the roots of your ancestors, the soul of your mother.

731
01:18:43,822 --> 01:18:45,824
听她的。
Listen to her.

732
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,654
你没什么好害怕的。
You have nothing to fear.

733
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:51,416
你在这里已经很久了。
You've been here for time.

734
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:09,883
Yatana的人们... ...巴巴生命力!
People of Yatana... ...Baba Shakti!

739
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:22,378
我什么都不是。
I am nobody.

740
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:24,690
我什么都不是。
I am nothing.

741
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:26,416
我没有选择这条路。
I didn't choose this path.

742
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:29,903
-你为我选的。
- You chose it for me.

743
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:33,216
没有斗争，变革就不会到来。
Change never comes without a fight.

744
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:39,533
我要你再选一个上帝的人。
I want you to choose another of God's men.

745
01:19:40,603 --> 01:19:47,921
他是我们中的一员。他就是主权党领袖Adesh Joshi。
He's one of us. He is Adesh Joshi, leader of Sovereign Party.

746
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:53,789
他会和我们一起战斗，为了我们，为了你们。
He will fight with us, for us, for you.

747
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:59,656
工人，穷人，病人。
The working man, the poor, the sick.

748
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:08,044
用你的爱浇灌他，让我们的声音传遍全国。
Shower him with your love and let our voice be heard throughout the nation.

749
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:18,089
他们摧毁了我们神圣的价值观。
They have destroyed our sacred values.

750
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:24,267
他们偷走了我们的家园，毒害了我们孩子的心灵。
They have stolen our homes, poisoned our children's minds.

751
01:20:25,544 --> 01:20:31,171
他们用他们的象征，他们虚假的偶像玷污了我们。
They have polluted us with their symbols, their false idols.

752
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:33,483
我们被蒙蔽了双眼。
We have been blinded.

753
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:36,279
你会和我们站在一起吗?
Will you stand with us?

754
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,868
你愿意和我们一起流血吗?
Will you bleed with us?

755
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,975
你会吗?
Will you?

756
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:43,424
你会吗?
Will you?

757
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:49,120
印度母亲的胜利。
Victory for Mother India.

758
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:57,991
印度母亲的胜利!
Victory for Mother India!

759
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,532
拉克希米!

760
01:21:25,466 --> 01:21:27,537
告诉我拉克希米怎么了。
Tell me what happened to Lakshmi.

761
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,367
——拉!——拉!

762
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:31,369
——拉克希米。-你没事吧，拉克希米?
- Lakshmi. - Are you okay, Lakshmi?

763
01:21:31,507 --> 01:21:32,888
发生了什么事?发生了什么事?
What happened? What happened?

764
01:21:33,026 --> 01:21:35,373
这些人在门上贴了一张告示。
These men put a notice on the door.

765
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:37,858
她想把它取下来，但他们打了她。
She tried to take it down, but they beat her.

766
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:40,378
她没有呼吸了。呼吸，拉克希米，呼吸。
She's not breathing. Breathe, Lakshmi, breathe.

767
01:21:40,516 --> 01:21:42,000
你看到了吗?你看到是谁了吗?
Did you see? Did you see who it was?

768
01:21:42,138 --> 01:21:43,450
生命力的男人。
Shakti's men.

769
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:46,039
他们说神庙从来不属于我们。
They said the temple never belonged to us.

770
01:21:46,177 --> 01:21:48,489
阿尔法，我们去哪?
Alpha, where will we go?

771
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:51,320
如果我们没有钱，他们会继续这样做。

772
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:54,979
我们不能收买那些暴徒。
We cannot pay off some thugs.

773
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:57,705
我们都必须祈祷。

774
01:21:57,843 --> 01:21:59,535
拉克希米!
Lakshmi!

These were carved by a devout follower who wore them to prevent his feet from harming any small creature.

945

在这一边，有一个古老的祈祷:
On the side here, there's an old prayer:
