3
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,946
Do you know the story of Hanuman?

4
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,115
No?

5
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,284
Look at this.

6
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,746
Look.

7
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,748
The story goes...

8
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,792
When Hanuman was little...

9
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,293
Very little...

10
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,796
He was very hungry.

11
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,506
So hungry.

12
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:29,590
Just like you!

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,513
He could have eaten any fruit
in the forest.

14
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,390
But something cast a spell on him.

15
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,186
High above the trees.

16
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,356
It was a big juicy mango.

17
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,899
So shiny.

18
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,819
Look at this.

19
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,320
Do you know what he did?

20
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:57,243
Hanuman took to the skies.

21
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,122
Straight towards that fruit.

22
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,292
That juicy mango.

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,837
So shiny.

24
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,133
Only to discover...

25
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,927
that it wasn't a mango

26
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:20,140
but the burning, hot sun.

27
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,102
The gods heard of this...

28
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,271
and gathered to punish him.

29
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,608
They taught him a lesson...

30
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,822
and stripped young Hanuman of his powers.

31
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,201
And then what happened, Ma?

32
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,696
Aziz, just fix it, brother. Please.

33
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:37,374
To live eternal, and gain immortality.

34
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,376
A sacred gift of the Gods,
from Baba Shakti.

35
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,703
Lucky, how's things?

36
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,249
Boss, get him a Mango Frooti.

37
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,792
But good luck getting anything out of her.

38
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,960
She's a real hard-ass.

39
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:20,811
Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva! For fifty rupees.

40
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,072
Please, madam,
I haven't eaten in two days.

41
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,484
Take it and go.

42
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,415
Once more.

43
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,335
Oh God, I worship you.

44
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,047
I only worship you.

45
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,591
You are the most powerful one.

46
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,010
You are my saviour.

47
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,931
I only worship you.

48
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:14,688
You make us smile
and fill our hearts with love.

49
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,566
With our eyes, with our ears.

50
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,610
On our lips, we say your name.

51
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,115
I sing your praise, day and night.

52
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,120
I worship you.

53
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,317
One regular paan.

54
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,623
And a Raju Special.

55
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,131
Lion!

56
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,924
Yes.

57
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,926
Take him.

58
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,469
Can I go on his shoulders?

59
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,596
How about a rickshaw, little bastard?
Take him!

60
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,975
Solid.

61
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,893
Come.

62
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,751
What you got?

63
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,422
Get inside.

64
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,218
You want to go back to selling your ass
on the street for 500 rupees?

65
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,470
I brought you in,
and this is how you repay me?

66
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,183
Don't cry.

67
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,812
As soon as Dr. Irani's back,
we'll take care of it.

68
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,662
I made you! Now you think you can
sit on my shoulders and piss in my ear?

69
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,363
Hey, new guy...

70
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,573
You know what happens
to earwigs around here?

71
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,367
You hear nothing, you see nothing. Got it?

72
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,538
Nothing will happen. Don't lose heart.

73
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,961
This land is now declared a holy site.

74
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,880
You must vacate immediately!

75
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,550
This land belongs to our ancestors.

76
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,136
Tell him to shove these papers up his ass!

77
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,388
Our blood is in the soil!

78
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,057
We will never give you this land.

79
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,017
We will never give you this land!

80
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,601
Hey, Alphonso. Show us your leg.

81
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,064
Fucker tried to run from a drug deal,

82
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,774
so they chopped it off.

83
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,651
Isn't that right?

84
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,361
Tell me one thing.

85
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,280
Your dick still works, huh?

86
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,034
He doesn't need one. He's got no balls.

87
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,122
Fuck off, go get my maal now.

88
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,336
Gimme a towel, asshole.

89
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,554
What the fuck is this?

90
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,309
Blessings from my mother.

91
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,245
I hope your mother fucks harder
than you fight.

92
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,758
Rasul! Where the fuck are you?

93
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,343
The attacker is in the parking lot!

94
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,115
Wake up, asshole!

95
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:12,669
Stop the car now!

96
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,501
Run away from here!

97
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,462
Police!

98
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,339
This is your last warning!

99
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,047
I only worship you.

100
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,008
You are the most powerful one.

101
00:52:57,008 --> 00:52:58,384
You are my saviour.

102
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,761
Slowly, slowly, slowly. And then?

103
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,221
You make us smile with love.

104
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,098
- And?
- Keep our hearts free from sin.

105
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,182
Really good!

106
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,351
Should we take some of these home?

107
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,436
Yes, ok.

108
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,438
I will make you chutney with this.

109
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:14,942
Look at these roots
and how strong they are.

110
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,321
Where do you think they go?

111
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,115
- I don't know.
- Deep below the ground.

112
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:24,911
And how do the roots grow from the ground?

113
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:28,372
Show me yours.

114
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,001
This is the first root.

115
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:33,252
This is the second root.

116
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,046
And this is the third root.

117
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:39,258
So, our hands also have roots...

118
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,802
They tell us what we'll do in the future.

119
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,596
What will you do in the future?

120
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,012
Don't worry about him...

121
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,598
He's a walking corpse.

122
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:11,317
This one is a story of husband and wife...

123
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,401
Husband.

124
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:14,528
And wife.

125
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,228
Brothers and Sisters!

126
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,689
Welcome to the tale of the Ramayana.

127
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,899
In each generation,
the story repeats itself.

128
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:13,989
The captive Princess...

129
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:16,616
And her fight with the Demon King.

130
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,536
I'm Ravan!

131
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:23,206
Evil King, please let me go.

132
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,624
Nobody says no to me!

133
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,589
But then!

134
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:32,132
And then came the mighty one!

135
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,134
- Mum, that's Hanuman!
- Yes, it is.

136
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,219
Take the first blow of my club.

137
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,525
Feel my monkey strength!

138
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,736
I'm Hanuman!

139
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:03,288
Speak.

140
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:07,000
Go Rana, go.

141
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,670
Time to do God's work.

142
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,685
They're back. The Police are back.

143
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,896
Get up. Run, everyone.

144
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,482
Hurry, hurry.

145
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:32,943
Run! We must evacuate. It's the Police.

146
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,143
Listen to me.

147
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,397
You go upstairs and hide.
And don't make a sound.

148
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:12,691
No, no, listen to me. Listen to me.

149
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:15,485
Go upstairs and hide.
And don't even make a slight sound.

150
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,903
But what about you?

151
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,405
Nothing will happen to me.

152
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:20,031
Like how a mouse hides?

153
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,659
You hide like a mouse and make no sound.

154
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:23,827
Do you trust Mum?

155
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,495
Do you trust me?

156
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:29,583
Nothing will happen. Don't lose heart.

157
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:31,126
Don't lose heart.

158
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:32,586
You are my Hanuman.

159
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:35,839
Quickly.

160
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:42,012
Quickly, quickly.

161
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,953
You've built a sweet home.

162
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:11,124
What were you saying outside?

163
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:17,380
Shove those papers up your ass.

164
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,673
Is that right?

165
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:42,822
Bloody whore!

166
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,035
You'll shove it up my ass, huh?

167
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,580
I'll show you.

168
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,998
Get up, bitch.

169
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,512
Get up.

170
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,512
Victory for Mother India.

171
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:58,020
Victory for Mother India!

172
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:43,944
Hail the mighty one!

173
01:43:40,256 --> 01:43:42,008
Get up, motherfucker!

174
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:52,101
You son of a whore.

175
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:55,521
What are you looking at?

176
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:05,610
Get up!

177
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:23,946
Oh God, I worship you.

178
01:52:24,697 --> 01:52:26,907
I only worship you.

179
01:52:27,783 --> 01:52:30,411
You are the most powerful one.

180
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:34,290
You are my saviour.

181
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:38,335
You make us smile.

182
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:41,672
And fill our hearts with love.

183
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:44,842
All around the world. In my heart.

184
01:52:45,885 --> 01:52:49,513
In my home. You are everywhere.

185
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:53,976
In every root, and every drop of water.

186
01:52:55,644 --> 01:52:59,398
With our eyes. With our ears.

187
01:52:59,398 --> 01:53:01,775
On our lips. We say your name.

188
