Hi, Maile.

33
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:30,659
Hi, Eddie.

34
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,160
I thought maybe
you were mad at me.

35
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,662
I haven't had to
chase you for a week.

36
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:34,663
Now, Eddie...

37
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:37,165
Sorry. You're not going
to talk me out of it.

38
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,134
But I'm in a big hurry.
It is important.

39
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,669
How many times
do I have to warn you?

40
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,170
If you fly now,
you'll pay later.

41
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:44,172
Please, no lectures.
I'm late.

42
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,674
Chad's coming home.

43
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,677
Chad?
Home from Europe?

44
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,678
His plane's probably
landing at the airport

45
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,680
right now.

46
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,181
Follow me.
Let's don't keep the soldier waiting.

47
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,683
Oh, thank you, Eddie.

48
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,724
Thanks, Eddie! Bye!

49
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:43,231
Hi, Wahilla.

50
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:45,234
Hello, Maile. You got
passengers coming in?

51
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,235
Just one. Chad's
out of the Army.

52
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:49,237
Chad? Here,
with my compliments.

53
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:50,238
Oh, <i>mahalo.</i>

54
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,241
United Airlines flight
now arriving

55
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,244
at United Airlines ramp.

56
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,768
Oh, Wahilla,
I think I'm scared.

57
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,270
He's been gone
for 2 years.

58
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:23,772
What if he's changed?

59
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,774
Just be patient
with him.

60
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,275
Some boys need time

61
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:29,778
to get adjusted
to being back home.

62
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:39,788
Some of them get
the hang of it right away.

63
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,289
Hi, Maile.

64
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,791
Hi, Wahilla.

65
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,293
Hi, Chad.

66
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:47,796
It worked.
She's jealous.

67
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:49,297
She should be.

68
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:51,299
Please, come along.

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,301
Get going, will you?
Move along.

70
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,303
He's been in the
service overseas.

71
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:56,805
For 2 years,
I was there.

72
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,306
I was over 3 years,

73
00:05:58,307 --> 00:05:59,808
but all I got
when I came back

74
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:01,309
was coffee and donuts.

75
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,310
Excuse me, sir.

76
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:03,311
Thanks again.

77
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:04,313
Thank <i>you.</i>

78
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:06,815
Maile.

79
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,316
I'd welcome you home,

80
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:09,818
but I'm not speaking
to you.

81
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:10,820
Hey!

82
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:16,825
I was only having
some fun.

83
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,326
I saw you.

84
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,328
You knew I'd be
waiting for you.

85
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,330
How could you
kiss that girl?

86
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,332
It was easy.

87
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,335
I mean, you call
that a kiss?

88
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,340
<i>That's</i> a kiss.

89
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:35,343
My French blood tells me
to argue with you,

90
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:38,346
and my Hawaiian blood
tells me not to,

91
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:41,349
and they're really
battling it out inside of me.

92
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,353
I've never seen a more
beautiful battleground.

93
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,357
All right, soldier.
You win.

94
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,359
Yeah.

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,861
Welcome home.

96
00:06:56,866 --> 00:07:00,368
I wonder where he took
his basic training.

97
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:01,870
In Hawaii.

98
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,880
Sure you don't
want to drive?

99
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,381
It's still your car,
you know.

100
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,383
Uh-uh. No.
I'm fine right here.

101
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,886
You sure kept them both
in good shape.

102
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:18,887
Both?

103
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:20,889
Mm-hmm. Your body
and my car's.

104
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,890
<i>Pupule.</i>

105
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,892
I'll show you
who's crazy. Hit it!

106
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,401
Hey, what
are you doing?

107
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,903
I'm not going home now.

108
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:37,405
<i>Wikiwiki...</i>
To the beach.

109
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,426
I missed you, Maile.

110
00:07:58,427 --> 00:07:59,928
I missed you, too.

111
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,930
What were you doing
all that time

112
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:03,431
while I was
missing you?

113
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,433
Ahem.
Uh, being true to you.

114
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:06,435

115

Well, what are
we waiting for?

135
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,501
- Got your bathing suit?
- Uh-uh.

136
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,036
Don't worry about it.
I brought you one from Paris.

137
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:49,537
But I've got a job,
remember?

138
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,539
Not today.
It's a Hawaiian holiday.

139
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,041
Didn't your mother
ever tell you about hooky-hooky day?

140
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,043
Hooky-hooky.

141
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:57,046
Come on.

142
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,048
The old shack.

143
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,549
The boys really kept
it up, didn't they?

144
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,052
I used to think a lot
about this place.

145
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:06,055
I was afraid
it might change,

146
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:07,556
but it's still
beautiful.

147
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,058
Now, this is for me.

148
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:10,558
You're not going
to stay here.

149
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,060
Why not? I got
a roof over my head,

150
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,062
a cot, and a stove...

151
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:16,564
but you've got a beautiful house
in Kahala and a family.

152
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:18,566
Look, let's get this
over with.

153
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,068
All the time
I was overseas,

154
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,570
I got a letter from
my folks every week

155
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:24,572
reminding me
of my beautiful home

156
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,074
and my beautiful future

157
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,076
in my dad's beautiful
pineapple business.

158
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:29,577
And the more
they reminded me,

159
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,579
the more I knew
I couldn't come back

160
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,581
with the rest of my life
all laid out for me.

161
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:34,582
No, Maile.

162
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,584
It's too easy to fall
into a ready-made setup.

163
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,586
I got to do this
on my own. I got to do it myself.

164
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:40,088
Can't you
tell them that?

165
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:41,589
- I will!
- Good!

166
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,091
When the time
is right.

167
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:46,094
Please don't
take too much time.

168
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:48,596
I don't know how long
I can wait for you to grow up.

169
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,098
Oh, you're
a pretty fresh kid.

170
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:53,101
I think I'll
let you have one.

171
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:54,602
Why, you little...

172
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:55,603
so on, so forth,
and so on!

173
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:56,604
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

174
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,606
No, Chad, no!

175
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:00,609
No! Aah!

176
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,112
Aah!

177
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:06,615
Aah!

178
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,117
Oh!

179
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,139
Ha ha ha!

180
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,641
Ha ha! Ohh...

181
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:34,142
What's so funny?

182
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:36,144
I bought this dress
to welcome you home.

183
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,645
It's the first time
I've worn it.

184
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:38,646
You want to know
something?

185
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,649
On you, wet is
my favorite color.

186
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:48,657
Hi.

187
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,659
Hello there.
Where'd you come from?

188
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,162
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

189
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,167
Could I play
with you?

190
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,168
I think you're
a little young for this game.

191
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:03,171
If I get a girl,
can I play with you?

192
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,173
He's not as young
as I thought.

193
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:06,674
The game's over,
pal.

194
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,176
Maybe some
other time, OK?

195
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,178
Bye.

196
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,178
Bye.

197
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,180
What do you say
we go for a swim?

198
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:13,182
Might as well.

199
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:14,683
We can't dance.

200
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:20,189
The suit's in this bag.

201
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,198
- Ready?
- Almost.

202
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,200
Did you really
buy this in Paris?

203
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,202
The first 3-day pass
I had. How's it fit?

204
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:36,205
You tell me.

205
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,209
And, uh, wow.

206
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,711
Don't you think the sleeves
are a little long?

207
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,713
I used to dream of you
wearing a muumuu.

208
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:47,715
Well, if my grandmother
ever saw me in this,

209
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,218
she'd sew me up in
a muumuu... For life.

210
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,719
Don't you like it?

211
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,221
Oh, I love it.

212
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,223
And I thank you
for thinking of me.

213
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:56,724
Oh, I wasn't
thinking of you.

214
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,693
I was thinking of me.

215
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:21,172
Now can I play?

216
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,673
Can he play?

217
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:23,674
Ha ha ha!

218
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,176
Sure, kids. Later.

219
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,182
You said I can play.

220
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,184
Later.

221
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:56,207
Hey, it's Chad!
Maile!

222
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,709

feed you in the army?

what happened
to all your medals?

This is it.
This is all I got.

248
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,834
Hey, look at Duke!

249
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:05,336
Duke!

250
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:06,837

He looks great.
He looks great.

But he's still

Not yet!

00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,558
Hey, dig this
crazy seaweed.

313
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:48,059
That's no seaweed.

just stay right there!

Hey, he's bringing
a shirt out to her.

I told you.

That dog is just
plain stupid.

331
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:31,603
Bye.

332
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:34,105
Hello, Mr. Gates.

333
00:20:34,606 --> 00:20:36,106
Hello, Maile.

334
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:37,608
I'll come right
to the point.

335
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:38,609
Is my son here?

336
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,110
Chad? Here?

337
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,612
You know what I mean.

338
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:43,113
I've heard he's been
home for several days.

339
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:45,115
If this is true, I know
that you've seen him.

340
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:47,618
Well?

341
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,119
That's good enough
for me.

342
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,121
Chad's mother doesn't
know about this,

343
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:54,124
and I want him home
before she finds out.

344
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,626
If he doesn't
consider my feelings,

345
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,628
he does owe some
consideration to his mother.

346
00:20:57,629 --> 00:21:00,130
I leave it to you.

347
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:01,131
Good-bye, Maile.

348
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:02,633
Good-bye, Mr. Gates.

349
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:21,151
Hi, O'Hara.

350
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:22,152
Hi.

351
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:23,654
Don't you dig judo?

352
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,656
Man don't live
on muscles alone.

353
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,658
You got any ketchup
in that bag?

354
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,159
No, but I have
some lipstick.

355
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Same color.

356
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:31,662
Nah. Lipstick,
like, fattening.

357
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:33,664
<i>I'm</i> on a diet.

358
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:35,165
Oh, yeah.

359
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,667
Where's Chad?

360
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:38,168
Back in the briny.

361
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,120
It's just like
he never left.

362
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:41,672
Even though
there's no surf,

363
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:43,173
he's right back
in the swim.

364
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:45,676
Well, he's about
to be beached.

365
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,202
Well, it's about time
you got here.

366
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:14,705
I sneaked away half an hour
early as it is.

367
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,707
The fellas are playing
for a luau tonight at the outrigger.

368
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,208
I told them
to count us in.

369
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:20,711
Can't. The whole family's
meeting in Haleiwa tonight.

370
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:22,212
At your grandmother's?

371
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:24,214
It's her birthday.
She's 78.

372
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,716
Well, that's something
to celebrate.

373
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:27,217
Am I invited?

374
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:28,719
You're hiding out,
remember?

375
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,220
Not from <i>your</i> folks.

376
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,221
Yours, either.

377
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:32,222
Huh?

378
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:34,725
Your father came
to see me today.

379
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:38,729
He knows you're back.

380
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,181
You've got to go
home sometime. Why?

381
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:43,734
You can't spend
the rest of your life on a surfboard.

382
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:45,235
Oh, yes, I can.

383
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:47,237
The G.I. bill
of rights

384
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:49,239
says I get
my old job back.

385
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,741
This is my old job.

386
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:54,244
Like I said,
yankee, go home!

387
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,746
Hey, wait a...

388
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:57,247
Hey, wait!

389
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:59,250
I'll get you!

390
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:02,753
It's certainly nice
to have you here.

391
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:03,754
Thank you, Fred.

392
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:05,255
Oh, here we are.

393
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:08,258
Daddy, let's drink
a toast to your boss.

394
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,259
Aloha, Jack.

395
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Aloha.

396
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:11,261
Aloha, daddy.

397
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:12,263
Aloha.

398
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:16,266
You know,
every time I come here,

399
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:17,768
I feel like
a prize fool.

400
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,770
I've seen the latest
company statement

401
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,271
raising
the dividends.

402
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:22,272
You're no fool,
boss.

403
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:24,775
Oh, no? Then how come
I moved you here

404
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:26,777
and kept myself
on the mainland?

405
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:28,779
To your glorious
Hawaiian winters.

406
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
Aloha, Jack.

407
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:31,281
Aloha.

408
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:32,283
Aloha.

409
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,793
Missa Gates! Missa Gates!

410
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:44,795
Missa Gates! Missa Gates!
Missa Gates!

411
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:46,747
Missa Gates,
guess who here!

412
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:47,798
He's home!

413
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,299
Just drive up in car,
all the way from Army!

414
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Who?

415
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,802
Our boy Chadwick!

416
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:52,803
Chadwick!

417
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,805
Oh, daddy, Jack,
it's Chadwick!

418
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:56,807
My boy's home
from the war!

419
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:58,809
Sarah Lee, there
wasn't any war.

420
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:01,311
Well, don't just
stand there!

421
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:02,312
Aloha.

422
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:04,314
Chadwick?

423
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:05,816
Oh, Chadwick, my boy!

424
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:06,817
Hiya, Mom!

425
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:08,318
Welcome home, son.

426
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,319
Hi, Pop. Hey, Jack!

427
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,821
Didn't expect
to see you here.

428
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:11,822
Arrived yesterday.

429
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:12,823
Just checking up
on your old man.

430
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:13,824
You're looking
good, fella.

431
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:14,825
Thank you.

432
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,326
Ping Pong, will you
shut off that water?

433
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:17,828
Don't get wet.

434
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,832
Hello, Mr. Chadwick.

435
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,834
You have swinging
time in Europe?

436
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:26,336
Pingo,
the swingingest, boy.

437
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:27,337
How are you,
boy?

438
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:28,339
Hi, Jack. Hi, Pop.

439
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,280
Doesn't he look
marvelous in uniform?

440
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:31,341
Go get the camera,
daddy.

441
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:32,843
Later, Sarah Lee.
Later.

442
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,845
Come on in. We got
so much to talk about.

443
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:36,847
I have to get my bags, Mom.

444
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:38,849
Don't worry, Mr. Chadwick.
I get bags...

445
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:42,853
Aloha!

446
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:47,357
I got it!
I got it!

447
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:48,859
Ping Pong,

448
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,361
tell cook we'll let her know
when to start serving.

449
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:52,863
We want to talk
to our boy.

450
00:24:52,864 --> 00:24:54,364
<i>Oui, oui,</i>
missy.

451
00:24:54,365 --> 00:24:57,367
We must give
a welcome-home party for Chadwick, daddy,

452
00:24:57,368 --> 00:24:58,869
and it could be
for Jack, too.

453
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,370
Oh, forget about
me, Sarah Lee.

454
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:01,872
Just invite
Chad's friends.

455
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:04,374
You mean those nasty
little beach boys?

456
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,876
Oh, no. Now that
Chadwick's home,

457
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:07,878
I'm sure he's got
all that foolishness

458
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:10,380
out of his system...
After the war.

459
00:25:10,381 --> 00:25:11,381
Sarah Lee,

460
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:13,383
how many times do
I have to tell you,

461
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:14,885
he was not in a war.

462
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:16,386
Oh, I know
you're right, daddy,

463
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:18,889
but if I don't tell
myself there was a war,

464
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,891
I have a most
depressing feeling

465
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:22,893
Chadwick's
just wasted 2 years.

466
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:25,897
Chadwick, sweet boy.

467
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:28,899
Sure feels good to get
back into civvies, Mom.

468
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,901
Oh, why'd you take off
your soldier suit?

469
00:25:30,902 --> 00:25:32,402
You looked
so handsome in it,

470
00:25:32,403 --> 00:25:33,904
just like
Stonewall Jackson.

471
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:36,406
Hey, you got some sugar
for your mama?

472
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:38,408
How about a drink
before dinner, civilian?

473
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:39,910
Why don't you give him

474
00:25:39,911 --> 00:25:41,411
some of your
pineapple juice, Jack?

475
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:42,913
Missed it, huh, boy?

476
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:43,914
Yeah.

477
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:45,916
You should try
the new rum drink.

478
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:46,917
Jack...

479
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:48,919
Chadwick's
a growing boy, Fred,

480
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,421
and I don't think it
proper for his daddy

481
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:52,923
to give him
intoxicating libations.

482
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:54,875
Mom, I'd like to
tell you about the...

483
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:56,927
We were just talking
about your party, son.

484
00:25:56,928 --> 00:25:59,429
What party?
Your coming-home party

485
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,932
to celebrate your return
from the war.

486
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:04,434
We can have the Wilsons
and the pomfrets.

487
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:05,436
Oh, yes,
they're a must.

488
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:08,939
They get absolutely
hilarious at parties.

489
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,942
They get
absolutely stoned, is what they get.

490
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:12,943
Yes.

491
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:13,945
Uh, Chadwick,

492
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:15,946
I think it would be
much impressier

493
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:18,949
if you wore your uniform
with all the medals you won.

494
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,951
I didn't win
any medals, Mom.

495
00:26:20,952 --> 00:26:22,452
Of course
you won medals.

496
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:23,954
What were all those
on your soldier suit?

497
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,455
Just marksmanship
and good conduct.

498
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:26,957
Oh, you see, daddy?

499
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,458
Every soldier wins one

500
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,460
if he hits the target
instead of an officer.

501
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:31,962
Oh, you put me in mind

502
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:33,463
of my great-grandfather
on my side,

503
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:34,965
Captain Matthew Polk.

504
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:36,974
Oh, he was one
o <i>the</i> bravest men

505
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:38,976
in the war
between the states.

506
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,978
Oh, the daring deeds
that man performed,

507
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,479
his bravery under fire,

508
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,982
his courage
on the field of battle

509
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:47,484
made us all proud
to be Polks.

510
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:49,486
Oh, it's such a shame

511
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:51,989
Captain Polk
was a damn yankee.

512
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,492
Chad, which one
do you want?

513
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:58,495
Well, let me see.

514
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:00,498
You need it, boy.
Take your pick.

515
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,500
Whew.
I think I'll stick

516
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:05,002
to the straight
pineapple juice.

517
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:07,505
We must decide
on the orchestra for the party.

518
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,246
Oh, well,
if you'll excuse me,

519
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,387
I think I'll freshen up
a little before dinner.

520
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:12,009
Aloha.

521
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,510
Yeah.

522
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,191
Orchestra? Say, Mom,
how about my friends?

523
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:16,593
You mean those
native boys?

524
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,455
The swingingest group
in the islands.

525
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:20,017
Oh, they are not
musicians, Chadwick.

526
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:21,519
They're just
beach boys.

527
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,340
Mom, they've turned
professional.

528
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:24,881
They do a lot of work
around town.

529
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:26,024
How'd you know that?

530
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:27,525
Uh, why...

531
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:29,027
he corresponded
with them

532
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:31,028
while he was
in Europe.

533
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:33,030
Now, Chadwick,
we might as well

534
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:35,032
have an understanding
right off.

535
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,034
You've come home
to stay,

536
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:39,537
and your life's
going to be different.

537
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:41,398
You're going
to associate yourself

538
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:43,540
with the finer elements
on this island,

539
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:46,043
and you're going to have
a responsible position

540
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,045
with the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company,

541
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:51,048
and you're going to marry
a girl of your own class

542
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,051
and be a gentleman
like your daddy.

543
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:56,054
Mom, do we have to
discuss this now?

544
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:59,056
Yes. I don't want you
wasting your precious time

545
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:01,558
on those beach boys
or that native girl.

546
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,561
Sarah Lee,
the boy just came home.

547
00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:05,904
I think
he should know

548
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:07,906
exactly what
we expect of him.

549
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:09,407
I know what
you expect of me.

550
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:11,409
I thought maybe after
a hitch in the army,

551
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,411
I could come back and
do what you want me to,

552
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:14,913
but now I know I can't.

553
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:16,915
Well, how do you know?
You just got back.

554
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,917
I've been back
for 5 days, Mom.

555
00:28:18,918 --> 00:28:19,918
5 days?

556
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,920
Yes, and for 5 days,
I've been at the beach,

557
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:23,421
living in my shack
and dreading the time

558
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:25,423
I would have to come
back here and tell you

559
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:26,925
I'm not going to
go to work

560
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:28,927
for the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company.

561
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:29,928
Sarah Lee.

562
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:31,429
Yes, daddy?

563
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,431
Let's talk about it
tomorrow, son.

564
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:34,432
Home 5 days,

565
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:36,434
and he didn't even
come to his mother.

566
00:28:36,435 --> 00:28:38,436
Mom, it's time
I started

567
00:28:38,437 --> 00:28:39,938
doing something
for myself,

568
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:41,440
like making my
own decisions.

569
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:45,410
Chadwick!

570
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:46,444
Chadwick!

571
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:47,946
Your mother
hasn't finished,

572
00:28:47,947 --> 00:28:49,948
and you haven't
had your dinner.

573
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:51,449
All of a sudden,
I'm not hungry.

574
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,451
Good night.

575
00:28:56,956 --> 00:28:58,957
And he didn't even
give his mama

576
00:28:58,958 --> 00:28:59,959
any good-night sugar.

577
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:01,960
Sarah Lee,
there are times

578
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,463
when I could wring
your fool neck.

579
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:24,483
Good evening, sir.
I'll take care of your car.

580
00:29:24,984 --> 00:29:25,984
Thank you.

581
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,532
Grandma!

582
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:16,534
No! No, no.

583
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:19,037
No, no, no!

584
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:39,557
Well, it is a pleasant
surprise, Chad.

585
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:41,059
Thanks, Mr. Duval.

586
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,560
We were not
expecting you.

587
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:45,563
I just came by
to pay my respects to Maile's grandmother.

588
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:47,065
Maile!

589
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:50,568
We have a visitor.

590
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:52,070
He says he dropped by

591
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:54,573
to pay his respects
to your grandmother.

592
00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:56,075
Excuse me.

593
00:30:56,575 --> 00:30:58,076
I thought
you were going home.

594
00:30:58,577 --> 00:31:00,578
I did. I'm out
on good behavior.

595
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,080
Mmm.

596
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:04,083
Your father said he
was glad to see me.

597
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,585
Well, I'm glad
to see you, too.

598
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:10,088
Come wish grandmother
a happy birthday.

599
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:13,092
Grandmother,
you remember Chad.

600
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:16,094
I am delighted
to see you again, Chad.

601
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:17,596
Welcome back
from the army.

602
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:19,657
Aloha, Mrs. manaka,
and happy birthday.

603
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:22,100
I brought you
a gift from Austria.

604
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:23,601
Thank you,

605
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:26,104
but the light you kindle
in my granddaughter's eye

606
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:27,606
is gift enough.

607
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:30,608
It's a music box.

608
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:32,110
It plays a European
love song,

609
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:34,112
but they're the same
in any language.

That's lovely, Chad.

00:33:25,224 --> 00:33:27,226
And so are you,
grandmother.

631
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:47,745
Sure beats lunch
in town, doesn't it?

632
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:49,247
Mmm.

633
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:51,249
You don't get this view
in town, either.

634
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,253
No, and it was easier
to get a reservation here.

635
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,773
Your grandmother
packs a pretty picnic.

636
00:34:15,774 --> 00:34:18,276
The way
to a man's heart.

637
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:20,278
She's making sure
I reach yours,

638
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:22,280
especially after
last night.

639
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,282
She loved the music box.

640
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:26,784
I'm glad.
She's a wonderful lady.

641
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:29,287
The difference between
your family and mine.

642
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:30,788
We're not
our families, Chad.

643
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:32,790
We're what we make
of ourselves.

644
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:33,791
You know, you're right.

645
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:35,793
And if I'm going to make
anything of myself,

646
00:34:35,794 --> 00:34:37,295
it's about time
to get started

647
00:34:37,296 --> 00:34:38,796
and take hold of things.

648
00:34:38,797 --> 00:34:40,799
While you're in the mood
to take hold...

649
00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:46,804
Maile, I've got
to get a job.

650
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:48,306
And, I gather,

651
00:34:48,307 --> 00:34:50,308
<i>not</i> in your father's
pineapple plant.

652
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:51,309
No, ma'am.

653
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,310
No red carpet,

654
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:53,811
where everybody
knows who I am.

655
00:34:53,812 --> 00:34:55,313
"He's the boss' son.
Be nice to him."

656
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:56,814
that's not for me.

657
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:58,316
Hawaii has a big future.

658
00:34:58,817 --> 00:35:00,818
I want to become
a part of it.

659
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:02,820
I'm young and healthy.
I'm not <i>too</i> stupid.

660
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:03,821
Well, wonderful.

661
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:05,823
This place is growing
by leaps and bounds.

662
00:35:05,824 --> 00:35:07,144
There are
more tourists come here

663
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:08,826
than any other state
in the union.

664
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:09,827
Hey, that's it!

665
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:11,829
I'm glad you
thought of it.

666
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,831
What did I think of?

667
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:13,831
Tourist business...
Your business.

668
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,333
It's booming, isn't it?

669
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:16,834
It's getting bigger
all the time.

670
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:18,235
I know every inch
of these islands.

671
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:19,337
I'd make a good
tourist guide.

672
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:20,658
You'd make a great
tourist guide.

673
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:21,839
I'll put a word in
with my boss.

674
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,841
No, you don't.
I'll put in my own word.

675
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:25,843
This mission is
strictly solo, you hear?

676
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:27,845
You're coming in
loud and proud.

677
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:29,847
I got to get going.
I got to see your boss!

678
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:31,849
I've wasted
too much time already.

679
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,851
Chad!

680
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:36,354
Haven't you
forgotten something?

681
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:38,357
Oh. Oh, yeah.

682
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,869
Hey! Hey!

683
00:35:53,872 --> 00:35:55,373
What about me?

684
00:35:55,374 --> 00:35:57,376
Oh. Oh, yeah!

685
00:36:19,398 --> 00:36:21,399
These are not
only decorative,

686
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,401
but they keep
my neck warm.

687
00:36:23,402 --> 00:36:26,404
Now, then, let me see.
Where were we?

688
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:28,406
Uh, we were somewhere,
weren't we?

689
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:29,907
Oh, yes. I was
telling you about

690
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:31,409
my having 2 years
at the university

691
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,070
before I went
to the mainland

692
00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:34,912
and joined the army.

693
00:36:34,913 --> 00:36:36,414
The army? Oh.

694
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:37,415
Well, that's a lovely
organization.

695
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,916
Yes.

696
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:41,919
And you say you've
lived here for 50 years?

697
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,422
50... No, 15 years,
ever since my father

698
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:46,424
was transferred from
the Atlanta office.

699
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,926
That's where Chad was born,
Mr. Chapman.

700
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:50,428
Huh?

701
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:51,429
Atlanta.

702
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,432
Oh! Oh, he was.
Yes.

703
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,434
Where is
the crouching lion?

704
00:36:56,435 --> 00:36:57,935
That's a rock formation

705
00:36:57,936 --> 00:36:59,937
on a cliff just north
of kaaawa beach.

706
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:02,440
It used to be
a native fishing shrine.

707
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:04,942
Well. Say, that's good.
That's very good.

708
00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:08,446
Yes, that's excellent.
I'm testing you, you see.

709
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:09,947
Have to be on your toes

710
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:11,449
if you want to work
for a man like me,

711
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,450
eh, Miss Duval?

712
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,451
Yes, sir.

713
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:15,453
Yes, you do.

714
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:18,956
Now, then, I am a tourist
from Chillicothe, Ohio,

715
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:21,459
and I want to see some
night-blooming cereus blossoms.

716
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,960
Where would you
take me?

717
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:25,463
I would take you
to the Punahou School.

718
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:27,965
The Punahou... you would?
That is good.

719
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:30,468
Yes, well...
That's splendid.

720
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:32,970
This young man knows,
Miss Duval.

721
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:35,973
I think he might do.
He might.

722
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:37,975
Well, I'll think it over.

723
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,977
When will you
let me know, sir?

724
00:37:39,978 --> 00:37:41,979
Well, when <i>I</i> know,
of course.

725
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,981
Oh. Yes, sir.

726
00:37:43,982 --> 00:37:45,983
Thank you,
Mr. Chapman.

727
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:47,986
Thank you,
Mr. Chapman.

728
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:54,992
Beautiful.

729
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:56,494
Beautiful!

730
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:58,497
That's Mr. Chadwick.

731
00:37:58,997 --> 00:38:00,998
Quick, cover it up,
Ping Pong.

732
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't want him
to see it.

733
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:05,002
Oh, everything
looks so festive,

734
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:06,504
doesn't it, daddy?

735
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:07,505
Yes.

736
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:08,506
Where's Chadwick?

737
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:09,507
He's on the telephone.

738
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:10,508
Straighten your tie.

739
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:12,009
Oh, I do hope
he's dressed.

740
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,511
Is he dressed?

741
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:15,513
He was the last time
I looked.

742
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,515
Fetch me a mai-tai,
Ping Pong.

743
00:38:17,516 --> 00:38:19,016
Oh, we got enough
bar glasses? I'll check.

744
00:38:19,017 --> 00:38:23,021
Oh, do that.
Oh, parties, parties.

745
00:38:24,022 --> 00:38:25,523
Mr. Chapman didn't
promise anything

746
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:27,024
when I saw him today.

747
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:29,026
I know, but something
came up unexpectedly,

748
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:30,528
and he needs you.

749
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:33,531
It's a new client...
A schoolteacher.

750
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:34,532
A schoolteacher?

751
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:36,033
She wants to meet you.

752
00:38:36,034 --> 00:38:37,034
Now?

753
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:38,536
It won't take long.

754
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:40,538
Meet me at the
Hawaiian Village Hotel in half an hour.

755
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:42,039
Suppose she doesn't
like me?

756
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,541
I never had much luck
with schoolteachers.

757
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,042
She'll like you.

758
00:38:45,043 --> 00:38:46,544
Just don't be late.

759
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:48,045
I'll pick you up.

760
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:49,547
Pick <i>who</i> up?

761
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:52,050
10 minutes, OK?
Good-bye.

762
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:55,052
I have to run out
for about an hour, Mom.

763
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,133
Oh, but you can't.
Our guests will be arriving soon.

764
00:38:57,556 --> 00:38:59,557
We're having
cocktails at 7:00 and dinner at 8:30.

765
00:38:59,558 --> 00:39:01,559
Who was that
on the telephone?

766
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Maile Duval.

767
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,562
I consented to engage
your beach boys

768
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:07,064
to provide music
for your party, but I will not...

769
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:09,567
If you want me back in time, let's
not start anything now, please.

770
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,068
Chadwick?
Yes?

771
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:12,069
Fix your tie.

772
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,071
Ohh...

773
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:28,085
She's supposed to meet us
right out here.

774
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:30,087
Have you met her before?

775
00:39:30,088 --> 00:39:31,589
No, I haven't.

776
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,590
We shouldn't
have any difficulty

777
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:35,092
in finding
a schoolteacher.

778
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:38,095
I could spot one
a mile away.

779
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:39,097
Uh-oh.

780
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,600
Mm-hmm.

781
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:46,604
Good afternoon.

782
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:47,605
Good afternoon.

783
00:39:47,606 --> 00:39:49,106
I'm Miss Duval

784
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:50,608
from the Hawaii
tourist guide service,

785
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:52,109
and this is Mr. Gates.

786
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,111
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Ingersol.

787
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,613
And I'm
Abigail Prentace...

788
00:39:55,614 --> 00:39:57,615
How do you do?

789
00:39:57,616 --> 00:39:59,583
The schoolteacher.

790
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:01,118
Sure...

791
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,621
you can spot them
a mile away.

792
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:05,122
Won't you join me?

793
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:06,123
Why, certainly.

794
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:08,626
We beg your pardon,
ma'am.

795
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:10,628
I'm terribly sorry.

796
00:40:10,629 --> 00:40:12,630
That's all right,
Miss Duval.

797
00:40:12,631 --> 00:40:14,131
I didn't expect
a tourist guide

798
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:15,633
dressed
like Mr. Gates.

799
00:40:15,634 --> 00:40:17,134
He <i>is</i> the guide,
isn't he?

800
00:40:17,135 --> 00:40:18,636
Yes, ma'am. These aren't
my working clothes.

801
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:20,137
My mother's giving
a party tonight.

802
00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:23,140
Mr. Gates comes from one
of our finest families.

803
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:25,483
Well, that's certainly
in his favor.

804
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:26,985
I must be
extremely careful

805
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:28,987
because I'm chaperoning
4 teenage girls.

806
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:31,489
That's a responsibility
not to be taken lightly.

807
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,491
I get along very well
with teenagers.

808
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:34,993
I used to be one myself.

809
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:36,494
And not too long ago.

810
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:38,497
Frankly, Miss Duval,

811
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:40,498
I was expecting
an older man.

812
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:42,500
Miss Prentace,
as part of the service,

813
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:45,003
I promise to, uh, get a
little older every day.

814
00:40:45,004 --> 00:40:47,505
Of course, if you would
prefer another guide,

815
00:40:47,506 --> 00:40:50,508
I'm sure that the office
could arrange it for you.

816
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:53,011
We'd like to keep
our customers perfectly satisfied.

817
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:56,014
Mr. Gates, do you think
you can satisfy

818
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:58,016
a schoolteacher
and 4 teenage girls?

819
00:40:58,017 --> 00:40:59,517
Oh, I'll sure try,
ma'am.

820
00:40:59,518 --> 00:41:02,020
I-I-I'll do
all I can.

821
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:03,521
Well, what I mean is,

822
00:41:03,522 --> 00:41:05,523
this is our first trip
to the islands,

823
00:41:05,524 --> 00:41:07,525
and the girls
are naturally curious

824
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:09,027
about
the local activities,

825
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:10,528
such as surfboard riding.

826
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:13,031
Can you arrange
instructions for them?

827
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:14,032
I'll teach them myself.

828
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:15,533
You?

829
00:41:15,534 --> 00:41:17,035
I grew up
on a surfboard.

830
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:19,037
Outriggers, catamarans...
I can handle them all.

831
00:41:19,038 --> 00:41:20,538
How wonderful.

832
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:23,041
Chad used to be an expert
at all outdoor sports.

833
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:24,042
Used to be?

834
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:26,544
Well, before he went
in the army.

835
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:28,546
He's been gone for 2 years.

836
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:31,549
He just got back, and I'm
afraid he's a little rusty.

837
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,052
I'm afraid Miss Duval
doesn't realize

838
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:36,554
how well-oiled
I kept my machinery.

839
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:40,058
What time do we start
in the morning?

840
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:41,559
9:00 all right? Here?

841
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,061
We'll be waiting,

842
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:44,563
and thank you
for coming by.

843
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:46,564
It's a pleasure
meeting you.

844
00:41:46,565 --> 00:41:48,066
And you.

845
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,068
Thank you.

846
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:52,070
Maile?

847
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:01,079
They didn't build
teachers like that when I went to school.

848
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,083
Oh, she's all right,
if you happen to like older women.

849
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:09,088
If she's older women, the rest of
the group are in big trouble. Ha!

850
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,090
You can drop me off
at my house.

851
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:14,092
What do you mean
drop you off?

852
00:42:14,093 --> 00:42:15,593
We got to celebrate
my new job.

853
00:42:15,594 --> 00:42:16,595
Aren't you supposed to be
at your mother's party?

854
00:42:17,096 --> 00:42:19,598
Shh. I'm the guide now,
remember?

855
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:24,102
Oh, do be careful,
daddy.

856
00:42:24,103 --> 00:42:25,603
Those mai-tais can
be mighty powerful.

857
00:42:25,604 --> 00:42:26,604
Yeah!

858
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:28,106
Oh, thank you,
daddy.

859
00:42:28,107 --> 00:42:29,608
Hello, darlings.

860
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:31,609
Oh, hello, Mrs. Gates.
This is a lovely party.

861
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,610
Oh, thank you.

862
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:34,112
I want you to try
some of this dip.

863
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:35,613
It's an old
Carolina recipe.

864
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:37,615
My grandmother Polk
brought it all the way

865
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:39,117
from Charleston
to Savannah.

866
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:41,119
It's delicious.
Hello, dears.

867
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
Good evening.

868
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:44,623
Oh, isn't it delightful?
It's all so festive.

869
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:46,624
Oh, Ping Pong,
I want you to be sure

870
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,626
that Mr. karnibad's glass
doesn't get too empty,

871
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:50,128
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

872
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:51,129
<i>Oui, oui,</i>
missy.

873
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,130
Oh, that's French.

874
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:54,133
Ping Pong's learning
to speak it.

875
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,634
So nice of you
to come to my party.

876
00:42:56,635 --> 00:42:59,637
Oh, there you are,
admiral Anthony.

877
00:42:59,638 --> 00:43:02,140
I see you folks have met
admiral Anthony.

878
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:03,641
General Anthony,
Mrs. Gates.

879
00:43:03,642 --> 00:43:05,643
Oh, you may be
only a general now,

880
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:07,145
but it's only
a matter of time

881
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:09,147
before they make you
an admiral.

882
00:43:09,148 --> 00:43:10,149
Hi, Chad.
Hi, Maile.

883
00:43:10,649 --> 00:43:11,650
Hello, everybody.

884
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:14,652
Daddy?

885
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:16,654
Excuse me. Yeah?

886
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:18,156
Look.

887
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:19,657
Oh, good. Chad's here.

888
00:43:19,658 --> 00:43:21,659
Yeah, but look
who's with him.

889
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,161
It's that girl.

890
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:24,162
Yes.

891
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:25,663
She's very attractive.

892
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:28,666
Daddy, aren't you
forgetting yourself?

893
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:31,169
I'm trying, mother.
I'm trying.

894
00:43:35,174 --> 00:43:36,674
Well, hello, Maile.

895
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:38,176
Nice to see
you again.

896
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:39,677
Thank you.

897
00:43:39,678 --> 00:43:40,678
Maile,
this is my mother.

898
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,180
It's about time
you two met.

899
00:43:42,181 --> 00:43:43,681
Mom, Maile Duval.

900
00:43:43,682 --> 00:43:45,683
Very glad to meet you,
Mrs. Gates.

901
00:43:45,684 --> 00:43:48,186
Chad's talked
so much about you.

902
00:43:48,187 --> 00:43:49,187
He has?

903
00:43:49,188 --> 00:43:51,189
Oh, that's nice,
Chadwick.

904
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,691
Oh, he's talked
about you, too.

905
00:43:53,692 --> 00:43:56,194
Oh, yes. We've both
talked about you.

906
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:57,196
Ha ha.

907
00:43:57,696 --> 00:43:58,696
Ahem.

908
00:43:58,697 --> 00:44:00,198
Yes.

909
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:02,700
Hey, men,
looks like Maile's on the rack.

910
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:05,203
Are you going to stay
for Chadwick's party, Miss Duval?

911
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:06,704
I'd like to very much.

912
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:08,206
Well, let's get her off.

913
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:09,708
Yeah. Let's rock!

Something we may
have to get used to, Sarah Lee.

963
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:14,832
It's called
the sound of youth.

964
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,334
Oh.

965
00:46:28,847 --> 00:46:30,348
Good morning,
Miss Prentace.

966
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:31,849
Good morning,
Miss Duval.

967
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,351
Girls, Miss Duval.

968
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:34,352
Hello, Miss Duval.

969
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:35,853
Good morning,
girls.

970
00:46:35,854 --> 00:46:37,355
These are alohas
for you.

971
00:46:37,356 --> 00:46:38,856
How lovely.

972
00:46:38,857 --> 00:46:39,858
Thank you.

973
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:41,860
Thank you.

974
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:43,862
Thank you.

975
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:45,864
Oh, how wonderful.

976
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:47,866
This is very nice
of you.

977
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:49,868
Good morning,
Miss Prentace.

978
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:52,870
Well, I must say,
you look more like a guide this morning.

979
00:46:52,871 --> 00:46:54,873
But you still
don't look like a schoolteacher.

980
00:46:55,374 --> 00:46:56,874
Girls, may I present
our guide?

981
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:59,877
Shall we start
our tour with the pineapple fields?

982
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:01,379
I hate
pineapples.

983
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,880
Then let's
go there first

984
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:04,382
and get it
over with.

985
00:47:04,383 --> 00:47:06,384
Are you going with us?

986
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:08,386
No, thanks.
I have to get back to my office.

987
00:47:08,387 --> 00:47:10,388
Can we give you
a lift?

988
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:12,391
Oh, that's not necessary.
It's just a few steps.

989
00:47:14,393 --> 00:47:15,894
Thank you.

990
00:47:19,898 --> 00:47:22,400
I hope you don't mind
being this crowded.

991
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:23,902
I don't mind at all.

992
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:28,906
Would you mind
closing the door, please?

993
00:47:28,907 --> 00:47:31,409
Well, have fun.

994
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,911
Aloha.

995
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:52,931
As you know, girls,
this is the island of Oahu,

996
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:54,432
and Honolulu,
our capital city,

997
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:55,933
is the largest
of all the islands.

998
00:47:55,934 --> 00:47:57,435
Anybody know
the population?

999
00:47:57,436 --> 00:47:59,937
Population...
Population...

1000
00:47:59,938 --> 00:48:02,440
Last count,
500,409.

1001
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:04,942
Correct.
Give the young lady

1002
00:48:04,943 --> 00:48:06,944
a 5-pound box
of broken records.

1003
00:48:06,945 --> 00:48:08,446
Call me Beverly.

1004
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,947
Right, Bev.

1005
00:48:09,948 --> 00:48:10,948
I'm Patsy.

1006
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:13,451
My name's Selena,
but call me Sandy.

1007
00:48:13,452 --> 00:48:15,453
And what's
your name?

1008
00:48:15,454 --> 00:48:17,955
You may call me
Miss Corbett.

1009
00:48:17,956 --> 00:48:19,457
La di da da!

1010
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,959
You might be
interested to know that since 1778,

1011
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,462
we've been welcoming <i>malihinis</i>
from all over the world.

1012
00:48:24,463 --> 00:48:25,463
Welcoming what?

1013
00:48:25,464 --> 00:48:27,965
<i>Malihinis</i>.
That's us.

1014
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:29,467
I thought
we were <i>wahines</i>.

1015
00:48:29,468 --> 00:48:31,469
You're both.
<i>Malihini</i> means newcomers.

1016
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,970
<i>Wahine</i>
means female.

1017
00:48:32,971 --> 00:48:34,972
What do you know?
We're <i>wahine malihinis</i>.

1018
00:48:34,973 --> 00:48:36,474
Big deal.

1019
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:38,976
Patsy, must you?

1020
00:48:38,977 --> 00:48:40,478
I did it!
I'm bored!

1021
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:42,480
That's quite rude, Ellie!
Chad was talking.

1022
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:43,981
That's OK,
Miss Prentace.

1023
00:48:43,982 --> 00:48:45,483
Make it louder,
duchess.

All right,
everybody out.

1059
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:33,090
This is one of our
smaller pineapple fields.

1060
00:50:33,091 --> 00:50:34,592
What are those
women doing?

1061
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:36,093
They're picking
the ripe fruit.

1062
00:50:36,094 --> 00:50:37,694
The conveyor belt
hauls it to the trucks

1063
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:39,096
and then
to the factories.

1064
00:50:39,097 --> 00:50:41,599
How come they still
pick them by hand?

1065
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,101
Before you pick a pineapple, you
got to be sure it's ripe enough,

1066
00:50:44,102 --> 00:50:46,604
and nothing can beat
the human eye in deciding when it's ready.

1067
00:50:46,605 --> 00:50:48,105
Well, that's
interesting.

1068
00:50:48,106 --> 00:50:50,608
Nobody ever came up
with anything better than the human hand

1069
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:52,729
to reach into
these little leaves and break them off.

1070
00:50:53,111 --> 00:50:54,111
That doesn't
look so tough.

1071
00:50:54,112 --> 00:50:55,113
Oh, no?
Try it.

1072
00:50:55,614 --> 00:50:56,114
Be careful.

1073
00:50:56,615 --> 00:50:57,616
Ow! It bites!

1074
00:50:58,116 --> 00:51:00,117
See what I mean?
These things are tricky.

1075
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:02,119
They're full of sharp
little edges.

1076
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,621
Can you get us
a pineapple, Chad?

1077
00:51:03,622 --> 00:51:05,122
Oh, I think that
could be arranged.

1078
00:51:05,123 --> 00:51:06,123
Nice, cold slices
of pineapple

1079
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:07,625
at this little stand
right over here.

1080
00:51:07,626 --> 00:51:09,126
Pineapples?

1081
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:12,129
What did
you expect? Bananas?

1082
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,632
Ellie,
don't you want some?

1083
00:51:14,633 --> 00:51:16,634
Hello, Mr. Gates.

1084
00:51:16,635 --> 00:51:18,636
Hello. My friends
would like some pineapple.

1085
00:51:18,637 --> 00:51:19,637
Certainly.

1086
00:51:19,638 --> 00:51:21,138
I bet it's delicious.

1087
00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:22,640
I feel like
something cool.

1088
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:24,642
Have you ever
tried it with salt?

1089
00:51:24,643 --> 00:51:27,144
Salt?
It's real good.

1090
00:51:27,145 --> 00:51:28,646
I'll take this
to Ellie.

1091
00:51:30,148 --> 00:51:32,650
Uh, I thought
you might like some.

1092
00:51:33,151 --> 00:51:34,151
I don't.

1093
00:51:34,152 --> 00:51:36,154
It's good. Why don't
you try it?

1094
00:51:38,657 --> 00:51:40,158
Thank you.

1095
00:51:43,828 --> 00:51:45,162
That's pretty rude.

1096
00:51:45,163 --> 00:51:47,164
Are you always so bored,
or is it me?

1097
00:51:47,165 --> 00:51:49,167
Life is a bore,
I always say.

1098
00:51:49,668 --> 00:51:50,668
Oh, already?

1099
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:52,169
I've had
17 years of it.

1100
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:55,173
That's the fun part.
Wait till the next 17.

1101
00:51:55,507 --> 00:51:58,175
Look, don't you start
that child psychology bit.

1102
00:51:58,176 --> 00:51:59,677
I'm no child.

1103
00:51:59,678 --> 00:52:01,178
I'm no psychologist.

1104
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:04,682
I believe you're being paid
to show us a good time.

1105
00:52:04,683 --> 00:52:06,183
When does it start?

1106
00:52:06,184 --> 00:52:08,185
The others seem to be
enjoying themselves.

1107
00:52:08,186 --> 00:52:09,687
They're a bunch
of drips.

1108
00:52:09,688 --> 00:52:11,689
Then why did you
come over with them?

1109
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,190
It wasn't my idea.

1110
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:16,694
I've got 2 mothers
and 3 fathers.

1111
00:52:16,895 --> 00:52:19,646
Oh, you must come
from a very rich family.

1112
00:52:19,647 --> 00:52:22,199
You're a very funny man.

1113
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,201
Now, look, I'm sorry...

1114
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:24,202
Don't be sorry.

1115
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,703
Just come up
with some action.

1116
00:52:25,704 --> 00:52:26,705
Got a match?

1117
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:28,205
I don't use them.

1118
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:29,206
It figures.

1119
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:31,709
What's your idea
of action?

1120
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:35,212
What's yours?

1121
00:52:35,213 --> 00:52:37,715
You're
a very funny girl.

1122
00:52:37,716 --> 00:52:39,217
Just wait and see.

1123
00:53:34,272 --> 00:53:35,773
Yes, Mr. Chapman?

1124
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:38,275
Miss Duval, come
in here, please.

1125
00:53:38,276 --> 00:53:40,277
Yes, sir.

1126
00:53:40,278 --> 00:53:42,279
Yes, now, dear, but...

1127
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,782
Well, I certainly will,
dear. Of course.

1128
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:47,284
All right.
8:30 sharp, huh?

1129
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:49,286
All right, dear.
Good-bye.

1130
00:53:49,287 --> 00:53:50,788
Just talked to my wife.

1131
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:53,290
I promised to take her
to the concert tonight.

1132
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:55,793
Oh, I must remember
that, too. The concert.

1133
00:53:55,794 --> 00:53:58,796
Now, then, Miss Duval,
what is it you want?

1134
00:53:58,797 --> 00:54:00,799
Uh, Mr. Chapman,
you sent for me.

1135
00:54:01,299 --> 00:54:02,299
I did?

1136
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,301
Well, what is it
I want?

1137
00:54:04,302 --> 00:54:06,304
Has it anything
to do with Chad?

1138
00:54:06,805 --> 00:54:07,806
Chad who?

1139
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:10,307
Chad Gates,
remember?

1140
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:11,809
Oh! Oh, yes.

1141
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,811
Oh, say,
he's a fine-looking boy.

1142
00:54:13,812 --> 00:54:15,813
He's bright, too.
We should hire him.

1143
00:54:15,814 --> 00:54:17,815
He's been working
for you for 2 days.

1144
00:54:17,816 --> 00:54:20,818
He's the guide
for Miss Prentace and the girls.

1145
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:22,319
Uh, gir... girls?

1146
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,321
Wait a minute.
Look here.

1147
00:54:24,322 --> 00:54:26,824
I don't want
any of my guides carrying on with girls.

1148
00:54:26,825 --> 00:54:28,826
There's no hanky-panky
on this job.

1149
00:54:28,827 --> 00:54:30,327
Mr. Chapman,
it's all right.

1150
00:54:30,328 --> 00:54:32,329
He's just showing them
the local color.

1151
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,832
Tonight, he's taking
them to a <i>hukilau.</i>

1152
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:36,333
Hukilau, eh?

1153
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:38,336
Oh, well,
that sounds like fun.

1154
00:54:38,837 --> 00:54:39,837
Oh, my fish.

1155
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:42,339
Well, you should
enjoy that.

1156
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,841
I'm not going.

1157
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:46,844
He's taking
Miss Prentace and the girls.

1158
00:54:46,845 --> 00:54:48,345
Ah, Miss Prentace.

1159
00:54:48,346 --> 00:54:50,848
Oh, she's a lovely woman,
that Miss Prentace.

1160
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:52,349
They make
a handsome couple...

1161
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,851
Yes, young Gates
and Miss Prentace.

1162
00:54:54,352 --> 00:54:55,352
They do?

1163
00:54:55,353 --> 00:54:56,854
Yes.

1164
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:58,856
Miss Prentace is quite
taken with the boy, too.

1165
00:54:58,857 --> 00:55:00,357
She's even extended
her tour.

1166
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:04,361
Now, <i>that's</i> hanky-panky
from where I stand.

1167
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:07,364
What? Oh, excuse me.
Well, please sit down.

1168
00:55:07,365 --> 00:55:09,366
No, Mr. Chapman,
that's all right.

1169
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:10,868
I don't need a seat.

1170
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:12,369
Oh. Well, I do.

1171
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,371
I'll take 2
for the concert.

1172
00:55:14,372 --> 00:55:15,873
Oh, that concert.

1173
00:55:15,874 --> 00:55:17,875
That's what I wanted
to speak to you about.

1174
00:55:17,876 --> 00:55:21,378
I was wondering, would you care to
take my wife to the concert tonight?

1175
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:23,380
I'm afraid I can't.
I've decided

1176
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:25,382
I'd better go
to the <i>hukilau.</i>

1177
00:55:25,383 --> 00:55:26,884
The <i>hukilau?</i>

1178
00:55:26,885 --> 00:55:28,886
Well, if you
can't make it,

1179
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:31,388
I'll just have to go to
the concert by myself.

1180
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:32,890
Yes, Mr. Chapman.

1181
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:35,392
Huh. <i>Huk... hukilau.</i>

1182
00:55:35,393 --> 00:55:37,895
Oh, my fish. I... yeah.

1183
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:42,399
Yeah. Come on, boys.
Come on.

1184
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,401
You girls, too. There.

1185
00:55:44,402 --> 00:55:45,903
Oh, Chad!
May I help you?

1186
00:55:45,904 --> 00:55:47,905
Oh, that's all right.
I'll help him.

1187
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:49,407
No, we're OK.
We'll talk later.

1188
00:55:49,908 --> 00:55:50,408
Girls?

1189
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:53,911
Patsy? Beverly? Sandy?
Come on.

1190
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:56,413
Chad, why don't you go get
some firewood for dinner?

1191
00:55:56,414 --> 00:55:57,414
Firewood?

1192
00:55:57,415 --> 00:55:59,417
Man, you'll eat
anything.

1193
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:02,127
Hey,
watch it, man.

1194
00:56:02,628 --> 00:56:03,748
Isn't this
a beautiful spot?

1195
00:56:04,129 --> 00:56:05,630
Lovely. Look at
the palm trees.

1196
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,633
Come on, ito,
start the fire.

1197
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:15,641
Do you want
some help? What?

1198
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:20,144
What are you trying
to do, Ellie?

1199
00:56:20,145 --> 00:56:21,145
I did it.

1200
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:22,146
Well, congratulations.

1201
00:56:22,147 --> 00:56:24,148
Didn't you like it?

1202
00:56:24,149 --> 00:56:25,650
Wait a minute.
Are you trying to get us both in trouble?

1203
00:56:26,151 --> 00:56:27,151
Do you want
to kiss me again?

1204
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:29,654
I want you to go
back to the others and behave yourself.

1205
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:32,657
Why? Afraid you
might like it?

1206
00:56:32,658 --> 00:56:34,660
I don't rob cradles.

1207
00:56:37,162 --> 00:56:40,665
Did you ever see anything
like this in a cradle?

1208
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:46,672
Come here, Ellie.

1209
00:56:46,872 --> 00:56:49,674
Hold out your arms.

1210
00:56:49,675 --> 00:56:51,677
Now close
your little eyes.

1211
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,180
Take this to ito.

1212
00:56:57,156 --> 00:56:58,157

01:03:05,274 --> 01:03:06,474
The last few days,

1318
01:03:06,475 --> 01:03:08,977
I don't know what time
that boy's gotten in.

1319
01:03:08,978 --> 01:03:10,979
It must have been
after 1:00 last night.

1320
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:13,481
I woke up when I heard
our dog barking,

1321
01:03:13,482 --> 01:03:15,984
and I thought Chadwick
was coming in then.

1322
01:03:15,985 --> 01:03:17,986
But then I realized
it couldn't be,

1323
01:03:17,987 --> 01:03:19,988
because we
don't have a dog.

1324
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:21,990
Are you listening
to me, daddy?

1325
01:03:21,991 --> 01:03:23,992
Hmm? Oh, yes!

1326
01:03:23,993 --> 01:03:25,994
Oh, Ping Pong,
my eggs are cold.

1327
01:03:25,995 --> 01:03:28,997
Take them back
and warm them up, <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

1328
01:03:28,998 --> 01:03:30,999
<i>Oui, oui,</i> missy.
Morning, Mr. Chadwick.

1329
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,500
Hi, Ping.

1330
01:03:32,501 --> 01:03:34,502
You want some
cold eggs?

1331
01:03:34,503 --> 01:03:36,504
No, thanks.
I'll stick to juice and coffee.

1332
01:03:36,505 --> 01:03:38,897
Thank you.
Good morning, Mom, Pop.

1333
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,399
Morning, Chadwick.

1334
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,401
You got some sugar
for your mama this morning?

1335
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,403
You're up early
this morning, young man.

1336
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,405
Have to, Pop.
I got a job.

1337
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:47,906
A job? Working?

1338
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,408
Sure.
For the last 3 days,

1339
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:50,909
I've been
a full-fledged employee

1340
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,911
of the Hawaiian
tourist guide service.

1341
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,413
Oh, Chadwick,
how could you?

1342
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,415
I thought you wanted
me to work, Mom.

1343
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,917
Oh, not as
a common employee.

1344
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,419
Acting as
a messenger boy

1345
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,920
for a group
of tourists

1346
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,922
when you could follow in
your daddy's footsteps,

1347
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,424
wind up
as the vice president

1348
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:06,925
of the Great Southern
Hawaiian fruit?

1349
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,927
I fail to comprehend
you, Chadwick.

1350
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,429
I like my job, Mom.

1351
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,930
It's fun,
it's interesting,

1352
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,432
and I meet a lot
of nice people.

1353
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,436
Nonsense!
Tourists aren't people.

1354
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,437
They're...
They're tourists.

1355
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:21,440
Easy, Sarah Lee.
I'm very sensitive.

1356
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,441
Hi, Jack.
Morning, Jack.

1357
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:25,444
Good morning.
Tell me, Chad,

1358
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:26,945
where does
another tourist meet

1359
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,947
these nice people
you talk about?

1360
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,449
Why don't you
try the island inn?

1361
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,450
They're having
a luau tonight.

1362
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,952
Boy, I am late.
I've got a meeting

1363
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,954
with the grievance
committee this morning.

1364
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:36,956
Want to sit in, Jack?

1365
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:38,957
Not me.
I'm on vacation.

1366
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:39,958
Could you
drop me off, dad? Sure.

1367
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:40,959
Where's
your car, son?

1368
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,962
I don't need it.
I can drive the company car.

1369
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:44,963
Bye, Mom, Jack.

1370
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,465
Bye, mother.
See you tonight.

1371
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,468
Jack.
Fred.

1372
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,470
Land!

1373
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:55,974
My son driving
tourists around like a chauffeur!

1374
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,977
It's a disgrace.

1375
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,479
I don't know.

1376
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,981
When you married Fred,
he was just a chauffeur,

1377
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,984
driving bananas around
in my old truck.

1378
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:09,488
I'd rather drive girls
than bananas any day.

corny hula stuff

in dancing school

That was wonderful,

How about dancing

to dance with me.

Yeah, boy, go ahead
and dance with Enid.

You dance with her.
She's with you.

Oh, no. Not me.
I've been dancing with her for 15 years.

Excuse me, Mr. Garvey.

I think you should go home
and sleep it off, sir.

You watch who you're
calling names, boy.

1471
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,238
You're gonna wind up
sleeping it off.

1472

Now, go on. Get lost.

Sir, why can't we
settle this...

Didn't I say move?

01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:54,953
Now, dad, I know how
you feel about it.

1532
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,454
I've posted your bail.
Let's go.

1533
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,956
What about
the other boys?

1534
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,457
They'll be out
in an hour.

1535
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,459
I'm sure they
all have sympathetic fathers like yours.

1536
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,961
I'm very upset
about this, Chad.

1537
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,963
I know you are,
but I couldn't help it.

1538
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,965
I thought this tourist
guide idea of yours

1539
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,967
would teach you
some responsibility.

1540
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,488
There he is!
I'll fix you, you'll see!

1541
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,470
If you'd just
be fair about this.

1542
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,972
I'm sorry about
your black eye.

1543
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,473
There he is!

1544
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:16,975
I've got him.
I've got him.

1545
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,476
Lieutenant,
arrest this man.

1546
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,978
But he's just
been released.

1547
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,479
Released?
That's not right.

1548
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,481
Not at all.
He's a violent boy!

1549
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,484
Just a minute. I happen
to be this boy's father.

1550
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,485
Runs in the family,
so watch it.

1551
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,987
They may strike
at any minute.

1552
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,488
Oh, Mrs. Garvey!

1553
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,490
Mrs. Garvey knows
how wild he is.

1554
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,992
She told me
all about it.

1555
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,994
Didn't you, Mrs...
Oh, my goodness!

1556
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:38,497
You should
never wear green with that eye.

1557
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:39,998
Ow!

1558
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,500
Who is this
character, anyway?

1559
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,002
This is my boss, dad.

1560
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,004
Your ex-boss.
You're fired, young man!

1561
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,506
Mr. Chapman,
he was only protecting your clients.

1562
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,008
You can't fire him.

1563
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,010
Yes, I can.
I'll do it again.

1564
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,512
Just watch me.
You're fired! You see?

1565
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:57,015
Why don't you give me
a chance to explain what happened?

1566
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,017
I don't want any
explana... I want the money. $700.

1567
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,518
What for?

1568
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,520
To cover for the damages
your son caused.

1569
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,022
What a mess it was.

1570
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:05,523
I haven't got $700.

1571
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:08,026
You haven't got...
Then your father will have to pay it!

1572
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,527
I will not!

1573
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,529
It's OK. The newspapers
will be on my side.

1574
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,031
What do you mean?
What newspapers?

1575
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,532
The newspapers
I give the story to...

1576
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,534
About how a guide from
your tourist service got into a fight

1577
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,036
and everybody
wound up in jail,

1578
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,537
including one
of the tourists.

1579
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,538
That's good,
isn't it?

1580
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,040
Yeah, that's good.
No, it's bad!

1581
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,541
That's very bad
for business.

1582
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,543
I'll sue the newspapers.
That's what I'll do.

1583
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,045
That's good, isn't it?

1584
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:28,546
Yes.
That's good.

1585
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,049
I'll waive the release
and go back to my cell.

1586
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,550
No, you won't.
He can't do that!

1587
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,552
He's going to ruin
my business.

1588
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,055
I demand, Lieutenant,
that you rel... release...

1589
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,556
whatever.
Send him home.

1590
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,508
Just send him home,
that's all.

1591
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,561
He's free to go.

1592
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:44,062
Come on, Chad.
Let's go.

1593
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:47,065
Miss Duval,
I'll see you back at the office.

1594
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,567
No, you won't,
Mr. Chapman. I just quit.

1595
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,569
Ah, you think she...
Quit?!

1596
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,071
You can't do that!

1597
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,073
Yes, I can,
and I'll do it again.

1598
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,576
Watch.
I quit! See?

1599
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:09,088
My baby!

1600
01:15:10,289 --> 01:15:13,091
Oh, my baby!

1601
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,593
Oh, my baby's home
from the big house!

1602
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,596
Oh, Sarah Lee,
will you forget those old movies?

1603
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,099
Oh, you are all right,
aren't you, Chadwick?

1604
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,101
They didn't grill you
under a lamp or anything?

1605
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,103
No, Mom.
No grilling, no lamp.

1606
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,604
I'm just fine.

1607
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,107
I do hope this doesn't
get back home.

1608
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,609
Daddy, there hasn't
been a Gates in jail

1609
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,612
since the revenuers caught your
moonshining uncle squeezing corn.

1610
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:37,115
He was your uncle,
Sarah Lee. He was a Polk.

1611
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:40,118
Mom, I'm sorry,
honestly, but it wasn't my fault.

1612
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,121
Oh, I know that, dear.
It's your friends.

1613
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:46,624
Mostly that Duval girl.
She's the one to blame.

1614
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,126
Maile had nothing
to do with it.

1615
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,628
Well, she was there,
wasn't she?

1616
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,130
You got that job working
in her tourist place.

1617
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:54,133
Well, who else
can we blame?

1618
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,134
She's pulling you down
to her level.

1619
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,635
I won't listen
to that kind of talk.

1620
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,137
Then listen to this.

1621
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:01,139
You've tried it your way,
and you've made a mess of it.

1622
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,640
Now you'll
try it <i>our</i> way,

1623
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,142
and our way means
no more beach friends

1624
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,643
and no more
harebrained jobs.

1625
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,145
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1626
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,147
Yes. I can't promise
I'll go along with it.

1627
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,150
If you remain in this house,
you'll go along with it.

1628
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:14,653
I'm sorry. You just made
the decision for me.

1629
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:19,157
Chadwick!
Think of who you are.

1630
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:22,160
Remember, you come
from a fine family.

1631
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:25,663
You'll do enough remembering
for both of us, Mom.

1632
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,665
Oh, daddy!

1633
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:31,169
What did we
do wrong?

1634
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,173
Offhand, I'd say
we got married.

1635
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,694
This is the life,
isn't it?

1636
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,196
How do you like
being unemployed? I don't.

1637
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,698
How would you like
to be married? Are you asking?

1638
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:02,700
Not till I know
what the answer's going to be.

1639
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,203
One more setback,
and I'll establish a new record...

1640
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,205
First man ever to lose
a home, a family,

1641
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,207
a job, and a girl
all in one day.

1642
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,709
You were perfectly right
in what you did. Yeah?

1643
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,213
Chad, don't quit.
Bounce right back.

1644
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,215
There's so much
you can do.

1645
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:19,217
Yeah. I can be
a tourist guide.

1646
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,219
Miss Prentace thought
you were a good guide.

1647
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,222
I saw her at the office
when I picked up my things.

1648
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,724
She really blasted
Mr. Chapman for firing you.

1649
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,726
She canceled
the rest of her tour.

1650
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,229
She seems to think
a lot of you.

1651
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,231
I'm sorry
about the tour.

1652
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,733
I really think she was
enjoying herself.

1653
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,735
I know she was.

1654
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,737
She's not taking
the girls home, is she?

1655
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,240
Unless she signs on
with another guide service.

1656
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,743
But I'm more concerned
about your plans than hers.

1657
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,745
- Maile, you're a wonderful girl!
- I am?

1658
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:48,746
You're pretty, too.

1659
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,248
Not only wonderful
and pretty, you got a brain.

1660
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:53,251
I'm so glad
I was able to help.

1661
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:54,752
Bye. Take care
of my board, OK?

1662
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:55,753
- Where are you going?
- See Miss Prentace.

1663
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:57,756
Miss Prentace?

1664
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,260
We just made a deal
to continue the tour.

1665
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,261
Now, if you'll
follow through...

1666
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,263
Plane reservations

1667
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:08,766
and hotel accommodations
at Kauai.

1668
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,768
I'll do what I can.

1669
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:13,271
By the way,
congratulations.

1670
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,274
Was she hard to convince?

1671
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:19,615
Uh... Nah. She was
all for the idea.

1672
01:18:21,617 --> 01:18:24,619
That's right.
3 days.

1673
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,121
When I come back,
we'll celebrate.

1674
01:18:27,122 --> 01:18:29,624
Good-bye, honey.

1675
01:19:12,668 --> 01:19:14,169
OK, girls,
let's go inside.

1676
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:15,671
Hello.

1677
01:19:17,172 --> 01:19:18,673
OK, girls.
Follow your luggage.

1678
01:19:18,674 --> 01:19:19,675
Isn't this beautiful?

1679
01:19:20,175 --> 01:19:21,676
Look at
the palm trees!

1680
01:19:21,677 --> 01:19:23,177
And the bridge
over the lagoon.

1681
01:19:23,178 --> 01:19:24,679
Yes, it's nice.

1682
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,681
Oh, I'm going
to like it here.

1683
01:19:26,682 --> 01:19:29,684
We'll meet in the
lobby in half an hour, girls.

1684
01:19:29,685 --> 01:19:32,186
Beverly, you come with me.
We're rooming together.

1685
01:19:32,187 --> 01:19:34,189
Put on your riding clothes, girls.

1686
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:36,191
I'll arrange
for the horses.

That's for dinner,
girls.

1713
01:21:23,298 --> 01:21:25,800
Ooh. I'm starved.
I could eat a horse.

1714
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:27,301
Please,
make it mine.

1715
01:21:27,302 --> 01:21:29,303
Shall we go in
to dinner now?

1716
01:21:29,304 --> 01:21:31,305
We'll have to wait
to be called.

1717
01:21:31,306 --> 01:21:33,307
Oh. Well, uh, who's
going to call us?

1718
01:21:41,266 --> 01:21:43,317
That's the traditional
Hawaiian way

1719
01:21:43,318 --> 01:21:44,819
of announcing
that chow's on.

1720
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:45,821
Oh!

1721
01:22:47,382 --> 01:22:48,383
Pretty impressive, huh?

1722
01:22:48,884 --> 01:22:49,884
Beautiful.
Indeed.

1723
01:22:51,386 --> 01:22:52,387
Shall we, ladies?

1724
01:22:52,888 --> 01:22:53,888
Mmm, yes.

1725
01:22:53,889 --> 01:22:54,890
Duchess?

1726
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:56,891
Dinner is served.

1727
01:23:08,904 --> 01:23:10,405
Oh, this one
and that one.

1728
01:23:10,906 --> 01:23:11,906
Did you tell Chad
you were coming?

1729
01:23:11,907 --> 01:23:14,408
No. I want
to surprise him.

1730
01:23:14,409 --> 01:23:15,910
Are you sure
Miss Prentace

1731
01:23:15,911 --> 01:23:17,411
is staying
at the same hotel?

1732
01:23:17,412 --> 01:23:18,913
I made the
reservations myself.

1733
01:23:18,914 --> 01:23:20,915
You're almost as anxious
to get to the hotel as I am.

1734
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:22,416
I have business there.

1735
01:23:22,417 --> 01:23:23,918
So have i.

1736
01:23:23,919 --> 01:23:25,420
Here you are.

1737
01:24:16,922 --> 01:24:19,924
Hi, Chad!
What do you want?

1738
01:24:19,925 --> 01:24:22,426
Shh!
Uh-uh. Off limits. Back to your room.

1739
01:24:22,427 --> 01:24:25,930
I couldn't sleep there.

1740
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:27,932
Well, you sure can't
sleep here. You...

1741
01:24:27,933 --> 01:24:29,934
Whew! That perfume!

1742
01:24:29,935 --> 01:24:31,936
You ought
to take a bath.

1743
01:24:31,937 --> 01:24:34,438
On second thought,
you ought to take a cold shower.

1744
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:35,940
Chad, I'm lonesome.

1745
01:24:35,941 --> 01:24:37,441
I want someone
to talk to.

1746
01:24:37,442 --> 01:24:38,482
What about
your roommates?

1747
01:24:38,944 --> 01:24:39,944
They're sleeping.

1748
01:24:39,945 --> 01:24:42,446
Well, that's where
you should be... in bed!

1749
01:24:42,447 --> 01:24:44,949
I am in bed.

1750
01:24:46,451 --> 01:24:47,952
Uh-oh.

1751
01:24:47,953 --> 01:24:49,921
Hello?

1752
01:24:49,922 --> 01:24:52,456
This is Maile.
I just got in.

1753
01:24:52,457 --> 01:24:54,959
Oh, Maile.
You just got in where?

1754
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,460
Here at the hotel.

1755
01:24:56,461 --> 01:24:59,463
I thought it would be
a surprise.

1756
01:24:59,464 --> 01:25:00,965
S-s-surprise?

1757
01:25:00,966 --> 01:25:02,466
It... it is.

1758
01:25:02,467 --> 01:25:04,468
I mean, I'm glad
you're here.

1759
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:06,470
Are you receiving
visitors?

1760
01:25:06,471 --> 01:25:09,473
Well, I was just
getting ready for bed.

1761
01:25:09,474 --> 01:25:12,477
It's been a rough day,
and I'm tired.

1762
01:25:12,561 --> 01:25:13,978
Am I getting the brush?

1763
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:17,481
No, no.

1764
01:25:17,482 --> 01:25:18,983
No!

1765
01:25:18,984 --> 01:25:19,984
No.

1766
01:25:19,985 --> 01:25:22,487
I'll meet you in the bar
in 5 minutes.

1767
01:25:22,704 --> 01:25:24,489
Well, then.
That's better.

1768
01:25:25,991 --> 01:25:27,992
Well, at least
we have 5 minutes.

1769
01:25:27,993 --> 01:25:30,494
<i>I</i> have 5 minutes.
Your time is up,

1770
01:25:30,495 --> 01:25:31,996
miss oversexed
and underage.

1771
01:25:31,997 --> 01:25:33,497
I spent
one night in jail on account of you.

1772
01:25:33,498 --> 01:25:35,499
That's when I knew.
Knew what?

1773
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:39,503
When you fought with Mr. Garvey
at that party, I knew you cared.

1774
01:25:39,504 --> 01:25:41,005
I wasn't fighting
over you.

1775
01:25:41,006 --> 01:25:44,008
No? Don't you think
I'm worth fighting for?

1776
01:25:44,009 --> 01:25:45,509
I think you're
a mixed-up kid

1777
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:47,011
that's too big
for her britches.

1778
01:25:47,012 --> 01:25:49,513
I don't wear britches.

1779
01:25:49,514 --> 01:25:51,515
You're getting out
of here right now,

1780
01:25:51,516 --> 01:25:52,516
miss no-britches
Bardot!

1781
01:25:52,517 --> 01:25:54,518
Chad, do you think
I'm pretty?

1782
01:25:54,519 --> 01:25:56,520
I think
you're pretty forward and pretty stupid.

1783
01:25:56,521 --> 01:25:59,023
Wouldn't you rather
hold me than old Abigail?

1784
01:25:59,024 --> 01:26:01,526
I'd like to hold you
over a barbecue pit.

1785
01:26:03,028 --> 01:26:04,528
Who is it?

1786
01:26:04,529 --> 01:26:06,530
Us! Patsy!
And Sandy!

1787
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:08,532
What is this,
game night at Coco Palms?

1788
01:26:08,533 --> 01:26:10,534
We've got
to see you. It's important.

1789
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,540
What are you
doing here? We're looking for Ellie.

1790
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:18,543
Has she been here?
This is my room. Out!

1791
01:26:19,044 --> 01:26:21,045
And that's my perfume!
And she's wearing my peignoir!

1792
01:26:21,046 --> 01:26:22,547
You're ruining
my sleep!

1793
01:26:23,048 --> 01:26:24,549
That dirty
little sneak!

1794
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:26,050
Who's a dirty sneak?

1795
01:26:26,051 --> 01:26:27,051
You are!
You stole my perfume!

1796
01:26:27,052 --> 01:26:28,132
You're wearing
my peignoir!

1797
01:26:28,553 --> 01:26:31,055
Shh! Keep quiet, girls!
Ellie was just leaving.

1798
01:26:31,056 --> 01:26:33,057
I don't care what
she's doing, but not in my peignoir.

1799
01:26:33,058 --> 01:26:34,558
Don't you dare!

1800
01:26:34,559 --> 01:26:36,060
You've got
a lot of nerve!

1801
01:26:36,061 --> 01:26:37,061
Go back to your room.
Shh! Shh!

1802
01:26:37,062 --> 01:26:39,063
Go back to your rooms
and settle this.

1803
01:26:39,064 --> 01:26:41,065
I'll depend on you
to explain to them

1804
01:26:41,066 --> 01:26:43,067
what you were doing here
and why you were here.

1805
01:26:43,068 --> 01:26:44,568
Everybody get out,
please.

1806
01:26:46,071 --> 01:26:47,071
Uh, yes?

1807
01:26:47,072 --> 01:26:49,073
Abigail Prentace,
Chad. May I see you?

1808
01:26:49,074 --> 01:26:50,574
Just a second.

1809
01:26:50,575 --> 01:26:53,077
Girls, in the bed...
No, no!

1810
01:26:53,578 --> 01:26:55,580
Come on. Out here.

1811
01:27:00,585 --> 01:27:01,585
Hello.

1812
01:27:01,586 --> 01:27:03,087
I hope I didn't
disturb you.

1813
01:27:03,088 --> 01:27:05,589
I've never been more
disturbed in my life.

1814
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:10,094
Oh? Well, this is
irregular, I know, but may I come in?

1815
01:27:10,095 --> 01:27:13,097
Sure. Come on in.
We're having open house tonight.

1816
01:27:13,098 --> 01:27:15,099
I was so restless,

1817
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,601
I went out walking
in the moonlight.

1818
01:27:17,602 --> 01:27:20,104
Moonlight in Hawaii can
be rather intoxicating.

1819
01:27:20,105 --> 01:27:23,107
Yeah, I know.
That's why I never touch the stuff.

1820
01:27:23,108 --> 01:27:25,109
I just had to talk
to someone.

1821
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:27,611
Whatever it is,
this is the night for it.

1822
01:27:27,612 --> 01:27:29,613
Chad? I'm not as young
as you might think I am.

1823
01:27:29,614 --> 01:27:31,115
Oh?

1824
01:27:31,116 --> 01:27:32,116
Not old!

1825
01:27:32,117 --> 01:27:34,118
But a little older
than you...

1826
01:27:34,119 --> 01:27:36,120
not that that should
make a difference.

1827
01:27:36,121 --> 01:27:38,122
No. It doesn't make
any difference.

1828
01:27:38,123 --> 01:27:41,625
You know, I've taken
a vacation every summer,

1829
01:27:41,626 --> 01:27:43,627
looking for...

1830
01:27:43,628 --> 01:27:45,129
well... romance.

1831
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:46,630
An attractive girl
like you

1832
01:27:46,631 --> 01:27:48,632
shouldn't have any
trouble finding romance.

1833
01:27:48,633 --> 01:27:49,634
Thank you.

1834
01:27:50,018 --> 01:27:52,603
I'll get quickly
to my point.

1835
01:27:52,604 --> 01:27:54,605
When Miss Thackery
first asked me

1836
01:27:54,606 --> 01:27:56,607
to chaperone the girls
on this trip,

1837
01:27:56,608 --> 01:27:58,109
I accepted eagerly.

1838
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:00,111
I thought it would
insulate me

1839
01:28:00,112 --> 01:28:01,612
against
this frustration.

1840
01:28:01,613 --> 01:28:02,613
Yeah.

1841
01:28:02,614 --> 01:28:04,615
But instead, Chad,
it's happened.

1842
01:28:04,616 --> 01:28:05,617
What's happened?

1843
01:28:06,034 --> 01:28:08,619
I've found romance.

1844
01:28:09,037 --> 01:28:10,571
You have?

1845
01:28:13,575 --> 01:28:15,576
Ellie!

1846
01:28:15,577 --> 01:28:17,545
Ellie!

1847
01:28:19,548 --> 01:28:22,551
Ellie! Ellie!

1848
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,562
Chad...

1849
01:28:35,063 --> 01:28:37,065
I just can't
keep it a secret.

1850
01:28:41,069 --> 01:28:42,570
This is most unexpected.

1851
01:28:42,571 --> 01:28:44,071
To me, too, Chad.

1852
01:28:45,574 --> 01:28:46,574
Excuse me.

1853
01:28:46,575 --> 01:28:48,075
Open up! Chad! Chad!

1854
01:28:48,076 --> 01:28:50,578
Chad, Ellie's gone!
She stole the Jeep! What?

1855
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:52,079
She drove off
like a maniac!

1856
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,081
Calm down!
Which way did she go?

1857
01:28:54,082 --> 01:28:55,082
The front gate.

1858
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:56,584
Up the highway!

1859
01:28:56,585 --> 01:28:59,587
That crazy kid.
I'll get a car and see if I can catch her.

1860
01:28:59,588 --> 01:29:02,090
She went so fast,
we couldn't stop her.

1861
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:05,192
Ellie!

1862
01:30:05,593 --> 01:30:06,694
Ellie!

1863
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:13,200
Ellie!

1864
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:15,202
Ellie!

1865
01:30:15,203 --> 01:30:17,704
Oh! Oh!
Leave me alone! Let me go!

1866
01:30:17,705 --> 01:30:19,206
Stop it, Ellie!

1867
01:30:19,207 --> 01:30:21,208
I hate you!
Oh! Let me go!

1868
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:23,210
I'm trying
to help you!

1869
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:24,711
Oh! Let go!

1870
01:30:24,712 --> 01:30:26,213
Let go of me!

1871
01:30:26,714 --> 01:30:27,715
Stop it!

1872
01:30:30,718 --> 01:30:32,219
Listen to me.

1873
01:30:34,222 --> 01:30:36,223
Stop this!
Stop it!

1874
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:38,725
Why did you
have to stop me?

1875
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:40,727
Nobody cares about me...

1876
01:30:40,728 --> 01:30:42,730
whether I live or die.

1877
01:30:43,231 --> 01:30:46,234
Nobody seems to care because you
don't seem to care about yourself.

1878
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:47,734
You have to care first.

1879
01:30:47,735 --> 01:30:50,237
If you like yourself,
others will, too.

1880
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:51,738
There's nothing
to like.

1881
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:54,741
There's a lot to like if you wouldn't
try to be something you're not.

1882
01:30:54,742 --> 01:30:56,243
It don't work. I know.

1883
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:58,745
You better find out now

1884
01:30:58,746 --> 01:31:00,747
and save yourself
a lot of grief.

1885
01:31:00,748 --> 01:31:02,249
Everybody hates me.

1886
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:03,750
Nobody hates you.

1887
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:05,752
No? Then why
do my parents

1888
01:31:05,753 --> 01:31:07,754
always send me away...

1889
01:31:07,755 --> 01:31:11,258
to school all year,
on trips every summer?

1890
01:31:11,259 --> 01:31:13,260
And you...

1891
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,762
you threw me
out of your room.

1892
01:31:15,763 --> 01:31:17,764
You didn't throw
Abigail out.

1893
01:31:17,765 --> 01:31:19,766
You know
what you need?

1894
01:31:19,767 --> 01:31:22,406
A good old-fashioned
spanking.

1895
01:31:22,907 --> 01:31:24,408
M-maybe I do.

1896
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:27,911
Nobody ever cared enough
about me...

1897
01:31:27,912 --> 01:31:29,413
even for that.

1898
01:31:29,914 --> 01:31:30,914
All right, Eleanor.

1899
01:31:30,915 --> 01:31:33,417
If that will prove that
somebody does care...

1900
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:34,918
you wouldn't dare!

1901
01:31:34,919 --> 01:31:36,420
Wouldn't I dare?
Wouldn't I?

1902
01:31:36,421 --> 01:31:37,421
Oww! Oww!

1903
01:31:37,422 --> 01:31:39,423
I've got a feeling
this is going to

1904
01:31:39,424 --> 01:31:41,425
make both of us feel
an awful lot better.

1905
01:31:41,426 --> 01:31:42,926
Aah! Aah!

1906
01:31:42,927 --> 01:31:44,428
Mmm, these hot cakes
are good.

1907
01:31:44,429 --> 01:31:45,929
They're delicious.

1908
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:47,931
Ellie, pass the
guava jelly, please.

1909
01:31:47,932 --> 01:31:48,932
Here, Bev.

1910
01:31:49,934 --> 01:31:51,435
Gesundheit.

1911
01:31:51,436 --> 01:31:53,937
That's a good way to see
how many friends you got...

1912
01:31:53,938 --> 01:31:55,939
Sneeze, and then count
the gesundheits.

1913
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:58,942
Ellie, I hope you
didn't catch a head cold last night.

1914
01:31:58,943 --> 01:32:02,946
No, ma'am.
Just the opposite.

1915
01:32:02,947 --> 01:32:05,449
Maile, you haven't
touched your breakfast. Aren't you hungry?

1916
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:07,951
I don't have much of
an appetite this morning.

1917
01:32:07,952 --> 01:32:09,953
Oh? Are you feeling
all right?

1918
01:32:09,954 --> 01:32:12,456
As a matter of fact,
I'm not, Miss Prentace.

1919
01:32:12,457 --> 01:32:14,958
I didn't sleep
very well last night.

1920
01:32:14,959 --> 01:32:16,960
I had rather
a restless night myself.

1921
01:32:16,961 --> 01:32:18,962
Perhaps you should
get some rest

1922
01:32:18,963 --> 01:32:20,965
instead of going
riding with us today.

1923
01:32:22,467 --> 01:32:23,467
Maile!

1924
01:32:23,468 --> 01:32:26,470
We'll meet out front
in 20 minutes, girls,

1925
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:27,971
and don't be late.

1926
01:32:27,972 --> 01:32:29,973
Oh, we won't,
Miss Prentace.

1927
01:32:29,974 --> 01:32:31,475
We'll be there.
We promise.

1928
01:32:31,476 --> 01:32:34,478
Chad, I'd like
to talk to you.

1929
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:35,480
About last night?

1930
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:38,982
Yes. I didn't get a chance to
finish what I was telling you.

1931
01:32:38,983 --> 01:32:41,485
Miss Prentace,
I'm not the guy you think I am.

1932
01:32:41,486 --> 01:32:42,986
I snore
and everything.

1933
01:32:42,987 --> 01:32:44,988
Aloha!

1934
01:32:44,989 --> 01:32:45,989
Jack!

1935
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:47,491
Jack!

1936
01:32:48,493 --> 01:32:50,994
Abbie! I've been looking
all over for you.

1937
01:32:50,995 --> 01:32:53,997
Hi, Chad. I didn't want
to disturb you last night.

1938
01:32:53,998 --> 01:32:56,500
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

1939
01:32:56,501 --> 01:32:58,001
You mean
you and Jack?

1940
01:32:58,002 --> 01:32:59,002
Yes!

1941
01:32:59,003 --> 01:33:01,004
Congratulations...
To both of you!

1942
01:33:01,005 --> 01:33:02,005
Well, thanks.

1943
01:33:02,006 --> 01:33:03,507
It's great.
It's just great.

1944
01:33:03,508 --> 01:33:05,008
Look, fella,
I've got my girl.

1945
01:33:05,009 --> 01:33:06,510
What I just saw of yours,

1946
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:07,512
I'd say you got a few things
to straighten out.

1947
01:33:08,012 --> 01:33:09,012
Where did she go?

1948
01:33:09,013 --> 01:33:12,516
Last time I saw her,
she was headed for her bungalow.

1949
01:33:12,517 --> 01:33:14,017
Oh, I missed you.

1950
01:33:14,018 --> 01:33:16,019
Just great.
You don't know how great it is.

1951
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:17,521
Oh, he's a nice boy.

1952
01:33:17,522 --> 01:33:19,523
I hope things
work out for him.

1953
01:33:19,524 --> 01:33:22,025
He'll have to take care
of his girl himself.

1954
01:33:22,026 --> 01:33:24,066
Maybe I can give him a hand
with his other problem.

1955
01:33:24,529 --> 01:33:25,529
Come on.

1956
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,030
Operator.

1957
01:33:27,031 --> 01:33:28,532
You look wonderful.

1958
01:33:28,533 --> 01:33:31,535
Operator, get me
Mr. Fred Gates on Oahu.

1959
01:33:31,536 --> 01:33:34,038
The Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company.

1960
01:33:42,046 --> 01:33:43,047
Hi, honey!

1961
01:33:49,053 --> 01:33:51,555
You're in the wrong room,
lover boy.

1962
01:33:51,556 --> 01:33:53,557
Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

1963
01:33:53,558 --> 01:33:55,058
I got tied up
with...

1964
01:33:55,059 --> 01:33:57,060
With Miss Prentace!
I saw you.

1965
01:33:57,061 --> 01:33:59,563
I could try to explain
what happened, Maile,

1966
01:33:59,564 --> 01:34:01,565
but nobody would
believe me, not even me.

1967
01:34:01,566 --> 01:34:03,567
Would you just believe
this? I love you.

1968
01:34:03,568 --> 01:34:04,568
There's nothing between
Miss Prentace and me.

1969
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:06,570
Of course
you deny it,

1970
01:34:06,571 --> 01:34:08,572
but I know that look,
and she's got it.

1971
01:34:08,573 --> 01:34:11,575
That look is for Jack.
He's got it, too.

1972
01:34:11,576 --> 01:34:14,578
Mr. Kelman
and Miss Prentace?

1973
01:34:14,579 --> 01:34:16,580
Oh, you can do
better than that.

1974
01:34:16,581 --> 01:34:18,582
You must think
I'm a fool!

1975
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:19,583
Look, Maile...

1976
01:34:19,584 --> 01:34:22,085
Don't touch me!
Get out!

1977
01:34:22,086 --> 01:34:23,587
Men...
You can have them!

1978
01:34:23,588 --> 01:34:26,590
I don't want them!
Get out!

1979
01:34:26,591 --> 01:34:28,092
I want you!

1980
01:34:53,117 --> 01:34:54,618
Lonnie, 3 mai-tais.

1981
01:34:54,619 --> 01:34:55,619
Yes, sir.

1982
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:58,121
Dad, what are you
doing here? Hello, son.

1983
01:34:58,122 --> 01:35:01,125
I sent for him.
It's time you two got things settled.

1984
01:35:01,626 --> 01:35:02,126
Settled?

1985
01:35:02,627 --> 01:35:04,127
Sit down.

1986
01:35:04,128 --> 01:35:07,131
Do you mean to say that you dragged
me all the way over here just...

1987
01:35:07,632 --> 01:35:09,132
What are you
doing here anyway?

1988
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:10,634
I'm here
on business.

1989
01:35:10,635 --> 01:35:12,135
Well, that's
a welcome change.

1990
01:35:12,136 --> 01:35:13,637
What kind
of business?

1991
01:35:13,638 --> 01:35:15,639
Dad, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

1992
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,641
You and mother wanted me
to work for the company.

1993
01:35:17,642 --> 01:35:19,142
Do you still want it?

1994
01:35:19,143 --> 01:35:21,645
Yes. Your mother and I
both want that very much.

1995
01:35:21,646 --> 01:35:23,146
And you, Jack?

1996
01:35:23,147 --> 01:35:24,648
Nothing would
suit me better.

1997
01:35:24,649 --> 01:35:26,650
That leaves me.
What do I want?

1998
01:35:26,651 --> 01:35:28,151
I want independence,

1999
01:35:28,152 --> 01:35:30,153
a chance to prove
I can stand on my own...

2000
01:35:30,154 --> 01:35:32,656
which seems to rule out
working for the company.

2001
01:35:32,657 --> 01:35:35,159
But I think I figured
a way to do both...

2002
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:37,662
work for the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company

2003
01:35:38,162 --> 01:35:39,163
and Chad Gates.

2004
01:35:39,664 --> 01:35:41,164
How many salesmen
you have, Jack?

2005
01:35:41,165 --> 01:35:43,166
- Oh, I don't know.
- 317.

2006
01:35:43,167 --> 01:35:45,669
- Scattered all over the states, right?
- And Canada.

2007
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:48,171
Every year, you have
your annual sales meeting in Atlanta.

2008
01:35:48,172 --> 01:35:49,673
- They all come, don't they?
- Most all.

2009
01:35:50,174 --> 01:35:52,175
Have you ever thought
of how much

2010
01:35:52,176 --> 01:35:53,677
they would look forward
to a trip to Hawaii?

2011
01:35:53,678 --> 01:35:54,958
You could bring them
over here,

2012
01:35:55,179 --> 01:35:57,180
show them how we grow
the fruit, process it,

2013
01:35:57,181 --> 01:35:59,182
let them get a firsthand
taste of Hawaiian sunshine,

2014
01:35:59,183 --> 01:36:00,184
and they'd go back
to their territories

2015
01:36:00,685 --> 01:36:02,185
and sell like
they never sold before.

2016
01:36:02,186 --> 01:36:03,706
Fred, I think the
boy's got something.

2017
01:36:04,188 --> 01:36:05,689
And also special
incentive trips.

2018
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:07,190
Any salesman
who goes over his quota

2019
01:36:07,191 --> 01:36:09,693
gets a week's holiday here,
all expenses paid.

2020
01:36:09,694 --> 01:36:11,195
Why, that's a
crackerjack notion.

2021
01:36:11,696 --> 01:36:13,196
I'll put you
in charge of the whole program.

2022
01:36:13,197 --> 01:36:14,197
I don't want that, Jack.

2023
01:36:14,198 --> 01:36:16,199
I want to go in business
for myself with Maile.

2024
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,201
That's my declaration
of independence.

2025
01:36:18,202 --> 01:36:19,703
I wondered where
I fit into this.

2026
01:36:19,704 --> 01:36:22,205
- Maile, sit down.
- Hello, Maile.

2027
01:36:22,206 --> 01:36:24,207
I'm giving great
Southern this idea.

2028
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:26,209
I expect them to give us
the tourist business.

2029
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:28,211
My partner will
figure out the costs

2030
01:36:28,212 --> 01:36:30,714
and draw up a program
for your approval, ok?

2031
01:36:30,715 --> 01:36:32,215
You've got a deal.

2032
01:36:32,216 --> 01:36:35,185
Chad,
I'm proud of you.

2033
01:36:35,186 --> 01:36:38,221
Lonnie, 4 of those little
tummy-warmers over here.

2034
01:36:38,222 --> 01:36:39,222
Yes, sir.

2035
01:36:39,223 --> 01:36:40,724
How do you feel,
partner?

2036
01:36:40,725 --> 01:36:42,225
Proud and happy.

2037
01:36:42,226 --> 01:36:44,227
"Gates and Duval
Travel Service."

2038
01:36:44,228 --> 01:36:46,229
has a nice ring
to it.

2039
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:48,732
It's too long. Simple.
"Gates of Hawaii."

2040
01:36:48,733 --> 01:36:50,233
Don't I get
any billing?

2041
01:36:50,234 --> 01:36:51,735
Sure. Gates is plural.

2042
01:36:51,736 --> 01:36:54,738
In case you didn't
recognize it, that's a proposal,

2043
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:56,239
and that has
a better ring.

2044
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,741
You're sure?

2045
01:36:57,742 --> 01:37:00,243
I suppose I could be
romantic about it,

2046
01:37:00,244 --> 01:37:02,245
but you'd say yes
anyway.

2047
01:37:02,246 --> 01:37:03,747
You're pretty sure
of yourself.

2048
01:37:03,748 --> 01:37:05,249
Isn't it about time?

2049
01:37:06,751 --> 01:37:07,752
Missa. Missa Gate.

2050
01:37:08,252 --> 01:37:09,252
Uh, Mr. Gate...

2051
01:37:09,253 --> 01:37:10,754
Mr. Gate on line
for you.

2052
01:37:11,255 --> 01:37:13,257
Oh, <i>merci beaucoup,</i>
<i>Ping Pong.</i>

2053
01:37:14,759 --> 01:37:17,260
Hello? Hello, daddy?

2054
01:37:17,261 --> 01:37:18,762
Sarah Lee,
pack your things.

2055
01:37:18,763 --> 01:37:20,263
You're coming over
to Kauai.

2056
01:37:20,264 --> 01:37:22,766
Kauai?
What on earth for?

2057
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:24,769
Don't argue with me,
Sarah Lee!

2058
01:37:25,269 --> 01:37:26,770
You better hurry
over here,

2059
01:37:27,271 --> 01:37:29,273
or you'll miss
your son's wedding.

2060
01:37:29,774 --> 01:37:31,275
Hello?

2061
01:37:31,776 --> 01:37:32,777
Hello?

2062
01:37:33,277 --> 01:37:34,278
Hello?

2063
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,281
Everything ok, Mr. Gate.

2064
01:37:38,282 --> 01:37:41,285
Missa Gate just taking nap,
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

2065
01:37:45,289 --> 01:37:46,790
And did you know

2066
