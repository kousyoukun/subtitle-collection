1
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,500
瑞典
Uh, Sweden.

2
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,966
我们说瑞典语
I'm... I'm... Swedish

3
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,733
但我会说一点英语
but I speak a little English.

4
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:54,800
我们要上船
We're coming on board.

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,100
欢迎大家 欢迎大家
All are welcome. All are welcome.

6
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,266
可爱的小家伙 都上来吧
Even the little one. He can come too.

7
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,733
欢迎
Welcome.

8
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,066
你为什么来这里
Why are you here?

9
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:19,900
一个小小的航海假期
Just a little sailing holiday.

10
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,100
专属男孩之旅
A jolly boys trip.

11
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,333
手拿开
Take your hands off.

12
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
有无文件
Papers?

13
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
护照
Passport?

14
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,066
拿去
Here you go.

15
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,933
船上还有其他人吗
Any other people on the boat?

16
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,100
只有我们两个人
Just the two of us.

17
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:45,600
不
Nein.

18
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:50,100
快来 我们有很多好吃的
Come, come, we have lots to eat...

19
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,000
把你的脏手拿开
Take your dirty hands off me!

20
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,533
退后
Back off!

21
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,466
还有你
And you,

22
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,600
把手举起来
put your hands in the air!

23
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,800
哦
Ooh!

24
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,466
你现在有麻烦了
You're in trouble now!

25
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,133
真是个淘气的孩子
You've been a naughty boy!

26
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,400
我给你100法郎 杀了他
I'll give you 100 francs to shoot him.

27
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,500
别开枪
Don't shoot me!

28
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:28,633
他讨厌德国人 真该一枪毙了他
He hates Germans. You should really shoot him.

29
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,233
对不起 你太吓人了
I... I'm sorry. You are very scary.

30
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,666
让他走板子
Make him walk the plank.

31
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:34,966
他会喜欢的
He loves wood.

32
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,366
肮脏的酒鬼
Dirty drunken animal!

33
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,333
罪名成立
Guilty as charged.

34
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:00,800
我总是带一罐煤油
I always take a can of kerosene

35
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,433
就是为这种场合准备的
for just these sort of occasions.

36
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,466
有一段时间了
It's been a while,

37
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,466
上次有人嘲笑我时
but the last time someone laughed at me

38
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,066
当我登上他们的船时
when I boarded their vessel,

39
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,933
我给了他们选择
I gave them the choice.

40
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,833
要么游上岸
Either swim to shore

41
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,500
要么在船上烧死
or take their chances on a burning ship.

42
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:21,966
汉斯和我都想知道 他们会选择哪种
Hans and I wondered which option they'd choose,

43
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:24,833
死于水或死于火
death by water or death by fire.

44
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,433
但很奇怪 他们都选了
Oddly, they chose both.

45
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,200
他们一直等到最后一刻
They waited until the very last moment,

46
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,700
直到头发着火
until their hair was on fire,

47
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,866
他们的手指被水泡得皮开肉绽
and their blistered skin peeled from their fingers,

48
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,500
在他们浸入水中之前
before they immersed themselves in water

49
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,900
一切都是妄想
in the vain hope

50
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,333
无法到达岸边
of reaching shore.

51
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,800
其中之一
One of them

52
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,900
沉没并葬身鱼腹
sank immediately and perished.

53
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,266
但令我们惊奇的是 他很顽强
But to our amazement, the big one,

54
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,766
表现出了伟大的精神
he showed great spirit.

55
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,733
尽管困难重重
In spite of all the odds...

56
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:06,166
他费尽周折上了岸
...he painstakingly made it to shore.

57
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,533
我们紧随其后 为他欢呼
We followed and cheered him on

58
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,100
并奖励了他 令人印象深刻的一幕
and rewarded this impressive achievement

59
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
用子弹
with a bullet

60
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,433
打穿他的后脑
to the back of his head.

61
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,366
不是很有趣吗
Isn't that funny?

62
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
你为什么不笑
Why aren't you laughing?

63
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,566
干得好 拉森
Nice work, Lassen.

64
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,733
还有更多
There's more where that came from.

65
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
是的
Yes.

66
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,333
啊
Ah...

67
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
不知道有无效果 拉森
Not sure it's working, Lassen.

68
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,333
船长看起来相当激动
The captain looks rather agitated.

69
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,600
他们把枪都拿出来了
They're bringing their guns to bear.

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,866
他们很快就会射到我们 长官
They'll find their range soon, sir.

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,966
弗雷迪 我们应该担心吗
Freddy, should we be worried?

72
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,933
哦 我不这么认为 长官
Oh, I don't think so, sir.

73
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,666
相当大的爆炸物 设置了相当大的引信
It's a rather large explosive, so I set a rather large fuse.

74
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,900
我定位到了房间的外面
I located the outside of the powder room,

75
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,033
所以当它爆炸时
so when it goes bang,

76
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,266
效果应该很棒
it really should go bang.

77
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,600
快一点
Closer...

78
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,933
马上就好了 伙计们
Should be any second now, chaps.

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
弗雷迪
Freddy?

80
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,366
干得好 弗雷德里克
Good work, Frederick.

81
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,700
谢谢你 船长
Thank you, Captain.

82
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,866
现在 能不能告诉我们
Now, any chance you can tell us

83
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,966
我们在这里做什么 长官
what we're doing here, sir?

84
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,133
欧战仍在继续
The war in Europe rages on

85
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:35,566
希特勒和他的纳粹大军横扫千军
as Hitler and his Nazi horde sweep aside all in their path.

86
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,233
波兰 比利时和现在的法国
Poland, Belgium and now France

87
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:41,500
都倒向了希特勒的法西斯政权
have all fallen to Hitler's fascist regime,

88
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,666
留给英国最后的希望
leaving Britain holding up the final hopes

89
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,833
能否解放全欧洲
of liberation for all of Europe.

90
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,400
英国 准备好战斗吧
So, come on, Blighty, get ready for a fighty.

91
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
但我们无法独自做到这一点
But we cannot do it alone.

92
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
来自美国兄弟的帮助
And any hope for our American brothers

93
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,433
从大西洋彼岸加入我们的行列
to join us from across the Atlantic

94
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,966
坏消息
remains frustrated

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,833
德国的秘密武器U型潜艇
by Germany's secret weapon, the U-boat.

96
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,666
俗称致命小潜艇
These deadly little submarines

97
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,500
在北大西洋任意搅局
hunt at will in the North Atlantic.

98
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:07,266
U型潜艇无法被发现 它肆意击沉船只
Undetectable, the U-boat sinks ships indiscriminately,

99
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,033
无论是运载弹药 辎重
whether carrying munitions, provisions

100
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,666
或平民的转移
or civilians heading

101
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,866
来自我们对岸的同伴
from our companions across the pond.

102
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,633
只要U型潜艇还统治着大西洋
So long as the U-boats rule the Atlantic,

103
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,100
一切都不可能
it remains impossible

104
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,966
让美国勇敢的军队到达我们的海岸
for America's brave troops to reach our shores.

105
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:24,166
英国是否会接受希特勒的计划
Will Britain be forced to appease Hitler's plans

106
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,000
还是面临其攻势的毁灭性打击
or face devastation from his offensive?

107
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,866
伦敦在燃烧 大海在变红
London burns and her seas run red,

108
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:32,866
上有炸弹 下有鱼雷
as bombs from above and torpedoes from below

109
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,466
正在肆虐英国人
grind the Brits down.

110
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:37,266
面对这些致命的武器 毫无招架之力
And with no defense against these lethal U-boats,

111
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,233
看来希望渺茫
it appears all hope may be lost

112
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,166
欧洲永无和平
for peace in Europe.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,466
德国人用U型潜艇切断了我们的供应链
The Germans cut off our supply chain with U-boats,

114
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,400
我们切断了U型潜艇的供应链
we cut off the supply chain to the U-boats.

115
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,233
通过情报人员
Through our intelligence agents,

116
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,600
我们找到办法了
we've found a way.

117
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,566
整个
The entire

118
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:04,900
保养 维修和重装
servicing, repairing, and rearming

119
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,766
希特勒的大西洋U型潜艇舰队
of Hitler's Atlantic U-boat fleet...

120
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,600
由两艘纳粹拖船操作
is operated by two Nazi tug boats...

121
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,700
和一艘意大利补给船
and an Italian supply ship in Fernando Po.

122
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,666
我需要人手击沉那些船只
I need men who are willing to go and sink those ships.

123
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,833
我们为什么不直接空袭费尔南多波
Why don't we just air-raid Fernando Po

124
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,033
并击沉船只
and sink the ships?

125
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:28,300
因为德国人很狡猾
Because crafty Germans, being crafty Germans,

126
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,766
将自己掩护于西班牙的殖民地
have positioned themselves in a Spanish colony.

127
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:33,033
费尔南多波是中立地带
Fernando Po is neutral territory.

128
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:35,333
如果我们攻击殖民地
If we attack that colony,

129
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,866
其余未被占领的欧洲将加入纳粹
the rest of unoccupied Europe will join the Nazis,

130
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,033
只是时间问题
and it's only a question of time

131
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,200
在我们找到方法之前
before we find ourselves

132
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,633
只能煎粉红色大香肠
frying big pink sausages

133
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,900
穿着莱德松
wearing nothing but lederhosen.

134
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,766
希特勒不按规矩办事
Hitler is not playing by the rules

135
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
我们也一样
and neither are we.

136
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:52,300
这当然是未经批准的
This will of course be an unsanctioned,

137
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,933
未经授权的非正式任务
unauthorized and unofficial mission.

138
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,900
如果他们被英国人俘虏了
If they're captured by the British,

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,033
会被关进监狱
they'll be thrown in jail.

140
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,000
但如果纳粹找到他们
But if the Nazis find them...

141
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,033
便是折磨和死亡
it's torture and death.

142
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,166
难搞
Somewhat contentiously,

143
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
我可能就是那个人
I may have just the man,

144
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,633
一切颇为不妥
but rather inconveniently,

145
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,233
他目前正被监禁 听候发落

我们可能不喜欢他的态度

147
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,566
但他很大胆 是个杀手

148
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,233
人们会跟随他到任何地方

149
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,433
我们确定这是个好主意吗

150
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:30,833
当然不是

151
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,200
但我们已经走投无路

152
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,200
让他进来
Send him in.

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,666

我为什么在这里

162
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,333
我有一项任务需要你去完成
I have a mission I want you to lead.

163
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:18,466
为什么是我
Why are you asking me, M?

164
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:19,900
请自便 少校
Help yourself to a cup of tea, Major.

165
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,833
他们都知道
We both know that I'm...

166
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:42,833
行政部门不太喜欢我

167
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,166
因为他们觉得你没有吸引力

168
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,966
而我喜欢你的魅力

169
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,466

Without them, they can't dive and they can't hunt.

179
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,333
当浮在水面时 它们就没有威胁了
Stuck on the surface, they're obsolete.

180
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:20,500

赫伦先生已经在那里定居了

我母亲那边是德国犹太人

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,433
很遗憾听到这个消息

再也不用找他们了

I've taken him under my wing ever since.

227

他狡猾 安静 机智

228
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,500
更重要的是
More to the point,

229
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,333
他是个出色的水手 我信任他
Hayes is a magnificent sailor and I trust him.

230
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:31,233
如果我们要试着击沉一艘大船
If we're going to try and sink a large ship,

231
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:34,433
我们需要弗莱迪-巴斯 青蛙人
we'll need Freddy "The Buzz" frogman.

232
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:37,466

He can swim across the channel with his feet tied together.

233
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,233

234
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,000
他是个纵火犯 是个可怕的悲惨人物
he's a convicted arsonist and a terrible misery

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,066
除非他在破坏什么东西

236
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:45,466
但他很擅长把东西炸飞

00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:55,500
在他的家族庄园里狩猎麋鹿

241
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,766
他是一个传奇

242
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:58,966
用一把鲍伊刀和一支弓箭

243
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,166
他18岁离家出走 与纳粹作战
He ran away at 18 to fight the Nazis

244
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,933
在他的兄弟被折磨致死后 他被送进了医院
after the Gestapo tortured his brother to death.

245
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,733
为了给纳粹开膛破肚 他放弃了狩猎
He gave up filleting game for gutting Nazis.

246
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,600
然后 他出现在我们的阵营
He then turned up on our shores

247
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,566
准备与我们并肩作战

248
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,533
他是一个无法控制的疯子
He is an uncontrollable mad dog

249
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,466
百窍生烟
who knows a hundred creative ways

250
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:15,533
内心只有打打杀杀
to kill a man.

251
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,333
最后
And finally,

252
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:21,366
最重要的是 我们需要杰弗里-阿普利亚德
and most importantly, we'll need Geoffrey Appleyard.

253
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:25,400
是的 我们知道你会这么想
Yes, we thought you might.

254
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,266
所以我们派他
That's why we sent him

255
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,733
前往费尔南多波执行侦察任务
on a reconnaissance mission to Fernando Po.

256
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:29,800
不幸的是
Unfortunately,

257
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,300
他在回程时被纳粹抓获
the Nazis nabbed him on his return.

258
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,533
那就更有理由 他知道我们需要知道什么
All the more reason. He knows what we need to know.

259
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,933
他是个策划大师
He's a master planner,

260
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:40,600
幸存者高手 象棋大师
a master survivor, a chess grand master

261
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,066
和一个拿着刀片的外科医生

我们一起在敦刻尔克的散兵坑里待了两周
We spent two weeks together in a Dunkirk foxhole

00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,900
如果没有”苹果” 我今天可能还在那里
and if it wasn't for Apple, I would still be there today.

264
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,900
没有”苹果” 就没有使命
No Apple, no mission.

265
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,166
恐怕这是不可能的
I'm afraid that's impossible.

266
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,166
为什么
Why?

267
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,333
因为他被扣押了
Because he's being held

268
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,000
被拉帕尔马岛上的德国驻军击毙
by an entire German garrison on La Palma.

269
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,466
拉帕尔马就快到了
La Palma's on the way.

270
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,833
太疯狂了 你还让我担心
- That's insanity. - You let me worry about that.

271
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,800
我一定要买一件这样的大衣
I must get me one of those coats.

272
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:45,933
现在 你能不能告诉我们
Now, any chance you can tell us

273
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,066
在这里做什么 长官
what we're doing here, sir?

274
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,266
把你自己擦干 青蛙人 我会告诉你的
Dry yourself off, frogman, and I'll tell you.

275
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:51,333
好奇心正在吞噬我们所有人 长官
The curiosity is eating us all up, sir.

276
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,633
各位 我对你们的保密工作表示歉意
I apologize for all the secrecy, chaps.

277
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,166
但这是
But this is

278
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:05,500
一个未经批准 非官方授权的任务
an unsanctioned, unofficial and unauthorized mission.

279
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,300
如果我们被英国人发现
If we're picked up by the Brits,

280
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
都会坐牢
we will all go to jail.

281
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,833
如果我们被德国人发现
If we're picked up by the Germans,

282
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:12,966
就会是酷刑和死亡
torture and death.

283
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,400
那就只有我们四个了
So, it's just the four of us then?

284
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,700
还有亚普莉亚德上尉
And Captain Appleyard.

285
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,633
他负责保护这些信息
He's responsible for securing this information.

286
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,900
然而 他却陷入了困境
He is, however, in a spot of bother.

287
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,733
他被德国人关押在拉帕尔马岛
He is being held by the Germans on La Palma.

288
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:29,266
我们的首要任务是营救他
Our first job is to liberate him.

289
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:30,900
哦 就这样 是吗 没了
- Oh, so, that's all, is it? - No.

290
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,966
我们需要确认他的情报
We need to confirm Appleyard's intelligence.

291
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,700
这就是为什么还有两个特工
That's why there are two more agents

292
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,300
就在我们谈话时 正乘火车前往费尔南多波
on their way to Fernando Po by train, as we speak.

293
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,766
到底在做什么
Doing what, exactly?

294
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,233
他们要确保
They'll be ensuring

295
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,366
船上装满了补给品
that those ships are filled with supplies,

296
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,433
所以很值得炸掉它们
so they're worth blowing up in the first place.

297
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:52,366
占领是一回事
It's one thing taking over the world,

298
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:54,266
但他们也要接管厨房吗
but do they have to take over the kitchen too?

299
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,933
都是香肠 卷心菜和黑面包
It's all sausage, cabbage and black bread.

300
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,733
你更喜欢哪个
Who would you have preferred?

301
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:04,600
法国人提供的是精致的古典风格
The French offer the refined classical take.

302
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,166
上等牛排 奶酪 黄油
Cote de boeuf, fromage, le beurre...

303
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,533
足够了
ca suffit!

304
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:13,033
意大利人的质朴随性又如何
What about the rustic spontaneity of the Italians?

305
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:19,200
他们的油 扁面条和番茄差点意思
Their oils, the linguine, the tomatoes.

306
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,700
我会跳过扁面条去吃通心粉
I'd climb over the linguine to get to the fettucine.

307
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,300
但是 辛哈雷
But the cinghiale.

308
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,933
嗯
Mmm.

309
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,733
你让我想起了野猪
You have me with the wild boar.

310
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,666
不过 西班牙人的提议
But then again, the Spanish offer

311
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,966
是大杂烩
the smorgasbord

312
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:36,300
当地的海鲜饭和小吃
of the regional paella and tapas.

313
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,533
还有 安达卢西亚伊比利亚火腿
And Jamon Iberico Andalucia.

314
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,700
所以呢
So?

315
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,066
我们左右为难
We're between a rock and a hard place.

316
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,600
如果英国人赢得了战争
If the Brits win the war,

317
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,100
我们只能吃炸鱼和薯条
we're stuck with fish and chips.

318
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,166
如果德国人赢得了战争
If the Germans win the war,

319
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,300
我们就只能点这个菜单了
we're stuck with this menu.

320
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,466
所以呢
So?

321
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,266
我们会有香肠 卷心菜
We'll have the sausage, the cabbage

322
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,233
和黑面包
and the black bread please.

323
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,300
非常好 谢谢
Tres bien. Merci.

324
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
目前的情况
Our situation?

325
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,933
稍等
Steady.

326
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,666
稍等
Steady.

327
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:42,100
现在
Now.

328
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:55,966
嗯
Mmm.

329
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,966
我累坏了
I'm exhausted.

330
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,400
请注意些
Entschuldigung, bitte.

331
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,133
停下
Halt!

332
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,600
有问题吗
Is there a problem?

333
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,200
我自己能行 谢谢
I can manage myself, thank you.

334
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,766
我来吧 斯图尔特小姐
Allow me, Miss Stewart.

335
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,333
请吧
Allow me.

336
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,933
谢谢
Thank you.

337
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:31,566
普罗斯特

338
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:48,733

正在努力
Working on it.

342
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
长官 请讲

345
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,500
杜奇莎的清单准备好了吗
Duchessa's manifest. Ready?

346
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,633
准备就绪400枚B级鱼雷 确认

5,000 tons of diesel.

352
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,100

把车准备好 通知弗莱明
Get the car ready. Inform Fleming.

361
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:15,633
收拾一下吧
Let's pack it up.

362
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,400
抢银行没意义
No point robbing the bank

363
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,100
如果金库里没有黄金
if there's no gold in the vault.

364
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,033
谢谢
Thank you.

365
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,333
让人感到欣慰的是
It's truly comforting to know

366
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,133
世界上至少还有一位绅士
there's at least one gentleman in the world.

367
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,066
白痴
Ah! Idiot!

368
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:38,600
再见
Good day.

369
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,433
香肠 卷心菜和黑面包
Sausage, cabbage and black bread.

370
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,300
希特勒向我们开出了条件
Hitler has made us an offer.

371
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,633
一种绥靖政策
An appeasement.

372
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,666
但我们必须撤军
But we must step down our army,

373
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,766
交出海军 接受纳粹统治
surrender our Navy and accept Nazi rule.

374
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,733
否则 他将
Otherwise, he promises

375
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:16,533
彻底摧毁英国
total destruction of Britain and her empire.

376
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:18,533
我们的最佳选择是
Our best option

377
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,600
趁我们还活着 接受希特勒的交易
is to take Hitler's deal while we can.

378
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,333
空军元帅表示同意
The Air Marshal agrees.

379
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:28,900
他有更多的炸弹 人员 武器
He has more bombs, more men, more machines.

380
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:30,966
我们坚持不了多久
We won't survive much longer.

381
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:34,266
你必须做出决定
You have to make the only decision you can make

382
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,966
凭良心说 首相
in good conscience, Prime Minister.

383
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
天啊 听听你们自己说的话
Good God, girls. Listen to yourselves.

384
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,866
这不是绥靖政策 而是投降
It's not appeasement, it's surrender.

385
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,366
还是没有意识到对手是谁
You still fail to realize who we're up against.

386
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,100
恕我直言 首相 是您没有意识到这一点
With respect, Prime Minister, it's you who doesn't realize.

387
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,533
我们不能指望打败他
We cannot hope to defeat him.

388
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,333
希特勒是邪恶之人
Hitler is the mainspring of evil,

389
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,433
一个吝啬鬼
a guttersnipe.

390
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,433
不是一个可以与之谈判的人
This is not a man that we can negotiate with.

391
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:59,366
我读过他的书
I've read his book, Admiral Pound.

392
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:02,300
他是一个恶毒的 意识形态主义者
The man is a vicious, victimized ideologue.

393
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:03,433
他不可信
He cannot be trusted.

394
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,266
如果我们可以实现和平
If I thought that we could've achieved peace

395
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:08,766
通过投降的话
through surrendering,

396
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,300
我早就做了
I'd have done it already.

397
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,600
我要让国家不再妥协
We need to stop our country from starving.

398
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,000
我们需要300万吨物资
We need three million tons of supplies

399
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:17,433
穿越大西洋
to cross the Atlantic every month.

400
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,800
目前U型潜艇的攻击 使我们损失了其中50%
We are currently losing 50% of that to U-boat attacks.

401
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,533
接受交易的另一个原因
Another reason to take the deal.

402
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:24,800
我还没说完呢 阿尔吉侬 亲爱的
I've not finished, Algernon, darling.

403
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:28,033
我们需要美国人
We need the Americans,

404
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,833
他们永远不会参战
and they will never enter the war

405
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,800
如果我们看起来已经是失败的一方
if we already appear to be a losing side.

406
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,100
结束与德国的敌对行动
Ending hostilities with Germany

407
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,400
是摆脱困境的最佳途径
is the best path out of this mess.

408
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,333
我们都同意 首相
We are all in agreement, Prime Minister.

409
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:41,533
谢谢各位
Thank you, gentlemen.

410
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,166
是的 谢谢你们 先生们
Yes, thank you, gentlemen!

411
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,200
弗莱明 最好是好消息
M, Fleming, this better be good news.

412
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,333
首相
Prime Minister,

413
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,200
我们这里有清单
we have the manifest here, sir.

414
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,733
已经过确认
It's been confirmed

415
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,800
公爵夫人号满载物资
the Duchessa is fully laden with supplies

416
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,833
让U型潜艇无限期地继续作战
to keep the U-boats operational indefinitely.

417
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:07,600
如果我们要击沉她 正是时候
If we're going to sink her, now is the time.

418
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,000
他们在路上了
They're on their way.

419
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,500
机会呢
And their chances?

420
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:14,500
如果有人能做到 他们也能做到
Well, if anyone can, they can.

421
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,766
但如果我们被发现
But if we're discovered,

422
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,766
议会将解除您的职务
parliament will remove you from office.

423
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,900
好吧
Well,

424
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,766
我们最好不被发现
we'd better make sure we're not discovered then.

425
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,366
我们将从悬崖边出发
We'll take it from the cliffside.

426
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:35,666
这是一个85英尺高的陡峭攀岩
It's an 85-foot sheer climb.

427
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,833
没有人会注意到
No one should notice

428
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,000
一艘无害的小渔船
a small, innocuous fishing vessel.

429
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,433
我们将在树林里设点 看会遇到什么
We'll set up in the woods and see what we're up against,

430
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,533
然后再去夜袭
then we'll go for a night raid.

431
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:46,200
悄悄溜进去 找到苹果 快速出来
Slip in quietly, find Apple, come out fast.

432
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,066
目标数字呢
Numbers?

433
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,533
情报显示 驻军有50至 60 人
Intelligence suggests a garrison of 50 to 60.

434
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,833
每人对付15个
That should be about 15 each.

435
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:57,400
拉森 别太贪心 你确实名声在外
Lassen, try not to be greedy. You do have a reputation.

436
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,866
我杀人的日子结束了
My killing days are over.

437
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:02,100
只是作为维和观察员来这里
I'm just here as a peacekeeping observer.

438
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,900
弗雷迪 把工具包起来 全部收起来
Freddy, bag the kit, silence the weapons.

439
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:52,866
我们什么时候出发
When do we go?

440
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,733
0200
0200.

441
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,433
先攻下塔楼 然后进入无线电室
Take the towers first, then move onto the radio room,

442
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,633
接着军营 最后来到控制室
barracks and end up in the control room...

443
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:03,833
这里有什么
What do we have here?

444
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,433
纳粹秘密警察
Gestapo.

445
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,166
你怎么知道
How'd you know?

446
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,166
他们越坏 穿得就越好
The badder they are, the better they're dressed.

447
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,366
我真得买一件这样的大衣了
I really must get me one of those coats.

448
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:13,933
他们一定是为苹果而来
They must be here for Apple.

449
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:18,166
要么拷问 要么 呃 长官
It's either torture or, uh, extraction, sir.

450
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,466
如果他们把他带走 苹果就完了
If they extract him, it'll be the end of Apple.

451
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:21,633
我们不会再见到他了
We won't be seeing him again.

452
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,966
恐怕不太好 先生们
I'm afraid, gentlemen,

453
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:25,633
我们不可能奢望夜晚来临
we're not going to have the luxury of night.

454
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:26,933
我们得进去了
We're going to have to go in now.

455
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,266
那么 发生了什么
So, what's happened there then?

456
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,500
看起来像
It looks like

457
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,633
它们被射满了箭
they've been plugged full of arrows, Haysey.

458
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,900
那么 箭头去哪儿了
Well, where did the arrows go?

459
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,166
直接穿过去了
Straight through them.

460
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,200
另一边还有两个
There were two more round the other side.

461
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,366
他们现在在哪
Where are they now?

462
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,333
和这边一样
Same place as these two.

463
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,800
纳粹天堂
Nazi heaven.

464
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,433
我们还有不到七分钟的时间
Well, we've got less than seven minutes

465
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,733
以免错过
before they're missed.

466
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,966
警报 狗都是麻烦
Alarms, dogs. None of it good.

467
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:05,700
潜入内部
Go undercover of the engine.

468
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,500
只有当事情发生时 才能打破掩护
Only break cover when things go bang.

469
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,533
我有个好主意 拉森
I have a great idea, Lassen.

470
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:14,200
你为什么不自己走呢
Why don't you march off by yourself

471
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,766
让德国人满身是箭
and fill those Germans full of arrows?

472
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,533
弗莱迪 拿起剪刀 把栅栏剪开
Freddy, grab the scissors and help him with that fence.

473
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,633
是 长官
Aye, sir.

474
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:51,566
跟我来 我们往左走
Haysey, you're with me. We go left.

475
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:54,366
弗雷迪 拉森 你们右走
Freddy, Lassen, you go right.

476
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,100
先生们 把靴子穿上 祝你们玩得愉快
Fill your boots, gentlemen, and bon appetit.

477
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,733
塔上见
See you at the tower.

478
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,533
请记住 先生们 尽量玩得开心
And remember, gentlemen, try to have fun.

479
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,966
到目前为止 一切顺利
So far, so good.

480
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:46,733
干得不错
Doing rather well, Haysey.

481
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:47,833
哦 谢谢
Oh, why thank you, sir.

482
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:06,933
非常好
It's very good.

483
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,966
看起来不需要躲避了
Sounds like stealth mode's over.

484
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,066
趴下
Haysey, down!

485
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,233
不不
Nein! Nein!

486
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:30,400
我们认识吗
Do we know each other?

487
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:32,500
不
No.

488
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,000
那是心脏吗 拉森
Is that a heart, Lassen?

489
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,800
为免生疑
For the avoidance of doubt.

490
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,100
苹果 老伙计
Apple, old boy.

491
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,600
格斯 看来你们见过了
- Gus. - I see you two have met.

492
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,300
我是海斯
This is Haysey.

493
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:01,900
很荣幸 海斯 是我的荣幸
- Pleasure, Haysey. - Pleasure's mine.

494
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,233
我想你可能需要这些
I thought you might need these.

495
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,066
你想得真周到
Jolly thoughtful of you.

496
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,166
你们都找到他了
You all find him?

497
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,800
哦 太好了
Oh, goody.

498
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,700
该死的 你的奶子怎么了
Bloody hell, what happened to your nipples?

499
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,833
你没事吧
You all right?

500
00:34:19,866 --> 00:34:22,266
你就不能拔掉我的插头吗 电池还开着呢
Couldn't unplug me, could you? Battery's still on.

501
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:41,900
你看到公爵夫人了吗
Did you see the Duchessa,

502
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:44,700
拖船吗
the tug boats?

503
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:47,000
还有很多纳粹士兵
And rather a lot of Nazi soldiers.

504
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,933
为什么你的报告中 没有提到这一点
Why wasn't that in your report?

505
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:54,033
因为那些士兵和枪
Because those soldiers and those guns,

506
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,700
这些S型潜艇都是新造的
and those S-Boats are all new.

507
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
这比期待中的要多得多
That's a lot more than the boys are expecting.

508
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:03,800
一个月前 有十几名机械师
A month ago, it was a dozen mechanics.

509
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,000
六个醉醺醺的水手
Six drunk sailors.

510
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:06,233
两个胖西班牙人
Two fat Spaniards.

511
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,966
还有纳粹份子
And a Nazi in a pear tree.

512
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,433
我得说 需要更多的帮助
I'd say, we're gonna need more help.

513
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,033
交给我吧
You leave that to me.

514
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,366
当然
Of course.

515
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,800
但现在
But right now...

516
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:24,000
你得见见那个人
...you need to meet that man.

517
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,466
你的男人 来这里的原因
Your man. The reason you're here.

518
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:31,266
啊
Ah.

519
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,366
唯一比纳粹可怕的
The only thing worse than a Nazi...

520
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
就是他
is him.

521
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,433
我很失望 赫伦
I'm very disappointed, Heron.

522
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,700
我的仓库里有16个箱子
There are 16 crates in my warehouse

523
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:10,333
你们尚未运往大陆
you have not yet shipped to the mainland.

524
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,466
不用担心 先生
No need to fret, Herr Luhr.

525
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:13,666
它们仍会在约定日期前送达
They'll still be delivered by the agreed date.

526
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,066
也许吧
That may be.

527
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,400
但它们占用了宝贵的时间
But they take up valuable space.

528
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:18,500
为此 我期望
For this, I expect

529
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,666
大幅减少您的费用
a significant reduction in your fee.

530
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,866
我能做到减少5%
I can do 5%...

531
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,466
以示友好
...as a gesture of goodwill.

532
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,033
二十块 别浪费我宝贵的时间讨价还价了
Twenty. And don't waste my precious time haggling.

533
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,166
严格来说
Well, strictly speaking,

534
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,533
不应减少
there should be no reductions,

535
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,900
因为还没有任何违约行为
since there's not yet been any breach of contract.

536
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:38,200
5个字 已经很客气 20个字 就像酸溜溜的音符
Five is more than polite, 20 rings like a sour note,

537
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,000
那些罐子
it jars.

538
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,500
会结冰
It jars?

539
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:44,966
我被指责不友好吗
Am I being accused of disharmony?

540
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:47,400
我认为这是对我个人的侮辱
I take that as a personal affront.

541
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,900
我猜你不是秘书
And I am supposing you are not the secretary.

542
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,133
斯图尔特小姐 我说过要安排的联系人
Miss Stewart is the contact I said I'd arrange.

543
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:59,600
啊 你的纽约黄金联系人
Ah, your New York gold contact?

544
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:01,900
我告诉过你
I told you,

545
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:04,233
我已经有了满意的安排
I already have a satisfying arrangement.

546
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,133
请坐
Have a seat.

547
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,300
谢谢
Thank you.

548
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:14,233
希望我不会让你失望
Well, I hope I don't disappoint.

549
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,500
我无法就这次交谈做出决定
I can't make a decision on this presentation.

550
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,533
早点的话
Early days.

551
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,500
好吧 如果来得太早的话
Well, if early days do come too soon,

552
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:25,500
猎人之月 四季更迭
and seasons change with a Hunter's Moon.

553
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:34,533
嗯
Hmm.

554
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:37,000
嗯
Hmm.

555
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:37,900
我不得不说
I have to say, Heron,

556
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:39,600
你所有的缺点
for all your flaws,

557
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,700
确实有从帽子里掏兔子的习惯
you do have a habit of pulling rabbits from hats.

558
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,500
那么 你想转移多少黄金呢
So, how much gold do you wish to move,

559
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,600
斯图尔特小姐
Miss Stewart?

560
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,866
有多少是多少
As much as you can find.

561
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,366
正如我之前提到的
As I mentioned before,

562
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:05,333
已经有一个非常有利可图的安排
I do already have a very profitable arrangement.

563
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:07,900
尽管有你的说法
And despite of your commentary,

564
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:10,366
我为自己能保持冷静而自豪
I pride myself on maintaining harmony.

565
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:14,333
我为什么要招待你
Now, why should I entertain you?

566
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:19,566
因为你会赚更多的钱 享受更多的乐趣
Because you'll make more money and have lots of fun

567
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
与此同时
whilst doing so.

568
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:25,800
如果我说话不算数 无需给钱
If I'm not good for my word, don't pay me.

569
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:42,966
好样的
Bravo.

570
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:47,233
我会和他们谈谈 再会
I will talk to my people and then we'll rendezvous.

571
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:49,033
真可爱
Lovely.

572
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:55,366
当狡猾的红猫在黎明吠叫时
When the sly red cat barks at dawn,

573
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:57,266
杀人只为取乐
and kills just for her pleasure,

574
00:39:57,366 --> 00:40:00,200
猫偷吃的饭菜由谁分享
who shares the meal the cat did steal

575
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,566
当两个人都看得津津有味时
when both looked on in pleasure?

576
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:05,466
再见
Auf wiedersehen.

577
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:54,266
谜语是一个很好的点子
The riddle was a nice touch.

578
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,233
上钩了
The hook's in.

579
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:04,100
现在要小心把他卷进来
Now be careful how you reel him in.

580
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,666
我会确保港口空无一人
I'll make sure the harbor's empty

581
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,900
当他们到达时
when the boys arrive.

582
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,333
你打算怎么做
How are you going to do that?

583
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:23,700
我会在俱乐部举办一个派对
I'll throw a party at my club.

584
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,966
军官舞会
A costume party for the officers

585
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,933
并在码头为士兵们举行了第二次聚会
and a second party at the dock for the soldiers.

586
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:30,766
人们喜欢我的派对
People like my parties.

587
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:33,100
除了鲁尔
Everyone but Luhr.

588
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:35,700
这是你的工作
That will be your job.

589
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,500
所有的老鼠都会跟着吹笛者走
All the rats will follow the piper.

590
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,466
所以 如果我理解正确的话
So, if I understand correctly,

591
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:47,933
现在在拉帕尔马
we're currently here in La Palma.

592
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:49,900
我们将环绕德国控制的非洲航行
We'll sail around German-controlled Africa

593
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,933
到费尔南多波
to Fernando Po,

594
00:41:51,066 --> 00:41:52,766
它位于赤道以北
which is just north of the Equator,

595
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:54,666
在西非海岸附近
just off the West African coast.

596
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,600
这是最短的路线
So that's the shortest route?

597
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,166
是的 但我们不想走得太快
Yes, but we don't want to go shorter.

598
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,166
我们的首要任务是不被发现
Our priority is not to be seen.

599
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,766
你是说 被人发现
You mean, be seen again.

600
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:05,933
又来了 现在有点马虎了
Again? Getting a little sloppy on us now, Gussy?

601
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:07,333
已经交谈过了
Had a run-in already?

602
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,033
别管我们 苹果 老伙计
Never mind us, Apple, old boy.

603
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,433
再次提醒
Remind me again

604
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:12,933
你是怎么发现自己的乳头连着汽车电池
how you found your nipples attached to a car battery.

605
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,900
是的 不是我的错
Yes. Wasn't my fault.

606
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,633
智力低下 另外 这几乎是值得的
Bad intelligence. Plus it was almost worth it

607
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:19,033
观看 捕心者 的工作
to watch the heart-snatcher at work.

608
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:21,033
与其说我是个战士 不如说我是个情人
I'm better known as a lover than a fighter.

609
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:22,366
天哪
Jesus Christ!

610
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,966
如果这就是你的战斗方式 我真不想看到
If that's how you fight, I'd hate to see you love.

611
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:25,333
你不必担心这个
You don't have to worry about that,

612
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,533
你对我来说太漂亮了
you're too pretty for me.

613
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:30,500
而弗雷迪
Freddy, on the other hand...

614
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,466
你得先抓住我
You'd have to catch me first.

615
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:35,566
我确实喜欢打猎
I do love to hunt.

616
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
你会很幸运的
You'd be lucky.

617
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:40,466
我真的越来越热了
I'm really getting quite hot.

618
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,333
总之 建议是 走这条更宽广的道路
Anyway, my suggestion is that we take this wider route.

619
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,800
显然更长
It's obviously longer

620
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,666
但应避免危机
but it should avoid any awkward conversations

621
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,566
德国U型潜艇或英国军舰
with German U-boats or British warships.

622
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,766
视天气而定
Weather-dependent,

623
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,500
我们应该在15天内到达那里
we should make it there in 15 days.

624
00:42:52,566 --> 00:42:53,800
同意
Agreed.

625
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,500
海斯 你觉得能做到吗
Haysey, do you think you could manage that?

626
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:57,566
交给我吧 长官
Leave it to me, sir.

627
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,166
照我说的做
Just do as you're told

628
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,700
再给我倒一杯
and get me another drink!

629
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,866
上尉 长官
Captain, sir.

630
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,300
要吃点什么吗
Can I get you something to eat?

631
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,666
我可以 这边请
May I... Come this way.

632
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:29,766
把你的手拿开
Take your hands off me.

633
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:33,533
你知道的
You know,

634
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
我喜欢你 费米
I like you, Femi.

635
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,966
但你要是再碰我一下 就得进监狱
But you touch me again and you're going to jail.

636
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,033
费米
Femi.

637
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:48,400
我来吧
I'll deal with him.

638
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,866
请照顾好斯图尔特小姐
Please take care of Miss Stewart.

639
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,433
你知道需要什么吗 比尼亚上尉
You know what you need, Captain Binea?

640
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,566
我知道我需要什么
I know what I need.

641
00:43:57,366 --> 00:44:00,233
但是你呢 里卡多
But do you, Ricardo?

642
00:44:01,766 --> 00:44:03,300
你得再喝一杯
You need another drink.

643
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:07,066
马蒂
Marty,

644
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,633
好东西
good stuff.

645
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:11,100
里卡多 这就是我爱你的原因
Ricardo, that's why I love you.

646
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:13,466
你懂的
You understand.

647
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,600
这里是费尔南多波
This is Fernando Po.

648
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:17,933
欢迎大家
Everybody's welcome.

649
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:21,233
嗯 大家
Si... Everybody.

650
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,133
我觉得人太多了
Too many body I think.

651
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:29,133
阿曼多
Armando?

652
00:44:30,733 --> 00:44:32,600
你和我们的新朋友闹翻了吗
Have you fallen out with our new friends?

653
00:44:32,633 --> 00:44:34,433
这不公平 里卡多
It's not fair, Ricardo.

654
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:36,600
这是我的港湾
This is my harbor.

655
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,300
我说了算
I am in charge.

656
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,666
他们踩到你的脚趾了吗
Are they stepping on your toes?

657
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,366
它们不踩踏 而是踩踏
They don't step, they stamp!

658
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,066
他们什么也没告诉比尼亚队长
They tell Captain Binea nothing.

659
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,033
现在我才知道
Only now do I hear

660
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:50,633
公爵夫人号提前离港
the Duchessa is leaving the harbor early.

661
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,300
很好 做得好
Well, good riddance.

662
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,066
海港将再次属于你
The harbor will be yours again.

663
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,633
你什么时候才能摆脱那个丑陋的家伙
When will you be free of that ugly vessel?

664
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,633
三天前
Three days earlier.

665
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:06,633
那我们应该再喝一杯
Then we should have another drink.

666
00:45:07,933 --> 00:45:09,966
庆祝 马蒂
To celebrate. Marty...

667
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:11,900
为我们的港务局首长再来一次
Another round for our Harbor Master.

668
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,133
那么 上尉 你知道他们想搬到哪里去吗
So, Captain, do you know where they wish to relocate?

669
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:20,500
杀人取乐的既不是猫 也不是狗
It's neither cat nor dog that kills for fun,

670
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:23,666
是狐狸精 不是别人
it's the vixen, not another.

671
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,233
只有两个人 以杀人为乐
There's only two that kill for fun,

672
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:29,500
我漂亮的朋友
my pretty friend,

673
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:32,600
狐狸和他的人类兄弟
the fox and his human brother.

674
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,666
我相信已经解开了你的小谜题
I believe I have resolved your little riddle.

675
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:56,200
干杯 做得好
Chapeau. You play well.

676
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,900
说到狐狸
Speaking of foxes,

677
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:05,733
霍洛维茨和梅耶 西街47
Horowitz and Meyer, West 47th Street.

678
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
你听说过他们吗
Have you heard of them?

679
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:09,900
我想没有 没有
I don't believe I have, no.

680
00:46:43,966 --> 00:46:45,500
他们是最大的黄金交易商
They're the largest gold traders

681
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,400
在纽约城
in Midtown New York

682
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,733
你却没听说过他们
and you haven't heard of them?

683
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:51,600
恐怕没有
I'm afraid I haven't, no.

684
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,266
我当然熟悉霍洛维茨和哈伊姆
I am familiar, of course, with Horowitz and Haim.

685
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,633
但他们在城市的西边
But they're in the west side of the city.

686
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,600
不过话说回来
But then again,

687
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,333
我相信你已经知道了 不是吗
I'm sure you already knew that, didn't you?

688
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,800
我很好奇
I'm curious,

689
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:15,366
您觉得如何与犹太人打交道
how do you find dealing with the Jew?

690
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,633
哦 天哪
Oh, dear.

691
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:20,166
我从一个陷阱中滑落
I've slipped from one snare

692
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,600
却发现自己身处另一个世界
only to find myself in another.

693
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
我该怎么说呢
How shall I put this?

694
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:26,733
我担心你们杰出的领导人
I fear your brilliant leader

695
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:28,833
对古代雅胡达部落的描述有误
has mischaracterized the ancient tribe of Jahuda.

696
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:31,000
他们不仅能够
Their ability to not only

697
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:33,700
脖子上套着一只靴子 也能活3000 年
survive 3,000 years with a boot on their neck,

698
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:37,133
但尽管如此 也会繁荣昌盛
but to prosper in spite of it...

699
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:39,800
我怀疑激发了他内心中撒旦般的嫉妒
I suspect it inspired satanic jealousy within him.

700
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:42,066
总之
In conclusion,

701
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,466
看样子
it looks as though

702
00:47:44,466 --> 00:47:47,033
这位女士懂得太多了
the lady doth protest too much.

703
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:54,700
亵渎神明的蛋糕上还有樱桃吗
Is there a cherry to go on this blasphemous cake,

704
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,100
还是你已经完成了
or have you finished?

705
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:03,166
我必须承认
I must confess,

706
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:05,666
我不仅尊敬和钦佩犹太人
not only do I respect and admire the Jew...

707
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:09,666
我就是
I am one.

708
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,300
开个玩笑
Kidding!

709
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,833
他们是贪婪的老鼠
They're greedy rats.

710
00:48:38,866 --> 00:48:40,000
我认为这可能是
I think this could be

711
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,900
一段美好友谊的开始
the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

712
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,200
那就开个派对庆祝一下
Then I shall throw a party to celebrate.

713
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,200
我不喜欢派对
I don't care for parties.

714
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,733
哦 扫兴鬼 大家都喜欢派对
Oh, spoilsport! Everybody loves a party.

715
00:48:53,466 --> 00:48:55,166
公爵夫人离开了
The Duchessa's leaving

716
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,933
比我们想象的早了三天
three days earlier than we thought.

717
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,666
如果我们不告诉他们
If we don't tell the Maid Honor,

718
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:00,866
会来得太晚
they'll arrive too late.

719
00:49:11,566 --> 00:49:12,800
来了
Incoming.

720
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,400
联系中
Contact.

721
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,900
岛上的杰里人比预期的要多
More Jerries on the island than expected.

722
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:21,733
储藏室里的罐装腌牛肉
Tin of corned beef's out of pantry

723
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:23,633
提前三天到达
three days early.

724
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:28,966
我要这个
I'll take that.

725
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,733
这是机密 长官 只对M保密
It's confidential, sir. For M only.

726
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,733
在进行破译时
When it comes to make the extraction,

727
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:34,800
它必须是一个非常
it needs to be a very...

728
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:35,933
长官 有留言
Sir. Message, sir.

729
00:49:40,066 --> 00:49:43,166
岛上的杰里人比预期的要多
More Jerries on the island than expected.

730
00:49:45,533 --> 00:49:46,800
腌牛肉从储藏室里拿出来了
Corned beef's out of the pantry

731
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,900
提前三天
three days early.

732
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:51,033
走快点
Move faster.

733
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:53,400
是的 但该地区发现的U型潜艇越来越多
Yes, but there's increased U-boat sightings in the area.

734
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
长官
Sir.

735
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,700
任务还在继续
The mission's still proceeding.

736
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:08,700
所以 岛上有更多的士兵
So, there's more soldiers on the island

737
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,766
船会提前出发吗
and the boat's leaving earlier?

738
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,133
是的
Yes.

739
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:12,600
那么 我们如何才能走得更快
Well, how are we meant to move faster?

740
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,766
我们不能再快了
We can't move faster.

741
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,566
我们正以最快的速度前进
We're going as fast as we can.

742
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,633
这是一艘渔船 不是快艇
This is a fishing boat, it's not a speedboat.

743
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,866
首相
Prime Minister,

744
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:21,733
公爵夫人将在12天后离开费尔南多波
the Duchessa's leaving Fernando Po in 12 days.

745
00:50:21,766 --> 00:50:23,366
我们目前的日程安排是
On our current schedule,

746
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:24,933
他们会晚到三天
they'll arrive three days too late.

747
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,500
还能这样做吗
Can it still be done?

748
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:30,266
我们仍在等待答复
We're still awaiting a response

749
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:31,266
来自菲利普斯少校
from Major Phillips.

750
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,200
如果我们不能走得更快 那就要换短路线
If we can't move faster, we'll go shorter.

751
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,833
我们可以在12天内到达费尔南多波
We can get to Fernando Po in 12 days.

752
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,533
等等 你说我们不能走这条路线
Hold on, you said we couldn't go shorter.

753
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:40,800
不 我说我们不想走得太危险
No, I said we don't want to go shorter.

754
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,033
我们会被U型潜艇击沉
He said we'll get mowed down by a U-boat.

755
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:46,433
或者更糟的是 被英国人抓走
Or worse, picked up by the Brits.

756
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:48,333
他们的驱逐舰队正在穿过那里
Their armada of destroyers are crossing there.

757
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:50,866
我们将在U型潜艇上方航行
We will literally be sailing over U-boats.

758
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,100
对不起 伙计们 我们走得比较危险
Sorry, lads, we go shorter.

759
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:20,266
三 二 一
Drei, zwei, eins...

760
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,566
先生们 我想说
Gentlemen, as I speak to you now,

761
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:47,166
再次来到伦敦
London once again

762
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:49,866
在纳粹从天而降的攻击下瑟瑟发抖
shudders beneath a Nazi onslaught from the skies.

763
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,200
在这种时候
And at such times,

764
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:55,333
人们的内心被激起责任感
the hearts of men are stirred to duty.

765
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,800
但你们不是那样的人
But you are not such men.

766
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:58,433
你没有被选中
You were not chosen

767
00:51:58,466 --> 00:52:01,633
为您的显赫荣誉或崇高理想
for your conspicuous honor or high ideals.

768
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:02,700
如果你被选中
You were chosen

769
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,633
因为你是最后一击
because you are the last resort.

770
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:05,800
赋予你们的使命
The mission you have been given

771
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:09,400
这是前所未有的
is of a sort never before undertaken.

772
00:52:09,433 --> 00:52:13,600
需要冷酷无情的人 毫不犹豫的人
It demands ruthless men, who will not hesitate

773
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,766
屈从于战争惯例
to stoop beneath the conventions of war.

774
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,866
手中握有鲜血的人
Men who do not keep clean hands.

775
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,500
像你这样的人
Men like you.

776
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:25,333
然而 谁还在密谋
And yet, who still conspire

777
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,900
在不和谐的言语中
in their own discordant harmony.

778
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:32,733
他们知道自己一去不复返 却毫不在意
Who know and yet do not care that they may never return.

779
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:36,000
不为荣耀而前进的人
And who press onward not for glory,

780
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:38,400
或为职责 或为他人
or for duty, or for me,

781
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,066
但因为你们 是永不停息的人
but because you are men who will not stop

782
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:42,100
直到完成战斗为止
until it is done.

783
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,600
祝你们一路顺风 先生们
Godspeed, gentlemen.

784
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,600
呃
Uh... Chaps...

785
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,100
那是一艘英国驱逐舰
That's a British destroyer.

786
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,633
我们该走了
We should move.

787
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,133
我们无法避开的 长官
We can't outrun that, sir.

788
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:13,133
我们见过他 他也见过我们
Well, we've seen them, they've seen us.

789
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,066
坚持住
Hold fast, Maid Honor.

790
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,833
我们正在准备登船队伍
We're preparing a boarding party.

791
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,133
你好 船长
Hello, Captain!

792
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,500
没什么令人兴奋的
Nothing exciting here.

793
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,500
我们只是瑞典渔民
We're just Swedish fishermen.

794
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,133
上前 约根森
Step forward, Jorgensen!

795
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:34,266
约根森 你是瑞典人
Jorgensen, you're Swedish.

796
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,933
问问他们要去哪里 好吗
Ask them where they're heading, would you?

797
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,166
不是你 拉森
Not you, Lassen.

798
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,166
呃
Uh...

799
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,233
我想听听马奇菲利普斯的意见
I want to hear March-Phillips have a go.

800
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:49,033
啊
Ah.

801
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:52,866
有道理
Fair enough.

802
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,066
游戏开始了 指挥官
Game's up, Commander.

803
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,666
不能责怪一个女孩的努力
Can't blame a girl for trying.

804
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,066
干得好 少校
Good effort, Major.

805
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,266
但恐怕你得跟我们走一趟
But I'm afraid you are going to have to come with us.

806
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:02,066
请问
May I ask under whose authority

807
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:03,700
我们被劫持了吗
we've been waylaid?

808
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:05,200
奉庞德上将之命
On the orders of Admiral Pound.

809
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,166
中尉
First Lieutenant.

810
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,266
您正在追击
You are pursuing

811
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:15,033
不法犯罪团伙
an unsanctioned criminal enterprise

812
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:17,500
在国际水域
in international waters.

813
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,533
会引起一场混乱
You're going to cause an upset.

814
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:23,133
我想已经有点不高兴了 指挥官
I think we're a little past upset, Commander.

815
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:24,433
史蒂文斯 你有什么发现
Stevens, what have you got?

816
00:54:24,466 --> 00:54:25,800
我听到了乒乒乓乓的声音 长官
I had a ping, sir.

817
00:54:26,866 --> 00:54:28,133
贪婪的小纳粹
The greedy little Nazi

818
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,733
不会满足于控制欧洲大部分地区
won't be satisfied with holding most of Europe,

819
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:33,266
他的目标是我们的绿色宜人之地
he's after our own green and pleasant land.

820
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,666
谢天谢地 你来了
Well, thank God you're here

821
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,966
带着你的小木头战舰
with your little wooden battleship

822
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,200
和你的五人军队
and your five-man army.

823
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,300
U型潜艇方位 273
U-boat, bearing 273.

824
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,366
敲响警钟
Sound the alarm.

825
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,866
上船吧
Come aboard.

826
00:54:43,866 --> 00:54:45,766
U型潜艇接近中右舷 长官
U-boat approaching. Starboard side, sir.

827
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,766
战斗就位
Battle stations!

828
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:50,366
少校 也是为了你好
Major, if you know what's good for you,

829
00:54:50,366 --> 00:54:52,100
回去吧 很好 指挥官
- you'll head home. - Very good, Commander.

830
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,866
海斯 让我们远离鱼雷磁铁
Haysey, get us away from that torpedo magnet

831
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,200
尽快
as quickly as possible.

832
00:54:55,233 --> 00:54:57,666
是 长官 苹果 去船尾
Aye, sir. Apple, man the stern.

833

弗雷迪 在主帆上

00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,366
快点 伙计们
Quickly now, lads!

837
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:07,466
为我们升起前帆 好吗 伙计们
Hoist that foresail for us, will you, boys?

838

主帆准备就绪
Main sail ready to haul!

839
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:17,366
好了 弗雷迪 现在升起主帆

840
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,733

轴承163.
Bearing 163.

843
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,700
拉森 修整主帆
Lassen, trim the main sail

844
00:55:31,733 --> 00:55:33,200
然后打结
and then tie it off!

845
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,600
你怎么能指望好呢
How do you expect good?

846
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,533
警告声
Report sounding.

849
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:17,466
这就是你要找的人么
So, this is your man that gets things done?

850
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:20,300
他的名字叫坎普比利  带 "K"
His name is Kamp Billy... with a K.

851
00:56:23,433 --> 00:56:25,066
他上的是英国寄宿学校
And he went to an English boarding school?

852
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,533
不是普通的寄宿学校 是伊顿公学
Not just any boarding school. He went to Eton,

853
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:32,333
寄宿学校
the boarding school.

854
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:34,833
对
Right...

855
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,833
他在这里做什么
Then what's he doing here?

856
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:41,800
他是个王子
He's a prince.

857
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:44,266
究竟是什么王子
A prince of what, exactly?

858
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:47,333
费尔南多波王子
The Prince of Fernando Po!

859
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:50,333
这么说 他既是海盗 又是贵族
So, he's part pirate, part aristocrat?

860
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,433
真别致
Chic.

861
00:56:53,433 --> 00:56:55,333
他也是我们解决方案的一部分
He's also a part of our solution.

866
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,366
看来你总是带着礼物来
Seems like you always come bearing gifts.

867
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:17,866
她适合我吗

868
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,366
祝你好运
Good luck with that.

869
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,500
我不适合你
I'm not for you,

870
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,066
但这些适合
but these are.

871
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,400
嗯 好东西 美味
Mmm. Goodies. Yummy.

872

874
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:37,833
有人很有品味
Someone has taste.

875
00:57:39,066 --> 00:57:42,166
比母鸡的牙齿还稀有
Rarer than hens' teeth.

876
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:45,266
RH 告诉我 KB
Well, RH tells me that KB

877
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,866
是唯一可以交谈的人
is the only man to talk to

878
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,066
在完成任务时
when it comes to getting things done.

879
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,300
为什么我觉得自己
Why do I feel like I've gone from being

880
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:53,566
从捕食者对猎物
the predator to the prey?

881
00:58:00,866 --> 00:58:02,933
年轻的女士 你的入场式真不错
Quite an entrance, young lady.

882
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:04,733
条件是我们要对它们进行抽样检查
It's on the condition that we sample them...

883
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,800
现在
now.

884
00:58:10,266 --> 00:58:11,500
阿德 摆好桌子
Ade, set the table.

885
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:12,766
好的 老大
Chief.

886
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,200
然后公爵说
And then the Duke said,

887
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,900
"推进去 直到它停下来 "
"Push it in till it stops!"

888
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:25,133
你真是个武器高手
You are quite the weapon.

889
00:58:25,933 --> 00:58:26,933
我想是的
I was right,

890
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,000
我是猎物
I was the prey.

891
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,733
我会帮你 因为我不喜欢纳粹
I'll help you because I don't like Nazis.

892
00:58:35,733 --> 00:58:38,766
不是因为他们是纳粹 而是因为他们很俗气
Not because they're Nazis but because they're gauche.

893
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:40,733
我再帮一把 给你12个最好的手下
I'll give you a tug and 12 of my best men,

894
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:42,300
包括你本人
including yours truly.

895
00:58:43,933 --> 00:58:46,800
但如果我要帮你 谁来帮我
But if I'm gonna help you, who's gonna help me?

896
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:48,733
因为你不是士兵 RH
Because you're not a soldier, RH.

897
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,266
不 但她是
No, but she is.

898
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,000
她会把你的人打得落花流水
She'll outshoot your best man.

899
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:35,166
我告诉过你
I told you.

900
00:59:38,733 --> 00:59:40,266
不  不 不
- No! - No!

901
00:59:42,533 --> 00:59:43,933

集合地点 费尔南多波外20公里处

与赫伦会合
The rendezvous with Heron.

909
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:07,833
你能带我们过去吗
Can you get us there?

910
01:00:07,866 --> 01:00:09,033
如果天气晴朗
If the weather holds,

911
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:11,266
我可以的 长官
I can, sir.

912
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,300
20英镑赌这不会有好结果
Twenty quid says this doesn't end well.

913
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:32,133
为了谁
For who?

914
01:00:32,766 --> 01:00:34,266
对他们来说
For them.

915
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:36,566
你不能拿自己当赌注 那是假球
You can't bet on yourself, Haysey. That's match-fixing.

916
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,600
开始吧
Let's do it.

917
01:00:40,866 --> 01:00:42,233
苍鹭 好久不见
Heron, it's been too long.

918

01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:49,633
这是坎普比利 费尔南多波王子
This is Kamp Billy, the Prince of Fernando Po.

921
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,900
殿下
Your Highness.

922
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,400
他同意帮助我们
He's agreed to help us.

923
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,066
请原谅我 但是
Forgive me, but...

924
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,900
我有一种奇怪的感觉 我们以前见过
I have a peculiar feeling that we've met before.

925
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,000
我经常遇到这种情况 我的旅行经历非常丰富
I get that a lot. I'm extremely well-traveled.

926
01:01:04,033 --> 01:01:07,133
不 不 这是一种特殊的感觉
No, no. It's a particular sense.

927
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:13,300
我想你没打过板球吧
I don't suppose you played cricket, did you?

928
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,166
伊顿公学上尉 21岁至22岁
Captained Eton. '21 to '22.

929
01:01:18,266 --> 01:01:20,466
我就知道 我认得你的脸
I knew I knew your face!

930
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,466
就在奖杯柜旁边
Right next to the trophy cabinet.

931
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,266
八英尺高的巨幅肖像
An eight-foot-tall huge portrait.

932
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:28,166
是的 正是如此
Yes, exactly that!

933
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,533
一只眼睛盯着边界
One eye on the boundary...

934
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:31,133
一只眼睛盯着酒馆
...one eye on the pub.

935
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:32,700
很高兴你能加入我们
Bloody glad to have you aboard.

936

很高兴来到这里 老伙计
Bloody good to be here, old boy.

937
01:01:35,033 --> 01:01:36,800
真无聊
I'm very bored

938
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,766
这些纳粹分子为非作歹
with these Nazis making a nuisance of themselves.

939
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,333
我是说 这对生意很不利
I mean, it's terrible for business.

940
01:01:40,433 --> 01:01:42,133
我非常高兴
I'm only too pleased

941
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:45,333
帮你能让他们吃点苦头
to help you serve them a bloody nose.

942
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:47,100
这种态度值得称赞
That's a commendable attitude.

943
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:48,900
那么 你有什么计划
So, what's your plan?

944
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
苹果
Apple.

945
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:52,466
我们要击沉公爵夫人号
We're going to sink the Duchessa,

946
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,133
加上两艘拖船
plus the two tugs.

947
01:01:54,266 --> 01:01:56,333
削弱希特勒的大西洋U艇舰队
Crippling Hitler's Atlantic fleet of U-boats.

948
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:57,866
非常好
Very good.

949
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:00,333
问题是 我们的老朋友纳粹
The thing is, our old friends the Nazis

950
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:01,800
并不简单
aren't making it the easiest.

951
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,066
我们的人数是二百比五
We're outnumbered two hundred to five.

952
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:06,033
士兵比我们预计的要多一些
There's a few more soldiers than we anticipated.

953
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:08,133
我认为要
I think that we're gonna have

954
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:10,200
再找几个魁梧的小伙子
to find ourselves a few more strapping lads.

955
01:02:11,033 --> 01:02:12,233
阿德
Ade...

956
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,666
对
Right...

957
01:02:27,666 --> 01:02:28,866
是的 我想这样就可以了
Yes, I think that will do.

958
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:32,766
我们带了一些武器 如果你需要的话
We brought some weapons if you need.

959
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:35,000
你们留着吧 我们自己带了
You hold onto those. We brought our own.

960
01:02:37,933 --> 01:02:40,266
给他们看看家伙
Oyah! Show them the iron!

961
01:02:43,233 --> 01:02:44,933
真牛逼
Marvelous.

962
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:46,433
你知道公爵夫人号
You do know the Duchessa is

963
01:02:46,566 --> 01:02:49,000
距离港口一侧是否超过200英尺
more than 200 feet from the harbor side?

964
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,433
而她就在灯光的照耀下
And she's in full glare of the lights.

965
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:53,366
不容易沉下去
She's not gonna be easy to sink

966
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,466
别引起不必要的注意
without attracting unwanted attention.

967
01:02:55,566 --> 01:02:58,800
是的 这就是为什么赫伦会安装炸弹的原因
Yes. That's why Heron will plant a bomb

968
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,166
在我们划船进港之前 先把灯吹灭
to blow the lights, before we paddle in

969
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,066
并在船体上安装炸药
and rig the hull with explosives.

970
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:06,433
到炸药引爆时
By the time the explosives detonate,

971
01:03:06,566 --> 01:03:07,766
我们早已离开
we'll be heading home.

972
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:09,900
如果按照我的方式 一枪都不用开
If I had it my way, a shot'll never be fired.

973
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:12,500
你又有多少次 按自己的方式行事
And how often do you have it your way?

974
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,466
那要看你问谁了 老伙计
Depends on who you ask, old boy.

975
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:18,000
先生们
Gentlemen...

976
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,266
老大
- Ade. - Chief.

977
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:21,333
让他们做好准备
Prepare the men.

978
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:23,400
你准备好了 我就拿走那20块 弗雷迪
I'll take that 20 whenever you're ready, Freddy.

979
01:03:42,266 --> 01:03:44,266
公爵夫人明天早上就会离开
The Duchessa will be gone by the morning.

980
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,533
你能做到吗
Can you manage that?

981
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:50,766
这是两根电线和滴答声
It's two wires and a tick-tock.

982
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,500
我肯定能应付
I'm sure I can cope.

983
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,166
你该担心的不是我
It's not me you should be worried about.

984
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:01,766
我从没带过纳粹去参加派对
I've never taken a Nazi to a party.

985
01:04:04,933 --> 01:04:07,566
只要别参加他的派对就行
Just don't end up at one of his parties.

986
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:12,766
别担心我
Don't worry about me.

987
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:15,866
我要开个自己的小派对
I'm gonna have my own little party.

988
01:04:21,266 --> 01:04:23,333
为伙计们干杯 为国王陛下的政府干杯
Drink for the boys, on His Majesty's government.

989
01:04:28,033 --> 01:04:30,966
通常 我会咬掉你的手
Ordinarily, I'd bite your hand off,

990
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:33,300
因为众所周知 我喜欢一磅纸币
as I have been known to love a pound note.

991
01:04:37,133 --> 01:04:38,433
但这次
But on this occasion,

992
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,800

这只是冰山一角

我们的任务将会失败

炸药不起作用

1067

因为船体加强加固

1083
01:13:50,266 --> 01:13:51,833

你现在所做的一切到此为止

01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,033
庞德上将
and Admiral Pound

1134
01:15:57,133 --> 01:15:58,933
已下令中止任务
has ordered the mission to be aborted.

1135
01:15:58,966 --> 01:16:01,500
他想让议会解除你的职务
He wants to have parliament remove you from office.

1136
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:04,133
任务必须继续
The mission must continue.

1137
01:16:04,133 --> 01:16:05,600
01 这里是基地 完毕
01, this is base. Over.

1138
01:16:05,633 --> 01:16:06,966
如果庞德有问题 告诉他
Tell Pound if he has a problem,

1139
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,133
他知道我在哪里
to take it up with me. He knows where I live.

1140
01:16:09,133 --> 01:16:10,833
告诉大家 继续前进
Tell the men to press on.

1141
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,166
恐怕我们失去了联系 长官
I'm afraid we've lost all communication, sir.

1142
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,300
我们一定能做些什么
There must be something that we can do.

1143
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:21,233
我唯一能做的就是提醒你
The only thing I can do is remind you,

1144
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,400
我们选择马奇 菲利普斯的原因
the reason we chose March-Phillips

1145
01:16:23,433 --> 01:16:25,766
是因为他不服从命令
is because he doesn't follow orders.

1146
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,300
希望我们的选择没错
Then let's hope we chose well.

1147
01:16:35,366 --> 01:16:38,066
公爵夫人号的船体已经加固
The Duchessa's hull has been reinforced.

1148
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:40,033
并不意味着不能击沉
Which means she can't be sunk.

1149
01:16:40,033 --> 01:16:43,333
至少以我们携带的炸药数量 确实如此
At least not with the amount of explosives we're carrying.

1150
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:45,700
我想知道到底发生了什么 什么情况
Just wondering how and when exactly this took place.

1151
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,566
无论如何 都不重要了 重要的是已经发生了
It's not important how and when, it's happened.

1152
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,700
这很重要
Well, it is kind of important, Gus.

1153
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,733
我不在乎坐牢
I don't care about the prison time,

1154
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:53,600
但我关心的是完成我们的任务
but I do care about finishing what we've started.

1155
01:16:53,633 --> 01:16:55,000
谢谢你 弗雷迪
Thank you, Freddy.

1156
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,166
一定是搞错了
There must be some sort of mistake.

1157
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,600
不可能只是加强
You can't just reinforce...

1158
01:16:57,633 --> 01:16:59,033
没有错 海斯
There's no mistake, Haysey.

1159
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:00,833
只是不知道具体的加固方式
I'm just lost about how and when exactly...

1160
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,066
够了
Enough!

1161
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,100
我们为什么不击沉拖船
Why don't we sink the tug boats?

1162
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:15,100
中断U型潜艇的补给
Get rid of the shuttle to the U-boats.

1163
01:17:16,366 --> 01:17:18,066
这还不够
It's not enough.

1164
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,433
他们会在一周内更换
They'll replace them in a week.

1165
01:17:29,366 --> 01:17:30,433
我们为什么不偷呢
Why don't we steal them?

1166
01:17:30,566 --> 01:17:31,833
我们可以用比利的船
We can use Billy's boat

1167
01:17:31,866 --> 01:17:33,566
将公爵夫人号拖出港口
to drag the Duchessa out of the harbor

1168
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,266
并偷走另外两艘德国拖船
and steal the other two German tug boats

1169
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,600
为U型潜艇提供服务
that service the U-boats.

1170
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:38,500
我们该怎么做呢
And how are we supposed to do that?

1171
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:42,100
她不仅是双层的 重量也是原来的两倍
Not only is she double-plated, weighing twice as much,

1172
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:43,900
但你需要船员 移动这么大的一艘船
but you'd need a full crew to move a ship that size.

1173
01:17:43,933 --> 01:17:45,666
拖船就是船员
The tug boats are the crew.

1174
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,300
我们把杜奇萨拖到海边
We tow the Duchessa out to the ocean

1175
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,666
而且 还能偷走很多东西
and, well, steal the lot.

1176
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,266
然后呢 我们还是不能击沉他们
Then what? We still can't sink them.

1177
01:17:54,433 --> 01:17:55,733
我们不需要
We don't need to.

1178
01:17:55,766 --> 01:17:57,333
我们驶入国际水域
We sail into international waters

1179
01:17:57,466 --> 01:17:58,933
并将一切移交给海军
and hand everything over to the Navy.

1180
01:17:58,933 --> 01:18:00,300
反正他们也在跟踪我们
They're following us anyway,

1181
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,466
所以他们会非常高兴见到我们
so they'll be more than happy to see us again.

1182
01:18:01,466 --> 01:18:03,000
那么锚呢
And what about the anchor?

1183
01:18:04,366 --> 01:18:05,533
你看到它的大小了吗
Have you seen the size of it?

1184
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,566
如果我们真的要移动它
If we're gonna actually start to move her,

1185
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,533
他们的S艇会在几秒钟内追上我们
their S-boats will catch us in seconds.

1186
01:18:09,633 --> 01:18:10,866
那么 你打算怎么做
Well, what are you going to do

1187
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,600
你带了那么多炸药 弗雷迪
with all the explosives you brought, Freddy?

1188
01:18:13,966 --> 01:18:15,900
我们用它们来炸锚
We'll use them to blow the anchor.

1189
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,200
我们会给S型艇装上设备 让他们跟不上
We'll rig the S-boats so they can't follow,

1190
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:20,400
钻机为U型潜艇提供燃料储备
rig the fuel reserve that supplies the U-boats,

1191
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:24,133
然后 好吧 炸掉这一切
and then, well, blow the lot up.

1192
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,833
燃料爆炸会
That fuel explosion's gonna bring

1193
01:18:25,933 --> 01:18:27,466
把每个人都炸到地下
everyone and their mother down to the harbor.

1194
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,100
我们设置了导火索
We set the fuse,

1195
01:18:29,133 --> 01:18:31,566
这样 一旦我们离开港口 卸油装置就会爆炸
so that the fuel dump blows once we're outside the harbor.

1196
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:34,066
然后我们悄悄溜出去
Then we sneak out quietly.

1197
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,700
不错
Not bad.

1198
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,966
这是耍小聪明
It's very greedy.

1199
01:18:41,866 --> 01:18:44,400
我加入好吧
- Well, I'm in. - Well,

1200
01:18:44,533 --> 01:18:47,766
我不会走的 除非我有一颗纳粹之心
I'm not leaving until I have a barrel full of Nazi hearts.

1201
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:49,866
你让我做什么 我就做什么 长官
I'll do whatever you tell me to do, sir.

1202
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:53,566
先生们
Gentlemen,

1203
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,200
我们去偷几艘船吧
let's steal some boats.

1204
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:12,700
结果发现是双层的 所以计划有变
Turns out she's double-plated, so change of plans.

1205
01:19:14,566 --> 01:19:16,200
我们要去偷船
We're going to steal the boats instead.

1206
01:19:19,433 --> 01:19:20,700
这可能吗
Is that even possible?

1207
01:19:22,566 --> 01:19:23,700
我不太确定
I'm not entirely sure.

1208
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:28,100
如果你愿意 我们也愿意
But if you're up for it, so are we.

1209
01:19:29,366 --> 01:19:30,500
你知道这意味着什么
And you know what that means.

1210
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:34,433
血流得更多 汗流得更多
A lot more blood and a lot more sweat.

1211
01:19:34,533 --> 01:19:36,100
希望不是我们的人 老伙计
Hopefully not any of ours, old boy.

1212
01:19:38,366 --> 01:19:40,300
我想没有你 我们是做不到的 比利
I don't think we can do this without you, Billy.

1213
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,166
好吧 如果你愿意 我也愿意
Well, I'm up for it if you are.

1214
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,733
我们需要你的拖船
I think we're gonna need your tug.

1215
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,800
海西和我将沿着海港散步
Haysey and I will take a stroll along the harbor

1216
01:20:00,933 --> 01:20:03,733
并消灭所有在巡逻的士兵
and take out any soldiers still patrolling.

1217
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:05,466
弗雷迪会把他的小艇开过来
Freddy will bring his dinghy around

1218
01:20:05,566 --> 01:20:06,766
并照顾好S艇
and take care of the S-boats.

1219
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,066
我们在拖船旁等你
We'll meet you by the tug boats.

1220
01:20:09,433 --> 01:20:10,733
公爵夫人呢
And the Duchessa?

1221
01:20:10,733 --> 01:20:12,300
这就是苹果和我
That's Apple and me.

1222
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,866
我们会照顾好所有船员并抛锚
We'll take care of any crew and blow the anchor.

1223
01:20:14,866 --> 01:20:16,166
摧毁他们的通讯设备
And destroy their comms.

1224
01:20:17,966 --> 01:20:20,233
不知道你会在船上遇到什么
Not sure what you'll meet on board.

1225
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:22,500
带上我的上司和另外两个手下
Take my top boy and two more of my men.

1226
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,433
先生们 开始准备吧
Gentlemen, let's prepare.

1227
01:20:34,766 --> 01:20:37,766
哦 鲨鱼 宝贝
Oh, the shark, babe

1228
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,000
凌厉的牙齿 亲爱的
Has such teeth, dear

1229
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,700
向他们展示了洁白的珍珠
And he shows them pearly white

1230
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:49,733
就像一把小刀
Just a jack-knife

1231
01:20:49,733 --> 01:20:52,466
亲爱的老麦克希斯
Has old MacHeath, dear

1232
01:20:53,633 --> 01:20:58,966
把它藏在看不见的地方
And he keeps it out of sight

1233
01:20:58,966 --> 01:21:01,866
你知道鲨鱼什么时候咬人吗
You know when that shark bites

1234
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,800
用他的锋利牙齿 亲爱的
With his teeth, dear

1235
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:12,466
猩红色的波浪开始蔓延
Scarlet billows starts to spread

1236
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:17,400
漂亮的服饰 穿着老麦克希斯的服饰 亲爱的
Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, dear

1237
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,333
所以从来没有一丝红色
So there's never, never a trace of red

1238
01:21:23,733 --> 01:21:27,000
在人行道上
On the sidewalk

1239
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,800
星期天早上 你还不知
On Sunday morning, don't you know

1240
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,800
好似说谎
Lies a body

1241
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:36,200
渗出的生命
Oozing life

1242
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:42,200
有人在拐角处鬼鬼祟祟地走来走去
And someone sneakin' around the corner

1243
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:48,200
那会是老麦克刀吗
Could that be old Mack the Knife?

1244
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,166
有一艘拖船
There's a tug boat

1245
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,533
在河边 你不知吗
Down by the river, don't cha know

1246
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,166
就好似在那一刻一泻千里
Where a cement bag's just a-drooping on down...

1247
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,066
还没有
Not yet.

1248
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,300
我的先生
Mein Herr.

1249
01:22:58,933 --> 01:23:00,133
海斯
Haysey...

1250
01:23:48,033 --> 01:23:49,133
在左边 长官
Up there on the left, sir.

1251
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:50,633
是的
Yes.

1252
01:23:53,866 --> 01:23:54,900
他发出了撞击声
He made a crash!

1253
01:24:09,966 --> 01:24:12,300
我们可以开那辆车 长官 给我们省点鞋皮
We could take that car, sir. Save us some shoe leather.

1254
01:24:47,033 --> 01:24:49,333
小心 老麦回来了
Look out, old Macky is back

1255
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,566
来了
Incoming.

1256
01:25:26,733 --> 01:25:29,066
请出示证件
Papers please.

1257
01:25:29,066 --> 01:25:30,833
指挥官 没事吧 弗雷迪
- Commander. - All good, Freddy?

1258
01:25:30,933 --> 01:25:32,200
准备就绪
Charges are set to go

1259
01:25:32,233 --> 01:25:33,533
一旦我们离开港口 长官
once we're out of the harbor, sir.

1260
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,400
那我们继续吧
Let's carry on then.

1261
01:25:51,733 --> 01:25:53,066
喜欢你的礼物吗
Did you enjoy your gift?

1262
01:25:53,933 --> 01:25:54,933
嗯
Mmm.

1263
01:25:57,266 --> 01:26:00,266
我想现在是时候了
I think now it's time

1264
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,100
狐狸向狐狸精展示自己的巢穴
that the fox shows his den to the vixen.

1265
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:41,000
苍鹭 为什么灯还亮着
Heron, why are the lights still on?

1266
01:26:42,366 --> 01:26:43,800
我用油灯点亮了房间
I lit the room with oil lamps,

1267
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:45,700
这样他们就不会注意到停电
so they wouldn't notice when the power went out.

1268
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,400
小心
Look out!

1269
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,700
弗莱迪 操纵这辆88
Freddy, rig this 88,

1270
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:50,233
然后和海斯一起拉第一下
then take the first tug with Haysey.

1271
01:27:54,033 --> 01:27:55,833
晚上好 晚上好
- Gute nacht. - Guten abend.

1272
01:28:00,966 --> 01:28:02,400
晚上好
Guten abend.

1273
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:29,666
非常抱歉 老伙计
Terribly sorry, old boy.

1274
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,600
你介意吗 我好像
Do you mind? I seem to...

1275
01:28:31,633 --> 01:28:33,533
我的刀插错地方了
...have misplaced my knife.

1276
01:29:37,933 --> 01:29:39,300
讨厌
Bugger!

1277
01:29:46,766 --> 01:29:47,766
谢谢你 比利
Thank you, Billy.

1278
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,266
哦
Oh!

1279
01:30:54,466 --> 01:30:56,100
我希望那不是你的血 拉森
I hope that's not your blood, Lassen.

1280
01:30:57,233 --> 01:30:58,866
我也希望如此
I hope so too.

1281
01:31:05,266 --> 01:31:06,833
好了 伙计们 出发吧
Okay, boys, cast off.

1282
01:31:06,866 --> 01:31:08,133
把船开走吧
Let's get this ship out of here.

1283
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,300
走吧 走吧
Go on. Go on...

1284
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:21,200
走
Go on!

1285
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,600
像这样的房间还有三个
There's three more rooms just like this one.

1286
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,100
应该能在接下来的六个月里阻止U型潜艇
That should stop the U-boats for the next six months.

1287
01:31:31,966 --> 01:31:33,366
把这东西拖走吧
Let's get this thing towed out of here.

1288
01:31:33,366 --> 01:31:34,966
我们在这里 伙计们
We are here, boys.

1289
01:31:35,066 --> 01:31:36,633
别出声设个警告
Quietly. Let's set a warning.

1290
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:43,966
我需要你到船头去
I need you to go to the front of the boat

1291
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,966
并将火神号连接到公爵夫人号上
and attach the Vulcan to the Duchessa,

1292
01:31:46,066 --> 01:31:47,266
拉森和我去桥上
Lassen and I will head to the bridge.

1293
01:31:47,266 --> 01:31:49,100
好的
Okay.

1294
01:31:50,733 --> 01:31:52,766
走右边
Take the right side.

1295
01:31:52,766 --> 01:31:54,666
而你 上台 开始吧
And you, get up there and get this thing started.

1296
01:32:06,966 --> 01:32:07,966
是格斯
It's Gus.

1297
01:32:09,533 --> 01:32:10,733
每个人都已就位
Everyone's in place.

1298
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,966
什么
What,

1299
01:32:14,966 --> 01:32:16,866
你不会真以为这样能行吧
you didn't actually think it would work, did you?

1300
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:18,966
这是你的计划
It was your plan.

1301
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
那么 让我们确保
Well, let's make sure

1302
01:32:21,133 --> 01:32:22,766
遵守的约定
we keep our end of the bargain.

1303
01:32:22,766 --> 01:32:24,400
发信号回来 我就离开
Signal back and I'll heave off.

1304
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,733
那么 现在该怎么办
So, what happens now?

1305
01:32:28,766 --> 01:32:30,400
我们等着锚链爆炸
We wait for the anchor chain to blow.

1306
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,233
预计什么时候呢
When do we expect that to happen?

1307
01:32:32,366 --> 01:32:34,300
我希望很快
Shortly, I hope.

1308
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:36,600
然后我们就可以击沉她
And then we're free to take her.

1309
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:41,066
然而 一旦燃料库消失 比赛就开始了
However, the real race begins once the fuel depot goes.

1310
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,400
到时候岛上所有的士兵都会出现
Then we'll have every soldier on the island turning up.

1311
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:47,766
我们可不想亲眼目睹这一切
We don't wanna be around to witness that.

1312
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:50,600
保险丝有多长
How long was that fuse

1313
01:32:50,633 --> 01:32:51,900
你的锚链是什么
you attached to the anchor chain?

1314
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,266
我们很快就会知道
We'll find out soon enough.

1315
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,300
等着吧 你会抓住绳子的
Wait for it, you're gonna catch the rope.

1316
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:09,666
来吧
Come on.

1317
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,933
第一张多米诺骨牌倒下
First domino falls.

1318
01:33:32,866 --> 01:33:34,333
接另一条线 是 老板
- Hitch up the other line. - Yes, boss.

1319
01:33:34,366 --> 01:33:35,366
挑起重担
Pick up the slack.

1320
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,933
他们必须在燃料库爆炸前转移
They need to move her before the fuel dump blows.

1321
01:33:41,433 --> 01:33:43,166
赫伦 我们需要马乔
Heron, we need Marjorie.

1322
01:33:43,166 --> 01:33:44,900
交给我吧
Leave Marjorie to me.

1323
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,133
我们会赶上你的
We'll catch you up.

1324
01:33:47,033 --> 01:33:48,033
非常好
Very good.

1325
01:33:48,766 --> 01:33:49,900
我们走吧
Let's go!

1326
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,933
我不得不说 小姐
I have to say, Fraulein,

1327
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,600
你很正点
you were good.

1328
01:34:41,066 --> 01:34:42,633
你很狡猾
And you were sly.

1329
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:45,533
只有两种人
There are only two types of people

1330
01:34:45,633 --> 01:34:47,600
像狐狸一样狡猾
that are as sly as the fox.

1331
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:49,800
德国人
The German

1332
01:34:51,133 --> 01:34:52,433
犹太人
and the Jew.

1333
01:34:55,533 --> 01:34:59,500
你也不是德国人
And you are not German.

1334
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,333
我想现在是时候
I think now it's time...

1335
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,333
开始真正的派对
...for a real party.

1336
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,166
这本不该发生
That wasn't supposed to happen yet.

1337
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:25,066
把她铐起来
Shackle her!

1338
01:35:25,966 --> 01:35:26,966
跟我来
And follow me.

1339
01:35:30,566 --> 01:35:32,166
港口受到攻击
The harbor is under attack!

1340
01:35:52,466 --> 01:35:53,466
他们来了
They're coming.

1341
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,900
我们需要引擎的动力
We need power on the engine.

1342
01:36:04,533 --> 01:36:06,733
太重了 把她扶起来
- She's too heavy! - Pick up the slack!

1343
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,366
等等
Wait...

1344
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:25,633
她不动了
She's not moving!

1345
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,266
开火 开火 开火
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1346
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,366
等着瞧吧
Wait for it.

1347
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,533
我们需要更强的引擎动力
We need more power on the engine.

1348
01:36:53,533 --> 01:36:55,666
给我更多的动力 更多的动力
Give me more power! More power!

1349
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,566
这就对了 它开始动了
That's it, it's working!

1350
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:00,733
就是这样
That's it!

1351
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:28,966
准备就绪
Ready!

1352
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,233
海斯
Haysey!

1353
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,666
我们现在离开射程了
We're out of range now.

1354
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,100
我不是专家
I'm no expert.

1355
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,633
但你肩膀上有个伤口 海斯
But you've got a big old hole in your shoulder, Haysey.

1356
01:39:47,766 --> 01:39:49,366
队长
Captain,

1357
01:39:49,366 --> 01:39:51,633
你能给我解释一下 怎么回事吗
would you explain to me what's going on here?

1358
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,866
动力消失了
The power is gone.

1359
01:39:54,966 --> 01:39:57,266
燃料库遭到破坏
The fuel depot has been sabotaged.

1360
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:58,533
没有人知道发生了什么
And no one knows what's happening.

1361
01:39:58,566 --> 01:39:59,633
但这是你的错
But this is your fault.

1362
01:39:59,766 --> 01:40:01,000
我的船在哪里
Where is my ship?

1363
01:40:02,933 --> 01:40:04,500
公爵夫人号 她去哪儿了
The Duchessa, where did it go?

1364
01:40:04,633 --> 01:40:06,800
有人趁你不注意 开走了
Someone's taken him while you weren't looking.

1365
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:09,233
你个白痴
You idiot!

1366
01:40:09,266 --> 01:40:10,800
你总得解释一下
You always have to say something

1367
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,600
在非常错误的时间
at the very wrong time.

1368
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:16,500
和你一起永远都是错的
There is never a right time with you!

1369
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,833
你的贪婪和变态
Your greed and perversion

1370
01:40:18,866 --> 01:40:20,900
让你分心了
has distracted you from your duties.

1371
01:40:20,933 --> 01:40:22,700
现在 我的海港被毁了
Now my harbor is destroyed.

1372
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:24,166
船也不见了
And my ship is gone!

1373
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,800
现在你也走吧 谢谢了
And now you're gone too. Thank you.

1374
01:40:59,033 --> 01:41:00,033
令人印象深刻
Impressive.

1375
01:41:03,133 --> 01:41:04,233
听起来你的雷管起作用了
Sounds like your detonators worked.

1376
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,600
干杯 小姐
Chapeau, mademoiselle.

1377
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:46,900
你弹得很好 真是个狐狸精
You play well. You really are the vixen.

1378
01:41:48,266 --> 01:41:49,266
是吗
Am I?

1379
01:41:51,066 --> 01:41:52,700
我都已经坦诚相待了
Well, my hand's been revealed.

1380
01:41:56,533 --> 01:41:58,733
现在怎么办
So, what now?

1381
01:41:58,866 --> 01:42:02,733
现在 我拥有了你
Now, I possess your hand

1382
01:42:02,866 --> 01:42:04,866
以及你对我所做的一切
and for everything you have done to me,

1383
01:42:06,366 --> 01:42:09,633
我将千倍奉还
I will visit a thousand fold upon you.

1384
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:17,900
是啊
Yeah.

1385
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,300
但是没用
But no.

1386
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,433
躺下
Lie down.

1387
01:42:45,233 --> 01:42:48,100
格斯 我们不能再等了
Gus, we can't wait much longer.

1388
01:42:51,733 --> 01:42:52,800
他们来了
They're coming.

1389
01:42:52,933 --> 01:42:54,433
如果我们留在这里
If we stay here,

1390
01:42:54,566 --> 01:42:56,600
会与其他人失去联系
we'll lose contact with the others.

1391
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,533
坚持住 比利
Hold fast, Billy.

1392
01:42:58,566 --> 01:43:01,200
苍鹭和玛乔丽都有自己的生存之道
Heron has a way of surviving and Marjorie,

1393
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,933
好吧 祝你好运
well... good luck with that.

1394
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,033
有一艘巡逻艇向我们驶来
That's a patrol boat coming towards us.

1395
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,266
格斯 我们必须离开 现在就走
Gus, we need to leave. Now.

1396
01:43:18,433 --> 01:43:19,566
等等
Hold on...

1397
01:43:31,966 --> 01:43:32,966
是他们
It's them.

1398
01:43:34,433 --> 01:43:35,833
RH.
RH.

1399
01:43:36,966 --> 01:43:39,133
KB.马乔里
- KB. - Marjorie.

1400
01:43:39,133 --> 01:43:41,400
真是穿得又多又少
Overdressed and underdressed at the same time.

1401
01:43:44,466 --> 01:43:46,200
来吧 让我们把你解救出来
Come on, let's get you out of those shackles.

1402

进来 维奥莱特

呼叫 "紫罗兰号"
Calling H.M.S. Violet.

1404
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,000
收到 维奥莱特
Come in, Violet.

1405
01:43:58,033 --> 01:43:59,366
这是伴娘
This is Maid Honor.

1406
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:00,366
说吧 伴娘
Go ahead, Maid Honor.

1407
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,333
开免提
Loudspeaker.

1408
01:44:03,366 --> 01:44:05,000
对不起 这么晚了还打扰您
Sorry to bother you at this time of the night,

1409
01:44:05,033 --> 01:44:06,633
但我们发现有一两个项目
but we've found ourselves with one or two items

1410
01:44:06,633 --> 01:44:07,900
您可能会感兴趣
that might be of interest to you.

1411

我不确定

高级军事人员

从未和海军指挥官一起
and Navy Commanders of this country

1457
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,766
他们的谴责如此一致
been so united in their condemnation.

1458
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:17,066
他们认为
It is their view

1459
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:18,800
认为该纪律
that the discipline

1460
01:47:18,833 --> 01:47:21,700
我们的武装部队赖以生存
on which our armed forces depends

1461
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:24,700
被不为服从之人所破坏
has been undermined by men serving no master

1462
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:27,700
而是他们对鲜血 谋杀和混乱的渴求
but their own thirst for blood, murder and mayhem.

1463
01:47:30,066 --> 01:47:31,500
不服从命令之人
Men who disobeyed a direct order

1464
01:47:31,533 --> 01:47:33,000
来自舰队司令本人
from the Admiral of the fleet himself,

1465
01:47:34,933 --> 01:47:35,933
而选择了
and chose instead

1466
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:38,366
相信心血来潮的直觉
to trust the whim and intuition

1467
01:47:39,833 --> 01:47:41,366
还有站在他身边的人

1468
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:44,400
他们怎么敢

1469
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,600
今天上午

第一批美国士兵抵达英国领土

1471
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:54,233
和我们并肩作战

1472
01:47:54,266 --> 01:47:55,266
和我们一起在欧洲
with us in Europe.

1473
01:47:57,033 --> 01:47:59,200
冒死横渡北大西洋的盟军
Allies who risked death crossing the North Atlantic,

1474
01:48:00,933 --> 01:48:02,600
只有奇迹出现

1475
01:48:04,566 --> 01:48:08,033
发现纳粹U型潜艇并没有给他们带来麻烦
found their crossing untroubled by Nazi U-boats.

1476
01:48:10,566 --> 01:48:12,433
我可以补充 这是一个令人高兴的情况
A happy circumstance, I might add,

1477
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:16,166
无法解释
which cannot be accounted for,

1478
01:48:16,266 --> 01:48:18,766
但却为美国扫清了道路
but which has cleared the way for the United States

1479
01:48:18,766 --> 01:48:20,766
参加欧洲战争
to enter the European war.

1480
01:48:20,766 --> 01:48:22,466
我知道
And for which I know

1481
01:48:22,566 --> 01:48:26,233
罗斯福总统将不胜感激
President Roosevelt to be immeasurably grateful.

1482
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,033
但是
But setting aside

1483
01:48:31,133 --> 01:48:34,366
撇开这一笔无法解释的财富
this stroke of unexplained fortune,

1484
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:37,500
如何处置这支桀骜不驯的队伍
what is to be done with this unruly company

1485
01:48:37,533 --> 01:48:39,100
谁不服从命令
who do not obey orders?

1486
01:48:39,133 --> 01:48:40,700
似乎已经无关紧要
Who seem to have formed

1487
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:44,600
属于他们的战争之师
their own ministry of ungentlemanly warfare.

1488
01:48:49,533 --> 01:48:51,166
现在开始 将被纳入麾下
From now on, they work for me.
