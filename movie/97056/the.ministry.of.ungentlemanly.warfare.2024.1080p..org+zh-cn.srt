00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,530
{\an8}Uh, Sweden.

3
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,530
{\an2}呃，瑞典。

4
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,990
{\an8}I'm... I'm... Swedish

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,990
{\an2}我是...我是...瑞典人

6
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,760
{\an8}but I speak a little English.

7
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,760
{\an2}但我会说一点英语。

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,830
{\an8}We're coming on board.

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,830
{\an2}我们要上船了。

10
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,110
{\an8}All are welcome.
All are welcome.

11
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,110
{\an2}欢迎大家。
欢迎大家。

12
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,280
{\an8}Even the little one.
He can come too.

13
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,280
{\an2}即使是小个子。
他也可以来。

14
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,750
{\an8}Welcome.

15
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,750
{\an2}欢迎。

16
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,090
{\an8}Why are you here?

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,090
{\an2}你为什么在这？

18
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,920
{\an8}Just a little sailing holiday.

19
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,920
{\an2}只是一个小小的航海假期。

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,350
{\an8}A jolly boys trip.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,350
{\an2}一次快乐的男孩之旅。

22
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,160
{\an8}Take your hands off.

23
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,160
{\an2}把你的手拿开。

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,170
{\an8}Papers?

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,170
{\an2}文件？

26
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,760
{\an8}Passport?

27
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,760
{\an2}护照？

28
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,130
{\an8}Here you go.

29
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,130
{\an2}干得好。

30
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,970
{\an8}Any other people on the boat?

31
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,970
{\an2}船上还有其他人吗？

32
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,140
{\an8}Just the two of us.

33
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,140
{\an2}只有我们俩。

34
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,610
{\an8\i1}Nein.{\i}

35
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,610
{\an2}不。

36
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,120
{\an8}Come, come,
we have lots to eat...

37
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,120
{\an2}怎么样怎么样，
我们有很多吃的...

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,050
{\an8}Take your dirty hands off me!

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,050
{\an2}把你的脏手拿开！

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,150
{\an8}Back off!

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,150
{\an2}退后！

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,490
{\an8}And you,

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,490
{\an2}你呢，

44
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,530
{\an8}put your hands in the air!

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,530
{\an2}把你的手举到空中！

46
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,810
{\an8}Ooh!

47
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,810
{\an2}哦！

48
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,240
{\an8}You're in trouble now!

49
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,240
{\an2}你现在有麻烦了！

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,170
{\an8}You've been a naughty boy!

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,170
{\an2}你本来就是个顽皮的孩子！

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,440
{\an8}I'll give you 100 francs
to shoot him.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,440
{\an2}我给你100法郎
射杀他。

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,510
{\an8}Don't shoot me!

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,510
{\an2}别开枪打我！

56
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,690
{\an8}He hates Germans.
You should really shoot him.

57
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,690
{\an2}他讨厌德国人。
你真的应该开枪打死他。

58
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,260
{\an8}I... I'm sorry.
You are very scary.

59
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,260
{\an2}我……对不起。
你很可怕。

60
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,700
{\an8}Make him walk the plank.

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,700
{\an2}让他走木板。

62
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,030
{\an8}He loves wood.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,030
{\an2}他喜欢木头。

64
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,370
{\an8}Dirty drunken animal!

65
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,370
{\an2}肮脏的喝醉的动物！

66
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,330
{\an8}Guilty as charged.

67
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,330
{\an2}被指控有罪。

68
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,850
{\an8}I always take
a can of kerosene

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,850
{\an2}我总是拿
一罐煤油

70
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,460
{\an8}for just
these sort of occasions.

71
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,460
{\an2}只是为了
这些场合。

72
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,530
{\an8}It's been a while,

73
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,530
{\an2}有一阵子了，

74
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,530
{\an8}but the last time
someone laughed at me

75
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,530
{\an2}但最后一次
有人嘲笑我

76
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,100
{\an8}when I boarded their vessel,

77
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,100
{\an2}当我登上他们的船时

78
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,970
{\an8}I gave them the choice.

79
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,970
{\an2}我给了他们选择。

80
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,860
{\an8}Either swim to shore

81
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,860
{\an2}要么游到岸边

82
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,530
{\an8}or take their chances
on a burning ship.

83
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,530
{\an2}或者抓住机会
在一艘燃烧的船上。

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,980
{\an8}Hans and I wondered
which option they'd choose,

85
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,980
{\an2}汉斯和我想知道
他们会选择哪个选项，

86
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,880
{\an8}death by water or death by fire.

87
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,880
{\an2}水死或火死。

88
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,450
{\an8}Oddly, they chose both.

89
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,450
{\an2}奇怪的是，他们都选择了。

90
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,230
{\an8}They waited
until the very last moment,

91
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,230
{\an2}他们等了
直到最后一刻，

92
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,730
{\an8}until their hair was on fire,

93
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,730
{\an2}直到头发着火，

94
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,930
{\an8}and their blistered skin
peeled from their fingers,

95
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,930
{\an2}和他们起泡的皮肤
从他们的手指上剥落，

96
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,530
{\an8}before they immersed
themselves in water

97
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,530
{\an2}在他们沉浸之前
自己在水中

98
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,940
{\an8}in the vain hope

99
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,940
{\an2}在徒劳的希望中

100
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,340
{\an8}of reaching shore.

101
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,340
{\an2}到达岸边。

102
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,840
{\an8}One of them

103
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,840
{\an2}其中之一

104
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,900
{\an8}sank immediately and perished.

105
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,900
{\an2}立即沉没并灭亡。

106
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,270
{\an8}But to our amazement,
the big one,

107
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,270
{\an2}但令我们惊讶的是，
大的那个，

108
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,680
{\an8}he showed great spirit.

109
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,680
{\an2}他表现出了伟大的精神。

110
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,750
{\an8\i1}In spite of all the odds...{\i}

111
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,750
{\an2}尽管困难重重...

112
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,190
{\an8\i1}...he painstakingly
made it to shore.{\i}

113
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,190
{\an2}……他煞费苦心

114
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,560
{\an8}We followed and cheered him on

115
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,560
{\an2}我们跟着他并为他加油

116
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,150
{\an8}and rewarded
this impressive achievement

117
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,150
{\an2}并得到奖励
这一令人印象深刻的成就

118
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,290
{\an8}with a bullet

119
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,290
{\an2}用子弹

120
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,470
{\an8}to the back of his head.

121
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,470
{\an2}到他的后脑勺。

122
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,300
{\an8}Isn't that funny?

123
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,300
{\an2}这不是很有趣吗？

124
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,670
{\an8}Why aren't you laughing?

125
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,670
{\an2}你为什么不笑？

126
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,590
{\an8}Nice work, Lassen.

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,590
{\an2}干得好，让我们吧。

128
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,760
{\an8}There's more
where that came from.

129
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,760
{\an2}还有更多
那是从哪里来的。

130
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,530
{\an8}Yes.

131
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,530
{\an2}是的。

132
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
{\an8}Ah...

133
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
{\an2}啊...

134
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,360
{\an8}Not sure it's working, Lassen.

135
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,360
{\an2}不确定它是否有效，拉森。

136
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,370
{\an8}The captain
looks rather agitated.

137
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,370
{\an2}船长
看起来比较激动。

138
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,640
{\an8}They're bringing their guns
to bear.

139
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,640
{\an2}他们带着枪
忍受忍受。

140
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,910
{\an8}They'll find their range
soon, sir.

141
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,910
{\an2}他们会找到自己的范围
很快，先生。

142
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,290
{\an8}Freddy, should we be worried?

143
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,290
{\an2}弗雷迪，我们应该担心吗？

144
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,960
{\an8}Oh, I don't think so, sir.

145
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,960
{\an2}哦，我不这么认为，先生。

146
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,690
{\an8}It's a rather large explosive,
so I set a rather large fuse.

147
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,690
{\an2}这是一个相当大的炸药
所以我设置了一个相当大的保险丝。

148
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,930
{\an8}I located the outside
of the powder room,

149
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,930
{\an2}我找到了外面
化妆间的，

150
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,070
{\an8}so when it goes bang,

151
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,070
{\an2}所以当它爆炸时

152
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,290
{\an8}it really should go bang.

153
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,290
{\an2}它真的应该爆炸。

154
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,630
{\an8}Closer...

155
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,630
{\an2}靠近一点...

156
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,970
{\an8}Should be any second now, chaps.

157
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,970
{\an2}现在应该是任何时候了，伙计们。

158
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,840
{\an8}Freddy?

159
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,840
{\an2}弗雷迪？

160
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,410
{\an8}Good work, Frederick.

161
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,410
{\an2}干得好，弗雷德里克。

162
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,750
{\an8}Thank you, Captain.

163
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,750
{\an2}谢谢你，船长。

164
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,880
{\an8}Now, any chance you can tell us

165
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,880
{\an2}现在，只要有机会你可以告诉我们

166
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
{\an8}what we're doing here, sir?

167
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
{\an2}我们在这里做什么，先生？

168
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,170
{\an8\i1}The war in Europe rages on{\i}

169
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,170
{\an2}欧洲战争愈演愈烈

170
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,600
{\an8\i1}as Hitler and his Nazi horde
sweep aside all in their path.{\i}

171
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,600
{\an2}正如希特勒和他的纳粹部落

172
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,270
{\an8\i1}Poland, Belgium and now France{\i}

173
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,270
{\an2}波兰、比利时，现在是法国

174
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,510
{\an8\i1}have all fallen
to Hitler's fascist regime,{\i}

175
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,510
{\an2}都已倒下

176
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,610
{\an8\i1}leaving Britain
holding up the final hopes{\i}

177
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,610
{\an2}离开英国

178
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,880
{\an8\i1}of liberation
for all of Europe.{\i}

179
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,880
{\an2}解放的

180
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,420
{\an8\i1}So, come on, Blighty,
get ready for a fighty.{\i}

181
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,420
{\an2}所以，来吧，布莱蒂，

182
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
{\an8\i1}But we cannot do it alone.{\i}

183
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
{\an2}但我们无法独自做到这一点。

184
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,520
{\an8\i1}And any hope
for our American brothers{\i}

185
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,520
{\an2}以及任何希望

186
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,450
{\an8\i1}to join us
from across the Atlantic{\i}

187
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,450
{\an2}加入我们

188
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,020
{\an8\i1}remains frustrated{\i}

189
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,020
{\an2}仍然感到沮丧

190
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,230
{\an8\i1}by Germany's secret weapon,
the U-boat.{\i}

191
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,230
{\an2}德国的秘密武器，

192
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,700
{\an8\i1}These deadly little submarines{\i}

193
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,700
{\an2}这些致命的小型潜艇

194
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,560
{\an8\i1}hunt at will
in the North Atlantic.{\i}

195
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,560
{\an2}随意狩猎

196
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,300
{\an8\i1}Undetectable, the U-boat
sinks ships indiscriminately,{\i}

197
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,300
{\an2}无法被发现的U型潜艇

198
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,070
{\an8\i1}whether carrying
munitions, provisions{\i}

199
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,070
{\an2}是否携带

200
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,710
{\an8\i1}or civilians heading{\i}

201
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,710
{\an2}或平民前往

202
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,910
{\an8\i1}from our companions
across the pond.{\i}

203
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,910
{\an2}来自我们的同伴

204
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,640
{\an8\i1}So long as the U-boats
rule the Atlantic,{\i}

205
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,640
{\an2}只要U型潜艇

206
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,110
{\an8\i1}it remains impossible{\i}

207
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,110
{\an2}这仍然是不可能的

208
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,980
{\an8\i1}for America's brave troops
to reach our shores.{\i}

209
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,980
{\an2}为了美国勇敢的军队

210
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,280
{\an8\i1}Will Britain be forced
to appease Hitler's plans{\i}

211
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,280
{\an2}英国会被迫吗

212
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,390
{\an8\i1}or face devastation
from his offensive?{\i}

213
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,390
{\an2}或面临毁灭

214
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,890
{\an8\i1}London burns
and her seas run red,{\i}

215
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,890
{\an2}伦敦燃烧

216
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,920
{\an8\i1}as bombs from above
and torpedoes from below{\i}

217
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,920
{\an2}就像来自上面的炸弹

218
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,490
{\an8\i1}grind the Brits down.{\i}

219
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,490
{\an2}把英国人压垮。

220
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,300
{\an8\i1}And with no defense
against these lethal U-boats,{\i}

221
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,300
{\an2}并且在毫无防御的情况下

222
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,470
{\an8\i1}it appears all hope may be lost{\i}

223
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,470
{\an2}看来所有的希望都破灭了

224
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,210
{\an8\i1}for peace in Europe.{\i}

225
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,210
{\an2}为了欧洲的和平。

226
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,500
{\an8}The Germans cut off
our supply chain with U-boats,

227
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,500
{\an2}德国人切断了
我们的潜艇供应链，

228
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,410
{\an8}we cut off the supply chain
to the U-boats.

229
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,410
{\an2}我们切断供应链
到U型潜艇。

230
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,210
{\an8}Through our intelligence agents,

231
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,210
{\an2}通过我们的情报人员，

232
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,650
{\an8}we've found a way.

233
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,650
{\an2}我们找到了办法。

234
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,590
{\an8\i1}The entire{\i}

235
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,590
{\an2}整个

236
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,920
{\an8\i1}servicing, repairing,
and rearming{\i}

237
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,920
{\an2}保养、维修、

238
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,800
{\an8\i1}of Hitler's
Atlantic U-boat fleet...{\i}

239
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,800
{\an2}希特勒的

240
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,630
{\an8\i1}is operated
by two Nazi tug boats...{\i}

241
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,630
{\an2}已操作

242
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,700
{\an8\i1}and an Italian supply ship
in Fernando Po.{\i}

243
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,700
{\an2}和一艘意大利补给舰

244
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,670
{\an8}I need men who are willing
to go and sink those ships.

245
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,670
{\an2}我需要愿意的男人
去击沉那些船。

246
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,870
{\an8}Why don't we just
air-raid Fernando Po

247
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,870
{\an2}我们为什么不直接
空袭费尔南多·波

248
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,040
{\an8}and sink the ships?

249
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,040
{\an2}并击沉船只？

250
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,310
{\an8}Because crafty Germans,
being crafty Germans,

251
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,310
{\an2}因为狡猾的德国人，
作为狡猾的德国人，

252
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,780
{\an8\i1}have positioned themselves
in a Spanish colony.{\i}

253
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,780
{\an2}已经给自己定位了

254
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,360
{\an8\i1}Fernando Po
is neutral territory.{\i}

255
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,360
{\an2}费尔南多·波

256
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,350
{\an8\i1}If we attack that colony,{\i}

257
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,350
{\an2}如果我们攻击那个殖民地

258
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,890
{\an8\i1}the rest of unoccupied Europe
will join the Nazis,{\i}

259
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,890
{\an2}欧洲其他无人占领的地区

260
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,160
{\an8\i1}and it's only
a question of time{\i}

261
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,160
{\an2}这只是

262
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,230
{\an8\i1}before we find ourselves{\i}

263
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,230
{\an2}在我们发现自己之前

264
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,690
{\an8\i1}frying big pink sausages{\i}

265
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,690
{\an2}煎大粉红香肠

266
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,800
{\an8}wearing nothing but lederhosen.

267
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,800
{\an2}只穿皮短裤。

268
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,770
{\an8}Hitler is not
playing by the rules

269
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,770
{\an2}希特勒不是
遵守游戏规则

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,560
{\an8}and neither are we.

271
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,560
{\an2}我们也不是。

272
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,310
{\an8}This will of course be
an unsanctioned,

273
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,310
{\an2}这当然会是
未经批准的、

274
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,980
{\an8}unauthorized
and unofficial mission.

275
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,980
{\an2}未经授权的
和非官方任务。

276
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,910
{\an8}If they're captured
by the British,

277
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,910
{\an2}如果他们被抓获
由英国人，

278
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,950
{\an8}they'll be thrown in jail.

279
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,950
{\an2}他们将被投入监狱。

280
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,980
{\an8}But if the Nazis find them...

281
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,980
{\an2}但如果纳粹找到他们...

282
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,050
{\an8}it's torture and death.

283
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,050
{\an2}这是酷刑和死亡。

284
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,980
{\an8\i1}Somewhat contentiously,{\i}

285
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,980
{\an2}有点争议，

286
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,860
{\an8\i1}I may have just the man,{\i}

287
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,860
{\an2}我可能只有这个男人，

288
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,690
{\an8\i1}but rather inconveniently,{\i}

289
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,690
{\an2}但比较不方便的是

290
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,260
{\an8\i1}he's currently incarcerated
at His Majesty's pleasure.{\i}

291
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,260
{\an2}他目前被监禁

292
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,590
{\an8\i1}We may not like his attitude,{\i}

293
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,590
{\an2}我们可能不喜欢他的态度，

294
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,600
{\an8}but he's bold, he's a killer,

295
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,600
{\an2}但他很大胆，他是个杀手

296
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,170
{\an8}and the men
will follow him anywhere.

297
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,170
{\an2}和男人们
会跟随他到任何地方。

298
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,470
{\an8}Are we sure this is a good idea?

299
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,470
{\an2}我们确定这是个好主意吗？

300
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
{\an8}Of course we're not.

301
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
{\an2}我们当然不是。

302
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,240
{\an8}But we're desperate.

303
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,240
{\an2}但我们很绝望。

304
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,220
{\an8}- Send him in.

305
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,220
{\an2}- 把他送进来。

306
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,690

458
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,350
{\an8}Hayes is a magnificent sailor
and I trust him.

459
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,350
{\an2}海耶斯是一位出色的水手
我相信他。

460
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,280
{\an8}If we're going
to try and sink a large ship,

461
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,280
{\an2}如果我们要去的话
试图击沉一艘大船

462
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,460
{\an8}we'll need
Freddy "The Buzz" frogman.

463
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,460
{\an2}我们需要
“嗡嗡声”弗雷迪蛙人。

464
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,490
{\an8\i1}He can swim across the channel
with his feet tied together.{\i}

465
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,490
{\an2}他可以游过海峡

466
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,290
{\an8\i1}Admittedly,{\i}

467
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,290
{\an2}不可否认，

468
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,030
{\an8\i1}he's a convicted arsonist
and a terrible misery{\i}

469
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,030
{\an2}他是一名被定罪的纵火犯

470
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,100
{\an8\i1}unless he's destroying something.{\i}

471
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,100
{\an2}除非他要毁掉什么东西。

472
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,500
{\an8}But he's very good
at blowing things up.

473
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,500
{\an2}但他很好
炸毁东西。

474
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,340
{\an8}Next, we'll need
the Danish hammer.

475
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,340
{\an2}接下来，我们需要
丹麦锤子。

476
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,510
{\an8}Anders Lassen.

477
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,510
{\an2}让它有所不同。

478
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,780
{\an8\i1}Grew up wrestling bears{\i}

479
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,780
{\an2}长大后的摔跤熊

480
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,510
{\an8\i1}and hunting elk
on his family estate.{\i}

481
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,510
{\an2}和狩猎麋鹿

482
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,780
{\an8\i1}He's a legend{\i}

483
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,780
{\an2}他是一个传奇

484
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,850
{\an8\i1}with a Bowie knife
and a bow and arrow.{\i}

485
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,850
{\an2}用鲍伊刀

486
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,180
{\an8\i1}He ran away at 18
to fight the Nazis{\i}

487
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,180
{\an2}18岁时他离家出走

488
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,680
{\an8\i1}after the Gestapo tortured
his brother to death.{\i}

489
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,680
{\an2}被盖世太保拷打后

490
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,750
{\an8\i1}He gave up filleting game
for gutting Nazis.{\i}

491
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,750
{\an2}他放弃了切片游戏

492
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,620
{\an8}He then turned up on our shores

493
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,620
{\an2}然后他出现在我们的海岸上

494
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,190
{\an8}ready to fight alongside us.

495
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,190
{\an2}准备好与我们并肩作战。

496
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,520
{\an8}He is an uncontrollable mad dog

497
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,520
{\an2}他是一只无法控制的疯狗

498
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,500
{\an8}who knows
a hundred creative ways

499
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,500
{\an2}谁知道
一百种创意方法

500
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,590
{\an8}to kill a man.

501
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,590
{\an2}去杀一个人。

502
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,400
{\an8}And finally,

503
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,400
{\an2}最后，

504
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,400
{\an8}and most importantly,
we'll need Geoffrey Appleyard.

505
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,400
{\an2}最重要的是，
我们需要杰弗里·阿普尔亚德。

506
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,410
{\an8}Yes, we thought you might.

507
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,410
{\an2}是的，我们认为你可能会。

508
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,310
{\an8}That's why we sent him

509
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,310
{\an2}这就是为什么我们派他来

510
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,740
{\an8\i1}on a reconnaissance mission
to Fernando Po.{\i}

511
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,740
{\an2}执行侦察任务

512
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,810
{\an8}Unfortunately,

513
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,810
{\an2}很遗憾，

514
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,350
{\an8}the Nazis nabbed him
on his return.

515
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,350
{\an2}纳粹抓住了他
在他回来时。

516
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,550
{\an8}All the more reason.
He knows what we need to know.

517
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,550
{\an2}更何况还有理由。
他知道我们需要知道什么。

518
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,990
{\an8}He's a master planner,

519
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,990
{\an2}他是一位总体规划师

520
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,620
{\an8}a master survivor,
a chess grand master

521
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,620
{\an2}一位幸存者大师，
国际象棋大师

522
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,090
{\an8}and a surgeon with the blade.

523
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,090
{\an2}和一个拿着刀片的外科医生。

524
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,760
{\an8\i1}We spent two weeks together
in a Dunkirk foxhole{\i}

525
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,760
{\an2}我们一起度过了两周

526
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,930
{\an8\i1}and if it wasn't for Apple,
I would still be there today.{\i}

527
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,930
{\an2}如果不是苹果的话

528
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,930
{\an8}No Apple, no mission.

529
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,930
{\an2}没有苹果，就没有使命。

530
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,170
{\an8}I'm afraid that's impossible.

531
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,170
{\an2}恐怕这是不可能的。

532
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,200
{\an8}Why?

533
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,200
{\an2}为什么？

534
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,340
{\an8\i1}Because he's being held{\i}

535
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,340
{\an2}因为他被关押着

536
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,010
{\an8\i1}by an entire German garrison
on La Palma.{\i}

537
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,010
{\an2}由整个德国驻军

538
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,480
{\an8}La Palma's on the way.

539
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,480
{\an2}拉帕尔马正在路上。

540
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,850
{\an8}- That's insanity.
- You let me worry about that.

541
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,850
{\an2}- 这太疯狂了。
- 你让我担心这个。

542
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,850
{\an8}I must get me
one of those coats.

543
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,850
{\an2}我必须得到我
其中一件外套。

544
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,820
{\an8}Now, any chance you can tell us

545
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,820
{\an2}现在，只要有机会你可以告诉我们

546
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,120
{\an8}what we're doing here, sir?

547
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,120
{\an2}我们在这里做什么，先生？

548
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,290
{\an8}Dry yourself off, frogman,
and I'll tell you.

549
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,290
{\an2}擦干身子吧，蛙人，
我会告诉你。

550
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,360
{\an8}The curiosity is
eating us all up, sir.

551
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,360
{\an2}好奇心是
把我们都吃掉了，先生。

552
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,660
{\an8\i1}I apologize
for all the secrecy, chaps.{\i}

553
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,660
{\an2}我道歉

554
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,170
{\an8}But this is

555
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,170
{\an2}但这是

556
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,530
{\an8}an unsanctioned, unofficial
and unauthorized mission.

557
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,530
{\an2}未经批准的、非官方的
和未经授权的任务。

558
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,300
{\an8}If we're picked up by the Brits,

559
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,300
{\an2}如果我们被英国人抓住

560
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,180
{\an8}we will all go to jail.

561
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,180
{\an2}我们都会进监狱。

562
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,880
{\an8}If we're picked up
by the Germans,

563
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,880
{\an2}如果我们被接走
由德国人，

564
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,010
{\an8}torture and death.

565
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,010
{\an2}酷刑和死亡。

566
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,340
{\an8}So, it's just
the four of us then?

567
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,340
{\an2}所以，这只是
那么我们四个人呢？

568
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,710
{\an8}And Captain Appleyard.

569
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,710
{\an2}还有阿普尔亚德船长。

570
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,650
{\an8}He's responsible
for securing this information.

571
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,650
{\an2}他有责任
为了保护这些信息。

572
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,930
{\an8}He is, however,
in a spot of bother.

573
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,930
{\an2}然而他却是
在一个麻烦的地方。

574
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,770
{\an8}He is being held
by the Germans on La Palma.

575
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,770
{\an2}他被关押
德国人在拉帕尔马岛上。

576
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,300
{\an8}Our first job
is to liberate him.

577
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,300
{\an2}我们的第一份工作
就是要解放他。

578
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,940
{\an8}- Oh, so, that's all, is it?
-No.

579
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,940
{\an2}- 哦，所以，就这些了，是吗？
-不。

580
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,000
{\an8}We need to confirm
Appleyard's intelligence.

581
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,000
{\an2}我们需要确认
阿普尔亚德的智慧。

582
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,730
{\an8}That's why
there are two more agents

583
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,730
{\an2}这就是为什么
还有两个代理

584
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,300
{\an8}on their way to Fernando Po
by train, as we speak.

585
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,300
{\an2}前往费尔南多波的路上
正如我们所说，乘火车。

586
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,100
{\an8}Doing what, exactly?

587
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,100
{\an2}到底在做什么？

588
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,240
{\an8}They'll be ensuring

589
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,240
{\an2}他们将确保

590
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,380
{\an8}that those ships
are filled with supplies,

591
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,380
{\an2}那些船
都装满了物资，

592
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,450
{\an8}so they're worth blowing up
in the first place.

593
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,450
{\an2}所以它们值得炸毁
首先。

594
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,390
{\an8}It's one thing
taking over the world,

595
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,390
{\an2}这是一回事
接管世界，

596
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,050
{\an8}but do they have to
take over the kitchen too?

597
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,050
{\an2}但他们必须这样做吗
也接管厨房？

598
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,960
{\an8}It's all sausage,
cabbage and black bread.

599
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,960
{\an2}都是香肠啊
卷心菜和黑面包。

600
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,790
{\an8}Who would
you have preferred?

601
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,790
{\an2}谁会
你有首选吗？

602
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,630
{\an8}The French offer
the refined classical take.

603
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,630
{\an2}法国报价
精致的古典风格。

{\an8}We won't survive much longer.

761
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,980
{\an2}我们活不了多久了。

762
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,290
{\an8}You have to make
the only decision you can make

763
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,290
{\an2}你必须做
你能做出的唯一决定

764
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,020
{\an8\i1}in good conscience,
Prime Minister.{\i}

765
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,020
{\an2}凭着良心，

766
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,430
{\an8\i1}Good God, girls.
Listen to yourselves.{\i}

767
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,430
{\an2}天啊，女孩们。

768
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,930
{\an8\i1}It's not appeasement,
it's surrender.{\i}

769
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,930
{\an2}这不是绥靖政策

770
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,430
{\an8}You still fail to realize
who we're up against.

771
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,430
{\an2}你还是没有意识到
我们的对手是谁。

772
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,140
{\an8}With respect, Prime Minister,
it's you who doesn't realize.

773
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,140
{\an2}尊敬的总理，
是你没有意识到。

774
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,540
{\an8}We cannot hope to defeat him.

775
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,540
{\an2}我们不能指望打败他。

776
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,370
{\an8}Hitler is
the mainspring of evil,

777
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,370
{\an2}希特勒是
罪恶的主要源泉，

778
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,450
{\an8}a guttersnipe.

779
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,450
{\an2}阴沟鸟。

780
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,450
{\an8}This is not a man
that we can negotiate with.

781
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,450
{\an2}这不是一个男人
我们可以与之谈判。

782
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,380
{\an8}I've read his book,
Admiral Pound.

783
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,380
{\an2}我读过他的书
庞德海军上将。

784
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,350
{\an8}The man is a vicious,
victimized ideologue.

785
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,350
{\an2}男人是个恶毒的人，
受害的意识形态。

786
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,480
{\an8}He cannot be trusted.

787
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,480
{\an2}他不值得信任。

788
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,190
{\an8}If I thought that
we could've achieved peace

789
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,190
{\an2}如果我这么想的话
我们本可以实现和平

790
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,320
{\an8}through surrendering,

791
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,320
{\an2}通过投降，

792
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
{\an8}I'd have done it already.

793
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
{\an2}我早就这么做了。

794
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,660
{\an8\i1}We need to stop our country
from starving.{\i}

795
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,660
{\an2}我们需要阻止我们的国家

796
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,930
{\an8\i1}We need
three million tons of supplies{\i}

797
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,930
{\an2}我们需要

798
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,460
{\an8}to cross the Atlantic
every month.

799
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,460
{\an2}横渡大西洋
每个月。

800
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,830
{\an8}We are currently losing
50% of that to U-boat attacks.

801
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,830
{\an2}我们目前正在失去
其中 50% 是 U 艇攻击。

802
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,570
{\an8}Another reason to take the deal.

803
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,570
{\an2}接受这笔交易的另一个原因。

804
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,810
{\an8}I've not finished,
Algernon, darling.

805
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,810
{\an2}我还没说完，
阿尔吉侬，亲爱的。

806
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,070
{\an8\i1}We need the Americans,{\i}

807
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,070
{\an2}我们需要美国人，

808
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,840
{\an8\i1}and they will
never enter the war{\i}

809
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,840
{\an2}他们会

810
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,810
{\an8\i1}if we already appear
to be a losing side.{\i}

811
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,810
{\an2}如果我们已经出现

812
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,350
{\an8}Ending hostilities with Germany

813
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,350
{\an2}结束与德国的敌对行动

814
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,420
{\an8}is the best path
out of this mess.

815
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,420
{\an2}是最好的路径
摆脱这个混乱。

816
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,380
{\an8}We are all in agreement,
Prime Minister.

817
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,380
{\an2}我们都一致同意，
总理。

818
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,520
{\an8}Thank you, gentlemen.

819
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,520
{\an2}谢谢你们，先生们。

820
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,200
{\an8}Yes,
thank you, gentlemen!

821
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,200
{\an2}是的，
谢谢你们，先生们！

822
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,240
{\an8\i1}M, Fleming,
this better be good news.{\i}

823
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,240
{\an2}M，弗莱明，

824
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,340
{\an8\i1}Prime Minister,{\i}

825
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,340
{\an2}总理，

826
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,210
{\an8\i1}we have the manifest here, sir.{\i}

827
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,210
{\an2}先生，我们这里有清单。

828
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,770
{\an8\i1}It's been confirmed{\i}

829
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,770
{\an2}已经确认了

830
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,510
{\an8\i1}the{\i} Duchessa
{\i1}is fully laden with supplies{\i}

831
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,510
{\an2}公爵夫人
物资满载

832
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,880
{\an8}to keep the U-boats
operational indefinitely.

833
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,880
{\an2}保留U型潜艇
无限期运行。

834
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,610
{\an8}If we're going to sink her,
now is the time.

835
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,610
{\an2}如果我们要把她沉没
现在是时候了。

836
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,020
{\an8}They're on their way.

837
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,020
{\an2}他们正在路上。

838
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,550
{\an8}And their chances?

839
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,550
{\an2}他们的机会呢？

840
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,550
{\an8}Well, if anyone can, they can.

841
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,550
{\an2}好吧，如果有人可以，他们就可以。

842
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,830
{\an8}But if we're discovered,

843
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,830
{\an2}但如果我们被发现了

844
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,800
{\an8}parliament will remove you
from office.

845
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,800
{\an2}议会将罢免你
从办公室。

846
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,930
{\an8}Well,

847
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,930
{\an2}出色地，

848
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,800
{\an8}we'd better make sure
we're not discovered then.

849
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,800
{\an2}我们最好确保
那时我们就没有被发现。

850
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,380
{\an8}We'll take it
from the cliffside.

851
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,380
{\an2}我们会接受它
从悬崖边。

852
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,710
{\an8}It's an 85-foot sheer climb.

853
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,710
{\an2}这是 85 英尺的陡坡。

854
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,840
{\an8}No one should notice

855
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,840
{\an2}没有人应该注意到

856
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,010
{\an8}a small, innocuous
fishing vessel.

857
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,010
{\an2}一个小的、无害的
渔船。

858
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,450
{\an8}We'll set up in the woods
and see what we're up against,

859
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,450
{\an2}我们将在树林里安营扎寨
看看我们面临着什么，

860
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,550
{\an8}then we'll go for a night raid.

861
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,550
{\an2}然后我们就去夜袭。

862
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,250
{\an8}Slip in quietly,
find Apple, come out fast.

863
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,250
{\an2}悄悄溜进去，
找到苹果，快点出来。

864
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,120
{\an8}Numbers?

865
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,120
{\an2}数字？

866
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,580
{\an8}Intelligence suggests
a garrison of 50 to 60.

867
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,580
{\an2}情报表明
驻军50至60人。

868
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,860
{\an8}That should be about 15 each.

869
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,860
{\an2}每个应该是15个左右。

870
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,430
{\an8}Lassen, try not to be greedy.
You do have a reputation.

871
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,430
{\an2}拉森，尽量不要贪心。
你确实有名气。

872
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,900
{\an8}My killing days are over.

873
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,900
{\an2}我杀戮的日子结束了。

874
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,140
{\an8}I'm just here
as a peacekeeping observer.

875
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,140
{\an2}我就在这里
作为维和观察员。

876
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,900
{\an8}Freddy, bag the kit,
silence the weapons.

877
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,900
{\an2}弗雷迪，把工具包装进袋子里，
让武器安静下来。

878
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,910
{\an8}When do we go?

879
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,910
{\an2}我们什么时候去？

880
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,760
{\an8}0200.

881
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,760
{\an2}0200.

882
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,480
{\an8}Take the towers first,
then move onto the radio room,

883
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,480
{\an2}先拿塔楼，
然后进入广播室，

884
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,650
{\an8}barracks and end up
in the control room...

885
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,650
{\an2}军营并结束
在控制室...

886
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,460
{\an8}- What do we have here?

887
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,460
{\an2}- 我们有什么在这里？

888
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,460
{\an8}Gestapo.

889
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,460
{\an2}盖世太保。

890
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,200
{\an8}How'd you know?

891
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,200
{\an2}你怎么知道的？

892
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,200
{\an8}The badder they are,
the better they're dressed.

893
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,200
{\an2}他们越坏，
他们穿得越好。

894
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,370
{\an8}I really must get me
one of those coats.

895
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,370
{\an2}我真的必须得到我
其中一件外套。

896
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,980
{\an8}They must be here for Apple.

897
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,980
{\an2}他们肯定是为了苹果而来。

898
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,180
{\an8}It's either torture
or, uh, extraction, sir.

899
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,180
{\an2}要么就是折磨
或者，呃，提取，先生。

900
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,480
{\an8}If they extract him,
it'll be the end of Apple.

901
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,480
{\an2}如果他们把他救出来
这将是苹果的终结。

902
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,680
{\an8}We won't be seeing him again.

903
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,680
{\an2}我们不会再见到他了。

904
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,980
{\an8}I'm afraid, gentlemen,

905
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,980
{\an2}恐怕先生们，

906
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,650
{\an8}we're not going
to have the luxury of night.

907
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,650
{\an2}我们不会去
享受奢华的夜晚。

908
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,980
{\an8}We're going
to have to go in now.

909
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,980
{\an2}本来打算
现在必须进去。

910
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,200
{\an8}So,
what's happened there then?

911
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,200
{\an2}所以，
那儿发生了什么事？

912
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,530
{\an8}It looks like

913
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,530
{\an2}看起来像

914
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,600
{\an8}they've been plugged
full of arrows, Haysey.

915
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,600
{\an2}他们已经被堵住了
充满了箭，海西。

916
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,700
{\an8}Well, where did the arrows go?

917
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,700
{\an2}那么，箭头去哪儿了呢？

918
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,780
{\an8}Straight through them.

919
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,780
{\an2}直接穿过他们。

920
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,220
{\an8}There were
two more round the other side.

921
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,220
{\an2}有
另一边还有两个。

922
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,420
{\an8}Where are they now?

923
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,420
{\an2}他们现在在哪里？

924
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,350
{\an8}Same place as these two.

925
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,350
{\an2}和这两个是同一个地方。

926
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,820
{\an8}Nazi heaven.

927
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,820
{\an2}纳粹天堂。

928
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,450
{\an8}Well, we've got
less than seven minutes

929
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,450
{\an2}嗯，我们有
不到七分钟

930
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,790
{\an8}before they're missed.

931
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,790
{\an2}在他们被错过之前。

932
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,020
{\an8}Alarms, dogs. None of it good.

933
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,020
{\an2}警报，狗。没有一个是好的。

934
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,730
{\an8}Go undercover of the engine.

935
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,730
{\an2}深入了解发动机。

936
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,560
{\an8}Only break cover
when things go bang.

937
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,560
{\an2}只能打破盖子
当事情发生的时候。

938
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,570
{\an8}I have a great idea, Lassen.

939
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,570
{\an2}我有一个好主意，拉森。

940
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,230
{\an8}Why don't you march off
by yourself

941
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,230
{\an2}你为何不出发
自己

942
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,800
{\an8}and fill those Germans
full of arrows?

943
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,800
{\an2}并填补那些德国人
充满了箭头？

944
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,580
{\an8}Freddy, grab the scissors
and help him with that fence.

945
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,580
{\an2}弗莱迪，拿起剪刀
并帮助他修好栅栏。

946
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,650
{\an8}Aye, sir.

947
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,650
{\an2}嘿，先生。

948
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,570
{\an8}Haysey, you're with me.
We go left.

949
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,570
{\an2}海西，你和我在一起。
我们向左走。

950
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,400
{\an8}Freddy, Lassen, you go right.

951
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,400
{\an2}弗雷迪、拉森，你们往右走。

952
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,110
{\an8}Fill your boots, gentlemen,
and bon appetit.

953
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,110
{\an2}先生们，装满你的靴子，
祝你胃口好。

954
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,750
{\an8}- See you at the tower.

955
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,750
{\an2}- 塔楼见。

956
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,450
{\an8}And remember, gentlemen,
try to have fun.

957
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,450
{\an2}请记住，先生们，
尝试玩得开心。

958
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,990
{\an8}-  So far, so good.

959
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,990
{\an2}- 到目前为止，一切都很好。

960
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,690
{\an8}- Doing rather well, Haysey.

961
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,690
{\an2}- 做得相当好，海西。

962
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,890
{\an8}Oh, why thank you, sir.

963
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,890
{\an2}噢，为什么要谢谢你，先生。

964
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,980
{\an8}It's very good.

965
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,980
{\an2}这很好。

966
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,020
{\an8}Sounds like
stealth mode's over.

967
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,020
{\an2}听上去像
隐身模式结束了

968
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,090
{\an8}Haysey, down!

969
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,090
{\an2}嘿，下来！

970
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,260
{\an8\i1}- Nein! Nein!{\i}

971
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,260
{\an2}- 不！不！

972
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,850
{\an8}Do we know each other?

973
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,850
{\an2}我们彼此认识吗？

974
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,560
{\an8}- No.

975
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,560
{\an2}- 不。

976
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,310
{\an8}Is that a heart, Lassen?

977
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,310
{\an2}那是一颗心吗，拉森？

978
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,810
{\an8}For the avoidance of doubt.

979
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,810
{\an2}为避免疑义。

980
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,120
{\an8}Apple, old boy.

981
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,120
{\an2}苹果，老男孩。

982
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,650
{\an8}- Gus.
-I see you two have met.

983
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,650
{\an2}- 格斯。
-我看你们两个已经见过面了。

984
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,350
{\an8}This is Haysey.

985
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,350
{\an2}这是海西。

986
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,920
{\an8}-Pleasure, Haysey.
- Pleasure's mine.

987
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,920
{\an2}-很高兴，海西。
- 快乐是我的。

988
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,230
{\an8}I thought you might need these.

989
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,230
{\an2}我想你可能需要这些。

990
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,090
{\an8}Jolly thoughtful of you.

991
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,090
{\an2}真高兴为你着想。

992
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,020
{\an8}You all find him?

993
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,020
{\an2}你们都找到他了吗？

994
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,860
{\an8}Oh, goody.

995
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,860
{\an2}哦，好极了。

996
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,100
{\an8}Bloody hell,
what happened to your nipples?

997
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,100
{\an2}该死的地狱，
你的乳头怎么了？

998
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,870
{\an8}You all right?

999
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,870
{\an2}你没事吧？

1000
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,280
{\an8}Couldn't unplug me, could you?
Battery's still on.

1001
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,280
{\an2}无法拔掉我的电源，可以吗？
电池还开着。

1002
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,950
{\an8}Did you see the {\i1}Duchessa,{\i}

1003
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,950
{\an2}你看到公爵夫人了吗？

1004
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,750
{\an8}the tug boats?

1005
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,750
{\an2}拖船？

1006
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,020
{\an8}And rather
a lot of Nazi soldiers.

1007
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,020
{\an2}相反
很多纳粹士兵。

1008
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,970
{\an8}Why wasn't that in your report?

1009
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,970
{\an2}为什么你的报告中没有这一点？

1010
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,030
{\an8}Because those soldiers
and those guns,

1011
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,030
{\an2}因为那些士兵
还有那些枪，

1012
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,700
{\an8}and those S-Boats are all new.

1013
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,700
{\an2}那些 S-Boats 都是新的。

1014
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,640
{\an8}That's a lot more
than the boys are expecting.

1015
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,640
{\an2}还有很多
比男孩们期待的还要多。

1016
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,810
{\an8}A month ago,
it was a dozen mechanics.

1017
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,810
{\an2}一个月前，
有十几个机械师。

1018
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,940
{\an8}Six drunk sailors.

1019
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,940
{\an2}六个醉酒的水手。

1020
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,280
{\an8}Two fat Spaniards.

1021
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,280
{\an2}两个胖西班牙人。

1022
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,980
{\an8}And a Nazi in a pear tree.

1023
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,980
{\an2}还有梨树上的纳粹。

1024
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,450
{\an8}I'd say,
we're gonna need more help.

1025
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,450
{\an2}我会说，
我们需要更多帮助。

1026
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,060
{\an8}You leave that to me.

1027
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,060
{\an2}你把这个留给我吧。

1028
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,420
{\an8}- Of course.

1029
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,420
{\an2}- 当然。

1030
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,860
{\an8}-But right now...

1031
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,860
{\an2}-但是现在...

1032
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,030
{\an8}- ...you need to meet that man.

1033
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,030
{\an2}- ...你需要见见那个人。

1034
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,470
{\an8}Your man.
The reason you're here.

1035
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,470
{\an2}你的男人。
你来这里的原因。

1036
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,300
{\an8}Ah.

1037
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,300
{\an2}啊。

1038
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,380
{\an8}The only thing
worse than a Nazi...

1039
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,380
{\an2}唯一的事情
比纳粹还坏……

1040
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,740
{\an8}is him.

1041
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,740
{\an2}是他。

1042
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,440
{\an8}I'm very disappointed, Heron.

1043
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,440
{\an2}我很失望，赫伦。

1044
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,740
{\an8}There are 16 crates
in my warehouse

1045
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,740
{\an2}有16个箱子
在我的仓库里

1046
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,340
{\an8}you have not yet
shipped to the mainland.

1047
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,340
{\an2}你还没有
运往大陆。

1048
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,480
{\an8}No need to fret, {\i1}Herr{\i} Luhr.

1049
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,480
{\an2}不用担心，鲁尔先生。

1050
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
{\an8}They'll still be delivered
by the agreed date.

1051
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
{\an2}他们仍然会被交付
在约定的日期之前。

1052
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,120
{\an8}That may be.

1053
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,120
{\an2}那可能。

1054
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,450
{\an8}But they take up valuable space.

1055
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,450
{\an2}但它们占用了宝贵的空间。

1056
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,520
{\an8}For this, I expect

1057
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,520
{\an2}为此，我期望

1058
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,690
{\an8}a significant reduction
in your fee.

1059
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,690
{\an2}显着减少
在你的费用中。

1060
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,890
{\an8}-I can do 5%...

1061
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,890
{\an2}-我可以做到5%...

1062
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,530
{\an8}...as a gesture of goodwill.

1063
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,530
{\an2}……作为一种善意的姿态。

1064
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,060
{\an8}Twenty. And don't waste
my precious time haggling.

1065
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,060
{\an2}二十。并且不要浪费
我讨价还价的宝贵时间。

1066
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,130
{\an8}Well,
strictly speaking,

1067
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,130
{\an2}出色地，
严格来讲，

1068
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,600
{\an8}there should be no reductions,

1069
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,600
{\an2}不应有任何减少，

1070
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,540
{\an8}since there's not yet been
any breach of contract.

1071
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,540
{\an2}因为还没有
任何违反合同的行为。

1072
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,230
{\an8}Five is more than polite,
20 rings like a sour note,

1073
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,230
{\an2}五不止于礼貌，
20响就像一个酸味的音符，

1074
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,040
{\an8}it jars.

1075
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,040
{\an2}它很吵。

1076
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,540
{\an8}It jars?

1077
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,540
{\an2}它罐子吗？

1078
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,250
{\an8}Am I being
accused of disharmony?

1079
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,250
{\an2}我是不是
被指责不和谐？

1080
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,450
{\an8}I take that
as a personal affront.

1081
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,450
{\an2}我认为
作为个人侮辱。

1082
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,080
{\an8}And I am supposing
you are not the secretary.

1083
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,080
{\an2}我假设
你不是秘书。

1084
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,160
{\an8}Miss Stewart is the contact
I said I'd arrange.

1085
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,160
{\an2}斯图尔特小姐是联系人
我说我会安排。

1086
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,630
{\an8}Ah, your New York gold contact?

1087
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,630
{\an2}啊，你的纽约黄金联系人吗？

1088
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,960
{\an8}I told you,

1089
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,960
{\an2}我告诉你了，

1090
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,260
{\an8}I already have
a satisfying arrangement.

1091
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,260
{\an2}我已经有了
令人满意的安排。

1092
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,060
{\an8}Have a seat.

1093
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,060
{\an2}请坐。

1094
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,330
{\an8}Thank you.

1095
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,330
{\an2}谢谢。

1096
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,270
{\an8}Well,
I hope I don't disappoint.

1097
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,270
{\an2}出色地，
我希望我不会失望。

1098
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,510
{\an8}I can't make a decision
on this presentation.

1099
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,510
{\an2}我无法做出决定
在本次演讲中。

1100
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,550
{\an8}Early days.

1101
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,550
{\an2}早些年。

1102
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,580
{\an8}Well, if early days
do come too soon,

1103
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,580
{\an2}好吧，如果早点
来得太早了，

1104
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,520
{\an8}and seasons change
with a Hunter's Moon.

1105
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,520
{\an2}和季节的变化
与猎人的月亮。

1106
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,330
{\an8}Hmm.

1107
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,330
{\an2}唔。

1108
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,030
{\an8}Hmm.

1109
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,030
{\an2}唔。

1110
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,930
{\an8}I have to say, Heron,

1111
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,930
{\an2}我不得不说，海伦，

1112
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,630
{\an8}for all your flaws,

1113
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,630
{\an2}对于你所有的缺点，

1114
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,700
{\an8}you do have a habit
of pulling rabbits from hats.

1115
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,700
{\an2}你确实有一个习惯
从帽子里拉兔子。

1116
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,310
{\an8}So, how much gold
do you wish to move,

1117
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,310
{\an2}那么，需要多少黄金
你想搬家吗

1118
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,350
{\an8}- Miss Stewart?

1119
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,350
{\an2}- 斯图尔特小姐？

1120
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,880
{\an8}As much as you can find.

1121
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,880
{\an2}能找到多少就找多少。

1122
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,390
{\an8}As I mentioned before,

1123
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,390
{\an2}正如我之前提到的，

1124
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,390
{\an8}I do already have
a very profitable arrangement.

1125
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,390
{\an2}我已经有了
一个非常有利可图的安排。

1126
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,960
{\an8}And despite of your commentary,

1127
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,960
{\an2}尽管有你的评论，

1128
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,400
{\an8}I pride myself
on maintaining harmony.

1129
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,400
{\an2}我为自己感到骄傲
关于维护和谐。

1130
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,370
{\an8}Now, why should I entertain you?

1131
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,370
{\an2}现在，我为什么要招待你？

1132
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,600
{\an8}Because you'll make more money
and have lots of fun

1133
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,600
{\an2}因为你会赚更多的钱
并有很多乐趣

1134
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,580
{\an8}whilst doing so.

1135
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,580
{\an2}这样做的同时。

1136
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,810
{\an8}If I'm not good for my word,
don't pay me.

1137
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,810
{\an2}如果我不遵守诺言，
别付钱给我。

1138
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,830
{\an8}Bravo.

1139
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,830
{\an2}太棒了。

1140
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,260
{\an8}I will talk to my people
and then we'll rendezvous.

1141
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,260
{\an2}我会和我的人民交谈
然后我们会合。

1142
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,070
{\an8}Lovely.

1143
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,070
{\an2}迷人的。

1144
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,280
{\an8}When the sly red cat
barks at dawn,

1145
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,280
{\an2}当狡猾的红猫
黎明时吠叫，

1146
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
{\an8}and kills just for her pleasure,

1147
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
{\an2}并为了自己的快乐而杀人，

1148
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,210
{\an8}who shares the meal
the cat did steal

1149
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,210
{\an2}谁分享这顿饭
猫确实偷了

1150
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,580
{\an8}when both looked on in pleasure?

1151
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,580
{\an2}当两人都高兴地看着的时候？

1152
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,420
{\an8\i1}Auf wiedersehen.{\i}

1153
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,420
{\an2}再见。

1154
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,300
{\an8}The riddle was a nice touch.

1155
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,300
{\an2}这个谜语是一个很好的接触。

1156
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,270
{\an8}The hook's in.

1157
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,270
{\an2}钩子进来了

1158
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,140
{\an8}Now be careful
how you reel him in.

1159
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,140
{\an2}现在要小心
你如何把他卷入。

1160
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,720
{\an8}I'll make sure
the harbor's empty

1161
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,720
{\an2}我会确定
港口空了

1162
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,920
{\an8}when the boys arrive.

1163
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,920
{\an2}当男孩们到达时。

1164
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,360
{\an8}How are you going to do that?

1165
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,360
{\an2}你打算怎么做？

1166
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,360
{\an8}I'll throw a party at my club.

1167
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,360
{\an2}我会在我的俱乐部举办一个聚会。

1168
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,000
{\an8}A costume party for the officers

1169
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,000
{\an2}为军官举办的化装舞会

1170
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,970
{\an8}and a second party at the dock
for the soldiers.

1171
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,970
{\an2}和码头的第二次聚会
对于士兵来说。

1172
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,770
{\an8}People like my parties.

1173
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,770
{\an2}人们喜欢我的聚会。

1174
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,140
{\an8}Everyone but Luhr.

1175
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,140
{\an2}除了卢尔之外的所有人。

1176
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,710
{\an8}That will be your job.

1177
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,710
{\an2}那将是你的工作。

1178
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,510
{\an8}All the rats
will follow the piper.

1179
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,510
{\an2}所有的老鼠
将跟随风笛手。

1180
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,390
{\an8}So,
if I understand correctly,

1181
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,390
{\an2}所以，
如果我理解正确的话

1182
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,980
{\an8}we're currently
here in La Palma.

1183
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,980
{\an2}我们目前
在拉帕尔马岛这里。

1184
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,930
{\an8}We'll sail around
German-controlled Africa

1185
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,930
{\an2}我们将四处航行
德国控制的非洲

1186
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:50,990
{\an8}to Fernando Po,

1187
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:50,990
{\an2}费尔南多·波，

1188
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,720
{\an8}which is just
north of the Equator,

1189
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,720
{\an2}这只是
赤道以北，

1190
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,490
{\an8}just off the West African coast.

1191
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,490
{\an2}就在西非海岸附近。

1192
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,630
{\an8}So that's the shortest route?

1193
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,630
{\an2}那么这是最短路线吗？

1194
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,200
{\an8}Yes, but we don't
want to go shorter.

1195
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,200
{\an2}是的，但我们不
想要更短。

1196
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,200
{\an8}Our priority is not to be seen.

1197
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,200
{\an2}我们的首要任务是不被人看到。

1198
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,770
{\an8}You mean, be seen again.

1199
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,770
{\an2}你的意思是，再次见到。

1200
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,970
{\an8}Again? Getting a little sloppy
on us now, Gussy?

1201
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,970
{\an2}再次？变得有点马虎
现在就轮到我们了，Gussy？

1202
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,340
{\an8}Had a run-in already?

1203
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,340
{\an2}已经有磨合了吗？

1204
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,070
{\an8}Never mind us, Apple, old boy.

1205
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,070
{\an2}别管我们，苹果，老男孩。

1206
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,470
{\an8}Remind me again

1207
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,470
{\an2}再次提醒我

1208
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,950
{\an8}how you found your nipples
attached to a car battery.

1209
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,950
{\an2}你是怎么找到你的乳头的
连接到汽车电池。

1210
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,950
{\an8}Yes. Wasn't my fault.

1211
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,950
{\an2}是的。不是我的错。

1212
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,650
{\an8}Bad intelligence.
Plus it was almost worth it

1213
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,650
{\an2}智力不好。
而且这几乎是值得的

1214
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,050
{\an8}to watch
the heart-snatcher at work.

1215
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,050
{\an2}观看
工作中的夺心者。

1216
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,050
{\an8}I'm better known as a lover
than a fighter.

1217
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,050
{\an2}我更出名的是一个情人
比战士。

1218
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,410
{\an8}Jesus Christ!

1219
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,410
{\an2}耶稣基督！

1220
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,990
{\an8}If that's how you fight,
I'd hate to see you love.

1221
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,990
{\an2}如果这就是你战斗的方式
我不愿意看到你爱。

1222
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,350
{\an8}You don't have
to worry about that,

1223
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,350
{\an2}你没有
担心这个，

1224
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,660
{\an8}you're too pretty for me.

1225
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,660
{\an2}你对我来说太漂亮了。

1226
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,520
{\an8}Freddy, on the other hand...

1227
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,520
{\an2}另一方面，弗雷迪...

1228
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,530
{\an8}You'd have to catch me first.

1229
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,530
{\an2}你得先抓住我。

1230
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,570
{\an8}I do love to hunt.

1231
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,570
{\an2}我确实喜欢打猎。

1232
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,040
{\an8}You'd be lucky.

1233
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,040
{\an2}你会很幸运。

1234
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,500
{\an8}I'm really getting quite hot.

1235
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,500
{\an2}我真的变得很热了。

1236
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,340
{\an8}Anyway, my suggestion is
that we take this wider route.

1237
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,340
{\an2}无论如何，我的建议是
我们采取这条更广泛的路线。

1238
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,810
{\an8\i1}It's obviously longer{\i}

1239
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,810
{\an2}明显更长了

1240
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,880
{\an8\i1}but it should avoid
any awkward conversations{\i}

1241
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,880
{\an2}但应该避免

1242
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,610
{\an8\i1}with German U-boats
or British warships.{\i}

1243
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,610
{\an2}与德国U艇

1244
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,780
{\an8\i1}Weather-dependent,{\i}

1245
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,780
{\an2}取决于天气，

1246
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,540
{\an8\i1}we should make it there
in 15 days.{\i}

1247
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,540
{\an2}我们应该到达那里

1248
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,820
{\an8}Agreed.

1249
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,820
{\an2}同意。

1250
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,550
{\an8}Haysey, do you think
you could manage that?

1251
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,550
{\an2}海西，你认为
你能做到吗？

1252
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,620
{\an8}Leave it to me, sir.

1253
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,620
{\an2}交给我吧，先生。

1254
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,210
{\an8}Just do as you're told

1255
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,210
{\an2}照你说的去做

1256
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,710
{\an8}- and get me another drink!

1257
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,710
{\an2}- 再给我一杯饮料！

1258
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,910
{\an8}Captain, sir.

1259
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,910
{\an2}船长，先生。

1260
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,320
{\an8}Can I get you something to eat?

1261
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,320
{\an2}我可以给你弄点吃的吗？

1262
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,690
{\an8}May I... Come this way.

1263
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,690
{\an2}我可以……这边过来吗？

1264
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,820
{\an8}- Take your hands off me.

1265
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,820
{\an2}- 把你的手拿开。

1266
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,590
{\an8}You know,

1267
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,590
{\an2}你知道，

1268
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,000
{\an8}I like you, Femi.

1269
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,000
{\an2}我喜欢你，费米。

1270
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,000
{\an8}But you touch me again
and you're going to jail.

1271
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,000
{\an2}但你又触碰了我
你会进监狱的。

1272
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,070
{\an8}Femi.

1273
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,070
{\an2}费米。

1274
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,440
{\an8}I'll deal with him.

1275
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,440
{\an2}我来对付他。

1276
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,600
{\an8}Please take care
of Miss Stewart.

1277
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,600
{\an2}请保重
斯图尔特小姐的。

1278
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,480
{\an8}You know what you need,
Captain Binea?

1279
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,480
{\an2}你知道自己需要什么，
比内亚队长？

1280
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,610
{\an8}I know what I need.

1281
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,610
{\an2}我知道我需要什么。

1282
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,280
{\an8}But do you, Ricardo?

1283
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,280
{\an2}但你呢，里卡多？

1284
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,320
{\an8}You need another drink.

1285
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,320
{\an2}你需要再喝一杯。

1286
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,130
{\an8}Marty,

1287
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,130
{\an2}马蒂，

1288
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,690
{\an8}good stuff.

1289
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,690
{\an2}好东西。

1290
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:12,090
{\an8}Ricardo, that's why I love you.

1291
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:12,090
{\an2}里卡多，这就是我爱你的原因。

1292
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,490
{\an8}- You understand.

1293
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,490
{\an2}- 你明白。

1294
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,630
{\an8}This is Fernando Po.

1295
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,630
{\an2}这是费尔南多·波。

1296
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,940
{\an8}Everybody's welcome.

1297
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,940
{\an2}欢迎大家。

1298
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,270
{\an8\i1}Si...{\i} Everybody.

1299
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,270
{\an2}斯...大家。

1300
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,140
{\an8}Too many body I think.

1301
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,140
{\an2}我认为太多的身体。

1302
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,150
{\an8}Armando?

1303
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,150
{\an2}阿曼多？

1304
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,650
{\an8}Have you fallen out
with our new friends?

1305
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,650
{\an2}你摔倒了吗
和我们的新朋友？

1306
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,480
{\an8}It's not fair, Ricardo.

1307
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,480
{\an2}这不公平，里卡多。

1308
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,650
{\an8}This is my harbor.

1309
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,650
{\an2}这是我的港湾。

1310
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,330
{\an8}I am in charge.

1311
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,330
{\an2}我是负责人。

1312
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,920
{\an8}Are they stepping on your toes?

1313
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,920
{\an2}他们踩到你的脚趾了吗？

1314
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,090
{\an8}They don't step, they stamp!

1315
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,090
{\an2}他们不是踩踏，而是跺脚！

1316
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,100
{\an8}They tell Captain Binea nothing.

1317
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,100
{\an2}他们什么也没告诉比尼亚船长。

1318
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,070
{\an8}Only now do I hear

1319
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,070
{\an2}直到现在我才听到

1320
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,570
{\an8}the {\i1}Duchessa{\i}
is leaving the harbor early.

1321
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,570
{\an2}公爵夫人
提前离开港口。

1322
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,300
{\an8}Well, good riddance.

1323
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,300
{\an2}好吧，摆脱了。

1324
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,080
{\an8}The harbor will be yours again.

1325
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,080
{\an2}港口将再次属于你。

1326
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,670
{\an8}When will you be free
of that ugly vessel?

1327
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,670
{\an2}你什么时候有空
那个丑陋的容器？

1328
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,680
{\an8}Three days earlier.

1329
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,680
{\an2}三天前。

1330
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,680
{\an8}Then we should
have another drink.

1331
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,680
{\an2}那么我们应该
再喝一杯。

1332
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,990
{\an8}To celebrate. Marty...

1333
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,990
{\an2}庆祝一下。马蒂...

1334
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,930
{\an8}Another round
for our Harbor Master.

1335
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,930
{\an2}再来一轮
为我们的港务长。

1336
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,160
{\an8}So, Captain, do you know
where they wish to relocate?

1337
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,160
{\an2}那么，船长，你知道吗？
他们希望搬迁到哪里？

1338
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,530
{\an8}It's neither cat nor dog
that kills for fun,

1339
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,530
{\an2}这既不是猫也不是狗
以杀人为乐，

1340
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,700
{\an8}it's the vixen, not another.

1341
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,700
{\an2}这是泼妇，不是另一个。

1342
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,240
{\an8}There's only two
that kill for fun,

1343
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,240
{\an2}只有两个
以杀人为乐，

1344
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,540
{\an8}my pretty friend,

1345
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,540
{\an2}我漂亮的朋友，

1346
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,610
{\an8}the fox and his human brother.

1347
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,610
{\an2}狐狸和他的人类兄弟。

1348
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,720
{\an8}I believe I have
resolved your little riddle.

1349
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,720
{\an2}我相信我有
解决了你的小谜语。

1350
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:56,200
{\an8\i1}Chapeau.{\i} You play well.

1351
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:56,200
{\an2}起首。你打得很好。

1352
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,910
{\an8}Speaking of foxes,

1353
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,910
{\an2}说起狐狸，

1354
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,740
{\an8}Horowitz and Meyer,
West 47th Street.

1355
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,740
{\an2}霍洛维茨和迈耶，
西47街。

1356
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:07,580
{\an8}Have you heard of them?

1357
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:07,580
{\an2}你听说过他们吗？

1358
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,920
{\an8}I don't believe I have, no.

1359
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,920
{\an2}我不相信我有，没有。

1360
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,520
{\an8}They're the largest gold traders

1361
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,520
{\an2}他们是最大的黄金交易商

1362
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,420
{\an8}in Midtown New York

1363
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,420
{\an2}位于纽约市中心

1364
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,780
{\an8}and you haven't heard of them?

1365
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,780
{\an2}你还没有听说过他们吗？

1366
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,650
{\an8}I'm afraid I haven't, no.

1367
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,650
{\an2}恐怕我没有，没有。

1368
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,320
{\an8}I am familiar, of course,
with Horowitz and Haim.

1369
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,320
{\an2}我当然很熟悉，
与霍洛维茨和海姆。

1370
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,660
{\an8}But they're in the west side
of the city.

1371
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,660
{\an2}但他们在西边
城市的。

1372
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,630
{\an8}But then again,

1373
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,630
{\an2}但话又说回来，

1374
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,370
{\an8}I'm sure you already
knew that, didn't you?

1375
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,370
{\an2}我确定你已经
你知道这一点，不是吗？

1376
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,800
{\an8}I'm curious,

1377
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,800
{\an2}我很好奇，

1378
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,380
{\an8}how do you find
dealing with the Jew?

1379
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,380
{\an2}你怎么找到
与犹太人打交道？

1380
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,680
{\an8}Oh, dear.

1381
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,680
{\an2}哦亲爱的。

1382
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:19,880
{\an8}I've slipped from one snare

1383
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:19,880
{\an2}我从一个网罗中滑落

1384
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,620
{\an8}only to find myself in another.

1385
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,620
{\an2}却发现自己在另一个人身上。

1386
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,490
{\an8}How shall I put this?

1387
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,490
{\an2}我该怎么说呢？

1388
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,800
{\an8}I fear your brilliant leader

1389
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,800
{\an2}我害怕你杰出的领袖

1390
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,870
{\an8}has mischaracterized
the ancient tribe of Jahuda.

1391
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,870
{\an2}已被错误描述
古老的贾胡达部落。

1392
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,060
{\an8}Their ability to not only

1393
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,060
{\an2}他们的能力不仅

1394
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,730
{\an8}survive 3,000 years
with a boot on their neck,

1395
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,730
{\an2}生存3000年
脖子上套着靴子，

1396
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:37,140
{\an8}but to prosper in spite of it...

1397
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:37,140
{\an2}但尽管如此，还是要繁荣......

1398
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,830
{\an8}I suspect it inspired
satanic jealousy within him.

1399
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,830
{\an2}我怀疑它的启发
他内心充满了撒旦的嫉妒。

1400
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,080
{\an8}In conclusion,

1401
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,080
{\an2}综上所述，

1402
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,480
{\an8}it looks as though

1403
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,480
{\an2}看起来好像

1404
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,050
{\an8}the lady doth protest too much.

1405
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,050
{\an2}这位女士抗议得太多了。

1406
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,750
{\an8}Is there a cherry to go
on this blasphemous cake,

1407
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,750
{\an2}有樱桃可去吗
在这亵渎的蛋糕上，

1408
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,130
{\an8}or have you finished?

1409
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,130
{\an2}或者你完成了吗？

1410
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:03,190
{\an8}I must confess,

1411
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:03,190
{\an2}我必须承认，

1412
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,730
{\an8}not only do I respect
and admire the Jew...

1413
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,730
{\an2}我不仅尊重
并钦佩犹太人......

1414
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,700
{\an8}I am one.

1415
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,700
{\an2}我孤身一人。

1416
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,090
{\an8}Kidding!

1417
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,090
{\an2}开玩笑！

1418
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,890
{\an8}They're greedy rats.

1419
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,890
{\an2}他们是贪吃的老鼠。

1420
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,030
{\an8}I think this could be

1421
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,030
{\an2}我认为这可能是

1422
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,940
{\an8}the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

1423
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,940
{\an2}开始
一段美好的友谊。

1424
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,230
{\an8}Then I shall throw a party
to celebrate.

1425
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,230
{\an2}然后我会举办一个聚会
庆祝。

1426
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,210
{\an8}I don't care for parties.

1427
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,210
{\an2}我不喜欢聚会。

1428
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,750
{\an8}Oh, spoilsport!
Everybody loves a party.

1429
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,750
{\an2}哦，糟蹋了！
每个人都喜欢聚会。

1430
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,210
{\an8}The {\i1}Duchessa's{\i} leaving

1431
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,210
{\an2}公爵夫人要离开

1432
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,480
{\an8}three days earlier
than we thought.

1433
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,480
{\an2}三天前
比我们想象的。

1434
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,580
{\an8}If we don't tell
the {\i1}Maid Honor,{\i}

1435
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,580
{\an2}如果我们不告诉
女仆荣誉，

1436
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:00,910
{\an8}they'll arrive too late.

1437
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:00,910
{\an2}他们会来得太晚了。

1438
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,830
{\an8}Incoming.

1439
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,830
{\an2}传入。

1440
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,240
{\an8}Contact.

1441
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,240
{\an2}接触。

1442
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,930
{\an8}More Jerries
on the island than expected.

1443
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,930
{\an2}更多杰瑞 (Jerry) 的商品
岛上的情况比预想的要好。

1444
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,770
{\an8}Tin of corned beef's
out of pantry

1445
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,770
{\an2}罐头咸牛肉
从食品储藏室出来

1446
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,610
{\an8}three days early.

1447
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,610
{\an2}提前三天。

1448
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,020
{\an8}I'll take that.

1449
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,020
{\an2}我会接受的。

1450
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,120
{\an8}It's confidential,
sir. For M only.

1451
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,120
{\an2}这是机密，
先生。仅适用于 M。

1452
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,790
{\an8}When it comes
to make the extraction,

1453
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,790
{\an2}当谈到
进行提取，

1454
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:34,850
{\an8}it needs to be a very...

1455
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:34,850
{\an2}它需要是一个非常...

1456
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:35,950
{\an8}Sir. Message, sir.

1457
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:35,950
{\an2}先生。留言，先生。

1458
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:43,200
{\an8}More Jerries
on the island than expected.

1459
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:43,200
{\an2}更多杰瑞 (Jerry) 的商品
岛上的情况比预想的要好。

1460
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,830
{\an8}Corned beef's out of the pantry

1461
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,830
{\an2}咸牛肉已经从食品储藏室里拿出来了

1462
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:47,960
{\an8}three days early.

1463
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:47,960
{\an2}提前三天。

1464
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,060
{\an8}Move faster.

1465
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,060
{\an2}动作快点。

1466
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,440
{\an8}Yes, but there's increased
U-boat sightings in the area.

1467
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,440
{\an2}是的，但是增加了
该地区的潜艇目击事件。

1468
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,970
{\an8}Sir.

1469
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,970
{\an2}先生。

1470
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,180
{\an8}The mission's
still proceeding.

1471
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,180
{\an2}使命的
仍在进行中。

1472
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,720
{\an8}So, there's more
soldiers on the island

1473
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,720
{\an2}所以，还有更多
岛上的士兵

1474
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,820
{\an8}and the boat's leaving earlier?

1475
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,820
{\an2}船要提前出发吗？

1476
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,160
{\an8}Yes.

1477
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,160
{\an2}是的。

1478
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,630
{\an8}Well, how are
we meant to move faster?

1479
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,630
{\an2}嗯，怎么样
我们的意思是要走得更快吗？

1480
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,830
{\an8}We can't move faster.

1481
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,830
{\an2}我们不能走得更快。

1482
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,620
{\an8}We're going as fast as we can.

1483
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,620
{\an2}我们会尽可能快地前进。

1484
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,660
{\an8}This is a fishing boat,
it's not a speedboat.

1485
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,660
{\an2}这是一艘渔船，
这不是快艇。

1486
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,890
{\an8\i1}Prime Minister,{\i}

1487
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,890
{\an2}总理，

1488
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,770
{\an8\i1}the{\i} Duchessa's {\i1}leaving
Fernando Po in 12 days.{\i}

1489
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,770
{\an2}公爵夫人离开

1490
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,400
{\an8\i1}On our current schedule,{\i}

1491
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,400
{\an2}按照我们目前的日程安排，

1492
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,000
{\an8\i1}they'll arrive
three days too late.{\i}

1493
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,000
{\an2}他们会到达

1494
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,540
{\an8}Can it still be done?

1495
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,540
{\an2}还可以做吗？

1496
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,270
{\an8\i1}We're still
awaiting a response{\i}

1497
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,270
{\an2}仍然

1498
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,080
{\an8\i1}from Major Phillips.{\i}

1499
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,080
{\an2}来自菲利普斯少校。

1500
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,250
{\an8}If we can't move faster,
we'll go shorter.

1501
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,250
{\an2}如果我们不能走得更快
我们会走得更短。

1502
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,280
{\an8}We can get to Fernando Po
in 12 days.

1503
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,280
{\an2}我们可以去找费尔南多·波
12天内。

1504
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,480
{\an8}Hold on, you said
we couldn't go shorter.

1505
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,480
{\an2}坚持住，你说
我们不能再短了。

1506
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,290
{\an8}No, I said
we don't want to go shorter.

1507
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,290
{\an2}不，我说
我们不想走得更短。

1508
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,090
{\an8}He said we'll get
mowed down by a U-boat.

1509
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,090
{\an2}他说我们会得到
被U型潜艇击落。

1510
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,460
{\an8}Or worse,
picked up by the Brits.

1511
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,460
{\an2}或者更糟糕的是，
被英国人捡到了。

1512
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,360
{\an8}Their armada of destroyers
are crossing there.

1513
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,360
{\an2}他们的驱逐舰舰队
正在穿越那里。

1514
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,920
{\an8}We will literally
be sailing over U-boats.

1515
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,920
{\an2}我们将从字面上
在U型潜艇上航行。

1516
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,100
{\an8}Sorry, lads, we go shorter.

1517
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,100
{\an2}抱歉，伙计们，我们走得更短了。

1518
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,290
{\an8\i1}Drei, zwei, eins...{\i}

1519
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,290
{\an2}三二一...

1520
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,580
{\an8\i1}Gentlemen,
as I speak to you now,{\i}

1521
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,580
{\an2}先生们，

1522
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,190
{\an8\i1}London once again{\i}

1523
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,190
{\an2}再次伦敦

1524
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,920
{\an8\i1}shudders beneath a Nazi
onslaught from the skies.{\i}

1525
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,920
{\an2}在纳粹统治下颤抖

1526
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,260
{\an8\i1}And at such times,{\i}

1527
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,260
{\an2}而在这样的时候，

1528
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,360
{\an8\i1}the hearts of men
are stirred to duty.{\i}

1529
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,360
{\an2}男人的心

1530
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,400
{\an8\i1}But you are not such men.{\i}

1531
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,400
{\an2}但你们不是这样的人。

1532
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,500
{\an8\i1}You were not chosen{\i}

1533
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,500
{\an2}你没有被选中

1534
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,670
{\an8\i1}for your conspicuous honor
or high ideals.{\i}

1535
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,670
{\an2}为了你的显赫荣誉

1536
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,730
{\an8\i1}You were chosen{\i}

1537
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,730
{\an2}你被选中了

1538
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,670
{\an8\i1}because you are
the last resort.{\i}

1539
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,670
{\an2}因为你是

1540
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,870
{\an8\i1}The mission
you have been given{\i}

1541
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,870
{\an2}使命

1542
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:09,440
{\an8\i1}is of a sort
never before undertaken.{\i}

1543
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:09,440
{\an2}是某种

1544
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,120
{\an8\i1}It demands ruthless men,
who will not hesitate{\i}

1545
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,120
{\an2}它需要无情的男人，

1546
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,820
{\an8\i1}to stoop beneath
the conventions of war.{\i}

1547
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,820
{\an2}弯下腰

1548
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,910
{\an8}Men who do not keep clean hands.

1549
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,910
{\an2}不保持双手清洁的男性。

1550
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,560
{\an8}Men like you.

1551
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,560
{\an2}像你这样的男人。

1552
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,360
{\an8\i1}- And yet, who still conspire{\i}

1553
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,360
{\an2}- 然而，谁还在密谋

1554
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,960
{\an8\i1}in their own
discordant harmony.{\i}

1555
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,960
{\an2}在他们自己的

1556
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,760
{\an8\i1}Who know and yet do not care
that they may never return.{\i}

1557
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,760
{\an2}谁知道却不在乎

1558
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,030
{\an8\i1}And who press onward
not for glory,{\i}

1559
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,030
{\an2}以及谁继续前进

1560
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,400
{\an8\i1}or for duty, or for me,{\i}

1561
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,400
{\an2}或为了职责，或为了我，

1562
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,070
{\an8\i1}but because you are men
who will not stop{\i}

1563
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,070
{\an2}但因为你们是男人

1564
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,130
{\an8\i1}until it is done.{\i}

1565
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,130
{\an2}直到完成。

1566
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,610
{\an8\i1}Godspeed, gentlemen.{\i}

1567
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,610
{\an2}祝您好运，先生们。

1568
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,650
{\an8}Uh... Chaps...

1569
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,650
{\an2}呃……伙计们……

1570
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,150
{\an8}That's a British destroyer.

1571
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,150
{\an2}那是一艘英国驱逐舰。

1572
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,670
{\an8}We should move.

1573
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,670
{\an2}我们应该搬家。

1574
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,160
{\an8}We can't outrun that, sir.

1575
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,160
{\an2}我们无法超越，先生。

1576
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,170
{\an8}Well, we've seen them,
they've seen us.

1577
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,170
{\an2}嗯，我们见过他们，
他们见过我们。

1578
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,080
{\an8}Hold fast, {\i1}Maid Honor.{\i}

1579
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,080
{\an2}坚持住，荣誉女仆。

1580
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,880
{\an8}We're preparing
a boarding party.

1581
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,880
{\an2}我们正在准备
登机派对。

1582
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,180
{\an8}Hello, Captain!

1583
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,180
{\an2}你好，队长！

1584
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,510
{\an8}Nothing exciting here.

1585
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,510
{\an2}这里没什么令人兴奋的。

1586
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,520
{\an8}We're just Swedish fishermen.

1587
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,520
{\an2}我们只是瑞典渔民。

1588
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,180
{\an8}Step forward, Jorgensen!

1589
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,180
{\an2}前进吧，乔根森！

1590
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,330
{\an8}Jorgensen, you're Swedish.

1591
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,330
{\an2}乔根森，你是瑞典人。

1592
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,560
{\an8}Ask them where
they're heading, would you?

1593
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,560
{\an2}问他们在哪里
他们正在前进，你会吗？

1594
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,100
{\an8}Not you, Lassen.

1595
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,100
{\an2}不是你，拉森。

1596
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
{\an8}Uh...

1597
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
{\an2}呃...

1598
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,240
{\an8}I want to hear March-Phillips
have a go.

1599
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,240
{\an2}我想听马奇·菲利普斯
试试吧。

1600
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,070
{\an8}Ah.

1601
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,070
{\an2}啊。

1602
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,880
{\an8}Fair enough.

1603
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,880
{\an2}很公平。

1604
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,110
{\an8}Game's up, Commander.

1605
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,110
{\an2}游戏开始了，指挥官。

1606
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,690
{\an8}Can't blame a girl for trying.

1607
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,690
{\an2}不能责怪一个女孩的尝试。

1608
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,110
{\an8}Good effort, Major.

1609
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,110
{\an2}干得好，少校。

1610
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,280
{\an8}But I'm afraid you are going
to have to come with us.

1611
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,280
{\an2}但我担心你会走
必须和我们一起去。

1612
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,090
{\an8}May I ask under whose authority

1613
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,090
{\an2}请问在谁的授权下

1614
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,750
{\an8}we've been waylaid?

1615
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,750
{\an2}我们被伏击了？

1616
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,220
{\an8}On the orders of Admiral Pound.

1617
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,220
{\an2}根据庞德海军上将的命令。

1618
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,230
{\an8}First Lieutenant.

1619
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,230
{\an2}中尉。

1620
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,300
{\an8}You are pursuing

1621
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,300
{\an2}你正在追求

1622
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,070
{\an8}an unsanctioned
criminal enterprise

1623
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,070
{\an2}未经批准的
犯罪企业

1624
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,530
{\an8}in international waters.

1625
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,530
{\an2}在国际水域。

1626
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,570
{\an8}You're going to cause an upset.

1627
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,570
{\an2}你会引起不安。

1628
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:23,140
{\an8}I think we're a little
past upset, Commander.

1629
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:23,140
{\an2}我觉得我们有点
过去的不安，指挥官。

1630
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,670
{\an8}Stevens, what have you got?

1631
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,670
{\an2}史蒂文斯，你有什么？

1632
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:25,810
{\an8}I had a ping, sir.

1633
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:25,810
{\an2}我有一个 ping，先生。

1634
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,150
{\an8}The greedy little Nazi

1635
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,150
{\an2}贪婪的小纳粹

1636
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,710
{\an8}won't be satisfied
with holding most of Europe,

1637
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,710
{\an2}不会满足
拥有欧洲大部分地区，

1638
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,320
{\an8}he's after our own
green and pleasant land.

1639
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,320
{\an2}他在追寻我们自己的
绿色宜人的土地。

1640
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,720
{\an8}Well, thank God you're here

1641
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,720
{\an2}好吧，感谢上帝你在这里

1642
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,920
{\an8}with your little
wooden battleship

1643
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,920
{\an2}和你的小
木制战舰

1644
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,260
{\an8}and your five-man army.

1645
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,260
{\an2}还有你的五人军队。

1646
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,160
{\an8}- U-boat, bearing 273.

1647
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,160
{\an2}- U 型潜艇，方位 273。

1648
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,320
{\an8}- Sound the alarm.

1649
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,320
{\an2}- 拉响警报。

1650
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,890
{\an8}Come aboard.

1651
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,890
{\an2}上船吧。

1652
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,800
{\an8}U-boat approaching.
Starboard side, sir.

1653
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,800
{\an2}U艇接近。
右舷一侧，长官。

1654
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,800
{\an8}Battle stations!

1655
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,800
{\an2}战斗站！

1656
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,340
{\an8}Major, if you know
what's good for you,

1657
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,340
{\an2}少校，如果你知道的话
什么对你有好处，

1658
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,900
{\an8}- you'll head home.
- Very good, Commander.

1659
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,900
{\an2}- 你会回家。
- 很好，指挥官。

1660
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,910
{\an8}Haysey, get us away
from that torpedo magnet

1661
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,910
{\an2}海西，带我们走吧
从那个鱼雷磁铁

1662
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,240
{\an8}as quickly as possible.

1663
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,240
{\an2}尽快。

1664
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,700
{\an8}Aye, sir. Apple, man the stern.

1665
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,700
{\an2}好的，先生。苹果，船尾的人。

1666
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,250
{\an8}Freddy, on the main sail.

1667
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,250
{\an2}弗雷迪，在主帆上。

1668
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,540
{\an8}Lassen to the bow, now.
Untie that station!

1669
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,540
{\an2}拉森到船头，现在。
解开那个站！

1670
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,920
{\an8}Aye.

1671
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,920
{\an2}机会。

1672
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,390
{\an8}Quickly now, lads!

1673
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,390
{\an2}现在快点，小伙子们！

1674
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:07,490
{\an8}Hoist that foresail for us,
will you, boys?

1675
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:07,490
{\an2}为我们起航，
孩子们，你愿意吗？

1676
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,590
{\an8}Main sail ready to haul!

1677
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,590
{\an2}主帆准备好牵引！

1678
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,420
{\an8}All right, Freddy,
now raise that main sail!

1679
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,420
{\an2}好吧，弗雷迪，
现在升起主帆！

1680
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,760
{\an8}Aye.

1681
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,760
{\an2}机会。

1682
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,170
{\an8}-Report sounding.

1683
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,170
{\an2}- 报告声音。

1684
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,670
{\an8}-Bearing 163.

1685
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,670
{\an2}-轴承163。

1686
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:31,640
{\an8}Lassen, trim the main sail

1687
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:31,640
{\an2}拉森，调整主帆

1688
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,210
{\an8}and then tie it off!

1689
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,210
{\an2}然后把它系起来！

1690
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,610
{\an8}How do you expect good?

1691
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,610
{\an2}你怎么期待好呢？

1692
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,580
{\an8}Report sounding.

1693
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,580
{\an2}报告发声。

1694
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,290
{\an8}Bearing 115.

1695
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,290
{\an2}轴承115。

1696
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,380
{\an8}-Fire depth charges.

1697
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,380
{\an2}-火力深水炸弹。

1698
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,490
{\an8}So, this is your man
that gets things done?

1699
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,490
{\an2}所以，这就是你的男人
能把事情做好吗？

1700
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,350
{\an8}His name is Kamp Billy...
with a K.

1701
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,350
{\an2}他的名字叫坎普·比利……
与 K。

1702
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,030
{\an8}And he went
to an English boarding school?

1703
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,030
{\an2}他去了
去英国寄宿学校？

1704
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,540
{\an8}Not just any boarding school.
He went to Eton,

1705
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,540
{\an2}不仅仅是任何寄宿学校。
他去了伊顿公学，

1706
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,360
{\an8}the boarding school.

1707
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,360
{\an2}寄宿学校。

1708
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,870
{\an8}Right...

1709
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,870
{\an2}正确的...

1710
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:39,680
{\an8}Then what's he doing here?

1711
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:39,680
{\an2}那他来这里做什么？

1712
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,840
{\an8}He's a prince.

1713
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,840
{\an2}他是一位王子。

1714
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,290
{\an8}A prince of what, exactly?

1715
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,290
{\an2}到底是什么王子？

1716
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:47,220
{\an8}- The Prince of Fernando Po!

1717
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:47,220
{\an2}- 费尔南多·波王子！

1718
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,380
{\an8}So, he's part pirate,
part aristocrat?

1719
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,380
{\an2}所以，他有一部分是海盗，
部分贵族？

1720
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,460
{\an8}Chic.

1721
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,460
{\an2}别致。

1722
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,390
{\an8}He's also
a part of our solution.

1723
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,390
{\an2}他也是
我们解决方案的一部分。

1724
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,030
{\an8}RH.

1725
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,030
{\an2}相对湿度。

1726
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,960
{\an8}KB.

1727
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,960
{\an2}知识库。

1728
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,900
{\an8}He's back in town.

1729
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,900
{\an2}他回到城里了。

1730
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,770
{\an8}Chief.

1731
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,770
{\an2}首席。

1732
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,410
{\an8}Seems like
you always come bearing gifts.

1733
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,410
{\an2}似乎
你总是带着礼物来。

1734
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,910
{\an8}Is she for me?

1735
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,910
{\an2}她是为了我吗？

1736
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,410
{\an8}- Good luck with that.

1737
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,410
{\an2}- 祝你好运。

1738
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,410
{\an8}I'm not for you,

1739
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,410
{\an2}我不是为了你，

1740
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,090
{\an8}but these are.

1741
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,090
{\an2}但这些是。

1742
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,430
{\an8}Mmm. Goodies. Yummy.

1743
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,430
{\an2}嗯。好东西。好吃。

1744
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,420
{\an8}-  Ade...
- Chief.

1745
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,420
{\an2}- 出色地...
- 酋长。

1746
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,860
{\an8}Come on, come on.

1747
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,860
{\an2}好啦好啦。

1748
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,840
{\an8}Someone has taste.

1749
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,840
{\an2}有人有品味。

1750
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,730
{\an8}Rarer than hens' teeth.

1751
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,730
{\an2}比母鸡的牙齿还稀有。

1752
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:45,310
{\an8}Well, RH tells me that KB

1753
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:45,310
{\an2}嗯，RH 告诉我 KB

1754
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:46,910
{\an8}is the only man to talk to

1755
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:46,910
{\an2}是唯一可以交谈的人

1756
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,550
{\an8}when it comes
to getting things done.

1757
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,550
{\an2}当谈到
把事情做好。

1758
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,290
{\an8}Why do I feel like
I've gone from being

1759
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,290
{\an2}为什么我感觉
我已经离开了

1760
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,620
{\an8}- the predator to the prey?

1761
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,620
{\an2}- 捕食者对猎物？

1762
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,960
{\an8}Quite an entrance, young lady.

1763
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,960
{\an2}相当不错的入口，年轻的女士。

1764
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,630
{\an8}It's on the condition
that we sample them...

1765
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,630
{\an2}是有条件的
我们对它们进行采样...

1766
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,830
{\an8}now.

1767
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,830
{\an2}现在。

1768
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,730
{\an8}Ade, set the table.

1769
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,730
{\an2}艾德，摆桌子。

1770
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,800
{\an8}Chief.

1771
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,800
{\an2}首席。

1772
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,210
{\an8}And then the Duke said,

1773
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,210
{\an2}然后公爵说：

1774
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:16,910
{\an8}"Push it in till it stops!"

1775
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:16,910
{\an2}“把它推进去，直到它停止为止！”

1776
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,180
{\an8}You are quite the weapon.

1777
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,180
{\an2}你真是个武器。

1778
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,850
{\an8}I was right,

1779
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,850
{\an2}我是对的，

1780
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,050
{\an8}I was the prey.

1781
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,050
{\an2}我是猎物。

1782
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,760
{\an8}I'll help you
because I don't like Nazis.

1783
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,760
{\an2}我会帮你
因为我不喜欢纳粹。

1784
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,800
{\an8}Not because they're Nazis
but because they're gauche.

1785
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,800
{\an2}不是因为他们是纳粹分子
但因为他们很粗鲁。

1786
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,790
{\an8}I'll give you a tug
and 12 of my best men,

1787
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,790
{\an2}我给你拉一下
和我最好的12个人，

1788
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,330
{\an8}including yours truly.

1789
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,330
{\an2}包括你真正的。

1790
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,830
{\an8}But if I'm gonna help you,
who's gonna help me?

1791
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,830
{\an2}但如果我要帮助你的话
谁来帮助我？

1792
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,740
{\an8}Because you're
not a soldier, RH.

1793
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,740
{\an2}因为你是
不是士兵，RH。

1794
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,310
{\an8}No, but she is.

1795
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,310
{\an2}不，但她是。

1796
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,010
{\an8}She'll outshoot your best man.

1797
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,010
{\an2}她会超越你的伴郎。

1798
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:34,950
{\an8}I told you.

1799
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:34,950
{\an2}我告诉你了。

1800
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,290
{\an8}- No!
- No!

1801
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,290
{\an2}- 不！
- 不！

1802
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,960
{\an8}Stork delivery. Check.

1803
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,960
{\an2}鹳交付。查看。

1804
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,300
{\an8}Check.

1805
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,300
{\an2}查看。

1806
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,970

{\an8}Can you get us there?

1819
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,720
{\an2}你能带我们去那里吗？

1820
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,050
{\an8}If the weather holds,

1821
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,050
{\an2}如果天气好的话，

1822
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,290
{\an8}I can, sir.

1823
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,290

1824
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,310

this doesn't end well.

{\an2}二十英镑说
这结局并不好。

1826
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,180

1827
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,180

{\an8}For them.

1829
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,280
{\an2}对于他们来说。

1830
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,610
{\an8}You can't bet on yourself,
Haysey. That's match-fixing.

1831
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,610
{\an2}你不能把赌注押在自己身上
海西。这就是比赛造假。

1832
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,610
{\an8}Let's do it.

1833
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,610

{\an2}海伦，好久不见了。

1836
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,090
{\an8}Good to see you, Gus.

1837

费尔南多·波亲王。

1843
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,930
{\an2}殿下。

1844
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,430
{\an8}He's agreed to help us.

1845
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,430
{\an2}他同意帮助我们。

1846
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,100
{\an8}Forgive me, but...

1847
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,100
{\an2}请原谅我，但是...

1848
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,070
{\an8}I have a peculiar feeling
that we've met before.

1849
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,070
{\an2}我有一种奇特的感觉
我们以前见过。

1850
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:04,740
{\an8}I get that a lot.
I'm extremely well-traveled.

1851
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:04,740
{\an2}我对此深有体会。
我经常出差。

1852
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,140
{\an8}No, no.
It's a particular sense.

1853
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,140
{\an2}不，不。
这是一种特殊的感觉。

1854
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,320
{\an8}I don't suppose
you played cricket, did you?

1855
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,320
{\an2}我不认为
你打板球，是吗？

1856
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,190
{\an8}Captained Eton. '21 to '22.

1857
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,190
{\an2}伊顿队长。 '21 至 '22。

1858
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,530
{\an8}I knew I knew your face!

1859
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,530
{\an2}我就知道我认识你的脸！

1860
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,530
{\an8}Right next
to the trophy cabinet.

1861
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,530
{\an2}下一个
到奖杯柜。

1862
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,300
{\an8}An eight-foot-tall
huge portrait.

1863
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,300
{\an2}一个八英尺高
巨大的肖像。

1864
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,200
{\an8}Yes, exactly that!

1865
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,200
{\an2}是的，正是如此！

1866
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,570
{\an8}One eye on the boundary...

1867
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,570
{\an2}一只眼睛盯着边界……

1868
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:31,160
{\an8}...one eye on the pub.

1869
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:31,160
{\an2}...一只眼睛盯着酒吧。

1870
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,740
{\an8}Bloody glad to have you aboard.

1871
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,740
{\an2}非常高兴你能加入。

1872
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,340
{\an8}Bloody good
to be here, old boy.

1873
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,340
{\an2}太棒了
来这里，老男孩。

1874
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,810
{\an8}I'm very bored

1875
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,810
{\an2}我感到很无聊

1876
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,810
{\an8}with these Nazis making
a nuisance of themselves.

1877
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,810
{\an2}与这些纳粹分子一起
他们自己的麻烦。

1878
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:40,350
{\an8}I mean,
it's terrible for business.

1879
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:40,350
{\an2}我是说，
这对生意来说太糟糕了。

1880
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,180
{\an8}I'm only too pleased

1881
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,180
{\an2}我简直太高兴了

1882
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,350
{\an8}to help you
serve them a bloody nose.

1883
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,350
{\an2}来帮你
让他们流鼻血。

1884
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,150
{\an8}That's a commendable attitude.

1885
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,150
{\an2}这是一种值得称赞的态度。

1886
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,920
{\an8}So, what's your plan?

1887
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,920
{\an2}那么，你的计划是什么？

1888
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,060
{\an8}Apple.

1889
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,060
{\an2}苹果。

1890
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,420
{\an8}We're going
to sink the {\i1}Duchessa,{\i}

1891
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,420
{\an2}本来打算
沉没公爵夫人，

1892
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,190
{\an8}plus the two tugs.

1893
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,190
{\an2}加上两个拖船。

1894
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,360
{\an8}Crippling Hitler's
Atlantic fleet of U-boats.

1895
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,360
{\an2}残害希特勒
大西洋舰队的U型潜艇。

1896
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,900
{\an8}Very good.

1897
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,900
{\an2}非常好。

1898
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,370
{\an8}The thing is,
our old friends the Nazis

1899
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,370
{\an2}事情是，
我们的老朋友纳粹

1900
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,830
{\an8}aren't making it the easiest.

1901
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,830
{\an2}并没有让它变得最简单。

1902
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:04,070
{\an8}We're outnumbered
two hundred to five.

1903
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:04,070
{\an2}我们寡不敌众
两百比五。

1904
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,740
{\an8}There's a few more soldiers
than we anticipated.

1905
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,740
{\an2}还有几个士兵
比我们预期的。

1906
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,170
{\an8}I think that we're gonna have

1907
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,170
{\an2}我想我们将会有

1908
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,210
{\an8}to find ourselves
a few more strapping lads.

1909
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,210
{\an2}找到我们自己
还有几个身材魁梧的小伙子。

1910
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,280
{\an8}Ade...

1911
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,280
{\an2}嘿...

1912
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,720
{\an8}Right...

1913
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,720
{\an2}正确的...

1914
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,900
{\an8}Yes, I think that will do.

1915
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,900
{\an2}是的，我想这样就可以了。

1916
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:32,860
{\an8}We brought some weapons
if you need.

1917
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:32,860
{\an2}我们带了一些武器
如果你需要。

1918
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,060
{\an8}You hold onto those.
We brought our own.

1919
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,060
{\an2}你抓住那些。
我们带了自己的。

1920
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,280
{\an8}Oyah!
Show them the iron!

1921
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,280
{\an2}哎哟！
给他们看铁！

1922
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,940
{\an8}Marvelous.

1923
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,940
{\an2}奇妙。

1924
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,470
{\an8}You do know
the {\i1}Duchessa{\i} is

1925
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,470
{\an2}你确实知道
公爵夫人是

1926
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,880
{\an8}more than 200 feet
from the harbor side?

1927
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,880
{\an2}超过200英尺
从港口一侧？

1928
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,480
{\an8}And she's in full glare
of the lights.

1929
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,480
{\an2}而她却在众目睽睽之下
的灯。

1930
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,410
{\an8}She's not gonna be easy to sink

1931
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,410
{\an2}她不会轻易沉没

1932
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,480
{\an8}without attracting
unwanted attention.

1933
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,480
{\an2}不吸引
不必要的关注。

1934
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,820
{\an8}Yes. That's why Heron
will plant a bomb

1935
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,820
{\an2}是的。这就是为什么苍鹭
会安放炸弹

1936
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:01,220
{\an8}to blow the lights,
before we paddle in

1937
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:01,220
{\an2}吹灯，
在我们划桨之前

1938
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,090
{\an8}and rig the hull
with explosives.

1939
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,090
{\an2}并安装船体
与炸药。

1940
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,470
{\an8}By the time
the explosives detonate,

1941
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,470
{\an2}到......的时候
炸药爆炸，

1942
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,770
{\an8}we'll be heading home.

1943
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,770
{\an2}我们要回家了。

1944
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,930
{\an8}If I had it my way,
a shot'll never be fired.

1945
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,930
{\an2}如果我按照自己的方式行事的话
永远不会开枪。

1946
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,510
{\an8}And how often
do you have it your way?

1947
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,510
{\an2}以及多久一次
你有办法吗？

1948
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,510
{\an8}Depends on who you ask, old boy.

1949
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,510
{\an2}这取决于你问谁，老男孩。

1950
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:17,840
{\an8}Gentlemen...

1951
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:17,840
{\an2}先生们...

1952
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,270
{\an8}- Ade.
- Chief.

1953
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,270
{\an2}- 阿德。
- 酋长。

1954
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,340
{\an8}- Prepare the men.

1955
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,340
{\an2}- 准备人员。

1956
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,410
{\an8}I'll take that 20
whenever you're ready, Freddy.

1957
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,410
{\an2}我要那20个
只要你准备好，弗雷迪。

1958
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:43,800
{\an8}The {\i1}Duchessa{\i}
will be gone by the morning.

1959
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:43,800
{\an2}公爵夫人
到早上就会消失。

1960
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,370
{\an8}- Can you manage that?

1961
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,370
{\an2}- 你能做到吗？

1962
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,800
{\an8}It's two wires and a tick-tock.

1963
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,800
{\an2}它是两根电线和一个滴答声。

1964
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,510
{\an8}I'm sure I can cope.

1965
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,510
{\an2}我确信我能应付。

1966
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,180
{\an8}It's not me you should be
worried about.

1967
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,180
{\an2}你应该不是我
担心。

1968
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,810
{\an8}I've never
taken a Nazi to a party.

1969
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,810
{\an2}我从来没有
带纳粹去参加聚会。

1970
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,620
{\an8}Just don't end up
at one of his parties.

1971
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,620
{\an2}只是不要结束
在他的一个聚会上。

1972
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,820
{\an8}Don't worry about me.

1973
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,820
{\an2}别担心我。

1974
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,900
{\an8}I'm gonna have
my own little party.

1975
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,900
{\an2}我将会有
我自己的小聚会。

1976
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,140
{\an8}Drink for the boys,
on His Majesty's government.

1977
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,140
{\an2}给男生喝，
关于国王陛下的政府。

1978
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,980
{\an8}Ordinarily,
I'd bite your hand off,

1979
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,980
{\an2}按说，
我会咬掉你的手

1980
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,320
{\an8}as I have been known
to love a pound note.

1981
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,320
{\an2}据我所知
喜欢一英镑纸币。

1982
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,220
{\an8}But on this occasion,

1983
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,220
{\an2}但在这一次，

1984
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,850
{\an8}the drinks are on me.

1985
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,850
{\an2}饮料由我来。

1986
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,660
{\an8}However,

1987
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,660
{\an2}然而，

1988
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,900
{\an8}if His Majesty's government
was handing out titles...

1989
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,900
{\an2}如果国王陛下的政府
正在分发头衔...

1990
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,000
{\an8}You're already a prince,
old boy.

1991
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,000
{\an2}你已经是王子了
老男孩。

1992
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,370
{\an8}There's Prince
of Fernando Po, but...

1993
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,370
{\an2}那里有王子
费尔南多·波，但是。

1994
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:56,240
{\an8}a Knight of the Realm
has a certain antiquity to it.

1995
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:56,240
{\an2}王国的骑士
它有一定的古老性。

1996
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,110
{\an8}Arise, Sir Kamp Billy.

1997
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,110
{\an2}起来，坎普·比利爵士。

1998
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,880
{\an8}You're a good man, Gus.

1999
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,880
{\an2}你是个好人，格斯。

2000
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,880
{\an8}Good luck, Billy.

{\an2}谢谢你，蒂莫西。

2016
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,190
{\an8}One second.

2017
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,190
{\an2}一秒。

2018
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:22,880
{\an8}Timothy...

2019
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:22,880

{\an2}我有还盘。

2022
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,930
{\an8}Let's put
this dressing up aside.

2023
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,930
{\an2}让我们把
这打扮放在一边。

2024
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:31,660
{\an8}It's for children.
And we are not children.

2025
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:31,660
{\an2}这是给孩子们的。
而且我们不是孩子。

2026
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,240
{\an8}Let's make our own party.

2027
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,240

01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,940
{\an2}一个黑暗的纳粹党。

2032
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:47,210
{\an8}With music, lubrication
and a handsome Nazi.

2033
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:47,210
{\an2}配合音乐、润滑
还有一个英俊的纳粹分子。

2034
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,020
{\an8}Since I've been here,

2035
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,020
{\an2}自从我来到这里，

2036
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:53,220
{\an8}I've been bitten by things
that croak and slither,

2037
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:53,220
{\an2}我被东西咬了
那呱呱叫和滑行的声音，

2038
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,320
{\an8}scorpions nest in my boots
and I can't sleep

2039
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,320
{\an2}蝎子在我的靴子里筑巢
我无法入睡

2040
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,360
{\an8}for the relentless howl
of jungle entropy.

2041
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,360
{\an2}为了无情的嚎叫
丛林熵。

2042
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:59,320
{\an8}Tonight,

2043
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:59,320
{\an2}今晚，

2044
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,360

{\an2}我要去参加那个聚会
你正在带我。

2046
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,140
{\an8}Now, put it on.

01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,140
{\an2}现在，穿上它。

2048
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,370
{\an8}Oh.

2049
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,370

{\an2}很好。

2052
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,610
{\an8}Ah! {\i1}Hola!{\i}

2053
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,610
{\an2}啊!你好！

2054
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,260
{\an8}We move when the lights go out.

2055
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,260
{\an2}灯灭后我们就移动。

2056
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,140
{\an8}All right, Ricardo,

2057
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,140
{\an2}好吧，里卡多，

2058
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:33,280
{\an8}today you're {\i1}El Capitan.{\i}

2059
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:33,280
{\an2}今天你是埃尔卡皮坦。

2060
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,820
{\an8}Armando, the bar is yours.

2061
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,820
{\an2}阿曼多，酒吧是你的了。

2062
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,060
{\an8}Use it. Abuse it at your will.

2063
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,060
{\an2}用它。随心所欲地滥用它。

2064
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,860
{\an8}That's why I love you.

2065
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,860
{\an2}这就是为什么我爱你。

2066
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,660
{\an8}Come with me, handsome.

2067
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,660
{\an2}跟我来吧，帅哥。

2068
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,200
{\an8}I need you
to keep the men happy.

{\an2}我需要你
为了让男人们开心。

2070

2071
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:52,740
{\an2}多么高兴？

2072
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:12,180
{\an8}Mmm.

2073
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:12,180
{\an2}嗯。

2074
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,460
{\an8}Are the rats in the nest?

2075
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,460
{\an2}老鼠在窝里吗？

2076
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:21,060
{\an8}You won't find a German,
Spanish or Italian officer

2077
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:21,060
{\an2}你找不到德国人
西班牙或意大利官员

2078
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,500
{\an8}anywhere else tonight.

2079
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,500
{\an2}今晚还有其他地方。

2080
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:29,910
{\an8}Between the beer fest
at the harbor

2081

{\an2}啤酒节之间
在港口

2082
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,680
{\an8}and this little get-together,

2083
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,680
{\an2}还有这次小小的聚会，

away from the dock.

2085
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,040
{\an2}那将是90%的士兵
远离码头。

2086

{\an8}The charge is set
to blow the harbor lights

2087
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,550
{\an2}收费已设定
吹灭港口灯光

2088

2089
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,420
{\an2}30分钟后。

2090
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:42,550
{\an8}Can you keep him here that long?

2091
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:42,550
{\an2}你能把他留在这里这么久吗？

2092
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:45,220
{\an8}Silly boy, silly question.
Look at the dress.

2093
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:45,220
{\an2}愚蠢的孩子，愚蠢的问题。
看看这件衣服。

2094
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:56,770
{\an8}Hi.

2095
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:56,770
{\an2}你好。

2096
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:59,030
{\an8}So, you call this a party?

2097
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:59,030
{\an2}所以，你管这叫派对？

2098
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:00,700
{\an8}This is just
the thin end of the wedge.

2099
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:00,700
{\an2}这只是
楔子的薄端。

2100
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,310
{\an8}I've created a performance
just for you.

2101
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,310
{\an2}我创作了一场表演
只为你。

2102
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,110
{\an8}Well, I could show you
a real party.

2103
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,110
{\an2}好吧，我可以告诉你
一个真正的聚会。

2104
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,770
{\an8}Why do I care, Spaghetti?

2105
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,770
{\an2}我为什么要关心，意大利面？

2106
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,080
{\an8}Pizza.

2107
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,080
{\an2}比萨。

2108
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,180
{\an8}Excuse me
while I powder my nose.

2109
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,180
{\an2}打扰一下
当我搽鼻涕的时候。

2110
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,070
{\an8}- What, again?

2111
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,070
{\an2}- 又是什么？

2112
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,540
{\an8}Don't panic, Caesar.
Brush up on your Italian.

2113
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,540
{\an2}别惊慌，凯撒。
温习一下意大利语。

2114
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,190
{\an8}Your gift needs to be wrapped.

2115
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,190
{\an2}你的礼物需要包装。

2116
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,090
{\an8}Keep those officers
drinking, please.

2117
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,090
{\an2}留住那些军官
请喝酒。

2118
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,080
{\an8}- Of course. Okay.
- Thank you, Femi.

2119
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,080
{\an2}- 当然。好的。
- 谢谢你，费米。

2120
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,950
{\an8}The {\i1}Duchessa's{\i} hull
has been reinforced.

2121
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,950
{\an2}公爵夫人号的船体
已得到加强。

2122
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:53,790
{\an8}It won't sink.

2123
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:53,790
{\an2}它不会沉没。

2124
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,360
{\an8}We need to stop the mission.

2125
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,360
{\an2}我们需要停止任务。

2126
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,430
{\an8}That's going to be hard to do.

2127
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,430
{\an2}这将很难做到。

2128
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,040
{\an8}Listen to me.

2129
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,040
{\an2}听我说。

2130
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,440
{\an8}Our mission will fail.

2131
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,440
{\an2}我们的使命将会失败。

2132
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,740
{\an8}The explosives won't work

2133
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,740
{\an2}炸药不起作用

2134
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,300
{\an8}because he's reinforced it
to be unsinkable.

2135
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,300
{\an2}因为他强化了它
不沉的。

2136
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,010
{\an8}You have to stop them now.

2137
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,010
{\an2}你现在必须阻止他们。

2138
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,980
{\an8}But the charge is about
to blow the lights.

2139
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,980
{\an2}但收费约为
吹灯。

2140
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,050
{\an8}Well, if you can't
stop the lights,

2141
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,050
{\an2}好吧，如果你不能
停止灯光，

2142
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,190
{\an8}stop the men.

2143
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,190
{\an2}阻止男人们。

2144
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,020
{\an8}Luhr must not leave this party.

2145
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,020
{\an2}鲁尔不能离开这个政党。

2146
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,960
{\an8}I'll keep him busy. Go, now.

2147
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,960
{\an2}我会让他忙起来。现在出发。

2148
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:10,070
{\an8}And we're off.

2149
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:10,070
{\an2}我们出发了。

2150
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:11,430
{\an8}Gus, wait.

2151
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:11,430
{\an2}格斯，等等。

2152
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,560
{\an8}Stork to Maid,
Stork to Maid, come in.

2153
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,560
{\an2}鹳鸟对女仆，
鹳鸟对女仆说，进来吧。

2154
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,290
{\an8}Channel five.

2155
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,290
{\an2}第五频道。

2156
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,390
{\an8\i1}This is Maid. Switching to 20.{\i}

2157
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,390
{\an2}这是女仆。切换到20。

2158
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,140
{\an8\i1}Go ahead.{\i}

2159
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,140
{\an2}前进。

2160
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,260
{\an8}Tin of corned beef
can't be cracked.

2161
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,260
{\an2}罐头咸牛肉
无法破解。

2162
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,610
{\an8\i1}The ship cannot be sunk.{\i}

2163
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,610
{\an2}船不可能沉没。

2164
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:49,240
{\an8\i1}Explosives will fail.{\i}

2165
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:49,240
{\an2}炸药会失效。

2166
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,870
{\an8}It's Stork, sir.

2167
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,870
{\an2}这是鹳鸟，先生。

2168
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,880
{\an8}Put him on open speaker.

2169
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,880
{\an2}将他放在开放式扬声器上。

2170
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,980
{\an8\i1}Corned beef
can't be cracked.{\i}

2171
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,980
{\an2}咸牛肉

2172
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:57,910
{\an8}Stork, this is M.

2173
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:57,910
{\an2}鹳鸟，这是M。

2174
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,980
{\an8}Never mind the corned beef.
Just find a way.

2175
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,980
{\an2}别介意咸牛肉。
就找个办法吧。

2176
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,180
{\an8}- Over.
- Pound incoming, sir.

2177
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,180
{\an2}- 超过。
- 英镑来了，先生。

2178
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,490
{\an8}-{\i1}Repeat...{\i}
- Switch that off.

2179
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,490
{\an2}-重复...
- 把它关掉。

2180
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,460
{\an8\i1}- We must...{\i}

2181
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,460
{\an2}- 我们必须...

2182
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:08,390
{\an8}Stop this immediately.

2183
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:08,390
{\an2}立即停止这种行为。

2184
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:11,430
{\an8}What you are doing ends now,

2185
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:11,430
{\an2}你正在做的事现在结束了

2186
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,720
{\an8}or every last one of you
will be subject to a tribunal.

2187
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,720
{\an2}或你们每一个最后的人
将受法庭管辖。

2188
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,570
{\an8}Is that clear?

2189
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,570
{\an2}明白了吗？

2190
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,600
{\an8}I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

2191
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,600
{\an2}我不知道什么
你说的是，先生。

2192
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,430
{\an8}Is that correct, Sergeant?

2193
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,430
{\an2}是这样吗，中士？

2194
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,540
{\an8\i1}Hold position.{\i}

2195
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,540
{\an2}坚守阵地。

2196
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,840
{\an8\i1}How long, Stork?{\i}

2197
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,840
{\an2}还要多久，鹳鸟？

2198
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,920
{\an8}-{\i1}Awaiting orders.{\i}
- Give me that.

2199
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,920
{\an2}-等待命令。
- 给我那个。

2200
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,820
{\an8\i1}Stand by.{\i}

2201
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,820
{\an2}支持。

2202
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,340
{\an8}March-Phillips,

2203
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,340
{\an2}马奇·菲利普斯，

2204
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,190
{\an8}this is Admiral Pound
giving you a direct order.

2205
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,190
{\an2}这是庞德海军上将
给你一个直接的命令。

2206
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:37,920
{\an8}Abort this mission now.

2207
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:37,920
{\an2}立即中止此任务。

2208
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,120
{\an8\i1}I will make sure that{\i}

2209
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,120
{\an2}我会确保

2210
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,050
{\an8\i1}none of you see
the light of day again.{\i}

2211
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,050
{\an2}你们谁也看不到

2212
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,530
{\an8\i1}You will spend
the rest of your lives{\i}

2213
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,530
{\an2}你将花费

2214
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,430
{\an8\i1}locked up
at His Majesty's pleasure.{\i}

2215
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,430
{\an2}锁上

2216
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:45,300
{\an8\i1}That includes all of you.{\i}

2217
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:45,300
{\an2}这包括你们所有人。

2218
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,130
{\an8\i1}Geoffrey Appleyard,{\i}

2219
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,130
{\an2}杰弗里·阿普尔亚德,

2220
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:48,300
{\an8\i1}Anders Lassen,{\i}

2221
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:48,300
{\an2}让它变得不同，

2222
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,300
{\an8\i1}- Freddy Buzz...{\i}
-I'm sorry...

{\an2}- 弗莱迪·巴兹...

{\an2}...还有亨利·海耶斯。

2226
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,800
{\an8}Can't quite make out

2227
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,800
{\an2}不太明白

2228
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,970
{\an8}- what you're saying.

2229
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,970
{\an2}- 你在讲些什么。

2230
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,040
{\an8}Bye.

2231
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,040
{\an2}再见。

2232
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,340
{\an8}- Is... Is that clear?

2233
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,340
{\an2}- 是……清楚了吗？

2234
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,040
{\an8\i1}Sorry? What?{\i}

2235
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,040
{\an2}对不起？什么？

2236
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,910
{\an8\i1}I can't...
I can't quite hear you.{\i}

2237
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,910
{\an2}我不能...

2238
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,470
{\an8\i1}Please... fuck off.{\i}

2239
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,470
{\an2}拜托……滚蛋吧。

2240
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,150
{\an8}You and your operation
are reckless, Brigadier.

2241
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,150
{\an2}您和您的运营
是鲁莽的，准将。

2242
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,220
{\an8}I will personally
advise parliament

2243
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,220
{\an2}我个人会
向议会提供建议

2244
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:17,390
{\an8}to have the Prime Minister
removed from office.

2245
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:17,390
{\an2}有首相
被免职。

2246
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,130
{\an8}And I am going to shut you down.

2247
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,130
{\an2}我会关闭你的。

2248
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:23,360
{\an8}Message received
loud and clear, sir.

2249
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:23,360
{\an2}收到消息
响亮而清晰，先生。

2250
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:32,810
{\an8}I suggest you also
fuck off, Sergeant.

2251
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:32,810
{\an2}我建议你也
滚蛋吧，中士。

2252
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,510
{\an8}Fleming, contact March-Phillips.

2253
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,510
{\an2}弗莱明，请联系马奇-菲利普斯。

2254
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:40,550
{\an8}Lily, get me
the Prime Minister on hotline.

2255
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:40,550
{\an2}莉莉，来找我吧
总理热线电话。

2256
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:41,850
{\an8}-{\i1}Right away, sir.{\i}
- Come in, 01.

2257
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:41,850
{\an2}-马上，先生。
- 进来吧，01。

2258
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,250
{\an8}Come in, do you receive?

2259
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,250
{\an2}进来吧，收到了吗？

2260
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:49,860
{\an8}- Yes?
-{\i1}Prime Minister,{\i}

2261
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:49,860
{\an2}- 是的？
-总理，

2262
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,520
{\an8\i1}I'm afraid
we've been discovered.{\i}

2263
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,520
{\an2}我耽心

2264
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,830
{\an8}There was a mole in our midst

2265
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,830
{\an2}我们中间有一颗内奸

2266
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:57,060
{\an8}and Admiral Pound

2267
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:57,060
{\an2}和庞德海军上将

2268
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,970
{\an8}has ordered the mission
to be aborted.

2269
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,970
{\an2}已下令执行任务
被中止。

2270
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,530
{\an8\i1}He wants to have parliament
remove you from office.{\i}

2271
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,530
{\an2}他希望有议会

2272
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:04,000
{\an8}The mission must continue.

2273
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:04,000
{\an2}使命必须继续下去。

2274
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,640
{\an8}01, this is base. Over.

2275
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,640
{\an2}01，这是基地。超过。

2276
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,010
{\an8\i1}Tell Pound
if he has a problem,{\i}

2277
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,010
{\an2}告诉庞德

2278
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:09,150
{\an8\i1}to take it up with me.
He knows where I live.{\i}

2279
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:09,150
{\an2}和我一起解决这个问题。

2280
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,880
{\an8\i1}Tell the men to press on.{\i}

2281
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,880
{\an2}告诉男人们继续前进。

2282
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,210
{\an8}I'm afraid we've lost
all communication, sir.

2283
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,210
{\an2}恐怕我们已经输了
所有通讯，先生。

2284
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,290
{\an8}There must be
something that we can do.

2285
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,290
{\an2}必须有
我们可以做的事情。

2286
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,260
{\an8}The only thing
I can do is remind you,

2287
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,260
{\an2}唯一的事情
我能做的就是提醒你，

2288
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,460
{\an8}the reason
we chose March-Phillips

2289
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,460
{\an2}原因
我们选择了马奇-菲利普斯

2290
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,800
{\an8\i1}is because
he doesn't follow orders.{\i}

2291
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,800
{\an2}是因为

2292
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,360
{\an8}Then let's hope we chose well.

2293
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,360
{\an2}那么希望我们选择得好。

2294
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:38,070
{\an8}The {\i1}Duchessa's{\i} hull
has been reinforced.

2295
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:38,070
{\an2}公爵夫人号的船体
已得到加强。

2296
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:40,040
{\an8}Which means she can't be sunk.

2297
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:40,040
{\an2}这意味着她不能沉没。

2298
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,380
{\an8}At least not with the amount
of explosives we're carrying.

2299
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,380
{\an2}至少没有金额
我们携带的炸药。

2300
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,720
{\an8}Just wondering how and when
exactly this took place.

2301
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,720
{\an2}只是想知道如何以及何时
这正是发生的。

2302
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,590
{\an8}It's not important
how and when, it's happened.

2303
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,590
{\an2}这并不重要
它是如何以及何时发生的。

2304
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,650
{\an8}Well, it is
kind of important, Gus.

2305
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,650
{\an2}嗯，是的
有点重要，格斯。

2306
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,760
{\an8}I don't care
about the prison time,

2307
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,760
{\an2}我不在乎
关于入狱时间，

2308
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,650
{\an8}but I do care about finishing
what we've started.

2309
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,650
{\an2}但我确实关心完成
我们已经开始的事情。

2310
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,020
{\an8}Thank you, Freddy.

2311
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,020
{\an2}谢谢你，弗雷迪。

2312
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,130
{\an8}There must be
some sort of mistake.

2313
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,130
{\an2}必须有
某种错误。

2314
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:57,260
{\an8}You can't just reinforce...

2315
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:57,260
{\an2}你不能只是强化...

2316
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,090
{\an8}There's no mistake, Haysey.

2317
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,090
{\an2}没有错，海西。

2318
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:00,860
{\an8}I'm just lost about
how and when exactly...

2319
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:00,860
{\an2}我只是迷失了
具体如何以及何时...

2320
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,100
{\an8}- Enough!

2321
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,100
{\an2}- 足够的！

2322
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,110
{\an8}Why don't we sink the tug boats?

2323
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,110
{\an2}为什么我们不击沉拖船呢？

2324
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:15,080
{\an8}Get rid of the shuttle
to the U-boats.

2325
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:15,080
{\an2}摆脱班车
到U型潜艇。

2326
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,110
{\an8}It's not enough.

2327
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,110
{\an2}这不够。

2328
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,180
{\an8}They'll replace them in a week.

2329
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,180
{\an2}他们将在一周内更换它们。

2330
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,490
{\an8}Why don't we steal them?

2331
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,490
{\an2}我们为什么不偷它们呢？

2332
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,900
{\an8}We can use Billy's boat

2333
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,900
{\an2}我们可以使用比利的船

2334
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,730
{\an8}to drag the {\i1}Duchessa{\i}
out of the harbor

2335
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,730
{\an2}拖拽公爵夫人
出港

2336
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,300
{\an8}and steal the other two
German tug boats

2337
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,300
{\an2}并偷走另外两个
德国拖船

2338
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,630
{\an8}that service the U-boats.

2339
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,630
{\an2}为U型潜艇提供服务。

2340
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,530
{\an8}And how are
we supposed to do that?

2341
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,530
{\an2}怎么样？
我们应该这样做吗？

2342
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:42,140
{\an8}Not only is she double-plated,
weighing twice as much,

2343
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:42,140
{\an2}她不仅是双盘，
重量是原来的两倍，

2344
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,940
{\an8}but you'd need a full crew
to move a ship that size.

2345
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,940
{\an2}但你需要一个完整的工作人员
移动那么大的船。

2346
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,680
{\an8}The tug boats are the crew.

2347
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,680
{\an2}拖船就是船员。

2348
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,340
{\an8}We tow the {\i1}Duchessa{\i}
out to the ocean

2349
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,340
{\an2}我们拖着公爵夫人号
出海

2350
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,720
{\an8}and, well, steal the lot.

2351
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,720
{\an2}然后，好吧，偷很多东西。

2352
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,310
{\an8}Then what?
We still can't sink them.

2353
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,310
{\an2}然后呢？
我们仍然无法击沉它们。

2354
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,790
{\an8}We don't need to.

2355
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,790
{\an2}我们不需要。

2356
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,380
{\an8}We sail
into international waters

2357
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,380
{\an2}我们扬帆起航
进入国际水域

2358
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,950
{\an8}and hand everything
over to the Navy.

2359
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,950
{\an2}并把一切都交给
交给海军。

2360
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,320
{\an8}They're following us anyway,

2361
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,320
{\an2}无论如何他们都在跟踪我们

2362
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,490
{\an8}so they'll be more than happy
to see us again.

2363
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,490
{\an2}所以他们会非常高兴
再次见到我们。

2364
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:03,030
{\an8}And what about the anchor?

2365
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:03,030
{\an2}那么锚呢？

2366
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,570
{\an8}Have you seen the size of it?

2367
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,570
{\an2}你见过它的大小吗？

2368
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:07,460
{\an8}If we're gonna
actually start to move her,

2369
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:07,460
{\an2}如果我们要
真正开始感动她，

2370
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,530
{\an8}their S-boats
will catch us in seconds.

2371
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,530
{\an2}他们的S艇
几秒钟内就会抓住我们。

2372
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,900
{\an8}Well, what are you going to do

2373
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,900
{\an2}好吧，你打算做什么

2374
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,040
{\an8}with all the explosives
you brought, Freddy?

2375
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,040
{\an2}和所有的炸药
你带来了吗，弗雷迪？

2376
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,910
{\an8}We'll use them
to blow the anchor.

2377
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,910
{\an2}我们将使用它们
起锚。

2378
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:18,240
{\an8}We'll rig the S-boats
so they can't follow,

2379
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:18,240
{\an2}我们将装备 S 艇
所以他们无法跟随，

2380
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,410
{\an8}rig the fuel reserve
that supplies the U-boats,

2381
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,410
{\an2}操纵燃料储备
为U型潜艇提供补给，

2382
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:24,180
{\an8}and then, well, blow the lot up.

2383
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:24,180
{\an2}然后，好吧，炸毁这一切。

2384
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,850
{\an8}That fuel explosion's
gonna bring

2385
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,850
{\an2}那次燃油爆炸
会带来

2386
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,420
{\an8}everyone and their mother
down to the harbor.

2387
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,420
{\an2}每个人和他们的母亲
下到港口。

2388
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,150
{\an8}We set the fuse,

2389
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,150
{\an2}我们设置保险丝，

2390
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:31,590
{\an8}so that the fuel dump blows
once we're outside the harbor.

2391
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:31,590
{\an2}以便燃油堆爆炸
一旦我们出了港口。

2392
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:34,090
{\an8}Then we sneak out quietly.

2393
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:34,090
{\an2}然后我们悄悄溜出去。

2394
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,690
{\an8}Not bad.

2395
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,690
{\an2}不错。

2396
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,000
{\an8}It's very greedy.

2397
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,000
{\an2}真是太贪心了。

2398
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:44,430
{\an8}- Well, I'm in.
-Well,

2399
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:44,430
{\an2}- 嗯，我进来了。
-出色地，

2400
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:47,770
{\an8}I'm not leaving until I have
a barrel full of Nazi hearts.

2401
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:47,770
{\an2}我不会离开，直到我完成为止
一桶装满纳粹之心。

2402
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:49,880
{\an8}I'll do whatever
you tell me to do, sir.

2403
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:49,880
{\an2}我会做任何事
你告诉我怎么做，先生。

2404
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,610
{\an8}Gentlemen,

2405
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,610
{\an2}先生们，

2406
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,220
{\an8}let's steal some boats.

2407
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,220
{\an2}让我们偷一些船吧。

2408
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:12,720
{\an8}Turns out she's double-plated,
so change of plans.

2409
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:12,720
{\an2}原来她是双盘，
所以改变计划。

2410
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:16,230
{\an8}We're going
to steal the boats instead.

2411
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:16,230
{\an2}本来打算
而是偷船。

2412
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,730
{\an8}Is that even possible?

2413
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,730
{\an2}这可能吗？

2414
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,730
{\an8}I'm not entirely sure.

2415
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,730
{\an2}我不太确定。

2416
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,110
{\an8}But if you're up for it,
so are we.

2417
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,110
{\an2}但如果你愿意的话
我们也是。

2418
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,440
{\an8}And you know what that means.

2419
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,440
{\an2}你知道这意味着什么。

2420
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,450
{\an8}A lot more blood
and a lot more sweat.

2421
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,450
{\an2}血多了很多
还有更多的汗水。

2422
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,150
{\an8}Hopefully not any of ours,
old boy.

2423
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,150
{\an2}希望不是我们任何人，
老男孩。

2424
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,320
{\an8}I don't think we can do this
without you, Billy.

2425
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,320
{\an2}我认为我们做不到
没有你，比利。

2426
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,170
{\an8}Well, I'm up for it if you are.

2427
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,170
{\an2}好吧，如果你愿意的话，我愿意。

2428
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,740
{\an8}I think we're gonna
need your tug.

2429
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,740
{\an2}我想我们会
需要你的拖船。

2430
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,850
{\an8}Haysey and I will
take a stroll along the harbor

2431
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,850
{\an2}海西和我会
沿着港口漫步

2432
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,750
{\an8}and take out
any soldiers still patrolling.

2433
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,750
{\an2}并取出
任何仍在巡逻的士兵。

2434
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,480
{\an8}Freddy will bring
his dinghy around

2435
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,480
{\an2}弗莱迪将带来
他的小艇在周围

2436
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:06,750
{\an8}and take care of the S-boats.

2437
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:06,750
{\an2}并照顾S艇。

2438
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,860
{\an8}We'll meet you by the tug boats.

2439
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,860
{\an2}我们将在拖船上与您会面。

2440
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:10,750
{\an8}And the {\i1}Duchessa?{\i}

2441
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:10,750
{\an2}公爵夫人呢？

2442
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,320
{\an8}That's Apple and me.

2443
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,320
{\an2}那是苹果和我。

2444
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,890
{\an8}We'll take care of any crew
and blow the anchor.

2445
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,890
{\an2}我们会照顾任何船员
并吹锚。

2446
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:16,090
{\an8}And destroy their comms.

2447
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:16,090
{\an2}并摧毁他们的通讯。

2448
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,060
{\an8}Not sure
what you'll meet on board.

2449
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,060
{\an2}没有把握
您将在船上遇到什么。

2450
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,530
{\an8}Take my top boy
and two more of my men.

2451
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,530
{\an2}带走我的顶级男孩
还有我的另外两个人。

2452
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,470
{\an8}Gentlemen, let's prepare.

2453
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,470
{\an2}先生们，让我们做好准备吧。

2454
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,810
{\an8\i1}♪ Oh, the shark, babe{\i}

2455
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,810

2465
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,970

2466
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:02,130
{\an8\i1}♪ You know

never a trace of red{\i}

2475
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:22,360
{\an2}♪ 所以从来没有，

2476
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,030
{\an8\i1}♪ On the sidewalk{\i}

2477
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,030
{\an2}♪ 在人行道上

2478
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,830
{\an8\i1}♪ On Sunday morning,

2479
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,830
{\an2}♪ 周日早上，

2480
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:31,860

{\an8}Not yet.

01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:48,080
{\an2}还没有。

2496
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,120
{\an8\i1}Mein Herr.{\i}

2497
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,120
{\an2}先生。

2498
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,190
{\an8}Haysey...

2499
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,190
{\an2}嘿...

2500
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,070
{\an8}Up there

2501
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,070
{\an2}在上面
在左边，先生。

2502
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,670
{\an8}Yes.

2503
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,670
{\an2}是的。

2504
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,910
{\an8}He made a crash!

2505
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,910
{\an2}他撞车了！

2506
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,330
{\an8}We could take that car, sir.
Save us some shoe leather.

2507
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,330
{\an2}我们可以乘坐那辆车，先生。
为我们节省一些鞋革。

2508
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,360
{\an8\i1}♪ Look out, old Macky is back ♪{\i}

{\an2}请提供论文。

2514
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,840
{\an8}- Commander.
- All good, Freddy?

2515
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,840
{\an2}- 指挥官。
- 一切都好吗，弗雷迪？

2516
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,240
{\an8}Charges are set to go

2517
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,240
{\an2}收费已定

2518
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,100
{\an8}once we're out
of the harbor, sir.

2519
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,100
{\an2}一旦我们出去
港口的，先生。

2520
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:36,440
{\an8}Let's carry on then.

2521
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:36,440
{\an2}那我们继续吧。

2522
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,120
{\an8}Did you enjoy your gift?

2523
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,120
{\an2}你喜欢你的礼物吗？

2524
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:54,990
{\an8}Mmm.

2525
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:54,990
{\an2}嗯。

2526
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,300
{\an8}I think now it's time

2527
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,300
{\an2}我想现在是时候了

2528
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:04,130
{\an8}that the fox shows his den
to the vixen.

2529
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:04,130
{\an2}狐狸露出了他的巢穴
到狐狸精。

2530
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:41,010
{\an8}Heron, why are
the lights still on?

2531
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:41,010
{\an2}苍鹭，为什么
灯还亮着吗？

2532
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,840
{\an8}I lit the room with oil lamps,

2533
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,840
{\an2}我用油灯照亮房间，

2534
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,550
{\an8}so they wouldn't notice
when the power went out.

2535
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,550
{\an2}所以他们不会注意到
当停电时。

2536
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,430
{\an8}- Look out!

2537
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,430
{\an2}- 小心！

2538
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,740
{\an8}Freddy, rig this 88,

2539
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,740
{\an2}弗雷迪，装备这 88，

2540
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,240
{\an8}then take the first tug
with Haysey.

2541
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,240
{\an2}然后进行第一次拖船
与海西。

2542
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,890
{\an8\i1}- Gute nacht.
- Guten abend.{\i}

2543
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,890
{\an2}- 晚安。

2544
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:02,460
{\an8\i1}Guten abend.{\i}

2545
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:02,460
{\an2}晚上好。

2546
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:29,620
{\an8}Terribly sorry, old boy.

2547
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:29,620
{\an2}非常抱歉，老男孩。

2548
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,190
{\an8}- Do you mind? I seem to...

2549
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,190
{\an2}- 你介意吗？我好像...

2550
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:33,560
{\an8}- ...have misplaced my knife.

2551
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:33,560
{\an2}- ...我的刀放错地方了。

2552
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,350
{\an8}- Bugger!

2553
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,350
{\an2}- 混蛋！

2554
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,570
{\an8}Thank you, Billy.

2555
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,570
{\an2}谢谢你，比利。

2556
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:58,270
{\an8}- Oh!

2557
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:58,270
{\an2}- 哦！

2558
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:56,130
{\an8}I hope that's
not your blood, Lassen.

2559
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:56,130
{\an2}我希望那是
不是你的血，拉森。

2560
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,900
{\an8}I hope so too.

2561
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,900
{\an2}我也这样希望。

2562
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,870
{\an8}Okay, boys, cast off.

2563
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,870
{\an2}好吧，孩子们，放弃吧。

2564
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:07,940
{\an8}Let's get this ship out of here.

2565
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:07,940
{\an2}我们让这艘船离开这里吧。

2566
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,320
{\an8}Go on. Go on...

2567
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,320
{\an2}继续。继续...

2568
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:21,250
{\an8}Go on!

2569
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:21,250
{\an2}继续！

2570
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:27,960
{\an8}There's three
more rooms just like this one.

2571
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:27,960
{\an2}有三个
还有更多像这个这样的房间。

2572
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:30,130
{\an8}That should stop the U-boats
for the next six months.

2573
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:30,130
{\an2}这应该能阻止U型潜艇
在接下来的六个月里。

2574
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:33,370
{\an8}Let's get this thing
towed out of here.

2575
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:33,370
{\an2}让我们得到这个东西
被拖离这里。

2576
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:35,000
{\an8}We are here, boys.

2577
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:35,000
{\an2}我们在这里，孩子们。

2578
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:36,680
{\an8}Quietly. Let's set a warning.

2579
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:36,680
{\an2}悄悄。让我们设置一个警告。

2580
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,010
{\an8}I need you to go
to the front of the boat

2581
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,010
{\an2}我需要你走
到船的前面

2582
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,980
{\an8}and attach the {\i1}Vulcan{\i}
to the {\i1}Duchessa,{\i}

2583
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,980
{\an2}并连接Vulcan
致公爵夫人，

2584
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,280
{\an8}Lassen and I
will head to the bridge.

2585
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,280
{\an2}拉森和我
将前往桥。

2586
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,150
{\an8}Okay.

2587
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,150
{\an2}好的。

2588
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,790
{\an8}Take the right side.

2589
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,790
{\an2}走右边。

2590
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:54,390
{\an8}And you, get up there
and get this thing started.

2591
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:54,390
{\an2}还有你，站起来
并开始这件事。

2592
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:08,000
{\an8}It's Gus.

2593
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:08,000
{\an2}是格斯。

2594
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:10,540
{\an8}Everyone's in place.

2595
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:10,540
{\an2}大家都就位了。

2596
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:14,980
{\an8}What,

2597
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:14,980
{\an2}什么，

2598
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,720
{\an8}you didn't actually think
it would work, did you?

2599
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,720
{\an2}你实际上并没有想到
它会起作用，是吗？

2600
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,880
{\an8}It was your plan.

2601
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,880
{\an2}这是你的计划。

2602
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:21,040
{\an8}Well, let's make sure

2603
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:21,040
{\an2}好吧，让我们确定一下

2604
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:22,950
{\an8}we keep our end of the bargain.

2605
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:22,950
{\an2}我们信守诺言。

2606
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:24,420
{\an8}Signal back and I'll heave off.

2607
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:24,420
{\an2}回信号，我就出发。

2608
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,790
{\an8}So, what happens now?

2609
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,790
{\an2}那么，现在会发生什么？

2610
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,430
{\an8}We wait for
the anchor chain to blow.

2611
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,430
{\an2}我们等待
锚链被吹。

2612
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,270
{\an8}When do
we expect that to happen?

2613
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,270
{\an2}什么时候
我们预计会发生这种情况吗？

2614
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,330
{\an8}- Shortly, I hope.

2615
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,330
{\an2}- 很快，我希望。

2616
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:36,630
{\an8}And then we're free to take her.

2617
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:36,630
{\an2}然后我们就可以带她去了。

2618
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:41,100
{\an8}However, the real race begins
once the fuel depot goes.

2619
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:41,100
{\an2}然而真正的比赛才开始
一旦燃料库消失。

2620
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,430
{\an8}Then we'll have every soldier
on the island turning up.

2621
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,430
{\an2}然后我们将拥有每一个士兵
在岛上出现。

2622
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,780
{\an8}We don't wanna
be around to witness that.

2623
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,780
{\an2}我们不想
见证这一点。

2624
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:50,650
{\an8}How long was that fuse

2625
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:50,650
{\an2}那个保险丝有多长

2626
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,750
{\an8}you attached
to the anchor chain?

2627
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,750
{\an2}你附加了
到锚链？

2628
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,220
{\an8}We'll find out soon enough.

2629
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,220
{\an2}我们很快就会知道。

2630
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,260
{\an8}Wait for it,
you're gonna catch the rope.

2631
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,260
{\an2}等等吧，
你会抓住绳子的。

2632
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:09,560
{\an8}Come on.

2633
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:09,560
{\an2}快点。

2634
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,950
{\an8}First domino falls.

2635
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,950
{\an2}第一张多米诺骨牌倒下。

2636
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,290
{\an8}- Hitch up the other line.
- Yes, boss.

2637
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,290
{\an2}- 搭上另一条线。
- 是的，老板。

2638
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:35,420
{\an8}Pick up the slack.

2639
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:35,420
{\an2}收拾残局。

2640
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,830
{\an8}They need to move her
before the fuel dump blows.

2641
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,830
{\an2}他们需要移动她
在燃油堆爆炸之前。

2642
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:42,890
{\an8}Heron, we need Marjorie.

2643
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:42,890
{\an2}海伦，我们需要玛乔丽。

2644
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,930
{\an8}Leave Marjorie to me.

2645
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,930
{\an2}把玛乔丽交给我吧。

2646
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:46,170
{\an8}We'll catch you up.

2647
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:46,170
{\an2}我们会追上你的。

2648
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,070
{\an8}Very good.

2649
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,070
{\an2}非常好。

2650
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:50,080
{\an8}Let's go!

2651
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:50,080
{\an2}我们走吧！

2652
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,950
{\an8}I have to say, {\i1}Fraulein,{\i}

2653
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,950
{\an2}我不得不说，小姐，

2654
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:39,650
{\an8}you were good.

2655
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:39,650
{\an2}你很好。

2656
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:42,650
{\an8}And you were sly.

2657
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:42,650
{\an2}而你很狡猾。

2658
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:45,560
{\an8}There are only
two types of people

2659
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:45,560
{\an2}只有
两种人

2660
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:47,660
{\an8}that are as sly as the fox.

2661
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:47,660
{\an2}像狐狸一样狡猾。

2662
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:49,660
{\an8}The German

2663
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:49,660
{\an2}德国人

2664
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,460
{\an8}and the Jew.

2665
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,460
{\an2}还有犹太人。

2666
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:59,540
{\an8}And you are not German.

2667
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:59,540
{\an2}而且你不是德国人。

2668
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:02,340
{\an8}I think now it's time...

2669
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:02,340
{\an2}我想现在是时候了...

2670
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,350
{\an8}- ...for a real party.

2671
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,350
{\an2}- ...真正的聚会。

2672
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:19,220
{\an8}That wasn't
supposed to happen yet.

2673
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:19,220
{\an2}那不是
应该会发生。

2674
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,100
{\an8}Shackle her!

2675
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,100
{\an2}束缚她！

2676
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,770
{\an8}And follow me.

2677
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,770
{\an2}并跟随我。

2678
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:32,180
{\an8}The harbor is under attack!

2679
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:32,180
{\an2}港口遭到攻击！

2680
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,530
{\an8}They're coming.

2681
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,530
{\an2}他们来了。

2682
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,910
{\an8}We need power on the engine.

2683
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,910
{\an2}我们需要为发动机提供动力。

2684
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,740
{\an8}- She's too heavy!
- Pick up the slack!

2685
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,740
{\an2}-她太重了！
- 收拾残局！

2686
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:20,050
{\an8}Wait...

2687
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:20,050
{\an2}等待...

2688
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:25,000
{\an8}She's not moving!

2689
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:25,000
{\an2}她没动！

2690
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:29,300
{\an8}Fire! Fire! Fire!

2691
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:29,300
{\an2}火！火！火！

2692
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,270
{\an8}Wait for it.

2693
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,270
{\an2}等等吧。

2694
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,220
{\an8}We need
more power on the engine.

2695
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,220
{\an2}我们需要
为发动机提供更多动力。

2696
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,690
{\an8}Give me more power! More power!

2697
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,690
{\an2}给我更多的力量！更多力量！

2698
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:58,590
{\an8}That's it, it's working!

2699
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:58,590
{\an2}就是这样，它正在工作！

2700
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:00,700
{\an8}- That's it!

2701
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:00,700
{\an2}- 就是这样！

2702
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,900
{\an8}Ready!

2703
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,900
{\an2}准备好！

2704
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:51,890
{\an8}-  Haysey!

2705
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:51,890
{\an2}- 嘿！

2706
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,710
{\an8}We're out of range now.

2707
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,710
{\an2}我们现在已经超出范围了。

2708
01:38:55,610 --> 01:38:57,120
{\an8}- I'm no expert.

2709
01:38:55,610 --> 01:38:57,120
{\an2}- 我不是专家。

2710
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:59,650
{\an8}But you've got a big old hole
in your shoulder, Haysey.

2711
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:59,650
{\an2}但你有一个大洞
在你的肩膀上，海西。

2712
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:49,400
{\an8}Captain,

2713
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:49,400
{\an2}队长，

2714
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,660
{\an8}would you explain to me
what's going on here?

2715
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,660
{\an2}你能向我解释一下吗
这里发生了什么？

2716
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,870
{\an8}The power is gone.

2717
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,870
{\an2}电源没了。

2718
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:57,300
{\an8}The fuel depot
has been sabotaged.

2719
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:57,300
{\an2}燃料库
已被破坏。

2720
01:39:57,410 --> 01:39:58,480
{\an8}And no one knows
what's happening.

2721
01:39:57,410 --> 01:39:58,480
{\an2}并且没有人知道
发生了什么。

2722
01:39:58,580 --> 01:39:59,680
{\an8}But this is your fault.

2723
01:39:58,580 --> 01:39:59,680
{\an2}但这是你的错。

2724
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:01,010
{\an8}Where is my ship?

2725
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:01,010
{\an2}我的船在哪里？

2726
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:04,540
{\an8}The {\i1}Duchessa,{\i} where did it go?

2727
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:04,540
{\an2}公爵夫人，它去哪儿了？

2728
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:06,810
{\an8}Someone's taken him
while you weren't looking.

2729
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:06,810
{\an2}有人带走了他
当你不看的时候。

2730
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:09,280
{\an8}You idiot!

2731
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:09,280
{\an2}你个傻冒！

2732
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,820
{\an8}You always have to say something

2733
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,820
{\an2}你总是必须说些什么

2734
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:12,650
{\an8}at the very wrong time.

2735
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:12,650
{\an2}在非常错误的时间。

2736
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,560
{\an8}There is never
a right time with you!

2737
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,560
{\an2}从来没有
和你一起度过一个合适的时光！

2738
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:18,900
{\an8}Your greed and perversion

2739
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:18,900
{\an2}你的贪婪和变态

2740
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,960
{\an8}has distracted you
from your duties.

2741
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,960
{\an2}分散了你的注意力
来自你的职责。

2742
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,730
{\an8}Now my harbor is destroyed.

2743
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,730
{\an2}现在我的港口被毁了。

2744
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:24,170
{\an8}And my ship is gone!

2745
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:24,170
{\an2}我的船也不见了！

2746
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:30,840
{\an8}And now you're gone too.
Thank you.

2747
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:30,840
{\an2}而现在你也走了。
谢谢。

2748
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,030
{\an8}Impressive.

2749
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,030
{\an2}感人的。

2750
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,270
{\an8}Sounds like
your detonators worked.

2751
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,270
{\an2}听上去像
你的雷管起作用了。

2752
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:43,610
{\an8\i1}Chapeau, mademoiselle.{\i}

2753
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:43,610
{\an2}脱帽致敬，小姐。

2754
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:46,940
{\an8}You play well.
You really are the vixen.

2755
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:46,940
{\an2}你打得很好。
你果然是狐狸精啊。

2756
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,080
{\an8}Am I?

2757
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,080
{\an2}我是吗？

2758
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:52,750
{\an8}Well, my hand's been revealed.

2759
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:52,750
{\an2}嗯，我的手已经露出来了。

2760
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,800
{\an8}So, what now?

2761
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,800
{\an2}所以现在怎么办？

2762
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:02,790
{\an8}Now, I possess your hand

2763
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:02,790
{\an2}现在，我握着你的手

2764
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:04,900
{\an8}and for everything
you have done to me,

2765
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:04,900
{\an2}和对于一切
你对我所做的事，

2766
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:09,640
{\an8}I will visit
a thousand fold upon you.

2767
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:09,640
{\an2}我会参观
千倍地压在你身上。

2768
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:17,940
{\an8}Yeah.

2769
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:17,940
{\an2}是的。

2770
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,120
{\an8}But no.

2771
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,120
{\an2}但不是。

2772
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:41,440
{\an8}- Lie down.

2773
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:41,440
{\an2}- 躺。

2774
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:48,140
{\an8}Gus, we can't wait much longer.

2775
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:48,140
{\an2}格斯，我们不能等太久了。

2776
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:52,850
{\an8}They're coming.

2777
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:52,850
{\an2}他们来了。

2778
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:54,480
{\an8}If we stay here,

2779
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:54,480
{\an2}如果我们留在这里，

2780
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,620
{\an8}we'll lose contact
with the others.

2781
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,620
{\an2}我们会失去联系
与其他人。

2782
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:58,590
{\an8}Hold fast, Billy.

2783
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:58,590
{\an2}坚持住，比利。

2784
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:01,220
{\an8}Heron has a way of surviving
and Marjorie,

2785
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:01,220
{\an2}苍鹭有一种生存之道
还有玛乔丽，

2786
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,990
{\an8}well... good luck with that.

2787
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,990
{\an2}好吧...祝你好运。

2788
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,060
{\an8}That's a patrol boat
coming towards us.

2789
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,060
{\an2}这是一艘巡逻艇
向我们走来。

2790
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,170
{\an8}- Gus, we need to leave. Now.

2791
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,170
{\an2}- 格斯，我们需要离开。现在。

2792
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,580
{\an8}Hold on...

2793
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,580
{\an2}坚持，稍等...

2794
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:33,020
{\an8}It's them.

2795
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:33,020
{\an2}是他们。

2796
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:35,860
{\an8}RH.

2797
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:35,860
{\an2}相对湿度。

2798
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,160
{\an8}- KB.
-Marjorie.

2799
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,160
{\an2}- KB。
-玛乔丽。

2800
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,430
{\an8}Overdressed and underdressed
at the same time.

2801
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,430
{\an2}穿得太过分和穿得太过分
同时。

2802
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:46,200
{\an8}Come on, let's get you
out of those shackles.

2803
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:46,200
{\an2}来吧，让我们来接你
摆脱那些束缚。

2804
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,980
{\an8}Come in, {\i1}Violet.{\i}

2805
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,980
{\an2}进来吧，紫罗兰。

2806
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:55,200
{\an8}Calling {\i1}H.M.S. Violet.{\i}

2807
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:55,200
{\an2}呼叫皇家海军紫罗兰号。

2808
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,040
{\an8\i1}Come in,{\i} Violet.

2809
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,040
{\an2}进来吧，紫罗兰。

2810
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,380
{\an8\i1}This is{\i} Maid Honor.

2811
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,380
{\an2}这是荣誉女仆。

2812
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,390
{\an8}Go ahead, {\i1}Maid Honor.{\i}

2813
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,390
{\an2}继续吧，荣誉女仆。

2814
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:03,380
{\an8}- Loudspeaker.

2815
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:03,380
{\an2}- 扬声器。

2816
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,950
{\an8\i1}Sorry to bother you
at this time of the night,{\i}

2817
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,950
{\an2}很抱歉打扰你

2818
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,650
{\an8}but we've found ourselves
with one or two items

2819
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,650
{\an2}但我们发现自己
与一两个项目

2820
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:07,520
{\an8}that might be
of interest to you.

2821
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:07,520
{\an2}那可能是
您感兴趣。

2822
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,590
{\an8\i1}Shall we rendezvous
for a handover?{\i}

2823
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,590
{\an2}我们可以约会吗

2824
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,660
{\an8}Get me Admiral Pound.

2825
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,660
{\an2}给我庞德上将。

2826
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:25,000
{\an8}- Yes?
{\i1}Sir,{\i}

2827
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:25,000
{\an2}- 是的？
先生，

2828
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,310
{\an8\i1}- good news and bad news.{\i}
- Yes, yes. Get to it.

2829
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,310
{\an2}- 好消息和坏消息。
- 是的是的。开始吧。

2830
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:29,040
{\an8\i1}Bad news, they didn't sink her.{\i}

2831
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:29,040
{\an2}坏消息，他们没有击沉她。

2832
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:30,910
{\an8\i1}Good news,{\i}

2833
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:30,910
{\an2}好消息，

2834
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:32,620
{\an8\i1}they stole her.{\i}

2835
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:32,620
{\an2}他们偷走了她。

2836
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:36,380
{\an8}Congratulations, Prime Minister.

2837
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:36,380
{\an2}恭喜你，首相。

2838
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:05,450
{\an8}Hold it there!

2839
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:05,450
{\an2}留在那里！

2840
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:08,020
{\an8}Commander.

2841
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:08,020

{\an8}You were ordered
by Admiral Pound

2843
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:09,580
{\an2}你被命令了

01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:46,620

{\an2}我不知道

2882

{\an2}殿下？

你应该看到这个。

01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:44,450
{\an8}No need to shout.

{\an2}无需喊叫。

2900
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:49,650
{\an8}Stand still!

2901
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:49,650
{\an2}站住！

2902
01:46:49,650 --> 01:46:51,380
{\an8}Any chance of a cup of tea?

2903
01:46:49,650 --> 01:46:51,380
{\an2}有机会喝杯茶吗？

2904
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:53,720
{\an8}You, back up to the wall.

2905
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:53,720
{\an2}你，背靠墙吧。

2906
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,960
{\an8}Off the cloth, moth.

2907
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,960
{\an2}掉布，飞蛾。

2908
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:57,290
{\an8}Stand straight!

2909
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:57,290
{\an2}站直！

2910
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,740
{\an8}Never before
have the senior Military

2911
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,740
{\an2}从未
拥有高级军事

2912
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,070
{\an8}and Navy Commanders
of this country

2913
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,070
{\an2}和海军指挥官
这个国家的

2914
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:14,780
{\an8}been so united
in their condemnation.

2915
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:14,780
{\an2}如此团结
在他们的谴责中。

2916
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:17,080
{\an8}It is their view

2917
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:17,080
{\an2}这是他们的观点

2918
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,840
{\an8}that the discipline

2919
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,840
{\an2}纪律

2920
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,720
{\an8}on which
our armed forces depends

2921
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,720
{\an2}其上
我们的武装部队取决于

2922
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:24,720
{\an8}has been undermined
by men serving no master

2923
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:24,720
{\an2}已被破坏
不为主人服务的人

2924
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,720
{\an8}but their own thirst
for blood, murder and mayhem.

2925
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,720
{\an2}但他们自己的渴求
流血、谋杀和混乱。

2926
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,560
{\an8}Men who disobeyed a direct order

2927
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,560
{\an2}不服从直接命令的人

2928
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,890
{\an8}from the Admiral
of the fleet himself,

2929
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,890
{\an2}来自海军上将
舰队本身，

2930
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:35,730
{\an8}and chose instead

2931
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:35,730
{\an2}并选择了

2932
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,430
{\an8}to trust the whim and intuition

2933
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,430
{\an2}相信突发奇想和直觉

2934
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:41,430
{\an8}of the man standing beside him.

2935
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:41,430
{\an2}站在他身边的那个男人。

2936
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:44,430
{\an8}How dare they.

2937
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:44,430
{\an2}他们怎么敢。

2938
01:47:47,110 --> 01:47:49,610
{\an8}When only this morning,

2939
01:47:47,110 --> 01:47:49,610
{\an2}就在今天早上，

2940
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:52,910
{\an8}the first American soldiers
arrived on British soil,

2941
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:52,910
{\an2}第一批美国士兵
抵达英国土地，

2942
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:54,180
{\an8}ready to stand
shoulder to shoulder

2943
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:54,180
{\an2}准备站立
并肩

2944
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:55,310
{\an8}with us in Europe.

2945
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:55,310
{\an2}和我们一起在欧洲。

2946
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:59,250
{\an8}Allies who risked death
crossing the North Atlantic,

2947
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:59,250
{\an2}冒着死亡危险的盟友
横渡北大西洋，

2948
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:02,630
{\an8}and only by some miracle

2949
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:02,630
{\an2}只有奇迹

2950
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:08,090
{\an8}found their crossing
untroubled by Nazi U-boats.

2951
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:08,090
{\an2}找到了他们的十字路口
不受纳粹潜艇的困扰。

2952
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:12,460
{\an8}A happy circumstance,
I might add,

2953
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:12,460
{\an2}幸福的境遇，
我可能会补充一点，

2954
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:16,170
{\an8}which cannot be accounted for,

2955
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:16,170
{\an2}无法解释的，

2956
01:48:16,270 --> 01:48:18,770
{\an8}but which has cleared the way
for the United States

2957
01:48:16,270 --> 01:48:18,770
{\an2}但这已经扫清了道路
对于美国

2958
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:20,770
{\an8}to enter the European war.

2959
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:20,770
{\an2}进入欧洲战争。

2960
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:22,480
{\an8}And for which I know

2961
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:22,480
{\an2}我知道为此

2962
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:26,280
{\an8}President Roosevelt
to be immeasurably grateful.

2963
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:26,280
{\an2}罗斯福总统
表示无限的感激。

2964
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:31,050
{\an8}But setting aside

2965
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:31,050
{\an2}但抛开

2966
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:34,390
{\an8}this stroke
of unexplained fortune,

2967
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:34,390
{\an2}这一划
无法解释的财富，

2968
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:37,560
{\an8}what is to be done
with this unruly company

2969
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:37,560
{\an2}什么是要做
和这个不守规矩的公司

2970
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:39,330
{\an8}who do not obey orders?

2971
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:39,330
{\an2}谁不服从命令？

2972
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,730
{\an8}Who seem to have formed

2973
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,730
{\an2}谁似乎已经形成

2974
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:44,630
{\an8}their own ministry
of ungentlemanly warfare.

2975
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:44,630
{\an2}他们自己的事工
不绅士的战争。

2976
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:51,200
{\an8}From now on, they work for me.

2977
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:51,200
{\an2}从现在开始，他们为我工作。
