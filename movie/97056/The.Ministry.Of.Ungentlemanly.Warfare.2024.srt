1
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:48,526
哦,瑞典。
Uh, Sweden.

2
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:53,764
我…我…瑞典语，但我会说一点英语。
I'm... I'm... Swedish but I speak a little English.

3
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:54,831
我们要上船了。
We're coming on board.

4
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,108
大家都欢迎。大家都欢迎。
All are welcome. All are welcome.

5
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:08,279
即使是小的。他也可以来。
Even the little one. He can come too.

6
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:10,749
受欢迎的。
Welcome.

7
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:18,086
你为什么在这里?
Why are you here?

8
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,921
只是一个小小的航海假期。
Just a little sailing holiday.

9
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,351
一个快乐的男孩之旅。
A jolly boys trip.

10
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:22,161
把手拿开。
Take your hands off.

11
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,166
论文?
Papers?

12
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:28,761
护照吗?
Passport?

13
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:33,128
给你。
Here you go.

14
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,970
船上还有其他人吗?
Any other people on the boat?

15
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,137
就我们两个。
Just the two of us.

16
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:45,613
不行。
Nein.

17
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:52,046
来吧，来吧，我们有很多吃的……把你的脏手拿开!
Come, come, we have lots to eat... Take your dirty hands off me!

18
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:54,149
后退!
Back off!

19
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:59,528
还有你，把手举起来!
And you, put your hands in the air!

20
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,811
噢!
Ooh!

21
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,241
你现在有麻烦了!
You're in trouble now!

22
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,172
你真是个淘气的孩子!
You've been a naughty boy!

23
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,444
我给你100法郎，让你杀了他。
I'll give you 100 francs to shoot him.

24
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:23,512
别开枪打我!
Don't shoot me!

25
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:28,685
他讨厌德国人。你真该杀了他。
He hates Germans. You should really shoot him.

26
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:32,259
我…我很抱歉。你太吓人了。
I... I'm sorry. You are very scary.

27
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:33,696
让他走跳板。
Make him walk the plank.

28
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,030
他喜欢木头。
He loves wood.

29
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:41,372
肮脏的醉鬼!
Dirty drunken animal!

30
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,334
罪名成立。
Guilty as charged.

31
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,459
我总是带一罐煤油来应付这种情况。
I always take a can of kerosene for just these sort of occasions.

32
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:11,967
已经有一段时间了，但上次我登船时有人嘲笑我，我给了他们选择的机会。
It's been a while, but the last time someone laughed at me when I boarded their vessel, I gave them the choice.

33
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:16,531
要么游到岸边，要么在燃烧的船上碰碰运气。
Either swim to shore or take their chances on a burning ship.

34
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:24,877
汉斯和我不知道他们会选择哪一个，是被水淹死还是被火烧死。
Hans and I wondered which option they'd choose, death by water or death by fire.

35
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:27,451
奇怪的是，他们两者都选了。
Oddly, they chose both.

36
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:49,341
他们一直等到最后一刻，等到头发都烧起来了，手指上的水泡都剥落了，才跳进水里，幻想着能上岸。
They waited until the very last moment, until their hair was on fire, and their blistered skin peeled from their fingers, before they immersed themselves in water in the vain hope of reaching shore.

37
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,904
其中一艘立刻沉没了。
One of them sank immediately and perished.

38
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:59,681
但令我们惊讶的是，那个大个子，他表现出了伟大的精神。
But to our amazement, the big one, he showed great spirit.

39
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:06,188
尽管所有的可能性... ...他费力地游到岸边。
In spite of all the odds... ... he painstakingly made it to shore.

40
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:16,467
我们跟着他，为他欢呼，并向他的后脑勺开了一枪来奖励他这一令人印象深刻的成就。
We followed and cheered him on and rewarded this impressive achievement with a bullet to the back of his head.

41
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,295
这不是很有趣吗?
Isn't that funny?

42
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:22,671
你为什么不笑?
Why aren't you laughing?

43
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,589
干得好，拉森。
Nice work, Lassen.

44
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,757
还有更多的来源。
There's more where that came from.

45
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:17,528
是的。
Yes.

46
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:28,363
啊…我不确定它是否有效，拉森。
Ah... Not sure it's working, Lassen.

47
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:31,366
船长看起来相当不安。
The captain looks rather agitated.

48
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,640
他们带着枪来了。
They're bringing their guns to bear.

49
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:44,912
他们很快就会找到射程的，长官。
They'll find their range soon, sir.

50
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:47,288
弗雷迪，我们该担心吗?
Freddy, should we be worried?

51
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:48,956
哦，我不这么认为，先生。
Oh, I don't think so, sir.

52
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,692
这是一个相当大的炸药，所以我放了一个相当大的引信。
It's a rather large explosive, so I set a rather large fuse.

53
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:56,294
我定位了化妆室的外面，所以当它爆炸的时候，它真的应该爆炸。
I located the outside of the powder room, so when it goes bang, it really should go bang.

54
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,968
靠近……应该马上就到了，伙计们。
Closer... Should be any second now, chaps.

55
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:08,836
弗雷迪?
Freddy?

56
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,410
干得好，弗雷德里克。
Good work, Frederick.

57
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,747
谢谢你，上尉。
Thank you, Captain.

58
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,955
现在，你能告诉我们在这里做什么吗，先生?
Now, any chance you can tell us what we're doing here, sir?

59
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:35,601
当希特勒和他的纳粹大军横扫他们前进的道路时，欧洲的战争仍在肆虐。
The war in Europe rages on as Hitler and his Nazi horde sweep aside all in their path.

60
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:45,879
波兰、比利时和现在的法国都落入了希特勒的法西斯政权之手，让英国背负着整个欧洲解放的最后希望。
Poland, Belgium and now France have all fallen to Hitler's fascist regime, leaving Britain holding up the final hopes of liberation for all of Europe.

61
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,416
来吧，布莱蒂，准备打架吧。
So, come on, Blighty, get ready for a fighty.

62
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,421
但我们不能单独行动。
But we cannot do it alone.

63
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:59,229
我们的美国兄弟从大西洋彼岸加入我们的任何希望都被德国的秘密武器u型潜艇所挫败。
And any hope for our American brothers to join us from across the Atlantic remains frustrated by Germany's secret weapon, the U-boat.

64
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,558
这些致命的小潜艇在北大西洋随意捕猎。
These deadly little submarines hunt at will in the North Atlantic.

65
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:13,906
u型潜艇在无人察觉的情况下，不分青红皂白地击沉了船只，无论是运载弹药、粮食还是从我们的同伴那里驶往大洋彼岸的平民。
Undetectable, the U-boat sinks ships indiscriminately, whether carrying munitions, provisions or civilians heading from our companions across the pond.

66
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:20,981
只要潜艇还统治着大西洋，美国勇敢的军队就不可能到达我们的海岸。
So long as the U-boats rule the Atlantic, it remains impossible for America's brave troops to reach our shores.

67
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:27,391
英国是被迫满足希特勒的计划，还是面临希特勒进攻的毁灭?
Will Britain be forced to appease Hitler's plans or face devastation from his offensive?

68
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:34,489
伦敦被烧得一片通红，上面的炸弹和下面的鱼雷将英国人碾碎。
London burns and her seas run red, as bombs from above and torpedoes from below grind the Brits down.

69
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:41,206
由于无法防御这些致命的u型潜艇，欧洲和平的希望似乎已荡然无存。
And with no defense against these lethal U-boats, it appears all hope may be lost for peace in Europe.

70
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:50,406
德国人用u型潜艇切断了我们的供应链，我们也切断了u型潜艇的供应链。
The Germans cut off our supply chain with U-boats, we cut off the supply chain to the U-boats.

71
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:54,648
通过我们的情报人员，我们找到了办法。
Through our intelligence agents, we've found a way.

72
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:13,704
希特勒的大西洋潜艇舰队的整个维修、修理和重新武装…由两艘纳粹拖船操纵还有一艘意大利补给船在费尔南多港。
The entire servicing, repairing, and rearming of Hitler's Atlantic U-boat fleet... is operated by two Nazi tug boats... and an Italian supply ship in Fernando Po.

73
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:18,673
我需要愿意去击沉那些船的人。
I need men who are willing to go and sink those ships.

74
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:22,044
为什么我们不空袭费尔南多波，把船炸沉呢?
Why don't we just air-raid Fernando Po and sink the ships?

75
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:30,784
因为狡猾的德国人，狡猾的德国人，把自己定位在西班牙殖民地。
Because crafty Germans, being crafty Germans, have positioned themselves in a Spanish colony.

76
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:33,356
费尔南多波是中立领土。
Fernando Po is neutral territory.

77
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:42,799
如果我们进攻那个殖民地，其他未被占领的欧洲国家就会加入纳粹，我们迟早会发现自己只穿着皮短裤煎着粉红色的大香肠。
If we attack that colony, the rest of unoccupied Europe will join the Nazis, and it's only a question of time before we find ourselves frying big pink sausages wearing nothing but lederhosen.

78
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:48,563
希特勒不按规则办事，我们也一样。
Hitler is not playing by the rules and neither are we.

79
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:53,975
这当然是一次未经批准，未经授权的非官方行动。
This will of course be an unsanctioned, unauthorized and unofficial mission.

80
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,947
如果他们被英国人抓住，就会被关进监狱。
If they're captured by the British, they'll be thrown in jail.

81
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,983
但如果纳粹找到他们…
But if the Nazis find them...

82
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:06,053
这是折磨和死亡。
it's torture and death.

83
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:15,260
也许我找到了合适的人选，但很不方便的是，他现在被陛下下令监禁。
Somewhat contentiously, I may have just the man, but rather inconveniently, he's currently incarcerated at His Majesty's pleasure.

84
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:20,595
我们也许不喜欢他的态度，但他很大胆，是个杀手，
We may not like his attitude, but he's bold, he's a killer,

85
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,170
他们会跟着他去任何地方。
and the men will follow him anywhere.

86
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:27,470
你确定这是个好主意吗?
Are we sure this is a good idea?

87
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,038
当然不是。
Of course we're not.

88
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:32,244
但我们走投无路了。
But we're desperate.

89
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,218
-让他进来。
- Send him in.

90
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,686
前进!
Forward!

91
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,857
站在那儿，少校。
Stand there, Major.

92
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:55,630
谢谢你，中士。
Thank you, Sergeant.

93
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:05,339
格斯·马奇·菲利普斯，我是中校…弗莱明。伊恩·弗莱明。
Gus March-Phillips, this is Lieutenant Commander... Fleming. Ian Fleming.

94
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,719
他以前在海军情报局工作，现在为我工作。
He used to be at Naval Intelligence, now he works for me.

95
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:12,754
我为什么在这里，先生?
Why am I here, M?

96
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,358
我有个任务想让你负责。
I have a mission I want you to lead.

97
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,496
你为什么问我，先生?
Why are you asking me, M?

98
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,698
喝杯茶吧，少校。
Help yourself to a cup of tea, Major.

99
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,847
我们都知道我…
We both know that I'm...

100
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:42,850
不太受政府欢迎。
not very popular with the administration.

101
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:47,990
他们觉得你没有吸引力的原因正是我觉得你有吸引力的原因。
The reason they find you unattractive is the very reason I find you attractive.

102
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:50,492
使命?
Mission?

103
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,154
操作邮政局长。
Operation Postmaster.

104
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:54,689
在北大西洋压制德国的u型潜艇。
To neutralize the German U-boats in the North Atlantic.

105
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,372
-你有什么计划?
- And, uh, what's the plan?

106
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:05,769
潜艇需要燃料和鱼雷。——哦。
The U-boats need - fuel and torpedoes. - Oh.

107
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:09,539
但它们也需要二氧化碳过滤器来过滤氧气。
But they also need carbon dioxide filters for oxygen.

108
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,277
没有它们，它们就不能潜水，也不能捕猎。
Without them, they can't dive and they can't hunt.

109
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,379
停留在表面上，它们已经过时了。
Stuck on the surface, they're obsolete.

110
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:20,522
目标?
Target?

111
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,387
奥斯塔公爵夫人。
The Duchessa d'Aosta.

112
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:24,526
她是一艘意大利船，德国人一直在用……
She's an Italian ship the Germans have been using...

113
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:36,036
…为整个舰队加油，重新武装并补充二氧化碳过滤器。
...to refuel, re-arm and replenish the CO2 filters for the entire fleet.

114
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:38,741
她藏在西非海岸。
She's hidden off the coast of West Africa.

115
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,379
一个叫费尔南多岛的小岛。
A small island called Fernando Po.

116
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,811
我们想让你把她沉下去。
We want you to, um, sink her.

117
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:51,819
你们要假扮渔民乘坐一艘拖网渔船沿着西海岸航行船上的炸药足以摧毁公爵夫人号。
You'll be posing as fishermen sailing down the west coast on board a trawler loaded with enough explosives to destroy the Duchessa.

118
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,219
这是赫伦探员和斯图尔特探员。
This is Agents Heron and Stewart.

119
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:57,023
他们会在岛上做卧底。
They'll be working undercover on the island.

120
00:12:57,023 --> 00:13:00,460
赫伦先生已经在那里站稳了脚跟，经营着各种业务。
Mr. Heron's already established there, running various businesses.

121
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:02,029
什么业务?
What businesses?

122
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,463
赌场酒吧，非法出口游戏。
A casino bar, and illegal exports game.

123
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,902
盈利?
Profitable?

124
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:09,840
-我做得很好。
- I do quite well.

125
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,404
高级纳粹分子是我最有价值的客户。
High-ranking Nazis are my most valued clients.

126
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:13,768
对你有好处。
Good for you.

127
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:21,416
斯图尔特小姐是一名演员兼歌手，在过去的两年里一直和我们一起训练。
Miss Stewart, an actress and singer, has been training with us for the last two years.

128
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,280
她会假扮成纽约来的黄金交易员。
She'll be posing as a gold trader from New York.

129
00:13:24,382 --> 00:13:28,120
她的任务是引诱并分散岛上指挥官海因里希·鲁尔的注意力。
Her mission is to seduce and distract the island's Commanding Officer Heinrich Luhr.

130
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:30,994
她很能干，而且有点上进心。
She's very capable and somewhat motivated.

131
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:33,860
动机是什么，先生?
Motivated how, sir?

132
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,867
我母亲是德国犹太人。
My mother's side were German Jews.

133
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,029
他们是第一个走的。
They were the first to go.

134
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,437
很抱歉听到这个消息。
Very sorry to hear that.

135
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:41,932
我相信你会康复的。
I'm sure you'll recover.

136
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:45,673
离纳粹转移行动还有44天。
We have 44 days before the Nazis move their operation.

137
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:46,801
我们再也找不到他们了。
We won't find them again.

138
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:53,442
如果我要这么做，我需要我自己的团队。
If I'm to do this, I'll need my own team.

139
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:55,612
你不会喜欢他们的。他们都…
You won't like them. They're all, uh...

140
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:00,087
疯了。
mad.

141
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,817
他们需要这样做。告诉我们他们的名字。
They'll need to be. Give us their names.

142
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:08,063
亨利·海耶斯。
Henry Hayes.

143
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:18,072
一个聪明的年轻爱尔兰人，他讨厌纳粹，因为他的哥哥，我的好朋友，在一艘u型潜艇击沉了他的拖网渔船后淹死了。
A smart, young Irishman who hates the Nazis because his older brother, who was a close friend of mine, drowned after a U-boat sank his fishing trawler.

144
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:21,072
从那以后，我一直把他置于我的庇护之下。
I've taken him under my wing ever since.

145
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:23,138
他狡猾、安静、老谋深算。
He's cunning, quiet and wily.

146
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:27,347
更重要的是，海耶斯是个出色的水手，我信任他。
More to the point, Hayes is a magnificent sailor and I trust him.

147
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:34,455
如果我们想弄沉一艘大船，我们需要"巴斯"蛙人弗雷迪。
If we're going to try and sink a large ship, we'll need Freddy "The Buzz" frogman.

148
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:37,492
他可以把双脚绑在一起游过海峡。
He can swim across the channel with his feet tied together.

149
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:43,097
无可否认，他是个纵火犯除非他在破坏什么东西，否则他就是个悲惨的人。
Admittedly, he's a convicted arsonist and a terrible misery unless he's destroying something.

150
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:45,497
但他很擅长炸东西。
But he's very good at blowing things up.

151
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,336
接下来，我们需要丹麦锤。
Next, we'll need the Danish hammer.

152
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:52,509
安德斯·拉森。
Anders Lassen.

153
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:55,511
从小就在他家的庄园里和熊搏斗，打麋鹿。
Grew up wrestling bears and hunting elk on his family estate.

154
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:58,848
他是拿着鲍伊刀和弓箭的传奇人物。
He's a legend with a Bowie knife and a bow and arrow.

155
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:03,679
在盖世太保将他的兄弟折磨致死后，他在18岁时离家出走，与纳粹作战。
He ran away at 18 to fight the Nazis after the Gestapo tortured his brother to death.

156
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,754
他放弃了切鱼片的游戏，转而开膛破肚。
He gave up filleting game for gutting Nazis.

157
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:10,187
然后他出现在我们的海岸，准备与我们并肩作战。
He then turned up on our shores ready to fight alongside us.

158
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:15,593
他是一条无法控制的疯狗，知道一百种创造性的杀人方法。
He is an uncontrollable mad dog who knows a hundred creative ways to kill a man.

159
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:21,401
最后，也是最重要的，我们需要杰弗里·阿普尔亚德。
And finally, and most importantly, we'll need Geoffrey Appleyard.

160
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,409
是的，我们就知道你会。
Yes, we thought you might.

161
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:28,741
所以我们派他去费尔南多·波进行侦察任务。
That's why we sent him on a reconnaissance mission to Fernando Po.

162
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,345
不幸的是，他一回来就被纳粹抓走了。
Unfortunately, the Nazis nabbed him on his return.

163
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:34,546
那就更有理由了。他知道我们需要知道的。
All the more reason. He knows what we need to know.

164
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:42,092
他是规划大师，幸存者大师，国际象棋大师和刀锋外科医生。
He's a master planner, a master survivor, a chess grand master and a surgeon with the blade.

165
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:51,926
我们在敦刻尔克的散兵坑里呆了两周，如果不是因为苹果，我今天可能还在那里。
We spent two weeks together in a Dunkirk foxhole and if it wasn't for Apple, I would still be there today.

166
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:54,929
没有苹果，就没有使命。
No Apple, no mission.

167
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,174
恐怕这是不可能的。
I'm afraid that's impossible.

168
00:15:57,174 --> 00:15:58,202
为什么?
Why?

169
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:03,006
因为他被拉帕尔马岛上的整个德国驻军关押着。
Because he's being held by an entire German garrison on La Palma.

170
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,483
拉帕尔马已经在路上了。
La Palma's on the way.

171
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:10,846
-这太疯狂了。-让我来操心吧。
- That's insanity. - You let me worry about that.

172
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:16,852
我必须给自己买一件那种外套。
I must get me one of those coats.

173
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:47,122
现在，你能告诉我们在这里做什么吗，先生?
Now, any chance you can tell us what we're doing here, sir?

174
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:49,288
把自己擦干，蛙人，我来告诉你。
Dry yourself off, frogman, and I'll tell you.

175
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:51,359
我们都被好奇心吞噬了，先生。
The curiosity is eating us all up, sir.

176
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,662
我为我的秘密道歉，伙计们。
I apologize for all the secrecy, chaps.

177
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:05,532
但这是一个未经批准的，非官方的，未经授权的任务。
But this is an unsanctioned, unofficial and unauthorized mission.

178
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,178
如果我们被英国人抓了，我们都会进监狱的。
If we're picked up by the Brits, we will all go to jail.

179
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:13,007
如果我们被德国人抓到，就会被折磨致死。
If we're picked up by the Germans, torture and death.

180
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,344
那就我们四个人了吗?
So, it's just the four of us then?

181
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:18,714
还有阿普尔亚德船长。
And Captain Appleyard.

182
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:21,650
他负责确保这些信息的安全。
He's responsible for securing this information.

183
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,929
然而，他遇到了一点麻烦。
He is, however, in a spot of bother.

184
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:27,765
他被德国人关押在拉帕尔马岛。
He is being held by the Germans on La Palma.

185
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:29,295
我们的首要任务是解救他。
Our first job is to liberate him.

186
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:30,935
-哦，就这些了，是吗?-不。
- Oh, so, that's all, is it? -No.

187
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:33,002
我们需要确认阿普尔亚德的情报。
We need to confirm Appleyard's intelligence.

188
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:37,299
所以我们说话的时候，还有两名探员正坐火车去费尔南多·波。
That's why there are two more agents on their way to Fernando Po by train, as we speak.

189
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,103
到底在做什么?
Doing what, exactly?

190
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:44,445
他们会确保那些飞船装满补给，所以一开始就值得炸掉。
They'll be ensuring that those ships are filled with supplies, so they're worth blowing up in the first place.

191
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:54,048
占领世界是一回事，但他们也必须占领厨房吗?
It's one thing taking over the world, but do they have to take over the kitchen too?

192
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:58,961
全是香肠，卷心菜和黑面包。
It's all sausage, cabbage and black bread.

193
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,791
你更喜欢谁?
Who would you have preferred?

194
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:04,627
法国人提供精致的古典风格。
The French offer the refined classical take.

195
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:10,537
Cote de boeuf, fromage, le beurre…-够了!
Cote de boeuf, fromage, le beurre... - ca suffit!

196
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:13,067
那意大利人那种质朴的自发性呢?
What about the rustic spontaneity of the Italians?

197
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:19,215
他们的油，扁面条，西红柿。
Their oils, the linguine, the tomatoes.

198
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:21,717
我会爬过扁面去拿意大利细面条。
I'd climb over the linguine to get to the fettucine.

199
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:23,916
但是青鸟。
But the cinghiale.

200
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:24,980
嗯。
Mmm.

201
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,785
你让我和野猪在一起。
You have me with the wild boar.

202
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:36,360
不过话又说回来，西班牙人也提供当地的海鲜饭和西班牙餐前小吃。
But then again, the Spanish offer the smorgasbord of the regional paella and tapas.

203
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,565
还有安达卢西亚的伊比利亚。
And Jamon Iberico Andalucia.

204
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:41,730
所以呢?
So?

205
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,103
我们正处于进退两难的境地。
We're between a rock and a hard place.

206
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:47,101
如果英国人赢了战争，我们就只能吃炸鱼薯条了。
If the Brits win the war, we're stuck with fish and chips.

207
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,315
如果德国人赢了战争，我们就只能吃这个菜单了。
If the Germans win the war, we're stuck with this menu.

208
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:54,515
所以呢?
So?

209
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:59,949
我们要香肠、卷心菜和黑面包。
We'll have the sausage, the cabbage - and the black bread please.

210
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,116
很好。谢谢。
Tres bien. Merci.

211
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,607
我们的情况吗?
Our situation?

212
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:22,972
稳定。
Steady.

213
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,719
稳定。
Steady.

214
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:42,156
现在。
Now.

215
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,005
嗯。
Mmm.

216
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,016
我累坏了。
I'm exhausted.

217
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:26,409
对不起,请。
Entschuldigung, bitte.

218
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:36,116
停止!
Halt!

219
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,271
有什么问题吗?
Is there a problem?

220
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,943
我自己能行，谢谢。
I can manage myself, thank you.

221
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:10,785
请允许我，斯图尔特小姐。
Allow me, Miss Stewart.

222
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:26,260
请允许我。
Allow me.

223
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:27,937
谢谢你！
Thank you.

224
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:31,600
祝健康!
Prost!

225
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,788
门。

226
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,988
锁着的。

227

正在努力。

229

239
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,155

240
00:22:57,155 --> 00:22:58,424
检查。

242

一万个二氧化碳过滤器。检查。
10,000 carbon dioxide filters. Check.

243
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,360
鹳鸟的消息结束了，长官。
End of message from Stork, sir.

244
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:07,837

00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,636
把车准备好。通知弗莱明。

248
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:15,578
我们收拾行李吧。
Let's pack it up.

249
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:20,115
如果金库里没有黄金，抢劫银行就没有意义了。
No point robbing the bank if there's no gold in the vault.

250
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:28,058
谢谢你！
Thank you.

251
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:31,187
知道世界上至少还有一位绅士，真是令人欣慰。
It's truly comforting to know there's at least one gentleman in the world.

252
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,094
啊!白痴!
Ah! Idiot!

253
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:38,634
美好的一天。
Good day.

254
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,454
香肠、卷心菜和黑面包。
Sausage, cabbage and black bread.

255
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:04,356
希特勒给了我们一个提议。
Hitler has made us an offer.

256
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:05,689
一个绥靖政策。
An appeasement.

257
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:10,825
但我们必须让我们的陆军下台，交出我们的海军，接受纳粹的统治。
But we must step down our army, surrender our Navy and accept Nazi rule.

258
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:16,565
否则，他承诺彻底摧毁不列颠及其帝国。
Otherwise, he promises total destruction of Britain and her empire.

259
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:20,610
我们最好的选择就是趁我们还能接受希特勒的交易。
Our best option is to take Hitler's deal while we can.

260
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:24,348
空军元帅表示同意。
The Air Marshal agrees.

261
00:24:24,348 --> 00:24:28,942
他有更多的炸弹，更多的人，更多的机器。
He has more bombs, more men, more machines.

262
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:30,981
我们活不了多久了。
We won't survive much longer.

263
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:36,021
你必须做出你唯一能凭良心做出的决定，首相。
You have to make the only decision you can make in good conscience, Prime Minister.

264
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,428
天啊，姑娘们。听听你们自己的声音。
Good God, girls. Listen to yourselves.

265
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:40,926
这不是绥靖，这是投降。
It's not appeasement, it's surrender.

266
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:43,425
你还是没意识到我们面对的是谁。
You still fail to realize who we're up against.

267
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:47,137
恕我直言，首相，是你没意识到。
With respect, Prime Minister, it's you who doesn't realize.

268
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:48,539
我们不能指望打败他。
We cannot hope to defeat him.

269
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:55,445
希特勒是邪恶的主要来源，是一个穷光蛋。
Hitler is the mainspring of evil, a guttersnipe.

270
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:57,445
这不是一个我们可以讨价还价的人。
This is not a man that we can negotiate with.

271
00:24:57,445 --> 00:24:59,383
我读过他的书，庞德上将。
I've read his book, Admiral Pound.

272
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:02,348
这个人是个恶毒的、受害的空想家。
The man is a vicious, victimized ideologue.

273
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,477
他不可信。
He cannot be trusted.

274
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:10,317
如果我认为我们可以通过投降来实现和平，我早就投降了。
If I thought that we could've achieved peace through surrendering, I'd have done it already.

275
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:12,660
我们需要让我们的国家不再挨饿。
We need to stop our country from starving.

276
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,458
我们每个月需要三百万吨物资才能横渡大西洋。
We need three million tons of supplies to cross the Atlantic every month.

277
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,828
我们现在损失了一半的潜艇攻击。
We are currently losing 50% of that to U-boat attacks.

278
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,570
另一个接受交易的理由。
Another reason to take the deal.

279
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,806
我还没说完，阿尔杰农，亲爱的。
I've not finished, Algernon, darling.

280
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:31,808
我们需要美国人，如果我们已经是失败的一方，他们永远不会参战。
We need the Americans, and they will never enter the war if we already appear to be a losing side.

281
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:36,418
结束与德国的敌对状态是摆脱这场混乱的最佳途径。
Ending hostilities with Germany is the best path out of this mess.

282
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,381
我们都同意，首相。
We are all in agreement, Prime Minister.

283
00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:41,515
谢谢你们，先生们。
Thank you, gentlemen.

284
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:47,197
是的，谢谢你们，先生们!
Yes, thank you, gentlemen!

285
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,236
弗莱明，这最好是个好消息。
M, Fleming, this better be good news.

286
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:58,207
首相，这是旅客清单，先生。
Prime Minister, we have the manifest here, sir.

287
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:03,875
已经证实公爵夫人号满载补给可以保证u型潜艇无限期作战。
It's been confirmed the Duchessa is fully laden with supplies to keep the U-boats operational indefinitely.

288
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:07,611
如果我们要击沉她，现在是时候了。
If we're going to sink her, now is the time.

289
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:09,015
他们在路上了。
They're on their way.

290
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:11,551
他们的机会呢?
And their chances?

291
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:14,548
如果有人能，那就是他们。
Well, if anyone can, they can.

292
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:22,798
但如果我们被发现，议会会罢免你。
But if we're discovered, parliament will remove you from office.

293
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,798
那我们最好确保不被人发现。
Well, we'd better make sure we're not discovered then.

294
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:33,375
我们从悬崖边取下来。
We'll take it from the cliffside.

295
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,705
这是一个85英尺高的陡坡。
It's an 85-foot sheer climb.

296
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:39,013
没有人会注意到一艘无害的小渔船。
No one should notice a small, innocuous fishing vessel.

297
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:43,552
我们在树林里埋伏，看看对手是谁，然后进行夜间突袭。
We'll set up in the woods and see what we're up against, then we'll go for a night raid.

298
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:46,250
悄悄溜进去，找到苹果，迅速出来。
Slip in quietly, find Apple, come out fast.

299
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,118
数字?
Numbers?

300
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,584
情报显示有50到60人的驻军。
Intelligence suggests a garrison of 50 to 60.

301
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:53,863
每个应该是15个。
That should be about 15 each.

302
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:57,431
拉森，别贪心。你确实很有名气。
Lassen, try not to be greedy. You do have a reputation.

303
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:59,899
我杀人的日子结束了。
My killing days are over.

304
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,136
我只是作为维和观察员来的。
I'm just here as a peacekeeping observer.

305
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:06,901
弗莱迪，装好装备，关掉武器。
Freddy, bag the kit, silence the weapons.

306
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:52,912
我们什么时候走?
When do we go?

307
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:54,758
0200.
0200.

308
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:59,653
先占领塔，然后进入无线电室，兵营，最后进入控制室……
Take the towers first, then move onto the radio room, barracks and end up in the control room...

309
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,459
-这是什么?
- What do we have here?

310
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,464
盖世太保。
Gestapo.

311
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:07,199
你怎么知道的?
How'd you know?

312
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:10,199
他们越坏，穿得越好。
The badder they are, the better they're dressed.

313
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:12,374
我真得去买一件那种外套。
I really must get me one of those coats.

314
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:13,975
他们一定是来找苹果的。
They must be here for Apple.

315
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:18,177
要么是严刑拷打，要么是撤离，长官。
It's either torture or, uh, extraction, sir.

316
00:28:18,177 --> 00:28:20,482
如果他们把他抓出来，苹果就完蛋了。
If they extract him, it'll be the end of Apple.

317
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:21,675
我们不会再见到他了。
We won't be seeing him again.

318
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:25,653
先生们，恐怕我们今晚没那么奢侈了。
I'm afraid, gentlemen, we're not going to have the luxury of night.

319
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:26,982
我们现在得进去了。
We're going to have to go in now.

320
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:41,202
那么，那里发生了什么?
So, what's happened there then?

321
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,603
看起来像是被箭填满了，海赛。
It looks like they've been plugged full of arrows, Haysey.

322
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:44,698
那么，箭头去哪了?
Well, where did the arrows go?

323
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:46,777
直接穿过它们。
Straight through them.

324
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:53,216
另一边还有两只。
There were two more round the other side.

325
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:54,415
他们现在在哪里?
Where are they now?

326
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:56,350
和这两个一样。
Same place as these two.

327
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,818
纳粹的天堂。
Nazi heaven.

328
00:28:57,818 --> 00:29:00,785
我们还有不到七分钟的时间，他们就会失手。
Well, we've got less than seven minutes before they're missed.

329
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:03,016
警报,狗。都不好。
Alarms, dogs. None of it good.

330
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:05,727
去引擎的卧底。
Go undercover of the engine.

331
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,556
只有发生爆炸的时候才会暴露。
Only break cover when things go bang.

332
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:12,569
我有个好主意，拉森。
I have a great idea, Lassen.

333
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:15,800
你为什么不自己去把那些德国人的箭射满?
Why don't you march off by yourself and fill those Germans full of arrows?

334
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:28,579
弗莱迪，拿剪刀帮他修栅栏。
Freddy, grab the scissors and help him with that fence.

335
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:29,649
啊,先生。
Aye, sir.

336
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,573
海西，你跟我来。我们向左走。
Haysey, you're with me. We go left.

337
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:54,403
弗雷迪，拉森，你们走右边。
Freddy, Lassen, you go right.

338
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:56,112
准备好靴子，先生们，祝你们胃口好。
Fill your boots, gentlemen, and bon appetit.

339
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,751
-塔上见。
- See you at the tower.

340
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:03,447
记住，先生们，要玩得开心。
And remember, gentlemen, try to have fun.

341
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:44,992
-到目前为止还好。
-  So far, so good.

342
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,692
-做得很好，Haysey。
- Doing rather well, Haysey.

343
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:47,892
哦，谢谢你，先生。
Oh, why thank you, sir.

344
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:06,981
非常好。
It's very good.

345
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:47,015
听起来隐身模式结束了。
Sounds like stealth mode's over.

346
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:48,090
Haysey,失望!
Haysey, down!

347
00:32:54,923 --> 00:32:56,257
——不行!不行!
- Nein! Nein!

348
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:29,851
我们认识吗?
Do we know each other?

349
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:32,557
——没有。
- No.

350
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,306
那是一颗心吗，拉森?
Is that a heart, Lassen?

351
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:52,811
为免生疑问。
For the avoidance of doubt.

352
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:55,115
苹果，老伙计。
Apple, old boy.

353
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:56,647
——格斯。-我看你们俩见过面。
- Gus. -I see you two have met.

354
00:33:57,687 --> 00:33:59,351
这是Haysey。
This is Haysey.

355
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,921
快乐,Haysey。-我也很高兴。
-Pleasure, Haysey. - Pleasure's mine.

356
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:03,225
我想你可能需要这些。
I thought you might need these.

357
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:06,090
你想得真周到。
Jolly thoughtful of you.

358
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:07,020
你们都找到他了吗?
You all find him?

359
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:09,858
哦,太好了。
Oh, goody.

360
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:13,103
妈的，你的乳头怎么了?
Bloody hell, what happened to your nipples?

361
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,868
你没事吧?
You all right?

362
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:22,277
你不能拔掉我的电源，对吧?电池还开着。
Couldn't unplug me, could you? Battery's still on.

363
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:44,751
你看到公爵夫人号和拖船了吗?
Did you see the Duchessa, the tug boats?

364
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:47,021
还有很多纳粹士兵。
And rather a lot of Nazi soldiers.

365
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:49,966
你的报告里怎么没写?
Why wasn't that in your report?

366
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:56,701
因为那些士兵，那些枪，还有那些s艇都是新的。
Because those soldiers and those guns, and those S-Boats are all new.

367
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:01,637
这比男孩们期望的要多得多。
That's a lot more than the boys are expecting.

368
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:03,811
一个月前，只有十几个机械师。
A month ago, it was a dozen mechanics.

369
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:04,944
六个喝醉的水手。
Six drunk sailors.

370
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:06,276
两个胖西班牙人。
Two fat Spaniards.

371
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:07,976
还有一个站在梨树上的纳粹。
And a Nazi in a pear tree.

372
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,453
我得说，我们需要更多的帮助。
I'd say, we're gonna need more help.

373
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:16,056
这件事交给我吧。
You leave that to me.

374
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:17,419
-当然。
- Of course.

375
00:36:20,196 --> 00:36:24,027
但现在…-…你得见见那个人。
-But right now... - ...you need to meet that man.

376
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:29,471
你的男人。你来这里的原因。
Your man. The reason you're here.

377
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,303
啊。
Ah.

378
00:36:31,303 --> 00:36:35,740
唯一比纳粹更坏的…是他。
The only thing worse than a Nazi... is him.

379
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:05,437
我很失望，苍鹭。
I'm very disappointed, Heron.

380
00:37:05,437 --> 00:37:10,341
在我的仓库里有16个箱子你还没有运到大陆。
There are 16 crates in my warehouse you have not yet shipped to the mainland.

381
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:12,479
不用担心，鲁尔先生。
No need to fret, Herr Luhr.

382
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,681
他们仍然会在约定的日期交货。
They'll still be delivered by the agreed date.

383
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:15,115
也许吧。
That may be.

384
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:17,445
但它们占用了宝贵的空间。
But they take up valuable space.

385
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:20,686
为此，我希望你的费用能大幅降低。
For this, I expect a significant reduction in your fee.

386
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:25,525
-我可以做5%... ...作为善意的表示。
-I can do 5%... ... as a gesture of goodwill.

387
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:29,064
二十。别浪费我宝贵的时间来讨价还价。
Twenty. And don't waste my precious time haggling.

388
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:34,535
严格来说，不应该减薪，因为还没有任何违约行为。
Well, strictly speaking, there should be no reductions, since there's not yet been any breach of contract.

389
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:40,035
五听起来很礼貌，二十听起来像个酸音，很刺耳。
Five is more than polite, 20 rings like a sour note, it jars.

390
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:42,539
罐子吗?
It jars?

391
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:45,246
我被指责不和谐吗?
Am I being accused of disharmony?

392
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,449
我认为这是对我个人的侮辱。
I take that as a personal affront.

393
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:54,081
我猜你不是秘书吧。
And I am supposing you are not the secretary.

394
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:57,157
斯图尔特小姐是我安排的联系人。
Miss Stewart is the contact I said I'd arrange.

395
00:37:57,157 --> 00:37:59,626
你的纽约黄金联系人?
Ah, your New York gold contact?

396
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:04,257
我告诉过你，我已经有了一个满意的安排。
I told you, I already have a satisfying arrangement.

397
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,063
请坐。
Have a seat.

398
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:07,331
谢谢你！
Thank you.

399
00:38:12,475 --> 00:38:14,267
我希望我不会让你失望。
Well, I hope I don't disappoint.

400
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,514
我不能就这次展示做决定。
I can't make a decision on this presentation.

401
00:38:20,245 --> 00:38:21,546
早期的天。
Early days.

402
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:25,520
好吧，如果早期的日子来得太快，季节随着猎人的月亮而变化。
Well, if early days do come too soon, and seasons change with a Hunter's Moon.

403
00:38:33,565 --> 00:38:34,331
嗯。
Hmm.

404
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:37,033
嗯。
Hmm.

405
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:41,701
我不得不说，苍鹭，尽管你有那么多缺点，但你确实有从帽子里变兔子的习惯。
I have to say, Heron, for all your flaws, you do have a habit of pulling rabbits from hats.

406
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:50,347
那么，你想转移多少金子-斯图尔特小姐?
So, how much gold do you wish to move, - Miss Stewart?

407
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:54,879
你能找到多少就有多少。
As much as you can find.

408
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:05,389
正如我之前提到的，我已经有了一个非常有利可图的安排。
As I mentioned before, I do already have a very profitable arrangement.

409
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:10,400
不管你怎么评论，我为自己能保持和谐而自豪。
And despite of your commentary, I pride myself on maintaining harmony.

410
00:39:11,695 --> 00:39:14,371
我为什么要招待你?
Now, why should I entertain you?

411
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:20,575
因为你会赚更多的钱，同时也会有很多乐趣。
Because you'll make more money and have lots of fun whilst doing so.

412
00:39:22,478 --> 00:39:25,811
如果我不守信，就别给我钱。
If I'm not good for my word, don't pay me.

413
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:42,828
布拉沃。
Bravo.

414
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:47,261
我会和我的人谈谈，然后我们会合。
I will talk to my people and then we'll rendezvous.

415
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:49,065
可爱。
Lovely.

416
00:39:53,475 --> 00:40:01,583
当狡猾的红猫在黎明吠叫，为了自己的快乐而杀人时，谁会分享猫偷来的食物呢?
When the sly red cat barks at dawn, and kills just for her pleasure, who shares the meal the cat did steal when both looked on in pleasure?

417
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:05,422
再会。
Auf wiedersehen.

418
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:54,296
这个谜语写得不错。
The riddle was a nice touch.

419
00:40:58,107 --> 00:40:59,273
钩子进去了。
The hook's in.

420
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:04,140
现在要小心怎么把他钓上来。
Now be careful how you reel him in.

421
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:17,923
孩子们到的时候，我会确保港口是空的。
I'll make sure the harbor's empty when the boys arrive.

422
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,360
你打算怎么做呢?
How are you going to do that?

423
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:23,363
我会在我的俱乐部办个派对。
I'll throw a party at my club.

424
00:41:23,363 --> 00:41:27,966
军官们的化装舞会和士兵们在码头举行的第二场晚会。
A costume party for the officers and a second party at the dock for the soldiers.

425
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:30,771
人们喜欢我的派对。
People like my parties.

426
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:33,136
除了鲁尔。
Everyone but Luhr.

427
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:35,707
那将是你的工作。
That will be your job.

428
00:41:35,707 --> 00:41:37,514
所有的老鼠都会跟着风笛手。
All the rats will follow the piper.

429
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,983
如果我没理解错的话，我们现在是在拉帕尔马。
So, if I understand correctly, we're currently here in La Palma.

430
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:54,493
我们将绕着德国控制的非洲航行到费尔南多波，它就在赤道以北，离西非海岸不远。
We'll sail around German-controlled Africa to Fernando Po, which is just north of the Equator, just off the West African coast.

431
00:41:54,493 --> 00:41:56,629
这是最短的路线吗?
So that's the shortest route?

432
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:58,199
是的，但我们不想剪短。
Yes, but we don't want to go shorter.

433
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:00,200
我们的首要任务是不让人看到。
Our priority is not to be seen.

434
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:02,769
你是说，再被人看见。
You mean, be seen again.

435
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:05,965
一遍吗?现在对我们有点草率了吗，古西?
Again? Getting a little sloppy on us now, Gussy?

436
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:07,341
已经发生冲突了吗?
Had a run-in already?

437
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:09,073
别管我们了，苹果，老伙计。
Never mind us, Apple, old boy.

438
00:42:10,014 --> 00:42:12,948
再提醒我一次你是怎么发现你的乳头粘在汽车电池上的。
Remind me again how you found your nipples attached to a car battery.

439
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:15,947
是的。不是我的错。
Yes. Wasn't my fault.

440
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:19,047
坏的情报。另外，看这部电影也是值得的。
Bad intelligence. Plus it was almost worth it to watch the heart-snatcher at work.

441
00:42:19,149 --> 00:42:21,054
与其说我是个斗士，不如说我是个爱人。
I'm better known as a lover than a fighter.

442
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:22,414
耶稣基督!
Jesus Christ!

443
00:42:22,517 --> 00:42:23,986
如果你就是这样吵架的，我可不想看到你爱。
If that's how you fight, I'd hate to see you love.

444
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:28,658
你不用担心，我配不上你这么漂亮。
You don't have to worry about that, you're too pretty for me.

445
00:42:28,658 --> 00:42:33,526
弗雷迪，另一方面…你得先抓住我。
Freddy, on the other hand... You'd have to catch me first.

446
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:35,572
我确实喜欢打猎。
I do love to hunt.

447
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:38,036
你会很幸运的。
You'd be lucky.

448
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:40,500
我真的很热。
I'm really getting quite hot.

449
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,343
不管怎样，我的建议是我们走这条更宽的路。
Anyway, my suggestion is that we take this wider route.

450
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:48,611
它显然更长，但应该避免与德国u型潜艇或英国军舰进行尴尬的对话。
It's obviously longer but it should avoid any awkward conversations with German U-boats or British warships.

451
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:51,544
视天气而定，我们应该在15天内到达。
Weather-dependent, we should make it there in 15 days.

452
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:53,819
同意了。
Agreed.

453
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:55,548
海西，你觉得你能做到吗?
Haysey, do you think you could manage that?

454
00:42:56,589 --> 00:42:57,620
交给我吧，先生。
Leave it to me, sir.

455
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:24,713
照我说的去做——再给我拿一杯来!
Just do as you're told - and get me another drink!

456
00:43:24,713 --> 00:43:25,913
队长,先生。
Captain, sir.

457
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:27,320
要我给你拿点吃的吗?
Can I get you something to eat?

458
00:43:27,422 --> 00:43:28,689
我可以……这边走。
May I... Come this way.

459
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,817
-把手拿开。
- Take your hands off me.

460
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:35,995
你知道吗，我喜欢你，费米。
You know, I like you, Femi.

461
00:43:38,065 --> 00:43:41,002
但你再碰我，你就进监狱。
But you touch me again and you're going to jail.

462
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:42,067
Femi。
Femi.

463
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:48,436
我来对付他。
I'll deal with him.

464
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:50,603
请照顾斯图尔特小姐。
Please take care of Miss Stewart.

465
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:55,480
你知道你需要什么吗，比尼亚上尉?
You know what you need, Captain Binea?

466
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:56,609
我知道我需要什么。
I know what I need.

467
00:43:57,386 --> 00:44:00,283
但你呢，里卡多?
But do you, Ricardo?

468
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:03,319
你需要再喝一杯。
You need another drink.

469
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:08,692
马蒂，好东西。
Marty, good stuff.

470
00:44:08,794 --> 00:44:12,092
里卡多，所以我才爱你。
Ricardo, that's why I love you.

471
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:13,494
-你懂的。
- You understand.

472
00:44:14,503 --> 00:44:15,628
我是费尔南多·波。
This is Fernando Po.

473
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:17,938
每个人的欢迎。
Everybody's welcome.

474
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:21,271
如果……每一个人。
Si... Everybody.

475
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:24,144
我觉得人太多了。
Too many body I think.

476
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,147
阿曼德?
Armando?

477
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:32,651
你和我们的新朋友闹翻了吗?
Have you fallen out with our new friends?

478
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:34,482
这不公平，里卡多。
It's not fair, Ricardo.

479
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,649
这是我的港湾。
This is my harbor.

480
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:39,328
我说了算。
I am in charge.

481
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:40,923
他们踩到你的脚趾了吗?
Are they stepping on your toes?

482
00:44:40,923 --> 00:44:42,089
他们不是踩，而是跺脚!
They don't step, they stamp!

483
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:44,099
他们什么也没告诉比尼亚船长。
They tell Captain Binea nothing.

484
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:50,567
现在我才听说公爵夫人要提前离开港口。
Only now do I hear the Duchessa is leaving the harbor early.

485
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,304
好吧，总算摆脱了。
Well, good riddance.

486
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:57,076
这个港口又将是你的了。
The harbor will be yours again.

487
00:44:59,342 --> 00:45:01,674
你什么时候才能摆脱那艘丑陋的船?
When will you be free of that ugly vessel?

488
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:03,676
三天前。
Three days earlier.

489
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,679
那我们应该再喝一杯。
Then we should have another drink.

490
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:11,926
庆祝。马蒂……请我们的港务长再来一杯。
To celebrate. Marty... Another round for our Harbor Master.

491
00:45:13,622 --> 00:45:17,160
上尉，你知道他们想搬到哪里吗?
So, Captain, do you know where they wish to relocate?

492
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:23,696
既不是猫也不是狗为了好玩而杀人，是雌狐，而不是别的。
It's neither cat nor dog that kills for fun, it's the vixen, not another.

493
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:32,612
只有两种动物以杀戮为乐，我漂亮的朋友，狐狸和他的人类兄弟。
There's only two that kill for fun, my pretty friend, the fox and his human brother.

494
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:51,724
我相信我已经解开了你的小谜题。
I believe I have resolved your little riddle.

495
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:56,203
帽子。你打得很好。
Chapeau. You play well.

496
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:05,738
说到狐狸，西47街的霍洛维茨和迈耶街。
Speaking of foxes, Horowitz and Meyer, West 47th Street.

497
00:46:06,614 --> 00:46:07,575
你听说过吗?
Have you heard of them?

498
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:09,918
我想我没有见过。
I don't believe I have, no.

499
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:48,781
他们是纽约中城最大的黄金交易商你还没听说过吗?
They're the largest gold traders in Midtown New York and you haven't heard of them?

500
00:46:49,988 --> 00:46:51,652
恐怕我没有，没有。
I'm afraid I haven't, no.

501
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,324
当然，我对霍洛维茨和海姆很熟悉。
I am familiar, of course, with Horowitz and Haim.

502
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:58,659
但是他们在城市的西边。
But they're in the west side of the city.

503
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:04,368
但话说回来，我相信你已经知道了，不是吗?
But then again, I'm sure you already knew that, didn't you?

504
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:15,379
我很好奇，你觉得和犹太人打交道怎么样?
I'm curious, how do you find dealing with the Jew?

505
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:18,684
哦,亲爱的。
Oh, dear.

506
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:21,616
我从一个陷阱里溜出来，却发现自己又掉进了另一个陷阱。
I've slipped from one snare only to find myself in another.

507
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,487
我该怎么说呢?
How shall I put this?

508
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:28,865
恐怕你们杰出的领袖误解了古贾胡达部落。
I fear your brilliant leader has mischaracterized the ancient tribe of Jahuda.

509
00:47:29,698 --> 00:47:39,832
他们不仅能在脖子上套着靴子的情况下存活3000年，而且还能在这种情况下繁荣发展……我怀疑这激起了他内心恶魔般的嫉妒。
Their ability to not only survive 3,000 years with a boot on their neck, but to prosper in spite of it... I suspect it inspired satanic jealousy within him.

510
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:47,048
总之，这位女士似乎抗议得太多了。
In conclusion, it looks as though the lady doth protest too much.

511
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:56,125
这个亵渎神明的蛋糕上还有樱桃吗，还是你吃完了?
Is there a cherry to go on this blasphemous cake, or have you finished?

512
00:48:00,694 --> 00:48:05,726
我必须承认，我不仅尊敬和钦佩犹太人……
I must confess, not only do I respect and admire the Jew...

513
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,702
我就是其中之一。
I am one.

514
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:32,093
开玩笑!
Kidding!

515
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:34,887
他们是贪婪的老鼠。
They're greedy rats.

516
00:48:38,898 --> 00:48:41,938
我想这可能是一段美好友谊的开始。
I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

517
00:48:43,907 --> 00:48:46,233
那我就开个派对庆祝一下。
Then I shall throw a party to celebrate.

518
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,205
我不喜欢聚会。
I don't care for parties.

519
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:51,745
哦,扫兴!每个人都喜欢聚会。
Oh, spoilsport! Everybody loves a party.

520
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:57,477
公爵夫人比我们预计的提前三天出发。
The Duchessa's leaving three days earlier than we thought.

521
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:00,913
如果我们不告诉伴娘，他们就来不及了。
If we don't tell the Maid Honor, they'll arrive too late.

522
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,828
传入的。
Incoming.

523
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:15,235
接触。
Contact.

524
00:49:16,865 --> 00:49:18,931
岛上的杰瑞人比预期的多。
More Jerries on the island than expected.

525
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,608
罐头腌牛肉提前三天从食品储藏室拿出来了。
Tin of corned beef's out of pantry three days early.

526
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,016
我就要这个了。
I'll take that.

527
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:30,118
这是机密，先生，只有M知道。
It's confidential, sir. For M only.

528
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:35,948
在提取时，它需要非常…长官，留言，长官。
When it comes to make the extraction, it needs to be a very... Sir. Message, sir.

529
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:43,197
岛上的杰瑞人比预期的多。
More Jerries on the island than expected.

530
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:47,960
腌牛肉提前三天从食品储藏室拿出来了。
Corned beef's out of the pantry three days early.

531
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:51,063
移动得更快。
Move faster.

532
00:49:51,063 --> 00:49:53,438
是的，但这片区域有越来越多的潜艇出没。
Yes, but there's increased U-boat sightings in the area.

533
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:54,967
先生。
Sir.

534
00:50:02,183 --> 00:50:03,184
任务还在继续。
The mission's still proceeding.

535
00:50:06,683 --> 00:50:09,818
所以岛上有更多的士兵而且船要提前离开?
So, there's more soldiers on the island and the boat's leaving earlier?

536
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:11,155
是的。
Yes.

537
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:12,627
那我们怎么才能走得更快呢?
Well, how are we meant to move faster?

538
00:50:12,627 --> 00:50:13,827
我们不能再快了。
We can't move faster.

539
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:15,623
我们已经尽可能快了。
We're going as fast as we can.

540
00:50:15,623 --> 00:50:17,660
这是一艘渔船，不是快艇。
This is a fishing boat, it's not a speedboat.

541
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:21,768
首相，公爵夫人12天后就要离开费尔南多堡了。
Prime Minister, the Duchessa's leaving Fernando Po in 12 days.

542
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,997
按照我们目前的时间表，他们会晚到三天。
On our current schedule, they'll arrive three days too late.

543
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:28,536
还能做到吗?
Can it still be done?

544
00:50:28,536 --> 00:50:31,080
我们还在等菲利普斯少校的回复。
We're still awaiting a response from Major Phillips.

545
00:50:33,214 --> 00:50:35,246
如果我们不能走得快一点，我们就走得短一点。
If we can't move faster, we'll go shorter.

546
00:50:35,246 --> 00:50:37,282
我们可以在12天内到达费尔南多波。
We can get to Fernando Po in 12 days.

547
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:38,480
等等，你说不能再短了。
Hold on, you said we couldn't go shorter.

548
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,285
不，我是说我们不想剪短。
No, I said we don't want to go shorter.

549
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:43,088
他说我们会被德国潜艇干掉。
He said we'll get mowed down by a U-boat.

550
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:46,457
或者更糟，被英国人抓走。
Or worse, picked up by the Brits.

551
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:48,359
他们的驱逐舰舰队正穿过那里。
Their armada of destroyers are crossing there.

552
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,924
我们真的要在u型潜艇上航行了。
We will literally be sailing over U-boats.

553
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,103
抱歉，伙计们，我们短一点。
Sorry, lads, we go shorter.

554
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,294
Drei, zwei, eins…
Drei, zwei, eins...

555
00:51:42,515 --> 00:51:49,917
先生们，就在我跟你们讲话的时候，伦敦再一次在纳粹的空袭下战栗。
Gentlemen, as I speak to you now, London once again shudders beneath a Nazi onslaught from the skies.

556
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,360
在这样的时刻，人们的心会被唤醒去履行职责。
And at such times, the hearts of men are stirred to duty.

557
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,396
但你们不是这样的人。
But you are not such men.

558
00:51:57,195 --> 00:52:01,669
你被选中不是因为你显赫的荣誉或崇高的理想。
You were not chosen for your conspicuous honor or high ideals.

559
00:52:01,669 --> 00:52:04,665
你被选中是因为你是最后的选择。
You were chosen because you are the last resort.

560
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:09,441
你被赋予的任务是前所未有的。
The mission you have been given is of a sort never before undertaken.

561
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:17,818
它需要无情的人，他们会毫不犹豫地屈服于战争公约。
It demands ruthless men, who will not hesitate to stoop beneath the conventions of war.

562
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,914
那些不洗手的人。
Men who do not keep clean hands.

563
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:23,555
像你这样的男人。
Men like you.

564
00:52:23,555 --> 00:52:27,956
-然而，他们仍然在自己不和谐的和谐中密谋。
- And yet, who still conspire in their own discordant harmony.

565
00:52:27,956 --> 00:52:32,759
他们知道，却不关心，他们可能永远不会回来。
Who know and yet do not care that they may never return.

566
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:42,134
你们勇往直前，不是为了荣誉，不是为了责任，也不是为了我，而是因为你们是不达目的誓不罢休的人。
And who press onward not for glory, or for duty, or for me, but because you are men who will not stop until it is done.

567
00:52:43,307 --> 00:52:44,609
祝成功,先生们。
Godspeed, gentlemen.

568
00:52:54,856 --> 00:53:00,152
嗯…家伙……那是一艘英国驱逐舰。
Uh... Chaps... That's a British destroyer.

569
00:53:03,832 --> 00:53:05,668
我们该走了。
We should move.

570
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,159
我们跑不掉的，长官。
We can't outrun that, sir.

571
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:13,165
我们见过他们，他们也见过我们。
Well, we've seen them, they've seen us.

572
00:53:19,412 --> 00:53:21,080
抓紧，荣誉侍女。
Hold fast, Maid Honor.

573
00:53:21,183 --> 00:53:22,882
我们正在准备登船派对。
We're preparing a boarding party.

574
00:53:22,984 --> 00:53:24,176
你好,船长!
Hello, Captain!

575
00:53:25,613 --> 00:53:27,514
没什么令人兴奋的。
Nothing exciting here.

576
00:53:27,616 --> 00:53:29,517
我们只是瑞典渔民。
We're just Swedish fishermen.

577
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,183
往前走，乔根森!
Step forward, Jorgensen!

578
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:34,327
乔根森，你是瑞典人。
Jorgensen, you're Swedish.

579
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:35,561
问问他们要去哪里，好吗?
Ask them where they're heading, would you?

580
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:42,096
不是你，拉森。
Not you, Lassen.

581
00:53:42,198 --> 00:53:43,195
嗯…
Uh...

582
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,243
我想听马奇-菲利普斯试一试。
I want to hear March-Phillips have a go.

583
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:49,069
啊。
Ah.

584
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,881
很好。
Fair enough.

585
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:55,113
游戏结束了，指挥官。
Game's up, Commander.

586
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:56,685
不能责怪一个女孩的努力。
Can't blame a girl for trying.

587
00:53:56,685 --> 00:53:58,110
干得好，少校。
Good effort, Major.

588
00:53:58,212 --> 00:54:00,284
但恐怕你得跟我们一起走了。
But I'm afraid you are going to have to come with us.

589
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:03,748
请问我们是在谁的授权下被伏击的?
May I ask under whose authority we've been waylaid?

590
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,217
奉庞德将军之命。
On the orders of Admiral Pound.

591
00:54:10,197 --> 00:54:11,226
中尉。
First Lieutenant.

592
00:54:11,226 --> 00:54:17,532
你在国际水域从事未经批准的犯罪活动。
You are pursuing an unsanctioned criminal enterprise in international waters.

593
00:54:17,532 --> 00:54:19,570
你会引起混乱的。
You're going to cause an upset.

594
00:54:19,672 --> 00:54:23,142
我觉得我们有点过气了，指挥官。
I think we're a little past upset, Commander.

595
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:24,671
史蒂文斯，你有什么发现?
Stevens, what have you got?

596
00:54:24,671 --> 00:54:25,809
我有个提示，先生。
I had a ping, sir.

597
00:54:26,883 --> 00:54:33,317
这个贪婪的小纳粹不会满足于占领大部分欧洲，他要的是我们自己的绿色和宜人的土地。
The greedy little Nazi won't be satisfied with holding most of Europe, he's after our own green and pleasant land.

598
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:38,256
谢天谢地，你带着你的小木船和五人大军来了。
Well, thank God you're here with your little wooden battleship and your five-man army.

599
00:54:38,256 --> 00:54:41,161
- u艇，方位273。
- U-boat, bearing 273.

600
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:42,322
—设置告警。

601
00:54:42,424 --> 00:54:43,892
船上来。
Come aboard.

602
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:45,798
潜艇靠近。右舷，长官。
U-boat approaching. Starboard side, sir.

603
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:47,795
战斗站!
Battle stations!

604
00:54:47,897 --> 00:54:52,900
少校，如果你知道什么对你有好处，你就回家吧。-很好，指挥官。
Major, if you know what's good for you, - you'll head home. - Very good, Commander.

605
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,240
海茜，尽快带我们离开鱼雷磁铁。
Haysey, get us away from that torpedo magnet as quickly as possible.

606
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,703
是，长官，苹果，到船尾去。
Aye, sir. Apple, man the stern.

607
00:54:57,703 --> 00:54:59,247
弗雷迪，在主帆上。
Freddy, on the main sail.

608
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:01,540
拉森到船头去。解开那个站!
Lassen to the bow, now. Untie that station!

609
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,917
看不见你。
Aye.

610
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:05,385
快点，伙计们!
Quickly now, lads!

611
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,488
帮我们拉起前帆，好吗，孩子们?
Hoist that foresail for us, will you, boys?

612
00:55:09,157 --> 00:55:10,590
主帆准备拉起!
Main sail ready to haul!

613
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:17,423
好了，弗雷迪，扬起主帆!
All right, Freddy, now raise that main sail!

614
00:55:17,423 --> 00:55:18,761
看不见你。
Aye.

615
00:55:18,761 --> 00:55:20,166
报告听起来。
-Report sounding.

616
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:21,667
其163年。
-Bearing 163.

617
00:55:30,611 --> 00:55:33,211
拉森，修整主帆，然后系上!
Lassen, trim the main sail and then tie it off!

618
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:34,614
你怎么能指望好呢?
How do you expect good?

619
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:37,576
报告听起来。
Report sounding.

620
00:55:37,576 --> 00:55:39,286
轴承115。
Bearing 115.

621
00:55:39,286 --> 00:55:40,381
-发射深水炸弹。
-Fire depth charges.

622
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,489
这就是你的人，能把事情搞定吗?
So, this is your man that gets things done?

623
00:56:17,489 --> 00:56:20,352
他叫坎普·比利……以K开头。
His name is Kamp Billy... with a K.

624
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:25,027
他上的是英国寄宿学校?
And he went to an English boarding school?

625
00:56:26,502 --> 00:56:32,364
不是普通的寄宿学校。他上的是伊顿寄宿学校。
Not just any boarding school. He went to Eton, the boarding school.

626
00:56:33,842 --> 00:56:34,872
对吧……
Right...

627
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:39,679
那他在这里做什么?
Then what's he doing here?

628
00:56:40,246 --> 00:56:41,840
他是个王子。
He's a prince.

629
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,285
到底是哪方面的王子?
A prince of what, exactly?

630
00:56:44,387 --> 00:56:47,222
-费尔南多王子!
- The Prince of Fernando Po!

631
00:56:47,222 --> 00:56:50,382
这么说，他既是海盗又是贵族?
So, he's part pirate, part aristocrat?

632
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:53,458
别致。
Chic.

633
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,387
他也是我们解决方案的一部分。
He's also a part of our solution.

634
00:56:57,767 --> 00:56:59,031
RH。
RH.

635
00:56:59,865 --> 00:57:00,964
KB。
KB.

636
00:57:01,663 --> 00:57:02,902
他回来了。
He's back in town.

637
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:03,769
首席。
Chief.

638
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:14,406
好像你总是带着礼物来。
Seems like you always come bearing gifts.

639
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:17,911
她是给我的吗?
Is she for me?

640
00:57:18,013 --> 00:57:19,411
-祝你好运。
- Good luck with that.

641
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:24,090
我不适合你，但这些是。
I'm not for you, but these are.

642
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,426
嗯。好东西。美味的。
Mmm. Goodies. Yummy.

643
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:30,422
-正面…——首席。
-  Ade... - Chief.

644
00:57:31,794 --> 00:57:32,859
加油！加油。
Come on, come on.

645
00:57:36,434 --> 00:57:37,836
有人很有品味。
Someone has taste.

646
00:57:39,075 --> 00:57:40,734
比母鸡的牙齿还稀有。
Rarer than hens' teeth.

647
00:57:40,734 --> 00:57:49,548
好吧，RH告诉我，KB是唯一一个在完成任务时可以交谈的人。
Well, RH tells me that KB is the only man to talk to when it comes to getting things done.

648
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:53,621
为什么我感觉自己从捕食者变成了猎物?
Why do I feel like I've gone from being - the predator to the prey?

649
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:02,958
不错的入场，小姐。
Quite an entrance, young lady.

650
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,832
条件是我们要取样……现在。
It's on the condition that we sample them... now.

651
00:58:10,271 --> 00:58:11,730
艾德，摆好桌子。
Ade, set the table.

652
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,800
首席。
Chief.

653
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:16,911
然后公爵说:“把它推进去，直到它停下来!”
And then the Duke said, "Push it in till it stops!"

654
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:25,180
你真是个厉害的武器。
You are quite the weapon.

655
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:29,052
我是对的，我是猎物。
I was right, I was the prey.

656
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,762
我会帮你，因为我不喜欢纳粹。
I'll help you because I don't like Nazis.

657
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,796
不是因为他们是纳粹，而是因为他们是笨蛋。
Not because they're Nazis but because they're gauche.

658
00:58:38,796 --> 00:58:42,329
我会给你一艘船和12个最好的人，包括你的手下。
I'll give you a tug and 12 of my best men, including yours truly.

659
00:58:43,936 --> 00:58:46,834
但如果我帮你，谁来帮我?
But if I'm gonna help you, who's gonna help me?

660
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:48,742
因为你不是士兵，RH。
Because you're not a soldier, RH.

661
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:52,306
不，但她是。
No, but she is.

662
00:58:55,548 --> 00:58:57,014
她会射得比你的伴郎还快。
She'll outshoot your best man.

663
00:59:34,188 --> 00:59:34,953
我告诉过你。
I told you.

664
00:59:38,753 --> 00:59:40,293
——不!——不!
- No! - No!

665
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:43,962
鹳交付。检查。
Stork delivery. Check.

666
00:59:45,033 --> 00:59:46,299
检查。
Check.

667
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:47,966
二十三岁男孩。检查。
Twenty-three boys. Check.

668
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,639
-送鹤。
- Stork delivery.

669
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:56,240
二十三岁男孩。
Twenty-three boys.

670
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:59,680
17岁的女孩。
Seventeen girls.

671
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,882
集合地点在费尔南多堡外20公里处。
Meeting point 20 kilometers outside Fernando Po.

672
01:00:04,452 --> 01:00:05,247
和苍鹭的会合。
The rendezvous with Heron.

673
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:07,715
你能把我们送到那里吗?
Can you get us there?

674
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:11,291
如果天气好的话，我可以，先生。
If the weather holds, I can, sir.

675
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:30,305
我赌20英镑，这事不会有好结果。
Twenty quid says this doesn't end well.

676
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:32,175
为谁?
For who?

677
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:34,276
对他们来说。
For them.

678
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:36,608
你不能把赌注压在自己身上，海赛。这是假球。
You can't bet on yourself, Haysey. That's match-fixing.

679
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:39,611
我们开始吧。
Let's do it.

680
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:42,256
苍鹭，太久没见了。
Heron, it's been too long.

681
01:00:42,256 --> 01:00:44,090
很高兴见到你，格斯。
Good to see you, Gus.

682
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,188
苹果。
Apple.

683
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:49,665
这是坎普·比利，费尔南多岛的王子。
This is Kamp Billy, the Prince of Fernando Po.

684
01:00:50,628 --> 01:00:51,933
殿下。
Your Highness.

685
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:53,427
他同意帮助我们。
He's agreed to help us.

686
01:00:54,731 --> 01:01:01,071
原谅我，但是……我有种奇怪的感觉，好像我们以前见过面。
Forgive me, but... I have a peculiar feeling that we've met before.

687
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:04,744
我经常听到这样的话。我去过很多地方。
I get that a lot. I'm extremely well-traveled.

688
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,144
不,不。这是一种特殊的感觉。
No, no. It's a particular sense.

689
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:13,317
我想你不打板球，是吗?
I don't suppose you played cricket, did you?

690
01:01:15,523 --> 01:01:18,192
队长伊顿。21年到22年。
Captained Eton. '21 to '22.

691
01:01:18,294 --> 01:01:20,526
我就知道我认得你的脸!
I knew I knew your face!

692
01:01:20,629 --> 01:01:22,528
就在奖杯柜旁边。
Right next to the trophy cabinet.

693
01:01:22,631 --> 01:01:25,298
一幅八英尺高的巨幅肖像。
An eight-foot-tall huge portrait.

694
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:28,203
是的，正是这样!
Yes, exactly that!

695
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:31,162
一只眼睛盯着边界... ...一只眼睛盯着酒吧。
One eye on the boundary... ...one eye on the pub.

696
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:32,738
很高兴你能上船。
Bloody glad to have you aboard.

697
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,336
真高兴能来，老伙计。
Bloody good to be here, old boy.

698
01:01:35,035 --> 01:01:38,809
这些纳粹分子让人讨厌，我受够了。
I'm very bored with these Nazis making a nuisance of themselves.

699
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:40,346
我是说，这对生意来说很糟糕。
I mean, it's terrible for business.

700
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:45,353
我很乐意帮你把他们揍得鼻青脸肿。
I'm only too pleased to help you serve them a bloody nose.

701
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:47,145
这是一种值得称赞的态度。
That's a commendable attitude.

702
01:01:47,145 --> 01:01:48,923
你的计划是什么?
So, what's your plan?

703
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:50,055
苹果。
Apple.

704
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:54,189
我们要击沉公爵夫人号，还有两艘拖船。
We're going to sink the Duchessa, plus the two tugs.

705
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:56,360
摧毁希特勒在大西洋的u型潜艇舰队
Crippling Hitler's Atlantic fleet of U-boats.

706
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,895
很好。
Very good.

707
01:01:57,997 --> 01:02:01,833
问题是，我们的老朋友纳粹可没这么简单。
The thing is, our old friends the Nazis aren't making it the easiest.

708
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,067
我们寡不敌众。
We're outnumbered two hundred to five.

709
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,741
这里的士兵比我们预计的要多。
There's a few more soldiers than we anticipated.

710
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:10,207
我觉得我们得再找几个壮汉了。
I think that we're gonna have to find ourselves a few more strapping lads.

711
01:02:11,047 --> 01:02:12,278
正面……
Ade...

712
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:23,715
对吧……
Right...

713
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:28,896
是的，我想可以了。
Yes, I think that will do.

714
01:02:30,534 --> 01:02:32,864
我们带了武器，如果你需要的话。
We brought some weapons if you need.

715
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:35,059
你拿着那些。我们带了我们自己的。
You hold onto those. We brought our own.

716
01:02:37,938 --> 01:02:40,275
Oyah !让他们看看铁器!
Oyah! Show them the iron!

717
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:44,942
太不可思议了。
Marvelous.

718
01:02:44,942 --> 01:02:48,880
你知道公爵夫人号离港口有200多英尺吧?
You do know the Duchessa is more than 200 feet from the harbor side?

719
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,484
她就在聚光灯下。
And she's in full glare of the lights.

720
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:55,480
如果不引起不必要的注意，她可不容易沉没。
She's not gonna be easy to sink without attracting unwanted attention.

721
01:02:55,582 --> 01:03:04,092
是的。这就是为什么赫伦会在我们划过去，在船体上装炸药之前，先放一颗炸弹来灭灯。
Yes. That's why Heron will plant a bomb to blow the lights, before we paddle in and rig the hull with explosives.

722
01:03:04,194 --> 01:03:07,768
等炸药引爆，我们就回家了。
By the time the explosives detonate, we'll be heading home.

723
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,933
如果按我的方式来，一枪都不会开。
If I had it my way, a shot'll never be fired.

724
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:12,505
你多久能按自己的方式来一次?
And how often do you have it your way?

725
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:14,506
那得看你问谁了，老伙计。
Depends on who you ask, old boy.

726
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:19,274
先生们……-正面。——首席。
Gentlemen... - Ade. - Chief.

727
01:03:19,376 --> 01:03:21,342
-让人准备好。
- Prepare the men.

728
01:03:21,445 --> 01:03:23,412
你准备好了就给我二十块，弗雷迪。
I'll take that 20 whenever you're ready, Freddy.

729
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:43,795
公爵夫人明早就会走。
The Duchessa will be gone by the morning.

730
01:03:45,004 --> 01:03:46,369
-你能做到吗?
- Can you manage that?

731
01:03:48,478 --> 01:03:50,802
这是两根电线和一个滴答声。
It's two wires and a tick-tock.

732
01:03:52,107 --> 01:03:53,508
我相信我能应付。
I'm sure I can cope.

733
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:57,182
你该担心的不是我。
It's not me you should be worried about.

734
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:01,813
我从来没带纳粹参加过派对。
I've never taken a Nazi to a party.

735
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:07,621
别去他的派对就行了。
Just don't end up at one of his parties.

736
01:04:11,698 --> 01:04:12,824
别为我担心。
Don't worry about me.

737
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,904
我要办自己的小派对。
I'm gonna have my own little party.

738
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,142
为孩子们干杯，为陛下的政府干杯。
Drink for the boys, on His Majesty's government.

739
01:04:28,047 --> 01:04:33,321
一般来说，我会咬掉你的手，因为大家都知道我很喜欢一英镑纸币。
Ordinarily, I'd bite your hand off, as I have been known to love a pound note.

740
01:04:37,152 --> 01:04:38,223
但这一次，
But on this occasion,

741
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:41,853
饮料我请。
the drinks are on me.

742
01:04:43,232 --> 01:04:50,001
然而，如果国王陛下的政府颁发头衔……你已经是王子了，老伙计。
However, if His Majesty's government was handing out titles... You're already a prince, old boy.

743
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:56,241
有费尔南多王子，但是……王国的骑士有一定的古老意义。
There's Prince of Fernando Po, but... a Knight of the Realm has a certain antiquity to it.

744
01:04:58,877 --> 01:05:01,114
起立，坎普·比利爵士。
Arise, Sir Kamp Billy.

745
01:05:03,585 --> 01:05:04,876
你是个好人，格斯。
You're a good man, Gus.

746
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:06,878
祝你好运，比利。
Good luck, Billy.

747
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,725
你好!
Hola!

748
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:21,970
好极了，伙计们!
Buenas tardes, companeros!

749
01:06:59,392 --> 01:07:00,992
先生，有客人来了。
My Herr, you have a visitor.

750
01:07:04,373 --> 01:07:05,832
哈!
Ta-da!

751
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:13,004
克利奥帕特拉需要她的凯撒。
Cleopatra needs her Caesar.

752
01:07:13,548 --> 01:07:14,577
把它穿上。
Put it on.

753
01:07:18,277 --> 01:07:19,318
谢谢你，蒂莫西。
Thank you, Timothy.

754
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,188
1秒。
One second.

755
01:07:21,853 --> 01:07:26,551
盖……我还有个还价。
Timothy... I have a counter offer.

756
01:07:26,654 --> 01:07:28,929
我们把调料放在一边。
Let's put this dressing up aside.

757
01:07:29,031 --> 01:07:31,660
这是给孩子们的。我们不是孩子。
It's for children. And we are not children.

758
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:36,236
我们自己开派对吧。
Let's make our own party.

759
01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:38,667
一个黑暗的聚会。
A dark party.

760
01:07:39,641 --> 01:07:42,944
黑暗的纳粹党。
A dark Nazi party.

761
01:07:42,944 --> 01:07:47,214
有音乐，润滑剂和帅气的纳粹。
With music, lubrication and a handsome Nazi.

762
01:07:48,651 --> 01:07:57,356
自从我来到这里，我就被吱吱作响的东西咬了，蝎子在我的靴子里筑巢，我无法入睡，因为丛林里无情的嚎叫。
Since I've been here, I've been bitten by things that croak and slither, scorpions nest in my boots and I can't sleep for the relentless howl of jungle entropy.

763
01:07:58,053 --> 01:08:03,362
今晚，我要去那个派对，你带我去。
Tonight, I'm going to that party, and you are taking me.

764
01:08:05,095 --> 01:08:07,135
现在，把它穿上。
Now, put it on.

765
01:08:08,572 --> 01:08:09,368
哦。
Oh.

766
01:08:10,704 --> 01:08:11,968
很好。
Very well.

767
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:53,610
啊!你好!
Ah! Hola!

768
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,262
灯灭了我们就搬。
We move when the lights go out.

769
01:09:27,783 --> 01:09:33,281
好了，里卡多，今天你是酋长。
All right, Ricardo, today you're El Capitan.

770
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:36,824
阿曼多，酒吧归你了。
Armando, the bar is yours.

771
01:09:36,824 --> 01:09:39,059
使用它。随意滥用它。
Use it. Abuse it at your will.

772
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:41,860
这就是为什么我爱你。
That's why I love you.

773
01:09:41,962 --> 01:09:43,664
跟我来，帅哥。
Come with me, handsome.

774
01:09:47,532 --> 01:09:49,204
我要你让他们开心。
I need you to keep the men happy.

775
01:09:51,706 --> 01:09:52,735
如何快乐?
How happy?

776
01:10:11,386 --> 01:10:12,183
嗯。
Mmm.

777
01:10:14,963 --> 01:10:17,462
老鼠在巢里吗?
Are the rats in the nest?

778
01:10:17,462 --> 01:10:22,498
今晚你在其他任何地方都找不到德国、西班牙或意大利军官。
You won't find a German, Spanish or Italian officer anywhere else tonight.

779
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:34,040
在港口的啤酒节和这个小聚会之间，90%的士兵都离开了码头。
Between the beer fest at the harbor and this little get-together, that'll be 90% of the soldiers away from the dock.

780
01:10:35,581 --> 01:10:38,418
炸弹将在30分钟内炸毁港口灯光。
The charge is set to blow the harbor lights in 30 minutes.

781
01:10:40,186 --> 01:10:42,552
你能把他关那么久吗?
Can you keep him here that long?

782
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:45,216
傻孩子，傻问题。看看这条裙子。
Silly boy, silly question. Look at the dress.

783
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:56,771
嗨。
Hi.

784
01:10:56,873 --> 01:10:59,031
你把这叫做派对?
So, you call this a party?

785
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,702
这只是一个开端。
This is just the thin end of the wedge.

786
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:03,308
我为你准备了一场表演。
I've created a performance just for you.

787
01:11:03,308 --> 01:11:06,109
我可以带你看看真正的派对。
Well, I could show you a real party.

788
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,772
我干嘛在乎，意大利面?
Why do I care, Spaghetti?

789
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,077
披萨。
Pizza.

790
01:11:37,077 --> 01:11:39,177
失陪一下，我去补个粉。
Excuse me while I powder my nose.

791
01:11:39,177 --> 01:11:41,072
-什么，又来了?
- What, again?

792
01:11:41,072 --> 01:11:43,544
别慌，凯撒。温习你的意大利语。
Don't panic, Caesar. Brush up on your Italian.

793
01:11:43,544 --> 01:11:46,186
你的礼物需要包装。
Your gift needs to be wrapped.

794
01:11:46,186 --> 01:11:48,089
请让警官们继续喝酒。
Keep those officers drinking, please.

795
01:11:48,089 --> 01:11:50,081
-当然。好吧。-谢谢你，费米。
- Of course. Okay. - Thank you, Femi.

796
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:51,953
公爵夫人号的船体已经加固了。
The Duchessa's hull has been reinforced.

797
01:11:52,993 --> 01:11:53,790
它不会沉没。
It won't sink.

798
01:11:55,096 --> 01:11:56,358
我们得停止任务。
We need to stop the mission.

799
01:12:03,104 --> 01:12:04,431
这很难做到。
That's going to be hard to do.

800
01:12:04,431 --> 01:12:06,037
听我说。
Listen to me.

801
01:12:06,139 --> 01:12:07,435
我们的使命将会失败。
Our mission will fail.

802
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:11,302
炸药不起作用，因为他加固了它，使它永不沉没。
The explosives won't work because he's reinforced it to be unsinkable.

803
01:12:13,015 --> 01:12:14,008
你必须马上阻止他们。
You have to stop them now.

804
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,984
但电荷即将吹灭灯光。
But the charge is about to blow the lights.

805
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:24,188
如果你不能阻止灯光，那就阻止那些人。
Well, if you can't stop the lights, stop the men.

806
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,020
鲁尔不能离开这个派对。
Luhr must not leave this party.

807
01:12:27,128 --> 01:12:28,957
我会让他忙起来的。去,现在。
I'll keep him busy. Go, now.

808
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:10,068
我们出发了。
And we're off.

809
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:11,432
格斯等。
Gus, wait.

810
01:13:31,227 --> 01:13:33,560
鹳鸟呼叫女仆，鹳鸟呼叫女仆，请回答。
Stork to Maid, Stork to Maid, come in.

811
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:36,286
五频道。
Channel five.

812
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:37,388
我是梅德。切换到20。
This is Maid. Switching to 20.

813
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:42,136
去做吧。
Go ahead.

814
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:44,263
咸牛肉罐头是打不开的。
Tin of corned beef can't be cracked.

815
01:13:45,206 --> 01:13:46,606
船不会被击沉。
The ship cannot be sunk.

816
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:49,235
炸药会失效。
Explosives will fail.

817
01:13:50,275 --> 01:13:51,869
我是鹳鸟，先生。
It's Stork, sir.

818
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:52,876
打开扬声器。
Put him on open speaker.

819
01:13:54,207 --> 01:13:55,978
咸牛肉是不能碎的。
Corned beef can't be cracked.

820
01:13:56,611 --> 01:13:57,911
鹳，我是M。
Stork, this is M.

821
01:13:58,013 --> 01:13:59,977
别管咸牛肉了。想办法吧。
Never mind the corned beef. Just find a way.

822
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:02,179
——结束了。-炸弹来袭，长官。
- Over. - Pound incoming, sir.

823
01:14:02,179 --> 01:14:03,487
重复……-把它关掉。
-Repeat... - Switch that off.

824
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:08,391
-我们必须…立即停止。
- We must... Stop this immediately.

825
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:13,724
你们的所作所为到此为止，否则你们每个人都将受到法庭的审判。
What you are doing ends now, or every last one of you will be subject to a tribunal.

826
01:14:13,724 --> 01:14:15,567
明白了吗?
Is that clear?

827
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:17,604
我不知道你在说什么，先生。
I don't know what you're talking about, sir.

828
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:21,432
对吗，中士?
Is that correct, Sergeant?

829
01:14:25,314 --> 01:14:26,541
守住阵地。
Hold position.

830
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:28,843
还有多久，鹳鸟?
How long, Stork?

831
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:29,917
等待订单。-给我。
-Awaiting orders. - Give me that.

832
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:30,815
站在。
Stand by.

833
01:14:31,954 --> 01:14:36,187
马奇-菲利普斯，这是庞德上将给你的直接命令。
March-Phillips, this is Admiral Pound giving you a direct order.

834
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:37,918
立即中止任务。
Abort this mission now.

835
01:14:37,918 --> 01:14:41,053
我保证你们谁也见不到天日。
I will make sure that none of you see the light of day again.

836
01:14:41,053 --> 01:14:44,428
你们的余生都将被关起来听凭陛下的安排。
You will spend the rest of your lives locked up at His Majesty's pleasure.

837
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:45,296
这包括你们所有人。
That includes all of you.

838
01:14:45,296 --> 01:14:50,531
杰弗里·阿普尔亚德，安德斯·拉森，-弗雷迪·巴斯…-对不起... ...还有亨利·海斯。
Geoffrey Appleyard, Anders Lassen, - Freddy Buzz... -I'm sorry... ...and Henry Hayes.

839
01:14:50,531 --> 01:14:52,969
我不太明白你在说什么。
Can't quite make out - what you're saying.

840
01:14:54,469 --> 01:14:56,036
再见。
Bye.

841
01:14:56,138 --> 01:14:57,340
——是……明白了吗?
- Is... Is that clear?

842
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,038
抱歉?怎么啦？
Sorry? What?

843
01:14:59,038 --> 01:15:00,914
我不能……我听不太清楚。
I can't... I can't quite hear you.

844
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:03,474
请……滚蛋。
Please... fuck off.

845
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:11,152
你和你的行动太鲁莽了，准将。
You and your operation are reckless, Brigadier.

846
01:15:12,427 --> 01:15:17,394
我将亲自建议议会罢免首相。
I will personally advise parliament to have the Prime Minister removed from office.

847
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:19,127
我要让你关门大吉。
And I am going to shut you down.

848
01:15:20,534 --> 01:15:23,362
我明白了，长官。
Message received loud and clear, sir.

849
01:15:30,006 --> 01:15:32,806
我建议你也滚蛋，中士。
I suggest you also fuck off, Sergeant.

850
01:15:32,806 --> 01:15:34,505
弗莱明，联系马奇-菲利普斯。
Fleming, contact March-Phillips.

851
01:15:38,949 --> 01:15:40,552
莉莉，给我接通首相热线。
Lily, get me the Prime Minister on hotline.

852
01:15:40,552 --> 01:15:41,846
-马上，先生-请进，01
-Right away, sir. - Come in, 01.

853
01:15:41,948 --> 01:15:43,254
请进，收到了吗?
Come in, do you receive?

854
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:51,522
——是吗?-首相，恐怕我们被发现了。
- Yes? -Prime Minister, I'm afraid we've been discovered.

855
01:15:54,432 --> 01:15:58,969
我们中间有内奸庞德上将下令取消这次任务。
There was a mole in our midst and Admiral Pound has ordered the mission to be aborted.

856
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:01,532
他想让议会罢免你。
He wants to have parliament remove you from office.

857
01:16:02,673 --> 01:16:04,001
这项任务必须继续下去。
The mission must continue.

858
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:05,644
01，这是底。结束了。
01, this is base. Over.

859
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:09,150
告诉庞德，如果他有问题，来找我。他知道我住在哪里。
Tell Pound if he has a problem, to take it up with me. He knows where I live.

860
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,880
告诉士兵们继续前进。
Tell the men to press on.

861
01:16:10,982 --> 01:16:13,214
恐怕我们失去了所有的联系，先生。
I'm afraid we've lost all communication, sir.

862
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,292
我们一定能做点什么。
There must be something that we can do.

863
01:16:18,394 --> 01:16:25,798
我唯一能做的就是提醒你，我们选择马奇·菲利普斯的原因是因为他不服从命令。
The only thing I can do is remind you, the reason we chose March-Phillips is because he doesn't follow orders.

864
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:30,363
希望我们选对了。
Then let's hope we chose well.

865
01:16:35,368 --> 01:16:38,068
公爵夫人号的船体已经加固了。
The Duchessa's hull has been reinforced.

866
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:40,044
也就是说她不会被击沉。
Which means she can't be sunk.

867
01:16:40,044 --> 01:16:43,375
至少我们带了这么多炸药。
At least not with the amount of explosives we're carrying.

868
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:45,717
只是想知道这到底是怎么发生的。
Just wondering how and when exactly this took place.

869
01:16:45,717 --> 01:16:47,585
事情发生的时间和方式并不重要。
It's not important how and when, it's happened.

870
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:49,654
这事挺重要的，格斯。
Well, it is kind of important, Gus.

871
01:16:49,654 --> 01:16:53,654
我不在乎坐牢，但我在乎的是完成我们已经开始的事业。
I don't care about the prison time, but I do care about finishing what we've started.

872
01:16:53,654 --> 01:16:55,022
谢谢你，弗雷迪。
Thank you, Freddy.

873
01:16:55,022 --> 01:16:56,130
一定是搞错了。
There must be some sort of mistake.

874
01:16:56,232 --> 01:16:59,092
你不能只是强化……没有错，Haysey。
You can't just reinforce... There's no mistake, Haysey.

875
01:16:59,194 --> 01:17:02,098
我只是不知道如何以及何时……——够了!
I'm just lost about how and when exactly... - Enough!

876
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:12,108
我们为什么不把拖船弄沉?
Why don't we sink the tug boats?

877
01:17:13,647 --> 01:17:15,078
把通往潜艇的穿梭机弄掉。
Get rid of the shuttle to the U-boats.

878
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,108
这还不够。
It's not enough.

879
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,181
他们会在一周内换新的。
They'll replace them in a week.

880
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:30,493
我们为什么不偷呢?
Why don't we steal them?

881
01:17:30,595 --> 01:17:36,634
我们可以用比利的船把公爵夫人号拖出港口然后偷走另外两艘为u型潜艇服务的德国拖船。
We can use Billy's boat to drag the Duchessa out of the harbor and steal the other two German tug boats that service the U-boats.

882
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:38,530
我们该怎么做呢?
And how are we supposed to do that?

883
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:43,936
它不仅是双层的，重量是原来的两倍，而且你需要一个完整的船员来移动这么大的船。
Not only is she double-plated, weighing twice as much, but you'd need a full crew to move a ship that size.

884
01:17:43,936 --> 01:17:45,677
拖船是船员。
The tug boats are the crew.

885
01:17:45,677 --> 01:17:50,715
我们把公爵夫人拖到海里，然后，把所有的东西都偷走。
We tow the Duchessa out to the ocean and, well, steal the lot.

886
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:53,314
然后呢?我们还是不能击沉他们。
Then what? We still can't sink them.

887
01:17:54,453 --> 01:17:55,785
我们不需要。
We don't need to.

888
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:58,951
我们驶进公海，把一切交给海军。
We sail into international waters and hand everything over to the Navy.

889
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:01,492
反正他们在跟踪我们，所以他们会很高兴再见到我们的。
They're following us anyway, so they'll be more than happy to see us again.

890
01:18:01,492 --> 01:18:03,027
那主播呢?
And what about the anchor?

891
01:18:04,366 --> 01:18:05,565
你看到它的大小了吗?
Have you seen the size of it?

892
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:09,533
如果我们真的要转移她，他们的s型船会在几秒内抓住我们。
If we're gonna actually start to move her, their S-boats will catch us in seconds.

893
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:12,036
你准备怎么处理你带来的炸药，弗雷迪?
Well, what are you going to do with all the explosives you brought, Freddy?

894
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:15,906
我们要用它们炸掉锚。
We'll use them to blow the anchor.

895
01:18:15,906 --> 01:18:24,176
我们先把s型潜艇装好，这样他们就追不上了，再把供应u型潜艇的燃料储备装好，然后把那里炸了。
We'll rig the S-boats so they can't follow, rig the fuel reserve that supplies the U-boats, and then, well, blow the lot up.

896
01:18:24,278 --> 01:18:27,419
燃料爆炸会把所有人和他们的母亲带到港口。
That fuel explosion's gonna bring everyone and their mother down to the harbor.

897
01:18:27,521 --> 01:18:31,588
我们设置了引信，这样我们一出港口，燃料堆就会爆炸。
We set the fuse, so that the fuel dump blows once we're outside the harbor.

898
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:34,091
然后我们悄悄溜出去。
Then we sneak out quietly.

899
01:18:35,723 --> 01:18:36,687
不坏。
Not bad.

900
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,998
它非常贪婪。
It's very greedy.

901
01:18:41,866 --> 01:18:47,772
-好吧，我加入。-好吧，除非我有一桶纳粹心脏，否则我是不会走的。
- Well, I'm in. -Well, I'm not leaving until I have a barrel full of Nazi hearts.

902
01:18:47,772 --> 01:18:49,876
我会照你说的做，先生。
I'll do whatever you tell me to do, sir.

903
01:18:52,576 --> 01:18:53,605
先生们,
Gentlemen,

904
01:18:58,716 --> 01:19:00,216
我们去偷几艘船吧。
let's steal some boats.

905
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:12,723
原来她是双面人，所以计划有变。
Turns out she's double-plated, so change of plans.

906
01:19:14,593 --> 01:19:16,233
我们要去偷船。
We're going to steal the boats instead.

907
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,731
这可能吗?
Is that even possible?

908
01:19:22,575 --> 01:19:23,734
我不太确定。
I'm not entirely sure.

909
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,112
但如果你愿意，我们也一样。
But if you're up for it, so are we.

910
01:19:29,374 --> 01:19:30,444
你知道这意味着什么。
And you know what that means.

911
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,454
更多的血，更多的汗。
A lot more blood and a lot more sweat.

912
01:19:34,557 --> 01:19:36,153
希望不是我们的人，老伙计。
Hopefully not any of ours, old boy.

913
01:19:38,388 --> 01:19:40,322
我觉得没有你我们做不到，比利。
I don't think we can do this without you, Billy.

914
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,169
好吧，如果你愿意，我愿意。
Well, I'm up for it if you are.

915
01:19:54,401 --> 01:19:55,737
我想我们需要你的拖船。
I think we're gonna need your tug.

916
01:19:58,914 --> 01:20:03,749
我和海茜会沿着港口散步干掉所有还在巡逻的士兵。
Haysey and I will take a stroll along the harbor and take out any soldiers still patrolling.

917
01:20:03,749 --> 01:20:06,750
弗雷迪会把他的小艇开过来，照顾s艇。
Freddy will bring his dinghy around and take care of the S-boats.

918
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,855
我们在拖船那儿等你。
We'll meet you by the tug boats.

919
01:20:09,448 --> 01:20:10,752
公爵夫人呢?
And the Duchessa?

920
01:20:10,752 --> 01:20:12,319
这就是苹果和我。
That's Apple and me.

921
01:20:12,422 --> 01:20:14,891
我们会处理所有船员，然后炸掉锚。
We'll take care of any crew and blow the anchor.

922
01:20:14,891 --> 01:20:16,094
摧毁他们的通讯。
And destroy their comms.

923
01:20:17,996 --> 01:20:20,062
不知道你在船上会遇到什么。
Not sure what you'll meet on board.

924
01:20:20,062 --> 01:20:22,533
带上我的老大和两个手下。
Take my top boy and two more of my men.

925
01:20:24,638 --> 01:20:26,467
先生们，准备吧。
Gentlemen, let's prepare.

926
01:20:34,780 --> 01:21:02,134
鈾?哦，鲨鱼，宝贝鈾?有这样的牙齿吗，亲爱的鈾?他给他们看珍珠白鈾?只是一把千斤顶刀鈾?老麦克希斯有吗，亲爱的鈾?他把它藏起来鈾?你知道鲨鱼什么时候咬人
鈾?Oh, the shark, babe 鈾? Has such teeth, dear 鈾? And he shows them pearly white 鈾? Just a jack-knife 鈾? Has old MacHeath, dear 鈾?And he keeps it out of sight 鈾?You know when that shark bites

927
01:21:02,134 --> 01:21:27,031
鈾?用他的牙齿，亲爱的鈾?猩红的波涛开始蔓延鈾?漂亮的手套，哦，老麦克希斯戴着，亲爱的鈾?所以从来没有红色的痕迹鈾?在人行道上
鈾?With his teeth, dear 鈾? Scarlet billows starts to spread 鈾? Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, dear 鈾?So there's never, never a trace of red 鈾?On the sidewalk

928
01:21:27,031 --> 01:21:48,213
鈾?星期天早上，你不知道鈾吗?谎言的身体鈾?渗出生命鈾?有人在拐角处偷偷摸摸鈾?会是老刀子麦克吗?
鈾?On Sunday morning, don't you know 鈾? Lies a body 鈾? Oozing life 鈾? And someone sneakin' around the corner 鈾?Could that be old Mack the Knife?

929
01:21:48,213 --> 01:21:53,554
鈾?有一艘拖船鈾?在河边，你不知道吗
鈾?There's a tug boat 鈾? Down by the river, don't cha know

930
01:21:56,425 --> 01:21:59,195
鈾?一个水泥袋耷拉下来…
鈾?Where a cement bag's just a-drooping on down...

931
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:48,078
还没有。
Not yet.

932
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,118
我的先生。
Mein Herr.

933
01:22:58,954 --> 01:23:00,185
Haysey……
Haysey...

934
01:23:48,043 --> 01:23:49,067
就在左边，先生。
Up there on the left, sir.

935
01:23:49,169 --> 01:23:50,668
是的。
Yes.

936
01:23:53,878 --> 01:23:54,911
他撞车了!
He made a crash!

937
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,330
我们可以开那辆车，先生，省点皮鞋。
We could take that car, sir. Save us some shoe leather.

938
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,364
鈾?当心，老麦基回来了鈾?/我
鈾?Look out, old Macky is back 鈾?/i

939
01:25:11,518 --> 01:25:12,324
传入的。
Incoming.

940
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:29,074
论文请。
Papers please.

941
01:25:29,074 --> 01:25:30,841
——指挥官。-没事吧，弗雷迪?
- Commander. - All good, Freddy?

942
01:25:30,943 --> 01:25:33,103
我们一出港就会启动炸药，长官。
Charges are set to go once we're out of the harbor, sir.

943
01:25:34,914 --> 01:25:36,440
那我们继续吧。
Let's carry on then.

944
01:25:51,758 --> 01:25:53,123
你喜欢你的礼物吗?
Did you enjoy your gift?

945
01:25:53,965 --> 01:25:54,993
嗯。
Mmm.

946
01:25:57,299 --> 01:26:04,134
我想现在是时候让狐狸向雌狐展示他的巢穴了。
I think now it's time that the fox shows his den to the vixen.

947
01:26:38,772 --> 01:26:41,006
苍鹭，灯怎么还亮着?
Heron, why are the lights still on?

948
01:26:42,378 --> 01:26:45,549
我用油灯照亮了房间，这样他们就不会注意到停电了。
I lit the room with oil lamps, so they wouldn't notice when the power went out.

949
01:27:28,124 --> 01:27:29,428
-小心!
- Look out!

950
01:27:47,343 --> 01:27:50,240
弗莱迪，装好88号，然后和海茜一起上第一艘拖船。
Freddy, rig this 88, then take the first tug with Haysey.

951
01:27:54,055 --> 01:27:55,887
-晚安。- Guten abend。
- Gute nacht. - Guten abend.

952
01:28:00,993 --> 01:28:02,458
晚上好。
Guten abend.

953
01:28:28,454 --> 01:28:29,617
非常抱歉，老伙计。
Terribly sorry, old boy.

954
01:28:29,719 --> 01:28:33,560
-你介意吗?我似乎……-…我把刀放错了地方。
- Do you mind? I seem to... - ...have misplaced my knife.

955
01:29:37,959 --> 01:29:39,349
——同性恋者!
- Bugger!

956
01:29:46,791 --> 01:29:47,566
谢谢你，比利。
Thank you, Billy.

957
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:58,274
——哦!
- Oh!

958
01:30:54,467 --> 01:30:56,129
我希望那不是你的血，拉森。
I hope that's not your blood, Lassen.

959
01:30:57,235 --> 01:30:58,896
我也希望如此。
I hope so too.

960
01:31:05,275 --> 01:31:06,871
好了，伙计们，开船吧。
Okay, boys, cast off.

961
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:07,943
我们把这艘船弄出去吧。
Let's get this ship out of here.

962
01:31:15,915 --> 01:31:21,253
继续。继续……去吧!
Go on. Go on... Go on!

963
01:31:25,127 --> 01:31:27,963
还有三间这样的房间。
There's three more rooms just like this one.

964
01:31:27,963 --> 01:31:30,130
这应该能在接下来的六个月里阻止德国潜艇的行动。
That should stop the U-boats for the next six months.

965
01:31:31,967 --> 01:31:33,369
我们把这东西拖走吧。
Let's get this thing towed out of here.

966
01:31:33,369 --> 01:31:34,997
我们来了，孩子们。
We are here, boys.

967
01:31:35,099 --> 01:31:36,675
安静的。让我们设置一个警告。
Quietly. Let's set a warning.

968
01:31:42,845 --> 01:31:47,283
我要你去船头把火神号绑在公爵夫人号上，拉森和我去舰桥。
I need you to go to the front of the boat and attach the Vulcan to the Duchessa, Lassen and I will head to the bridge.

969
01:31:47,283 --> 01:31:49,149
好吧。
Okay.

970
01:31:50,754 --> 01:31:52,790
站在右边。
Take the right side.

971
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:54,385
而你，站上去，把它启动。
And you, get up there and get this thing started.

972
01:32:06,974 --> 01:32:08,003
格斯。
It's Gus.

973
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:10,544
所有人都就位了。
Everyone's in place.

974
01:32:13,606 --> 01:32:16,715
怎么，你不会真觉得这能行吧?
What, you didn't actually think it would work, did you?

975
01:32:17,986 --> 01:32:18,882
这是你的计划。
It was your plan.

976
01:32:20,011 --> 01:32:22,947
好吧，让我们确保遵守我们的承诺。
Well, let's make sure we keep our end of the bargain.

977
01:32:22,947 --> 01:32:24,415
回个信号，我就离开。
Signal back and I'll heave off.

978
01:32:27,128 --> 01:32:28,790
那么，现在发生了什么?
So, what happens now?

979
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,427
我们等锚链爆炸。
We wait for the anchor chain to blow.

980
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,265
我们预计什么时候会发生?
When do we expect that to happen?

981
01:32:32,367 --> 01:32:34,332
-我希望很快。
- Shortly, I hope.

982
01:32:34,332 --> 01:32:36,626
然后我们就可以带走她了。
And then we're free to take her.

983
01:32:36,626 --> 01:32:41,102
然而，真正的竞赛在燃料库耗尽后才开始。
However, the real race begins once the fuel depot goes.

984
01:32:41,204 --> 01:32:43,434
那岛上所有的士兵都会出动。
Then we'll have every soldier on the island turning up.

985
01:32:45,678 --> 01:32:47,779
我们可不想目睹这一切。
We don't wanna be around to witness that.

986
01:32:49,348 --> 01:32:51,750
你绑在锚链上的保险丝有多长?
How long was that fuse you attached to the anchor chain?

987
01:32:53,221 --> 01:32:54,218
我们很快就会知道了。
We'll find out soon enough.

988
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,255
等一下，你会抓住绳子的。
Wait for it, you're gonna catch the rope.

989
01:33:08,694 --> 01:33:09,559
来吧。
Come on.

990
01:33:29,619 --> 01:33:30,954
第一张多米诺骨牌倒下了。
First domino falls.

991
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,290
-挂上另一条线。-是的，老板。
- Hitch up the other line. - Yes, boss.

992
01:33:34,392 --> 01:33:35,420
收拾残局。
Pick up the slack.

993
01:33:37,722 --> 01:33:39,831
他们得在燃料堆爆炸前转移她。
They need to move her before the fuel dump blows.

994
01:33:41,433 --> 01:33:42,893
赫伦，我们需要玛乔丽。
Heron, we need Marjorie.

995
01:33:42,893 --> 01:33:44,928
把玛乔丽交给我吧。
Leave Marjorie to me.

996
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:46,167
我们会赶上你的。
We'll catch you up.

997
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:48,070
很好。
Very good.

998
01:33:48,768 --> 01:33:50,075
我们走吧!
Let's go!

999
01:34:34,412 --> 01:34:35,953
我不得不说，小姐
I have to say, Fraulein,

1000
01:34:38,621 --> 01:34:39,649
你表现得很好。
you were good.

1001
01:34:41,085 --> 01:34:42,652
你很狡猾。
And you were sly.

1002
01:34:43,861 --> 01:34:47,657
像狐狸一样狡猾的人只有两种。
There are only two types of people that are as sly as the fox.

1003
01:34:48,828 --> 01:34:52,464
德国人和犹太人。
The German and the Jew.

1004
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:59,537
你也不是德国人。
And you are not German.

1005
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:02,344
我想现在是时候……
I think now it's time...

1006
01:35:04,509 --> 01:35:06,348
-…为了一个真正的派对。
- ...for a real party.

1007
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:19,224
这是不应该发生的。
That wasn't supposed to happen yet.

1008
01:35:23,962 --> 01:35:25,101
卸扣她!
Shackle her!

1009
01:35:25,998 --> 01:35:26,773
跟我来。
And follow me.

1010
01:35:30,576 --> 01:35:32,178
港口被攻击了!
The harbor is under attack!

1011
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:53,525
他们的到来。
They're coming.

1012
01:35:58,604 --> 01:35:59,905
我们需要给引擎提供动力。
We need power on the engine.

1013
01:36:04,536 --> 01:36:06,736
-她太重了!-振作起来!
- She's too heavy! - Pick up the slack!

1014
01:36:18,624 --> 01:36:20,050
等待……
Wait...

1015
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:24,996
她没动!
She's not moving!

1016
01:36:26,731 --> 01:36:29,300
火!火!火!
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1017
01:36:29,402 --> 01:36:30,267
等一下。
Wait for it.

1018
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:53,217
我们需要增加引擎的动力。
We need more power on the engine.

1019
01:36:53,217 --> 01:36:55,691
给我更多的力量!更多的力量!
Give me more power! More power!

1020
01:36:57,222 --> 01:36:58,590
就是这样，它起作用了!
That's it, it's working!

1021
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:00,698
-就是这样!
- That's it!

1022
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:28,895
准备好了!
Ready!

1023
01:37:50,508 --> 01:37:51,885
——Haysey !
-  Haysey!

1024
01:38:52,008 --> 01:38:53,705
我们已经超出射程了。
We're out of range now.

1025
01:38:55,607 --> 01:38:57,115
-我不是专家。
- I'm no expert.

1026
01:38:57,217 --> 01:38:59,650
但你肩膀上有个大洞，海赛。
But you've got a big old hole in your shoulder, Haysey.

1027
01:39:47,766 --> 01:39:51,664
上尉，你能跟我解释一下这是怎么回事吗?
Captain, would you explain to me what's going on here?

1028
01:39:52,902 --> 01:39:54,872
没电了。
The power is gone.

1029
01:39:54,974 --> 01:39:57,302
燃料库遭到破坏。
The fuel depot has been sabotaged.

1030
01:39:57,405 --> 01:39:58,477
没人知道发生了什么。
And no one knows what's happening.

1031
01:39:58,579 --> 01:39:59,675
但这是你的错。
But this is your fault.

1032
01:39:59,777 --> 01:40:01,014
我的船在哪里?
Where is my ship?

1033
01:40:02,948 --> 01:40:04,543
公爵夫人，它去哪儿了?
The Duchessa, where did it go?

1034
01:40:04,645 --> 01:40:06,811
有人趁你不注意把他带走了。
Someone's taken him while you weren't looking.

1035
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:09,281
你这个笨蛋!
You idiot!

1036
01:40:09,281 --> 01:40:12,652
你总是在不合适的时候说错话。
You always have to say something at the very wrong time.

1037
01:40:13,927 --> 01:40:16,557
和你在一起永远没有合适的时间!
There is never a right time with you!

1038
01:40:17,632 --> 01:40:20,962
你的贪婪和堕落让你无法履行职责。
Your greed and perversion has distracted you from your duties.

1039
01:40:20,962 --> 01:40:22,732
现在我的港口被毁了。
Now my harbor is destroyed.

1040
01:40:22,834 --> 01:40:24,169
我的船不见了!
And my ship is gone!

1041
01:40:28,007 --> 01:40:30,839
现在你也走了。谢谢你！
And now you're gone too. Thank you.

1042
01:40:59,035 --> 01:41:00,029
让人印象深刻。
Impressive.

1043
01:41:03,142 --> 01:41:04,267
听起来你的雷管起作用了。
Sounds like your detonators worked.

1044
01:41:41,506 --> 01:41:43,611
帽子,小姐。
Chapeau, mademoiselle.

1045
01:41:43,713 --> 01:41:46,944
你打得很好。你真是个狐狸精。
You play well. You really are the vixen.

1046
01:41:48,279 --> 01:41:49,078
我是吗?
Am I?

1047
01:41:51,088 --> 01:41:52,752
好吧，我的手露出来了。
Well, my hand's been revealed.

1048
01:41:56,564 --> 01:41:58,795
那么，现在怎么办?
So, what now?

1049
01:41:58,897 --> 01:42:09,639
现在我握着你的手，因为你对我所做的一切，我要加倍惩罚你。
Now, I possess your hand and for everything you have done to me, I will visit a thousand fold upon you.

1050
01:42:16,914 --> 01:42:17,942
是的。
Yeah.

1051
01:42:25,316 --> 01:42:26,115
但是没有。
But no.

1052
01:42:40,005 --> 01:42:41,438
-躺下。
- Lie down.

1053
01:42:45,241 --> 01:42:48,137
格斯，我们不能再等了。
Gus, we can't wait much longer.

1054
01:42:51,751 --> 01:42:52,847
他们的到来。
They're coming.

1055
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:56,622
如果我们呆在这里，就会和其他人失去联系。
If we stay here, we'll lose contact with the others.

1056
01:42:56,622 --> 01:42:58,585
坚持住，比利。
Hold fast, Billy.

1057
01:42:58,585 --> 01:43:03,988
赫伦有自己的生存之道，而玛乔丽…祝你好运。
Heron has a way of surviving and Marjorie, well... good luck with that.

1058
01:43:09,301 --> 01:43:11,061
那是一艘巡逻艇向我们驶来。
That's a patrol boat coming towards us.

1059
01:43:15,604 --> 01:43:17,166
-古斯，我们得走了。现在。
- Gus, we need to leave. Now.

1060
01:43:18,436 --> 01:43:19,575
坚持……
Hold on...

1061
01:43:31,988 --> 01:43:33,017
这是他们。
It's them.

1062
01:43:34,453 --> 01:43:35,855
RH。
RH.

1063
01:43:36,995 --> 01:43:39,164
- - - - - - KB。马乔里。
- KB. -Marjorie.

1064
01:43:39,164 --> 01:43:41,432
同时穿得太正式和太不正式。
Overdressed and underdressed at the same time.

1065
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:46,195
来吧，让我把你的镣铐解开。
Come on, let's get you out of those shackles.

1066
01:43:51,776 --> 01:43:53,977
进来，维奥莱特。
Come in, Violet.

1067
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:55,204
呼叫维奥莱特号。
Calling H.M.S. Violet.

1068
01:43:56,817 --> 01:43:58,040
进来，维奥莱特。
Come in, Violet.

1069
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,378
这是伴娘荣誉。
This is Maid Honor.

1070
01:43:59,378 --> 01:44:00,385
说吧，荣誉女仆。
Go ahead, Maid Honor.

1071
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:03,378
——扬声器。
- Loudspeaker.

1072
01:44:03,378 --> 01:44:07,524
很抱歉在晚上这个时候打扰您，但我们发现有一两件商品您可能会感兴趣。
Sorry to bother you at this time of the night, but we've found ourselves with one or two items that might be of interest to you.

1073
01:44:09,163 --> 01:44:10,593
我们会合交接好吗?
Shall we rendezvous for a handover?

1074
01:44:12,195 --> 01:44:13,658
给我接庞德上将。
Get me Admiral Pound.

1075
01:44:23,371 --> 01:44:27,308
——是吗?先生-有好消息也有坏消息。-是的，是的。开始吧。
- Yes? Sir, - good news and bad news. - Yes, yes. Get to it.

1076
01:44:27,308 --> 01:44:29,040
坏消息是，他们没有击沉她。
Bad news, they didn't sink her.

1077
01:44:29,848 --> 01:44:32,615
好消息是，他们把她偷走了。
Good news, they stole her.

1078
01:44:34,119 --> 01:44:36,384
祝贺你，总理。
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

1079
01:45:04,577 --> 01:45:05,450
别动!
Hold it there!

1080
01:45:06,753 --> 01:45:08,019
指挥官。
Commander.

1081
01:45:08,121 --> 01:45:10,722
庞德上将命令你停止行动。
You were ordered by Admiral Pound to cease activities.

1082
01:45:10,722 --> 01:45:12,752
你没有。
You did not.

1083
01:45:12,752 --> 01:45:16,822
因此，你将被送回英格兰接受审判。你。
Therefore, you are to be returned to England to face a tribunal. You.

1084
01:45:16,925 --> 01:45:20,264
带着你的民兵回到你的拖船上。
Return to your tug with the rest of your militia.

1085
01:45:20,264 --> 01:45:21,593
-带他们去禁闭室-长官!
- Take them to the brig. -Sir!

1086
01:45:21,593 --> 01:45:24,361
我也很高兴见到你，指挥官。
Good to see you too, Commander.

1087
01:45:24,464 --> 01:45:26,134
单独的细胞。
Separate cells.

1088
01:45:26,134 --> 01:45:28,170
跟我来!
Follow me!

1089
01:45:28,272 --> 01:45:29,804
我们走吧!我们走吧!
Let's go! Let's get moving!

1090
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:33,140
- RH。- - - - - - KB。
- RH. - KB.

1091
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:34,204
来吧。
Come on.

1092
01:45:35,683 --> 01:45:37,046
继续，走吧。
Go on, move.

1093
01:45:37,148 --> 01:45:37,944
等一下，海员。
One moment, seaman.

1094
01:45:42,282 --> 01:45:43,312
比利。
Billy.

1095
01:45:45,751 --> 01:45:49,494
一只眼睛盯着边界……一只眼睛盯着酒吧。
One eye on the boundary... One eye on the pub.

1096
01:45:51,759 --> 01:45:53,322
总有一天他们会感谢你的。
They'll thank you for this one day.

1097
01:45:54,196 --> 01:45:59,328
我不确定那是不是我们真正想要的，是吧，殿下?
I'm not sure that's what we were really looking for, was it, Your Highness?

1098
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:03,904
商店随时为你开门，少校。
Shop's open for you anytime, Major.

1099
01:46:14,816 --> 01:46:17,819
抱歉打扰了，首相，但我觉得你应该看看这个。
Sorry to intrude, Prime Minister, but M thought you should see this.

1100
01:46:23,459 --> 01:46:24,353
谢谢你，歌洛莉亚。
Thank you, Gloria.

1101
01:46:34,737 --> 01:46:37,234
流程。脸前!
-Line up. Face front!

1102
01:46:38,473 --> 01:46:43,276
排队。脸前!
Line up. Face front!

1103
01:46:43,378 --> 01:46:44,450
没必要大喊大叫。
No need to shout.

1104
01:46:47,889 --> 01:46:49,648
站着不动!
Stand still!

1105
01:46:49,648 --> 01:46:51,380
能给我一杯茶吗?
Any chance of a cup of tea?

1106
01:46:52,356 --> 01:46:53,716
你，退到墙边去。
You, back up to the wall.

1107
01:46:53,818 --> 01:46:54,955
脱布，飞蛾。
Off the cloth, moth.

1108
01:46:56,194 --> 01:46:57,287
站直!
Stand straight!

1109
01:47:08,838 --> 01:47:14,777
这个国家的高级陆军和海军指挥官从未如此团结一致地谴责。
Never before have the senior Military and Navy Commanders of this country been so united in their condemnation.

1110
01:47:15,707 --> 01:47:27,724
他们认为，我们的军队所依赖的纪律已经被那些不为主人服务的人破坏了，他们只对血腥、谋杀和伤害感兴趣。
It is their view that the discipline on which our armed forces depends has been undermined by men serving no master but their own thirst for blood, murder and mayhem.

1111
01:47:30,097 --> 01:47:32,894
那些不服从舰队司令直接命令的人，
Men who disobeyed a direct order from the Admiral of the fleet himself,

1112
01:47:34,935 --> 01:47:41,430
而是选择相信站在他身边的人的心血来潮和直觉。
and chose instead to trust the whim and intuition of the man standing beside him.

1113
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:44,433
他们怎么敢。
How dare they.

1114
01:47:47,113 --> 01:47:55,312
就在今天早上，第一批美国士兵抵达英国土地，准备在欧洲与我们并肩作战。
When only this morning, the first American soldiers arrived on British soil, ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with us in Europe.

1115
01:47:57,052 --> 01:48:08,094
那些冒着生命危险穿越北大西洋的盟军，奇迹般地没有受到纳粹u型潜艇的干扰。
Allies who risked death crossing the North Atlantic, and only by some miracle found their crossing untroubled by Nazi U-boats.

1116
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:20,770
我可以补充一句，这是一个令人高兴的情况，虽然无法解释，但它为美国参加欧洲战争扫清了道路。
A happy circumstance, I might add, which cannot be accounted for, but which has cleared the way for the United States to enter the European war.

1117
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:26,277
我知道罗斯福总统对此感激不尽。
And for which I know President Roosevelt to be immeasurably grateful.

1118
01:48:29,913 --> 01:48:39,328
但是，撇开这一笔无法解释的好运不谈，对这群不服从命令的不守规矩的人该怎么办呢?
But setting aside this stroke of unexplained fortune, what is to be done with this unruly company who do not obey orders?

1119
01:48:39,328 --> 01:48:44,631
他们似乎已经形成了自己的非绅士战争部。
Who seem to have formed their own ministry of ungentlemanly warfare.

1120
01:48:49,539 --> 01:48:51,203
从现在开始，他们为我工作。
From now on, they work for me.
