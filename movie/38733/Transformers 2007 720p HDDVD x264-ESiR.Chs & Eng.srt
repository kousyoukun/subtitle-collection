2
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,480
很久很久以前 火种魔方就已经存在了
Before time began, there was the Cube.

3
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,150
我们不知道它从哪里来
We know not where it comes from,

4
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,490
只知道它拥有创造世界和生命的力量
only that it holds the power to create worlds and fill them with life.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,090
我们这个种族就是这样诞生的
That is how our race was born.

6
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,670
我们一直和谐地生活着
For a time, we lived in harmony,

7
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,330
就像其它巨大的能量一样 人们使用的动机有善有恶
but like all great power, some wanted it for good, others for evil.

8
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,570
所以战争开始了
And so began the war,

9
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,710
一场使我们的星球毁灭的战争
a war that ravaged our planet until it was consumed by death,

10
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,950
火种魔方也失落在浩瀚的宇宙里
and the Cube was lost to the far reaches of space.

11
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:39,360
我们搜寻了整个银河 希望可以找到它来重建我们的家园
We scattered across the galaxy, hoping to find it and rebuild our home,

12
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,960
寻找每一个星球 每一个世界 的角落
searching every star, every world.

13
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,440
就当我们都失去希望时 新的线索把我们带到了一个行星
And just when all hope seemed lost, message of a new discovery drew us

14
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,980
叫做 地球
to an unknown planet called Earth.

16
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,250

Oh, God, five months of this.

19
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,390
我都等不及要回家了
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,530
我很想念我妈妈煮的鳄鱼肉
A plate of mama's alligators etouffee.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
你说唠唠叨叨烤蟋蟀 都说了2个星期了
You've been talking about barbecued 'gators and crickets

22
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,070
打死我也不去吃你妈妈做的饭
for the last two weeks. I'm never going to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

23
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,480
博比 鳄鱼肉是出了名的嫩
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known to have the most succulent meat.

25
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,520
西班牙崽儿 说国语
English, please. English.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,320
说过多少次了... 咱们听不懂番话
I mean, how many times have we... We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

27
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,620
别破坏我自己的传统 行不?
Why you got to ruin it for me, man? That's my heritage.

28
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,660
随便你吧 受够了
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

29
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,790
还记得我们是怎么过周末的吗 在芬维公园看红袜队的比赛
Hey, you guys remember weekends? Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

30
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,570
-美味的热狗和冰镇的啤酒  -完美的一天
-Cold hotdog and a flat beer. -Perfect day.

31

32
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,780

I just can't wait to hold my baby girl for the first time.

-好男人啊  -太...
-He's adorable. -That's too...

闭嘴 
Shut up!

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,370

Hey, I'm ready to do this.

36
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,360

Hey, any of y'all grow some balls, come see me on the court, man.

Watch this crossover, baby.

38

In fact, he was one of the first to explore the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

107
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,100

In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors straight into the Arctic Shelf.

指南针是一个很好的哥伦布节的礼物
And the compass makes a great gift for Columbus Day.

128
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,870
-山姆  -对不起
-Sam! -Sorry.

129
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,800
不幸的是 我的曾曾祖父
Unfortunately, my great-great-grandfather,

130
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,740
他瞎了又疯了 还给关进精神病院
the genius that he was, wound up going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

131
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,000
画这些奇怪的符号
drawing these strange symbols

132
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,580
说一些关于他所发现的
and babbling on about some giant ice man

133
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,340
巨大的冰人的事情
that he thought he'd discovered.

134
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,280
也许明天会有考试 也许不会
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow. Might not.

135
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,680
-今晚在恐惧中入睡吧  -要吗 50 40 30 
-Sleep in fear tonight. -Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

136
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,120
-山姆  -对不起 对不起
-Sam? -Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

137
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,780
很不错 对吗 
Okay. Pretty good, right?

138
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,130
我想 良下 算个好成绩
I'd say a solid B-.

139
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,820
良下?
A B-?

140
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,960
你在说一些关于你曾曾祖父的无聊的事情
You were hawking your great-grandfather's crap

141
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,230
-在我的课堂上  -不 大家喜欢...
-in my classroom. -No, kids enjoy...

142
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,570
-能帮个忙吗  -干什么 
-Look, can you do me a favor? -What?

143
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,000
瞧窗外 望过去 看到我父亲了吗 
Can you look out the window for a second? You see my father?

144
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,670
-绿色车里那个  -然后?
-He's the guy in the green car. -Yeah.

145
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,400
我要告诉你一个梦想 一个男孩的梦想
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream. A boy's dream.

146
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,280
一个男人答应那个男孩
And a man's promise to that boy.

147
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,210
他看着我的眼睛说 "儿子 我会给你买一辆车"
He looked at me in the eye. He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

148
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,580
"但是你得要给我2000美元和3个优"
"But I want you to bring me $2,000 and three As."

149
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,810
我已经有了2000美元和2个优
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

150
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,980
这是我的梦想 你的"良下"把梦想破灭了
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-. Dream gone. Kaput.

151
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,890
老师您自问一下 如果您是耶稣基督 会怎么做 
Sir, just ask yourself, what would Jesus do?

152
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,630
太棒了 
Yes! Yes, yes.

153
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,140
怎么样 
So?

154
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,440
优下 也算是优吧
A-. It's an A, though.

155
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,300
等一等 我看不清楚 是个优 没问题的
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

156
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,100
-那么 通过啦  -通过啦
-So I'm good? -You're good.

157
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,110
-儿子 我有一个惊喜给你  -什么样的惊喜 
-I got a little surprise for you, son. -What kind of...

158
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,440
小小的惊喜
Yeah, a little surprise.

159
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,080
不 不 不 不 爸爸 
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

160
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,540
-你一定是在开玩笑  -看 
-Oh, you got to be kidding me. -See?

161
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,590
是的 我是在开玩笑 你不会得到一辆保时捷
Yeah. I am. You're not getting a Porsche.

162
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,950
-你认为那很可笑吗  -是的 非常可笑
-You think that's funny? -Yeah, I think it's funny.

163
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,530
-你怎么回事  -你真以为我给你买的
-What's wrong with you? -You think I'd really get you

164
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,290
第一辆车就是保时捷?
a Porsche for your first car?

165
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,600
我以后不会再和你说这件事了
I don't want to talk to you for the rest of this whole thing.

166
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,190
-拜托 就是个现实的笑话  -哪里好笑了?
-Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke. -It's not a funny joke.

167
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,810
-曼尼  -怎么 
-Manny! -What?

168
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,370
别让你表弟穿这个
Get your cousin out of that damn clown suit.

169
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,570
他热得发晕了
He's having a heat stroke again.

170
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,740
吓坏了白人客户
Scaring white folks.

171
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,750
我很热 妆要化了 我眼睛疼
I'm hot! Makeup's melting. It hurts my eyes.

172
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,180
老爹 这是什么玩意儿 你许诺的是半辆车哦
Here? No, no, no, what is this? You said... You said half a car,

173
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,850
而不是半辆破烂
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

174
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,320
我像你这么大时 能有辆车就很开心了
When I was your age, I'd have been happy with four wheels and an engine.

175
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,890
听我道来 听我道来 
Okay, let me explain something to you. Okay?

176
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,320
-看没看过 40岁的老处男   -看过
-You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin? -Yeah.

177
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,520
那么 你身旁的某人 将会是50岁的老处男
Okay, that's what this is. And this is 50-year-old virgin.

178
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,390
-好吧  -你想我以后变成这样吗 
-Okay. -You want me to live that life?

179
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,700
-没有付出就没有胜利  -嗯 我知道
-No sacrifice, no victory. -Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

180
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,060
-我知道这句咱家的格言  -对
-The old Witwicky motto, Dad. -Right.

181
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,230
先生们
Gentlemen.

182
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,110
鲍比・玻利维亚 就像那个国家 逃亡者例外
Bobby Bolivia, like the country, except without the runs.

183
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,300
想要点什么 
How can I help you?

184
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,170
我儿子要买他的第一辆车
Well, my son here, looking to buy his first car.

185
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,170
-所以你来找我了  -没办法
-You come to see me? -I had to.

186
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,650
那我们就是一家人了 你可以叫我鲍比・B 简称B叔叔
That practically makes us family. Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

187
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,120
-山姆  -山姆 我来跟你说
-Sam. -Sam, let me talk to you.

188
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,090
山姆 你的第一道大餐就在当中
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom awaits underneath one of those hoods.

189
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,200
我来告诉你个真理 不是驾驶员挑车
Let me tell you something, son. A driver don't pick the car.

190
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,230
而是车挑驾驶员
The car'll pick the driver.

191
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,130
这是人类和汽车间的缘分
It's a mystical bond between man and machine.

192
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,140
孩子 我本事很大的 吹牛除外
Son, I'm a lot of things, but a liar's not one of them.

193
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,770
尤其不在我妈妈面前 那就是我妈妈 嘿 妈咪 
Especially not in front of my mammy. That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

194
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,540
别那样 要是有块板砖 我拍烂你的头 贱人
Don't be like that. If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

195
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,710
我告诉你 伙计 她是聋子
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

196
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:52,350
看这边 每辆都不错
Well, over here, every piece of car a man might want or need.

197
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,890
这辆不错
This ain't bad.

198
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,220
-这车有赛车的条纹  -是啊
-This one's got racing stripes. -Yeah.

199
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,660
有条纹...
It got racing...

200
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,170
这车哪里冒出来的
Yeah, what's this? What the heck is this?

201
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,030
我咋没见过呢
I don't know nothing about this car.

202
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,370
-曼尼  -干什么 
-Manny! -What?

203
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,070
这是谁的车 去查一下 
What is this? This car! Check it out!

204
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,670
我不知道 老板 我以前没见过 
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it! That's loco!

205
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,270
嗦屁阿 快去查查 
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny! Find out!

206
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,900
感觉不错
Feels good.

207
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,480
-多少钱  -嗯
-How much? -Well,

208
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,450
根据这辆车的外形
considering the semi-classic nature of the vehicle,

209
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,350
加上特殊的喷漆和工艺...
with the slick wheels and the custom paint job...

210
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,520
-漆已经掉色了  -材质和工艺是特殊的
-Yeah, but the paint's faded. -Yeah, but it's custom.

211
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,650
特殊的掉色漆?
It's custom faded?

212
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,530
你第一次买车 所谓外行看热闹 内行看门道 一口价
Well, this is your first car. I wouldn't expect you to understand.

213
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,430
-5千块  -4千多1分都不干
-Five grand. -No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

214
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,430
孩子 从车里出来
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

215
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,100
我还没... 你说车挑驾驶员的
No, no, no. You said cars pick their drivers.

216
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,400
驾驶员有一个抠门的父亲则另当别论 快下车
Well, sometimes they pick a driver with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

217
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,670
这边这辆就4千块了
Now, this one here for four Gs is a beaut.

218
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,910
那辆也有赛车的条纹
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes over there.

219
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,610
我不想要那个带条纹的福特嘉年华
No, I don't want a Fiesta with racing stripes.

220
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,740
这车有一个经典的引擎
This is a classic engine right here.

221
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,190
前几天才卖一辆
I sold a car the other day...

222
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,660
噢 宝贝
Gee. Holy cow.

223
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,190
-别担心  -你没事吧 
-No, no, no. No worries. -You all right?

224
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,060
我去弄个大锤把这个敲下来 曼尼 出来
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

225
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,830
让你表弟弄些锤子来
Get your clown cousin and get some hammers

226
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,060
把这东西敲下去
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

227
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,100
...比人类伟大...

228

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,340
你好 部长先生
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

233
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,940
他们太年轻了
They're so young.

234
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,170
他们可是最好的分析专家
They're the top subject matter experts, sir.

235
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,550
这几年国安局都直接从高中招人
NSA's recruiting right out of high school these days.

236
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,020
同伴们 看 国防部长
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

237
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
我穿的衣服真不适合这个场合
I am so underdressed.

238
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,220
女士们 先生们 国防部长
Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of Defense.

239
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,760
请坐
Please be seated.

240
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,790
敝人约翰・凯勒
I'm John Keller.

241
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,170
你们应该想知道你们为什么会在这里
Obviously, you're wondering why you're here, so these are the facts.

242
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,440
在昨天当地时间19时整
At 1900 local time yesterday,

243
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,740
在卡塔尔的索克特森 美军基遭到袭击
the SOCCENT Forward Operations Base in Qatar was attacked.

244
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,210
具目前所了解的资料看 没有幸存者
So far as we know, there were no survivors.

245
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,910
攻击的目的是为了侵入军方的电脑网络
The objective of the attack was to hack our military network.

246
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,140
目前还不知道他们要找什么
We're not sure exactly what they're after,

247
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,690
但是我们知道他们的侵入被阻止了
but we do know that they were cut off during the assault,

248
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,660
所以我们认为他们会再次袭击
which would lead us to assume that they're going to try it again.

249
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,060
目前尚未有人为该事件负责
Now, no one's taken responsibility for the attack.

250
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,160
我们现在唯一的线索是这个声音
And the only real lead we have so far is this sound.

251
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,440
即侵入我们系统的信号
That's the signal that hacked our network.

252
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,010
国家安全局正在全力分析
NSA's working at full capacity to analyze it

253
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,580
希望能拦截未来的通讯
and intercept further communications,

254
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,480
因此需要你们来找出谁是幕后黑手
but we need your help to find out who did this.

255
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,780
你们都有很强的信号分析技能
Now, you've all shown considerable ability in the area of signals analysis.

256
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,490
现在情况紧急
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

257
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,190
总统已经派出航母战斗群
The President has dispatched battle groups

258
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,460
前往波斯湾和黄海 再也不会比这更严重了
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea. This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

259
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,190
你们会由负责的官员领导
Now I'm gonna leave you to your officer-in-charge.

260
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,200
领队们会把你们分成小组开始工作
You'll break up into teams and you'll start your work.

261
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,830
祝我们好运
Good luck to us all.

262
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,720
小麻鸡 我有车了 还得找个靓妞
All right, Mojo. I got the car. Now I need the girl.

263
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,420
再弄些钱带妞出去爽一圈
I need money to take out the girl is what I need.

264
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,650
零个竞标
Zero bids.

265
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,430
安逸 身无分文
Great. Broke.

266
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,900
小麻鸡 想要你的止痛药吗?
Come on, Mojo. You want your pain pills?

267
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,200
还没熟透
No. Premature.

268
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,630
你好吗 
Good. What's up?

269
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,570
没什么 只是开车而已 开我的车
Nothing. You know, just driving my car. Driving my car.

270
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,070
就像是时钟发条
It's like clockwork.

271
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,770
我知道这东西让你爽歪了
All right, I know you get wasted on these things,

272
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,940
但你要是再在我床上撒尿 就到外面睡去 你的明白?
but if you piss in my bed again, you're sleeping outside. Okay?

273
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,350
今天到此为止了 别吃了 瘾君子
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

274
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,550
-荣恩 这里不平  -也许吧
-Ron, this one is uneven. -Yeah. Probably.

275
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,850
这块要掉了
This one is wobbly.

276
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,050
-放心 我会搞好的  -我们能不能请一个专业的人 
-Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon. -Couldn't we have hired a professional?

277
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,290
-山姆...  -吼什么 
-Sam... -What?

278
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
我不想在我的草坪上看到脚印
I do not like footprints on my grass.

279
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,260
-什么脚印 没脚印啊  -不是铺了条石子路的
-What foot... There's no footprints. -That's why I built my path.

280
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,060
你为什么不从草地移到石子路上来 
So why don't you go from my grass onto my path, okay?

281
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,300
-这草地是属于整个家的  -当你拥有你自己的草地的时候
-It's family grass, Dad. -Well, when you own your own grass,

282
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,500
-你会明白的  -我受不了了
-you'll understand. -This... I can't do it anymore.

283
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,700
你把女性的饰品戴在一条公狗身上
-You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog. -What?

284
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,970
作为一条吉娃娃犬 他有严重的自信心问题
He's got enough self-esteem issues as a Chihuahua, Mom.

285
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,640
那是他的首饰
That's his bling.

286
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,950
记住 11点前回家来
I want you home at 11:00!

287
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,910
-没问题  -11点
-Yeah, all right. -11:00!

288
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,140
看在上帝的份上 小心开车
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

289
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,480
系上安全带 
Seat belt on!

290
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,450
喔 你可真小气
Wow. You are so cheap.

291
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,560
那是他的第一辆车 应该是这样的
Well, it's his first car. Supposed to be like that.

292
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,970
目前我们无法确认是否有幸存者存在
At this time, we can't confirm whether there were any survivors.

293
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,480
天啊
Oh, my God.

294
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,410
已启动三级战备状态为目前
Our bases worldwide are, as of now, at DEFCON Delta,

295
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,640
最高警戒水准
our highest readiness level.

296
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,680
我们面对着一个从未见过的
We're dealing with a very effective weapons system

297
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,150
非常强大的武器系统
that we have not come across before.

298
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,290
我们会为那些勇敢的士兵祈祷
But our prayers are with the families of the brave men and women...

299
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,220
爸爸会没事的
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

300
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,050
我以前从未见过这种武器系统
I've never seen a weapons system like this.

301
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,030
热成像显示在它的外骨骼结构周围
The thermal shows this weird aura around the exoskeleton

302
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,230
有一个无形的能量罩
like it's cloaked by some kind of invisible force field.

303
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,630
那不可能 根本没有什么无形的能量罩
That's impossible. There's no such thing as invisible force fields

304
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,900
你当这是放动画片呢?
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

305
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,310
-我不明白  -怎么了 
-Man, I don't know. -What is that?

306
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,570
我老妈 她有种天赋
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

307
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,650
我妈妈可以看见未来 我有她的遗传
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

308
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,710
那个攻击我们的家伙 我肯定它还会回来的
and that thing that attacked us? I got a feeling it ain't over.

309
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,320
噢 伟大的法师 麻烦你开个传送门
How about you use those magic voodoo powers

310
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,010
好让大伙一块回主城去
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

311
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,490
当我照相的时候 我想它看到我了
When I took that picture, I think it saw me.

312
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,460
它盯着我看
It looked right at me.

313
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,470
我们要马上把它送到五角大楼
All right, we got to get this thing back to the Pentagon right away.

314
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,000
军方得知道我们的敌人是什么
They got to know what we're dealing with here.

315
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,430
无线电失灵了
My radio's fried.

316
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,530
-天线没有信号  -马弗斯
-I got no communication with aerial. -Hey, Mahfouz.

317
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,610
-你家离这里有多远  -不远了 翻过那座山就到了
-How far do you live from here? -Not far. Just up that mountain.

318
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,240
-那里有电话吗  -是的
-Do they have a phone? -Yes.

319
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,010
好的 我们走
All right, let's hit it.

320
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,780
你确定我们被邀请去这个聚会了吗 
Dude, are you sure we're invited to this party?

321
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,760
当然了 迈尔斯 那是一个湖 是公共场所
Of course, Miles. It's a lake. Public property.

322
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,690
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

323
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,320
我的天啊 梅卡拉在这 你丫别发蠢 听见没
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here. Just don't do anything weird, all right?

324
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,990
-我看上去不错 对不对  -是的
-I'm good, right? -Yeah, you're good.

325
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,070
好的
Okay.

326
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,740

Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

329
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,610
你们来这里干什么 
So, what are you guys doing here?

330
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,220
我们来这里 爬上这棵树
We're here to climb this tree.

331
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,820
看见了 很有趣
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

332
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,390
-嗯  -我想我认识你
-Yeah. -You know, I thought I recognized you.

333
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,460
你去年参加过橄榄球队的预选 对吧
You tried out for the football team last year, right?

334
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,330
我们去找你的妈妈
Let's go call your mom.

335
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,330
不 不是 我并不是想参加预选
Oh, no, no, that... No. That wasn't like a real tryout.

336
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,130
我是在为写书收集资料
I was researching a book I was writing.

337
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,540
-是吗  -是的

Yeah? What's it about? Sucking at sports?

339
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,140
不 是关于橄榄球和脑损伤的
No, it's about the link between brain damage and football.

340
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,480
是本好书 你的朋友会喜欢它的
No, it's a good book. Your friends'll love it.

341
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,750
有上色的地方 立体折叠...
You know, it's got mazes in it and, you know, little coloring areas,

342
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,410
...还有图片 非常有趣
sections, pop-up pictures. It's a lot of fun.

343
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,220
真是好笑
That's funny.

344
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,020
不要这样
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

345
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,090
我们去参加聚会吧
Hey, guys, I know of a party. Let's go, let's head.

346

Just get out of the tree right now, please.

348
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,100
你在干什么 
What are you doing?

349
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,270
看见我的英姿了没 迷倒多少娘们
Did you see that dismount? All the chicks were watching.

350
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,810
蠢货 你丢死人了 搞得我们像白痴一样
You're making me look like an idiot. We both looked like idiots just now.

351
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,180
-让我试试手 行不  -当然不行 这可不是玩具车
-Hey, how about you let me drive? -Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

352
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,250
22英寸的轮胎 我不想给你开
These 22s, I don't want you grinding them. No.

353
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,340
我可爱的小白兔为什么不跳到后座上去
Why doesn't my little bunny just hop in the back seat?

354
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,690
我可不是你的小白兔
God, I can't even tell you how much I'm not your little bunny.

355
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,290
好吧
Okay.

356

你会来找我的
You'll call me.

357
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,500
今晚谁驱车送你回家
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

358
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,100
你的收音机怎么了 
Hey, man, what's wrong with your radio?

359
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,110
-我要送她回家  -什么 
-I'm gonna drive her home tonight. -What?

360
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,840
她可是个小骚货 伙计 让她去搭车吧
She's an evil jock concubine, man. Let her hitchhike.

361
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,570
她家离这里有10英里远 这是我唯一的机会
She lives 10 miles from here, okay? It's my only chance.

362
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,940
你要理解我 好吗
You got to be understanding here, all right?

363
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,450
把她放在后座 我会安静的
All right. We'll put her in the back. I'll be quiet.

364
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,180
-你是不是说 "让她坐在后座"  -我说坐前面
-Did you say, "Put her in the back"? -I called shotgun.

365
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,080
我不会让她坐后面 你得下车
I'm not putting her in the back. You got to get out of my car.

366
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,520
-这可违反了聚会规则  -什么规则 
-That's a party foul. -What rules?

367
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,820
不能重色轻友
Bros before hos.

368
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,690
迈尔斯 别搞了 快下去
Miles, I'm begging you to get out of my car. Okay?

369
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,780
你不能这样对我
You can't do this to me.

370
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,990
你必须下车
You got to get out of my car right now.

371
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,270
你受伤时谁陪在你身边 
Who's gonna come around when you break?

372
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,240
梅卡拉 我是山姆
Mikaela! It's Sam.

373
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,360
维特维奇
Witwicky.

374
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,040
希望没有让你觉得太尴尬
I hope I didn't get you stranded or anything.

375
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,110
是吧 
You sure?

376
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,970
我可不可以载你回家 
So, listen, I was wondering if I could ride you home.

377
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,540
我是说我开车送你回家
I mean, give you a ride home in my car, to your house.

378
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,780
上车吧
There you go.

379
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,890
那么...
So...

380
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,160
我真不敢相信我现在坐在这里
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

381
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,230
你可以把头低下 我不会感到难过的
You can duck down if you want. I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

382
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,360
我不是说和你在一块
Oh, no, no, no. I didn't mean here with you.

383
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,710
我是说现在这种状况 我总是这样
I just meant here, like, in this situation, this same situation that I'm always in.

384
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,800
我不知道 我想我是 对肌肉男有特殊的喜好
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just have a weakness for hot guys,

385
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,440
那种紧紧的肌肉 结实的臂膀

结实的臂膀 
Big arms?

387
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,850
这车上有些新东西
Well, there's a couple new additions in the car.

389
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,990
用来照射这个万花球
And that disco ball. And so the light reflects off the disco ball.

390

当欲望来时 性爱疗法是我所需
When I get that feeling I want sexual healing

407
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,070
这收音机 也是个二手的
This radio is, like, you know... It's an old radio, too, so...

408
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,880
性爱疗法
Sexual healing

409
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,210
我也不知道为什么
Look, this isn't something that I, you know...

410
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,290
我没法关掉收音机 我不是故意的
I can't get this radio to stop. Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

411
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,790
这有点罗曼蒂克 我不想这样的
Cause this is like a romantic thing that I'm not trying to do.

412
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,590
不应该对你这样的
Not that you're not worthy of trying something like this on.

413
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,020
-当然  -我是你的朋友
-No, of course not. -I'm a friend of yours.

414
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,460
不是个罗曼蒂克的朋友 罗曼蒂克的朋友才这样
I'm not a romantic friend. Romantic friends do this.

415
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,620
我是说 我不是那种朋友 我们...我可以是的
I mean, I'm not that friend. I mean, we... I could be.

416
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,230
我感觉不错
I feel good

417
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,730
打开引擎罩
Just pop the hood.

418
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,370
闭嘴 闭嘴
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

419
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,040
缸头真不错
Whoa, nice headers.

420
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,700
高置双泵渗碳缸头
You've got a high-rise double-pump carburetor.

421
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,210
印象深刻 山姆
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

422
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,540
双泵 
Double-pump?

423
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,340
汽油进的更快 速度也就可以更快
It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster.

424
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,110
我喜欢飚快车
I like to go faster.

425
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,160
看起来你的配电盘封盖有些松了
And it looks like your distributor cap's a little loose.

426
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,090
是吗 你是怎么知道的 
Yeah? How'd you know that?

427
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,220
我爸爸是个汽车机械师 他教我的
My dad. He was a real grease monkey. He taught me all about this.

428
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,770
我可以把整车拆成零件 清洗一下 再装起来
I could take it all apart, clean it, put it back together.

429
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,070
真奇怪 我一定不会花钱请你当修车工
That's weird. I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

430
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,160
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

431
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,830
你放心了 我不会说出去的
Well, you know, I don't really broadcast it.

432
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,970
男人不喜欢女人比他们更懂车
Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do.

433
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,710
特别是崔恩 他讨厌这些
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

434
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,680
女人来修引擎 我不介意的
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know, females working on my engine.

435
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,340
实际上 我挺喜欢
I prefer it, actually.

436
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,320
-你想试一下点火吗  -没问题
-Okay. You want to fire it up for me? -Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

437
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,620
-谢谢  -我在想
-Thanks. -You know, I was thinking.

438
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,160
如果崔恩是个混蛋 你为什么还和他在一起
You know, if Trent's such a jerk, why do you hang out with him?

439
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,020
嗯...我要走路回去了
You know what? I'm just... I'm gonna walk.

哦 上帝 别 别 别
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

拜托 快好起来吧
Come on, please. Please, you gotta work for me now.

445
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,280
不要让她走掉 拜托 求求你
Don't let her walk away. Come on, come on, come on. Please, please.

446
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,850
宝贝回来吧 傻瓜都看得出来
Baby come back any kind of fool could see

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,250
都是为了你
There was something in everything about you

449
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,450
宝贝回来吧 你可以怪我的
Baby come back you can blame it all on me

450
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,900

I had fun. So, you know, thanks for listening.

455
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,180
-嗯  -你是不是认为我很肤浅 
-Oh, yeah, yeah. -You... You think I'm shallow?

456
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,480
我觉得你...不 不 不
I think you're... No, no, no.

457
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,190
我觉得 你并非徒有其表
I think there's a lot more than meets the eye with you.

458
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,130
好的
Okay.

459
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,100

好的
All right.

462
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,280
真傻
That's stupid.

463
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,640
真傻的台词
That was a stupid line.

464
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,540
"你并非徒有其表" 真傻
"There's more than meets the eye with you." Stupid.

465
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,320
哦 上帝
Oh, God.

466
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,310
哦 上帝 我喜欢这车
Oh, my God. I love my car.

拜托 伙计 伊朗科学家没这么灵光的脑筋
Come on, man. This is way too smart for Iranian scientists.

469
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,510
-想想吧  -你觉得呢 是中国人? 
-Think about it. -What do you think, kid? Chinese?

470
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,210
不太像 这和中国所用的技术一点也不像
No way. This is nothing like what the Chinese are using.

00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,580
机组 准备紧急降落
Crew, prepare for emergency descent.

508
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,660
我要总统现在就进入地下掩体
I want our President in that bunker.

509
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,800
我要在他安全后再讨论现在这个问题
And I don't want to discuss a damn thing other till that becomes reality.

510
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,000
这是我们现在唯一的目标
That's our first priority. That's our only priority right now.

511
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,240
空军一号已经降落了
Air Force One is on the ground.

638
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,530
那些蠢虫想杀我

639
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,040
找到了火种源的线索

640
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,750
人类维特维奇 他见过我们的文字

641
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,620
搜索维特维奇

642
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,750
「用户名：猛男217」

643
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,770
我们一定要找到猛男217

512
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,970
哦 上帝 不 不 不 
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

513

516
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,020
爸爸 报警
Dad, call the cops!

517
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,930
你要开我的车去哪 
Where you going with my car, buddy? Where you going?

518
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,770
我要报警 我的车被偷了 
Hello? 911 emergency! My car has been stolen!

519
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,330
我正在追他 把所有人都叫来 
I'm in pursuit! Right? I need all units, the whole squadron.

520
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,240
把所有人都叫来 别问我问题
Bring everyone! No, don't ask me questions, all right?

521
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,010
我爸爸是邻居保安计划主管
My father's the head of the neighborhood watch!

522
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,210
哦 上帝
Oh, my God.

523
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,030
我叫山姆・维特维奇
My name is Sam Witwicky.

524
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,070
有幸看到这个的人 我的车变成活人了 瞧
Whoever finds this, my car is alive, okay? You saw that?

525
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,900
我的临终遗言 爸爸妈妈 我爱你们
Since this is my last words on Earth, I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

526
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,370
如果你们从床下找到色情杂志 那不是我的
and if you find Busty Beauties under my bed, it wasn't mine.

527
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,470
我是替迈尔斯保管的 不 等等...
I'm holding it for Miles. No, no, wait that...

528
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,210
色情书是我的 查尔叔叔给我的
Okay, that's not true. It's mine and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

529
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,280
对不起 小麻鸡 我爱你
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

530
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,090

533
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,400
哦 上帝
Oh, my God.

534
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:55,410
喔 好吧 好吧 
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh! No! No!

535
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,680
求求你 别杀我 
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

536
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,120
钥匙给你了 车我不要了 
I'm sorry! Take the keys! I don't want them! Car's yours!

537
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,360
听着 听着 听着
Listen, listen, listen.

538
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,790
-真好 你们来了  -把手举起来 
-Good, you're here. -Let me see your hands!

539
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,450
-不不不 不是我  -把手举起来让我看到
-No, no, no! It's not me! -Let me see your hands.

540
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,620
-那个人在里面  -住嘴 走向警车
-The guy's inside. -Shut up! Walk towards the car.

541
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,300
把头顶到引擎罩上
Put your head on the hood.

542
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,310
他们终于还是侵入了我们的防卫网
Whoever did this finally managed to infiltrate our defense network,

543
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,940
他们当时尝试侵入我们的卡塔尔基地 不过这次他们得逞了
which is what they tried to do in Qatar, only this time it worked.

544
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,680
-他们都弄到了什么  -目前还未知
-What did they get? -We still don't know.

545
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,920
-告诉我病毒的情况  -是一种蜘蛛型病毒
-Talk to me about the virus. -It's a Spider-bot virus.

546
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,660
我们还不了解它的作用 不过有可能会侵害我们的系统
We're not sure what it's going to do, but it may cripple the system.

547
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,750
-能不能杀干净?  -每次我们试图消灭它
-Can we stop it? -Every time we try an antivirus,

548
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,390
它就会变种躲避 好像不单纯是一种病毒了
it adapts and speeds up. It's like it's not a virus anymore.

549
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,560
变成了某种系统
It's become the system.

550
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,830
很明显 这是大规模反美攻击的第一阶段
Obviously the first phase of a major attack against the US.

551
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,530
有此能力的国家包括
The only countries with this kind of capability

552
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,940
俄罗斯 朝鲜 也许中国也帮忙了
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

553
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,980
-抱歉 我想事情不是这样的  -你说啥 女士?
-I'm sorry, that's not correct. -Excuse me, young lady.

554
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,310
我没留意你在场 你是... 
I didn't see you standing there. You would be who?

555
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,250
是我侦测到他们的攻击
I'm just the analyst who detected the hack.

556
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,480
等一下 是你侦测到的 
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

557
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,620
-她的团队  -长官 我只是想说明
-Her team. -Sir, I was just trying to say,

558
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,350
他们在10秒之内就攻破了我们的防火墙
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

559
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,120
就算是最尖端最具攻击性的计算机
Okay. Even a supercomputer with a brute force attack

560
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,960
也需要至少二十年的时间才能做到
would take 20 years to do that.

561
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,530
那么请你给我解释来听听 卫星显示
Maybe you can explain, then, how our latest satellite imagery

562
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,970
朝鲜确实加强了他们的国防力量 
shows North Korea doubling its naval activity.

563
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,560
也许这只是他们的防护措施 我们不是也一样 
Maybe it's a precaution, because isn't that what we're doing?

564
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,040
信号图像正在不断发展 他们具有自发进化的能力
The signal pattern is learning. It's evolving on its own.

565
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,410
这不是线性变换 所能解释的了
And you need to move past Fourier transfers

566
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,710
已经提升到量子力学的范畴
and start considering quantum mechanics.

567
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,150
好像地球上并不存在如此复杂的东西
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

568
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,740
那么有机体呢 具有生命能力的有机体
What about an organism? A living organism?

569
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,250
例如DNA构成的计算机 有生命的
Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer?

570
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,020
-我知道这个听起来是天方夜谭...  -够了 够了
-And I know that that sounds crazy... -That's enough. That's enough.

571
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,050
六层楼里的专家们 正在协力分析调查
We have six floors of analysts working on this thing.

572
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,490
如果你能找到证据来支持你的观点
Now, if you can find proof to back up your theory,

573
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,090
我乐意听取 可是如果你继续在这里信口开河
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you. But if you don't get a filter

574
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,140
我就只有请你走人 听清楚了?
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna be off the team. You understand?

575
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,050
我当时非常清醒 简直"清澈见底"
Look, I can't be any clearer than how crystal clear I am being.

576
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,310
-他就那么站起来了  -站了起来
-It just stood up. -It just stood up.

577
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,550
哇...好恐怖哦
Wow. That's really neat.

578
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,780
好吧 这个拿去
Okay, chiefie.

579
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,950
把这个灌满 别滴的到处都是
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

580
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,860
你嗑的什么药 
What are you rolling?

581
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,290
氧化亚氮 巴比妥盐 还是少许大麻?
Whippets? Goofballs? A little wowie sauce with the boys?

582
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,760
-我没有嗑药  -这是维生素阿?
-No, I'm not on any drugs. -What's these?

583
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,360
你口袋里找到的 "小麻鸡"
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

584
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,230
现在的古惑仔流行吃这个"小麻鸡"?
Is that what the kids are doing now? Little bit of Mojo?

585
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,970
-那是我狗狗的止痛药  -吉娃娃狗...
-Those are my dog's pain pills. -You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

586
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,210
怎么回事 
What was that?

587
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,050
盯着我的枪 你想当"50分"呢? (美国饶舌歌星 曾中9枪而不死)
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

588
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,680
想试试 那你就来试试看 
You wanna go? Make something happen. Do it.

589
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,990
我明确的告诉你 保证你开花
Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

590
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,620
你是不是药嗑多了?
Are you on drugs?

591
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,590
中东 卡塔尔

592
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,440
但愿这条电话线还管用
Let's hope this telephone line works.

593
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,440
嘿 抬头 
Hey, heads up!

594
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,180
抬头 嘿 抬头 
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

595
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,090
怎么回事 
What the heck was that?

596
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,090
小崽 说国语
English, dude. English.

597
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,630
喔 
Whoa!

598
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,800

00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,550
-打死它  -靠近了 靠近了 
-Open fire! -Contact! Contact!

600
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,710
大家安静
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

601
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,940

00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:36,690
躲避找掩护 菲格 埃普斯 你们断后
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear! Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

607

快 给我把机枪 
Come on! Give me a mag!

608
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,660
你爸爸呢 你爸爸呢 
Where's your papa? Where's your papa?

609
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,860
爸爸 
Papa!

610
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,730
先生 我们需要电话
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

611
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,210
-电话 电话 对  -电话

开火 
Fire!

615
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,140
帮我接五角大楼 紧急电话 听到吗 
This is an emergency Pentagon call! I need you to... Do you understand?

616
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,740
这是紧急...
It's an emergency Pentagon...

617
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,750
我没有信用卡 
I don't have a credit card!

618
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,950
先生 你的态度根本无法提高办事效率
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed things up any bit at all.

619
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,760
请你对着话筒把话说清楚
I'm going to ask you to speak into the mouthpiece very clearly.

620
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,160
我正在打仗 这真他妈荒唐 
I'm in the middle of a war! This is frigging ridiculous!

Also, sir, have you heard about our premium plus world-service gold package?

629
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,990
我不要什么扯蛋套餐 埃普斯 接五角大楼 
No, I don't want a premium package! Epps! Pentagon!

630
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,260

01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:32,280
我没事 伙计们 
I'm all right, lads!

888
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,090
要给你扔条绳子吗 船长 
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

889
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:48,570
威震天在拿到火种魔方之前 坠落到地球上了
Megatron crash-landed before he could retrieve the Cube.

890
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,610
伙计们 我们有个重大发现 
Men! We've made a discovery!

891
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,120
他无意中启动了它的导航系统
He accidentally activated his navigation system.

892
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:19,540
火种魔方在地球上的座标 由此印在了他的镜片上
The coordinates to the Cube's location on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

893
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,670
你怎么知道眼镜的 
How'd you know about his glasses?

894
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,010
-易趣网  -我的店铺
-EBay. -EBay.

895
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:27,280
如果霸天虎们找到了火种源
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

896
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:33,220
他们就会用它的能量转换地球上的机器 建立新的军队
they will use its power to transform Earth's machines and build a new army.

897
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,720
届时人类便会灭亡
And the human race will be extinguished.

898
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:42,290
山姆・维特维奇 地球的存亡就掌握在你的手上了
Sam Witwicky, you hold the key to Earth's survival.

899
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,470
眼镜还在你那儿吧 
Please tell me that you have those glasses.

900
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,470
大西洋上空

901
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:55,840
这简直就是个能自我修复的装甲
It's like a self-regenerating molecular armor.

902
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:59,310
看看脱壳穿甲弹打的弹孔 直穿而过
Look at the scorch mark where the sabot round hit.Melted right through.

903
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:02,610
穿甲弹是不是可以产生6000度的高温
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like, a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

904
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,950
很接近 能熔化坦克装甲
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

905
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,250
因此他的金属表面一定会在 极高温下有反应
So this metal skin must react to extreme heat.

906
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,650
-注意  -啊 
-Heads up! -Oh!

907
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:13,050
你不是说这鬼东西已经死了吗 
I thought you said that thing was dead, man!

908
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,190
绑住他 捆绑住 这东西很邪门 
Strap it down! Strap it! This thing is wicked.

909
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,630
好的 联系北方司令部
All right, get on the horn with Northern Command.

910
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,000
告诉他们我们的有效武器是高温穿甲弹
Tell them that our effective weapon is high-heat sabot rounds.

911
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,570
建议所有的直升机都配备这种弹药 去吧 
Recommend we load them on all the gunships. Go.

912
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,500
这块你要不要 
You want that piece?

913
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:32,910
玛吉 你听我说 我告诉你接下来会怎样
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break it down to you how it's gonna happen.

914
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:35,070
等下进来的家伙 一个唱黑脸 一个唱白脸
They gonna come through that door and be good cop, bad cop.

915
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,510
别中圈套 所以我才吃这些东西
Don't fall for that, all right? That's why I ate their food.

916
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,180
他们把吃的放这儿 是要试探你是不是心虚
See, they put the plate of donuts out here to test your guilt.

917
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,750
如果你不吃 就说明你心虚
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

918
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:47,690
所以我整盘都吃啦 整盘 
I ate the whole plate. The whole plate. Okay?

919
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,950
就咱俩
It's me and you.

920
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,890
他们进来时 你什么也别说
They walk through that door, you don't say nothing.

921
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,970
我举报 都是她干的 她才是你们要抓的人 
She did it! She did it! She's the one you want! All right?

922
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,710
我只是在家看卡通片
I was just sitting at home watching cartoons,

923
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,810
还有跟我堂弟玩游戏而已 然后她闯了进来
playing video games with my cousin, and she came in there.

924
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,880
-然后...  -格伦 你个杂种
-And then... -Glen, you freak.

925
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,220
我才不会因为你或任何人去坐牢 
Hey! I am not going to jail for you or anybody else!

926
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:21,020
我这辈子从来没干过坏事 老兄 我还是童子身呢 
I have done nothing bad my entire life! Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

927
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,090
童子 那又怎样 
Okay, so what?

928
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,290
是啊 我是从互联网上下载了几千首歌
I've downloaded a couple of thousand songs off the Internet.

929
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,090
可是谁没有呢 
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

930
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,160
-我发誓  -格伦 闭嘴 
-I promise! -Glen, shut up!

931
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:31,100
你才闭嘴 别跟我说话 不要跟我说话 你这个坏人
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me, criminal!

932
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,500
-啊 给糖甜昏头了我  -不是 不是他的错
-Oh, sugar rush. -This is... This is not his fault.

933
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:37,200
她都说了 我能回家了吗 
See? So can I go home now?

934
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,540
-好吧 我不会了  -请你 请你听我说
-Oh, okay. I won't. -But just listen to me.

935
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,340
不管是谁黑了你们的防卫系统 并且下载了一个文件
Okay, whoever hacked into your military system downloaded a file, all right?

936
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,780
应该是跟一个名叫维特维奇的人有关
It was something about someone named Witwicky

937
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,480
还有一个政府组织 叫做第七防区组织
and some government group, right? Named Sector Seven.

938
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:51,320
请你让我先跟国防部长谈谈
You have to let me talk to Defense Secretary Keller

939
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,720
否则你们很可能会误伤不该激怒的国家
before you go to war with the wrong country!

940
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,660
"不管天上掉了什么 它就落在..."
Whatever fell out of the sky ended up right behind...

941
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,350

01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:02,590
-他说是什么  -他以为是军事实验
-What does he think it is? -He thinks it's a military experiment.

944
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,100
-简直不知所谓  -对 我觉得是一架飞机...
-What a knucklehead. -Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

945
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,310
"目前官方尚未发布任何意见..."
Still no official word as to what happened. You can see...

946
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,600
-嗯  -打电话给山姆
-Yeah! -Call Sam.

947

If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late and you'll have to ground him.

950
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,040
如果他没有晚 我就不能禁他 对吧 
Well, I can't ground him if he's not late, can I?

951
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,760

1015
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,590
眼镜在袋子里
My glasses were in the bag.

1016
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,530
袋子在我背包里 但背包不在这里
They were in the backpack and now the backpack isn't here.

1017
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,190
他们肯定不会高兴的 现在怎么办 
Well, they're gonna be pissed, so what do you wanna do?

1018
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,360
我觉得你应该...
So what I think you should do is you should...

1019
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:26,660
你应该清查下整个... 这里每个角落
You should check this whole... This whole section here.

1020
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:29,710
你帮我仔细找找 我找这边的角落
Just give it a clean sweep, and I'll get the corner here.

1021
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:32,240

-对不起 没什么  -你只是...
-Sorry. That's nothing. -You just...

-You just told me to look... -I know,

1024
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,310
但我没叫你翻我的藏宝箱
but I didn't mean to look inside of my treasure chest.

1025
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:39,110
你应该讲清楚 不然我又会找错地方...
You should be way more specific so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1026
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,150
我已经都快崩溃了
I'm already stressed out enough.

1027

No. No, no. No, no, no.

1029
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:52,650
这算什么躲藏 这里是我家后院 可不是公路休息站
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding. This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1030
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,750
啊 上帝 啊 
Oh, God. Oh!

1031
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:57,990
我看到有不明飞行物体在此着陆 但现在不见了
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed right here and now it's gone.

1032
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,400
我的摩托给压成饼干了 伙计 谁来赔我钱 
My moped's under there, man! Who's gonna pay for that?

1033
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:03,600
山姆 山姆

What? Oh, no, no, no.

1036
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,500

1037
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:10,840
听着 听我说
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1038
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,940
如果我父母出来看到了你们 他们会吓坏了的
If my parents come out here and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1039
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,520
我妈脾气很不好
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1040
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,180
我们必须拿到那副眼镜
We must have the glasses.

1041
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:17,850
我知道你需要那副眼镜 我已经找遍所有地方
I know you need the glasses. I've been looking everywhere.

1054
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:41,210
他要我们安静
He wants us to be quiet.

1055
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:48,850

开灯干什么 把灯关掉
What's with the light? You gotta stop the light.

-关掉  -山姆 你在里面吗 
-Shut it off. -Sam, are you in there?

1069
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,300
为何门是锁着的
How come the door's locked?

1070
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:29,040
你知道规矩的 不许在这家里锁门
You know the rules. No doors locked in my house!

1071
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:30,340
你再不开门
You know he'll start counting

1072

-他就要开始倒数了  -最后一次机会 5...

-What's up? What's with the bat? -Who were you talking to?

1079
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,790
-跟你们呀  -你怎么又臭又脏的 
-I'm talking to you. -Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1080
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,490
我年轻啊 你懂得 青少年
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1081
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,830
我们听到有人声和噪音 我们以为你...
We heard voices and noises and we thought maybe you were...

1082
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,800
我们怎么想不重要 刚才那灯光是什么 
It doesn't matter what we thought. What was that light?

1083
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,700
没阿 什么灯光? 没有灯光阿 老爸 你看花眼了
No, what light? What? There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1084
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,300
你们手上不就有两个手电筒 光是从你们这里来的
You got two lights in your hand! That's what it is.

1085
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,670
-或许就这么反射...  -光是从门缝里出来的
-Maybe it bounced... -There was light under the door.

1086
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,800
你们...你们不能就这么闯进我的房间里来
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce into my room like that.

1087
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:01,280
你应该先敲门 先沟通
You got to knock. You got to communicate.

1088
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,400
-我们敲了5分钟了  -我长大了
-We knocked for five minutes. -I'm a teenager.

-You were screaming at me, okay? -No.

1091
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:06,980
你们过分干涉我了
This is repression, what you're doing here.

1092
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,450
-你们在蹂躏我的青春 知道吗  -哦 老天啊
-You're ruining my youth, okay? -Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1093

你太过激了 你在手淫吗 
You are so defensive! Were you masturbating?

1094
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,950

1097
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:20,590
那不是你该管的
That's not something for you to bring up.

1098
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,220
-那是父子间的对话 好不好  -父与子的私事
-That's a father-and-son thing, okay? -Father-son thing.

1099
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,170
我是说如果你不喜欢这个词的话
I mean, you don't have to call it that word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1100
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,900
你可以称它为"山姆的快乐时间"
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1101
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:31,000
-快乐时间  -或"我特别的私人时间"

I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1109
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:49,120

-Where? -Come on, get out of that tub.

1116
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,530
你不觉得保命很重要的 
Can't you take safety seriously?

1117

Judy? Better call the city. We got a blown transformer!

1120
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,110
电杆火星四射...天哪
Power pole's sparking all over the place!

1121
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,450
院子被毁了
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1122
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,250
一塌糊涂 完了
Trashed. Gone.

1123
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,030
-成洼地了 整个花园  -你开玩笑
-It's a wash. The whole yard. -You're kidding.

1124

-是啊 是啊  -我能不能处理掉他们 
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Can I take them out?

1126

Ironhide, you know we don't harm humans.

1127
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,100
你在想什么 
What is with you?

1128
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,540

Well, I'm just saying we could. It's an option.

1129
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,300
我们听到你和别人在说话 山姆

你帮我分散我父母的注意
I want you to distract my parents

1141
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,220

while I slip out and get these glasses to them, okay?

1142
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,720
-罗纳德・维奇提  -是维特维奇 你是谁 
-Ronald Wickity? -It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1143
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:32,860
我们是政府机关 第七防区的
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1144
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,090
-从来没听过  -以后也不会
-Never heard of it. -Never will.

1145
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,730
你儿子是阿奇伯尔德・维奇提的曾孙子 对不对 
Your son's the great-grandson of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

是维特维奇
It's Witwicky.

1147

我能进屋吗 先生 
May I enter the premises, sir?

1148
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,340
荣恩 前院有好多人
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1149
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,410
到底是怎么回事 
What the heck is going on here?

1150
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,640
你儿子昨晚举报有人偷车
Your son filed a stolen car report last night.

1151
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,010
我们认为这关系到国家的安全
We think it's involved in a national security matter.

1152
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,550
-他们在拔我的玫瑰  -国家安全 
-They're ripping up my rose bushes! -National security?

1153
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,710
没错 国家安全
That's right. National security.

1154
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:55,410
天哪 荣恩 到处都是他们的人
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

There's guys in suits all around the house! Look at this!

1156
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:59,790
可不可以别踩我的草坪
Could you stay off the grass?

1157
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:01,330
给我采取一些同位素的样本
Get me a sample and some isotope readings.

1158
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:03,050
他们把树都拔了 
They're pulling bushes out of the ground!

1159
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,390
老天 不许他们碰我的花 
Good Lord! They've got to get their hands off my bush!

1160
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,970
-请放下你的球棒 女士  -喂喂喂 那是我的...
-Drop the bat, ma'am. -Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1161
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:09,400
我可是带着武器的
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1162
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,830
你最好叫你的人离开我的花园
But you'd better get those guys out of my garden

1163
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:13,100
否则我会狠狠修理他们
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1164
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,230
你是否有流感的症状 关节疼痛 发烧 
Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1165
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,400
-没有  -怎么回事 
-No! -What is this?

1166
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:21,240
你好呀 小子 你叫山姆吗 
How you doing, son? Is your name Sam?

1167
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:22,810
-是啊  -那你得跟我们走一趟
-Yeah. -Well, I need you to come with us.

1168
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,140
喂 那可不行
Whoa, way out of line.

1169
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:28,280
先生 我这已经很客气了 退下
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1170
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:30,290
-你不能带我儿子走  -是吗 
-You're not taking my son. -Really?

1171
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:31,450
想和我们硬碰硬 
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1172
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,750
不 但我会打电话报警
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1173
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:35,050
这件事太点蹊跷
because there's something fishy going on around here.

1174
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,860
没错 你 你儿子...
Yeah. There's something a little fishy about you, your son,

1175
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,920
还有扣皮带的狗 整个组织都有蹊跷
your little Taco Bell dog and this whole operation you got going on here.

1176
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:44,260
-什么组织  -我们接下来就知道了
-What operation? -That is what we are gonna find out.

1177
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:46,930
我认为是直接接触
I think direct contact.

1178
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:53,940
-孩子  -嗯
-Son? -Yeah.

1179
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:57,920
-请上前来  -站着就行 
-Step forward, please. -Just stand?

1180
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,160
14单位
Fourteen rads.

1181
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,230
找对人了 把他们贴上标签卷走
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1182
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,860
你敢伤害我的狗 我揣烂你屁股
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1183
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,660
尽快取得植被上的样本
Get me a sample on that vegetation ASAP!

1184
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,290
山姆 不要开口
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1185
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,270
-好的  -在律师来前一个字都别说 
-Yeah. -Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1186
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:21,700
好了
So,

1187
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:26,600
万人迷先生217
LadiesMan217.

1188
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:30,150
那是你的易趣帐号名称 对吧
That is your eBay username, right?

1189
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,580
对 我打错字了 不过就将错就错
Yeah, but, you know, it was a typo and I ran with it.

1190
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:33,650
那这是什么 
What do you make of this?

1191
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:36,310
我叫山姆・维特维奇 知道吗 我的车...
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay? And my...

1192
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,550
那是你吗 
Is that you?

1193
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,850
是啊 那听起来像万人迷先生
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1194
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,790
昨晚在警局你说你的车变形了
Last night at the station, you told the officer your car transformed.

1195
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:48,460
-能不能解释一下  -你听我说 好吗 
-Enlighten me. -Well, here's what I said, okay?

1196
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:53,030
我车被偷的这一切都是个误会
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding that my car had been stolen...

1197
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,270
-是吗  -...从我手上 从家里...
-Really? ...from me, from my home,

1198
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:58,340
但现在没事了 因为它回来了 已经回来了
but it's fine now because it's back! It came back!

1199
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,170
-不是自己回来的  -当然不是
-Well, not by itself. -Well, no.

1200
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,720
因为车子不会自己回来 因为那太荒唐了 
Because cars don't do that because that would be crazy.

1201
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,440
真好笑 好笑
That's funny. That is so funny.

1202
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,050
你们两个对外星人了解多少 
So what do you kids know about aliens, huh?

1203
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:14,990
你说火星人 ET? 不知道
Oh, you mean, like a Martian? Like what, E. T? No.

1204
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,580
-那只是个传说  -是啊
-It's an urban legend. -Yeah.

1205
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:17,820
知道这是什么吗 
You see this?

1206
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,520
有了这个徽章 我就可以为所欲为
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want and-get-away-with-it badge.

1207
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:23,400
-这样  -我要把你们永远关起来
-Right. -I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1208
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,730
老天 我告诉你 别听他的
Oh, God. You know what? Don't listen to him.

1209
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,240
他生气是因为他回去后 就得去作购物中心的保安
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to get back to guarding the mall.

1210
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:30,400
你这穿着运动胸罩的 别惹我
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1211
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,600
尤其你爸的假释期快到了
Especially with your daddy's parole coming up.

1212
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,110
什么 假释期 
What? Parole?

1213
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:37,550
-没什么...  -偷车大盗还不算什么?
-It's nothing. -Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1214
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:39,640
是这样 我爸以前教我修的车
You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix?

1215
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,480
并不...并不全是他的
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1216
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,680
你们偷车 
You stole cars?

1217
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,480
以前有些时候 请不起保姆
Well, we couldn't always afford a babysitter,

1218
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,390
那时他就会带我一起去
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1219
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:48,790
她也有少年犯罪前科的
She's got her own juvie record to prove it!

1220
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:51,520
她是个罪犯 火辣的罪犯
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1221
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:57,300
因为你不合作而让他 下半辈子待在监狱不太好吧 
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot in jail the rest of his natural life.

1222
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,700
该说实话了
It is time to talk!

1223
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,880
好大
Big! It's big!

1224
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,590
快 快 快 快 
Go, go, go, go!

1225
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:17,650
-我看不到 我看不到  -你们把重心朝前 
-I can't see it! I can't see it! -Shift your weight towards the front!

1226
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,190
够了 够了 
All right! All right!

1227
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:36,070
鸡巴们 你们麻烦大了
You Ass-holes are in trouble now.

1228
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,710
先生们 让我向你们介绍 我的朋友...
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my friend,

1229
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,670
擎天柱
Optimus Prime.

1230
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:48,720
带走这些孩子是错误的选择
Taking the children was a bad move.

1231
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,220
汽车人 卸下他们的武器
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1232
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:57,560
不要动 
Freeze!

1233
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,600
拿来吧
-Whoa! Whoa! -Give me those!

1234
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:15,380
你好
Hi, there.

1235
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,410
你好像不怕我们 难道你们看到我们不觉得惊讶吗 
You don't seem afraid. Are you not surprised to see us?

1236
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:26,060
第七防区有规定 知道吗 
Look, there are S-Seven protocols, okay?

1237
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:27,960
我不允许和你交流
I'm not authorized to communicate with you

1238
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,290
不过除了告诉你 "我不能和你交流"
except to tell you I can't communicate with you.

1239
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,990
-下车  -好的
-Get out of the car. -All right.

1240
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,760
-我 你要我...  -下车 
-Me? You want me to get... -Now!

1241
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:36,360
好的好的 下车
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1242
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:39,840
好了 我在下了 在下了 看到没 
All right, I'm... I'm getting out. I'm getting out. You see?

1243
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:43,430
能那么放下我们却不让我们受伤 不错
Very nifty how you put us down without really killing us.

1244
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,070
你对手铐也很在行吧 
You're good with handcuffs, too, now, huh?

1245
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,170
你们好吗 
How you doing?

1246
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,010
-你不应该知道那些的  -大伙好吗 
-You weren't supposed to hear all that. -How's it going, huh?

1247
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:50,280
-是啊  -这都是真的
-Yeah. -This is real.

1248
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:53,550
听好 如果我准备和他开战 "妈妈"就是密语 知道吗 
Now, listen. If I choose to engage with him, mum is the word, all right?

1249
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:57,420
山姆 我那前科是因为我不肯供出我爸
Sam, I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1250
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:02,190
在你完美的人生里 有过不得不作出牺牲的时候吗
When have you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life?

1251
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,420
大家伙 拿大炮的大家伙 嗯 
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1252
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:08,400
第七防区是什么 回答我
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1253
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,990
这里有权利发问的是我 不是你 小伙子 
I'm the one who asks questions around here. Not you, young man!

1254
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,330
-你怎么知道外星人的事  -你把我父母带到哪去了 
-How'd you know about the aliens? -Where did you take my parents?

1255
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,430
-我无权和你们讨论这些  -是吗 
-I am not at liberty to discuss it. -No?

1256
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,410
你要是碰我 就触犯了联邦法律
Hey. You touch me, that's a federal offense.

1257
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:19,240
为所欲为的徽章 是吗 
Do-whatever-you-want and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1258
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:22,180
不要以为你现在有外星人撑腰 就大胆起来了
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with his big alien friend standing over there.

1259
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:25,480
-第七防区在哪儿  -你们不想知道 
-Where is Sector Seven? -Wouldn't you like to know?

1260
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,720
喂 
Hey!

1261
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:34,760
大黄蜂 停止润滑他
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1262
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:36,920
别闹了 好不好 
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1263
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:41,560
-好了 猛男 开始脱吧  -什么意思 
-All right, tough guy, take it off. -What are you talking about?

1264
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:44,360
-你的衣服 全脱了  -为什么 
-Your clothes, all of it, off. -For what?

1265
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,440
因为你威胁我爸
For threatening my dad.

1266
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:56,410
小姑娘 这是你生命终结的序曲
Little lady, this is the beginning of the end of your life.

1267
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,850
你是个罪犯
You're a criminal.

1268
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,320
面对现实吧 上梁不正下梁歪
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1269
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:07,620
不错啊 站到路灯后面
Those are nice. Now get behind the pole.

1270
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:08,720
知道了
All right.

1271
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:10,920
你们这样做犯了很严重的罪
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1272
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,870
-我会抓到你的  -他抓到你的
-I will hunt you down, okay? -He'll hunt you down.

1273
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,160
-不会心软的  -不会
-Without any remorse! -No remorse.

1274
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:18,530
-呆这吧  -好了 
-Enjoy. -Okay?

1275
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:23,070
-我们必须通知所有人  -他们已经知道了 扩音器模式
-We have got to alert everyone. -They already know. Speaker.

1276
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,550
擎天柱 敌人入侵 
Optimus! Incoming!

1277
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:40,490
出发
Roll out.

1278
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,730
我在那桥下测出有辐射反映
Okay, I'm picking up rad readings under that bridge right down there.

1279
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:57,010
辐射反映很强 超过42个单位
Okay, I'm getting really good rad readings. Forty-two and higher.

1280
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:58,440
上来
Up you get.

1281
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:05,120
好了 我们要行动了
Okay, we're dropping in.

1282
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:11,750
我们下方辐射指数很高 他在那儿
Really strong readings right down below us. There he is.

1283
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:14,020
1号和2号船 到这儿来
Ship one and two, come on in.

1284
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:17,720
看到了 在那儿 锁定他 锁定他
That's it, right there. Mark him, mark him.

1285
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:21,100
他在那儿 正前方偏左 正下方
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30. Right off the nose.

1286
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,190
看到了 正前方
I got it. 12:00.

1287
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:28,710
好了 我在跟踪她 找到了
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1288
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,870
他正沿着街道移动
Got him going down the street.

1289
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:42,050
他去哪儿了 我找不到他 失去红外信号 他去哪儿了 
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him. Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?

1290
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:44,550
信号丢失 信号丢失
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.

1291
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,120
我们这就赶过去
Okay, we're coming around.

1292
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:11,340
小心点 你们俩
Easy, you two.

1293
01:26:20,730 --> 01:26:23,960
不 不 山姆 山姆 别放手
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1294
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:27,620
山姆 不要 我在往下滑 
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping! I'm slipping!

1295
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:30,930
-抓住  -不要
-Hold on! -No!

1296
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,870
山姆 
Sam!

1297
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,610
我们找到了他了 目标锁定在河上
All right, we've got him pinned. We've got him pinned in the river.

1298
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,980
进入射击范围
I'm in for the shot.

1299
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:47,520
住手 住手 
Stop! Stop!

1300
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,520
等等 不要 
Wait! No!

1301
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:56,490
-射击 抓住他  -射击
-Take the shot, get him. -Take the shot.

1302
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,260
不要 
No!

1303
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:16,440
不要 住手 
No! Stop!

1304
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,350
住手 
Stop!

1305
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:22,390
趴在地上 趴下 
Get down on the ground! Get down! Get down!

1306
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:24,720
什么 好的
What? Okay.

1307
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:28,750
看啊 他没有还手
Look, he's not fighting back!

1308
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,560
冻住它 冻住它 
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1309
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,490
不要伤害他 
Stop hurting him!

1310
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:50,610
让他别动 
Don't let him move!

1311
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:52,910
我抓住他了
I got him here!

1312
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:17,170
不要 
No!

1313
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,980
看到我开不开心 
Happy to see me again?

1314
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,210
把他和他的罪犯朋友关到车子里
Put him in a car with his little criminal friend.

1315
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:36,150
把那东西冷冻起来准备运送
I want that thing frozen and ready for transport!

1316
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,600
退后 我去侦查一下
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1317
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,840
老大
Optimus,

1318
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,650
我们就待在这儿什么都不做?
are we just gonna stand here and do nothing?

1319
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:59,440
我们没办法营救大黄蜂而不伤害人类
There's no way to free Bumblebee without harming the humans.

1320
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:02,350
-可他是自家兄弟...  -让他们走吧
-But it's not right. He... -Let them leave.

1321
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:17,960
中国和俄国 非常接近我们的西太平洋作战区
The Chinese and the Russians are nearing our area of operations in the western Pacific.

1322
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:20,270
这局势我们控制不了多久
We feel like this could get out of hand real fast.

1323
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:23,140
接下来数小时就看他们总统怎么做了
But the next couple of hours may just define his presidency.

1324
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:31,790
中国舰队已经进入 巡航导弹射程100海里以内
US and Chinese task forces approaching 100 nautical miles of cruise missile range.

1325
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,410
告诉航母指挥官 除非对方先进攻 否则保持沉默
Tell the strike group commander that he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1326
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,490
-是的 长官  -部长先生 
-Yes, sir! -Mr. Secretary?

1327
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:44,960
我是第七防区先进研究部的汤姆・班尼切克
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven, Advanced Research Division.

1328
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:48,260
从没听说过 我现在很忙 汤姆 我想你也看得出来
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom. I think you can see that.

1329
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,890
-怎么回事  -不知道
-What's going on here? -I don't know.

1330
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:00,210
情况通报员 出来说句话 
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1331
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:02,710
-整间作业都中断了 先生  -我知道 
-The whole room's gone down, sir. -I can see that!

1332
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:04,480
病毒是用来中断所有作业的
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1333
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,020
-将军  -我坐在那里等
-General? -I'll take a seat.

1334
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:09,020
中止作业是什么意思 
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1335
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,110
它们利用我们的网络把病毒散布出去
They used our network to spread out to the whole world.

1336
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:13,320
全球性的网络
The blackout's global.

1337
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:16,260
我们与全球的卫星 互联网连接都中断了
We have no communications, satellite and land lines are dead.

1338
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:20,890
你意思是 我无法用这台电话打回家? 
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick up this telephone and call my family?

1339
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:31,140
部长先生 我是奉总统之命而来
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under direct order from the President.

1340
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,510
你需要看看我这手提箱里的东西
You really need to see what I have in the case.

1341
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,140
你必须知道有些事情
You'll have to accept that there are certain things

1342
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:42,350
你无法立即了解
you won't understand right away.

1343
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:45,790
第七防区是政府内一个特殊部门
Sector Seven is a special-access division of the government

1344
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:49,290
80年前奉胡佛总统之密令成立
convened in secret under President Hoover 80 years ago.

1345
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,260
您可能记得太空总署和喷推实验室 在火星上损失了猎犬二号机器人
You may remember NASA JPL lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1346
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:59,630
我们告诉他们将整件任务宣告失败 其实不然
We told them to report the mission a complete failure. It wasn't.

1347
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:02,510
猎犬二号传输了十三秒钟的影像
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1348
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,630
这是比最高机密还要机密的
This was classified above top secret.

1349
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:23,250
电子活动在170小时48分后停止
EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.

1350
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,990
火星上不是只有石头
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1351
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,360
这是火星上传来的影像
This is the image from Mars.

1352
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:34,830
这是您的特种部队 在基地被袭击时拍得的影像
Here's the image your Special Ops team was able to retrieve from the base attack.

1353
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:38,700
我们相信这是相同的外骨骼结构
We believe they are of the same exoskeletal type,

1354
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:42,340
很显然并非俄国或朝鲜能有的
and obviously not Russian or North Korean.

1355
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:45,410
你是说外星人入侵?
Are we talking about an invasion?

1356
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,610
我们拦劫了您的特种部队传来的讯息
We intercepted the message from your Special Ops team.

1357
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:52,050
那些东西知道他们也能被我方武器损伤的
These things can be hurt by our weapons and now they know it.

1358
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,890
所以他们用病毒使军事指挥陷入瘫痪
That's why the virus shut us down,

1359
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:57,290
好让我们无法组织防备他们下一波攻击
so we can't coordinate against their next attack,

1360
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,890
我敢用我的政府薪金打赌 下一波攻击绝对会很快来临
which I would bet my ridiculous government salary is coming soon.

1361
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,100
用国民警卫队的频道通知舰队指挥官
Get word to our fleet commanders over the National Guard frequency.

1362
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:11,610
那是短波 可能还有作用
It's a shortwave radio channel. It might be still working.

1363
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:15,040
叫他们调转船头 迅速赶回来
Tell them to turn their ships around and come home. ASAP!

1364
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:18,120
通知各司令部 抵抗即将发生的攻击
And inform all commands to prepare for imminent attack.

1365
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:22,590
内利斯空军基地

1366
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:31,590
兰诺克斯上尉 请带你的部队跟我们来 
Captain Lennox, we need you and your team to come with us right now!

1367
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,660
我们走 
Let's go!

1368
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,190
她在这里
She's in here.

1369
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,230
怎么回事 
What's going on?

1370
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,600
你跟我来
You're coming with me.

1371
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:46,740
-你来做我的顾问  -我也要去 
-You're going to be my advisor. -Me, too?

1372
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,080
他是谁 
Who's this?

1373
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:52,940
-他是我的顾问  -那 也来
-He's my advisor. -He comes, too.

1374
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:06,720
-那么...  -他们要你们来做什么 
-So... -What'd they get you for?

1375
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:12,070
我买了辆车...结果是个外星机器人
I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot.

1376
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,140
帅
Wow.

1377
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:14,930
谁知道呢
Who knew?

1378
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,620
走直线 小心你身后 
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1379
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:47,170
拜托 希望有用
Please, let this work.

1380
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:50,470
启动吧 老大
Fire it up, Optimus.

1381
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,930
代码
The code.

1382
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:58,450
眼镜里的代码显示火种源 在离这里230哩远处
The code on these glasses indicates the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1383
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:04,050
我感觉到霸天虎已准备开始行动了
I sense the Decepticons are getting ready to mobilize.

1384
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:06,990
他们一定也知道火种源在这里
They must know it's here, as well.

1385
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:08,420
大黄蜂怎么办 
What about Bumblebee?

1386
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:12,590
我们不能就这么眼睁睁的被他们当作试验品
We can't just leave him to die and become some human experiment!

1387
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:16,690
如果我们不完成任务的话他的牺牲就白费了
He'll die in vain if we don't accomplish our mission.

1388
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,030
大黄峰是名勇敢的战士 这会是他所希望的
Bumblebee is a brave soldier. This is what he would want.

1389
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:24,070
为何我们为拯救人类而战 
Why are we fighting to save the humans?

1390
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,840
他们是个原始且残暴的种族
They're a primitive and violent race.

1391
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,170
我们以前不也是吗 
Were we so different?

1392
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:38,450
他们是个年轻的种族 还有很多要学
They're a young species. They have much to learn.

1393
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,360
但我看到过他们的优点
But I've seen goodness in them.

1394
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:45,620
自由是所有有情感的生物之希望
Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.

1395
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:49,960
你们都知道结束这战争只有一个方法
You all know there's only one way to end this war.

1396
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:52,760
我们必须消灭火种魔方
We must destroy the Cube.

1397
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:58,130
如果其它方法都失败的话 我会将它与我胸中之火光结合
If all else fails, I will unite it with the spark in my chest.

1398
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,570
那是自杀行为
That's suicide.

1399
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:03,480
火种魔方的能源非常不稳定 你会和他同归于尽的
The Cube is raw power. It could destroy you both.

1400
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:08,040
为了这星球的和平 牺牲在所难免
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace to this planet.

1401
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:11,450
我们不能让人类为我们的错误而偿命
We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes.

1402
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,620
很荣幸与你们共战至今
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1403
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:19,530
-汽车人 变形出发  -变形出发 
-Autobots, roll out! -We rolling!

1404
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:34,740
立正 敬礼 
Team attention! Present arms!

1405
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:39,650
稍息 上尉 得到你的情报了 干得好
At ease. Captain, Sergeant. Got your intel. Excellent work.

1406
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:41,450
谢谢 炮艇机呢 
Thank you, sir. What about the gunships?

1407
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:43,680
所有炮艇机上加装了脱壳穿甲弹
They're being retrofitted with sabot rounds now.

1408
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:45,050
如果他们再来袭击 没问题的
If they hit us again, we'll be ready for them.

1409
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:48,250
不恢复全球的通讯可不行啊
But it won't do us much good if we can't get world communications back up.

1410
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,990
嘿 小子
Hey, kid.

1411
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:54,730
我想我们之前有点误会
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1412
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:56,360
你一定饿了吧 
You must be hungry?

1413
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:58,460
要不要来杯拿铁咖啡 或者2份超大的玛琪朵咖啡如何 
You want a latte? HoHo? Double venti macchiato?

1414
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,200
我的车呢 
Where's my car?

1415
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:03,870
小子 你仔细听好
Son, I need you to listen to me very carefully.

1416
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:06,070
这里人们的生命有危险
People can die here.

1417
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:09,140
你必须马上告诉我们你所知道的
We need to know everything you know. We need to know it now.

1418
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:10,440
好吧
Okay.

1419
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:14,280
但你得先把我的车 我父母还我 全部要书面保证
But first, I'll take my car, my parents. Maybe you should write that down.

1420
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:19,090
还有 她的前科也必须删除 永久地
Oh, and her juvie record. That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1421
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:23,690
跟我来 我们谈谈你的车
Come with me. We'll talk about your car.

1422
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,090
谢谢
Thank you.

1423
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,290
这家伙真是个职业勒索犯
The man's an extortionist.

1424
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,370
情况是这样的
All right, here's the situation.

1425
01:36:31,470 --> 01:36:33,870
你们都曾直接接触过NBEs
You've all had direct contact with the NBEs.

1426
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:35,060
说国语
NBEs?

1427
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:38,770
"非生物类外星生命体" 记清楚了
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials. Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1428
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,510
你们即将看到的是最高度机密
What you're about to see is totally classified.

1429
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:52,260
天啊 这是什么 
Dear God. What is this?

1430
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:53,520
天啊 这是什么 
Dear God. What is this?

1431
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:58,360
我们认为 当他飞越北极时
We think when he made his approach over the north pole,

1432
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:01,900
地球极点的磁极 扰乱了他的导航系统
our gravitational field screwed up his telemetry.

1433
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,990
他坠落到冰层里 大概是几千年前的事
He crashed in the ice, probably a few thousand years ago.

1434
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,370
我们在1934年将它运送到这里
We shipped him here to this facility in 1934.

1435
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:11,870
我们称它为NBE-1
We call him NBE One.

1436
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:14,340
抱歉 先生 不是我想故意喷你
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you on everything you think you know,

1437
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:16,850
他叫 威震天
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1438
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,950
他是霸天虎的阵营领袖
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1439
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:23,380
它自从1935年就处在冰冻状态
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1440
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:27,000
你的曾曾祖父发现了
Your great-great-grandfather made one of the greatest discoveries

1441
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:28,500
人类史上最大的发现
in the history of mankind.

1442
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,740
你所看到的就是现代化的来源
Fact is, you're looking at the source of the modern age,

1443
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:38,680
微处理器 激光 航天飞机 汽车... 都是对它进行逆向工程所习得的成果
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars, all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1444
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:42,580
NBE-1 那是我们对它的称呼
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1445
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,780
你不认为美国军方需要知道
And you didn't think the United States military might need to know

1446
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:48,250
你把这么大一台机器人冰冻在地下室吗?
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement?

1447
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:52,350
在最近发生的事件之前 我们并不认为 它的存在对国家安全产生任何危害
Until these events, we had no credible threat to national security.

1448
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:54,330
现在问题可大了
Well, you got one now.

1449
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,660
-但为何要来地球  -因为火种源
-So why Earth? -It's the All Spark.

1450
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:59,290
火种源 那是什么 
All Spark? What is that?

1451
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,960
他们在找一个立方体似的东西
Well, yeah, they came here looking for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1452
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:06,840
NBE-1 也就是他们说的威震天先生
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA Megatron, that's what they call him,

1453
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:09,380
他是死亡的使者 想利用火种魔方
who's pretty much the harbinger of death, wants to use the Cube

1454
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,570
转化科技来统治宇宙
to transform human technology to take over the universe.

1455
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,210
那就是他们的计划
That's their plan.

1456
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,720
-你很确定  -是的
-And you're sure about that? -Yeah.

1457
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:21,320
你们知道那东西在哪里 是不是 
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1458
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,880
跟我来
Follow me.

1459
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:30,020
你们将看到的东西是终极至宝
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1460
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:42,540
碳-14年代测定预估火种魔方 是在公元前一万年来到地球的
Carbon dating puts the Cube here around 10,000 BC.

1461
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:47,070
七元老在1913年才发现它
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1462
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,780
他们知道这是外星物体 因为它表面的烙画
They knew it was alien because of the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1463
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:53,410
和NBE-1表面的烙画非常相似
as well as NBE One.

1464
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,080
胡佛总统因此建造了水坝将它隐藏于其中
President Hoover had the dam built around it.

1465
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:58,560
四个足球场厚度的水泥...
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1466
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:01,990
任何人或外面的任何外星种族
A perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone

1467
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:05,690
都无法侦测出它所散发的能量
or any alien species on the outside.

1468
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:15,690
火种源位置确定

1475
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:48,310
等等 你说水坝隐藏了他的能量
Wait, back up. You said the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1476
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:51,440
-哪种能量  -问得好
-What kind exactly? -Good question.

1477
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:58,890
请进来 他们会把我们反锁在里面
Please step inside. They have to lock us in.

1478
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:06,450
帅
Oh, wow.

1479
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,590
佛瑞迪来过这里吗? (半夜鬼上床里的坏人)
What's that? Freddy Krueger done been up in here or something?

1480
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:09,890
不对
Oh, no, man.

1481
01:40:10,030 --> 01:40:14,490
佛瑞迪有四根爪子 三根爪子的是金刚狼（X战警）
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man. That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1482
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,540
-对不对 是金刚狼  -很好笑
-Right? That's Wolverine! -That's very funny.

1483
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:22,100

I got a phone.

1485
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:29,440
诺基亚真是酷毙了
Nokias are real nasty.

1486
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:33,990
日本人真厉害 他们将武士道发挥地淋漓尽至
You've got to respect the Japanese. They know the way of the samurai.

1487
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:36,920
弱智 诺基亚是芬兰厂家
Nokia's from Finland.

没错 但他 有点奇怪 有点奇怪
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange. He's a little strange.

1489
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:49,930
我们把火种魔方的能源传送到这箱子里
We're able to take the Cube radiation and funnel it into that box.

1490
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:06,920
-好凶的小东西  -好可怕 
-Mean little sucker, huh? -That thing is freaky!

1491
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:10,690
就像装了劲量的兔宝宝一样 (装了电池的玩具兔子一直打鼓走个不停)
Kind of like the itty-bitty Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1492
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:23,570
箱子要给打破了
He's breaking the box.

Banachek. What's going on?

1497
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:59,100
NBE-1 停机棚断电了
Well, the NBE One hangar has lost power...

1498
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:00,270
-什么  -...备用发电机
-What? ...and the backup generator

1499
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,340
-无法产生足够电量  -你有没有军火库
-is just not gonna cut it. -Do you have an arms room?

1500

Get everyone to the NBE One chamber now!

1503
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,350
-灯灭了  -行动 
-The lights are out! -Move it! Move it!

They're popping our generators!

1506

01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:41,240
压力...丧失
We're losing pressure!

1510
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:44,790
冷冻系统失常 NBE-1失控
The cryogenic system is failing! We're losing NBE One!

40毫米穿甲弹在那桌上
Forty millimeter sabot rounds on that table!

1512
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:56,320
带上所有弹药
That's good. Get all the ammo you got. Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1513
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:04,500
你必须带我去我的车 你必须带我去我的车
You got to take me to my car. You have to take me to my car.

1514

它知道怎么处理火种魔方
He's gonna know what to do with the Cube.

1515
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:07,680
-你的车 被没收了  -那就别没收它
-Your car? It's confiscated. -Then unconfiscate it.

1516
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:09,510
我们不知道让它接近能源体会发生什么事 
We do not know what will happen if we let it near this thing!

1517
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:10,870
-是你不知道  -也许你知道 但我不知道
-You don't know. -Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1518
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:12,340
你习惯坐以待毙呢 还是躺以待毙?
You just wanna sit here and wait and see what happens?

1519
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:14,440
很多人的生命掌握在我们手上
I have people's lives at stake here, young man.

1520
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:16,280
带他去见他的车

放下你的武器 战士

1524
01:43:26,430 --> 01:43:28,160
外星人已经发动战争了 而你却要杀我 
There's an alien war going on and you're gonna shoot me?

1525
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:29,290
我们没必要杀你
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1526
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,590
我以第七防区的权力命令你放手
I'm ordering you under S-Seven executive jurisdiction.

1527
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:32,860
第七防区并不存在
S-Seven don't exist.

1528
01:43:32,970 --> 01:43:34,730
我不会听命一个不存在的组织
Right. And we don't take orders from people that don't exist.

1529
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:38,100

01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:42,340
-西门斯  -是 先生
-Simmons? -Yes, sir?

1531
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:46,510
我会照他说的做 他们的字典里没有失败二字
I'd do what he says. Losing's really not an option for these guys.

1532
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,990
好吧 好吧
All right. Okay.

1533
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:57,720
你想把世界的命运交给这小子的车 那好吧
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1534
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,430
住手 住手

No, no, stop, stop, stop! Let him go! Let him go!

1537

你没事吗 
Are you okay?

1538
01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:16,300
他们没伤你吧 
They didn't hurt you, right?

1539
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:28,850
听我说 火种魔方在这里 霸天虎已经来了
Listen to me. The Cube is here and the Decepticons are coming.

1540
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,350
不 不 不 别管他们
No, no, don't worry about them. They're okay. Right?

1541
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:35,690
他们不会伤你的
They're not gonna hurt you.

1542
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,320
退后一点 他没有恶意
Just back up a little bit. He's friendly. He's fine.

1543
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:42,700
放下枪 他们不会伤害你的
Okay, come on. Put the guns down. They're not gonna hurt you.

1544
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,290
跟我来 我带你去看火种源
Here, come with me. I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

Okay, here we go. He doing something. He doing something.

1546
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,320
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

1547
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:37,520
来自太空舰队的消息（这句来自1966年的星际迷航）
Message from Starfleet, Captain.

1548
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:39,030
把这个带走 上尉
Let's get to it.

1549
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:42,150
他说的对 我们留下来就死定了 因为威震天就在隔壁的机棚里
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed with Megatron in the other hangar.

1550
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:43,660
最近的城市在22英哩外
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1551
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:45,060
我们把火种魔方带出去
We're gonna sneak that Cube out of here

1552
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,570
然后藏在城市里

但我们需要空军的帮忙
But we cannot make a stand without the Air Force.

1555

这地方一定有无线电装置吧
This place must have some kind of radio link!

1556

-短波  -有

先生 你一定要想办法传递消息出去 我们走
Sir, you got to figure out some way to get word out to them. Let's move!

1558

是非常旧的仪器
In the alien archive, sir!

1559
01:45:58,950 --> 01:46:00,940

When we get to the city, we're gonna find a radio,

1564
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,790
让埃普斯无线电导引

被人类拿走了
The humans have taken it.

1580

Can you hotwire this computer to transmit a tone through the radio?

1595

那有什么用 
What good is that?

Can you shed any light on the recent, so-called alien activity in the area?

你知道吗 我想如果真有外星人...
Do you know what? I think that if there was some sort of an alien

You know, that's how we know we live in a free land,

1834
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:44,890
因为没有秘密
because there's no secrets.

1835
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,090
他们会说"快 卧倒找掩护"
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1836
02:15:47,090 --> 02:15:48,090
(还有...)
