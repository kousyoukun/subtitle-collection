1
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:47,783
So I get this phone call, July 30th, 2005, from Steven Spielberg.

2
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,125
He calls me up in his jovial self and he says,

3
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,379
"Michael, I want you to direct this movie called Transformers."

4
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,792
I'm like, "Okay, Steven, well, that sounds great.

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,449
"Let me think about it, and I'll get back to you."

6
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,677
I hung up the phone

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,529
and in the 30 seconds everything that goes through your brain.

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,042
"Is that that little robot toy movie?" "Is that like a Small Soldiers movie?"

9
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,355
"That was just Steven Spielberg calling me up. Oh, my God!"

10
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,801
"This is one of my idols, wants me to direct a movie

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,628
"that he wants to be involved in."

12
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,853
So I thought about it.

13
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,110
I called Adam Goodman, president of the studio at DreamWorks.

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,082
I said, "Adam, so what is this Transformers movie?"

15
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,000
He goes, "Why don't you think about it?"

16
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,123
Adam convinced me to go to Transformer school,

17
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,330
which is in Hasbro in Rhode Island.

18
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,416
And I'm like, "Okay, well, let's make the trek."

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,024
So the next morning we went into Hasbro.

20
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:37,097
You pass this hallway of all the famous toys we all grew up with.

21
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,144
We sat in this big conference room.

22
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,457
I mean, they must have had 25 people in there,

23
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,999
all trying to convince me to do Transformers,

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,868
and they started with Transformer school

25
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,935
which is, they basically take you through the entire lore of Transformers.

26
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,904
Now, I have been offered a lot of comic book, superhero movies

27
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,581
in my short film career.

28
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,899
And I have always said no because it really hasn't appealed to me.

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,909
But one thing I did spark to recently was Japanese anime movies.

30
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,598
I just love their visuals. It's just a really unique type of cartoon.

31
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,193
And I'm sitting in this Transformer, I guess, like, lecture.

32
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,099
I kept looking at this artwork of just a multitude of images

33
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,983
and there was something from this Japanese artist.

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,254
He had some amazingly dark, cool images that...

35
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,711
That just right there in the room inspired me.

36
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,808
I kept thinking to myself, "I need to make this very real.

37
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,253
"I need to make this cool."

38
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,359
I kept thinking about cars transforming at 80 miles an hour.

39
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,723
Action images would just kind of come to my mind,

40
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,586
of, like, "Why would I be interested in doing this movie?"

41
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,504
I did like the lore of Transformers.

42
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,131
It's very noble, it's got good morals, it's interesting.

43
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,369
But it's like, how do you make Transformers

44
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,862
understandable to an adult

45
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,471
who has no knowledge of what Transformer toys are?

46
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,789
We broadened the story in terms of bringing in the American military.

47
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,525
It's this big story, but it kind of comes down to this little story on Earth,

48
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,842
which is all about Sam and having these glasses.

49
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:08,132
This is kind of how the birth of Transformers happened.

50
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,603
I have always had the lucky fortune of working with military equipment

51
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,016
before anybody else, such as these Ospreys right here.

52
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,594
They have never been used in a movie,

53
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:27,576
and I don't think many people have shot that Stealth 117 either.

54
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,754
So I've got this hotline to the Pentagon.

55
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:34,992
I've got this relationship with the film liaison, Phil Strub,

56
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:40,247
who helped me on Armageddon where we worked with the Air Force.

57
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,943
And Pearl Harbor, where we worked with the Navy and all the branches.

58
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:48,494
And I called Phil up and I said, "Phil, I'm gonna be doing this movie.

59
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,523
"It's a fantasy movie called Transformers."

60
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,642
And he goes, "Oh, the kids' toy, huh?"

61
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,810
He said, "Well, Mike, you know, if we did have alien robots on Earth,

62
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,062
"I think the American military would be involved.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,196
"And we will bring the fight anywhere we have to.

64
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,086
"So let me read the script. I'm excited to read it."

65
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:11,555
And I guess the rest is history. He loved it.

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,307
And then it's a matter of me going to different bases

67
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:19,862
and trying to convince bases to be...Imitate Qatar,

68
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:24,169
which is the forward command for the whole Middle East.

69
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,265
And we found Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico,

70
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,474
which kind of has these white sands

71
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,763
which are test missile ranges for, I think, the Army.

72
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,420
Right here, this was done at Edwards. These are two F-22s,

73
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,648
which are the brand-new planes that are costing $1 30 million each.

74
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,788
They can take out six F-1 6s before they can even be spotted.

75
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,791
They are just deadly lethal,

76
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,471
and of course, I was the first to use those as well.

77
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,009
Why does the military let me use this stuff?

78
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,369
Because they look good at what they do in my movies.

79
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:05,746
And working with these men and women...

80
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,298
You know, I have done many years of working with them, in movies,

81
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,146
and, you know, they are really great people.

82
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,670
And they're really dedicated.

83
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:21,003
And I really admire them for the service they do for the country.

84
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,560
And, you know, they don't work for a great wage,

85
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,662
but they're just so dedicated to the country and...

86
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,156
You know, so, like, just diligent and just, you know...

87
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,614
I find many of them so intelligent,

88
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:43,355
and it's always been a great experience when I've worked on these bases.

89
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,749
And I really have fond memories of it.

90
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,849
And very much, they're impressed with our film industry

91
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,447
because we work very much like the military works,

92
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,637
in terms of the different hierarchy and how it works on our sets and crews.

93
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,366
And they are always very skeptical when we show up,

94
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,364
because they think we're going to be a bunch of Hollywood...

95
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,678
But they always come away with, I'm sure, with a great respect.

96
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,978
And they tell us that,

97
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,073
that they come away with a great respect for what we do,

98
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,401
because they see it so similar to the military.

99
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,839
So this was our first transformation here.

100
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,329
And the transformation was... "How are we gonna do this, basically?"

101
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,430
I had my animators do rough versions of it.

102
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,236
But when we had this first version up...

103
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,997
That was the very first version I ever saw of that transformation.

104
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,151
And it was done by an artist named Keiji.

105
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,431
He's Japanese. He speaks like no English.

106
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,852
He is the absolute Rubik's Cube genius to figure those things out,

107
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,905
of how those parts actually move and come together.

108
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,418
I met Keiji in a very odd meeting at industrial Light and Magic.

109
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:04,743
I had about 30 lLM artists sitting in a kind of hi-def room

110
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,964
where we are looking at the artwork

111
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,810
that my illustrators had worked for months,

112
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,172
I mean we're talking eight months, on.

113
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,059
And then I saw Optimus Prime's face in his first 3-D kind of,

114
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,349
I guess, iteration of him.

115
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,444
He looked terrible. He had this fat, ugly face.

116
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,969
And I'm like, "You guys got to be kidding me.

117
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,305
"This is awful. What happened to Optimus?"

118
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:35,487
And all of a sudden, in this small room, this guy pops up in the back,

119
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,142
and he goes, "That Optimus Prime is an insult to the Japanese people.

120
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,137
"That is an insult to the Japanese, I want to do Optimus Prime."

121
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,568
But you can tell someone else was obviously modeling

122
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,432
Optimus Prime's fat, ugly face and Keiji knew this.

123
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,189
And so I said, "Keiji, first of all, this is the most bizarre meeting

124
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,184
"I have ever been to, the biggest, funniest outbreak I have ever seen,

125
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,508
"and you know what, just because of that,

126
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,794
"I'm gonna let you work on Optimus Prime."

127
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,858
So not only did Keiji do Optimus Prime in terms of the 3-D modeling,

128
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,823
but he did the amazing Rubik's Cube

129
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,700
of how we were going to transform these robots.

130
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,444
What the military is very concerned of when they do movies

131
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,540
is that they just want things to be accurate.

132
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,066
They are very into, like, those uniforms.

133
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,247
If they are not Qatar-issue uniforms, we just can't use them.

134
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,582
Right here, I shot this in the Tank Graveyard.

135
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,797
These are old tanks, some are just kind of shells of other tanks,

136
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,574
where they actually put them out in the field,

137
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,280
in this white sand, and they use them as target-practice.

138
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,911
We actually started the shoot, the very first day was...

139
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,790
I shot this little, I guess, Mars rover. I shot that.

140
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,154
I got it assembled because I had this idea for a teaser

141
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,466
that was the very first teaser that came out the summer

142
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,099
where we just began to start... We just started shooting.

143
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:07,772
I just wanted to mark our date of July 4th and to say we were real.

144
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,240
The very first day of pre-production photography,

145
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,698
I shot in the Tank Graveyard.

146
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,084
My first days really never suck, but this one really sucked.

147
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,502
I get to the set, I'm all excited,

148
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,993
and I'm walking around with my viewfinder, ready to go.

149
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,061
And I get on set an hour before call

150
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,822
and the hour passes and then I'm waiting, "Okay, where's my crew?"

151
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,787
I'm like, "This isn't good."

152
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,379
My crew apparently was just eating dinner.

153
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,691
And normally when you get to set, you show up,

154
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,704
you either eat dinner before...

155
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:44,467
So my cameraman, Mitchell Amundsen, my operators, everyone's eating.

156
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,630
And I'm like, "Okay." And that pissed me off, the first night.

157
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,314
So I'm like, "Mitch, this is a big movie,

158
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,578
"and you're not going to be eating your burritos any more

159
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,751
"when I show up to set and I'm ready to work."

160
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:01,606
So I think that kind of shook the ground of everyone, the first night.

161
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,005
Because I got to tell you, when I come on the set

162
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,906
I'm like, I come in... They joke on the set,

163
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,426
"Bay's coming in hot."

164
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,876
It means I like to work. I don't like to fart around,

165
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,628
and everyone knows that I do a lot of set-ups every day.

166
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:21,857
An average on a movie is 1 9 to 25. I do 50, 60, sometimes 75.

167
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,040
And these are real set-ups.

168
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:30,077
And I shot a lot of this movie very, kind of, suburbia.

169
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,938
But I didn't kind of sex it up in terms of making this slick.

170
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,369
This is a classroom that we all know about, we have all been to.

171
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:44,068
And it's something that makes it more accessible, I think, to everybody.

172
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:48,865
And like, I have never in my life ever shot in a Burger King.

173
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,266
But you know what? We all eat at Burger King or McDonald's or whatever,

174
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,794
and it just makes it more everyday life.

175
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,456
And I kind of like this, kind of, sci-fi movie

176
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,251
coupled with this suburbia life.

177
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,250
I thought it was a good mix.

178
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,491
And casting Shia...

179
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,463
I actually started to look for kids and I had...

180
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:15,187
My casting ladies scoured the Earth for the best 16, 17, 18, 19, 20-year-old kid

181
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,064
that can play a 16-year-old out there.

182
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,900
And we looked from London to Australia to Canada,

183
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,648
and Ian Bryce was the first to mention to me Shia LaBeouf.

184
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,813
Or "LaBoof." I call him "Shia LeBuff."

185
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,377
I said, "Well, I saw him in Constantine,

186
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,158
"and I have never seen the movie Holes,

187
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,390
"but in Constantine he was playing a cab driver. He looked a little old."

188
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:42,370
So the kid came in, and he was kind of skinny

189
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,741
and, like, a little goofy and way over-excited.

190
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,670
I'm like, "Dude, you got to calm down here,

191
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,303
"you're just auditioning with me at my office."

192
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,220
And he goes, "Wow, I just...l want to be an action guy and I want to be a...

193
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,299
"It's just like, wow, I love your movies and I can't believe I'm meeting you."

194
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:04,062
I'm like, "All right, calm down, let's just do the audition."

195
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:11,221
And I just instantly liked his energy in the audition.

196
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:15,918
You know, we had some of our early, early written pages,

197
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,311
where the dialogue really needed to be tweaked and made more real.

198
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,489
And sometimes it's actually good to read with some clunky dialogue,

199
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,737
and you see how actors could fare through,

200
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,062
because a good actor can make any line sound good.

201
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,282
And Spielberg will even tell you that.

202
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,263
That's the art of acting, in a way.

203
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,340
But I started throwing some stuff to Shia,

204
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,499
like improv-ing with him a bit in the audition.

205
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,597
My thing is I love finding actors that can improv

206
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,957
because a lot of my film-making, we improv as we go.

207
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,296
I mean, we have the basis of the scene.

208
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,915
I mean, I kind of learned this on working with Martin and Will on Bad Boys.

209
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,261
Shia just had this great thing.

210
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,120
And, you know, I called Steven, and I said, "I met with Shia."

211
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:07,037
And Steven goes, "I love Shia." So he was all excited about that.

212
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,402
And I said, "Well, I really want to show you this tape."

213
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,625
I went downstairs and because I had auditioned a couple of other kids

214
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:22,273
and he just was heads and tails above every other kid that came in.

215
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,591
And I asked the girls in the office,

216
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,754
my assistants who are very blunt, I said,

217
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,000
"So what do you think of him?"

218
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,338
I said, "Just watch the DVD, watch his video."

219
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,950
They saw and they go like, "Oh, my God, he's great, he's great.

220
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,980
"He's so funny, he's so charming, he's so funny."

221
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,422
So I sent the audition to Steven,

222
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,442
and then I called Shia back.

223
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:46,562
And meanwhile I had to make this movie for a price.

224
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,507
And I actually do some of my own actor deals

225
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,253
because when I make a movie for a price, I make it for a price.

226
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,493
So I have to play a tough guy and I say, "Basically, if you want the part,

227
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,383
"you got 24 hours to decide. This is what we are going to pay you.

228
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,863
"Yes or no, give me an answer in 24 hours."

229
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:08,045
So sometimes that's the only way to get a deal done.

230
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:12,379
I must say, I'm very proud of the fact

231
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,714
that we made this movie for $150,000,000.

232
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,966
But I'll go into that later, okay?

233
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:24,099
But Shia, I guess he was my first snag on the cast.

234
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,482
And from there it followed to Jon Voight

235
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:33,942
and then the amazing John Turturro, who I had always wanted to work with.

236
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,798
I originally thought of Steve Buscemi, but Steve was busy directing something,

237
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,798
because I love working with Steve and Turturro is someone I've always loved.

238
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,278
Me being such a huge Coen Brothers fan.

239
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,745
It's like, anyone who can bowl and have a rose in their bowling ball,

240
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,369
I got to work with that guy.

241
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,107
From there we kind of went on to get our female,

242
00:14:55,353 --> 00:15:01,462
and I looked at a lot of females. It was a very hard role to cast

243
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,652
and Megan Fox is someone we auditioned for a movie

244
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,739
I produced for Platinum Dunes for Amityville Horror.

245
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:16,546
And I remembered her and my casting ladies brought her in.

246
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,635
I said I wanted to see her because I really liked her look.

247
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,466
And in person she's very, kind of, timid and shy. She's from Tennessee.

248
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,989
She had a sweetness about her, and I knew I had to make her tough.

249
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,537
And she was very new at acting.

250
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,889
But I just liked something about her.

251
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,450
There was something that was more exciting to work

252
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:43,879
with an actress who is fresh and not done a lot of movies.

253
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:49,063
And so I had Shia come in and work with her.

254
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:54,565
And we did several auditions with her

255
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:59,387
and working with Megan, she was so timid in the beginning,

256
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:04,184
just being on this big, massive set.

257
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,979
But there was a good kind of chemistry between her and Shia.

258
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,617
Shia was able to really lighten her up,

259
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,070
and there were times I really had to make her tough.

260
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,858
And every actor has a button you got to push once in a while,

261
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,013
and you got to figure out what that button is when you're directing them.

262
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,222
And her button was...Because l couldn't get her to emote tough enough

263
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:28,603
when she was, like, cutting that little robot in half with a saw.

264
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,864
And it just was looking way too girly, way un-tough.

265
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:36,155
And I'm like, "Megan, remember I told you when you got this part,

266
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,884
"you had to be tough."

267
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,429
And she told me she would hang out with mechanics or whatever

268
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,580
to get this movie part.

269
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,345
Finally, her button was, I said, "Megan, we have so much money on this movie,

270
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,981
"we will stay here all night long to get this one shot.

271
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,293
"I don't care if we stay here 15 hours, we're gonna shoot it all night long.

272
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,118
"Because you will hate this shot right now.

273
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,107
"Come here, look at the monitor."

274
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,149
And all of a sudden that would get her angry. It would get her pissed.

275
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,508
And that was her button where she was able to really give me...

276
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,733
Like emote, and whatnot.

277
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,017
So anyway, I just thought she had a good thing with her and Shia.

278
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,202
And Shia was able to really throw a lot of things at her.

279
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,292
And, you know, her problem was with his improv,

280
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,970
she just kept laughing through the takes. So that wasn't good.

281
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,806
Many of the times we had to CG her face out when she was laughing.

282
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,475
No, I'm kidding, we didn't.

283
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,678
Mojo, the dog, was kind of like an idea...

284
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,085
I just love dogs and like...

285
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,906
You know what, a dog addicted to pain pills with a cast,

286
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,616
that's just funny.

287
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:47,970
So I said to the writers, I said, "Let's put a dog named Mojo."

288
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,445
So I auditioned a bunch of Chihuahuas.

289
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,976
And this one was, I guess, by far the best one.

290
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,283
Then I thought, what better than having a Chihuahua

291
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,939
that's stoned eating pain pills,

292
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,713
that hobbles up on his little penthouse of a birdhouse.

293
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,238
So you can imagine when I'm telling the art department,

294
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,139
"I want to build this little silly, little doghouse,

295
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,982
"but it's elevated."

296
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,809
Well, this gives the movie audience a laugh,

297
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,644
because that's just funny.

298
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:26,273
Right here, the dad right here, this is my best friend,

299
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,715
Robert Offer, who's my lawyer, who I have known since nursery school.

300
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,535
He has a problem with his kids.

301
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,526
He doesn't let his kids walk on his grass.

302
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:38,054
And I have always...l save things up that I learn in life for movies.

303
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,760
And I'm like, "What neurotic dad

304
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,945
"doesn't let their kids walk on his own grass?"

305
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,762
Well, this is Robert Offer right now.

306
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:51,192
And this right here is complete improve, where...

307
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,225
This is an example of how

308
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:58,339
we were playing around with Kevin Dunn and Julie White,

309
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:02,350
this amazing mom who just actually won a Tony. A Tony award.

310
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,973
<i>At this time, we can't confirm whether there were any survivors.</i>

311
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,484
Oh, my God.

312
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now, at DEFCON Delta,</i>

313
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,647
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

314
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,685
We're dealing with a very effective weapons system

315
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
that we have not come across before.

316
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
<i>But our prayers are with the families of the brave men and women...</i>

317
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,226
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

318
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,059
I've never seen a weapons system like this.

319
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,032
The thermal shows this weird aura around the exoskeleton

320
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
like it's cloaked by some kind of invisible force field.

321
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
That's impossible. There's no such thing as invisible force fields

322
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,906
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

323
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,311
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

324
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,574
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

325
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,653
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

326
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,717
and that thing that attacked us? I got a feeling it ain't over.

327
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
How about you use those magic voodoo powers

328
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,019
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

329
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,496
When I took that picture, I think it saw me.

330
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,464
It looked right at me.

331
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
All right, we got to get this thing back to the Pentagon right away.

332
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,007
They got to know what we're dealing with here.

333
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

334
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,538
<i>- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

335
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,615
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

336
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

337
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,012
All right, let's hit it.

338
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,788
Dude, are you sure we're invited to this party?

339
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,760
Of course, Miles. It's a lake. Public property.

340
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:38,663
This is a scene where for Shia, you know, our character Sam...

341
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,669
This is an experience where every guy has had this experience,

342
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,504
where the tough guy comes up

343
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:47,297
and kind of tries to embarrass you in front of his friends.

344
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:52,571
This moment right here is the moment where

345
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,827
I think every guy first of all identifies with him.

346
00:20:55,005 --> 00:21:01,524
But you like him instantly because he's able to come back with comedy and wit.

347
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,989
This guy, John, right here, he jumps up on this tree

348
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,896
and I'm like, "Wait a minute, that's great, that's funny.

349
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,015
"I mean, what kind of kooky-ass friend would hang on a tree

350
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,699
"and make this kid embarrassed?"

351
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,686
So I wasn't gonna make this kid the geek,

352
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,210
because I didn't want the geek.

353
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,430
I wanted the geek who was sharp, who was witty

354
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,253
but was able to come back with humor.

355
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:23,556
And right here with this whole "coloring book" thing,

356
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,980
this is, I think, where you kind of fall in love with this kid.

357
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,320
No, it's a good book. Your friends'll love it.

358
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,333
You know, it's got mazes in it and, you know, little coloring areas, sections, pop-up pictures.

359
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:36,781
It's a lot of fun.

360
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,115
That's funny.

361
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,512
People were very worried about the tone of this movie,

362
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,586
where it was very edgy and hard

363
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:47,277
and then it had these funny kind of suburbia touches.

364
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:52,153
And, you know, that's the thing that everyone talks about,

365
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,155
the tone of the movie. They love the tone of the movie,

366
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,874
and that's what, around the world, when I did press for this movie,

367
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,059
everyone talks about the tone and how funny it is.

368
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,953
And, you know, that's just kind of what I like doing.

369
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:07,430
It's my thing.

370
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,370
God, I can't even tell you how much I'm not your little bunny.

371
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,367
Okay. You'll call me.

372
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,509
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

373
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,101
Hey, man, what's wrong with your radio?

374
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,113
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

375
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,843
She's an evil jock concubine, man. Let her hitchhike.

376
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
She lives 10 miles from here, okay? It's my only chance.

377
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,948
You got to be understanding here, all right?

378
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,453
All right. We'll put her in the back. I'll be quiet.

379
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,183
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

380
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,088
I'm not putting her in the back. You got to get out of my car.

381
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,524
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

382
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
Bros before hos.

383
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,692
Miles, I'm begging you to get out of my car. Okay?

384
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,786
You can't do this to me.

385
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,991
You got to get out of my car right now.

386
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:53,067
So when I signed on to do this movie,

387
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,607
God, there was a lot of talk on the Internet about,

388
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:00,756
"Michael Bay will wreck this movie, he won't know how to do this movie.

389
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:05,006
"He doesn't know anything about Transformers."

390
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:13,090
You know, stuff like, "Michael Bay is wrecking my childhood."

391
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,703
"Death to Michael Bay." Boy, I had a lot of death threats, I must say.

392
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,247
They even actually protested at one of my offices,

393
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,001
but it was an office I had moved out of two years prior,

394
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:26,584
so, you know, I guess they weren't that smart, to figure out where to protest.

395
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:31,104
But I remember listening to stuff on the lnternet.

396
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,958
I would listen to some of their ideas that they would talk about,

397
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,524
because fan support is very important,

398
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,545
and I wanted them to be happy with Transformers.

399
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,070
But I was trying to introduce a world of people

400
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,898
that have never seen Transformers to this movie.

401
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:55,933
And, I think, in a way, it was better that I wasn't a Transformer fan,

402
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:59,542
because I was able to make this movie more accessible

403
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,731
to the non-fan, I guess.

404
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:07,618
So I must say right now, I am a true Transformer fan.

405
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,340
I have probably thought about robots

406
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,728
more than anybody in the past year and a half.

407
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,867
And probably... I thought about robots

408
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,598
more than anybody else on Earth for the past year and a half.

409
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,920
We would have artwork that would leak.

410
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,124
I mean, it was truly one of the most sought-after movies

411
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:29,500
and talked about on the Internet than I can remember in a very long time.

412
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:34,391
Our art server had 39,000 attempted hacks

413
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:38,995
in the month of January, in the year 2006.

414
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:45,709
And we had to literally get, like, almost Pentagon-type quality encryption.

415
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:51,852
And they actually personally hacked into my personal computer.

416
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:56,030
And they were able to steal one script.

417
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,599
We know who stole it, and I was able to get the script back.

418
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,184
But luckily it only got out once.

419
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:08,293
So there were so many leaks that l decided to actually keep the script...

420
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:14,579
Just literally, I had the only original script in my computer.

421
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:21,640
And certain actors had ones that were older

422
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,530
and everyone had coded scripts.

423
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,124
And we collected all the scripts from the crew.

424
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,672
We gave them out and they gave it back

425
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,500
and all those different measures.

426
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,054
And there was one script, a very old script

427
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,711
that got out on the Internet that everyone read,

428
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,903
and everyone kept commenting on, and...

429
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,550
But it was so old, scripts can change.

430
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,181
In a month you can change so much in a script.

431
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,093
And theirs was, like, probably five months

432
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,366
older than what the script was in the movie.

433
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:50,953
I mean, we had... In case the script got out,

434
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:54,612
we had names of our robots, a. k. a. names.

435
00:25:54,846 --> 00:26:01,160
But there were many characters that I tried to create.

436
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,033
Like, let me give you an example. We were working on this movie,

437
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,063
budgeting this movie and they have to make these toys,

438
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:10,711
like molds and like the idea of these type of molds,

439
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,254
a year and a half out. We didn't even have a script

440
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,881
and Ian Bryce came to me and says,

441
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:19,982
"Hasbro needs to know what Transformer vehicles

442
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,848
"and what are you using for the Decepticons?

443
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,350
"Autobots and Decepticons. What kind of cars?"

444
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,659
And I'm, like, literally had to come to a choice with, like,

445
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,714
"Okay, I think, maybe a tank.

446
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:35,831
"I don't know if we can get that amazing bomb-searching Buffalo truck,

447
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,012
"that's brand new, that they are sending to Iraq,

448
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,098
"if we can maybe do that one.

449
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,781
"I definitely, if I can get an F-22, but I don't know if we can get an F-22."

450
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,180
So that's how we kind of had to decide. We had to decide very quickly.

451
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,971
There it is.

452
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,450
I had fun. So, you know, thanks for listening.

453
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,184
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

454
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,485
I think you're... No, no, no.

455
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,195
I think there's a lot more than meets the eye with you.

456
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,135
Okay.

457
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,104
Yeah.

458
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,730
All right, I'll see you at school.

459
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,899
All right.

460
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,281
That's stupid.

461
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,640
That was a stupid line.

462
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,549
"There's more than meets the eye with you." Stupid.

463
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,321
Oh, God.

464
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,317
Oh, my God. I love my car.

465
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:58,867
Hey, guys, I think the other team figured it out. Iran.

466
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,640
Come on, man. This is way too smart for Iranian scientists.

467
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,513
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

468
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,213
No way. This is nothing like what the Chinese are using.

469
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,722
This is Air Force One. Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

470
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,885
<i>We will hunt down this enemy. And when we do,</i>

471
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,190
<i>we'll know just what to do with them.</i>

472
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,893
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

473
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:29,733
I also wanted to make other characters, like in the boom box on Air Force One.

474
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,916
I like this kind of character,

475
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,679
and I think, if we do Transformers 2,

476
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,348
we're gonna have a lot more unique characters,

477
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,229
like this but also bigger.

478
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,457
And just, you can imagine where the mind can go here.

479
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,877
I mean, I designed some...

480
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,012
With the artists, some amazingly huge characters

481
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,937
who just got to be too big, too costly, too expensive, whatever.

482
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,704
And it was Steven who said,

483
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,415
"You know what? We should probably just keep this kind of like

484
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:00,570
"six against five or something, where it's a little bit more manageable."

485
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,091
And I think he's right that we keep it smaller

486
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,752
to kind of try to introduce what's going on here.

487
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,854
Steven says I saved 30 grand right there by doing that little one camera move.

488
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:27,294
We had a guy grab the boom box. He's right. So I saved an effect.

489
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:35,557
Then right in here, this is our actually full-scale puppet of this...Frenzy here.

490
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:56,248
Frenzy was animated by a French artist

491
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,821
at lLM.

492
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,962
I liked this very quirky kind of movement.

493
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:07,007
And when I was directing the animation,

494
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:08,778
because I would actually every single day,

495
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,161
I would work with animators

496
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,380
where they would send me down what they are working on

497
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:15,474
so that I can actually direct them,

498
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:19,008
you know, after these shots that... We have done these plate shots

499
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,953
and try to direct their acting.

500
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:24,229
I got to tell these characters so well

501
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,450
that I knew that when another artist was working on this Frenzy character,

502
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,029
he wasn't the French guy.

503
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,040
I'm like, "Well, did you guys have a different animator working on this?"

504
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:39,130
They are like...You hear them kind of over the conference call, "Yeah."

505
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,019
So I'm like, "You got to put the French guy back on,

506
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,210
"because it's a total different character."

507
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:48,606
You know, and he says, "He's on another movie, he's working on Pirates."

508
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,520
I said, "Well, you got to get the French guy back.

509
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,322
"Whatever you got to do, you got to get the French guy back."

510
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,748
Someone! They're hacking into Air Force One!

511
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,377
We need a senior analyst.

512
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,352
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

513
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,981
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

514
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,289
and stealing a whole lot of data from your system at the same time.

515
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,919
Code Red. We have a breach.

516
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,760
Air Force One, someone onboard has breached the military network.

517
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,631
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

518
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,640
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

519
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,870
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

520
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,675
Permission to take down the Defense Network.

521
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,774
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

522
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:36,211
My theory on effects, well, it all comes down to lighting.

523
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:40,272
And I feel everyone in their brain

524
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,483
has something that we don't really know that's there,

525
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,050
but we can tell when something is not lit right.

526
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,558
We don't know why it's there,

527
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,735
but we just know there's something wrong with the shot,

528
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,945
and it's all coming down to lighting.

529
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,792
Because we are used to looking at the world

530
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,991
the way we see it through our eyes.

531
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,920
After I did Pearl Harbor, Dennis Muren said to me...

532
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,206
He says, "You raised the bar on effects."

533
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,769
And I'm like, "What did he mean by that?"

534
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,845
And he goes, "You have just made effects more realistic."

535
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:12,485
And the first time I went to lLM, or used them, was on Pearl Harbor.

536
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:16,319
And I had a big meeting up there where I just felt

537
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,951
that Lucas' stuff is awesome, but it's very pastel.

538
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,101
In terms of their light, it doesn't look real,

539
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,664
the shadows aren't dark enough,

540
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,852
it doesn't have enough contrast.

541
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,102
It doesn't have the right ripple reflections on metal.

542
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,804
So that was one of the big achievements

543
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,464
I think we worked with on Pearl Harbor,

544
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,531
in terms of shooting a movie at 1 2:00 noon,

545
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:40,654
and making it, not disguising it in night and showing it in broad daylight.

546
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,873
And making the planes as real as possible and all these other ships.

547
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:48,203
And so I think that's what Dennis was talking about.

548
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:51,463
Well, you know this, we had to take it to a brand new level,

549
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,592
in terms of trying to make reality here.

550
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,118
So we spent a tremendous amount of time

551
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:01,629
and software and just trying to invent new tricks

552
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:04,935
on how to light these robots.

553
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,504
They use this process called ray tracing.

554
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:11,450
When you look at a car, you go out on a parking lot...

555
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,649
I've shot a lot of car commercials, so...

556
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:17,706
I was trying to explain, you can't just have one quality of light

557
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,912
on a car, on a piece of sheet metal.

558
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,961
It will reflect soft light, hard light

559
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,364
it will have pings, it will have long lines.

560
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,125
Cars are, like, a nightmare to light,

561
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,054
in terms of if you're actually doing a total digital model of a car.

562
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:38,466
So you probably couldn't have done this movie,

563
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:40,838
I guess, as of two years ago.

564
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,871
So in terms of our effects,

565
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:58,034
we had Industrial Light and Magic that were heading up Transformers,

566
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,396
and we had Digital Domain, which is an effects company

567
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:04,575
that I recently purchased with a couple of other partners.

568
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:07,111
Those are the ones that did...

569
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,209
Both companies did the work for this movie.

570
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:16,489
lLM did three-quarters and Digital Domain did the last quarter.

571
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,517
lLM came down and they talked to me

572
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:22,676
about something that was used in Star Wars III.

573
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:25,126
It was a digital model of a character

574
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:28,705
that was kind of like a robot, and it was so uncomplicated.

575
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:32,094
I'm like, "Guys, we have to go so much farther than this."

576
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:36,713
General Grievous was ILM's most complicated digital model at the time

577
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,109
and it was, if you look at it, it's so simple

578
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:42,802
compared to the complexity that we needed to do our models.

579
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,954
They talked about these models which finally, when they were done,

580
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,727
Optimus Prime is made of 1 0,1 08 parts

581
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:54,002
that all have to move, not intersect,

582
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:59,247
and it's just an immensely

583
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:02,867
complicated digital model.

584
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:07,016
They say they're the most complicated digital models ever made.

585
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,103
My name is Sam Witwicky.

586
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:08,941
Whoever finds this

587
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,141
my car is alive, okay?

588
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:15,517
So this is actually Shia's first night, and you can see his nappy hair right now.

589
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:16,931
I just kept looking at his hair, I said,

590
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:18,508
"Dude, we gotta do something with your hair."

591
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,606
And he says, "Mike, what's the matter with my hair?"

592
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,939
I said, "It just looks nappy. We gotta make it cooler."

593
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:28,522
I wasn't allowed to cut it because he was still shooting Disturbia.

594
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:31,631
And this is his first scene for the movie,

595
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,310
and those dogs chasing him are actually killer police dogs.

596
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,668
And Shia's running,

597
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:41,043
and there's a man in a big dog suit who stands behind him,

598
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,416
and he was there with a whip, and he was calling the dogs.

599
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:46,559
Well, they actually missed the guy with the big dog suit

600
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:47,965
where they're supposed to chomp on the arm,

601
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,143
and they kept going after Shia.

602
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,270
Shia was almost killed that night, I am not kidding you.

603
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,754
Thank God he was fast.

604
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:59,906
It wasn't good when the guy with the whip, he says, "Uh-oh, uh-oh."

605
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:03,086
The whole crew started chasing after the dogs

606
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:07,285
with the big chains on their necks, so we were able to tackle them.

607
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,796
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

608
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,458
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

609
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,628
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

610
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,302
Put your head on the hood.

611
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,732
If you have military assistance, you have to have advisors on the set

612
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:36,582
that are from the Pentagon that make sure

613
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,930
that we're doing things correctly.

614
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:43,552
They won't tell us, like, what lines we have to say and what we can't say,

615
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,625
but it's just gotta be accurate.

616
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,178
When Rachael here had to go into this room,

617
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,854
I was just gonna have her slip into the room,

618
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:52,231
but we had to have this other guy knock on the window.

619
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,333
That was the only way they were gonna let me do this shot,

620
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:59,151
because they would say there would be no way in the Pentagon for her

621
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,539
to slip into a private room like this.

622
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:05,475
So you gotta make these little concessions here and there.

623
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:10,328
And I said to the guy, "Are you sure that would never happen?"

624
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,992
"No way, that would be impossible. " "Are you sure?"

625
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:16,517
"No, that's impossible."

626
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,929
So, okay, I'm, like, "All right, this is the way we gotta block this scene."

627
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,970
shows North Korea doubling its naval activity.

628
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,566
Maybe it's a precaution, because isn't that what we're doing?

629
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,044
The signal pattern is learning. It's evolving on its own.

630
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,411
And you need to move past Fourier transfers

631
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,711
and start considering quantum mechanics.

632
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,151
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

633
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,746
What about an organism? A living organism?

634
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,257
Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer?

635
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,023
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

636
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,057
We have six floors of analysts working on this thing.

637
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,498
Now, if you can find proof to back up your theory,

638
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,093
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you. But if you don't get a filter

639
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,141
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna be off the team. You understand?

640
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,050
Look, I can't be any clearer than how crystal clear I am being.

641
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,318
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

642
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,551
Wow. That's really neat.

643
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,786
Okay, chiefie.

644
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,957
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

645
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,862
What are you rolling?

646
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
Whippets? Goofballs? A little wowie sauce with the boys?

647
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,767
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

648
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,368
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

649
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,235
Is that what the kids are doing now? Little bit of Mojo?

650
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,973
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

651
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,213
What was that?

652
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,051
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

653
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,683
You wanna go? Make something happen. Do it.

654
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,993
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

655
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,629
Are you on drugs?

656
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:03,810
This was actually the very first day of official shooting right here.

657
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,005
New Mexico, White Sands.

658
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,440
Let's hope this telephone line works.

659
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,449
Hey, heads up!

660
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,180
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

661
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
What the heck was that?

662
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,098
English, dude. English.

663
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:35,383
The way we made the Skorponoks work

664
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,739
was I remembered something we did in Armageddon

665
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:43,831
where we did these primer cord explosions that...

666
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:49,867
Primer cord's like a very stable kind of explosive device.

667
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,017
It's like rope.

668
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:55,141
And we put like 150 of these in a row,

669
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:58,072
and they had a computer that was able

670
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:01,629
to fire milliseconds apart from each other so it made a ripple effect.

671
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,852
And that's how we did this shot right here with this ripple shooting up

672
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:08,268
and the thing jumping out right behind them.

673
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,322
I remember doing the animatic for that shot.

674
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,529
I said, "You know what? That shot's a trailer shot."

675
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:16,822
And that was Tyrese's second day

676
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,871
where the guys actually had to run over a carpet of explosives

677
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,608
as the stuff was fired behind them.

678
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:25,953
I'm, like, "Guys, do not stop, do not trip,

679
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,371
"and we're gonna fire these things off,

680
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:31,431
"and this stand's gonna go, because it will really hurt your foot."

681
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:36,793
So that look is, I guess, one of fear and real terror, there.

682
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:43,087
A lot of these guys, these rangers here, are the real deal.

683
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:48,472
Many of them were very decorated United States SEALs and Rangers.

684
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,905
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

685
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,277
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

686
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,350
Fire!

687
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,779
This scene right here with Josh

688
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,106
was something that I remember a real SEAL telling me.

689
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:02,329
It happened down in Grenada where they were trapped in a house.

690
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:03,694
They lost all their coms,

691
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,751
and they had a cell phone where they had to call to the Pentagon

692
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,648
and literally had to get a credit card to get out of the country

693
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:14,918
and link up with an operator at the Pentagon to get an air strike to come in.

694
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:17,139
And they had to vector in their position.

695
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,703
So something I always held in my ideas of wanting to get into a movie,

696
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:24,901
and so this was an idea of making it

697
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,787
kind of fun and serious at the same time.

698
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:29,341
I just like the whole chain of events

699
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:32,322
and how fast you can see this air strike come in.

700
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:37,005
It's called an Air Force Combat Controller. That's what Tyrese plays.

701
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:43,079
An Air Force Combat Controller is a job that a guy can use a gun.

702
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,696
He can help them in battle, but he's a very important tool

703
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:49,483
in terms of getting very deadly air support,

704
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,428
which is what they call "danger close,"

705
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:54,347
which is where they'll shoot missiles,

706
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:57,992
and they give a precise position where the friends are,

707
00:41:58,226 --> 00:42:01,059
and they will give a precise position where the foes are.

708
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:04,229
And these missiles will sometimes come in 50 feet, 20 feet,

709
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,478
that's why they call it "danger close" there.

710
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:10,572
You know, sometimes you think we're "movie-ising" this thing up

711
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,409
where the guys are coming in with,

712
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:16,968
I guess, those laser-sighting things on their guns.

713
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:19,551
That's called marking a target.

714
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,179
Hey! Make way!

715
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,111
- What is that?
- I don't know.

716
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,088
We need air support and we need it now.

717
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,288
Roll in strike package Bravo on unknown target.

718
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,993
<i>I authenticate Tango Whiskey at time 0300 Zulu.</i>

719
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,934
<i>Attention, all aircraft. This will be a danger close-fire mission.</i>

720
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:59,132
These guys on the AWACS, that was done on Edwards Air Force Base.

721
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:02,961
I told these guys on the AWACS... These are all the real guys.

722
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,405
I said to the guy in charge of the AWACS, I said,

723
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:07,617
"How would you run this mission?

724
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:08,982
"This is what's going down on the ground.

725
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,279
"This is what's happening."

726
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:13,256
And literally within three minutes, these guys were talking.

727
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:15,459
I did not add one line here.

728
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:18,071
This is exactly how they talked. That's as fast as they talk.

729
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,698
And, literally, we were capturing it like a documentary.

730
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:23,690
It's amazing how fast everyone's talking over each other.

731
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:26,409
And a multitude of things going on.

732
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:27,800
And what's going on, Josh, right now

733
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:33,538
is laser-designating for these missiles coming in right now,

734
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:36,297
and that's actually how it's done.

735
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,724
These Warthogs are, I must say, very, kind of, scary

736
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,743
'cause they've got a very low, kind of, sound to them

737
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:48,231
and they get very low to the ground,

738
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,819
and they're slow enough where you can see them

739
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:54,832
and they just got this evil whine to it, and they're just so deadly, these things.

740
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,068
No frigging way that thing's still not down.

741
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:06,438
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells. Bring the rain.

742
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,082
<i>Be advised, ground team is requesting 105 sabot rounds.</i>

743
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:15,030
Skorponok was our first scene that we shot

744
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:18,108
and it was one of the first scenes that was kind of digitally completed.

745
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:23,877
And that was kind of, I guess, the basis of how these Transformers should look.

746
00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:28,403
I started showing some of my friends this scene and everyone kept saying,

747
00:44:28,668 --> 00:44:30,340
"Well, what is it, an animation? What is it?"

748
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:31,538
And then I'd show them this scene

749
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:33,184
and then instantly, this is a scene they go,

750
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,729
"I get it. I understand the movie now."

751
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:39,201
"You're doing this kind of in a real-life way."

752
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:45,538
And it's got fun, and, you know, it's kind of sci-fi.

753
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:49,364
So I guess this is when we started convincing a lot of people.

754
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,200
Like even the Japanese came in, the Toho distributors.

755
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,632
I had to do a lot of dog-and-pony shows for a lot of people

756
00:44:56,905 --> 00:45:03,344
because we were, I guess, one of the very few non-sequels of the summer,

757
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,388
and we had to kind of position ourselves.

758
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:07,696
And a lot of theatre owners,

759
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:10,426
"Well, what is Transformers? I don't get it."

760
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:13,585
So we did this little compilation reel of 20 minutes,

761
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:17,350
and it's something that we started showing around to theatre owners

762
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,066
and to try to get people on board, to understand what we have here.

763
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,224
Because everyone thought this is, kind of,

764
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,905
"What is it, silly?" "Is it animation?" Is it this, is it that?

765
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:28,740
We started showing people this.

766
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:30,533
Like, for example, Toho,

767
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:34,125
which is the biggest movie distributor ownership in Japan,

768
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:36,748
which is a gigantic market.

769
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:39,300
They came into my trailer, l showed them 20 minutes of stuff,

770
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,481
and, literally, you just heard the word...

771
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:44,817
And I guess that meant "Good" in Japanese.

772
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:46,314
They upped our estimate,

773
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:49,173
they doubled our estimate of what we're gonna make in Japan,

774
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:51,604
and they gave us the number one house...

775
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:55,786
Toho, I guess, chain in Japan.

776
00:45:57,382 --> 00:46:02,058
But that reel was a way to really get people on board with this movie,

777
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:07,529
you know, 'cause I kind of knew what we had early on,

778
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:12,728
and I remember going in to see my very first fight in Vegas.

779
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:15,290
A live fight. It was Oscar de la Hoya.

780
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:20,238
And I walked in and there was Peter Chernin, who I'm friendly with,

781
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,125
and, you know, good jovial fun, he's walking in with his friend.

782
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:26,244
And he goes, "So, I hear you got Transformers."

783
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,447
And I said, "So, I hear you got Die Hard!"

784
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:31,010
And I'm, like, "Yeah, they're the same date."

785
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:34,563
And I just kind of said, "Yeah, but you'll move, don't worry."

786
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:36,147
And, of course, they moved.

787
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:38,571
You know, it's kind of a game of chicken.

788
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:41,715
I think they saw our second teaser.

789
00:46:41,926 --> 00:46:45,805
We wanted it to be a hard-edged teaser, 'cause we wanted to show the fans

790
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:48,968
that we're gonna do a serious, cool Transformer movie

791
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:50,822
and we weren't making it too kiddy,

792
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:57,371
and it was going to appeal to the 30-year-old guy and girl

793
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:00,646
that, you know, grew up with Transformers,

794
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:05,697
as well as the younger kids that are just getting into it.

795
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:11,327
Looks like there's a message embedded in the signal. Let me work my magic.

796
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,025
"Project Iceman"?

797
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,537
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

798
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,380
Are you playing those video games again?

799
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:31,143
You can tell right here, I mean this guy, Omar, right there,

800
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:32,628
he wasn't in the script,

801
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:35,647
but I always add weird stuff like this right here... going through glass.

802
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:38,688
Why are we doing that? I don't know, it's funny, all right?

803
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,777
That's just my humor.

804
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,059
So this is where the studio goes,

805
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:45,631
"What are you doing? Is this director out of his mind?"

806
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:48,618
But in every single movie theatre,

807
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:52,342
I've seen it around the world, they all laugh.

808
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,491
You know, what can I tell you?

809
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,466
<i>We're not told where they're going.</i>

810
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:00,565
Morning, Mo.

811
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,975
<i>The government has been very quiet about what's going on but in our...</i>

812
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,707
<i>- Mojo. Mojo.
- They were headed directly</i>

813
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,339
<i>towards North Korea.</i>

814
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,800
Stop with the barking, Mojo. It's too early. Please?

815
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:11,277
We had $145 million to make this movie.

816
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:12,748
It doesn't sound like a lot.

817
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:15,360
I mean, it sounds like a lot, but it's really not.

818
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:18,315
When you look at some of these movies like Pirates, which is $350

819
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:21,037
and Spider-Man which is $325,

820
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:24,704
I don't even know how you spend that much money on a movie.

821
00:48:24,946 --> 00:48:26,664
I'm really proud of the fact that we did this movie

822
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:30,259
for ultimately $151 at the end of the day.

823
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:34,209
We were very judicious about where we used the effects.

824
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:36,484
And I must say a lot of that is attributed to Steven,

825
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,463
'cause Steven would put the reins on me.

826
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:42,301
I mean, literally, Steven is very, very tough about budget.

827
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:47,496
He wanted me to think really hard about how many effects I used

828
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:49,918
and to use them and choose them wisely.

829
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:53,133
He would say, like, "Listen, when I did Jurassic Park,

830
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,946
"it was only 50-something effects, and we all remember it as more.

831
00:48:58,229 --> 00:49:01,426
"When I did War of the Worlds, it was only 117 effects."

832
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,562
I kind of thought, "Are you kidding? I would think it'd be more than that."

833
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:08,054
So he really got me to thinking how to use my effects wisely

834
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:09,999
'cause they can get very pricey

835
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:13,912
and that's why the budget can just balloon.

836
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:17,040
So I literally animaticked the whole movie, in terms of every scene

837
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:18,761
where we were gonna do big effects.

838
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:22,466
Literally, a lot of these effects in the movie are exactly how we did them

839
00:49:22,712 --> 00:49:25,704
in our little MlLE files in my office.

840
00:49:26,716 --> 00:49:30,231
I started to get excited about potentially what I can visually show.

841
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,304
Like this shot right here of Shia going in, this whole scene.

842
00:49:35,016 --> 00:49:40,488
A kid on his stupid mom's bike that is now gonna confront a monster.

843
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:42,770
I kept thinking this could be a movie...

844
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:45,853
Every kid has to have a movie that they own, you know.

845
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:49,300
With me growing up, it was like ET.

846
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:52,489
and really, like, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars.

847
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,419
Those were two movies that kind of...

848
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:58,570
There are seminal moments in my childhood of cool movies I saw,

849
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:03,348
and that's what I wanted this movie to be for kids.

850
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:08,572
You know, it's something new and different that they can discover.

851
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,994
It's not a repeat of something.

852
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:14,765
You know, I can't tell you how many kids have come up to me

853
00:50:15,056 --> 00:50:17,695
saying, "It's my favorite movie I've ever seen!

854
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:20,452
"I love Transformers! I can't wait to see Transformers 2!"

855
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:25,116
You know, this is why you do movies, and I think people responded to it

856
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,628
because it was kind of new and different.

857
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:31,725
And, well, what I'm really surprised about

858
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:35,183
is the massive age range this movie had,

859
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:39,119
from 50, 60-year-olds to, I mean, young four-year-olds.

860
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:41,806
I don't get that. I don't see how four-year-olds can see this movie

861
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,753
and not think it's too scary or whatnot.

862
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:48,431
I don't know if I really believe in parents bringing their kids to a movie like this

863
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:49,708
when they're that young.

864
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:54,232
I think what really inspired me to do this movie were not only animatics

865
00:50:54,512 --> 00:50:55,786
but the illustrations.

866
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,002
The movie started to become more real, and there's a charm about the movie.

867
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:04,542
I like this whole magic of these two kids kind of discovering these things.

868
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:13,130
And, you know, my favorite scene, I think, in this movie is...

869
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:18,605
It's kind of ironic. Thinking back, it's like all my movies, like, first hour in,

870
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,585
there was always one montage. That kind of...

871
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,258
You can kind of see this in all my movies like The Rock.

872
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:26,609
Sean Connery and Nic Cage breaking in into the Rock,

873
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:31,186
and then Armageddon, the astronauts lifting off

874
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:36,149
or Pearl Harbor, the Japanese kind of getting ready to attack

875
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:42,020
or the asteroids coming in and landing and the kids meeting the Autobots.

876
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:46,140
I kind of have a theme, I guess, in my movies.

877
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:50,387
I do these montages that really inspire me,

878
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,204
and they always seem to happen an hour in.

879
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:54,804
But that's kind of my favorite scene,

880
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:58,623
when we see Optimus kind of transform in front of the kids.

881
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:01,123
Oh, God! We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

882
00:52:01,228 --> 00:52:02,786
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

883
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:05,194
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

884
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:06,852
So when we're doing scenes like this,

885
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:09,515
I'm sometimes, often times, in the car with Shia and Megan,

886
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:11,430
and we're driving with the stunt driver,

887
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:13,386
and we're driving very fast and controlled,

888
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:17,667
but it really gets your adrenalin going, I must say.

889
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,586
We're locked in.

890
00:52:37,097 --> 00:52:40,533
The car won't start. At least we ditched the monster, right?

891
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:53,225
Shia always says I'm the director that will put my knee pads on,

892
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:56,384
I'll be right next to the actors.

893
00:52:56,592 --> 00:53:00,824
When I do action...Oh, God, you hear these rumors.

894
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:02,815
It's the kind they love to just get onto the...

895
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:06,682
"Michael yells." "Michael's a screamer." Blah, blah, blah.

896
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:11,851
No, Michael's like a tough-ass basketball coach

897
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:15,027
that is in your face, especially when you're doing action.

898
00:53:15,236 --> 00:53:16,555
For one, because of safety,

899
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:19,209
two, because I'm trying to get your adrenalin level

900
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:22,399
where I think it needs to be for that scene.

901
00:53:22,618 --> 00:53:23,892
How many action scenes do you see

902
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:27,995
where it seems like actors are just kind of walking through it?

903
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:32,128
I really want that adrenalin to be real, and I want you to look energized.

904
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:36,132
So that's kind of how I work, you know?

905
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:42,218
So the screaming only comes, I guess, when I'm doing tough action,

906
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:45,149
and I want you to get to that energy level, you know.

907
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:48,500
And it's also, a lot of these times,

908
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:53,006
I'm very safety-conscious, and I take it personally,

909
00:53:53,274 --> 00:53:55,788
and I'm like my own A. D. on my sets.

910
00:53:55,985 --> 00:54:01,457
I work with an A. D. , I worked with Simon this time,

911
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:06,458
but I move my sets forward for myself,

912
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:10,216
and I want everyone to know what I'm thinking and I'm vocal about it.

913
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,210
Like, "We're moving over here! We're coming over here!"

914
00:54:12,376 --> 00:54:16,005
And so I've got a good projecting voice that, you know, like,

915
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:19,372
"Let's get our day done, and let's, like, do it."

916
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:22,868
Granted, I like to laugh just like the next guy, and I tease.

917
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:25,484
I am a professional teaser with my crew.

918
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:28,354
And it's funny when you see new crew members come on.

919
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,436
They're day players, whatever, and I'm teasing,

920
00:54:30,603 --> 00:54:34,118
'cause I'll act it like I really mean it.

921
00:54:34,356 --> 00:54:36,312
I'm totally screwing around with people,

922
00:54:36,484 --> 00:54:39,521
but my crew that's been with me for 1 6 years,

923
00:54:39,737 --> 00:54:42,171
they all know that I'm screwing around with you.

924
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:45,197
But I like picking on people, and I like being picked on, too,

925
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:48,526
just as long as you're good at picking on people. It's fun.

926
00:54:48,746 --> 00:54:52,102
But I do like to have a good environment on the set

927
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:57,221
and especially work with people that I really like being around

928
00:54:57,463 --> 00:55:02,491
that look at it as a career, not as a job.

929
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:06,085
Because, let me tell you, I know everyone's job on this set.

930
00:55:06,263 --> 00:55:09,653
I've been doing this since I'm 24,

931
00:55:09,892 --> 00:55:13,407
and I will be the first to point out to you when you're not doing a good job.

932
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:16,080
But you know what?

933
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:21,002
A director's only as good as his or her crew,

934
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:26,265
and the studio wanted to ship me off to Australia, then to Canada.

935
00:55:26,575 --> 00:55:29,772
We went to check out Canada. I felt Australia was too far away.

936
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:32,634
And we went up to Canada and I just, like, "Oh, my God..."

937
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:34,868
I was trying to make it work, trying to make it work.

938
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:38,079
Looking around, scouting, and l realized this will be a waste of money.

939
00:55:38,295 --> 00:55:41,492
It'll just be...

940
00:55:41,715 --> 00:55:45,913
There's no way the crew can do the serious kind of stunt work

941
00:55:46,178 --> 00:55:49,773
that we really do on our sets,

942
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,813
'cause they just don't have a lot of great stunt work up there,

943
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:56,772
and you gotta ship in too many people, and it just would be a lost cause.

944
00:55:57,022 --> 00:56:00,901
And so the studio gave me some grief for not going up there.

945
00:56:01,152 --> 00:56:06,670
So I ended up giving 30% of my fees so I can shoot with my crew in America,

946
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:12,429
and that's because I'm loyal to my crew, and they're just, I think, the best.

947
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:14,218
Visitors from heaven? What...

948
00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:16,979
What are you, like, an alien or something?

949
00:56:22,131 --> 00:56:24,884
The sound work was done by Ethan Van der Ryn and Mike Hopkins

950
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:31,042
who did the sound work for Lord of the Rings and King Kong.

951
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:37,367
Mike is from New Zealand, Ethan was trained up at Lucasfilm.

952
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:40,043
And I must say, awesome sound.

953
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,506
When you listen on this DVD, it is just awesome sound.

954
00:56:44,737 --> 00:56:48,525
My mixers, Kevin O'Connell and Greg Russell...

955
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:52,378
Kevin, by the way, is the biggest Academy loser in Academy history.

956
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,612
He's lost, I think, 20 times.

957
00:56:56,749 --> 00:56:59,422
He's done some amazing movies. He's an amazing mixer.

958
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:01,822
As a team, they're amazing mixers.

959
00:57:02,004 --> 00:57:06,361
And Kevin and Greg said to me, in all their time on mixing,

960
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:11,105
they felt this was the most inventive sound work they've ever worked with.

961
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:14,186
And, meanwhile, they feel it's one of their finest sound designs

962
00:57:14,392 --> 00:57:17,987
and mixing efforts that they've done as of yet.

963
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:21,938
We had to invent so many different sounds here,

964
00:57:22,191 --> 00:57:24,944
and it just gives these robots such personality,

965
00:57:25,152 --> 00:57:29,509
and it's really just a launching pad for where we can go on number two.

966
00:57:31,591 --> 00:57:32,990
- Yeah, all right. - Right?

967
00:57:33,093 --> 00:57:34,651
- Yeah.
- Okay.

968
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,121
There, see? That's better.

969
00:57:39,432 --> 00:57:40,831
- Okay.
- Okay.

970
00:57:44,537 --> 00:57:47,904
You know, that seat belt thing was a pretty smooth move.

971
00:57:48,975 --> 00:57:49,942
Thank you.

972
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:53,138
You know what I don't understand?

973
00:57:53,246 --> 00:57:56,306
Why, if he's supposed to be, like, this super-advanced robot,

974
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:59,010
does he transform back into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

975
00:57:59,729 --> 00:58:02,004
I have no idea why this scene right here,

976
00:58:02,189 --> 00:58:06,307
and I've seen this movie from Korea to Australia, all over Europe,

977
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:14,187
America, just why right here in the movie,

978
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:17,690
they applaud when this yellow car comes up.

979
00:58:17,913 --> 00:58:20,222
Oh, that shot. Let me tell you about that shot right there.

980
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:22,771
That was the most patient I've ever been

981
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,270
for doing a stunt in the history of my career.

982
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:30,134
That took exactly three and half hours for that guy to go up on two wheels.

983
00:58:30,384 --> 00:58:31,533
Why was he on two wheels?

984
00:58:31,677 --> 00:58:33,907
Well, he was on two wheels because, I don't know,

985
00:58:34,096 --> 00:58:35,529
I wanted the guy up on two wheels

986
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:39,560
and, you know, wanted to go old school with the stunt there.

987
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:44,095
That Camaro was a prototype that I saw

988
00:58:45,149 --> 00:58:46,343
when I was looking through all these car companies,

989
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:48,600
new kind of prototypes that were coming out.

990
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:51,372
Then I saw this at the skunk works at GM,

991
00:58:51,572 --> 00:58:53,608
this little, kind of secret building in California

992
00:58:53,783 --> 00:58:56,377
where they do kind of these concept cars,

993
00:58:56,577 --> 00:58:58,215
and I kind of knew right away that was the car.

994
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,201
That was gonna be Bumblebee,

995
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:03,045
and the fans were gonna give me grief because it wasn't a Volkswagen,

996
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:08,722
but there's just no way I could do this movie if this was a VW bug.

997
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:16,052
And so I just felt that was the car.

998
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:38,787
So there's a scene with this little girl in her bed.

999
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:44,452
And, you know, this girl was five,

1000
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,299
and I actually hired two of them for the exact same scene,

1001
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:51,504
and I shot one shot with one and another one literally with the other girl,

1002
00:59:51,715 --> 00:59:54,991
and we were like flipping back and forth, 'cause I knew...

1003
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:59,045
The studio teacher that comes with the kid

1004
00:59:59,223 --> 01:00:02,818
is a kind of a social worker that watches the kids.

1005
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,335
She said, "I've never seen a director in my 20 years

1006
01:00:05,521 --> 01:00:07,716
"ever hire two girls for the same role."

1007
01:00:07,898 --> 01:00:09,809
I said, "Well, at 11:30 at night,

1008
01:00:09,984 --> 01:00:12,578
"when we have 20 minutes left on our time,

1009
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:15,292
"where you have to take the kids, we're doing the most important shot

1010
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:16,922
"with this robot getting out of the pool,

1011
01:00:17,074 --> 01:00:19,542
"and I guarantee you, one of them will crap out."

1012
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:24,022
And sure enough, by the time we got to the pool, one of them had crapped out.

1013
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:27,123
And so we used the little blond girl.

1014
01:00:29,128 --> 01:00:30,959
This was a fun night for the crew, I must say,

1015
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,167
because we're up there at this house, it's 8:00 at night,

1016
01:00:34,383 --> 01:00:37,102
and I said to the guy, "So what crane do we have?"

1017
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:41,421
And everyone kind of looked at me. It was like the silent look.

1018
01:00:41,682 --> 01:00:43,161
"Crane?"

1019
01:00:44,602 --> 01:00:47,196
"Well, guys, you saw the animatic, what we need to do, right?

1020
01:00:47,396 --> 01:00:50,229
"We have to move this, like, long move, and whatever."

1021
01:00:50,441 --> 01:00:53,353
Well, let me tell you, they called every place around Hollywood.

1022
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:56,402
I don't know how they manufactured this weird-ass crane,

1023
01:00:56,614 --> 01:00:58,570
but anyway, we got to do this shot.

1024
01:00:58,741 --> 01:01:00,891
And this was our very first take with the girl.

1025
01:01:01,077 --> 01:01:04,956
Now it's very hard, 'cause she has to follow this pole above her six times

1026
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:08,243
and right there when she does that little stutter step, I just loved it,

1027
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:11,337
'cause she tripped and it just looked more real.

1028
01:01:12,296 --> 01:01:14,287
And lLM said, "Whoa! Let's use the other shot

1029
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:15,784
"'cause she looks like she screwed up."

1030
01:01:15,925 --> 01:01:20,282
I said, "That's what it's about. It's about a kid screwing up. That's what it is."

1031
01:01:40,074 --> 01:01:43,589
Now the concept car, 'cause we only had one in the world,

1032
01:01:43,828 --> 01:01:45,580
we had to actually build it.

1033
01:01:45,746 --> 01:01:48,055
And once we got the CAD files and the okay...

1034
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:50,126
It's very hard to get CAD files from a car company

1035
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:53,250
because of thievery or whatever they call it.

1036
01:02:16,861 --> 01:02:19,819
This shot right here with Optimus transforming,

1037
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:23,306
this is one of the shots we made very early on in the animatic process

1038
01:02:23,534 --> 01:02:25,923
that got me excited about the movie.

1039
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:32,275
This is almost verbatim to our animatic that we created in my office.

1040
01:02:33,544 --> 01:02:36,502
I think this moment right here when I finally heard all the sounds

1041
01:02:36,714 --> 01:02:40,423
with Peter Cullen's amazing voice.

1042
01:02:40,676 --> 01:02:42,394
Thank God the fans actually...

1043
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:44,350
I kept listening to fans, and they were right.

1044
01:02:44,513 --> 01:02:46,549
You guys were right all the way through.

1045
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:50,876
But I just wanted to have an open mind of who can play these robots, so...

1046
01:02:51,145 --> 01:02:52,783
You know you can't fault me for that.

1047
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:56,248
But that was Optimus Prime. When he speaks, let me tell you...

1048
01:02:56,484 --> 01:03:00,477
But when Ethan and Mike added those sounds to Optimus,

1049
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:03,650
it just made it come to life.

1050
01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:06,619
You know when you look at these effects right here, it's just so real

1051
01:03:06,827 --> 01:03:10,706
in terms of the reflections of the metal and how they fit in.

1052
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,996
- But you can call us Autobots for short. - Autobots.

1053
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:18,466
- What's cracking, little bitches? - My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

1054
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:22,098
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

1055
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:24,540
What is that? How did he learn to talk like that?

1056
01:03:24,644 --> 01:03:28,239
We've learned Earth's languages through the World Wide Web.

1057
01:03:29,749 --> 01:03:32,217
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

1058
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,680
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

1059
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:40,020
Just kidding. I just wanted to show him my cannons.

1060
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:44,494
You know, there's the whole thing about Transformers about mass-shifting,

1061
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:48,176
and to me, that was just always a complex thing.

1062
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:52,609
It was very hard to get across in movie-making,

1063
01:03:52,873 --> 01:03:57,344
and I wanted to keep the idea of the robots.

1064
01:03:57,628 --> 01:04:01,223
If you're coming from a vehicle, you've gotta kind of stay that same size

1065
01:04:01,465 --> 01:04:04,218
of whatever that vehicle you could possibly stretch it out to.

1066
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:05,780
So, yeah, I got some flak about

1067
01:04:05,928 --> 01:04:11,958
changing Optimus from a flat-nose to a long-nose,

1068
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:16,719
and the long-nose just made him so he can be 28 feet

1069
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:22,692
instead of the 20 feet that he would've been with a flat-nose truck.

1070
01:04:23,028 --> 01:04:26,657
And, you know, I got a lot of flak for that.

1071
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:33,638
And then I got more flak for putting flames on Optimus.

1072
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:37,710
Boy, I mean, it was literally... Death threats all started over again,

1073
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:42,875
and the "Damn you, Michael Bay!" And whatever the hell it was.

1074
01:04:43,174 --> 01:04:45,051
I mean it's just, you know, I wanted flames.

1075
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:46,286
I mean, if you want a pink house,

1076
01:04:46,427 --> 01:04:47,621
I want a green house. What's the difference?

1077
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:50,196
I'm the director, and, it's just, that's what I wanted.

1078
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:54,507
And I knew the flames were barely visible

1079
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:56,646
when you saw him when he was transformed,

1080
01:04:56,812 --> 01:05:00,168
and it kind of gave the impression that he had ribs.

1081
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,188
And it was a picture of a truck that I saw, and I wanted to copy it.

1082
01:05:05,446 --> 01:05:07,562
And I must say,

1083
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,335
I went to my teamster captain,

1084
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:16,332
and I said... They're in charge of painting vehicles, and I said,

1085
01:05:16,624 --> 01:05:20,663
"I'm telling you, a white guy is not allowed to paint those flames, okay?

1086
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,957
"I want, what we call in LA, I want a cholo.

1087
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:26,562
"I want a guy who is an artist

1088
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:29,512
"who knows how to do these amazing kind of cholo cars.

1089
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,154
"It's art. Find him, all right?"

1090
01:05:32,348 --> 01:05:36,023
And so the funniest picture I got in this entire movie was our guy.

1091
01:05:36,268 --> 01:05:39,783
He's from Mexico. He had a cup of coffee with his hat backwards.

1092
01:05:40,022 --> 01:05:43,617
He's sitting in the art kitchen. They took a picture of him and said,

1093
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:45,008
"Here he is. This is your guy.

1094
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:47,950
"He doesn't speak any English. We're gonna use an interpreter.

1095
01:05:48,155 --> 01:05:49,554
"But he does amazing flames."

1096
01:05:49,698 --> 01:05:54,135
And I gotta tell you, they were the most beautiful flames I've ever seen.

1097
01:05:55,294 --> 01:05:59,697
<i>He accidentally activated his navigation system.</i>

1098
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:19,115
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

1099
01:06:19,218 --> 01:06:21,243
How'd you know about his glasses?

1100
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:22,284
eBay.

1101
01:06:22,523 --> 01:06:25,162
I must say, I did audition Peter Cullen twice.

1102
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:30,433
They wanted me to go with Frank Welker for Megatron.

1103
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:36,690
To me, Frank Welker, great voice artist, but it just sounded too cartoon to me,

1104
01:06:37,037 --> 01:06:41,827
and I don't think I could really tell Frank to change it for this movie.

1105
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:44,845
It just wouldn't feel right.

1106
01:06:46,464 --> 01:06:47,783
So early on in the process

1107
01:06:48,924 --> 01:06:50,994
when I picked certain actors

1108
01:06:51,177 --> 01:06:55,250
to be what I would interpret that character to be...

1109
01:06:55,514 --> 01:06:59,223
Like, let me give you an idea. Liam Neeson was Optimus Prime,

1110
01:06:59,477 --> 01:07:02,469
Michael J. Fox was Bumblebee,

1111
01:07:02,688 --> 01:07:04,963
Hugo Weaving was Megatron.

1112
01:07:05,149 --> 01:07:07,185
And, you know, just in terms of movies

1113
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:11,318
that I wanted the artist to look at, to kind of emulate,

1114
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:13,608
not the way they move, but just how regal,

1115
01:07:13,783 --> 01:07:17,571
like, Liam Neeson is, to, you know, Hugo Weaving.

1116
01:07:17,828 --> 01:07:21,901
And it's just his voice, Hugo's voice just kept sticking in my head for Megatron.

1117
01:07:25,294 --> 01:07:27,649
One of my producers, Lorenzo di Bonaventura,

1118
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:31,513
who used to run Warner Brothers, he did the Matrix movies.

1119
01:07:31,759 --> 01:07:34,671
And he called Hugo and got him into doing this,

1120
01:07:34,887 --> 01:07:39,403
and Hugo was down in Australia and l was directing him from here via iChat

1121
01:07:39,683 --> 01:07:41,401
and they had the movie down there,

1122
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,154
and it was amazing how I was able to direct him so far away

1123
01:07:44,355 --> 01:07:45,629
in modern technology.

1124
01:07:45,773 --> 01:07:49,243
But he just has an awesome voice for Megatron.

1125
01:08:05,524 --> 01:08:08,550
She did it! She did it! She's the one you want! All right?

1126
01:08:08,661 --> 01:08:10,288
I was just sitting at home watching cartoons,

1127
01:08:10,396 --> 01:08:12,387
playing video games with my cousin, and she came in there.

1128
01:08:12,498 --> 01:08:13,465
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

1129
01:08:13,566 --> 01:08:15,796
Hey! I am not going to jail for you or anybody else!

1130
01:08:15,902 --> 01:08:20,601
I have done nothing bad my entire life! Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

1131
01:08:20,706 --> 01:08:21,673
Okay, so what?

1132
01:08:21,774 --> 01:08:23,867
I've downloaded a couple of thousand songs off the Internet.

1133
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:25,671
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

1134
01:08:25,778 --> 01:08:26,745
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

1135
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:30,680
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me, criminal!

1136
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:33,090
So I never get sick when I shoot.

1137
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,395
You just kind of have this adrenalin that carries you

1138
01:08:35,573 --> 01:08:41,364
for a full year-and-a-half, two years through a movie.

1139
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:46,998
But one day I had a little vacation down in Cabo,

1140
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:51,529
'cause I guess there was a union break we had,

1141
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:58,050
and I leaned down in the elevator of Air Force One, I'm like, "Uh-oh!

1142
01:08:58,304 --> 01:09:00,772
"Maybe we got a little Cabo-Wabo something going on there."

1143
01:09:00,973 --> 01:09:06,093
And within an hour, I just got violently sick with the flu,

1144
01:09:06,395 --> 01:09:09,068
and I'm sitting in my chair, and I'm shaking and I'm sweating,

1145
01:09:09,273 --> 01:09:12,071
and I'm like, "I'm okay, I can direct. I'm okay, I'm okay."

1146
01:09:12,276 --> 01:09:14,471
And you know how you get when you get fluey.

1147
01:09:14,653 --> 01:09:18,202
So I went outside of the trailer, and I had to lie down on the asphalt

1148
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:20,440
'cause I was so cold. I'm shivering.

1149
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:23,371
And my producer, Ian Bryce, is standing there and says, "Buddy, you gotta go."

1150
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:26,377
I said, "No, no, I've never gone home ever, ever in my career,

1151
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:29,380
"ever gone home sick. No, I'm not going home."

1152
01:09:29,585 --> 01:09:33,624
And then we had some gigantic days like, literally, two days away,

1153
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:37,112
we had to shoot downtown at the cost of, like, $375 each,

1154
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:42,212
and it's a big deal to shut all that stuff downtown.

1155
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:44,983
And then the set doctor came by and she says,

1156
01:09:45,184 --> 01:09:48,415
"You got 102-and-a-half. You gotta go home," so...

1157
01:09:49,605 --> 01:09:53,120
Anyway, I kicked it kind of, sort of, like the next day, or whatever,

1158
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,793
but I was sick and kind of whatever,

1159
01:09:55,986 --> 01:10:00,696
and I had to direct in my trailer, so they had a microphone.

1160
01:10:00,991 --> 01:10:04,222
And I was kind of like Coppola in the Silverfish where he would direct,

1161
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:06,045
but he had a Jacuzzi in his.

1162
01:10:06,205 --> 01:10:07,479
But I was trying to direct my crew

1163
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:10,262
and they were so slow without me on the set.

1164
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:15,658
We went from 50-something set-ups a day to 1 5, and I'm on a microphone,

1165
01:10:15,965 --> 01:10:19,753
and it was just like, "Guys, you are so slow. What's going on?"

1166
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:21,489
It was pretty funny.

1167
01:10:21,594 --> 01:10:22,520
One more thing, huh?

1168
01:10:22,628 --> 01:10:25,688
All right, I love you! Sleep good, handsome man!

1169
01:10:26,732 --> 01:10:27,892
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1170
01:10:28,034 --> 01:10:31,299
No, watch the path! Watch the path! Watch the... Please, please, please.

1171
01:10:31,404 --> 01:10:34,271
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

1172
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:36,807
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

1173
01:10:36,909 --> 01:10:38,877
You couldn't wait for five... You couldn't wait for five minutes?

1174
01:10:38,978 --> 01:10:41,811
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

1175
01:10:45,084 --> 01:10:47,075
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

1176
01:10:47,186 --> 01:10:51,179
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

1177
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:54,857
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

1178
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:57,986
- Oh, wet. - No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

1179
01:10:58,097 --> 01:11:00,861
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo. This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

1180
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:03,764
He's a pet. Okay? That's all. If you could just put the guns away...

1181
01:11:03,869 --> 01:11:06,838
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

1182
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:08,133
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

1183
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,401
No, no, no, no. He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

1184
01:11:10,509 --> 01:11:13,706
This is my... This is my Chihuahua. We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

1185
01:11:13,856 --> 01:11:15,972
So, you know, working on these scenes,

1186
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:20,541
they are looking at literally window washer poles with different heights.

1187
01:11:20,821 --> 01:11:24,291
And those arms we had two window washer poles with tennis balls on them

1188
01:11:24,533 --> 01:11:27,764
so that they can actually kind of have an eye line to watch.

1189
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:33,201
It makes it kind of hard

1190
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:35,894
when you're trying to do camera moves without things there

1191
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:38,647
and trying to imagine what fits in.

1192
01:11:38,839 --> 01:11:42,070
That's why the animatics were huge helps for the actor to see.

1193
01:11:43,094 --> 01:11:46,484
There are times like this, this is a shot I made up on the fly,

1194
01:11:46,722 --> 01:11:48,872
just having Optimus look in.

1195
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,177
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

1196
01:11:53,919 --> 01:11:56,479
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1197
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:00,184
Come on, come on.

1198
01:12:06,117 --> 01:12:08,585
I always do these crazy things, like, this should've been a set,

1199
01:12:08,786 --> 01:12:12,620
but I like shooting in a real house where I have the access to the outside.

1200
01:12:13,999 --> 01:12:17,878
The houses are always way too small, locations are small.

1201
01:12:18,129 --> 01:12:20,723
Sometimes locations just feel better to me.

1202
01:12:20,923 --> 01:12:24,393
And even though this is a minuscule room we're shooting in

1203
01:12:24,635 --> 01:12:26,785
with a crew. It's sometimes ridiculous.

1204
01:12:27,888 --> 01:12:29,082
Right there, she grabbed that box.

1205
01:12:29,223 --> 01:12:30,815
That was kind of an improve thing. And he ran over.

1206
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:34,206
I mean, that's got to be his porn box, I would think, you know.

1207
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:35,950
Every boy's got that somewhere in the room,

1208
01:12:36,105 --> 01:12:38,778
and guess we all understand that, don't we?

1209
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,323
Okay. What now?

1210
01:12:44,737 --> 01:12:48,173
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1211
01:12:48,274 --> 01:12:52,233
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding. This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1212
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:53,333
Oh, God. Oh!

1213
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:57,575
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed right here and now it's gone.</i>

1214
01:12:57,683 --> 01:12:59,981
<i>My moped's under there, man! Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

1215
01:13:01,453 --> 01:13:03,182
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1216
01:13:03,289 --> 01:13:06,224
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1217
01:13:06,325 --> 01:13:07,917
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1218
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:09,085
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1219
01:13:09,195 --> 01:13:10,423
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1220
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:12,520
If my parents come out here and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1221
01:13:12,631 --> 01:13:14,098
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1222
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,758
We must have the glasses.

1223
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:17,426
I know you need the glasses. I've been looking everywhere.

1224
01:13:17,536 --> 01:13:19,766
They're not here. They're definitely not here.

1225
01:13:19,872 --> 01:13:20,964
Keep searching.

1226
01:13:21,734 --> 01:13:24,692
The way we'd get facial emotions like this from Optimus, I'd actually...

1227
01:13:24,904 --> 01:13:27,418
The animators up north or down here at DD

1228
01:13:27,615 --> 01:13:30,573
would kind of imitate something, video themselves or whatnot,

1229
01:13:30,785 --> 01:13:33,424
and then they'd kind of animate how that would work.

1230
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:36,135
Or we'd actually use actors to do certain things.

1231
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:39,290
We wouldn't use motion capture like you would here...

1232
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:48,430
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move, move! Earthquake!

1233
01:13:48,534 --> 01:13:52,398
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it! Duck and cover right now!

1234
01:13:52,504 --> 01:13:54,335
How did you get over there so fast?

1235
01:13:55,407 --> 01:13:57,170
Wow! That was tingly!

1236
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:00,677
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

1237
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:07,542
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1238
01:14:09,955 --> 01:14:12,651
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1239
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:15,221
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1240
01:14:15,361 --> 01:14:17,056
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

1241
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:19,722
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1242
01:14:19,832 --> 01:14:20,890
What's with the light? You gotta stop the light.

1243
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,900
What's going on? Turn it off. You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1244
01:14:23,002 --> 01:14:24,162
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

1245
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:25,328
How come the door's locked?

1246
01:14:25,437 --> 01:14:29,066
You know the rules. No doors locked in my house!

1247
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:30,368
You know he'll start counting

1248
01:14:30,476 --> 01:14:31,875
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1249
01:14:31,977 --> 01:14:32,966
Oh, dear.

1250
01:14:33,078 --> 01:14:34,807
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

1251
01:14:34,947 --> 01:14:36,312
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

1252
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,382
- Oh, my.
- Two.

1253
01:14:37,483 --> 01:14:39,542
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1254
01:14:40,052 --> 01:14:43,715
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1255
01:14:43,822 --> 01:14:46,814
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1256
01:14:46,925 --> 01:14:48,517
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1257
01:14:48,627 --> 01:14:50,857
We heard voices and noises and we thought maybe you were...

1258
01:14:50,963 --> 01:14:52,828
It doesn't matter what we thought. What was that light?

1259
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:54,728
No, what light? What? There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1260
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:56,323
You got two lights in your hand! That's what it is.

1261
01:14:56,435 --> 01:14:57,697
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1262
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:01,034
First time I showed this scene to Steven,

1263
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:03,119
I said, "Steven, I want you to...

1264
01:15:03,294 --> 01:15:05,854
"I'm almost done with my rough cut. I want you to see some scenes."

1265
01:15:06,046 --> 01:15:08,401
He goes, "No, no, no. I want to see the movie when it's all done."

1266
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:10,468
I go, "Come on, Steven, I want you to see this scene."

1267
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:13,068
So he was watching this scene particularly,

1268
01:15:13,262 --> 01:15:15,218
around the house, with the robots around the house.

1269
01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:16,378
And it was hysterical

1270
01:15:16,515 --> 01:15:19,234
because he kept hitting me on the leg and laughing like a kid.

1271
01:15:19,435 --> 01:15:21,153
And I'm like, "What are you doing?"

1272
01:15:21,312 --> 01:15:26,545
And he goes, "I have never seen robots do this."

1273
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:29,054
It was a funny moment

1274
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:32,273
because, considering I filed his Raiders of the Lost Ark storyboards...

1275
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:35,607
And now this guy is slapping me on the leg saying he's never seen robots.

1276
01:15:35,826 --> 01:15:38,499
And I'm like, "You're the dude that's invented dinosaurs,

1277
01:15:38,704 --> 01:15:40,342
"and you've seen everything."

1278
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:44,173
And he goes, "But I've never seen this." So that was kind of a fun moment.

1279
01:15:44,418 --> 01:15:45,487
Also a funny moment,

1280
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:49,667
when we saw the first cut at my house in my screening room,

1281
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:53,234
he kept giving me high fives when he was watching the movie.

1282
01:15:54,178 --> 01:15:57,090
Spielberg giving me high fives when he's watching the movie.

1283
01:15:57,306 --> 01:15:58,534
When a good scene would come on,

1284
01:15:58,682 --> 01:16:01,401
you'd see his arm go up, "Bam!" Another high five.

1285
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,614
But, you know, when I do scenes, I actually...

1286
01:16:05,815 --> 01:16:08,488
When I'm doing the illustration and the animatic process...

1287
01:16:08,692 --> 01:16:09,841
Like, a shot like this.

1288
01:16:09,985 --> 01:16:13,102
This was like a seminal shot you base these scenes around.

1289
01:16:13,322 --> 01:16:15,836
And so this shot was created very early on

1290
01:16:18,369 --> 01:16:22,203
in the animatic process.

1291
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:24,492
Those are the scenes I kind of hang my hat on.

1292
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:27,545
Or those are what the charm of the movie is.

1293
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:28,821
Ironhide, you know we don't harm humans.

1294
01:16:28,927 --> 01:16:30,121
What is with you?

1295
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:33,562
Well, I'm just saying we could. It's an option.

1296
01:16:33,665 --> 01:16:35,326
We heard you talking to somebody, Sam.

1297
01:16:35,434 --> 01:16:37,834
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

1298
01:16:37,936 --> 01:16:39,733
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1299
01:16:40,506 --> 01:16:42,770
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1300
01:16:44,243 --> 01:16:46,973
Gosh, you're gorgeous. Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1301
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:49,946
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

1302
01:16:50,048 --> 01:16:53,108
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to hear our little family discussion about...

1303
01:16:53,218 --> 01:16:54,708
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1304
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,980
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1305
01:17:12,089 --> 01:17:15,604
John Turturro in his character study,

1306
01:17:15,843 --> 01:17:17,720
he kept saying he was trying to imitate me.

1307
01:17:17,887 --> 01:17:20,401
Now, I don't understand how his character

1308
01:17:20,598 --> 01:17:24,307
is even the slightest bit imitating me because that's not who I am.

1309
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,155
But according to him, that's what I am. See, I would never do that.

1310
01:17:33,235 --> 01:17:38,184
John's character, we kind of felt that he was a Sector Seven Agent,

1311
01:17:38,491 --> 01:17:43,201
that his great-great-grandfather was a Sector Seven Agent.

1312
01:17:43,496 --> 01:17:45,930
He's been doing it for generations.

1313
01:17:46,123 --> 01:17:47,442
It was actually in the movie,

1314
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,813
in some of the dialogue, and we actually cut it out,

1315
01:17:50,002 --> 01:17:51,674
made it pretty funny for his character.

1316
01:17:51,837 --> 01:17:55,034
He thinks he still lives with his mom and whatnot.

1317
01:17:56,842 --> 01:17:59,959
He was questioning his sexuality in this movie.

1318
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:02,977
I just didn't think that was really necessary.

1319
01:18:03,182 --> 01:18:04,740
John, I don't think we have to really go there.

1320
01:18:04,892 --> 01:18:06,007
I think you're a guy, okay?

1321
01:18:06,143 --> 01:18:08,976
So just let's keep it at that, all right?

1322
01:18:10,064 --> 01:18:12,624
He was a great delight to work with.

1323
01:18:14,276 --> 01:18:16,710
He has the best Scorsese imitation you have ever seen.

1324
01:18:16,904 --> 01:18:17,973
I think we must have that.

1325
01:18:18,114 --> 01:18:21,424
We must have that somewhere in the making of.

1326
01:18:21,473 --> 01:18:22,840
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

1327
01:18:22,941 --> 01:18:24,169
Whoa, way out of line.

1328
01:18:24,276 --> 01:18:28,303
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1329
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:30,313
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1330
01:18:30,415 --> 01:18:31,473
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1331
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:32,777
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1332
01:18:32,885 --> 01:18:35,080
because there's something fishy going on around here.

1333
01:18:35,187 --> 01:18:37,883
Yeah. There's something a little fishy about you, your son,

1334
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:41,949
your little Taco Bell dog and this whole operation you got going on here.

1335
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,290
- What operation? - That is what we are gonna find out.

1336
01:18:44,396 --> 01:18:46,956
I think direct contact.

1337
01:18:52,404 --> 01:18:53,962
- Son?
- Yeah.

1338
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,941
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

1339
01:19:03,715 --> 01:19:05,182
Fourteen rads.

1340
01:19:06,785 --> 01:19:08,252
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1341
01:19:08,987 --> 01:19:09,887
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1342
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:11,473
I don't know where we found this little dog stick,

1343
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,058
but I just thought that was a funny moment.

1344
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:15,440
"Put that thing around the dog, please."

1345
01:19:15,629 --> 01:19:17,540
Mom walks out and she says, "I'll kick your ass."

1346
01:19:17,715 --> 01:19:19,467
Judy's a funny woman.

1347
01:19:23,168 --> 01:19:26,626
LadiesMan217.

1348
01:19:26,738 --> 01:19:30,174
That is your eBay username, right?

1349
01:19:30,275 --> 01:19:32,607
Yeah, but, you know, it was a typo and I ran with it.

1350
01:19:32,711 --> 01:19:33,678
What do you make of this?

1351
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:36,339
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay? And my...</i>

1352
01:19:36,448 --> 01:19:37,574
Is that you?

1353
01:19:37,683 --> 01:19:39,878
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1354
01:19:39,985 --> 01:19:44,820
Last night at the station, you told the officer your car transformed.

1355
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:48,490
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

1356
01:19:48,594 --> 01:19:53,054
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding that my car had been stolen...

1357
01:19:53,165 --> 01:19:55,292
- Really?
- from me, from my home,

1358
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,369
but it's fine now because it's back! It came back!

1359
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,199
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1360
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:03,741
Because cars don't do that because that would be crazy.

1361
01:20:06,878 --> 01:20:08,470
That's funny. That is so funny.

1362
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,071
So what do you kids know about aliens, huh?

1363
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:15,014
<i>Oh, you mean, like a Martian? Like what, ET.? No.</i>

1364
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,610
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1365
01:20:16,722 --> 01:20:17,848
You see this?

1366
01:20:17,956 --> 01:20:20,550
This is an I-can-do-whatever-l-want and-get-away-with-it badge.

1367
01:20:20,659 --> 01:20:23,423
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1368
01:20:23,528 --> 01:20:24,756
Oh, God. You know what? Don't listen to him.

1369
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:27,263
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to get back to guarding the mall.

1370
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:30,426
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1371
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,628
Especially with your daddy's parole coming up.

1372
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:34,137
What? Parole?

1373
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:37,572
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1374
01:20:37,676 --> 01:20:39,667
You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix?

1375
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:41,507
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1376
01:20:41,613 --> 01:20:42,705
You stole cars?

1377
01:20:42,814 --> 01:20:44,509
Well, we couldn't always afford a babysitter,

1378
01:20:44,616 --> 01:20:46,413
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1379
01:20:46,518 --> 01:20:48,816
She's got her own juvie record to prove it!

1380
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,548
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1381
01:20:52,691 --> 01:20:57,321
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot in jail the rest of his natural life.

1382
01:20:57,429 --> 01:20:59,727
It is time to talk!

1383
01:21:06,471 --> 01:21:07,904
Big! It's big!

1384
01:21:10,703 --> 01:21:13,536
We actually hung these actors on this little contraption

1385
01:21:13,748 --> 01:21:15,340
that would spin them around.

1386
01:21:15,499 --> 01:21:19,333
I got on the car with the operators, and it's quite fun.

1387
01:21:21,672 --> 01:21:25,062
I got to tell you, this stunt, where we strapped cameras, right there, bam,

1388
01:21:25,301 --> 01:21:27,337
that looked like it hurt.

1389
01:21:33,799 --> 01:21:36,097
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1390
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:42,731
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1391
01:21:44,976 --> 01:21:48,742
Taking the children was a bad move.

1392
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:53,178
The scene where we pull the guns out,

1393
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:56,840
look at the driver in the car with John Turturro.

1394
01:21:57,083 --> 01:22:00,120
We had little Jazz here. He uses his magnetic gun right there.

1395
01:22:00,336 --> 01:22:04,295
If you freeze it, watch as the gun... Watch the guns fly up past the guys.

1396
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:07,267
I want you to go back in that DVD and freeze it.

1397
01:22:07,468 --> 01:22:09,982
Because I told the driver, I said, "No, you will not get hurt.

1398
01:22:10,179 --> 01:22:14,377
"They're rubber guns and they're on bungee cords and they're gonna pull."

1399
01:22:14,642 --> 01:22:18,237
If you freeze it, you'll see it hit him kind of on the temple.

1400
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:22,711
He goes, "I thought you said it wasn't gonna hurt." Well, I'm sorry.

1401
01:22:22,946 --> 01:22:26,083
Look, there are S-Seven protocols, okay?

1402
01:22:26,685 --> 01:22:27,982
I'm not authorized to communicate with you

1403
01:22:28,086 --> 01:22:30,316
except to tell you I can't communicate with you.

1404
01:22:30,422 --> 01:22:33,016
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1405
01:22:34,036 --> 01:22:35,992
I don't know, I was kind of crazy when I told the writers,

1406
01:22:36,163 --> 01:22:39,838
I said, "I really want to have Bumblebee piss on John Turturro."

1407
01:22:41,919 --> 01:22:45,229
Call me crazy, but you know what? At least the audiences laughed.

1408
01:22:54,014 --> 01:22:56,847
You know, doing Transformers, I got to tell you,

1409
01:22:57,059 --> 01:23:00,290
a bunch of adults running around the set the first couple of days

1410
01:23:00,521 --> 01:23:03,672
and saying the word "Bumblebee" and "Megatron"...

1411
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:06,493
I remember the first couple of days,

1412
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:11,245
literally about 50 airmen, military extras

1413
01:23:11,532 --> 01:23:14,490
at Holloman Air Force Base

1414
01:23:14,702 --> 01:23:17,455
and I said, "I know, guys, this sounds really stupid,

1415
01:23:17,663 --> 01:23:22,339
"but you're gonna have this big robot fly in, transform, land right here."

1416
01:23:22,626 --> 01:23:27,825
And the guys were in their 20s, 30s, they go, "Would that be Starscream?"

1417
01:23:28,966 --> 01:23:31,400
I'm like...You know, it was...

1418
01:23:32,636 --> 01:23:33,705
I honestly did not think

1419
01:23:33,846 --> 01:23:36,406
there were that many fans around the world for this thing.

1420
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:41,638
And how much it meant to people that are now in their 30s...

1421
01:23:43,689 --> 01:23:47,967
Being told but seeing in your life is a different thing.

1422
01:23:48,235 --> 01:23:54,993
But for Hasbro to say, "This is the largest-selling toy around the world.

1423
01:23:55,367 --> 01:23:59,121
"It's the top-five largest selling toy around the world for 20 years."

1424
01:23:59,371 --> 01:24:00,440
I think that's a big accomplishment.

1425
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:02,173
But I just didn't realize the depth

1426
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:05,609
of how many fans there were around the world.

1427
01:24:05,836 --> 01:24:12,355
And, you know, right now, you just kind of...

1428
01:24:12,927 --> 01:24:14,963
As we were getting ready to release the movie,

1429
01:24:15,137 --> 01:24:18,891
the trailers were always, like, in Yahoo,

1430
01:24:19,141 --> 01:24:23,373
like, the number-one downloaded, most watched, consistently

1431
01:24:23,646 --> 01:24:26,479
from when they came out Christmas till almost the day of the release.

1432
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:29,045
Like, Pirates would come up there, and they would fall back down,

1433
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:31,385
but we were always one and two for the entire time.

1434
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,322
And that kind of told me something.

1435
01:24:33,489 --> 01:24:38,483
It actually became one of the most downloaded trailers in history,

1436
01:24:38,786 --> 01:24:41,220
according to Yahoo that tracks this stuff.

1437
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,452
So all those kind of signs were telling me something.

1438
01:24:45,626 --> 01:24:50,416
And when it opened and it became the largest non-sequel opening of all time,

1439
01:24:50,715 --> 01:24:53,275
I guess I was...

1440
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:58,579
I just honestly did not think it could do as well as it's done so far.

1441
01:24:58,848 --> 01:25:02,238
I mean, it's gonna pass 300-plus million here.

1442
01:25:04,186 --> 01:25:07,940
And it's right up there with the Spider-Man and Pirates 3,

1443
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:10,226
these gigantic franchises.

1444
01:25:11,861 --> 01:25:14,216
And internationally, it's gonna...

1445
01:25:14,405 --> 01:25:16,680
Right now we're already at 260-something,

1446
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:20,063
and it'll probably go to 350, 400, I don't know.

1447
01:25:22,413 --> 01:25:26,201
Anyway, I guess it was a good gamble for the studio on this.

1448
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:28,828
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1449
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:33,792
Got him going down the street.

1450
01:25:34,675 --> 01:25:39,032
A lot of people would've done that helicopter shot right there digitally,

1451
01:25:39,305 --> 01:25:41,421
but not me, for some reason.

1452
01:25:42,058 --> 01:25:45,175
That was a real helicopter very close to that bus.

1453
01:25:45,394 --> 01:25:48,864
I just like things real. As much real as I can get, I'm gonna do.

1454
01:25:50,775 --> 01:25:53,084
It seems to be like a dying art with a lot of directors now

1455
01:25:53,277 --> 01:25:57,156
where you do your own stunts, you do a lot of stunts and stuff like that.

1456
01:25:57,406 --> 01:26:00,079
Doing these gigantic moves on this special Akela crane,

1457
01:26:00,284 --> 01:26:03,879
which is like 75 feet tall, we're able to do these big drops.

1458
01:26:06,415 --> 01:26:07,768
This was kind of a chaotic scene

1459
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:10,715
because we had four helicopters, one airship,

1460
01:26:14,048 --> 01:26:18,997
and it was quite noisy in this river of...

1461
01:26:19,345 --> 01:26:21,381
I don't know if that's...

1462
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:26,269
I don't know what's in that river. That polluted river right there.

1463
01:26:27,436 --> 01:26:30,030
We actually saved a guy's life in the river that night.

1464
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:31,505
We just so happened to be there

1465
01:26:31,649 --> 01:26:34,766
when a guy in a hospital uniform was floating by.

1466
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:36,703
And literally, there's no getting out of that thing

1467
01:26:36,862 --> 01:26:38,853
because that channel travels very quickly.

1468
01:26:39,031 --> 01:26:42,660
And it's all algae, there's no stopping, it goes all the way to the ocean.

1469
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:48,030
One of our electricians just threw out a piece of cable and saved this guy,

1470
01:26:48,332 --> 01:26:51,210
who was like an escapee from some hospital.

1471
01:26:53,921 --> 01:26:56,151
-Take the shot, get him.
-Take the shot.

1472
01:26:57,091 --> 01:26:58,046
No!

1473
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,909
I've never worked on a movie

1474
01:27:01,053 --> 01:27:03,283
where obviously I've had to do so much digital animation,

1475
01:27:03,472 --> 01:27:05,508
character animation.

1476
01:27:05,683 --> 01:27:08,800
It was really one of the most fascinating things about this movie,

1477
01:27:09,019 --> 01:27:11,897
is actually directing these kind of creatures

1478
01:27:12,106 --> 01:27:14,666
and ultimately making them feel

1479
01:27:14,859 --> 01:27:18,374
like you've got a soul inside of them when you see these things.

1480
01:27:18,612 --> 01:27:21,968
And I think it's done through sound and facial stuff.

1481
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:24,918
You just start to feel for this thing that doesn't even exist.

1482
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:28,634
I think that's kind of the accomplishment of the movie.

1483
01:27:37,715 --> 01:27:38,989
Stop hurting him!

1484
01:27:51,854 --> 01:27:55,130
Right there, right there, that's the mock-up of Bumblebee

1485
01:27:55,357 --> 01:27:57,427
we actually built for 200 grand.

1486
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:01,444
Really complicated to build. You couldn't really shoot it that closely.

1487
01:28:01,697 --> 01:28:02,812
Like you're gonna see right there,

1488
01:28:02,948 --> 01:28:06,020
it's the mock-up which saves money on digital shots.

1489
01:28:06,243 --> 01:28:08,552
And then there again you see the mock-up,

1490
01:28:08,746 --> 01:28:11,419
and then we go back to a digital shot.

1491
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,577
So if you use it sparingly, right there,

1492
01:28:14,752 --> 01:28:19,303
the five, six, seven shots with that mock-up just saved a lot of money.

1493
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:22,024
We only had mock-up pieces of like, Optimus Prime,

1494
01:28:22,218 --> 01:28:26,814
and certain head sections but nothing that detailed.

1495
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:31,967
We built Megatron's legs in the chamber where he's being held.

1496
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:36,660
We built about 30 feet of his legs, which cost us half a million dollars,

1497
01:28:36,941 --> 01:28:40,980
but when we use it through those shots it actually saves you on effect shots.

1498
01:28:41,237 --> 01:28:42,670
Because every one of those pieces...

1499
01:28:42,822 --> 01:28:45,780
Reason why it's so expensive, you've got to carve it out of foam,

1500
01:28:45,991 --> 01:28:50,269
and then it's got to be on a steel kind of frame to hold it up.

1501
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,508
This shot right here, I call it "the jungle gym Optimus."

1502
01:28:55,709 --> 01:28:56,903
I just hated the blocking of it,

1503
01:28:57,044 --> 01:29:00,673
but we were just kind of stuck with the shot that we had shot.

1504
01:29:00,923 --> 01:29:01,992
Often times the animators

1505
01:29:02,133 --> 01:29:03,725
had to squeeze in where we could fit our robots.

1506
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:08,582
We got to be very good at shooting robots after a while.

1507
01:29:08,764 --> 01:29:10,720
We used a special tool.

1508
01:29:12,268 --> 01:29:16,341
It's a Porsche Cayenne with a special crane on it where we were able

1509
01:29:18,691 --> 01:29:20,886
to move at a high rate of speed on a car

1510
01:29:21,068 --> 01:29:22,387
and we can do these amazing crane moves.

1511
01:29:22,528 --> 01:29:27,556
It was actually a robot-cam where we could spin around.

1512
01:29:27,867 --> 01:29:29,823
Right there walking through National Military Command,

1513
01:29:29,994 --> 01:29:31,188
that was a room that I'd been to,

1514
01:29:31,328 --> 01:29:34,286
it's in the basement of the Pentagon, that's where they run wars and whatnot.

1515
01:29:34,498 --> 01:29:38,173
And the thing that I always remember was going down there,

1516
01:29:38,419 --> 01:29:40,216
they have these two Lucite doors

1517
01:29:40,379 --> 01:29:45,453
that are like bullet-proof and blast-proof and you have to go through these doors.

1518
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:53,651
The chamber that we take this conversation that comes up

1519
01:29:53,976 --> 01:29:57,605
is called the Vault in the Pentagon, actually.

1520
01:29:57,855 --> 01:30:00,653
It's this soundproof room that has this vault door

1521
01:30:00,858 --> 01:30:03,213
and it has five seats

1522
01:30:04,695 --> 01:30:09,894
for the Secretary of Defense and the four different branches of military,

1523
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:12,351
with a direct link to the President.

1524
01:30:12,536 --> 01:30:14,845
They feel that this room is like,

1525
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:17,269
the fewer people that know about what's going on,

1526
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:19,608
the better a secret could be kept.

1527
01:30:19,794 --> 01:30:23,230
We kind of designed it exactly the way I saw the room

1528
01:30:23,464 --> 01:30:27,503
from my memory, I guess, when I was down at the Pentagon.

1529
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,875
They actually took me into the room

1530
01:30:29,011 --> 01:30:31,127
where the two guys are there to launch nuclear weapons.

1531
01:30:31,305 --> 01:30:35,423
They sit in their own vault. It was kind of an odd experience.

1532
01:30:35,684 --> 01:30:36,719
I was down at the Pentagon

1533
01:30:36,852 --> 01:30:40,527
when I was doing Pearl Harbor, the tap dance.

1534
01:30:42,191 --> 01:30:46,901
I met with every branch of the military because of the cooperation we needed.

1535
01:30:48,989 --> 01:30:53,221
Actually, Transformers, since Black Hawk Down and Pearl Harbor...

1536
01:30:53,494 --> 01:30:55,644
This has been the largest military cooperation

1537
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:58,628
that they've done thus far since those two movies.

1538
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:02,477
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1539
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,673
This was classified above top secret.

1540
01:31:09,093 --> 01:31:10,287
This is actually the very first stuff

1541
01:31:10,428 --> 01:31:14,057
we ever shot for Transformers right here, the Mars rover here.

1542
01:31:14,306 --> 01:31:15,864
It was part of our teaser.

1543
01:31:16,016 --> 01:31:17,165
I've always been fascinated,

1544
01:31:17,309 --> 01:31:21,621
what if the Mars rover found something that was of human origin?

1545
01:31:21,897 --> 01:31:24,411
So it's something I always saved for a movie.

1546
01:31:27,292 --> 01:31:29,385
This is the image from Mars.

1547
01:31:30,228 --> 01:31:34,860
Here's the image your Special Ops team was able to retrieve from the base attack.

1548
01:31:35,633 --> 01:31:38,727
We believe they are of the same exoskeletal type,

1549
01:31:39,604 --> 01:31:42,368
and obviously not Russian or North Korean.

1550
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:45,436
Are we talking about an invasion?

1551
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:48,637
We intercepted the message from your Special Ops team.

1552
01:31:48,746 --> 01:31:52,079
These things can be hurt by our weapons and now they know it.

1553
01:31:52,183 --> 01:31:53,912
That's why the virus shut us down,

1554
01:31:54,018 --> 01:31:57,317
so we can't coordinate against their next attack,

1555
01:31:57,422 --> 01:32:01,916
which I would bet my ridiculous government salary is coming soon.

1556
01:32:05,797 --> 01:32:08,129
Get word to our fleet commanders over the National Guard frequency.

1557
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:11,633
It's a shortwave radio channel. It might be still working.

1558
01:32:11,736 --> 01:32:15,069
Tell them to turn their ships around and come home. ASAP!

1559
01:32:15,173 --> 01:32:18,142
And inform all commands to prepare for imminent attack.

1560
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:24,691
Josh Duhamel is someone I met

1561
01:32:24,877 --> 01:32:27,755
in one of my Platinum Dunes meetings, for a movie,

1562
01:32:28,005 --> 01:32:31,680
and I just liked his energy. He just was a great guy.

1563
01:32:31,926 --> 01:32:34,520
And he's got those movie star looks.

1564
01:32:37,556 --> 01:32:39,786
Just thought he would be a good fit in this movie.

1565
01:32:39,975 --> 01:32:43,968
Jon Voight's one of the elder statesmen. He's just...

1566
01:32:44,397 --> 01:32:46,831
Actors love hanging around him. He's a really fun guy.

1567
01:32:47,024 --> 01:32:49,663
He's just such a good actor.

1568
01:32:52,196 --> 01:32:56,109
And it was nice to see all these young actors around him.

1569
01:32:57,993 --> 01:33:00,871
He's really such a leader among these actors.

1570
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:05,596
Steven wanted me to cast this movie where I wasn't using movie stars,

1571
01:33:05,876 --> 01:33:08,470
like he would do a lot of his movies.

1572
01:33:08,671 --> 01:33:10,787
Because, you know, the movie was the star.

1573
01:33:10,965 --> 01:33:14,082
The Transformers were the star.

1574
01:33:14,301 --> 01:33:16,895
I think right now you've got this Shia LaBeouf,

1575
01:33:17,096 --> 01:33:19,326
who's just gonna explode off the screen.

1576
01:33:19,515 --> 01:33:23,030
He's now in Indiana Jones.

1577
01:33:24,061 --> 01:33:28,657
The guy is, you know, he's like the young Tom Hanks.

1578
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:36,320
He's just one of those kids that really has exploded off the screen.

1579
01:33:36,615 --> 01:33:39,049
I'm proud to have worked with him.

1580
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:44,366
He's been a lot of fun to work with, actually. Great energy.

1581
01:33:44,462 --> 01:33:47,192
Please, let this work.

1582
01:33:48,599 --> 01:33:50,499
Fire it up, Optimus.

1583
01:33:51,469 --> 01:33:52,959
The code.

1584
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:58,474
The code on these glasses indicates the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1585
01:34:00,295 --> 01:34:04,095
I sense the Decepticons are getting ready to mobilize.

1586
01:34:05,266 --> 01:34:07,029
They must know it's here, as well.

1587
01:34:07,135 --> 01:34:08,466
What about Bumblebee?

1588
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:12,631
We can't just leave him to die and become some human experiment!

1589
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:16,733
He'll die in vain if we don't accomplish our mission.

1590
01:34:16,845 --> 01:34:21,077
Bumblebee is a brave soldier. This is what he would want.

1591
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:26,469
This is the Los Angeles Observatory,

1592
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:30,784
and it's been under renovation for five years.

1593
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:37,089
And California becomes a very tough place to shoot,

1594
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:40,775
where they just make it tough to shoot.

1595
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:42,078
And that's been closed...

1596
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:45,256
And when you have a big movie, you have a lot more clout.

1597
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:50,121
So going to City Hall and convincing them

1598
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,910
that we're bringing this gigantic movie here,

1599
01:34:52,062 --> 01:34:55,737
and we're keeping it here in America and in California

1600
01:34:55,983 --> 01:34:58,816
where things are running away, moving out of state.

1601
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:03,983
And we demanded certain things, like to shoot at this observatory.

1602
01:35:05,117 --> 01:35:08,075
I think the only way I got into this observatory, from what I heard,

1603
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:09,959
because it's run by this doctor,

1604
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:14,115
he knows someone who is married into my family

1605
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:16,571
called Leonard Nimoy. You know, Spock,

1606
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:18,311
who's a big giver of the...

1607
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:22,012
Susan Bay and Leonard Nimoy are big givers to the Observatory.

1608
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:25,459
Right here this is the Hoover Dam.

1609
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:28,071
And that's its actual wall.

1610
01:35:28,265 --> 01:35:31,814
They don't touch it because it's kind of a landmark, obviously,

1611
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,574
and they don't put rails around it and whatnot.

1612
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:37,444
They told me I wasn't allowed to do anything that exploded by it,

1613
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:40,163
because they're worried about a terrorist blowing up the dam.

1614
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,713
Now, let me tell you something.

1615
01:35:41,862 --> 01:35:44,615
I think you need a nuclear bomb to blow that thing up

1616
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:48,702
because it's seven football fields thick of concrete.

1617
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:50,101
It was made in three years.

1618
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:54,124
It was a constant pour. Actually it was made in four...I think, four years.

1619
01:35:56,585 --> 01:35:58,257
A constant pour,

1620
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:01,696
where they poured one piece of concrete for four years.

1621
01:36:01,924 --> 01:36:02,959
When I did this movie,

1622
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,843
I mean, certain people in California look at this movie,

1623
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,762
like, "Is this director stupid?

1624
01:36:06,929 --> 01:36:09,841
"Because they go from Nevada all the way to Los Angeles.

1625
01:36:10,057 --> 01:36:12,093
"How did they go so fast?"

1626
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:15,464
Ultimately, most people don't know where this dam is,

1627
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,518
which is in Nevada.

1628
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:23,187
Half of it's in Nevada, half is in Arizona, by the way.

1629
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:26,278
And I tried to shoot Los Angeles not as Los Angeles

1630
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,401
but Anytown, USA.

1631
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:35,465
That shot you just saw there, that crane shot by the dam,

1632
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:39,450
we had to keep our crane very low because of possible arcing,

1633
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:43,549
where it would arc from the gigantic power lines onto the crane,

1634
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:46,916
just because of metals too close to these power lines

1635
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,933
that could jump and kill my crew members.

1636
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:53,282
It's very scary, I must say.

1637
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,710
This was shot down at the Spruce Goose,

1638
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:00,570
where we built this entire set. We did some digital extensions here.

1639
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:05,442
We used some of the actual Spruce Goose walls.

1640
01:37:05,696 --> 01:37:07,652
It just gave me a lot more production value.

1641
01:37:07,823 --> 01:37:10,291
Right there, you're seeing that's all real,

1642
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:13,131
everything there is built, those feet are real.

1643
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,374
It even says "Bay Foundry" right there on that little plaque

1644
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:19,335
right there if you zoom in.

1645
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:24,598
My grandfather actually helped build that platform...No, I'm kidding.

1646
01:37:26,133 --> 01:37:29,648
My grandfather was in the stonewashing business.

1647
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:32,025
Like you need to know that.

1648
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,535
He actually never thought I would make it in the film industry.

1649
01:37:34,725 --> 01:37:36,556
He always thought I would be stonewashing jeans.

1650
01:37:36,727 --> 01:37:38,638
Thank God I wasn't doing that.

1651
01:37:38,912 --> 01:37:42,413
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1652
01:37:42,984 --> 01:37:45,612
And you didn't think the United States military might need to know

1653
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,086
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement?

1654
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:52,182
Until these events, we had no credible threat to national security.

1655
01:37:52,293 --> 01:37:54,158
Well, you got one now.

1656
01:37:55,096 --> 01:37:56,113
- So why Earth?

1657
01:37:56,413 --> 01:37:59,291
Right here, that was a real structure as well.

1658
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:01,569
We built part of the hands.

1659
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:15,990
We walk into this next scene.

1660
01:38:16,183 --> 01:38:18,094
I had a very funny speech for John Turturro.

1661
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:22,227
He actually...John kind of sparked off something I said,

1662
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:23,834
and he made up this very funny speech

1663
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:28,055
which is in kind of the added extras, extra scenes.

1664
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:41,879
Right here, that was an all-digital shot.

1665
01:38:43,502 --> 01:38:46,175
For some reason, I just wanted pictures of the First Seven.

1666
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,415
I don't know what it means.

1667
01:38:47,548 --> 01:38:50,620
I think these are the guys that helped discover this Cube long before,

1668
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,117
and then they built the dam over this Cube.

1669
01:38:53,354 --> 01:38:55,914
President Hoover had the dam built around it.

1670
01:38:56,023 --> 01:38:58,389
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1671
01:38:58,493 --> 01:39:01,826
A perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone

1672
01:39:01,929 --> 01:39:05,524
or any alien species on the outside.

1673
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:19,254
So when we had to shoot by the F-22 on the ground,

1674
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:22,685
it was a totally secured area.

1675
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:24,634
And they wouldn't allow Simon Warnock,

1676
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:27,626
who was my assistant director, near the plane because he was a foreigner.

1677
01:39:27,838 --> 01:39:30,477
And I didn't want him near the plane because he's clumsy.

1678
01:39:30,674 --> 01:39:35,907
It's $1 30 million plane made out of composite material and whatnot.

1679
01:39:36,597 --> 01:39:38,155
They wouldn't allow your cell phones near the plane.

1680
01:39:38,307 --> 01:39:42,186
I think they were worried about radio interference or something,

1681
01:39:42,436 --> 01:39:43,835
I'm not sure.

1682
01:39:43,979 --> 01:39:45,697
That Blackout pilot was

1683
01:39:45,856 --> 01:39:49,007
actually the helicopter pilot of that very helicopter,

1684
01:39:49,234 --> 01:39:51,509
and when we hired Moustache Man,

1685
01:39:52,029 --> 01:39:54,748
the guy actually flying,

1686
01:39:54,948 --> 01:39:57,667
I said, "My God, you look just like the Moustache Man I'd imagined."

1687
01:39:57,868 --> 01:39:59,142
And Steven Spielberg called me up

1688
01:39:59,286 --> 01:40:01,595
and goes, "That's exactly how I pictured Moustache Man."

1689
01:40:01,788 --> 01:40:06,020
So, we actually had him delay his wedding and his honeymoon

1690
01:40:06,293 --> 01:40:08,853
so that we can come and shoot Transformers

1691
01:40:09,046 --> 01:40:12,402
and thus make more money for his future babies.

1692
01:40:12,633 --> 01:40:14,544
So we helped in the cause.

1693
01:40:14,812 --> 01:40:17,370
- Right? That's Wolverine! - That's very funny.

1694
01:40:18,906 --> 01:40:21,932
Anybody have any mechanical devices? BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1695
01:40:22,043 --> 01:40:23,476
I got a phone.

1696
01:40:23,977 --> 01:40:27,367
Originally when we did this scene, I really wanted to have a little iPod,

1697
01:40:27,606 --> 01:40:30,518
but Steve Jobs wouldn't allow it.

1698
01:40:30,734 --> 01:40:34,522
So we ended up using some, I guess, Nokia phone or whatnot.

1699
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:37,135
On that sign behind John Turturro

1700
01:40:37,324 --> 01:40:41,317
it says, "The last accident happened here 322 days ago,"

1701
01:40:41,578 --> 01:40:47,050
because that meant that 323 days ago someone was killed in that very facility,

1702
01:40:47,376 --> 01:40:49,685
as you saw the scratches in the wall and whatnot.

1703
01:40:49,878 --> 01:40:53,075
I actually ended up cutting it out just for time.

1704
01:41:01,807 --> 01:41:03,320
I think when we do Transformers 2,

1705
01:41:03,475 --> 01:41:06,672
I think this is a start of something where we can branch off

1706
01:41:06,895 --> 01:41:09,489
what can really go on, happen in our world.

1707
01:41:11,358 --> 01:41:15,317
That is, if I'm gonna do Transformers 2, still haven't made the deal yet.

1708
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:18,418
Listen, I gambled my fee on this movie.

1709
01:41:18,574 --> 01:41:20,849
That means I put my cojones on the line

1710
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:24,993
where I gambled my entire fee that this movie would make money.

1711
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:30,134
So that's why when I go to Vegas with my friends I don't gamble.

1712
01:41:30,335 --> 01:41:31,893
'Cause I gamble on $1 50 million movies.

1713
01:41:32,045 --> 01:41:34,081
I don't need to be gambling on $20 slot machines

1714
01:41:34,256 --> 01:41:37,054
or, you know, $5 hands of blackjack.

1715
01:41:37,259 --> 01:41:40,217
I gamble on big-ass movies, that's what I do.

1716
01:41:52,266 --> 01:41:54,894
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1717
01:41:55,670 --> 01:41:57,001
Banachek. What's going on?

1718
01:41:57,104 --> 01:41:58,935
Well, the NBE One hangar has lost power...

1719
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,098
<i>- What? - ... and the backup generator</i>

1720
01:42:00,207 --> 01:42:02,175
<i>- is just not gonna cut it. - Do you have an arms room?</i>

1721
01:42:02,868 --> 01:42:04,586
That was Kenny Bates and Ian Bryce.

1722
01:42:04,745 --> 01:42:08,624
Kenny Bates is my stunt coordinator, who I've worked with since Bad Boys.

1723
01:42:10,626 --> 01:42:12,742
He's like my older brother.

1724
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:19,923
He's like the Rain Man of stunts.

1725
01:42:20,135 --> 01:42:22,854
Sometimes you can't understand what he's saying,

1726
01:42:23,055 --> 01:42:24,807
but he's brilliant in his physics and whatnot.

1727
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:29,444
He's gonna kill me for saying that, but that's the truth.

1728
01:42:32,522 --> 01:42:35,116
There's so much physics when you do stunts

1729
01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:39,196
in what can go wrong and trying to predict what can go wrong.

1730
01:42:39,446 --> 01:42:43,325
That's why we've had such an amazing safety record together.

1731
01:42:43,575 --> 01:42:45,372
Because we do very dangerous stuff,

1732
01:42:45,536 --> 01:42:49,529
but we've just been incredibly safe about it.

1733
01:42:49,812 --> 01:42:52,053
Forty millimeter sabot rounds on that table!

1734
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:56,152
That's good. Get all the ammo you got. Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1735
01:43:01,702 --> 01:43:04,330
You got to take me to my car. You have to take me to my car.

1736
01:43:04,438 --> 01:43:05,462
He's gonna know what to do with the Cube.

1737
01:43:05,573 --> 01:43:07,507
- Your car? It's confiscated. - Then unconfiscate it.

1738
01:43:07,608 --> 01:43:09,337
We do not know what will happen if we let it near this thing!

1739
01:43:09,443 --> 01:43:10,705
- You don't know. - Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1740
01:43:10,811 --> 01:43:12,176
You just wanna sit here and wait and see what happens?

1741
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:14,270
I have people's lives at stake here, young man.

1742
01:43:14,382 --> 01:43:16,111
Take him to his car!

1743
01:43:17,852 --> 01:43:19,046
Drop it.

1744
01:43:20,821 --> 01:43:22,482
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1745
01:43:23,758 --> 01:43:25,749
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1746
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:27,989
There's an alien war going on and you're gonna shoot me?

1747
01:43:28,095 --> 01:43:29,119
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1748
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:31,425
I'm ordering you under S-Seven executive jurisdiction.

1749
01:43:31,532 --> 01:43:32,692
S-Seven don't exist.

1750
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,563
Right. And we don't take orders from people that don't exist.

1751
01:43:34,668 --> 01:43:37,933
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay. - Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1752
01:43:40,541 --> 01:43:42,168
- Simmons? - Yes, sir?

1753
01:43:42,276 --> 01:43:46,337
I'd do what he says. Losing's really not an option for these guys.

1754
01:43:50,851 --> 01:43:52,819
All right. Okay.

1755
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:57,550
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1756
01:44:00,995 --> 01:44:02,257
No, no!

1757
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:05,892
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1758
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,561
No, no, stop, stop, stop! Let him go! Let him go!

1759
01:44:10,771 --> 01:44:12,170
Are you okay?

1760
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:16,134
They didn't hurt you, right?

1761
01:44:24,885 --> 01:44:28,685
Listen to me. The Cube is here and the Decepticons are coming.

1762
01:44:31,092 --> 01:44:33,185
No, no, don't worry about them. They're okay. Right?

1763
01:44:33,294 --> 01:44:35,524
They're not gonna hurt you.

1764
01:44:35,629 --> 01:44:39,156
Just back up a little bit. He's friendly. He's fine.

1765
01:44:39,266 --> 01:44:42,531
Okay, come on. Put the guns down. They're not gonna hurt you.

1766
01:44:42,636 --> 01:44:44,126
Here, come with me. I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1767
01:44:46,281 --> 01:44:50,513
Steve Jablonsky did our music. He is Hans Zimmer's protege.

1768
01:44:50,786 --> 01:44:52,458
Hans helped a little on the movie, as well.

1769
01:44:52,663 --> 01:44:55,052
It was very hard to get that theme,

1770
01:44:55,249 --> 01:44:57,479
that heroic theme I wanted for Transformers.

1771
01:44:57,668 --> 01:45:00,580
And just one day, I said, "Steve, that's the theme."

1772
01:45:00,796 --> 01:45:03,390
I played it for Steven and Steven goes, "I love that, it's very memorable."

1773
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:09,586
Because it sounds like a Western. It's just got that great tragic hero.

1774
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:15,163
Which I liked. It's just so powerful how to get the right mood

1775
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:17,627
through music.

1776
01:45:19,731 --> 01:45:24,088
That's why I really feel that sound in movies is 50% of a movie.

1777
01:45:24,361 --> 01:45:27,592
What you try to do with music is you try to set up different themes.

1778
01:45:27,823 --> 01:45:29,381
You've got the heroic theme for the Optimus.

1779
01:45:29,533 --> 01:45:34,527
You've got Sam's theme which is kind of by the lake.

1780
01:45:35,914 --> 01:45:42,353
You've got the Decepticon theme which is kind of, we found this...

1781
01:45:42,713 --> 01:45:45,785
There's this church choir in London

1782
01:45:46,008 --> 01:45:51,640
that's got this very dark-sounding church they record in,

1783
01:45:51,972 --> 01:45:57,126
and we gave them operatic kind of words that they sang.

1784
01:45:57,436 --> 01:46:01,111
And it was just this chilling kind of Decepticon music.

1785
01:46:01,412 --> 01:46:02,405
- Will it work? - Anything's possible!

1786
01:46:02,516 --> 01:46:04,950
- Did you see that... - All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1787
01:46:05,052 --> 01:46:06,815
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1788
01:46:07,112 --> 01:46:08,288
You saw that Camaro transform right there.

1789
01:46:08,447 --> 01:46:12,440
That was officially the lamest shot of the entire movie.

1790
01:46:12,701 --> 01:46:17,138
That's why we cut it down. You always have turkey shots.

1791
01:46:17,414 --> 01:46:18,642
And that was, let me tell you, a turkey.

1792
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:21,179
I'm gonna tell you another shot when we get there.

1793
01:46:22,002 --> 01:46:24,596
Steven actually wanted to pay for it.

1794
01:46:24,796 --> 01:46:28,232
It's where Optimus' nose unfolds and you see his face

1795
01:46:28,467 --> 01:46:32,380
after he slides around the Camaro. I never ended up putting it in the movie.

1796
01:46:32,638 --> 01:46:34,151
I left it off.

1797
01:46:43,398 --> 01:46:46,674
I am Megatron!

1798
01:46:53,325 --> 01:46:57,238
Right here, that thing flying, I didn't like that thing flying.

1799
01:46:57,496 --> 01:47:00,533
That flew a little farther than I wanted for comfort.

1800
01:47:00,749 --> 01:47:04,788
We had stuntmen down below, but no one was hurt.

1801
01:47:05,112 --> 01:47:06,511
- The Cube's okay? - Yeah, it's fine.

1802
01:47:06,614 --> 01:47:07,603
Well, put the seat belt on.

1803
01:47:18,684 --> 01:47:22,199
That one sound when you see Starscream on the top of that dam,

1804
01:47:22,437 --> 01:47:25,110
and he's vibrating, that's my favorite sound in the entire movie.

1805
01:47:25,315 --> 01:47:28,944
When you hear his body shudder, right there.

1806
01:47:29,194 --> 01:47:34,666
What I'm gonna do in Transformers 2 is I'm gonna focus more on the faces.

1807
01:47:34,992 --> 01:47:38,462
I guess, because of the limited number of effects shots, I limited myself

1808
01:47:38,704 --> 01:47:40,934
on how close I went into these faces

1809
01:47:41,123 --> 01:47:43,717
so that I can, I guess, do more with less.

1810
01:47:43,912 --> 01:47:45,443
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1811
01:47:45,552 --> 01:47:47,986
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me. Plugged in there.

1812
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:53,348
- We're hot! We're live! - Where are the mikes?

1813
01:47:54,395 --> 01:47:55,384
Mikes?

1814
01:47:55,496 --> 01:47:56,758
This doesn't work without mikes, Simmons.

1815
01:47:56,864 --> 01:47:58,422
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1816
01:47:59,057 --> 01:48:03,209
This is called our Alien Archive room, that I thought was fun.

1817
01:48:03,478 --> 01:48:08,757
It's got books going 40 feet tall up into the stacks.

1818
01:48:09,067 --> 01:48:13,538
This holds all the Sector Seven stuff that's been there through history

1819
01:48:13,822 --> 01:48:17,576
of anything alien, having to do with our world here.

1820
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:21,288
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1821
01:48:33,175 --> 01:48:34,051
There's Optimus.

1822
01:48:36,011 --> 01:48:38,571
That shot where we're tracking behind Optimus,

1823
01:48:38,764 --> 01:48:41,483
I'm actually in the Porsche Cayenne. We're going 55 miles an hour,

1824
01:48:41,683 --> 01:48:45,153
as an entire semi locks up, and we are right behind.

1825
01:48:45,395 --> 01:48:48,307
I mean, I gotta tell you, that's a little scary.

1826
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:53,028
We shot that scene where they're driving in the Valley of Fire.

1827
01:48:53,278 --> 01:48:56,350
We actually blew a roadblock because the sun was going down.

1828
01:48:56,573 --> 01:49:00,282
Which means we passed a cop roadblock, and we kept shooting

1829
01:49:00,536 --> 01:49:03,972
on this road, and they were so pissed.

1830
01:49:04,206 --> 01:49:08,518
They hauled Ian Bryce, my producer, and he had to kiss a bunch of hands

1831
01:49:08,794 --> 01:49:13,504
in Vegas or they were gonna shut us down at the Hoover Dam.

1832
01:49:13,799 --> 01:49:16,154
So thank God to Ian, but I had to get this shot. And you know what?

1833
01:49:16,343 --> 01:49:19,176
I'll run any police roadblock I have to if the sun's going down,

1834
01:49:19,388 --> 01:49:20,821
and I got a beautiful shot.

1835
01:49:20,973 --> 01:49:24,488
See, I'm never really good at taking no for an answer.

1836
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:30,274
I don't know, "Whoops, I didn't see it, sorry."

1837
01:49:30,512 --> 01:49:33,683
"This is Defense Secretary Keller. Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1838
01:49:33,794 --> 01:49:35,318
- Whoa! - Whoa!

1839
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:38,054
What was that?

1840
01:49:38,165 --> 01:49:40,998
Authenticate emergency action. Blackbird 1195...

1841
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:45,365
Sir, I have an authenticated air strike order from Sec Def.

1842
01:49:47,541 --> 01:49:54,253
Doing this highway scene, we shot it on a freeway, near Riverside.

1843
01:49:56,341 --> 01:50:00,175
I've done a lot of car stuff in my day. We did this in two days.

1844
01:50:00,429 --> 01:50:04,502
We're actually launching cars off a car carrier that are dropping

1845
01:50:04,766 --> 01:50:08,759
onto the ground and the Bay Buster is actually ramming into these cars.

1846
01:50:09,021 --> 01:50:11,330
It's a special thing that I built on Bad Boys 2. Go see that disc,

1847
01:50:11,523 --> 01:50:12,638
and then you'll learn all about it.

1848
01:50:12,816 --> 01:50:15,046
So on this freeway, you can see all those people standing up there?

1849
01:50:15,235 --> 01:50:17,032
They heard that Transformers was shooting

1850
01:50:17,195 --> 01:50:22,110
in the neighborhood. So those are real fans actually watching us shoot.

1851
01:50:22,409 --> 01:50:25,924
Right here, this is done with a special go-cart and then we transition

1852
01:50:26,163 --> 01:50:31,396
to the Porsche Cayenne camera and we tilt down and we pull away.

1853
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:36,909
Two different moves and we seamlessly blend it in together.

1854
01:50:37,216 --> 01:50:40,014
So I wanted Bonecrusher, right here, as he slaps through,

1855
01:50:40,219 --> 01:50:44,417
I wanted him to look like a hockey player. So I had the...

1856
01:50:44,681 --> 01:50:46,080
Right here, this looks like a hockey player

1857
01:50:46,225 --> 01:50:48,181
and then we go to a football tackle, right there.

1858
01:50:48,352 --> 01:50:51,230
That was my favorite shot in the whole movie, right there.

1859
01:50:51,438 --> 01:50:55,397
This was over a freeway and we had the bigger moving crane.

1860
01:50:55,651 --> 01:51:00,042
We blocked this doing plates and whatnot.

1861
01:51:00,322 --> 01:51:06,033
What I realized in the animation is the animators are not fight choreographers.

1862
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:09,407
Fight choreographers have been working 20 years and been doing this.

1863
01:51:09,623 --> 01:51:13,218
So they spent forever on this stuff right here, you're seeing right now,

1864
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:15,416
and they were never getting it right.

1865
01:51:15,587 --> 01:51:19,262
So what we did is, once I got these plates, these shots,

1866
01:51:19,591 --> 01:51:23,027
I actually used real fighters that had different abilities,

1867
01:51:23,262 --> 01:51:24,695
different fighting skills,

1868
01:51:24,846 --> 01:51:28,156
and I would videotape them by a pole or whatnot,

1869
01:51:28,392 --> 01:51:31,270
and kind of imitate these angles. And we actually had humans

1870
01:51:31,478 --> 01:51:36,347
fighting this out at the same beat, at the same time as these plates.

1871
01:51:36,650 --> 01:51:40,563
And it wasn't motion-capture, but they were able to copy

1872
01:51:40,821 --> 01:51:43,779
what these fighters were doing in the time they were doing it.

1873
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:47,666
So that became a very effective way for us to work.

1874
01:51:51,373 --> 01:51:54,092
The voice of this little Frenzy guy,

1875
01:51:54,293 --> 01:51:56,648
he's just got the most amazing human voice,

1876
01:51:56,837 --> 01:52:00,193
and we were able to overlay some mechanical sounds over it.

1877
01:52:00,424 --> 01:52:02,415
It's amazing that humans can actually talk like this.

1878
01:52:02,593 --> 01:52:03,821
But it makes it quite funny.

1879
01:52:03,969 --> 01:52:07,439
If you listen really closely, he's saying the word "Tutankhamen."

1880
01:52:07,681 --> 01:52:09,114
He keeps saying "Tutankhamen,"

1881
01:52:09,266 --> 01:52:12,941
I don't know, it's just a funny thing, if you listen to it.

1882
01:52:14,288 --> 01:52:16,256
Sucker, burn!

1883
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:23,360
Oh, shit!

1884
01:52:23,697 --> 01:52:25,722
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1885
01:52:30,621 --> 01:52:32,657
Here we are at Edwards Air Force Base,

1886
01:52:32,915 --> 01:52:35,145
where they're actually going into real F-22s,

1887
01:52:35,334 --> 01:52:38,371
unlike Die Hard, where they had to use fake F-22s,

1888
01:52:38,587 --> 01:52:40,543
because, I don't know, they just don't have the juice.

1889
01:52:40,714 --> 01:52:42,989
But we got real stuff.

1890
01:52:43,175 --> 01:52:46,611
That's because I got the phone number to the Pentagon.

1891
01:52:46,887 --> 01:52:50,448
- Come on, let's go! Mount up! - Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1892
01:52:50,557 --> 01:52:52,752
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1893
01:52:53,293 --> 01:52:55,488
Wait. What am I supposed to do with these?

1894
01:52:55,596 --> 01:52:57,894
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1895
01:52:58,298 --> 01:53:01,290
This is like Radio Shack dinosaur radios or something, man.

1896
01:53:02,236 --> 01:53:04,272
Doing this downtown stuff, I gotta tell you,

1897
01:53:04,446 --> 01:53:06,277
is one of the harder things that I've done

1898
01:53:06,448 --> 01:53:10,407
in terms of keeping all these different storylines going simultaneously.

1899
01:53:10,661 --> 01:53:13,778
And unfortunately, what made it harder for me is I was not able to shoot

1900
01:53:13,997 --> 01:53:18,548
on one block consecutively. I literally had to be shoved around LA

1901
01:53:18,835 --> 01:53:23,590
to different blocks, and so I had to use basically three different blocks.

1902
01:53:23,882 --> 01:53:29,673
One in Detroit, two in LA...Actually four. One on the Universal back lot.

1903
01:53:30,013 --> 01:53:34,848
And blend them all together as if they're one.

1904
01:53:35,143 --> 01:53:38,499
So some of the geography shots, I don't really have,

1905
01:53:38,730 --> 01:53:43,087
because I was never able to do it. Because they were different blocks,

1906
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:46,909
and it would give things away. So it made it very tough on me

1907
01:53:47,155 --> 01:53:51,512
to figure out some of the stuff. But one of the helps was

1908
01:53:51,785 --> 01:53:55,255
we had to shoot on the weekends, so I was able to assemble

1909
01:53:55,497 --> 01:53:59,126
what we were shooting, so I can keep track of everything.

1910
01:53:59,835 --> 01:54:02,030
You know, it's just...

1911
01:54:02,212 --> 01:54:07,047
It's really hard when you've got multiple stories going on.

1912
01:54:10,846 --> 01:54:14,316
Especially this is like a 25-minute ending action scene.

1913
01:54:17,603 --> 01:54:19,594
This is one of my favorite moments, here.

1914
01:54:19,771 --> 01:54:22,365
This was shot on the Universal back lot, this shot.

1915
01:54:22,566 --> 01:54:25,956
With a real truck, we moved it on cue.

1916
01:54:26,194 --> 01:54:29,311
Right there, we kind of shake it because I'm counting it out.

1917
01:54:29,531 --> 01:54:34,207
We kind of walk it out for Shia, how fast Bumblebee will be moving.

1918
01:54:35,954 --> 01:54:38,832
It's just beautiful animation right here, and how he's straining, right there.

1919
01:54:39,041 --> 01:54:42,192
See that arm going down and the head shaking, right here.

1920
01:54:44,296 --> 01:54:47,368
You can really get into the fine detail with these animators.

1921
01:54:47,591 --> 01:54:51,266
That was Universal back lot, right here and then the shot with Josh

1922
01:54:51,511 --> 01:54:54,423
in the close up, that was downtown. So it's just...

1923
01:54:56,350 --> 01:55:00,548
You gotta remember exactly what piece you shot that you need in another place.

1924
01:55:00,812 --> 01:55:02,514
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound to your location. Over.</i>

1925
01:55:04,291 --> 01:55:06,418
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1926
01:55:06,526 --> 01:55:08,858
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1927
01:55:12,115 --> 01:55:14,948
That's the Universal back lot, right there.

1928
01:55:16,245 --> 01:55:18,475
And again, Universal back lot.

1929
01:55:20,123 --> 01:55:22,557
DreamWorks kept having meetings on the Universal back lot,

1930
01:55:22,751 --> 01:55:27,063
they kept hearing explosions. Now we come down to downtown.

1931
01:55:27,339 --> 01:55:30,775
And now we're in the back lot. See how you can go back and forth.

1932
01:55:31,009 --> 01:55:35,127
You really can't tell. That's the back lot, and now we're downtown.

1933
01:55:43,438 --> 01:55:44,632
I'm not gonna leave you.

1934
01:55:57,953 --> 01:56:01,229
Coming up here, these are some of my favorite shots, right here.

1935
01:56:01,456 --> 01:56:05,654
This just takes it to a whole new level. I wanted these robots not to be,

1936
01:56:05,919 --> 01:56:10,788
what I call "Clunky, fat, f-ing robots."

1937
01:56:11,091 --> 01:56:14,766
That was the lingo on the animator's desk.

1938
01:56:15,012 --> 01:56:19,642
So we looked at a lot of ninja movies, karate movies, samurai,

1939
01:56:19,933 --> 01:56:22,493
things like Gladiator.

1940
01:56:22,686 --> 01:56:26,361
We just wanted them to be warriors that can jump and spin.

1941
01:56:33,238 --> 01:56:36,753
If you look at this scene, right here, coming up, where he's shooting,

1942
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:41,304
there's gonna be something right here on the roof, right there,

1943
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:42,979
it says "Takara Sushi."

1944
01:56:43,123 --> 01:56:45,557
There's actually a whole bunch of things.

1945
01:56:45,751 --> 01:56:49,380
If you actually pause at certain cars, random cars, you'll see things

1946
01:56:49,630 --> 01:56:53,623
on license plates. You'll see Easter eggs all over this movie.

1947
01:56:57,387 --> 01:57:00,902
You'll see different shop signs that say certain things.

1948
01:57:02,351 --> 01:57:04,865
You'll even see my address to my house on one of these things.

1949
01:57:05,062 --> 01:57:07,292
I'm not telling you where it is.

1950
01:57:07,481 --> 01:57:10,632
Got the tail number to my plane, it's 4500 XRAY.

1951
01:57:13,153 --> 01:57:16,941
We needed a tail number, so why not use mine? Sounds good, too.

1952
01:57:17,424 --> 01:57:19,016
Fall back!

1953
01:57:25,031 --> 01:57:27,226
Get our guys out of the way! Get out of here! Go!

1954
01:57:27,334 --> 01:57:29,359
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1955
01:57:29,469 --> 01:57:31,733
We need air cover down here now!

1956
01:57:37,744 --> 01:57:39,143
Sam, help me with this.

1957
01:57:43,316 --> 01:57:47,650
- That all you got, Megatron? - Come here, little cretin.

1958
01:57:47,754 --> 01:57:49,847
You want a piece of me? You want a piece?

1959
01:57:49,956 --> 01:57:52,254
No! I want two!

1960
01:57:53,827 --> 01:57:55,226
What's going on?

1961
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:59,658
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1962
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:02,797
Oh, these things just don't die.

1963
01:58:06,373 --> 01:58:07,863
Oh, we're so dead.

1964
01:58:07,974 --> 01:58:10,306
- Wrap it around the head. - Sam!

1965
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:11,599
Where's the Cube?

1966
01:58:11,711 --> 01:58:12,678
- Right there. - Okay.

1967
01:58:12,779 --> 01:58:13,768
And take that and wrap it around

1968
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:14,847
the base and then put it around his neck.

1969
01:58:14,948 --> 01:58:17,610
- Okay? - Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1970
01:58:19,052 --> 01:58:20,519
That building.

1971
01:58:24,291 --> 01:58:26,088
- Okay. - What?

1972
01:58:26,192 --> 01:58:29,161
All right, I can't leave my guys back there, so here, take this flare.

1973
01:58:29,262 --> 01:58:31,526
Okay, there's a tall, white building with statues on top.

1974
01:58:31,631 --> 01:58:33,826
- Go to the roof. Set the flare. - No.

1975
01:58:33,934 --> 01:58:35,868
- Signal the chopper and set the flare. - No, no. I can't do this!

1976
01:58:35,969 --> 01:58:40,372
Listen to me! You're a soldier now! All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1977
01:58:40,473 --> 01:58:42,703
Get it into military hands while we hold them off,

1978
01:58:42,809 --> 01:58:44,868
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1979
01:58:45,011 --> 01:58:46,501
- You got to go. You got to go. - No, I'm not leaving.

1980
01:58:46,613 --> 01:58:47,773
- You need to go. Go. - No, I'm not leaving

1981
01:58:47,881 --> 01:58:49,777
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1982
01:58:50,042 --> 01:58:51,794
You always want to re-do things in movies

1983
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,554
and that prop of the Cube is kind of lame.

1984
01:58:54,922 --> 01:58:56,674
You know? It's just...

1985
01:58:57,883 --> 01:59:02,718
It's just not what it should be. But you can't catch everything

1986
01:59:03,013 --> 01:59:06,369
because you've got so many millions of parts moving on.

1987
01:59:07,893 --> 01:59:11,363
Those Black Hawks that are flying through downtown,

1988
01:59:11,605 --> 01:59:12,833
it was the only time in my life

1989
01:59:12,981 --> 01:59:15,131
I've wanted a religious service to end quickly,

1990
01:59:15,317 --> 01:59:20,550
because we were not allowed to fly them close to downtown

1991
01:59:20,864 --> 01:59:24,493
while this religious service was going on, right where Shia is running towards.

1992
01:59:24,743 --> 01:59:27,496
I was even thinking of offering donations

1993
01:59:27,704 --> 01:59:30,502
so that we could continue shooting. They didn't wanna buy that.

1994
01:59:35,128 --> 01:59:36,425
Watch out!

1995
01:59:42,035 --> 01:59:45,061
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here! - I'm going! I'm going!

1996
01:59:45,171 --> 01:59:46,832
Get out of here now!

1997
01:59:53,855 --> 01:59:56,653
When you watch this movie, right here, when you see this,

1998
01:59:56,858 --> 02:00:02,091
you're actually rooting for a truck. I mean, isn't it silly? But it works.

1999
02:00:03,699 --> 02:00:06,850
And this we did digitally, with the Porsche Cayenne coming around.

2000
02:00:07,077 --> 02:00:11,867
Kind of like that shot that I did on Bad Boys where I spun around the guys.

2001
02:00:12,165 --> 02:00:15,874
And I've done it subsequently in The Rock and Armageddon

2002
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:18,437
and why not do it with Optimus Prime here?

2003
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:22,669
Now, Megatron was not a big gun because I just didn't know

2004
02:00:22,926 --> 02:00:25,235
how I would explain him being a big gun.

2005
02:00:25,429 --> 02:00:27,067
Just doesn't make sense.

2006
02:00:29,224 --> 02:00:32,978
Shooting that hotel thing, we shot it with a little, tiny little helicopter.

2007
02:00:33,437 --> 02:00:37,749
With, like a lawnmower engine, it can take a tiny little camera up

2008
02:00:38,025 --> 02:00:40,983
and two guys with remote controls control it.

2009
02:00:43,363 --> 02:00:46,673
We got a lot of flak for the face of Megatron.

2010
02:00:46,909 --> 02:00:49,104
He was a little uglier than he is now.

2011
02:00:49,286 --> 02:00:52,915
And the fans, rightly so, complained about it.

2012
02:00:53,165 --> 02:00:56,521
And we kind of fixed the face. I think he's pretty cool.

2013
02:00:58,086 --> 02:00:59,758
He looks menacing.

2014
02:01:03,926 --> 02:01:07,202
This was done down in Detroit and then smashing into a real set

2015
02:01:07,429 --> 02:01:11,422
here with stuntmen diving out. But shooting the deli shot,

2016
02:01:11,683 --> 02:01:14,151
it was very complicated because we had to shoot it against a blue screen.

2017
02:01:14,353 --> 02:01:17,663
We had to rip up the car, violently, and we had to throw it,

2018
02:01:17,898 --> 02:01:19,650
once it ripped up, into the window.

2019
02:01:19,816 --> 02:01:22,489
So we shoot it, first with people inside the deli,

2020
02:01:22,694 --> 02:01:25,652
then we have Shia run past the deli window, several times.

2021
02:01:25,864 --> 02:01:30,062
Then we rip up the car and we pull it into the window, right here.

2022
02:01:30,327 --> 02:01:33,717
Then we marry them all together to make it look very dangerous.

2023
02:01:33,956 --> 02:01:36,550
This shot with Starscream landing, those are real cars

2024
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,706
that are getting flipped violently.

2025
02:01:38,877 --> 02:01:45,316
Simultaneously, they're being pulled by giant cranes on these canister rigs

2026
02:01:45,676 --> 02:01:49,112
that are just extremely violent when they pull things.

2027
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:58,848
So imagine no robots there and just figuring out timing

2028
02:01:59,106 --> 02:02:02,940
of how long that plane's supposed to transform to it flying out.

2029
02:02:03,193 --> 02:02:07,345
I mean, you really, as you're operating camera,

2030
02:02:07,614 --> 02:02:11,289
it's a little bit of guesswork trying to fit it in.

2031
02:02:15,038 --> 02:02:16,710
There's Ron, you just saw him there,

2032
02:02:16,874 --> 02:02:19,342
the African-American sitting in the chair.

2033
02:02:19,543 --> 02:02:24,822
Ron is homeless and a very intelligent homeless man.

2034
02:02:26,341 --> 02:02:30,732
We offer him money, he doesn't want it. But he is a huge fan of movies.

2035
02:02:31,013 --> 02:02:35,006
And what he does, he knows everything about the film industry.

2036
02:02:35,267 --> 02:02:37,701
He knows so many people in the business,

2037
02:02:37,895 --> 02:02:40,011
and he literally becomes a mascot of the set.

2038
02:02:40,188 --> 02:02:44,181
He followed us wherever we went. He actually rented a car,

2039
02:02:44,443 --> 02:02:47,799
or hitched a way, got a bus ticket, and he made it to Detroit.

2040
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:50,339
And we were all surprised to see him there.

2041
02:02:50,532 --> 02:02:52,887
And I told Ian, "We gotta get him a hotel room."

2042
02:02:53,076 --> 02:02:55,954
And he didn't want it, but we forced him to take it.

2043
02:02:56,997 --> 02:03:01,548
But Ron's gonna be in all my movies from now on. He's a great guy.

2044
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:05,809
That was the train station down in Detroit.

2045
02:03:06,006 --> 02:03:09,521
It's now gonna be, I think, destroyed, so this is the last movie to be shot there.

2046
02:03:48,549 --> 02:03:52,258
So we're doing this scene with these gigantic metal prongs

2047
02:03:52,511 --> 02:03:55,503
that are off the tow truck, and we're actually backing up

2048
02:03:55,722 --> 02:04:00,512
that tow truck and the driver is Cory who is dressed as a girl.

2049
02:04:03,355 --> 02:04:07,587
He's got a little, cute pink top on. He looked frightening as a girl.

2050
02:04:15,659 --> 02:04:16,853
This isn't going well!

2051
02:04:17,077 --> 02:04:18,066
Shoot! Shoot!

2052
02:04:36,722 --> 02:04:40,397
And that shot, where we're flipping the cars up, we have these car flippers

2053
02:04:40,642 --> 02:04:43,475
and it gets as close to possible and it triggers the car flippers

2054
02:04:43,687 --> 02:04:45,484
as the car comes up.

2055
02:05:04,257 --> 02:05:05,485
Nice shot.

2056
02:05:05,591 --> 02:05:09,049
- That tank is definitely dead now. - All right, let's go! We got business!

2057
02:05:11,173 --> 02:05:13,403
Now this scene, where we did downtown on this rooftop,

2058
02:05:13,592 --> 02:05:17,949
it's about 20 stories tall. Shia is escaping from Megatron,

2059
02:05:18,222 --> 02:05:22,181
and he climbs on one of these statues and Ian Bryce, my producer, goes

2060
02:05:22,434 --> 02:05:23,708
"Well, you gonna do this blue screen, right?"

2061
02:05:23,852 --> 02:05:26,571
I said, "No, I wanna do it as real as possible, let's do it real."

2062
02:05:26,772 --> 02:05:29,969
Let's hang Shia out there, let's hang him by a wire.

2063
02:05:37,407 --> 02:05:41,798
This is a Black Hawk, actually, hovering right over an LA building.

2064
02:05:42,079 --> 02:05:46,152
It's kind of an interesting sight having Black Hawks flying through Los Angeles

2065
02:05:46,416 --> 02:05:48,134
at such low altitude.

2066
02:05:50,546 --> 02:05:53,299
Right there, that's the real tail of a helicopter mock-up

2067
02:05:53,507 --> 02:05:55,145
that comes past Shia.

2068
02:05:56,635 --> 02:05:58,751
It's safe because Shia's ducking down,

2069
02:05:58,929 --> 02:06:02,126
but that thing is actually busting plaster, concrete and whatnot.

2070
02:06:02,349 --> 02:06:05,978
But those are the type of shots that I like to involve the actor in.

2071
02:06:06,228 --> 02:06:09,857
'Cause it just gives more intensity and realism to the scene.

2072
02:06:13,735 --> 02:06:16,454
I said to Shia, I said, "Shia, I'm gonna hang you out on this building.

2073
02:06:16,655 --> 02:06:20,204
"And there's not a lot of foot room up there, but you're safe with wires."

2074
02:06:20,450 --> 02:06:23,567
And he says, "Okay, all right, I'm cool, I'll do it, I'll do it."

2075
02:06:23,787 --> 02:06:27,666
Well, literally the moment before he was supposed to go up and get on

2076
02:06:27,916 --> 02:06:31,829
this very secured statue and totally safe wire,

2077
02:06:32,087 --> 02:06:35,124
even though you can't see it, it's on either side of his hip.

2078
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:39,538
He goes, "Mike, come here. I can't do this."

2079
02:06:39,803 --> 02:06:42,715
I said, "Are you kidding me, Shia? You're gonna embarrass yourself

2080
02:06:42,931 --> 02:06:44,728
"in front of the whole crew."

2081
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:48,615
Now, mind you, in my own mind, I would never go out there.

2082
02:06:48,854 --> 02:06:51,732
But I'm a director so I can tell people to do things like that.

2083
02:06:51,940 --> 02:06:53,692
With all the machismo and whatnot.

2084
02:06:53,859 --> 02:06:55,736
"Dude, you're gonna go out there, and you're gonna like it.

2085
02:06:55,903 --> 02:06:58,576
"You get paid way more money than those kids on Fear Factor.

2086
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:01,897
"So get the hell out there." So of course he did it.

2087
02:07:02,117 --> 02:07:04,836
It was an awesome shot, because it's totally real.

2088
02:07:05,037 --> 02:07:08,632
And three minutes into doing it, Shia just loved it.

2089
02:07:12,794 --> 02:07:15,467
I was actually supposed to be hanging out of a Mercedes,

2090
02:07:15,672 --> 02:07:19,460
grabbed by Megatron, and climb out of the sun roof, which I did.

2091
02:07:19,718 --> 02:07:24,587
And they had me wired by a cable where they pulled my ankle up,

2092
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:29,645
and he was supposed to yank me. But in light of not doing that shot,

2093
02:07:29,937 --> 02:07:33,771
I was the guy that got flicked by Megatron and goes into the cab.

2094
02:07:34,024 --> 02:07:35,582
So that is me.

2095
02:07:39,312 --> 02:07:40,336
Sam?

2096
02:07:44,617 --> 02:07:47,848
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

2097
02:07:48,588 --> 02:07:50,055
No sacrifice,

2098
02:07:51,424 --> 02:07:54,484
- no victory. - If I cannot defeat Megatron,

2099
02:07:54,827 --> 02:07:57,318
you must push the Cube into my chest.

2100
02:07:57,730 --> 02:08:00,927
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

2101
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:02,867
Get behind me.

2102
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:07,130
It's you and me, Megatron.

2103
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:10,175
No, it's just me, Prime.

2104
02:08:12,612 --> 02:08:17,743
At the end of this day, one shall stand, one shall fall.

2105
02:08:23,155 --> 02:08:27,990
You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose!

2106
02:08:47,146 --> 02:08:49,546
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

2107
02:08:49,649 --> 02:08:52,117
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys. Targets will be marked.

2108
02:08:52,218 --> 02:08:53,242
Hey.

2109
02:08:54,453 --> 02:08:56,614
Bring the rain. All right?

2110
02:08:57,023 --> 02:08:59,014
All right, let's kill these things.

2111
02:09:00,993 --> 02:09:02,551
- Move, move, move! - Remember, aim low.

2112
02:09:02,662 --> 02:09:04,653
Armor's weak under the chest.

2113
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:16,298
Target marked. Still waiting.

2114
02:09:16,409 --> 02:09:18,434
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

2115
02:09:25,384 --> 02:09:27,477
F-22s, we're still waiting.

2116
02:09:32,725 --> 02:09:34,158
Move out!

2117
02:09:37,396 --> 02:09:38,624
Incoming!

2118
02:09:47,173 --> 02:09:49,266
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

2119
02:10:07,927 --> 02:10:09,758
Run! Move!

2120
02:10:17,269 --> 02:10:18,793
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

2121
02:10:22,308 --> 02:10:23,900
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

2122
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:26,178
<i>- Copy. - It's either a massive amount of...</i>

2123
02:10:26,363 --> 02:10:29,241
Doing the aerial shots, basically I'm having my helicopter pilot

2124
02:10:29,449 --> 02:10:34,443
fly with a VistaVision, which is a much wider negative,

2125
02:10:34,746 --> 02:10:38,785
larger, so you can move it around a bit. And he's flying as fast as he can go

2126
02:10:39,042 --> 02:10:42,000
through these buildings and around.

2127
02:10:42,212 --> 02:10:43,645
It's kind of, very much

2128
02:10:44,423 --> 02:10:46,778
how we did some of our Pearl Harbor stuff.

2129
02:10:46,967 --> 02:10:51,518
And I had actually some of the same plane animators that worked on Pearl

2130
02:10:51,805 --> 02:10:53,284
work on this.

2131
02:10:59,813 --> 02:11:03,886
When I went to test screen this movie with the studio,

2132
02:11:04,151 --> 02:11:08,508
we did it in Arizona, and we were doing a family theatre

2133
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:13,137
where it was a bunch of kids at 5:00, with parents.

2134
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:16,766
And then we were doing an adult screening with adults

2135
02:11:16,997 --> 02:11:22,515
at about 8:00, and they were both 500-person houses.

2136
02:11:22,836 --> 02:11:25,873
So they're very large. What I do when I put my movies together

2137
02:11:26,089 --> 02:11:29,559
is I actually will put a small group in a screening room.

2138
02:11:29,801 --> 02:11:33,555
Different-aged kids, where they'll watch a very rough cut, give me some ideas.

2139
02:11:33,805 --> 02:11:35,955
It's very good to just have to show your movie up on a bigger screen

2140
02:11:36,141 --> 02:11:39,338
so you can see it and put it in front of people.

2141
02:11:39,561 --> 02:11:42,678
You can see where they get confused, what they're liking, what's not working.

2142
02:11:42,898 --> 02:11:46,686
So I did that twice. First started with nine-year-olds to 1 6.

2143
02:11:46,944 --> 02:11:50,493
And then I went from 1 6 to 25-year-olds.

2144
02:11:50,739 --> 02:11:52,331
And it prepared me for my studio screening.

2145
02:11:52,491 --> 02:11:55,085
Even being a final cut director, it's still intense.

2146
02:11:55,285 --> 02:11:56,638
Because they come there

2147
02:11:56,787 --> 02:11:59,221
with 30 people from Paramount and DreamWorks.

2148
02:11:59,414 --> 02:12:00,927
Everyone is nervous.

2149
02:12:01,083 --> 02:12:04,200
They determine what they're gonna spend on advertising.

2150
02:12:04,419 --> 02:12:08,128
That very moment, you get numbers. So we watched it with the families.

2151
02:12:08,382 --> 02:12:10,657
It went well, they were laughing at the different jokes,

2152
02:12:10,842 --> 02:12:13,276
they were not laughing at some of the adult jokes.

2153
02:12:13,470 --> 02:12:16,189
There were several applause through the screening.

2154
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:19,268
And I'm like, "That's kind of fun, but odd.

2155
02:12:19,476 --> 02:12:22,707
"They're applauding three or four times during the screening."

2156
02:12:22,938 --> 02:12:25,532
Then I quickly ran over to the adult theatre.

2157
02:12:25,732 --> 02:12:28,371
So I saw the adult one start up, then I ran back to the kids one

2158
02:12:28,569 --> 02:12:31,402
where we did a focus group, 26 people.

2159
02:12:31,613 --> 02:12:34,411
Guy stands up saying, "I have nothing to do with this movie.

2160
02:12:34,616 --> 02:12:36,095
"How would you rate this movie?"

2161
02:12:36,243 --> 02:12:40,555
Excellent, blah blah blah, very good, poor, good, whatever.

2162
02:12:40,831 --> 02:12:45,746
All 26 hands raised at "Excellent." And I'm like, "Well, okay, it's a fluke,

2163
02:12:46,044 --> 02:12:48,842
"it's a family thing, whatever." Then I ran back to the adult screening.

2164
02:12:49,047 --> 02:12:52,722
And I sat next to this guy, I was just sitting in some random aisle seat

2165
02:12:52,968 --> 02:12:55,436
where I had a little sound box where I got to control the volume

2166
02:12:55,637 --> 02:13:00,233
because the volume is not really precise because it's not fully mixed sound.

2167
02:13:00,517 --> 02:13:04,305
It's a little abrasive at times. And the guy knew I was a director

2168
02:13:04,563 --> 02:13:07,396
because I told him, 'cause he asked what that box was.

2169
02:13:07,608 --> 02:13:10,281
Halfway through the movie, the people are really enjoying it,

2170
02:13:10,485 --> 02:13:13,716
you can see the adults are laughing. And I asked this guy, he was about 30,

2171
02:13:13,947 --> 02:13:17,781
I said, "So do you like this kind of movie?"

2172
02:13:18,035 --> 02:13:21,471
And he looked at me and goes, "Yeah, not really my thing, not really."

2173
02:13:21,705 --> 02:13:24,663
So I'm thinking, "This movie sucks. It's just going to be a kids' movie.

2174
02:13:24,875 --> 02:13:29,153
"All right, fine. It'll be a kids' movie." Every emotion goes through your body

2175
02:13:29,421 --> 02:13:32,538
when you're a director sitting there and watching

2176
02:13:32,758 --> 02:13:35,716
500 people at a time see your movie.

2177
02:13:35,969 --> 02:13:39,120
And they don't care who you are, what you are, nothing.

2178
02:13:39,348 --> 02:13:43,307
They'll tell you, they'll be frank as...

2179
02:13:45,062 --> 02:13:47,860
It can be a brutalizing experience, because they will tell you

2180
02:13:48,065 --> 02:13:51,182
how bad or good your movie is. Then we did a focus group

2181
02:13:51,401 --> 02:13:54,871
with the adults and we had a huge round of applause

2182
02:13:55,113 --> 02:13:57,911
at the end of the movie. And I'm like, "That's kind of odd.

2183
02:13:58,116 --> 02:14:00,346
"These are adults. This is a robot movie.

2184
02:14:00,536 --> 02:14:04,848
"What are they applauding for? I thought that this was a kids' movie."

2185
02:14:05,123 --> 02:14:08,354
So we go to this focus group.

2186
02:14:08,585 --> 02:14:12,339
And this woman who is, I gotta tell you, she was like 40.

2187
02:14:12,589 --> 02:14:15,899
And she says...And this was after they raised their hands,

2188
02:14:16,134 --> 02:14:21,527
which out of 26 people, 24 of them raised at "Excellent" and 2, "Very good."

2189
02:14:22,391 --> 02:14:23,824
And I'm thinking,

2190
02:14:23,976 --> 02:14:26,171
"Well, that's kind of odd, 'cause that just never happens."

2191
02:14:26,353 --> 02:14:30,471
That's a lot of people saying "Excellent."

2192
02:14:32,109 --> 02:14:34,020
And this woman raised her hand.

2193
02:14:34,194 --> 02:14:37,425
She says, "I was dragged to this movie. I didn't want to see this movie."

2194
02:14:37,656 --> 02:14:40,295
And she goes, "But you know what?

2195
02:14:40,492 --> 02:14:44,041
"This movie, it reinvents the superheroes."

2196
02:14:44,288 --> 02:14:47,121
She goes, "I'm tired of the capes and the suits and all that stuff,

2197
02:14:47,332 --> 02:14:50,608
"and this totally is something new and different that I've never seen before."

2198
02:14:50,836 --> 02:14:52,064
And that's when it kind of hit me.

2199
02:14:52,212 --> 02:14:54,521
And then we got the numbers from the kids' audience

2200
02:14:54,715 --> 02:15:00,153
which was a 94. That's a huge score. I've never had that score in my life.

2201
02:15:00,470 --> 02:15:02,028
I mean, that's a massive number.

2202
02:15:02,973 --> 02:15:03,530
Then we got the adult score.

2203
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:05,517
It was the exact same, 94.

2204
02:15:05,684 --> 02:15:08,994
So obviously the studio is doing cartwheels.

2205
02:15:09,229 --> 02:15:13,108
I guess it was a good experience as far as movie testing goes.

2206
02:15:18,488 --> 02:15:20,604
The parents here were something that the audience,

2207
02:15:20,782 --> 02:15:24,855
they all felt, what happened to them? So this is an additional scene I shot

2208
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:28,112
just to let people into what happened to them

2209
02:15:28,332 --> 02:15:30,323
and that they're keeping this conspiracy going.

2210
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,570
Likewise, they also wanted to know what happened to Starscream.

2211
02:15:32,753 --> 02:15:35,665
So I added it again, where you see him go back into space.

2212
02:15:35,881 --> 02:15:39,078
What they told me in that test was I had to fix this ending.

2213
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:41,371
And a lot of times, if they don't like the ending, an audience,

2214
02:15:41,553 --> 02:15:44,272
they'll actually be harder on the grading of the movie.

2215
02:15:44,473 --> 02:15:48,625
But somehow, there was so much goodwill to this movie, that they...

2216
02:15:49,978 --> 02:15:53,015
They still gave it a very high score.

2217
02:15:53,232 --> 02:15:56,349
I had to fix some issues with the Cube.

2218
02:15:56,568 --> 02:16:00,243
I had to show...It was very vague for them to understand

2219
02:16:00,489 --> 02:16:03,322
what Sam had to do by pushing the Cube into his chest.

2220
02:16:03,534 --> 02:16:05,206
So we had to do something about the observatory

2221
02:16:05,369 --> 02:16:09,726
with Optimus showing the spark. And talking about,

2222
02:16:09,998 --> 02:16:14,469
he'll put it into his own chest. And then we had to do a few more shots

2223
02:16:14,753 --> 02:16:17,187
with Sam pushing it into Megatron's chest,

2224
02:16:17,381 --> 02:16:20,771
just to clarify the ending.

2225
02:16:21,009 --> 02:16:24,604
It's been a bizarre experience traveling with this movie

2226
02:16:24,846 --> 02:16:26,438
to so many different countries.

2227
02:16:26,598 --> 02:16:30,034
And even Japan, where I just saw a screening with 4,500 people.

2228
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:34,508
In Japan, it's funny, they'll tell you, "The movie's so funny, it's so funny."

2229
02:16:34,773 --> 02:16:37,082
But you watch it, and you wanna kill yourself.

2230
02:16:37,276 --> 02:16:40,029
Because you got 4,500 people sitting there, not emoting at all

2231
02:16:40,237 --> 02:16:43,912
because it's impolite to laugh in Japan when you're watching a movie.

2232
02:16:44,157 --> 02:16:46,273
But then they gave it huge applause at the end,

2233
02:16:46,451 --> 02:16:49,204
which is something that they don't do as well.

2234
02:16:49,413 --> 02:16:51,847
And Japanese theatre people

2235
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:55,430
that are distributors there, they were just saying, "That's a very good sign."

2236
02:16:55,669 --> 02:16:58,342
So it opens in Japan...l guess when you get this DVD

2237
02:16:58,547 --> 02:17:03,621
it will have already opened in Japan, but this is a week before it opens.

2238
02:17:06,555 --> 02:17:10,707
In the Asian countries, it's just been phenomenal.

2239
02:17:10,976 --> 02:17:13,410
I mean, Korea, it's the number one movie of all time,

2240
02:17:13,770 --> 02:17:16,364
at $50-million something.

2241
02:17:16,732 --> 02:17:19,246
Malaysia, it's the number one movie of all time.

2242
02:17:19,443 --> 02:17:25,359
It's the biggest opening in China of all time. It's just crazy.

2243
02:17:26,033 --> 02:17:29,787
Transformers was the most fun experience I've had directing a movie.

2244
02:17:30,037 --> 02:17:34,349
It was definitely challenging, but a lot of my movies have been challenging.

2245
02:17:34,625 --> 02:17:38,982
It was a new experience for me in that working almost like

2246
02:17:39,254 --> 02:17:43,372
on an animation movie with live action.

2247
02:17:45,135 --> 02:17:50,414
I can't wait to get started on 2. The experience of it coming out

2248
02:17:50,724 --> 02:17:55,320
and the way it's been accepted around the world has been staggering to me.

2249
02:17:55,604 --> 02:17:57,720
The fans have...

2250
02:17:57,898 --> 02:18:02,210
The death threats stopped. I'm very glad, you know?

2251
02:18:02,486 --> 02:18:05,159
I think I've made a lot of the fans very happy.

2252
02:18:05,364 --> 02:18:09,642
I mean, I know I have. They've told me.

2253
02:18:11,411 --> 02:18:15,199
So many have said, "Thanks for making my childhood dreams come true."

2254
02:18:15,457 --> 02:18:17,971
It's like they've all dreamed of this movie.

2255
02:18:19,169 --> 02:18:25,199
So that's a really nice feeling. But it's an even nicer feeling to see older people

2256
02:18:25,551 --> 02:18:29,544
that knew nothing of Transformers to actually really enjoy this movie.

2257
02:18:29,805 --> 02:18:32,922
And I'm just proud to have worked with the people I've worked with.

2258
02:18:33,141 --> 02:18:35,530
And I can't wait to do it again.

2259
02:18:36,854 --> 02:18:40,210
It was a delight to work with the writers.

2260
02:18:41,567 --> 02:18:44,604
Kurtzman and Orci, I don't know if they're going to write 2,

2261
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:47,778
because they don't know if there's any magic left.

2262
02:18:47,990 --> 02:18:50,458
They've gotta be wrong with that, you know?

2263
02:18:50,909 --> 02:18:56,063
So I'm about to hear many, many pitches.

2264
02:18:56,373 --> 02:18:58,887
But I know that Transformers 2, if I do it,

2265
02:18:59,084 --> 02:19:02,554
I definitely want to take it to a whole other visual level.

2266
02:19:03,839 --> 02:19:08,754
I think this movie has definitely raised the bar of visual effects.

2267
02:19:09,678 --> 02:19:13,432
In terms of realistic visual effects and what can be done.

2268
02:19:13,682 --> 02:19:17,277
It's almost anything what a director thinks can be done, nowadays.

2269
02:19:18,395 --> 02:19:21,705
It's amazing how effects jump every single year.

2270
02:19:23,817 --> 02:19:27,856
I'll look forward to doing it again. So thanks for listening to me.

2271
02:19:29,531 --> 02:19:34,286
Some of it, I hope I'm not blabbing. It's hard to sit in a dark room, right here,

2272
02:19:34,578 --> 02:19:38,253
with a microphone in front of you and talk for three hours.

2273
02:19:39,625 --> 02:19:41,581
Till next time, see you.
