1
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,485
<i>Before time began, there was the Cube.</i>

2
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,151
<i>We know not where it comes from,</i>

3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,495
<i>only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.</i>

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,094
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

5
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,671
<i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i>

6
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:19,336
<i>but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.</i>

7
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,577
<i>And so began the war,</i>

8
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,710
<i>a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,</i>

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,953
<i>and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.</i>

10
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,360
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,</i>

11
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>searching every star, every world.</i>

12
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us</i>

13
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,980
<i>to an unknown planet called Earth.</i>

14
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,255
<i>But we were already too late.</i>

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,795
<i>Oh, God, five months of this.</i>

16
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,397
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,534
<i>A plate of mama's alligators  Átouff Áe.</i>

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,805
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,076
<i>for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.</i>

20
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,482
<i>But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.</i>

21
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,644
I understand.

22
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,521
<i>English, please. English.</i>

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,323
<i>I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.</i>

24
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,625
<i>Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.</i>

25
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,663
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,798
<i>Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.</i>

27
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,638
<i>What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?</i>

29
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,780
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,375
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

31
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,454
Shut up!

32
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,375
<i>Hey, I'm ready to do this.</i>

33
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
<i>Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.</i>

34
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,570
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

35
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,878
<i>Watch this crossover, baby.</i>

36
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,147
<i>Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.</i>

37
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,149
<i>- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?</i>

38
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,521
<i>- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?</i>

39
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,220
- Water?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,895
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,371
<i>Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.</i>

42
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,606
<i>Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.</i>

43
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,516
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,453
<i>Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.</i>

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,393
<i>Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.</i>

46
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:33,037
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

47
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,267
<i>If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.</i>

48
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,577
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,239
<i>Tail 4500 X-ray.</i>

50
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
<i>Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.</i>

51
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,748
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,912
<i>- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.</i>

53
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,990
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,591
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

55
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,027
<i>- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.</i>

56
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,265
<i>- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.</i>

57
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,268
<i>- My ladies!
- Look.</i>

58
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,373
<i>Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.</i>

59
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,606
<i>Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.</i>

60
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,439
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,677
<i>I know that people say that all the time,</i>

62
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,152
<i>but, wow, we made
one good-Iooking kid. Nice work.</i>

63
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,018
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,717
<i>- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.</i>

65
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,761
<i>You sure she didn't just fart?</i>

66
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,659
<i>No, she's a lady.</i>

67
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,255
<i>She doesn't know you yet, but she will.</i>

68
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,670
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,405
<i>Bogie's on the deck.</i>

70
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,642
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.</i>

71
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,014
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,682
<i>- Will?
- Sarah?</i>

73
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,191
<i>Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.</i>

74
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,623
<i>Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.</i>

75
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,322
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

76
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,398
<i>MH-53 pilot, power down now.</i>

77
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,765
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

78
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,619
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

79
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,855
My God.

80
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,143
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

81
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,344
Go! Move! Move!

82
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,983
It's going after the files!

83
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,454
Cut the hard lines!

84
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
I need a key! It's locked!

85
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,022
Move! Move!

86
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,735
<i>Here, come here! Come here!</i>

87
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,781
<i>Here, hide in here!</i>

88
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,986
<i>Oh, my God. Okay.</i>

89
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,647
No!

90
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,428
Oh!

91
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,236
What the...

92
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,947
<i>Epps, let's go!</i>

93
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,403
<i>Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.</i>

94
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,140
<i>Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.</i>

95
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,437
Watch.

96
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,545
Okay.

97
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,242
For my family...

98
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,785
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

99
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,056
Okay.

100
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,183
<i>So, for my family genealogy report,</i>

101
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,422
<i>I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,</i>

102
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,766
<i>who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.</i>

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
Very famous explorer.

104
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:35,796
<i>In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.</i>

105
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:43,104
<i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.</i>

106
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
<i>Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!</i>

107
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,723
<i>The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!</i>

108
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,656
<i>Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!</i>

109
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,164
<i>We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!</i>

110
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,364
<i>So that's the story, right?</i>

111
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,665
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

112
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,603
used by 19th-century seamen.

113
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,910
<i>This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.</i>

114
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,308
<i>It's all for sale, by the way.</i>

115
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:18,111
<i>Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.</i>

116
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,683
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

117
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,516
<i>I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.</i>

118
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,853
Are you going to sell me his liver?

119
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,552
<i>Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.</i>

120
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,753
I don't think your grandfather would be

121
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,090
particularly proud of what you're doing.

122
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,428
<i>I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.</i>

123
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,592
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

124
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,033
<i>Cold hard cash works, too.</i>

125
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,435
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

126
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,870
- Sam!
- Sorry.

127
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,803
<i>Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,</i>

128
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,744
<i>the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,</i>

129
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,008
drawing these strange symbols

130
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,584
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

131
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,346
that he thought he'd discovered.

132
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,287
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

133
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,689
<i>- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?</i>

134
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,125
<i>- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.</i>

135
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,789
<i>Okay. Pretty good, right?</i>

136
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
<i>I'd say a solid B- .</i>

137
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,826
A B-?

138
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,963
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

139
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,234
<i>- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...</i>

140
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,570
<i>- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?</i>

141
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,009
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

142
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,670
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

143
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,409
<i>Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.</i>

144
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
And a man's promise to that boy.

145
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,218
<i>He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.</i>

146
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
<i>"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."</i>

147
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,818
<i>Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.</i>

148
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,987
<i>Okay? Here's the dream. Your B- .
Dream gone. Kaput.</i>

149
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,891
<i>Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?</i>

150
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,633
<i>Yes! Yes, yes.</i>

151
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,140
So?

152
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,441
<i>A- . It's an A, though.</i>

153
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
<i>Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.</i>

154
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,105
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

155
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,110
<i>- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...</i>

156
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
<i>Yeah, a little surprise.</i>

157
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,081
<i>No. No, no, no, no. Dad!</i>

158
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,547
<i>- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?</i>

159
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,594
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

160
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,959
<i>- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.</i>

161
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

162
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,297
a Porsche for your first car?

163
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

164
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,199
<i>- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.</i>

165
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,815
- Manny!
- What?

166
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,377
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

167
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,577
He's having a heat stroke again.

168
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,744
Scaring white folks.

169
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,754
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

170
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,184
<i>Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,</i>

171
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,850
<i>not half a piece of crap, Dad.</i>

172
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,326
<i>When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.</i>

173
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,897
<i>Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?</i>

174
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
<i>- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.</i>

175
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,527
<i>Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.</i>

176
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,399
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

177
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
<i>- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.</i>

178
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,069
<i>- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.</i>

179
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,233
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,110
<i>Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.</i>

181
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,306
How can I help you?

182
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,179
<i>Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.</i>

183
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,179
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

184
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,657
<i>That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.</i>

185
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,125
<i>- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.</i>

186
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,090
<i>Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.</i>

187
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
<i>Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.</i>

188
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,232
The car'll pick the driver.

189
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,137
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

190
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,143
<i>Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.</i>

191
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,773
<i>Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!</i>

192
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,544
<i>Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.</i>

193
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,714
<i>I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?</i>

194
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:52,353
<i>Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.</i>

195
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,897
This ain't bad.

196
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,226
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,667
It got racing...

198
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,170
<i>Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?</i>

199
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,036
I don't know nothing about this car.

200
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,370
- Manny!
- What?

201
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,070
What is this? This car! Check it out!

202
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,670
<i>I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!</i>

203
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,273
<i>Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!</i>

204
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,908
Feels good.

205
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,483
<i>- How much?
- Well,</i>

206
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,453
<i>considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,</i>

207
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,359
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

208
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,525
<i>- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.</i>

209
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
It's custom faded?

210
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,533
<i>Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.</i>

211
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,437
<i>- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.</i>

212
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,434
<i>Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.</i>

213
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
<i>No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.</i>

214
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,409
<i>Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.</i>

215
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,678
<i>Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.</i>

216
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

217
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,615
<i>No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.</i>

218
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,749
This is a classic engine right here.

219
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,191
I sold a car the other day...

220
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,663
Gee. Holy cow.

221
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,198
<i>- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?</i>

222
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,066
<i>I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!</i>

223
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,831
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

224
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,066
<i>and come bang this stuff out, baby!</i>

225
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,109
<i>... greater than man...</i>

226
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,304
<i>That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.</i>

227
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,530
<i>$4,000.</i>

228
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,336
Steve.

229
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,345
<i>Hello, Mr. Secretary.</i>

230
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,941
They're so young.

231
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,178
<i>They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.</i>

232
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,550
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

233
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,022
<i>Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.</i>

234
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,123
I am so underdressed.

235
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,220
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.</i>

236
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,761
Please be seated.

237
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,798
I'm John Keller.

238
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,170
<i>Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.</i>

239
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,443
<i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i>

240
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,742
<i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.</i>

241
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,213
<i>So far as we know,
there were no survivors.</i>

242
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,918
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

243
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,149
<i>We're not sure
exactly what they're after,</i>

244
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,693
<i>but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,</i>

245
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,662
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

246
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
<i>Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.</i>

247
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,161
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

248
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

249
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,010
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

250
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,587
<i>and intercept further communications,</i>

251
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,486
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

252
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,789
<i>Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.</i>

253
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,492
<i>We're on a hair-trigger here, people.</i>

254
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,192
The President has dispatched
battle groups

255
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,464
<i>to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.</i>

256
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,198
<i>Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.</i>

257
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,207
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

258
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,833
Good luck to us all.

259
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,723
<i>All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.</i>

260
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,422
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

261
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,654
Zero bids.

262
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,430
Great. Broke.

263
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,901
<i>Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?</i>

264
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,203
No. Premature.

265
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,638
Good. What's up?

266
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,575
<i>Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.</i>

267
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
It's like clockwork.

268
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,774
<i>All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,</i>

269
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,943
<i>but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?</i>

270
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

271
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,552
<i>- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.</i>

272
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,854
This one is wobbly.

273
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,057
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

274
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,291
- Sam...
- What?

275
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
I do not like footprints on my grass.

276
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,264
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

277
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,066
<i>So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?</i>

278
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,300
<i>- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,</i>

279
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,502
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

280
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,704
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

281
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,974
<i>He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.</i>

282
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,640
That's his bling.

283
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,951
I want you home at 11:00!

284
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,918
<i>- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!</i>

285
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,148
<i>Please, for the love of God, drive safely.</i>

286
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,485
Seat belt on!

287
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,458
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,569
<i>Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.</i>

289
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,973
<i>At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.</i>

290
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,484
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

291
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,</i>

292
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,647
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

293
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,685
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
that we have not come across before.

295
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
<i>But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...</i>

296
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,226
<i>Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.</i>

297
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,059
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

298
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,032
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

300
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,906
<i>except in, like, comic book stuff, right?</i>

302
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,311
<i>- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?</i>

303
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,574
<i>My mama, she had the gift, you know?</i>

304
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,653
<i>She saw things. I got the gene, too,</i>

305
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,717
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,019
<i>and get us the hell out of here, huh?</i>

308
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,496
<i>When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.</i>

309
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,464
It looked right at me.

310
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
<i>All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.</i>

311
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,007
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

312
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

313
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,538
<i>- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

314
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,615
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

315
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

316
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,012
<i>All right, let's hit it.</i>

317
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,788
<i>Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?</i>

318
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,760
<i>Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.</i>

319
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

320
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,329
<i>Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?</i>

321
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,994
<i>- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.</i>

322
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,071
Okay.

323
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,740
<i>Hey, guys, check it out.</i>

324
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,213
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

325
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,409
<i>Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.</i>

326
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,615
<i>So, what are you guys doing here?</i>

327
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,225
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

329
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,397
<i>- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.</i>

330
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,467
<i>You tried out for the football team
last year, right?</i>

331
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,333
Let's go call your mom.

332
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,339
<i>Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.</i>

333
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,137
I was researching a book I was writing.

334
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,541
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

335
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,145
<i>No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.</i>

337
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,483
<i>No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.</i>

338
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,752
<i>You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,</i>

339
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,419
<i>sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.</i>

340
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,222
That's funny.

341
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,024
<i>Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.</i>

342
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,099
<i>Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.</i>

343
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,263
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

344
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,967
<i>Just get out of the tree
right now, please.</i>

345
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
What are you doing?

346
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,270
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

347
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,814
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,181
<i>- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.</i>

349
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,255
<i>These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.</i>

350
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,348
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,694
<i>God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.</i>

352
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,299
Okay.

353
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,200
You'll call me.

354
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,509
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

355
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,101
<i>Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?</i>

356
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,113
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

357
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,843
<i>She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.</i>

358
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
<i>She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.</i>

359
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,948
<i>You got to be understanding
here, all right?</i>

360
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,453
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

361
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,183
<i>- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.</i>

362
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,088
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,524
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

364
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
Bros before hos.

365
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,692
<i>Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?</i>

366
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,786
You can't do this to me.

367
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,991
You got to get out of my car right now.

368
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,274
<i>Who's gonna come around
when you break?</i>

369
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,242
Mikaela! It's Sam.

370
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,368
Witwicky.

371
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,040
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

372
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,115
You sure?

373
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,979
<i>So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.</i>

374
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,542
<i>I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.</i>

375
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,783
There you go.

376
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,897
So...

377
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,168
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

378
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,234
<i>You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.</i>

379
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,367
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.</i>

380
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,710
<i>I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.</i>

381
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,808
<i>'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,</i>

382
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,446
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,117
Big arms?

384
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,857
<i>Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.</i>

385
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,453
<i>Like, I just put in that light there.</i>

386
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,991
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

387
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
Yeah.

388
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,510
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,443
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

390
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,582
<i>Yeah, a long time.</i>

393
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,586
<i>Well, do we have any classes together?</i>

394
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,246
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?</i>

395
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,848
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

396
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,222
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

397
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,764
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

398
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,526
<i>God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...</i>

399
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,328
<i>- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.</i>

400
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,869
<i>Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.</i>

401
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,870
<i>No, no, no. No. Come on.</i>

402
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,677
<i>Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.</i>

403
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,240
<i>When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing</i>

404
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,079
<i>This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...</i>

405
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,880
<i>Sexual healing</i>

406
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,217
<i>Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...</i>

407
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,292
<i>I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.</i>

408
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,792
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,590
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

410
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,028
<i>- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.</i>

411
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,463
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,627
<i>I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.</i>

413
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,231
<i>I feel good</i>

414
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,738
Just pop the hood.

415
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,370
<i>Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.</i>

416
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,041
<i>Whoa, nice headers.</i>

417
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,705
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

418
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,216
<i>That's pretty impressive, Sam.</i>

419
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,546
Double-pump?

420
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,349
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,119
I like to go faster.

422
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:32,160
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,093
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:40,227
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,774
<i>I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.</i>

426
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,070
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

427
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,166
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

428
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,837
<i>Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.</i>

429
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,973
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

430
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,711
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

431
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,686
<i>Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.</i>

432
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,347
<i>I prefer it, actually.</i>

433
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,323
<i>- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.</i>

434
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,622
<i>- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.</i>

435
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,165
<i>You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?</i>

436
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,028
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

437
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,799
Good luck with your car.

438
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,266
All right.

439
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,310
<i>Walking's healthy, right?</i>

440
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,674
<i>Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

441
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,346
<i>Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.</i>

442
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,284
<i>Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.</i>

443
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,855
<i>Baby come back
any kind of fool could see</i>

444
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,219
Hey!

445
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,256
<i>There was something
in everything about you</i>

446
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,458
<i>Baby come back
you can blame it all on me</i>

447
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,900
Hey!

448
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,167
Wait a second!

449
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,800
<i>I was wrong
and I just can't live without you</i>

450
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,971
There it is.

451
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,450
<i>I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.</i>

452
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,184
<i>- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?</i>

453
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,485
<i>I think you're... No, no, no.</i>

454
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,195
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

455
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,135
Okay.

456
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,104
Yeah.

457
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,730
<i>All right, I'll see you at school.</i>

458
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,899
All right.

459
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,281
That's stupid.

460
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,640
That was a stupid line.

461
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,549
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

462
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,321
<i>Oh, God.</i>

463
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,317
<i>Oh, my God. I love my car.</i>

464
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:58,867
<i>Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.</i>

465
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,640
<i>Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.</i>

466
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,513
<i>- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?</i>

467
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,213
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

468
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,722
<i>This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.</i>

469
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,885
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,</i>

470
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,190
<i>we'll know just what to do with them.</i>

471
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,893
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,309
<i>Apparently, there are
very few survivors.</i>

473
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,612
<i>Yes, Mr. President?</i>

474
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,655
<i>Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?</i>

475
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,862
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,198
Shoot.

477
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,903
Gross.

478
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,769
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,304
Are you getting this?

480
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,942
I think they're hacking
the network again.

481
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,293
<i>Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.</i>

482
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,233
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

483
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,328
<i>- Yes, you should.
- So I am.</i>

484
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,748
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

485
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,377
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,352
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

487
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,981
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

488
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,289
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,919
Code Red. We have a breach.

490
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,760
<i>Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.</i>

491
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,631
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

492
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,640
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

493
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,870
<i>- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?</i>

494
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,675
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

495
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,774
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,204
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,776
What the...

498
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,650
<i>Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

499
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,586
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

500
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
I want our President in that bunker.

501
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,803
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,007
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,242
Air Force One is on the ground.

504
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,977
<i>Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

505
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,376
That's my car!

506
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,152
No!

507
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,383
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

508
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,026
<i>Dad, call the cops!</i>

509
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,932
<i>Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?</i>

510
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,772
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

511
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,336
<i>I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.</i>

512
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,246
<i>Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?</i>

513
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,013
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

514
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,211
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

515
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,036
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,075
<i>Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?</i>

517
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,906
<i>Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,</i>

518
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,378
<i>and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.</i>

519
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,473
<i>I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...</i>

520
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,212
<i>Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.</i>

521
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,288
<i>I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.</i>

522
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,094
No! No! No! No!

523
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,004
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

524
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,099
<i>No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!</i>

525
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,402
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

526
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:55,414
<i>Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!</i>

527
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,687
<i>Okay. Please, please don't kill me!</i>

528
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,123
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

529
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,363
<i>Listen, listen, listen.</i>

530
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,796
<i>- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!</i>

531
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,458
<i>- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.</i>

532
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,628
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

533
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,302
Put your head on the hood.

534
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,318
<i>Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,</i>

535
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,949
<i>which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.</i>

536
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,687
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

537
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,923
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,660
<i>We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.</i>

539
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,759
<i>- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,</i>

540
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,395
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

541
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,564
It's become the system.

542
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,837
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

543
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,536
The only countries
with this kind of capability

544
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,943
<i>are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.</i>

545
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,983
<i>- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.</i>

546
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,314
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,251
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,483
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

549
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,622
<i>- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,</i>

550
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,356
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

551
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,126
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,963
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,537
<i>Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery</i>

554
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,970
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

555
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,566
<i>Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?</i>

556
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,044
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

557
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,411
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,711
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

559
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,151
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

560
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,746
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,257
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,023
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

563
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,057
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

564
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,498
<i>Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,</i>

565
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,093
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,141
<i>on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?</i>

567
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,050
<i>Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.</i>

568
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,318
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

569
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,551
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,786
<i>Okay, chiefie.</i>

571
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,957
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,862
What are you rolling?

573
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,767
<i>- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?</i>

575
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,368
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,235
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,973
<i>- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...</i>

578
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,213
What was that?

579
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,051
<i>You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?</i>

580
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,683
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

581
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,993
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,629
Are you on drugs?

583
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,440
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,449
<i>Hey, heads up!</i>

585
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,180
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

586
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
What the heck was that?

587
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,098
<i>English, dude. English.</i>

588
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,634
Whoa!

589
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,800
Watch out!

590
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,552

Get up! Get up! Come on!

Go! Move it!

Where's your papa?

Papa!

<i>Sir, we need... I need a telephone.</i>

Fire!

This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

607
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,745
It's an emergency Pentagon...

608
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,752
I don't have a credit card!

609

<i>Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.</i>

610
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,761
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

611
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:15,168
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

612
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,804
Ammo!

613
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,537
I need a credit card!

614
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,277
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

615
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,646
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

616
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:32,950
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

617
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,952
<i>All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!</i>

618
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,051
<i>Okay, it's Visa.</i>

619
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,557
<i>Also, sir, have you heard about</i>

620
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,756
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

621
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:46,997
<i>No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!</i>

622
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,269
Give me a status.

623
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,236
<i>Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.</i>

624
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,040
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

625
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,113
Survivors?

626
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,612
I ain't never seen this in my life!

627
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,449
<i>Need gunships on station ASAP!</i>

<i>Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...</i>

631
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,462
Predator ETA two minutes.

632
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,179
Hey! Make way!

633
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,111
- What is that?
- I don't know.

634
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,088
We need air support
and we need it now.

635
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,288
Roll in strike package Bravo

<i>Weapons, I just got a call
from Falcon Ops.</i>

639

<i>Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?</i>

640
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:58,998
<i>- Send the Hogs, sir.
- Okay, send the Hogs over</i>

641
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,804
<i>to Kill Box One Alpha.
It's a danger close...</i>

642
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,436
<i>Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha,
300 feet danger close.</i>

- Laze the target!

650
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,233
We got a beam-rider incoming!
Laze target!

651
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,211
- Ready! Heat's coming!

00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,913
<i>Receiving radar jamming

<i>Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells.

<i>Be advised, ground team is requesting

<i>Warthog One confirm visual

661

- I'm sorry.
- Black Hawk...

663

We'll get a medic. Just hold on.
He's got a pulse.

664
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,294
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.

665

Bring them home.

There's only one hacker in the world

<i>Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!</i>

<i>- Maggie?

<i>No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.</i>

673
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,606

- Glen! Who is it?

674
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,840
<i>Shut up, Grandma!</i>

675
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,383
<i>- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?</i>

676
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,578
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

677
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,083
<i>- What level are you on, man?
- Six.</i>

678
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,592
<i>Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!</i>

679
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,036
<i>Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?</i>

680
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,971
Yeah. Get low.

681
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:22,244
<i>- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.</i>

682
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,177
Hey. I need a moment.

683
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,513
- Please.
- Sorry.

684
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,676
<i>Hey, man, save my game.</i>

685
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,651
How classified?

686
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,050
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

687
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,294
Yes! One quick peek.

688
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:42,259
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

689
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,891
<i>- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.</i>

690
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,560
<i>The rangers are en route
with the imager,</i>

691
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,570
but we also have a security issue.

692
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,936
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

693
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,702
of the network intrusion signal.

694
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:59,011
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

695
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,448
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

696
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,110
in less than a minute.

697
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,415
- No way.
- Yeah.

698
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:11,327
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

699
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,025
"Project Iceman"?

700
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,537
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

701
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,406
Are you playing
those video games again?

702
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,601
Cops! Cops!

703
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,408
FBI! Clear right!

704
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,344
Lock it down! Lock it down!

705
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,021
Cops!

706
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,448
Lock it down.

707
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,048
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

708
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,722
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

709
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,458
Especially police!

710
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,831
<i>It was an awesome spectacle here
an hour ago</i>

711
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,804
<i>when over 40 C-17 s lifted off
of this very base.</i>

712
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,466
<i>We're not told where they're going.</i>

713
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:00,565
<i>Morning, Mo.</i>

714
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,975
<i>The government has been very quiet
about what's going on but in our...</i>

715
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,707
<i>- Mojo. Mojo.
- They were headed directly</i>

716
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,339
<i>towards North Korea.</i>

717
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,317
<i>Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?</i>

718
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,686
<i>Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.</i>

719
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,817
<i>- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?</i>

720
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,829
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

721
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,729
Stop!

722
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,569
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

723
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,207
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

724
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,017
Sam?

725
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,088
Hi.

726
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,654
That was... That was really awesome.

727
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,852
<i>- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?</i>

728
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,952
<i>I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.</i>

729
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,928
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

730
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,262
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

731
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,725
<i>Oh, great. Cops.</i>

732
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,034
Officer!

733
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,439
Listen!

734
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,947
<i>Oh, that hurt.</i>

735
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,173
Listen to me!

736
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,152
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

737
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,917
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

738
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,619
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

739
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:04,190
<i>So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!</i>

740
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:08,994
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

741
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:14,175
<i>Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!</i>

742
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,112
<i>Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?</i>

743
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:24,852
Okay.

744
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,861
<i>Oh, God, no! No!</i>

745
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:39,235
<i>Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!</i>

746
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,035
It's a bad dream.

747
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,672
Are you username LadiesMan217?

748
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,938
I don't know what you're talking about!

749
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,412
Are you username LadiesMan217?

750
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,641
Yeah.

751
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,183
Where is eBay item 21153?

752
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,980
Where are the glasses?

753
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,827
Get back!

754
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,701
Stop!

755
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:15,805
God!

756
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,469
<i>What is your problem, Sam?</i>

757
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,566
<i>Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!</i>

758
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:25,114
<i>Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.</i>

759
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,813
<i>Sam, what is that thing?</i>

760
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,289
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

761
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,485
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

762
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,963
<i>Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.</i>

763
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,908
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

764
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,313
<i>Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!</i>

765
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,976
<i>No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.</i>

766
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,384
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!</i>

767
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,421
<i>Oh, my God! No!</i>

768
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,821
We're gonna die!

769
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,230
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

770
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,776
We're locked in.

771
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,723
<i>The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?</i>

772
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,722
Okay.

773
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,765
Time to start.

774
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,428
<i>He's got me! Oh, God!</i>

775
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,838
He's going to kill me!

776
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,639
<i>No. No, no, no!</i>

777
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,421
Get off!

778
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,100
Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,769
<i>Get it, get it, get it, get it!</i>

780
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,587
<i>Not so tough without a head, are you?</i>

781
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,993
<i>Here, come on.</i>

782
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,310
What is it?

783
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,146
It's a robot.

784
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,846
But like a...

785
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,476
<i>Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.</i>

786
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,288
It's probably Japanese.

787
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,790
<i>Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.</i>

788
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,089
What are you doing?

789
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,893
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

790
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,298
<i>Really? Well, do you speak robot?</i>

791
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,803
<i>Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.</i>

792
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,337
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

793
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,935
<i>Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.</i>

794
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,578
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

795
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,245
<i>- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...</i>

796
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,914
<i>Digital cable brings you...
... Columbia Broadcasting System...</i>

797
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,786
So you... You talk through the radio?

798
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,792
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.</i>

799
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,885
<i>So, what was that last night?
What was that?</i>

800
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,463
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain...</i>

801
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,624
<i>Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...</i>

802
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,702
<i>Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!</i>

803
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,929
Visitors from heaven? What...

804
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,165
<i>What are you,
like, an alien or something?</i>

805
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,470
<i>Any more questions you want to ask?</i>

806
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,310
He wants us to get in the car.

807
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,819
And go where?

808
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,584
<i>Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,</i>

809
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,783
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

810
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,985
This car's a pretty good driver.

811
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,251
I know.

812
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,896
<i>Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?</i>

813
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,191
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

814
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,357
Yeah.

815
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,269
You're right.

816
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,774
<i>- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?</i>

817
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,708
<i>Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.</i>

818
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,180
<i>- Yeah, all right.
- Right?</i>

819
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,841
- Yeah.
- Okay.

820
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,311
<i>There, see? That's better.</i>

821
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,021
- Okay.
- Okay.

822
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,094
<i>You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.</i>

823
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,132
Thank you.

824
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,328
You know what I don't understand?

825
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,496
<i>Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,</i>

826
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,200
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

827
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,940
Whoa! Whoa!

828
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,809
<i>Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?</i>

829
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:05,972
<i>Move it, you moron!</i>

830
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,107
<i>Great, now... See?</i>

831
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,645
Fantastic.

832
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,618
Now you pissed him off.

833
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,389
That car is sensitive.

834
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,686
<i>I mean, $4000 just drove off.</i>

835
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,931
What?

836
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,069
This is you...

837
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,110
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

838
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,048
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

839
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,157
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

840
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,721
<i>This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!</i>

841
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,061
<i>Fire, fire, fire, fire!</i>

842
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,676
Whoa! Sweet!

843
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,911
<i>Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,</i>

844
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,282
'cause he is so boned!

845
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,523
What is that?

846
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,652
<i>There's something in the tree, dude.</i>

847
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,889
<i>No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!</i>

848
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,329
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

849
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,225
<i>Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?</i>

850
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,838
<i>Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?</i>

851
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,432
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

852
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,168
<i>Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?</i>

853
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,810
They know your name.

854
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,105
They know your name.

855
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,011
Yeah.

856
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,546
My name is Optimus Prime.

857
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:09,709
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

858
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:13,186
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

859
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:18,656
<i>- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.</i>

860
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:22,288
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

861
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,730
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

862
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:28,429
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

863
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,407
<i>My weapons specialist, Ironhide.</i>

864
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,870
<i>- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.</i>

865
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,210
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

866
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,611
<i>Our medical officer, Ratchet.</i>

867
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:47,849
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

868
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,592
<i>You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.</i>

869
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,491
<i>Bumblebee, right?</i>

870
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,293
<i>Check on the rep
Yep, second to none</i>

871
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,766
<i>So you're my guardian, huh?</i>

872
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:05,068
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

873
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,277
Why are you here?

874
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:16,613
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

875
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,386
Mega-what?

876
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:33,561
<i>Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,</i>

877
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:39,472
<i>until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.</i>

878
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,841
<i>All who defied them were destroyed.</i>

879
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:50,044
<i>Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.</i>

880
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:57,016
<i>Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.</i>

881
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,889
My grandfather.

882
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:04,194
<i>It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.</i>

883
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,961
Come back!

884
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,067
I think the dogs have found something.

885
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,907
The ice is cracking!

886
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,315
<i>Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!</i>

887
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,050
<i>I'm all right, lads!</i>

888
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,857
<i>Can we throw you a rope, Captain?</i>

889
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:48,336
<i>Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.</i>

890
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:55,372
Men! We've made a discovery!

891
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,887
<i>He accidentally activated
his navigation system.</i>

892
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:19,305
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

893
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,433
How'd you know about his glasses?

894
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,774
- EBay.
- EBay.

895
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:27,042
<i>If the Decepticons find the All Spark,</i>

896
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:32,985
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

897
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:36,490
And the human race
will be extinguished.

898
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:42,053
<i>Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.</i>

899
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,236
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

900
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,610
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

901
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,702
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

902
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,075
Melted right through.

903
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,378
<i>Hey, aren't sabots hot-Ioaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?</i>

904
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,713
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

905
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,015
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

906
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,415
- Heads up!
- Oh!

907
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,821
<i>I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!</i>

908
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,960
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

909
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,397
<i>All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.</i>

910
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,765
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

911
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,337
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

912
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:29,267
You want that piece?

913
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:32,673
<i>Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.</i>

914
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,837
<i>They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.</i>

915
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:38,279
<i>Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.</i>

916
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:40,943
<i>See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.</i>

917
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:43,520
<i>If you don't touch it, you're guilty.</i>

918
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:47,456
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

919
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:48,719
It's me and you.

920
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:51,660
<i>They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.</i>

921
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,736
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

922
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,474
<i>I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,</i>

923
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:12,573
<i>playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.</i>

924
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:13,651
<i>- And then...
- Glen, you freak.</i>

925
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:15,982
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

926
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:20,786
<i>I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.</i>

927
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:21,859
<i>Okay, so what?</i>

928
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,053
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

929
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:25,857
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

930
01:08:25,964 --> 01:08:26,931
<i>- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!</i>

931
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:30,866
<i>No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!</i>

932
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,264
<i>- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.</i>

933
01:08:35,373 --> 01:08:36,965
See? So can I go home now?

934
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,305
<i>- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.</i>

935
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:43,108
<i>Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?</i>

936
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:45,547
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

937
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,245
<i>and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.</i>

938
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,083
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

939
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:53,487
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

940
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,425
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...</i>

941
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:58,120
- What did he say?
- What?

942
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,697
<i>- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.</i>

943
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:02,358
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

944
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:03,866
<i>- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.</i>

945
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:11,072
<i>Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...</i>

946
01:09:11,176 --> 01:09:12,370
<i>- Yeah!
- Call Sam.</i>

947
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:14,035
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

948
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:15,442
<i>Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.</i>

949
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:18,072
<i>If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.</i>

950
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:19,810
<i>Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?</i>

951
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,523
<i>I need you to stay here, all right?</i>

952
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,785
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

953
01:09:27,893 --> 01:09:28,860
<i>- Okay, okay.
- All of them.</i>

954
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,949
<i>- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.</i>

955
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:31,028
<i>Five minutes, all right?</i>

956
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,699
<i>- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!</i>

957
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,767
<i>The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.</i>

958
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:38,495
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

959
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:40,901
<i>- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.</i>

960
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:44,669
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

961
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:46,334
<i>- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?</i>

962
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:49,311
<i>Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.</i>

963
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:51,974
<i>It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.</i>

964
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,175
<i>No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.</i>

965
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:54,752
<i>No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.</i>

966
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:56,320
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

967
01:09:56,421 --> 01:09:57,786
<i>- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...</i>

968
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,117
<i>No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.</i>

969
01:09:59,224 --> 01:10:01,124
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

970
01:10:01,226 --> 01:10:05,094
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

971
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:07,562
<i>- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.</i>

972
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,633
The...

973
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:13,070
<i>I love you. God, I love you</i>

974
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,900
just so much right now.

975
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,439
<i>You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.</i>

976
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,065
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

977
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,007
<i>Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,</i>

978
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:21,476
because you're such a swell guy.

979
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,706
<i>One more thing, huh?</i>

980
01:10:22,814 --> 01:10:25,874
<i>All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!</i>

981
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,078
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

982
01:10:28,219 --> 01:10:31,484
<i>No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.</i>

983
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,457
<i>No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!</i>

984
01:10:34,559 --> 01:10:36,993
<i>- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...</i>

985
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:39,063
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

986
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:41,997
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

987
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:47,261
<i>- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?</i>

988
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,365
<i>- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!</i>

989
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:55,043
<i>Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!</i>

990
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:58,172
<i>- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!</i>

991
01:10:58,283 --> 01:11:01,047
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

992
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:03,950
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

993
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:07,024
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

994
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,319
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

995
01:11:08,426 --> 01:11:10,587
<i>No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.</i>

996
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:13,892
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

997
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:16,695
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

998
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:22,367
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

999
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:23,964
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

1000
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,633
That's all it is.

1001
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,542
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1002
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,946
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

1003
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,778
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1004
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,547
<i>Autobots, recon.</i>

1005
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:44,087
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1006
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,958
Got some ice on his nose.

1007
01:11:46,064 --> 01:11:48,498
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1008
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,965
You did not.

1009
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:53,363
<i>- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.</i>

1010
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,665
<i>Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.</i>

1011
01:11:58,743 --> 01:12:00,370
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

1012
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:08,277
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1013
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:10,980
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1014
01:12:11,089 --> 01:12:12,750
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1015
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,848
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1016
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:18,218
<i>- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?</i>

1017
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:19,353
My glasses were in the bag.

1018
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,295
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1019
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:22,957
<i>Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?</i>

1020
01:12:23,068 --> 01:12:24,126
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1021
01:12:24,235 --> 01:12:26,430
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1022
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:29,473
<i>Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.</i>

1023
01:12:29,574 --> 01:12:32,008
<i>Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...</i>

1024
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,543
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1025
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:34,612
<i>- You just told me to look...
- I know,</i>

1026
01:12:34,713 --> 01:12:36,078
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1027
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:38,877
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1028
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:40,917
I'm already stressed out enough.

1029
01:12:41,019 --> 01:12:42,509
Okay. What now?

1030
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:48,359
<i>No. No, no. No, no, no.</i>

1031
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:52,419
<i>This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.</i>

1032
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,519
<i>Oh, God. Oh!</i>

1033
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:57,761
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.</i>

1034
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:00,167
<i>My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

1035
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:03,368
<i>Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.</i>

1036
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:06,410
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1037
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,103
<i>What? Oh, no, no, no.</i>

1038
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:09,271
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1039
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,608
<i>Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.</i>

1040
01:13:10,715 --> 01:13:12,706
<i>If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.</i>

1041
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:14,284
<i>My mother's got a temper, okay?</i>

1042
01:13:14,385 --> 01:13:15,943
We must have the glasses.

1043
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:17,612
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1044
01:13:17,722 --> 01:13:19,952
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1045
01:13:20,058 --> 01:13:21,150
Keep searching.

1046
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:22,920
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1047
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,255
Ten minutes. Okay?

1048
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:26,125
<i>Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.</i>

1049
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:28,222
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1050
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:29,357
<i>Calm down, calm down.</i>

1051
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:31,162
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1052
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:33,931
<i>- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.</i>

1053
01:13:34,038 --> 01:13:35,903
Good? Good? Okay.

1054
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:37,167
- Move!
- Get away!

1055
01:13:37,275 --> 01:13:38,970
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1056
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:40,977
He wants us to be quiet.

1057
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:48,616
<i>Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!</i>

1058
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,420
<i>Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!</i>

1059
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,583
<i>Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!</i>

1060
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,521
How did you get over there so fast?

1061
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:57,356
Wow! That was tingly!

1062
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:00,863
<i>- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.</i>

1063
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:07,728
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1064
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:12,837
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1065
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:14,962
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1066
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:16,797
<i>- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.</i>

1067
01:14:16,903 --> 01:14:19,463
<i>- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.</i>

1068
01:14:19,573 --> 01:14:20,631
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1069
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:22,641
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1070
01:14:22,743 --> 01:14:23,903
<i>- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?</i>

1071
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,068
How come the door's locked?

1072
01:14:25,178 --> 01:14:28,807
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1073
01:14:28,915 --> 01:14:30,109
You know he'll start counting

1074
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:31,616
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1075
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:32,707
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1076
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:34,548
<i>- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!</i>

1077
01:14:34,688 --> 01:14:36,053
<i>- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.</i>

1078
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:37,123
<i>- Oh, my.
- Two.</i>

1079
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:39,283
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1080
01:14:39,793 --> 01:14:43,456
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1081
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,555
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1082
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:48,258
<i>I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.</i>

1083
01:14:48,368 --> 01:14:50,598
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1084
01:14:50,704 --> 01:14:52,569
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1085
01:14:52,672 --> 01:14:54,469
<i>No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!</i>

1086
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:56,064
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1087
01:14:56,176 --> 01:14:57,438
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1088
01:14:57,544 --> 01:14:59,569
<i>Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.</i>

1089
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,044
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1090
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:02,170
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1091
01:15:02,282 --> 01:15:03,647
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1092
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,217
<i>- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.</i>

1093
01:15:05,318 --> 01:15:06,751
<i>This is repression,
what you're doing here.</i>

1094
01:15:06,853 --> 01:15:09,219
<i>- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!</i>

1095
01:15:09,322 --> 01:15:13,782
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1096
01:15:15,662 --> 01:15:16,720
- Judy.
- Was I...

1097
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:17,797
<i>- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?</i>

1098
01:15:17,898 --> 01:15:19,229
<i>- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!</i>

1099
01:15:19,332 --> 01:15:20,356
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1100
01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:21,991
<i>- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.</i>

1101
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:24,935
<i>I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.</i>

1102
01:15:25,038 --> 01:15:28,667
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1103
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:30,766
<i>- Happy time?
...my special alone time...</i>

1104
01:15:30,877 --> 01:15:31,844
- Stop.
- Mom.

1105
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:32,934
<i>- Judy, stop.
...with myself.</i>

1106
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:34,070
<i>- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.</i>

1107
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:36,479
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1108
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,608
<i>- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.</i>

1109
01:15:38,718 --> 01:15:40,481
<i>Oh, parents.</i>

1110
01:15:41,388 --> 01:15:44,186
<i>I don't know where it was, but we saw it.</i>

1111
01:15:45,325 --> 01:15:48,886
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1112
01:15:48,995 --> 01:15:51,264
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1113
01:15:51,264 --> 01:15:51,628
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1114
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:52,720
<i>Oh, I hate these.</i>

1115
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,095
<i>- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.</i>

1116
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:55,225
<i>- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?</i>

1117
01:15:55,335 --> 01:15:56,859
<i>- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.</i>

1118
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,301
Can't you take safety seriously?

1119
01:15:58,405 --> 01:16:01,670
<i>- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.</i>

1120
01:16:01,775 --> 01:16:04,676
<i>Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.</i>

1121
01:16:09,783 --> 01:16:13,275
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1122
01:16:13,386 --> 01:16:15,877
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1123
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:18,219
<i>Oh, man. Yard's a waste.</i>

1124
01:16:18,325 --> 01:16:20,020
Trashed. Gone.

1125
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:21,794
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1126
01:16:21,895 --> 01:16:23,920
The parents are very irritating.

1127
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:25,725
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?</i>

1128
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:28,562
<i>Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.</i>

1129
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:29,862
What is with you?

1130
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:33,303
<i>Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.</i>

1131
01:16:33,406 --> 01:16:35,067
<i>We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.</i>

1132
01:16:35,175 --> 01:16:37,575
<i>- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...</i>

1133
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:39,474
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1134
01:16:40,247 --> 01:16:42,511
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1135
01:16:43,984 --> 01:16:46,714
<i>Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?</i>

1136
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,687
<i>- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.</i>

1137
01:16:49,789 --> 01:16:52,849
<i>Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...</i>

1138
01:16:52,959 --> 01:16:54,449
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1139
01:16:54,561 --> 01:16:55,721
<i>- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.</i>

1140
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:16,412
<i>Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.</i>

1141
01:17:16,516 --> 01:17:18,507
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1142
01:17:18,618 --> 01:17:19,585
I want you to distract my parents

1143
01:17:19,686 --> 01:17:21,984
<i>while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?</i>

1144
01:17:27,928 --> 01:17:30,488
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1145
01:17:30,597 --> 01:17:32,622
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1146
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,859
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1147
01:17:34,968 --> 01:17:37,493
<i>Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?</i>

1148
01:17:37,604 --> 01:17:38,730
It's Witwicky.

1149
01:17:38,838 --> 01:17:42,069
<i>May I enter the premises, sir?</i>

1150
01:17:42,175 --> 01:17:45,110
<i>Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.</i>

1151
01:17:45,211 --> 01:17:46,178
What the heck is going on here?

1152
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:48,406
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1153
01:17:48,515 --> 01:17:50,779
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1154
01:17:50,884 --> 01:17:52,317
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1155
01:17:52,419 --> 01:17:53,477
That's right. National security.

1156
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:55,179
<i>My God, Ron, they're everywhere.</i>

1157
01:17:55,288 --> 01:17:57,654
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1158
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,554
Could you stay off the grass?

1159
01:17:59,659 --> 01:18:01,092
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1160
01:18:01,194 --> 01:18:02,821
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1161
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:06,160
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1162
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:07,733
<i>- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...</i>

1163
01:18:07,834 --> 01:18:09,165
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1164
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:10,600
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1165
01:18:10,704 --> 01:18:12,865
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1166
01:18:12,973 --> 01:18:15,999
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1167
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:18,168
- No!
- What is this?

1168
01:18:18,278 --> 01:18:21,008
<i>How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?</i>

1169
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,581
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.</i>

1170
01:18:22,682 --> 01:18:23,910
<i>Whoa, way out of line.</i>

1171
01:18:24,017 --> 01:18:28,044
<i>Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.</i>

1172
01:18:28,154 --> 01:18:30,054
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1173
01:18:30,156 --> 01:18:31,214
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1174
01:18:31,324 --> 01:18:32,518
<i>No, but I'm gonna call the cops</i>

1175
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:34,821
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1176
01:18:34,928 --> 01:18:37,624
<i>Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,</i>

1177
01:18:37,731 --> 01:18:41,690
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1178
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:44,031
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1179
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,697
I think direct contact.

1180
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:53,703
- Son?
- Yeah.

1181
01:18:54,781 --> 01:18:57,682
<i>- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?</i>

1182
01:19:03,456 --> 01:19:04,923
Fourteen rads.

1183
01:19:06,526 --> 01:19:07,993
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1184
01:19:08,728 --> 01:19:10,628
<i>If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!</i>

1185
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,425
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1186
01:19:12,532 --> 01:19:14,056
<i>Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!</i>

1187
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,032
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1188
01:19:20,306 --> 01:19:21,466
<i>So,</i>

1189
01:19:22,909 --> 01:19:26,367
LadiesMan217.

1190
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:29,915
<i>That is your eBay username, right?</i>

1191
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:32,348
<i>Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.</i>

1192
01:19:32,452 --> 01:19:33,419
What do you make of this?

1193
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,080
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...</i>

1194
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:37,315
Is that you?

1195
01:19:37,424 --> 01:19:39,619
<i>Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.</i>

1196
01:19:39,726 --> 01:19:44,561
<i>Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.</i>

1197
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:48,231
<i>- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?</i>

1198
01:19:48,334 --> 01:19:52,794
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1199
01:19:52,906 --> 01:19:55,033
<i>- Really?
...from me, from my home,</i>

1200
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:58,110
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1201
01:19:58,211 --> 01:19:59,940
<i>- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.</i>

1202
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:03,482
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1203
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:08,211
That's funny. That is so funny.

1204
01:20:08,321 --> 01:20:10,812
<i>So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?</i>

1205
01:20:11,991 --> 01:20:14,755
<i>Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T? No.</i>

1206
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:16,351
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1207
01:20:16,463 --> 01:20:17,589
You see this?

1208
01:20:17,697 --> 01:20:20,291
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1209
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,164
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1210
01:20:23,269 --> 01:20:24,497
<i>Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.</i>

1211
01:20:24,604 --> 01:20:27,004
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1212
01:20:27,107 --> 01:20:30,167
<i>You, in the training bra, do not test me.</i>

1213
01:20:30,276 --> 01:20:32,369
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1214
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:33,878
What? Parole?

1215
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:37,313
<i>- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?</i>

1216
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:39,408
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1217
01:20:39,519 --> 01:20:41,248
<i>Well, they... They weren't always his.</i>

1218
01:20:41,354 --> 01:20:42,446
You stole cars?

1219
01:20:42,555 --> 01:20:44,250
<i>Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,</i>

1220
01:20:44,357 --> 01:20:46,154
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1221
01:20:46,259 --> 01:20:48,557
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1222
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:51,289
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1223
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:57,062
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1224
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:59,468
It is time to talk!

1225
01:21:06,212 --> 01:21:07,645
Big! It's big!

1226
01:21:12,385 --> 01:21:14,353
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

1227
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:17,416
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1228
01:21:17,524 --> 01:21:18,957
All right! All right!

1229
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,838
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1230
01:21:35,942 --> 01:21:42,472
<i>Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.</i>

1231
01:21:44,717 --> 01:21:48,483
Taking the children was a bad move.

1232
01:21:48,588 --> 01:21:51,989
<i>Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.</i>

1233
01:21:55,595 --> 01:21:57,324
Freeze!

1234
01:21:57,964 --> 01:21:59,363
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1235
01:21:59,465 --> 01:22:00,523
Whoa!

1236
01:22:01,968 --> 01:22:03,026
Whoa!

1237
01:22:13,813 --> 01:22:15,144
<i>Hi, there.</i>

1238
01:22:15,448 --> 01:22:20,181
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1239
01:22:20,887 --> 01:22:25,824
<i>Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?</i>

1240
01:22:26,426 --> 01:22:27,723
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1241
01:22:27,827 --> 01:22:30,057
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1242
01:22:30,163 --> 01:22:32,757
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1243
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:34,525
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1244
01:22:34,634 --> 01:22:36,124
<i>All right, all right. Get out. Hey.</i>

1245
01:22:36,236 --> 01:22:39,603
<i>All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?</i>

1246
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:43,198
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1247
01:22:43,309 --> 01:22:44,833
<i>You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?</i>

1248
01:22:44,944 --> 01:22:45,933
How you doing?

1249
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:47,774
<i>- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?</i>

1250
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:50,042
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1251
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:53,312
<i>Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?</i>

1252
01:22:53,419 --> 01:22:57,185
<i>Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.</i>

1253
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:01,954
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1254
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:05,190
<i>Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?</i>

1255
01:23:05,298 --> 01:23:08,165
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1256
01:23:08,268 --> 01:23:10,759
<i>I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!</i>

1257
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:13,100
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1258
01:23:13,206 --> 01:23:15,197
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1259
01:23:15,308 --> 01:23:17,173
<i>Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.</i>

1260
01:23:17,277 --> 01:23:19,006
<i>Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?</i>

1261
01:23:19,112 --> 01:23:21,945
<i>Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.</i>

1262
01:23:22,048 --> 01:23:25,245
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1263
01:23:30,523 --> 01:23:31,490
Hey!

1264
01:23:31,591 --> 01:23:34,526
<i>Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.</i>

1265
01:23:34,627 --> 01:23:36,686
<i>Get that thing to stop, huh?</i>

1266
01:23:38,031 --> 01:23:41,330
<i>- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?</i>

1267
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:44,130
<i>- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?</i>

1268
01:23:45,371 --> 01:23:47,202
For threatening my dad.

1269
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:56,181
<i>Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.</i>

1270
01:23:57,951 --> 01:23:59,612
You're a criminal.

1271
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:03,084
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1272
01:24:04,557 --> 01:24:07,390
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1273
01:24:07,493 --> 01:24:08,482
All right.

1274
01:24:08,594 --> 01:24:10,687
<i>This is such a felony, what you're doing.</i>

1275
01:24:12,732 --> 01:24:14,632
<i>- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.</i>

1276
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:16,928
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1277
01:24:17,036 --> 01:24:18,298
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1278
01:24:18,404 --> 01:24:22,841
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1279
01:24:29,382 --> 01:24:31,316
Optimus! Incoming!

1280
01:24:39,025 --> 01:24:40,253
Roll out.

1281
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:50,499
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.</i>

1282
01:24:53,373 --> 01:24:56,774
<i>Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.</i>

1283
01:24:56,876 --> 01:24:58,207
Up you get.

1284
01:25:02,915 --> 01:25:04,883
<i>Okay, we're dropping in.</i>

1285
01:25:08,921 --> 01:25:11,515
<i>Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.</i>

1286
01:25:11,624 --> 01:25:13,785
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

1287
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:17,489
<i>That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.</i>

1288
01:25:17,597 --> 01:25:20,862
<i>Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.</i>

1289
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:22,959
<i>I got it. 12:00.</i>

1290
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,473
<i>Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.</i>

1291
01:25:31,444 --> 01:25:33,639
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

1292
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:41,812
<i>Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?</i>

1293
01:25:42,155 --> 01:25:44,316
<i>Okay, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

1294
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:46,882
<i>Okay, we're coming around.</i>

1295
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:11,106
<i>Easy, you two.</i>

1296
01:26:20,493 --> 01:26:23,724
<i>No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!</i>

1297
01:26:24,397 --> 01:26:27,389
<i>Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!</i>

1298
01:26:28,634 --> 01:26:30,693
- Hold on!
- No!

1299
01:26:34,407 --> 01:26:35,635
Sam!

1300
01:26:41,247 --> 01:26:44,375
<i>All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.</i>

1301
01:26:44,484 --> 01:26:45,746
<i>I'm in for the shot.</i>

1302
01:26:45,852 --> 01:26:47,285
Stop! Stop!

1303
01:26:48,488 --> 01:26:50,285
Wait! No!

1304
01:26:53,659 --> 01:26:56,253
<i>- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.</i>

1305
01:26:56,829 --> 01:26:58,023
No!

1306
01:27:14,113 --> 01:27:16,206
No! Stop!

1307
01:27:16,816 --> 01:27:18,113
Stop!

1308
01:27:18,718 --> 01:27:22,154
<i>Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!</i>

1309
01:27:23,156 --> 01:27:24,487
What? Okay.

1310
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:28,520
<i>Look, he's not fighting back!</i>

1311
01:27:29,128 --> 01:27:31,323
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1312
01:27:37,703 --> 01:27:39,261
Stop hurting him!

1313
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:50,376
Don't let him move!

1314
01:27:51,117 --> 01:27:52,675
I got him here!

1315
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:16,933
No!

1316
01:28:20,947 --> 01:28:22,744
Happy to see me again?

1317
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,980
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1318
01:28:32,858 --> 01:28:35,918
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1319
01:28:44,103 --> 01:28:46,367
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1320
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:50,607
<i>Optimus,</i>

1321
01:28:52,945 --> 01:28:55,413
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1322
01:28:55,514 --> 01:28:59,211
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1323
01:28:59,318 --> 01:29:02,116
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1324
01:29:14,133 --> 01:29:16,499
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1325
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:17,728
in the western Pacific.

1326
01:29:17,837 --> 01:29:20,032
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1327
01:29:20,139 --> 01:29:22,903
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1328
01:29:27,246 --> 01:29:30,113
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1329
01:29:30,216 --> 01:29:31,547
of cruise missile range.

1330
01:29:31,651 --> 01:29:35,178
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1331
01:29:35,288 --> 01:29:37,256
<i>- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?</i>

1332
01:29:39,659 --> 01:29:44,722
<i>Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.</i>

1333
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:48,027
<i>Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.</i>

1334
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:53,661
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1335
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,972
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1336
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:02,479
<i>- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!</i>

1337
01:30:02,581 --> 01:30:04,242
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1338
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,784
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1339
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:08,787
<i>What do you mean, "shut us down"?</i>

1340
01:30:08,888 --> 01:30:11,880
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1341
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:13,083
The blackout's global.

1342
01:30:13,192 --> 01:30:16,025
<i>We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.</i>

1343
01:30:16,128 --> 01:30:20,656
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1344
01:30:26,605 --> 01:30:30,905
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1345
01:30:32,912 --> 01:30:35,278
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1346
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:39,909
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1347
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:42,112
you won't understand right away.

1348
01:30:42,221 --> 01:30:45,554
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1349
01:30:45,658 --> 01:30:49,059
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1350
01:30:49,929 --> 01:30:54,025
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1351
01:30:55,134 --> 01:30:59,400
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1352
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:02,272
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1353
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:05,400
This was classified above top secret.

1354
01:31:20,393 --> 01:31:23,021
<i>EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.</i>

1355
01:31:23,129 --> 01:31:25,757
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1356
01:31:27,032 --> 01:31:29,125
This is the image from Mars.

1357
01:31:29,969 --> 01:31:32,733
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1358
01:31:32,838 --> 01:31:34,601
from the base attack.

1359
01:31:35,374 --> 01:31:38,468
<i>We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,</i>

1360
01:31:39,345 --> 01:31:42,109
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1361
01:31:42,515 --> 01:31:45,177
Are we talking about an invasion?

1362
01:31:45,284 --> 01:31:48,378
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1363
01:31:48,487 --> 01:31:51,820
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1364
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:53,653
<i>That's why the virus shut us down,</i>

1365
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:57,058
<i>so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,</i>

1366
01:31:57,163 --> 01:32:01,657
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1367
01:32:05,538 --> 01:32:07,870
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1368
01:32:07,973 --> 01:32:11,374
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1369
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:14,810
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1370
01:32:14,914 --> 01:32:17,883
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1371
01:32:28,093 --> 01:32:31,358
<i>Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!</i>

1372
01:32:31,464 --> 01:32:32,431
Let's go!

1373
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:38,960
She's in here.

1374
01:32:39,338 --> 01:32:40,999
What's going on?

1375
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,371
You're coming with me.

1376
01:32:43,809 --> 01:32:46,505
<i>- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?</i>

1377
01:32:47,513 --> 01:32:48,844
Who's this?

1378
01:32:49,615 --> 01:32:52,709
<i>- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.</i>

1379
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:06,487
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1380
01:33:07,566 --> 01:33:11,832
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1381
01:33:11,937 --> 01:33:12,904
Wow.

1382
01:33:13,572 --> 01:33:14,698
Who knew?

1383
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:33,390
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1384
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:46,933
<i>Please, let this work.</i>

1385
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,240
<i>Fire it up, Optimus.</i>

1386
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:52,700
The code.

1387
01:33:52,811 --> 01:33:58,215
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1388
01:34:00,019 --> 01:34:03,819
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1389
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:06,753
<i>They must know it's here, as well.</i>

1390
01:34:06,859 --> 01:34:08,190
What about Bumblebee?

1391
01:34:08,294 --> 01:34:12,355
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1392
01:34:12,464 --> 01:34:16,457
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1393
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:20,801
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1394
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:23,841
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1395
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:28,611
<i>They're a primitive and violent race.</i>

1396
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,941
Were we so different?

1397
01:34:33,852 --> 01:34:38,221
<i>They're a young species.
They have much to learn.</i>

1398
01:34:38,324 --> 01:34:41,122
<i>But I've seen goodness in them.</i>

1399
01:34:41,226 --> 01:34:45,390
<i>Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.</i>

1400
01:34:45,497 --> 01:34:49,729
<i>You all know there's only one way
to end this war.</i>

1401
01:34:49,835 --> 01:34:52,531
<i>We must destroy the Cube.</i>

1402
01:34:53,339 --> 01:34:57,901
<i>If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.</i>

1403
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,341
That's suicide.

1404
01:34:59,445 --> 01:35:03,245
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1405
01:35:03,349 --> 01:35:07,809
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1406
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,219
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1407
01:35:12,691 --> 01:35:15,387
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1408
01:35:15,494 --> 01:35:19,294
<i>- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!</i>

1409
01:35:31,343 --> 01:35:34,506
Team attention! Present arms!

1410
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:39,412
<i>At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.</i>

1411
01:35:39,518 --> 01:35:41,213
<i>Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?</i>

1412
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,447
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1413
01:35:43,555 --> 01:35:44,817
<i>If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.</i>

1414
01:35:44,923 --> 01:35:48,017
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1415
01:35:49,528 --> 01:35:50,756
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

1416
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,492
<i>I think we got off to a bad start, huh?</i>

1417
01:35:55,034 --> 01:35:56,126
You must be hungry?

1418
01:35:56,235 --> 01:35:58,226
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1419
01:35:58,337 --> 01:35:59,964
Where's my car?

1420
01:36:00,072 --> 01:36:03,633
<i>Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.</i>

1421
01:36:04,143 --> 01:36:05,838
People can die here.

1422
01:36:06,211 --> 01:36:08,907
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1423
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:10,208
Okay.

1424
01:36:10,315 --> 01:36:14,046
<i>But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.</i>

1425
01:36:14,153 --> 01:36:18,852
<i>Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.</i>

1426
01:36:20,492 --> 01:36:23,461
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1427
01:36:23,562 --> 01:36:24,859
Thank you.

1428
01:36:26,331 --> 01:36:28,060
The man's an extortionist.

1429
01:36:29,802 --> 01:36:31,133
<i>All right, here's the situation.</i>

1430
01:36:31,236 --> 01:36:33,636
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1431
01:36:33,739 --> 01:36:34,831
NBEs?

1432
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:38,535
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1433
01:36:38,644 --> 01:36:42,273
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1434
01:36:51,457 --> 01:36:52,024
Dear God. What is this?

1435
01:36:52,024 --> 01:36:53,286
Dear God. What is this?

1436
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:58,125
<i>We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,</i>

1437
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:01,666
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1438
01:37:01,767 --> 01:37:05,760
<i>He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.</i>

1439
01:37:05,871 --> 01:37:09,136
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1440
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:11,641
We call him NBE One.

1441
01:37:11,744 --> 01:37:14,110
<i>Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,</i>

1442
01:37:14,213 --> 01:37:16,613
<i>but, I mean, that's Megatron.</i>

1443
01:37:17,883 --> 01:37:19,714
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1444
01:37:19,818 --> 01:37:23,151
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1445
01:37:23,255 --> 01:37:26,713
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1446
01:37:26,825 --> 01:37:28,258
in the history of mankind.

1447
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,295
<i>Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,</i>

1448
01:37:31,396 --> 01:37:38,234
<i>the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.</i>

1449
01:37:38,337 --> 01:37:42,137
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1450
01:37:42,708 --> 01:37:45,336
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1451
01:37:45,444 --> 01:37:47,810
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1452
01:37:47,913 --> 01:37:51,906
<i>Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.</i>

1453
01:37:52,017 --> 01:37:53,882
<i>Well, you got one now.</i>

1454
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:57,220
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1455
01:37:57,322 --> 01:37:58,846
All Spark? What is that?

1456
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:01,517
<i>Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-Iooking thing.</i>

1457
01:38:01,627 --> 01:38:06,394
<i>Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,</i>

1458
01:38:06,498 --> 01:38:08,932
<i>who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube</i>

1459
01:38:09,034 --> 01:38:12,128
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1460
01:38:12,237 --> 01:38:13,761
That's their plan.

1461
01:38:13,872 --> 01:38:16,272
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1462
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:20,874
<i>You guys know where it is, don't you?</i>

1463
01:38:22,314 --> 01:38:23,440
Follow me.

1464
01:38:27,085 --> 01:38:29,576
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1465
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:42,091
<i>Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.</i>

1466
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:46,630
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1467
01:38:47,472 --> 01:38:51,340
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1468
01:38:51,443 --> 01:38:52,967
as well as NBE One.

1469
01:38:53,078 --> 01:38:55,638
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1470
01:38:55,747 --> 01:38:58,113
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1471
01:38:58,217 --> 01:39:01,550
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1472
01:39:01,653 --> 01:39:05,248
or any alien species on the outside.

1473
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:47,862
<i>Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.</i>

1474
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,991
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1475
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:58,441
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1476
01:40:04,349 --> 01:40:06,010
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

1477
01:40:06,118 --> 01:40:08,143
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1478
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:09,447
<i>Oh, no, man.</i>

1479
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:14,048
<i>Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!</i>

1480
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:17,094
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1481
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:21,656
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1482
01:40:21,767 --> 01:40:23,200
I got a phone.

1483
01:40:26,405 --> 01:40:28,999
Nokias are real nasty.

1484
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:33,544
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1485
01:40:34,346 --> 01:40:36,473
Nokia's from Finland.

1486
01:40:36,581 --> 01:40:41,143
<i>Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.</i>

1487
01:40:43,922 --> 01:40:49,485
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1488
01:41:03,175 --> 01:41:06,474
<i>- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!</i>

1489
01:41:06,578 --> 01:41:10,241
<i>Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?</i>

1490
01:41:21,259 --> 01:41:23,124
He's breaking the box.

1491
01:41:41,113 --> 01:41:42,239
Go! Go! Go!

1492
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:43,439
Move!

1493
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:54,618
<i>Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.</i>

1494
01:41:55,394 --> 01:41:56,725
Banachek. What's going on?

1495
01:41:56,828 --> 01:41:58,659
<i>Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...</i>

1496
01:41:58,764 --> 01:41:59,822
<i>- What?
...and the backup generator</i>

1497
01:41:59,931 --> 01:42:01,899
<i>- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?</i>

1498
01:42:08,306 --> 01:42:10,069
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1499
01:42:10,175 --> 01:42:11,574
I'll bring security to the...

1500
01:42:11,676 --> 01:42:14,201
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1501
01:42:14,312 --> 01:42:15,904
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1502
01:42:16,014 --> 01:42:17,379
Let's go!

1503
01:42:17,482 --> 01:42:19,245
They're popping our generators!

1504
01:42:31,263 --> 01:42:32,628
Megatron melting!

1505
01:42:33,265 --> 01:42:36,325
<i>16502. We're losing pressure.</i>

1506
01:42:36,435 --> 01:42:38,630
Stand by! Set!

1507
01:42:38,737 --> 01:42:40,796
<i>We're losing pressure!</i>

1508
01:42:40,906 --> 01:42:44,342
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!</i>

1509
01:42:49,081 --> 01:42:51,777
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1510
01:42:51,883 --> 01:42:55,876
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1511
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:04,054
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1512
01:43:04,162 --> 01:43:05,186
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1513
01:43:05,297 --> 01:43:07,231
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1514
01:43:07,332 --> 01:43:09,061
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1515
01:43:09,167 --> 01:43:10,429
<i>- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.</i>

1516
01:43:10,535 --> 01:43:11,900
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1517
01:43:12,003 --> 01:43:13,994
<i>I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.</i>

1518
01:43:14,106 --> 01:43:15,835
Take him to his car!

1519
01:43:17,576 --> 01:43:18,770
Drop it.

1520
01:43:20,545 --> 01:43:22,206
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1521
01:43:23,482 --> 01:43:25,473
<i>Drop your weapon, soldier.</i>

1522
01:43:25,984 --> 01:43:27,713
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1523
01:43:27,819 --> 01:43:28,843
<i>You know, we didn't ask to be here.</i>

1524
01:43:28,954 --> 01:43:31,149
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1525
01:43:31,256 --> 01:43:32,416
S-Seven don't exist.

1526
01:43:32,524 --> 01:43:34,287
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1527
01:43:34,392 --> 01:43:37,657
<i>- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.</i>

1528
01:43:40,265 --> 01:43:41,892
<i>- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?</i>

1529
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,061
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1530
01:43:50,575 --> 01:43:52,543
All right. Okay.

1531
01:43:52,644 --> 01:43:57,274
<i>Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.</i>

1532
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:01,981
<i>No, no!</i>

1533
01:44:02,954 --> 01:44:05,616
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1534
01:44:05,724 --> 01:44:09,285
<i>No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!</i>

1535
01:44:10,495 --> 01:44:11,894
Are you okay?

1536
01:44:13,765 --> 01:44:15,858
<i>They didn't hurt you, right?</i>

1537
01:44:24,609 --> 01:44:28,409
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1538
01:44:30,815 --> 01:44:32,908
<i>No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?</i>

1539
01:44:33,018 --> 01:44:35,248
They're not gonna hurt you.

1540
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:38,880
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1541
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:42,255
<i>Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.</i>

1542
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:43,850
<i>Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.</i>

1543
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:09,409
<i>Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.</i>

1544
01:45:29,541 --> 01:45:30,872
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1545
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,079
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

1546
01:45:37,182 --> 01:45:38,581
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

1547
01:45:38,683 --> 01:45:41,709
<i>He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.</i>

1548
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:43,219
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1549
01:45:43,321 --> 01:45:44,618
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1550
01:45:44,723 --> 01:45:46,122
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1551
01:45:46,224 --> 01:45:47,191
Good! Right.

1552
01:45:47,292 --> 01:45:50,022
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1553
01:45:50,128 --> 01:45:52,187
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1554
01:45:52,297 --> 01:45:54,162
<i>- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.</i>

1555
01:45:54,266 --> 01:45:56,860
<i>Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!</i>

1556
01:45:56,968 --> 01:45:58,401
<i>In the alien archive, sir!</i>

1557
01:45:58,503 --> 01:46:00,494
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1558
01:46:00,605 --> 01:46:02,129
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1559
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,674
<i>- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!</i>

1560
01:46:04,776 --> 01:46:06,539
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1561
01:46:06,645 --> 01:46:08,272
<i>When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,</i>

1562
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:10,348
<i>and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?</i>

1563
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:11,972
Affirmative!

1564
01:46:12,083 --> 01:46:15,917
<i>Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.</i>

1565
01:46:16,921 --> 01:46:18,786
Check that backup system!

1566
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:23,054
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1567
01:46:23,161 --> 01:46:24,651
Come on! Get out of here!

1568
01:46:24,763 --> 01:46:26,287
Heads up! Look out!

1569
01:46:27,299 --> 01:46:29,699
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1570
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:33,237
<i>- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!</i>

1571
01:46:42,947 --> 01:46:46,007
I am Megatron!

1572
01:47:04,836 --> 01:47:06,235
<i>- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.</i>

1573
01:47:06,338 --> 01:47:07,327
<i>Well, put the seat belt on.</i>

1574
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:08,599
Pour it on him!

1575
01:47:22,354 --> 01:47:24,345
<i>I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.</i>

1576
01:47:24,456 --> 01:47:26,856
Where is the Cube?

1577
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:29,017
The humans have taken it.

1578
01:47:32,397 --> 01:47:36,265
<i>You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!</i>

1579
01:47:36,701 --> 01:47:38,168
<i>Come on, Mags!</i>

1580
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:40,760
<i>Over here, sir!</i>

1581
01:47:43,108 --> 01:47:45,167
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1582
01:47:45,276 --> 01:47:47,710
<i>Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.</i>

1583
01:47:49,614 --> 01:47:53,072
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1584
01:47:54,119 --> 01:47:55,108
Mikes?

1585
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:56,482
<i>This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.</i>

1586
01:47:56,588 --> 01:47:58,146
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

1587
01:47:58,256 --> 01:47:59,780
Let's find them.

1588
01:47:59,891 --> 01:48:01,358
<i>Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?</i>

1589
01:48:01,459 --> 01:48:03,620
<i>- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.</i>

1590
01:48:03,728 --> 01:48:06,788
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1591
01:48:06,898 --> 01:48:08,195
- Glen?
- Huh?

1592
01:48:08,299 --> 01:48:11,791
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1593
01:48:11,903 --> 01:48:12,892
What good is that?

1594
01:48:13,004 --> 01:48:15,404
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1595
01:48:15,507 --> 01:48:19,068
<i>Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.</i>

1596
01:48:19,177 --> 01:48:21,008
<i>Simmons, I need a screwdriver!</i>

1597
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:34,315
There's Optimus.

1598
01:48:52,277 --> 01:48:53,744
Almost done.

1599
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:57,480
What the hell was that?

1600
01:49:00,552 --> 01:49:02,247
Barricade the door!

1601
01:49:04,989 --> 01:49:07,355
- Get something.
- Watch out!

1602
01:49:07,459 --> 01:49:09,552
<i>Six, five, four, six, three.</i>

1603
01:49:14,232 --> 01:49:16,598
Here! Put some rounds in!

1604
01:49:19,471 --> 01:49:20,904
Master search.

1605
01:49:21,806 --> 01:49:23,797
I got it! We're transmitting!

1606
01:49:23,908 --> 01:49:25,034
Send exactly what I say!

1607
01:49:25,143 --> 01:49:29,273
<i>Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!</i>

1608
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:33,407
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1609
01:49:33,518 --> 01:49:35,042
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1610
01:49:36,754 --> 01:49:37,778
What was that?

1611
01:49:37,889 --> 01:49:40,722
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1612
01:49:42,894 --> 01:49:45,089
<i>Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.</i>

1613
01:50:09,821 --> 01:50:11,789
<i>- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?</i>

1614
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:15,326
<i>It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.</i>

1615
01:50:36,548 --> 01:50:37,537
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1616
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:07,441
<i>Cool, Mom!</i>

1617
01:51:33,338 --> 01:51:35,329
This is so not good.

1618
01:51:53,825 --> 01:51:55,690
He's behind the pillar!

1619
01:52:01,566 --> 01:52:04,660
<i>- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!</i>

1620
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:10,137
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1621
01:52:14,012 --> 01:52:15,980
<i>Sucker, burn!</i>

1622
01:52:21,753 --> 01:52:23,084
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1623
01:52:23,421 --> 01:52:25,446
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1624
01:52:26,658 --> 01:52:28,683
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.</i>

1625
01:52:29,894 --> 01:52:32,158
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

1626
01:52:34,499 --> 01:52:35,966
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

1627
01:52:36,868 --> 01:52:39,029
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

1628
01:52:46,611 --> 01:52:50,172
<i>- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!</i>

1629
01:52:50,281 --> 01:52:52,476
<i>Here, I got shortwave radios.</i>

1630
01:52:53,017 --> 01:52:55,212
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1631
01:52:55,319 --> 01:52:57,617
<i>Well, use them! It's all we got!</i>

1632
01:52:58,022 --> 01:53:01,014
<i>This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.</i>

1633
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:04,060
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1634
01:53:04,162 --> 01:53:06,858
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1635
01:53:07,465 --> 01:53:09,057
F-22 at 12:00.

1636
01:53:09,167 --> 01:53:11,863
<i>All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station</i>

1637
01:53:11,969 --> 01:53:13,834
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1638
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:18,740
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1639
01:53:19,043 --> 01:53:20,670
<i>Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?</i>

1640
01:53:21,946 --> 01:53:23,106
<i>We have you visual.</i>

1641
01:53:24,782 --> 01:53:26,113
<i>Green smoke is the mark.</i>

1642
01:53:26,217 --> 01:53:29,675
<i>Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.</i>

1643
01:53:34,325 --> 01:53:36,293
It's Starscream!

1644
01:53:36,761 --> 01:53:38,422
Please tell me you copy.

1645
01:53:38,763 --> 01:53:41,061
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1646
01:53:44,869 --> 01:53:46,837
<i>No, no, no, no, no! Move!</i>

1647
01:53:46,938 --> 01:53:50,101
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1648
01:53:50,208 --> 01:53:51,436
Incoming!

1649
01:54:16,534 --> 01:54:18,331
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1650
01:54:18,436 --> 01:54:19,903
Clear the area!

1651
01:54:25,710 --> 01:54:27,234
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1652
01:54:28,112 --> 01:54:30,979
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1653
01:54:31,415 --> 01:54:32,746
Your legs.

1654
01:54:34,318 --> 01:54:37,947
<i>Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?</i>

1655
01:54:39,490 --> 01:54:41,924
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1656
01:54:43,494 --> 01:54:44,688
Ratchet!

1657
01:54:46,564 --> 01:54:48,031
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1658
01:54:48,132 --> 01:54:50,066
<i>What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!</i>

1659
01:54:50,168 --> 01:54:52,534
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1660
01:54:52,637 --> 01:54:54,798
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1661
01:54:54,906 --> 01:54:57,704
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1662
01:54:58,976 --> 01:55:00,000
Come on!

1663
01:55:00,111 --> 01:55:02,238
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.</i>

1664
01:55:04,015 --> 01:55:06,142
<i>Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.</i>

1665
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:08,582
<i>November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.</i>

1666
01:55:26,804 --> 01:55:28,237
Move out! Let's go!

1667
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:36,374
Let's go! Move!

1668
01:55:42,987 --> 01:55:44,648
I'm not gonna leave you.

1669
01:56:23,761 --> 01:56:25,786
<i>Come on, Decepticon punk!</i>

1670
01:56:32,103 --> 01:56:33,627
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1671
01:56:46,183 --> 01:56:48,117
Concentrate your fire!

1672
01:56:59,030 --> 01:57:00,224
Come on. Come on.

1673
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,495
Megatron!

1674
01:57:09,206 --> 01:57:12,869
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1675
01:57:17,148 --> 01:57:18,740
Fall back!

1676
01:57:24,755 --> 01:57:26,950
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1677
01:57:27,058 --> 01:57:29,083
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1678
01:57:29,193 --> 01:57:31,457
We need air cover down here now!

1679
01:57:37,468 --> 01:57:38,867
<i>Sam, help me with this.</i>

1680
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:47,374
<i>- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.</i>

1681
01:57:47,478 --> 01:57:49,571
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1682
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,978
No! I want two!

1683
01:57:53,551 --> 01:57:54,950
What's going on?

1684
01:57:56,754 --> 01:57:59,382
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1685
01:58:00,257 --> 01:58:02,521
<i>Oh, these things just don't die.</i>

1686
01:58:06,097 --> 01:58:07,587
<i>Oh, we're so dead.</i>

1687
01:58:07,698 --> 01:58:10,030
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1688
01:58:10,334 --> 01:58:11,323
Where's the Cube?

1689
01:58:11,435 --> 01:58:12,402
- Right there.
- Okay.

1690
01:58:12,503 --> 01:58:13,492
And take that and wrap it around

1691
01:58:13,604 --> 01:58:14,571
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1692
01:58:14,672 --> 01:58:17,334
<i>- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!</i>

1693
01:58:18,776 --> 01:58:20,243
That building.

1694
01:58:24,015 --> 01:58:25,812
- Okay.
- What?

1695
01:58:25,916 --> 01:58:28,885
<i>All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.</i>

1696
01:58:28,986 --> 01:58:31,250
<i>Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.</i>

1697
01:58:31,355 --> 01:58:33,550
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1698
01:58:33,657 --> 01:58:35,591
<i>- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!</i>

1699
01:58:35,693 --> 01:58:40,096
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1700
01:58:40,197 --> 01:58:42,427
<i>Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,</i>

1701
01:58:42,533 --> 01:58:44,592
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1702
01:58:44,735 --> 01:58:46,225
<i>- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.</i>

1703
01:58:46,337 --> 01:58:47,497
<i>- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving</i>

1704
01:58:47,605 --> 01:58:50,301
<i>till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?</i>

1705
01:58:51,776 --> 01:58:52,834
Army Black Hawk requested.

1706
01:58:52,943 --> 01:58:55,468
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1707
01:58:55,579 --> 01:58:58,104
<i>Headed to rooftop marked by flare.</i>

1708
01:58:58,215 --> 01:59:01,309
<i>- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.</i>

1709
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:06,253
<i>- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!</i>

1710
01:59:10,227 --> 01:59:14,357
<i>No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.</i>

1711
01:59:17,601 --> 01:59:20,229
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1712
01:59:20,337 --> 01:59:23,568
<i>- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!</i>

1713
01:59:26,310 --> 01:59:28,403
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1714
01:59:34,852 --> 01:59:36,149
Watch out!

1715
01:59:41,759 --> 01:59:44,785
<i>- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!</i>

1716
01:59:44,895 --> 01:59:46,556
Get out of here now!

1717
02:00:14,425 --> 02:00:15,392
Megatron!

1718
02:00:15,693 --> 02:00:16,660
Prime.

1719
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:44,679
Humans don't deserve to live.

1720
02:00:44,788 --> 02:00:47,450
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1721
02:00:47,892 --> 02:00:50,258
Then you will die with them!

1722
02:00:55,933 --> 02:00:58,333
Join them in extinction!

1723
02:01:17,555 --> 02:01:19,216
<i>Keep moving, Sam!</i>

1724
02:01:20,224 --> 02:01:21,589
Don't stop!

1725
02:01:37,608 --> 02:01:38,597
No!

1726
02:01:53,824 --> 02:01:55,917
<i>Sam, get to the building!</i>

1727
02:02:03,834 --> 02:02:05,961
<i>Give me that Cube, boy!</i>

1728
02:02:18,616 --> 02:02:20,709
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1729
02:02:42,072 --> 02:02:45,530
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1730
02:02:50,848 --> 02:02:53,976
<i>I smell you, boy!</i>

1731
02:03:06,196 --> 02:03:07,356
Maggot!

1732
02:03:26,383 --> 02:03:27,975
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1733
02:03:52,543 --> 02:03:54,374
I'll drive! You shoot!

1734
02:04:15,332 --> 02:04:16,629
This isn't going well!

1735
02:04:16,734 --> 02:04:18,133
Shoot! Shoot!

1736
02:05:03,981 --> 02:05:05,209
Nice shot.

1737
02:05:05,315 --> 02:05:08,773
<i>- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!</i>

1738
02:05:19,263 --> 02:05:20,321
Hey!

1739
02:05:23,801 --> 02:05:27,237
Hey! I'm over here!

1740
02:05:39,583 --> 02:05:41,278
We've got the boy.

1741
02:05:45,889 --> 02:05:47,322
Watch out!

1742
02:05:47,691 --> 02:05:48,885
Missile!

1743
02:05:59,369 --> 02:06:00,802
<i>Hang on, Sam!</i>

1744
02:06:09,546 --> 02:06:10,877
No! No!

1745
02:06:16,587 --> 02:06:21,615
<i>Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?</i>

1746
02:06:35,172 --> 02:06:36,639
Where do I go?

1747
02:06:37,975 --> 02:06:41,934
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1748
02:06:43,247 --> 02:06:44,874
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

1749
02:06:49,052 --> 02:06:51,486
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1750
02:06:51,622 --> 02:06:54,420
<i>Oh, so unwise.</i>

1751
02:07:06,370 --> 02:07:07,860
<i>I got you, boy.</i>

1752
02:07:09,673 --> 02:07:11,470
Hold on to the Cube!

1753
02:07:31,161 --> 02:07:34,028
<i>- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.</i>

1754
02:07:39,036 --> 02:07:40,060
Sam?

1755
02:07:44,341 --> 02:07:47,572
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1756
02:07:48,312 --> 02:07:49,779
<i>No sacrifice,</i>

1757
02:07:51,148 --> 02:07:54,208
<i>- no victory.
- Lf I cannot defeat Megatron,</i>

1758
02:07:54,551 --> 02:07:57,042
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1759
02:07:57,454 --> 02:08:00,651
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1760
02:08:01,124 --> 02:08:02,591
Get behind me.

1761
02:08:04,294 --> 02:08:06,854
<i>It's you and me, Megatron.</i>

1762
02:08:06,964 --> 02:08:09,899
<i>No, it's just me, Prime.</i>

1763
02:08:12,336 --> 02:08:17,467
<i>At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.</i>

1764
02:08:22,879 --> 02:08:27,714
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1765
02:08:46,870 --> 02:08:49,270
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1766
02:08:49,373 --> 02:08:51,841
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1767
02:08:51,942 --> 02:08:52,966
Hey.

1768
02:08:54,177 --> 02:08:56,338
Bring the rain. All right?

1769
02:08:56,747 --> 02:08:58,738
<i>All right, let's kill these things.</i>

1770
02:09:00,717 --> 02:09:02,275
<i>- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.</i>

1771
02:09:02,386 --> 02:09:04,377
Armor's weak under the chest.

1772
02:09:14,464 --> 02:09:16,022
Target marked. Still waiting.

1773
02:09:16,133 --> 02:09:18,158
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

1774
02:09:25,108 --> 02:09:27,201
<i>F-22s, we're still waiting.</i>

1775
02:09:32,449 --> 02:09:33,882
Move out!

1776
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:38,348
Incoming!

1777
02:09:46,897 --> 02:09:48,990
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

1778
02:10:07,651 --> 02:10:09,482
Run! Move!

1779
02:10:16,993 --> 02:10:18,517
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

1780
02:10:22,032 --> 02:10:23,624
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

1781
02:10:23,734 --> 02:10:26,202
<i>- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...</i>

1782
02:10:34,945 --> 02:10:37,106
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

1783
02:10:41,184 --> 02:10:43,277
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

1784
02:10:43,653 --> 02:10:44,950
Take him out!

1785
02:10:59,169 --> 02:11:00,500
Two's down!

1786
02:11:09,946 --> 02:11:11,880
I'll kill you!

1787
02:11:11,982 --> 02:11:14,746
Mine! All Spark!

1788
02:11:15,719 --> 02:11:18,586
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1789
02:11:19,289 --> 02:11:20,313
Sam!

1790
02:11:21,191 --> 02:11:22,385
<i>No, Sam!</i>

1791
02:11:48,218 --> 02:11:49,378
Hold up.

1792
02:11:52,489 --> 02:11:55,458
<i>You left me no choice, brother.</i>

1793
02:12:05,068 --> 02:12:07,935
<i>Sam, I owe you my life.</i>

1794
02:12:09,072 --> 02:12:10,801
We are in your debt.

1795
02:12:30,327 --> 02:12:32,727
<i>Prime, we couldn't save him.</i>

1796
02:12:33,597 --> 02:12:34,894
Jazz.

1797
02:12:38,101 --> 02:12:40,296
We lost a great comrade

1798
02:12:41,638 --> 02:12:43,503
but gained new ones.

1799
02:12:43,773 --> 02:12:46,071
<i>Thank you, all of you.</i>

1800
02:12:46,409 --> 02:12:48,775
You honor us with your bravery.

1801
02:12:49,813 --> 02:12:51,781
<i>Permission to speak, sir?</i>

1802
02:12:52,282 --> 02:12:55,149
<i>Permission granted, old friend.</i>

1803
02:12:55,252 --> 02:12:56,719
You speak now?

1804
02:12:57,654 --> 02:12:59,747
I wish to stay with the boy.

1805
02:13:00,624 --> 02:13:02,455
If that is his choice.

1806
02:13:07,397 --> 02:13:08,421
Yes.

1807
02:13:29,085 --> 02:13:33,818
<i>Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated</i>

1808
02:13:34,357 --> 02:13:37,383
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1809
02:13:38,028 --> 02:13:41,327
<i>The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,</i>

1810
02:13:41,431 --> 02:13:43,524
<i>deepest place on our planet.</i>

1811
02:13:43,767 --> 02:13:47,294
<i>The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,</i>

1812
02:13:47,404 --> 02:13:49,599
<i>would crush and entomb them,</i>

1813
02:13:51,408 --> 02:13:53,137
<i>leaving no evidence.</i>

1814
02:13:59,783 --> 02:14:04,186
<i>With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

1815
02:14:05,922 --> 02:14:08,516
<i>And fate has yielded its reward,</i>

1816
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:12,961
<i>a new world to call home.</i>

1817
02:14:19,235 --> 02:14:23,433
<i>We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,</i>

1818
02:14:23,573 --> 02:14:26,337
<i>but watching over them in secret,</i>

1819
02:14:26,576 --> 02:14:29,136
<i>waiting, protecting.</i>

1820
02:14:30,547 --> 02:14:33,573
<i>I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.</i>

1821
02:14:34,184 --> 02:14:37,176
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

1822
02:14:37,287 --> 02:14:42,224
<i>like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.</i>

1823
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:46,251
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

1824
02:14:46,663 --> 02:14:50,030
<i>and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots</i>

1825
02:14:50,133 --> 02:14:53,125
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

1826
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:55,899
<i>We are here.</i>

1827
02:14:56,473 --> 02:14:58,498
<i>We are waiting.</i>

1828
02:15:17,794 --> 02:15:22,822
<i>Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?</i>

1829
02:15:25,835 --> 02:15:31,330
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1830
02:15:31,941 --> 02:15:33,841
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1831
02:15:34,210 --> 02:15:36,644
<i>They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.</i>

1832
02:15:36,746 --> 02:15:38,407
The government would let us know.

1833
02:15:38,581 --> 02:15:40,173
<i>- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.</i>

1834
02:15:40,283 --> 02:15:42,717
<i>You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,</i>

1835
02:15:42,819 --> 02:15:44,446
because there's no secrets.

1836
02:15:44,554 --> 02:15:46,647
<i>They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."</i>

1837
02:15:56,699 --> 02:15:59,998
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
