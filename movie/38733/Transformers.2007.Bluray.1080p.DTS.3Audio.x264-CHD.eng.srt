1
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,485
<i>Before time began, there was the Cube.</i>

2
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,151
<i>We know not where it comes from,</i>

3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,495
<i>only that it holds the power</i>
<i>to create worlds and fill them with life.</i>

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,094
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

5
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,671
<i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i>

6
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:19,336
<i>but like all great power,</i>
<i>some wanted it for good, others for evil.</i>

7
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,577
<i>And so began the war,</i>

8
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,710
<i>a war that ravaged our planet</i>
<i>until it was consumed by death,</i>

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,953
<i>and the Cube was lost</i>
<i>to the far reaches of space.</i>

10
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,360
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,</i>
<i>hoping to find it and rebuild our home,</i>

11
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>searching every star, every world.</i>

12
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost,</i>
<i>message of a new discovery drew us</i>

13
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,980
<i>to an unknown planet called Earth.</i>

14
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,255
<i>But we were already too late.</i>

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,795
Oh<i>,</i> God<i>,</i> five months of this.

16
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,397
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,534
A plate of mama's alligators <i> Átouff Áe.</i>

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,805
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,076
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house<i>,</i> Fig. I promise.

20
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,482
But Bobby<i>,</i> Bobby<i>,</i> 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,644
I understand.

22
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,521
English<i>,</i> please. English.

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,323
I mean<i>,</i> how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

24
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,625
Why you got to ruin it for me<i>,</i> man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,663
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,798
Hey<i>,</i> you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,638
What about you<i>,</i> Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,780
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,375
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

31
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,454
Shut up!

32
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,375
Hey<i>,</i> I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
Hey<i>,</i> any of y'all grow some balls<i>,</i>
come see me on the court<i>,</i> man.

34
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,570
Hey<i>,</i> hey!

35
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,878
Watch this crossover<i>,</i> baby.

36
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,147
Like Jordan in his prime<i>,</i>
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,149
- Step aside<i>,</i> ladies.
- Oh<i>,</i> man. What?

38
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,521
- Lennox!
- Hey<i>,</i> what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,220
- Water?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,895
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,371
Colonel Sharp<i>,</i> we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator<i>,</i> 10 miles out.

42
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,606
<i>Unidentified aircraft, you are</i>
<i>in restricted US military airspace.</i>

43
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,516
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,453
Raptors one and two<i>,</i> snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,393
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out<i>,</i>
not squawking.

46
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:33,037
Unidentified aircraft<i>,</i> we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,267
If you do not comply<i>,</i>
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,577
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,239
<i>Tail 4500 X-ray.</i>

50
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
Sir<i>,</i> says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,748
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,912
- Check again<i>,</i> then recheck.
- I did<i>,</i> sir.

53
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,990
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,591
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you</i>
<i>to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

55
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,027
- Radar<i>,</i> where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out<i>,</i> sir.

56
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,265
- My wife on?
- Yes<i>,</i> Captain.

57
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,268
- My ladies!
<i>- Look.</i>

58
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,373
Oh<i>,</i> my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,606
<i>Look at those cheeks.</i>
<i>I just wanna chew on them.</i>

60
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,439
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,677
I know that people say that all the time<i>,</i>

62
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,152
but<i>,</i> wow<i>,</i> we made
one good-Iooking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,018
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,717
<i>- She laughed?</i>
- Her first one<i>,</i> yeah.

65
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,761
<i>You sure she didn't just fart?</i>

66
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,659
No<i>,</i> she's a lady.

67
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,255
She doesn't know you yet<i>,</i> but she will.

68
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,670
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,405
<i>Bogie's on the deck.</i>

70
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,642
Whoa<i>,</i> whoa<i>,</i> whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,014
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,682
<i>- Will?</i>
- Sarah?

73
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,191
Hey<i>,</i> Sarah<i>,</i> if you can hear me<i>,</i>
I love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,623
Hey<i>,</i> Sarah<i>,</i> if you can hear me<i>,</i>
I love you and I'll be home soon.

75
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,322
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

76
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,398
MH-53 pilot<i>,</i> power down now.

77
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,765
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

78
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,619
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

79
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,855
My God.

80
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,143
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

81
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,344
Go! Move! Move!

82
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,983
It's going after the files!

83
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,454
Cut the hard lines!

84
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
I need a key! It's locked!

85
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,022
Move! Move!

86
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,735
Here<i>,</i> come here! Come here!

87
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,781
Here<i>,</i> hide in here!

88
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,986
Oh<i>,</i> my God. Okay.

89
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,647
No!

90
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,428
Oh!

91
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,236
What the...

92
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,947
Epps<i>,</i> let's go!

93
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,403
Okay<i>,</i> Mr. Witwicky<i>,</i> you're up.

94
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,140
Sorry<i>,</i> I got a lot of stuff.

95
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,437
Watch.

96
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,545
Okay.

97
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,242
For my family...

98
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,785
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

99
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,056
Okay.

100
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,183
So<i>,</i> for my family genealogy report<i>,</i>

101
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,422
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather<i>,</i>

102
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,766
who was a famous man<i>,</i>
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
Very famous explorer.

104
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:35,796
In fact<i>,</i> he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle<i>,</i> which is a big deal.

105
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:43,104
<i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors</i>
<i>straight into the Arctic Shelf.</i>

106
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
Move faster<i>,</i> men! Move! Chop! Heave!

107
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,723
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave<i>,</i> men!

108
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,656
Heave! No sacrifice<i>,</i> no victory!

109
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,164
We'll get to the Arctic Circle<i>,</i> lads!

110
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,364
So that's the story<i>,</i> right?

111
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,665
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

112
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,603
used by 19th-century seamen.

113
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,910
This here is the quadrant<i>,</i>
which you can get for 80 bucks.

114
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,308
It's all for sale<i>,</i> by the way.

115
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:18,111
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this<i>,</i> which is a bargain.

116
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,683
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

117
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,516
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet<i>,</i> but they've seen many cool things.

118
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,853
Are you going to sell me his liver?

119
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,552
Mr. Witwicky<i>,</i> this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

120
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,753
I don't think your grandfather would be

121
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,090
particularly proud of what you're doing.

122
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,428
I know. I'm sorry. I just<i>,</i> you know<i>,</i>
this is all going towards my car fund.

123
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,592
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

124
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,033
Cold hard cash works<i>,</i> too.

125
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,435
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

126
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,870
- Sam!
- Sorry.

127
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,803
Unfortunately<i>,</i>
my great-great-grandfather<i>,</i>

128
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,744
the genius that he was<i>,</i> wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward<i>,</i>

129
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,008
drawing these strange symbols

130
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,584
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

131
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,346
that he thought he'd discovered.

132
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,287
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

133
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,689
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here<i>,</i> you want? Here<i>,</i> 50. 40? 30?

134
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,125
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry<i>,</i> sorry.

135
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,789
Okay. Pretty good<i>,</i> right?

136
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
I'd say a solid B<i>- .</i>

137
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,826
A B-?

138
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,963
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

139
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,234
- in my classroom.
- No<i>,</i> kids enjoy...

140
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,570
- Look<i>,</i> can you do me a favor?
- What?

141
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,009
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

142
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,670
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

143
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,409
Okay<i>,</i> I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

144
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
And a man's promise to that boy.

145
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,218
He looked at me in the eye.
He said<i>,</i> "Son<i>,</i> I'm gonna buy you a car.

146
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
"But I want you to bring me $2<i>,</i>000
and three As."

147
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,818
Okay? I got the 2<i>,</i>000 and I got two As.

148
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,987
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B<i>- .</i>
Dream gone. Kaput.

149
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,891
Sir<i>,</i> just ask yourself<i>,</i>
what would Jesus do?

150
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,633
Yes! Yes<i>,</i> yes.

151
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,140
So?

152
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,441
A<i>- .</i> It's an A<i>,</i> though.

153
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
Wait<i>,</i> wait<i>,</i> wait. I can't see. It's an A.

154
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,105
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

155
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,110
- I got a little surprise for you<i>,</i> son.
- What kind of...

156
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
Yeah<i>,</i> a little surprise.

157
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,081
No. No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no. Dad!

158
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,547
- Oh<i>,</i> you got to be kidding me.
- See?

159
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,594
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

160
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,959
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah<i>,</i> I think it's funny.

161
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

162
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,297
a Porsche for your first car?

163
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

164
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,199
- Oh<i>,</i> come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

165
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,815
- Manny!
- What?

166
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,377
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

167
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,577
He's having a heat stroke again.

168
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,744
Scaring white folks.

169
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,754
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

170
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,184
Here? No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> what is this?
You said... You said half a car<i>,</i>

171
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,850
not half a piece of crap<i>,</i> Dad.

172
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,326
When I was your age<i>,</i> I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

173
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,897
Okay<i>,</i> let me explain
something to you. Okay?

174
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
- You ever see <i>40-Year-Old Virgin?</i>
- Yeah.

175
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,527
Okay<i>,</i> that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

176
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,399
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

177
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
- No sacrifice<i>,</i> no victory.
- Yeah<i>,</i> no victory. You know<i>,</i> I got it.

178
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,069
- The old Witwicky motto<i>,</i> Dad.
- Right.

179
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,233
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,110
Bobby Bolivia<i>,</i> like the country<i>,</i>
except without the runs.

181
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,306
How can I help you?

182
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,179
Well<i>,</i> my son here<i>,</i>
looking to buy his first car.

183
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,179
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

184
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,657
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B<i>,</i> baby. Uncle Bobby B.

185
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,125
- Sam.
- Sam<i>,</i> let me talk to you.

186
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,090
Sam<i>,</i> your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

187
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
Let me tell you something<i>,</i> son.
A driver don't pick the car.

188
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,232
The car'll pick the driver.

189
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,137
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

190
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,143
Son<i>,</i> I'm a lot of things<i>,</i>
but a liar's not one of them.

191
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,773
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey<i>,</i> Mammy!

192
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,544
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock<i>,</i> I'd bust your head<i>,</i> bitch.

193
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,714
I tell you<i>,</i> man<i>,</i> she deaf<i>,</i> you know?

194
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:52,353
Well<i>,</i> over here<i>,</i> every piece of car
a man might want or need.

195
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,897
This ain't bad.

196
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,226
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,667
It got racing...

198
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,170
Yeah<i>,</i> what's this?
What the heck is this?

199
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,036
I don't know nothing about this car.

200
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,370
- Manny!
- What?

201
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,070
What is this? This car! Check it out!

202
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,670
I don't know<i>,</i> boss! I've never seen it!
That's <i>loco!</i>

203
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,273
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me<i>,</i> Manny!
Find out!

204
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,908
Feels good.

205
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,483
- How much?
- Well<i>,</i>

206
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,453
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle<i>,</i>

207
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,359
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

208
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,525
- Yeah<i>,</i> but the paint's faded.
- Yeah<i>,</i> but it's custom.

209
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
It's custom faded?

210
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,533
Well<i>,</i> this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

211
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,437
- Five grand.
- No<i>,</i> I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

212
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,434
Kid<i>,</i> come on<i>,</i> get out. Get out the car.

213
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

214
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,409
Well<i>,</i> sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

215
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,678
Now<i>,</i> this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

216
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

217
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,615
No<i>,</i> I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

218
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,749
This is a classic engine right here.

219
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,191
I sold a car the other day...

220
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,663
Gee. Holy cow.

221
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,198
- No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no. No worries.
- You all right?

222
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,066
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey<i>,</i> hey<i>,</i> Manny!

223
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,831
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

224
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,066
and come bang this stuff out<i>,</i> baby!

225
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,109
<i>... greater than man...</i>

226
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,304
That one's my favorite<i>,</i>
drove all the way from Alabammy.

227
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,530
$4<i>,</i>000.

228
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,336
Steve.

229
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,345
Hello<i>,</i> Mr. Secretary.

230
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,941
They're so young.

231
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,178
They're the top
subject matter experts<i>,</i> sir.

232
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,550
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

233
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,022
Guys<i>,</i> that's the Secretary of Defense.

234
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,123
I am so underdressed.

235
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,220
Ladies and gentlemen<i>,</i>
the Secretary of Defense.

236
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,761
Please be seated.

237
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,798
I'm John Keller.

238
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,170
Obviously<i>,</i> you're wondering
why you're here<i>,</i> so these are the facts.

239
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,443
<i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i>

240
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,742
<i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations</i>
<i>Base in Qatar was attacked.</i>

241
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,213
So far as we know<i>,</i>
there were no survivors.

242
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,918
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

243
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,149
We're not sure
exactly what they're after<i>,</i>

244
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,693
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault<i>,</i>

245
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,662
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

246
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
Now<i>,</i> no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

247
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,161
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

248
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

249
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,010
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

250
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,587
and intercept further communications<i>,</i>

251
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,486
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

252
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,789
Now<i>,</i> you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

253
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,492
We're on a hair-trigger here<i>,</i> people.

254
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,192
The President has dispatched
battle groups

255
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,464
<i>to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.</i>
<i>This is as real as it's ever gonna get.</i>

256
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,198
<i>Now I'm gonna leave you</i>
<i>to your officer-in-charge.</i>

257
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,207
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

258
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,833
Good luck to us all.

259
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,723
All right<i>,</i> Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

260
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,422
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

261
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,654
Zero bids.

262
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,430
Great. Broke.

263
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,901
Come on<i>,</i> Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

264
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,203
No. Premature.

265
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,638
Good. What's up?

266
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,575
Nothing. You know<i>,</i> just driving my car.
Driving my car.

267
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
It's like clockwork.

268
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,774
All right<i>,</i> I know you get wasted
on these things<i>,</i>

269
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,943
but if you piss in my bed again<i>,</i>
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

270
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

271
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,552
- Ron<i>,</i> this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

272
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,854
This one is wobbly.

273
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,057
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

274
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,291
- Sam...
- What?

275
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
I do not like footprints on my grass.

276
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,264
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

277
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,066
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path<i>,</i> okay?

278
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,300
- It's family grass<i>,</i> Dad.
- Well<i>,</i> when you own your own grass<i>,</i>

279
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,502
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

280
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,704
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

281
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,974
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua<i>,</i> Mom.

282
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,640
That's his bling.

283
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,951
I want you home at 11:00!

284
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,918
- Yeah<i>,</i> all right.
- 11:00!

285
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,148
Please<i>,</i> for the love of God<i>,</i> drive safely.

286
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,485
Seat belt on!

287
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,458
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,569
Well<i>,</i> it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

289
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,973
<i>At this time, we can't confirm</i>
<i>whether there were any survivors.</i>

290
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,484
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

291
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,</i>
<i>at DEFCON Delta,</i>

292
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,647
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

293
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,685
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
that we have not come across before.

295
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
<i>But our prayers are with the families</i>
<i>of the brave men and women...</i>

296
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,226
Honey<i>,</i> Daddy's gonna be okay.

297
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,059
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

298
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,032
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

300
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,906
except in<i>,</i> like<i>,</i> comic book stuff<i>,</i> right?

302
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,311
- Man<i>,</i> I don't know.
- What is that?

303
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,574
My mama<i>,</i> she had the gift<i>,</i> you know?

304
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,653
She saw things. I got the gene<i>,</i> too<i>,</i>

305
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,717
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,019
and get us the hell out of here<i>,</i> huh?

308
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,496
When I took that picture<i>,</i>
I think it saw me.

309
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,464
It looked right at me.

310
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
All right<i>,</i> we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

311
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,007
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

312
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

313
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,538
<i>- I got no communication with aerial.</i>
<i>- Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

314
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,615
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

315
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

316
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,012
All right<i>,</i> let's hit it.

317
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,788
Dude<i>,</i> are you sure
we're invited to this party?

318
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,760
Of course<i>,</i> Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

319
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

320
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,329
Oh<i>,</i> my God<i>,</i> dude<i>,</i> Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird<i>,</i> all right?

321
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,994
- I'm good<i>,</i> right?
- Yeah<i>,</i> you're good.

322
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,071
Okay.

323
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,740
Hey<i>,</i> guys<i>,</i> check it out.

324
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,213
Oh<i>,</i> hi.

325
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,409
Hey<i>,</i> bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

326
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,615
So<i>,</i> what are you guys doing here?

327
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,225
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

329
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,397
- Yeah.
- You know<i>,</i> I thought I recognized you.

330
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,467
You tried out for the football team
last year<i>,</i> right?

331
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,333
Let's go call your mom.

332
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,339
Oh<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

333
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,137
I was researching a book I was writing.

334
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,541
- Oh<i>,</i> yeah?
- Yeah.

335
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,145
No<i>,</i> it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

337
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,483
No<i>,</i> it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

338
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,752
You know<i>,</i> it's got mazes in it and<i>,</i>
you know<i>,</i> little coloring areas<i>,</i>

339
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,419
sections<i>,</i> pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

340
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,222
That's funny.

341
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,024
Okay<i>,</i> okay. You know what? Stop.

342
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,099
Hey<i>,</i> guys<i>,</i> I know of a party.
Let's go<i>,</i> let's head.

343
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,263
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

344
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,967
Just get out of the tree
right now<i>,</i> please.

345
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
What are you doing?

346
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,270
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

347
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,814
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,181
- Hey<i>,</i> how about you let me drive?
- Oh<i>,</i> no. No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no. This is not a toy.

349
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,255
These 22s<i>,</i> I don't want you
grinding them. No.

350
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,348
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,694
God<i>,</i> I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

352
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,299
Okay.

353
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,200
You'll call me.

354
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,509
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

355
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,101
Hey<i>,</i> man<i>,</i> what's wrong
with your radio?

356
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,113
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

357
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,843
She's an evil jock concubine<i>,</i> man.
Let her hitchhike.

358
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
She lives 10 miles from here<i>,</i> okay?
It's my only chance.

359
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,948
You got to be understanding
here<i>,</i> all right?

360
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,453
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

361
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,183
- Did you say<i>,</i> "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

362
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,088
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,524
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

364
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
Bros before hos.

365
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,692
Miles<i>,</i> I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

366
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,786
You can't do this to me.

367
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,991
You got to get out of my car right now.

368
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,274
<i>Who's gonna come around</i>
<i>when you break?</i>

369
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,242
Mikaela! It's Sam.

370
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,368
Witwicky.

371
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,040
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

372
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,115
You sure?

373
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,979
So<i>,</i> listen<i>,</i> I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

374
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,542
I mean<i>,</i> give you a ride home
in my car<i>,</i> to your house.

375
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,783
There you go.

376
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,897
So...

377
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,168
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

378
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,234
You can duck down if you want.
I mean<i>,</i> it won't hurt my feelings.

379
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,367
Oh<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.
I didn't mean here with you.

380
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,710
I just meant here<i>,</i> like<i>,</i> in this situation<i>,</i>
this same situation that I'm always in.

381
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,808
'Cause<i>,</i> I don't know<i>,</i> I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys<i>,</i>

382
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,446
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,117
Big arms?

384
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,857
Well<i>,</i> there's a couple new additions
in the car.

385
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,453
Like<i>,</i> I just put in that light there.

386
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,991
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

387
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
Yeah.

388
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,510
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,443
Oh<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.

390
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,582
Yeah<i>,</i> a long time.

393
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,586
Well<i>,</i> do we have any classes together?

394
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,246
- Yeah<i>,</i> yeah.
- Really? Which?

395
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,848
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

396
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,222
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

397
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,764
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

398
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,526
God<i>,</i> you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

399
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,328
- No<i>,</i> it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

400
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,869
Yeah<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> I mean<i>,</i>
that's understandable.

401
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,870
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no. No. Come on.

402
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,677
Sorry<i>,</i> I'm just working out the kinks.
You know<i>,</i> it's a new car.

403
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,240
<i>When I get that feeling</i>
<i>I want sexual healing</i>

404
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,079
This radio is<i>,</i> like<i>,</i> you know...
It's an old radio<i>,</i> too<i>,</i> so...

405
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,880
<i>Sexual healing</i>

406
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,217
Look<i>,</i> this isn't something that I<i>,</i>
you know...

407
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,292
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look<i>,</i> I wouldn't try this on you.

408
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,792
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,590
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

410
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,028
- No<i>,</i> of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

411
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,463
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,627
I mean<i>,</i> I'm not that friend.
I mean<i>,</i> we... I could be.

413
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,231
<i>I feel good</i>

414
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,738
Just pop the hood.

415
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,370
Stupid. Shut up<i>,</i> shut up<i>,</i> shut up.

416
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,041
Whoa<i>,</i> nice headers.

417
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,705
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

418
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,216
That's pretty impressive<i>,</i> Sam.

419
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,546
Double-pump?

420
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,349
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,119
I like to go faster.

422
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:32,160
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,093
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:40,227
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,774
I could take it all apart<i>,</i> clean it<i>,</i>
put it back together.

426
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,070
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

427
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,166
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

428
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,837
Well<i>,</i> you know<i>,</i>
I don't really broadcast it.

429
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,973
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

430
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,711
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

431
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,686
Yeah<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> I'm cool with<i>,</i> you know<i>,</i>
females working on my engine.

432
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,347
I prefer it<i>,</i> actually.

433
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,323
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh<i>,</i> yeah<i>,</i> yeah<i>,</i> no problem.

434
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,622
- Thanks.
- You know<i>,</i> I was thinking.

435
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,165
You know<i>,</i> if Trent's such a jerk<i>,</i>
why do you hang out with him?

436
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,028
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

437
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,799
Good luck with your car.

438
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,266
All right.

439
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,310
Walking's healthy<i>,</i> right?

440
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,674
Oh<i>,</i> God<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.

441
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,346
Come on<i>,</i> please.
Please<i>,</i> you gotta work for me now.

442
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,284
Don't let her walk away. Come on<i>,</i>
come on<i>,</i> come on. Please<i>,</i> please.

443
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,855
<i>Baby come back</i>
<i>any kind of fool could see</i>

444
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,219
Hey!

445
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,256
<i>There was something</i>
<i>in eve</i>ryt<i>hing about you</i>

446
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,458
<i>Baby come back</i>
<i>you can blame it all on me</i>

447
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,900
Hey!

448
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,167
Wait a second!

449
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,800
<i>I was wrong</i>
<i>and I just can't live without you</i>

450
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,971
There it is.

451
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,450
I had fun.
So<i>,</i> you know<i>,</i> thanks for listening.

452
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,184
- Oh<i>,</i> yeah<i>,</i> yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

453
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,485
I think you're... No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.

454
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,195
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

455
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,135
Okay.

456
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,104
Yeah.

457
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,730
All right<i>,</i> I'll see you at school.

458
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,899
All right.

459
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,281
That's stupid.

460
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,640
That was a stupid line.

461
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,549
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

462
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,321
Oh<i>,</i> God.

463
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,317
Oh<i>,</i> my God. I love my car.

464
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:58,867
Hey<i>,</i> guys<i>,</i> I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

465
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,640
Come on<i>,</i> man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

466
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,513
- Think about it.
- What do you think<i>,</i> kid? Chinese?

467
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,213
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

468
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,722
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight<i>,</i> level three-three-zero.

469
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,885
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.</i>
<i>And when we do,</i>

470
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,190
<i>we'll know just what to do with them.</i>

471
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,893
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,309
<i>Apparently, there are</i>
<i>very few survivors.</i>

473
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,612
Yes<i>,</i> Mr. President?

474
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,655
Yeah<i>,</i> can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs<i>,</i> darling?

475
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,862
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,198
Shoot.

477
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,903
Gross.

478
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,769
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,304
Are you getting this?

480
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,942
I think they're hacking
the network again.

481
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,293
Oh<i>,</i> my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

482
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,233
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

483
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,328
- Yes<i>,</i> you should.
- So I am.

484
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,748
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

485
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,377
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,352
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

487
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,981
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

488
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,289
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,919
Code Red. We have a breach.

490
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,760
Air Force One<i>,</i> someone onboard
has breached the military network.

491
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,631
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

492
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,640
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

493
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,870
- Whatever they want<i>,</i> they are getting it.
- Sir?

494
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,675
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

495
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,774
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,204
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,776
What the...

498
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,650
<i>Shots fired in the underdeck.</i>
<i>Repeat, shots fired.</i>

499
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,586
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

500
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
I want our President in that bunker.

501
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,803
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,007
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,242
Air Force One is on the ground.

504
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,977
Oh<i>,</i> God. No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no!

505
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,376
That's my car!

506
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,152
No!

507
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,383
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.

508
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,026
Dad<i>,</i> call the cops!

509
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,932
Where you going with my car<i>,</i> buddy?
Where you going?

510
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,772
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

511
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,336
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units<i>,</i> the whole squadron.

512
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,246
Bring everyone!
No<i>,</i> don't ask me questions<i>,</i> all right?

513
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,013
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

514
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,211
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

515
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,036
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,075
Whoever finds this<i>,</i> my car is alive<i>,</i>
okay? You saw that?

517
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,906
Since this is my last words on Earth<i>,</i>
I just wanna say<i>,</i> Mom<i>,</i> Dad<i>,</i> I love you<i>,</i>

518
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,378
and if you find <i>Busty Beauties</i>
under my bed<i>,</i> it wasn't mine.

519
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,473
I'm holding it for Miles.
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> wait that...

520
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,212
Okay<i>,</i> that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

521
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,288
I'm sorry. Mojo<i>,</i> I love you.

522
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,094
No! No! No! No!

523
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,004
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

524
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,099
No<i>,</i> you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

525
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,402
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

526
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:55,414
Whoa! Hey<i>,</i> hey<i>,</i> hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

527
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,687
Okay. Please<i>,</i> please don't kill me!

528
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,123
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

529
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,363
Listen<i>,</i> listen<i>,</i> listen.

530
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,796
- Good<i>,</i> you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

531
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,458
- No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

532
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,628
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

533
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,302
Put your head on the hood.

534
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,318
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network<i>,</i>

535
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,949
which is what they tried to do in Qatar<i>,</i>
only this time it worked.

536
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,687
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

537
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,923
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,660
We're not sure what it's going to do<i>,</i>
but it may cripple the system.

539
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,759
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus<i>,</i>

540
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,395
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

541
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,564
It's become the system.

542
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,837
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

543
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,536
The only countries
with this kind of capability

544
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,943
are Russia<i>,</i> North Korea<i>,</i> maybe China.

545
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,983
- I'm sorry<i>,</i> that's not correct.
- Excuse me<i>,</i> young lady.

546
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,314
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,251
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,483
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

549
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,622
- Her team.
- Sir<i>,</i> I was just trying to say<i>,</i>

550
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,356
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

551
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,126
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,963
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,537
Maybe you can explain<i>,</i> then<i>,</i>
how our latest satellite imagery

554
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,970
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

555
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,566
Maybe it's a precaution<i>,</i>
because isn't that what we're doing?

556
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,044
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

557
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,411
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,711
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

559
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,151
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

560
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,746
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,257
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,023
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

563
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,057
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

564
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,498
Now<i>,</i> if you can find proof to back up
your theory<i>,</i>

565
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,093
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,141
on that brain-mouth thing<i>,</i> you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

567
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,050
Look<i>,</i> I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

568
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,318
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

569
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,551
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,786
Okay<i>,</i> chiefie.

571
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,957
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,862
What are you rolling?

573
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,767
- No<i>,</i> I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

575
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,368
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,235
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,973
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know<i>,</i> a Chihuahua. A little...

578
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,213
What was that?

579
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,051
You eyeballing my piece<i>,</i> 50 Cent?

580
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,683
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

581
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,993
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,629
Are you on drugs?

583
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,440
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,449
Hey<i>,</i> heads up!

585
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,180
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

586
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
What the heck was that?

- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,050
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

Yes! One quick peek.

692
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,936
Circle logs indicate one of

of the network intrusion signal.

694
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:59,011
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

695
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,448
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

- No way.
- Yeah.

698
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:11,327
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

699
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,025
"Project Iceman"?

- Who is Captain Witwicky?

701

00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:04,190
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh<i>,</i> God. Okay<i>,</i> okay! Okay<i>,</i> all right!

740
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:08,994
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

741
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:14,175
Okay<i>,</i> look<i>,</i> look<i>,</i> look! Stop<i>,</i> stop!

742
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,112
Please! Okay<i>,</i>
what do you want from me?

743
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:24,852
Okay.

744
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,861
Oh<i>,</i> God<i>,</i> no! No!

745
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:39,235
Oh<i>,</i> shit! Oh<i>,</i> shit<i>,</i> shit<i>,</i> shit!
Oh<i>,</i> God! Oh<i>,</i> shit!

746
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,035
It's a bad dream.

747
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,672
Are you username LadiesMan217?

748
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,938
I don't know what you're talking about!

749
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,412
Are you username LadiesMan217?

750
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,641
Yeah.

751
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,183
Where is eBay item 21153?

752
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,980
Where are the glasses?

753
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,827
Get back!

754
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,701
Stop!

755
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:15,805
God!

756
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,469
What is your problem<i>,</i> Sam?

757
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,566
Okay<i>,</i> there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

758
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:25,114
Here he comes! All right<i>,</i> get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

759
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,813
Sam<i>,</i> what is that thing?

760
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,289
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

761
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,485
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

762
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,963
Get in! Go<i>,</i> go<i>,</i> go<i>,</i> go<i>,</i> go.

763
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,908
Go<i>,</i> go<i>,</i> go<i>,</i> go!

764
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,313
Oh<i>,</i> God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

765
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,976
No<i>,</i> we're not. No<i>,</i> we're not gonna die.

766
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,384
- Oh<i>,</i> my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

767
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,421
Oh<i>,</i> my God! No!

768
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,821
We're gonna die!

769
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,230
Oh<i>,</i> my God!

770
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,776
We're locked in.

771
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,723
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster<i>,</i> right?

772
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,722
Okay.

773
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,765
Time to start.

774
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,428
He's got me! Oh<i>,</i> God!

775
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,838
He's going to kill me!

776
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,639
No. No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no!

777
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,421
Get off!

778
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,100
Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,769
Get it<i>,</i> get it<i>,</i> get it<i>,</i> get it!

780
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,587
Not so tough without a head<i>,</i> are you?

781
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,993
Here<i>,</i> come on.

782
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,310
What is it?

783
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,146
It's a robot.

784
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,846
But like a...

785
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,476
Like a different...
You know<i>,</i> like a super-advanced robot.

786
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,288
It's probably Japanese.

787
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,790
Yeah<i>,</i> it's definitely Japanese.

788
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,089
What are you doing?

789
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,893
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

790
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,298
Really? Well<i>,</i> do you speak robot?

791
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,803
Because they just had<i>,</i> like<i>,</i>
a giant droid death match.

792
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,337
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

793
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,935
Well<i>,</i> 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

794
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,578
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

795
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,245
- Can you talk?
<i>- XM Satellite Radio...</i>

796
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,914
<i>Digital cable brings you...</i>
<i>... Columbia Broadcasting System...</i>

797
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,786
So you... You talk through the radio?

798
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,792
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.</i>
<i>You're wonderful, you're wonderful.</i>

799
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,885
So<i>,</i> what was that last night?
What was that?

800
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,463
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain...</i>

801
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,624
<i>Throughout the inanimate vastness</i>
<i>of space...</i>

802
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,702
<i>Angels will rain down</i>
<i>like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!</i>

803
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,929
Visitors from heaven? What...

804
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,165
What are you<i>,</i>
like<i>,</i> an alien or something?

805
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,470
<i>Any more questions you want to ask?</i>

806
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,310
He wants us to get in the car.

807
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,819
And go where?

808
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,584
Fifty years from now<i>,</i>
when you're looking back at your life<i>,</i>

809
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,783
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

810
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,985
This car's a pretty good driver.

811
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,251
I know.

812
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,896
Why don't you go sit in that seat<i>,</i> there?

813
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,191
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

814
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,357
Yeah.

815
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,269
You're right.

816
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,774
- Well<i>,</i> maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

817
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,708
Well<i>,</i> I have the only seat belt here.
You know<i>,</i> safety first.

818
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,180
- Yeah<i>,</i> all right.
- Right?

819
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,841
- Yeah.
- Okay.

820
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,311
There<i>,</i> see? That's better.

821
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,021
- Okay.
- Okay.

822
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,094
You know<i>,</i> that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

823
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,132
Thank you.

824
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,328
You know what I don't understand?

825
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,496
Why<i>,</i> if he's supposed to be<i>,</i> like<i>,</i>
this super-advanced robot<i>,</i>

826
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,200
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

827
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,940
Whoa! Whoa!

828
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,809
Oh<i>,</i> see? No. Get...
No<i>,</i> that doesn't work. See?

829
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:05,972
Move it<i>,</i> you moron!

830
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,107
Great<i>,</i> now... See?

831
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,645
Fantastic.

832
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,618
Now you pissed him off.

833
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,389
That car is sensitive.

834
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,686
I mean<i>,</i> $4000 just drove off.

835
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,931
What?

836
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,069
This is you...

837
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,110
Oh<i>,</i> my God!

838
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,048
Come on<i>,</i> let's go.

839
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,157
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

840
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,721
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than <i>Armageddon.</i> I swear to God!

841
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,061
Fire<i>,</i> fire<i>,</i> fire<i>,</i> fire!

842
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,676
Whoa! Sweet!

843
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,911
Oh<i>,</i> dude<i>,</i> I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance<i>,</i>

844
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,282
'cause he is so boned!

845
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,523
What is that?

846
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,652
There's something in the tree<i>,</i> dude.

847
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,889
No<i>,</i> there's something
in the thing by the tree!

848
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,329
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

849
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,225
Excuse me<i>,</i> are you the tooth fairy?

850
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,838
Hey<i>,</i> sweetheart<i>,</i> what are you doing
out here by yourself?

851
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,432
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

852
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,168
Are you Samuel James Witwicky<i>,</i>
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

853
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,810
They know your name.

854
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,105
They know your name.

855
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,011
Yeah.

856
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,546
My name is Optimus Prime.

857
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:09,709
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

858
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:13,186
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

859
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:18,656
- What's cracking<i>,</i> little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation<i>,</i> Jazz.

860
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:22,288
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

861
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,730
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

862
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:28,429
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

863
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,407
My weapons specialist<i>,</i> Ironhide.

864
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,870
- You feeling lucky<i>,</i> punk?
- Easy<i>,</i> Ironhide.

865
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,210
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

866
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,611
Our medical officer<i>,</i> Ratchet.

867
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:47,849
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

868
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,592
You already know
your guardian<i>,</i> Bumblebee.

869
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,491
Bumblebee<i>,</i> right?

870
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,293
<i>Check on the rep</i>
<i>Yep, second to none</i>

871
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,766
So you're my guardian<i>,</i> huh?

872
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:05,068
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

873
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,277
Why are you here?

874
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:16,613
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

875
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,386
Mega-what?

876
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:33,561
<i>Our planet was once a powerful empire,</i>
<i>peaceful and just,</i>

877
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:39,472
<i>until we were betrayed by Megatron,</i>
<i>leader of the Decepticons.</i>

878
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,841
<i>All who defied them were destroyed.</i>

879
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:50,044
<i>Our war finally consumed the planet,</i>
<i>and the All Spark was lost to the stars.</i>

880
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:57,016
<i>Megatron followed it to Earth,</i>
<i>where Captain Witwicky found him.</i>

881
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,889
My grandfather.

882
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:04,194
<i>It was an accident</i>
<i>that intertwined our fates.</i>

883
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,961
Come back!

884
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,067
I think the dogs have found something.

885
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,907
The ice is cracking!

886
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,315
Captain! Grab my rope<i>,</i> Captain!

887
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,050
I'm all right<i>,</i> lads!

888
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,857
Can we throw you a rope<i>,</i> Captain?

889
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:48,336
<i>Megatron crash-landed</i>
<i>before he could retrieve the Cube.</i>

890
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:55,372
Men! We've made a discovery!

891
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,887
<i>He accidentally activated</i>
<i>his navigation system.</i>

892
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:19,305
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location</i>
<i>on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

893
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,433
How'd you know about his glasses?

894
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,774
- EBay.
- EBay.

895
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:27,042
If the Decepticons find the All Spark<i>,</i>

896
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:32,985
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

897
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:36,490
And the human race
will be extinguished.

898
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:42,053
Sam Witwicky<i>,</i>
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

899
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,236
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

900
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,610
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

901
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,702
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

902
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,075
Melted right through.

903
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,378
Hey<i>,</i> aren't sabots hot-Ioaded for<i>,</i> like<i>,</i>
a 6<i>,</i>000-degree magnesium burn?

904
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,713
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

905
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,015
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

906
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,415
- Heads up!
- Oh!

907
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,821
I thought you said
that thing was dead<i>,</i> man!

908
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,960
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

909
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,397
All right<i>,</i> get on the horn
with Northern Command.

910
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,765
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

911
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,337
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

912
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:29,267
You want that piece?

913
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:32,673
Okay<i>,</i> Maggie<i>,</i> look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

914
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,837
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop<i>,</i> bad cop.

915
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:38,279
Don't fall for that<i>,</i> all right?
That's why I ate their food.

916
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:40,943
See<i>,</i> they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

917
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:43,520
If you don't touch it<i>,</i> you're guilty.

918
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:47,456
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

919
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:48,719
It's me and you.

920
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:51,660
They walk through that door<i>,</i>
you don't say nothing.

921
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,736
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

922
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,474
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons<i>,</i>

923
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:12,573
playing video games with my cousin<i>,</i>
and she came in there.

924
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:13,651
- And then...
- Glen<i>,</i> you freak.

925
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:15,982
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

926
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:20,786
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey<i>,</i> man<i>,</i> I'm still a virgin.

927
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:21,859
Okay<i>,</i> so what?

928
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,053
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

929
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:25,857
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

930
01:08:25,964 --> 01:08:26,931
- I promise!
- Glen<i>,</i> shut up!

931
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:30,866
No<i>,</i> you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me<i>,</i> criminal!

932
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,264
- Oh<i>,</i> sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

933
01:08:35,373 --> 01:08:36,965
See? So can I go home now?

934
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,305
- Oh<i>,</i> okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

935
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:43,108
Okay<i>,</i> whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file<i>,</i> all right?

936
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:45,547
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

937
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,245
and some government group<i>,</i> right?
Named Sector Seven.

938
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,083
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

939
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:53,487
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

940
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,425
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky</i>
<i>ended up right behind...</i>

941
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:58,120
- What did he say?
- What?

942
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,697
- Did he hear it<i>,</i> too?
- Yeah<i>,</i> Jack heard it<i>,</i> too. Yeah.

943
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:02,358
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

944
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:03,866
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> I think it's a plane.

945
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:11,072
<i>Still no official word as to</i>
<i>what happened. You can see...</i>

946
01:09:11,176 --> 01:09:12,370
<i>- Yeah!</i>
- Call Sam.

947
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:14,035
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

948
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:15,442
Well<i>,</i> I'll call him in 15 minutes.

949
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:18,072
If you wait 15 minutes<i>,</i> he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

950
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:19,810
Well<i>,</i> I can't ground him
if he's not late<i>,</i> can I?

951
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,523
I need you to stay here<i>,</i> all right?

952
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,785
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

953
01:09:27,893 --> 01:09:28,860
- Okay<i>,</i> okay.
- All of them.

954
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,949
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah<i>,</i> okay<i>,</i> okay.

955
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:31,028
Five minutes<i>,</i> all right?

956
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,699
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh<i>,</i> yeah. No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> Dad. Hey!

957
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,767
The... Oh<i>,</i> the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

958
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:38,495
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

959
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:40,901
- You know<i>,</i> I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

960
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:44,669
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

961
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:46,334
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great<i>,</i> huh?

962
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:49,311
Life... Life is fantastic<i>,</i> is how good it is.

963
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:51,974
It's so... Oh<i>,</i> the trash cans. Sorry<i>,</i> Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

964
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,175
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> I don't want you
to strain yourself.

965
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:54,752
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> I won't strain myself<i>,</i> Dad.

966
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:56,320
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

967
01:09:56,421 --> 01:09:57,786
- You sure? I don't mind<i>,</i> I don't...
- I promise...

968
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,117
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> I'm gonna do it.

969
01:09:59,224 --> 01:10:01,124
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

970
01:10:01,226 --> 01:10:05,094
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

971
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:07,562
- Tonight<i>,</i> right now?
- Right now.

972
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,633
The...

973
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:13,070
I love you. God<i>,</i> I love you

974
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,900
just so much right now.

975
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,439
You know<i>,</i>
Mom wanted me to ground you.

976
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,065
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

977
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,007
Oh<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> just another thing
you did for me<i>,</i> Dad<i>,</i>

978
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:21,476
because you're such a swell guy.

979
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,706
One more thing<i>,</i> huh?

980
01:10:22,814 --> 01:10:25,874
All right<i>,</i> I love you!
Sleep good<i>,</i> handsome man!

981
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,078
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

982
01:10:28,219 --> 01:10:31,484
No<i>,</i> watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please<i>,</i> please<i>,</i> please.

983
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,457
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> wait. No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no! Oh<i>,</i> no!

984
01:10:34,559 --> 01:10:36,993
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh<i>,</i> I... You couldn't...

985
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:39,063
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

986
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:41,997
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

987
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:47,261
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay<i>,</i> you know what?

988
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,365
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh<i>,</i> this is bad. No!

989
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:55,043
Mojo<i>,</i> Mojo! Off the robot! God!

990
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:58,172
- Oh<i>,</i> wet.
- No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no! Easy! Easy!

991
01:10:58,283 --> 01:11:01,047
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

992
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:03,950
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

993
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:07,024
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

994
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,319
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

995
01:11:08,426 --> 01:11:10,587
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.
He's not a rodent<i>,</i> he's a Chihuahua.

996
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:13,892
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

997
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:16,695
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

998
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:22,367
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

999
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:23,964
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

1000
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,633
That's all it is.

1001
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,542
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1002
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,946
Okay<i>,</i> okay.

1003
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,778
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1004
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,547
Autobots<i>,</i> recon.

1005
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:44,087
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1006
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,958
Got some ice on his nose.

1007
01:11:46,064 --> 01:11:48,498
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1008
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,965
You did not.

1009
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:53,363
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost<i>,</i> almost.

1010
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,665
Where are they? No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.

1011
01:11:58,743 --> 01:12:00,370
Come on<i>,</i> come on.

1012
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:08,277
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1013
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:10,980
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1014
01:12:11,089 --> 01:12:12,750
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1015
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,848
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1016
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:18,218
- Yeah<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

1017
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:19,353
My glasses were in the bag.

1018
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,295
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1019
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:22,957
Well<i>,</i> they're gonna be pissed<i>,</i>
so what do you wanna do?

1020
01:12:23,068 --> 01:12:24,126
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1021
01:12:24,235 --> 01:12:26,430
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1022
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:29,473
Just give it a clean sweep<i>,</i>
and I'll get the corner here.

1023
01:12:29,574 --> 01:12:32,008
Yeah<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1024
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,543
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1025
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:34,612
- You just told me to look...
- I know<i>,</i>

1026
01:12:34,713 --> 01:12:36,078
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1027
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:38,877
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1028
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:40,917
I'm already stressed out enough.

1029
01:12:41,019 --> 01:12:42,509
Okay. What now?

1030
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:48,359
No. No<i>,</i> no. No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.

1031
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:52,419
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard<i>,</i> not a truck stop.

1032
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,519
Oh<i>,</i> God. Oh!

1033
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:57,761
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed</i>
<i>right here and now it's gone.</i>

1034
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:00,167
<i>My moped's under there, man!</i>
<i>Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

1035
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:03,368
Sam? Sam<i>,</i> Sam<i>,</i> Sam<i>,</i> Sam.

1036
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:06,410
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1037
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,103
What? Oh<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.

1038
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:09,271
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1039
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,608
Okay<i>,</i> listen. You got to listen to me.

1040
01:13:10,715 --> 01:13:12,706
If my parents come out here
and see you<i>,</i> they're gonna freak out.

1041
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:14,284
My mother's got a temper<i>,</i> okay?

1042
01:13:14,385 --> 01:13:15,943
We must have the glasses.

1043
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:17,612
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1044
01:13:17,722 --> 01:13:19,952
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1045
01:13:20,058 --> 01:13:21,150
Keep searching.

1046
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:22,920
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1047
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,255
Ten minutes. Okay?

1048
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:26,125
Please<i>,</i> I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1049
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:28,222
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1050
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:29,357
Calm down<i>,</i> calm down.

1051
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:31,162
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1052
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:33,931
- Autobots<i>,</i> fall back.
- Thank you. Please<i>,</i> for five minutes.

1053
01:13:34,038 --> 01:13:35,903
Good? Good? Okay.

1054
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:37,167
- Move!
- Get away!

1055
01:13:37,275 --> 01:13:38,970
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1056
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:40,977
He wants us to be quiet.

1057
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:48,616
Earthquake! Move<i>,</i> move<i>,</i> move<i>,</i> move<i>,</i>
move! Earthquake!

1058
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,420
Judy! Judy<i>,</i> get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1059
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,583
Judy! Judy<i>,</i> get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1060
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,521
How did you get over there so fast?

1061
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:57,356
Wow! That was tingly!

1062
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:00,863
- You got to try that!
- Yeah<i>,</i> that looks fun.

1063
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:07,728
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1064
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:12,837
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1065
01:14:13,937 --> 01:14:15,666
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1066
01:14:15,806 --> 01:14:17,501
- Sam!
- Ratchet<i>,</i> point the light.

1067
01:14:17,607 --> 01:14:20,167
- Come on<i>,</i> hurry.
- Listen<i>,</i> we got a major issue in here.

1068
01:14:20,277 --> 01:14:21,335
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1069
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:23,345
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1070
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:24,607
- Shut it off.
- Sam<i>,</i> are you in there?

1071
01:14:24,714 --> 01:14:25,772
How come the door's locked?

1072
01:14:25,882 --> 01:14:29,511
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1073
01:14:29,619 --> 01:14:30,813
You know he'll start counting

1074
01:14:30,921 --> 01:14:32,320
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1075
01:14:32,422 --> 01:14:33,411
Oh<i>,</i> dear.

1076
01:14:33,523 --> 01:14:35,252
- Four. It's coming off the hinges<i>,</i> pal.
- He's counting!

1077
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:36,757
- Sam<i>,</i> just open the door.
- Three.

1078
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:37,827
- Oh<i>,</i> my.
- Two.

1079
01:14:37,928 --> 01:14:39,987
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1080
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:44,160
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1081
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:47,259
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1082
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:48,962
I'm a child. You know<i>,</i> I'm a teenager.

1083
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:51,302
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1084
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:53,273
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1085
01:14:53,376 --> 01:14:55,173
No<i>,</i> what light? What?
There's no light<i>,</i> Dad! There's no light!

1086
01:14:55,278 --> 01:14:56,768
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1087
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,142
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1088
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:00,273
Look<i>,</i> you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1089
01:15:00,383 --> 01:15:01,748
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1090
01:15:01,885 --> 01:15:02,874
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1091
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:04,351
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1092
01:15:04,454 --> 01:15:05,921
- You were screaming at me<i>,</i> okay?
- No.

1093
01:15:06,022 --> 01:15:07,455
This is repression<i>,</i>
what you're doing here.

1094
01:15:07,557 --> 01:15:09,923
- You're ruining my youth<i>,</i> okay?
- Oh<i>,</i> for Pete's sakes!

1095
01:15:10,026 --> 01:15:14,486
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1096
01:15:16,366 --> 01:15:17,424
- Judy.
- Was I...

1097
01:15:17,534 --> 01:15:18,501
- No<i>,</i> Mom.
- Zip it<i>,</i> okay?

1098
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:19,933
- It's okay.
- No<i>,</i> I don't masturbate!

1099
01:15:20,036 --> 01:15:21,060
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1100
01:15:21,171 --> 01:15:22,695
- That's a father-and-son thing<i>,</i> okay?
- Father-son thing.

1101
01:15:22,806 --> 01:15:25,639
I mean<i>,</i> you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1102
01:15:25,742 --> 01:15:29,371
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1103
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:31,470
- Happy time?
<i>...</i>my special alone time...

1104
01:15:31,581 --> 01:15:32,548
- Stop.
- Mom.

1105
01:15:32,649 --> 01:15:33,638
- Judy<i>,</i> stop.
<i>...</i>with myself.

1106
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:34,774
- Mom<i>,</i> you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

1107
01:15:34,885 --> 01:15:37,183
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1108
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,312
- No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> Dad.
- Yeah<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> we saw a light.

1109
01:15:39,422 --> 01:15:41,185
Oh<i>,</i> parents.

1110
01:15:42,092 --> 01:15:44,890
I don't know where it was<i>,</i> but we saw it.

1111
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:49,590
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1112
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:51,968
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1113
01:15:51,968 --> 01:15:52,332
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1114
01:15:52,435 --> 01:15:53,424
Oh<i>,</i> I hate these.

1115
01:15:53,537 --> 01:15:54,799
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick<i>,</i> hide.

1116
01:15:54,905 --> 01:15:55,929
- Hey<i>,</i> the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

1117
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:57,563
- Where?
- Come on<i>,</i> get out of that tub.

1118
01:15:57,674 --> 01:15:59,005
Can't you take safety seriously?

1119
01:15:59,109 --> 01:16:02,374
- Good Lord<i>,</i> this floor is filthy<i>,</i> Sam.
- Oh<i>,</i> oh<i>,</i> man! Man. Oh.

1120
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:05,380
Oh<i>,</i> no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1121
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:13,979
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1122
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:16,581
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1123
01:16:16,693 --> 01:16:18,923
Oh<i>,</i> man. Yard's a waste.

1124
01:16:19,029 --> 01:16:20,724
Trashed. Gone.

1125
01:16:21,031 --> 01:16:22,498
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1126
01:16:22,599 --> 01:16:24,624
The parents are very irritating.

1127
01:16:24,734 --> 01:16:26,429
- Yeah<i>,</i> yeah<i>,</i> yeah.
- Can I take them out?

1128
01:16:26,536 --> 01:16:29,266
Ironhide<i>,</i> you know
we don't harm humans.

1129
01:16:29,372 --> 01:16:30,566
What is with you?

1130
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:34,007
Well<i>,</i> I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1131
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:35,771
We heard you talking
to somebody<i>,</i> Sam.

1132
01:16:35,879 --> 01:16:38,279
- We wanna know who.
- Mom<i>,</i> I told...

1133
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:40,178
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1134
01:16:40,951 --> 01:16:43,215
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1135
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:47,418
Gosh<i>,</i> you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1136
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:50,391
- She can hear you talking<i>,</i> Mom.
- Thank you.

1137
01:16:50,493 --> 01:16:53,553
Oh<i>,</i> my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1138
01:16:53,663 --> 01:16:55,153
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1139
01:16:55,265 --> 01:16:56,425
- Come on<i>,</i> hon. Let's go.
- Oh<i>,</i> it's in the kitchen.

1140
01:17:13,783 --> 01:17:17,116
Oh<i>,</i> yes. Okay. Okay.

1141
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:19,211
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1142
01:17:19,322 --> 01:17:20,289
I want you to distract my parents

1143
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:22,688
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them<i>,</i> okay?

1144
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:31,192
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1145
01:17:31,301 --> 01:17:33,326
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1146
01:17:33,436 --> 01:17:35,563
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1147
01:17:35,672 --> 01:17:38,197
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity<i>,</i> is he not?

1148
01:17:38,308 --> 01:17:39,434
It's Witwicky.

1149
01:17:39,542 --> 01:17:42,773
May I enter the premises<i>,</i> sir?

1150
01:17:42,879 --> 01:17:45,814
Ron<i>,</i> there's guys all over the front yard.

1151
01:17:45,915 --> 01:17:46,882
What the heck is going on here?

1152
01:17:46,983 --> 01:17:49,110
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1153
01:17:49,219 --> 01:17:51,483
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1154
01:17:51,588 --> 01:17:53,021
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1155
01:17:53,123 --> 01:17:54,181
That's right. National security.

1156
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:55,883
My God<i>,</i> Ron<i>,</i> they're everywhere.

1157
01:17:55,992 --> 01:17:58,358
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1158
01:17:58,461 --> 01:18:00,258
Could you stay off the grass?

1159
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:01,796
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1160
01:18:01,898 --> 01:18:03,525
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1161
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:06,864
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1162
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:08,437
- Drop the bat<i>,</i> ma'am.
- Hey<i>,</i> hey<i>,</i> hey<i>,</i> that's my...

1163
01:18:08,538 --> 01:18:09,869
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1164
01:18:09,973 --> 01:18:11,304
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1165
01:18:11,408 --> 01:18:13,569
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1166
01:18:13,677 --> 01:18:16,703
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1167
01:18:16,813 --> 01:18:18,872
- No!
- What is this?

1168
01:18:18,982 --> 01:18:21,712
How you doing<i>,</i> son?
Is your name Sam?

1169
01:18:21,818 --> 01:18:23,285
- Yeah.
- Well<i>,</i> I need you to come with us.

1170
01:18:23,386 --> 01:18:24,614
Whoa<i>,</i> way out of line.

1171
01:18:24,721 --> 01:18:28,748
Sir<i>,</i> I am asking politely. Back off.

1172
01:18:28,858 --> 01:18:30,758
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1173
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:31,918
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1174
01:18:32,028 --> 01:18:33,222
No<i>,</i> but I'm gonna call the cops

1175
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:35,525
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1176
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:38,328
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you<i>,</i> your son<i>,</i>

1177
01:18:38,435 --> 01:18:42,394
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1178
01:18:42,505 --> 01:18:44,735
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1179
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:47,401
I think direct contact.

1180
01:18:52,849 --> 01:18:54,407
- Son?
- Yeah.

1181
01:18:55,485 --> 01:18:58,386
- Step forward<i>,</i> please.
- Just stand?

1182
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,627
Fourteen rads.

1183
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:08,697
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1184
01:19:09,432 --> 01:19:11,332
If you hurt my dog<i>,</i> I'll kick your ass!

1185
01:19:11,434 --> 01:19:13,129
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1186
01:19:13,236 --> 01:19:14,760
Sam! Do not say anything<i>,</i> Sam!

1187
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:16,736
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1188
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:22,170
So<i>,</i>

1189
01:19:23,613 --> 01:19:27,071
LadiesMan217.

1190
01:19:27,183 --> 01:19:30,619
That is your eBay username<i>,</i> right?

1191
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,052
Yeah<i>,</i> but<i>,</i> you know<i>,</i>
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1192
01:19:33,156 --> 01:19:34,123
What do you make of this?

1193
01:19:34,224 --> 01:19:36,784
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?</i>
<i>And my...</i>

1194
01:19:36,893 --> 01:19:38,019
Is that you?

1195
01:19:38,128 --> 01:19:40,323
Yeah<i>,</i> that sounds like LadiesMan.

1196
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:45,265
Last night at the station<i>,</i> you told
the officer your car transformed.

1197
01:19:46,603 --> 01:19:48,935
- Enlighten me.
- Well<i>,</i> here's what I said<i>,</i> okay?

1198
01:19:49,038 --> 01:19:53,498
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1199
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:55,737
- Really?
<i>...</i>from me<i>,</i> from my home<i>,</i>

1200
01:19:55,845 --> 01:19:58,814
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1201
01:19:58,915 --> 01:20:00,644
- Well<i>,</i> not by itself.
- Well<i>,</i> no.

1202
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:04,186
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1203
01:20:07,323 --> 01:20:08,915
That's funny. That is so funny.

1204
01:20:09,025 --> 01:20:11,516
So what do you kids know
about aliens<i>,</i> huh?

1205
01:20:12,695 --> 01:20:15,459
Oh<i>,</i> you mean<i>,</i> like a Martian?
Like what<i>, E. T?</i> No.

1206
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:17,055
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1207
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:18,293
You see this?

1208
01:20:18,401 --> 01:20:20,995
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1209
01:20:21,104 --> 01:20:23,868
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1210
01:20:23,973 --> 01:20:25,201
Oh<i>,</i> God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1211
01:20:25,308 --> 01:20:27,708
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1212
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:30,871
You<i>,</i> in the training bra<i>,</i> do not test me.

1213
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:33,073
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1214
01:20:33,183 --> 01:20:34,582
What? Parole?

1215
01:20:34,684 --> 01:20:38,017
- It's nothing.
- Oh<i>,</i> grand theft auto<i>,</i> that ain't nothing?

1216
01:20:38,121 --> 01:20:40,112
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1217
01:20:40,223 --> 01:20:41,952
Well<i>,</i> they... They weren't always his.

1218
01:20:42,058 --> 01:20:43,150
You stole cars?

1219
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:44,954
Well<i>,</i> we couldn't always afford
a babysitter<i>,</i>

1220
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:46,858
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1221
01:20:46,963 --> 01:20:49,261
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1222
01:20:49,365 --> 01:20:51,993
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1223
01:20:53,136 --> 01:20:57,766
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1224
01:20:57,874 --> 01:21:00,172
It is time to talk!

1225
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:08,349
Big! It's big!

1226
01:21:13,089 --> 01:21:15,057
Go<i>,</i> go<i>,</i> go<i>,</i> go!

1227
01:21:15,492 --> 01:21:18,120
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1228
01:21:18,228 --> 01:21:19,661
All right! All right!

1229
01:21:34,244 --> 01:21:36,542
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1230
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:43,176
Gentlemen<i>,</i> I want to introduce you
to my friend<i>,</i> Optimus Prime.

1231
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:49,187
Taking the children was a bad move.

1232
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:52,693
Autobots<i>,</i> relieve them of their weapons.

1233
01:21:56,299 --> 01:21:58,028
Freeze!

1234
01:21:58,668 --> 01:22:00,067
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1235
01:22:00,169 --> 01:22:01,227
Whoa!

1236
01:22:02,672 --> 01:22:03,730
Whoa!

1237
01:22:14,517 --> 01:22:15,848
Hi<i>,</i> there.

1238
01:22:16,152 --> 01:22:20,885
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1239
01:22:21,591 --> 01:22:26,528
Look<i>,</i> there are
S-Seven protocols<i>,</i> okay?

1240
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:28,427
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1241
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:30,761
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1242
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:33,461
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1243
01:22:34,103 --> 01:22:35,229
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1244
01:22:35,338 --> 01:22:36,828
All right<i>,</i> all right. Get out. Hey.

1245
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:40,307
All right<i>,</i> I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1246
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:43,902
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1247
01:22:44,013 --> 01:22:45,537
You're good with handcuffs<i>,</i> too<i>,</i>
now<i>,</i> huh?

1248
01:22:45,648 --> 01:22:46,637
How you doing?

1249
01:22:46,749 --> 01:22:48,478
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going<i>,</i> huh?

1250
01:22:48,585 --> 01:22:50,746
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1251
01:22:50,853 --> 01:22:54,016
Now<i>,</i> listen. If I choose to engage
with him<i>,</i> mum is the word<i>,</i> all right?

1252
01:22:54,123 --> 01:22:57,889
Sam<i>,</i> I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1253
01:22:58,494 --> 01:23:02,658
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1254
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:05,894
Big guys. Big guys with big guns<i>,</i> huh?

1255
01:23:06,002 --> 01:23:08,869
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1256
01:23:08,972 --> 01:23:11,463
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you<i>,</i> young man!

1257
01:23:11,574 --> 01:23:13,804
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1258
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:15,901
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1259
01:23:16,012 --> 01:23:17,877
Hey. You touch me<i>,</i>
that's a federal offense.

1260
01:23:17,981 --> 01:23:19,710
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge<i>,</i> right?

1261
01:23:19,816 --> 01:23:22,649
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden<i>,</i> with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1262
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,949
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1263
01:23:31,227 --> 01:23:32,194
Hey!

1264
01:23:32,295 --> 01:23:35,230
Bumblebee<i>,</i> stop lubricating the man.

1265
01:23:35,331 --> 01:23:37,390
Get that thing to stop<i>,</i> huh?

1266
01:23:38,735 --> 01:23:42,034
- All right<i>,</i> tough guy<i>,</i> take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1267
01:23:42,138 --> 01:23:44,834
- Your clothes<i>,</i> all of it<i>,</i> off.
- For what?

1268
01:23:46,075 --> 01:23:47,906
For threatening my dad.

1269
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:56,885
Little lady<i>,</i> this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1270
01:23:58,655 --> 01:24:00,316
You're a criminal.

1271
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:03,788
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1272
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:08,094
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1273
01:24:08,197 --> 01:24:09,186
All right.

1274
01:24:09,298 --> 01:24:11,391
This is such a felony<i>,</i> what you're doing.

1275
01:24:13,436 --> 01:24:15,336
- I will hunt you down<i>,</i> okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

1276
01:24:15,471 --> 01:24:17,632
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1277
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,002
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1278
01:24:19,108 --> 01:24:23,545
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1279
01:24:30,086 --> 01:24:32,020
Optimus! Incoming!

1280
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:40,957
Roll out.

1281
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:51,203
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rad readings</i>
<i>under that bridge right down there.</i>

1282
01:24:54,077 --> 01:24:57,478
<i>Okay, I'm getting really good rad</i>
<i>readings. Forty-two and higher.</i>

1283
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:58,911
Up you get.

1284
01:25:03,619 --> 01:25:05,587
<i>Okay, we're dropping in.</i>

1285
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:12,219
<i>Really strong readings right down</i>
<i>below us. There he is.</i>

1286
01:25:12,328 --> 01:25:14,489
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

1287
01:25:15,565 --> 01:25:18,193
<i>That's it, right there.</i>
<i>Mark him, mark him.</i>

1288
01:25:18,301 --> 01:25:21,566
<i>Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.</i>
<i>Right off the nose.</i>

1289
01:25:22,105 --> 01:25:23,663
<i>I got it. 12:00.</i>

1290
01:25:27,744 --> 01:25:29,177
<i>Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.</i>

1291
01:25:32,148 --> 01:25:34,343
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

1292
01:25:37,954 --> 01:25:42,516
<i>Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.</i>
<i>Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?</i>

1293
01:25:42,859 --> 01:25:45,020
<i>Okay, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

1294
01:25:45,595 --> 01:25:47,586
<i>Okay, we're coming around.</i>

1295
01:26:10,286 --> 01:26:11,810
Easy<i>,</i> you two.

1296
01:26:21,197 --> 01:26:24,428
No! No! No<i>,</i> Sam! Sam<i>,</i> don't drop me!

1297
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:28,093
Sam<i>,</i> don't! Sam<i>,</i> don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1298
01:26:29,338 --> 01:26:31,397
- Hold on!
- No!

1299
01:26:35,111 --> 01:26:36,339
Sam!

1300
01:26:41,951 --> 01:26:45,079
<i>All right, we've got him pinned.</i>
<i>We've got him pinned in the river.</i>

1301
01:26:45,188 --> 01:26:46,450
<i>I'm in for the shot.</i>

1302
01:26:46,556 --> 01:26:47,989
Stop! Stop!

1303
01:26:49,192 --> 01:26:50,989
Wait! No!

1304
01:26:54,363 --> 01:26:56,957
<i>- Take the shot, get him.</i>
<i>- Take the shot.</i>

1305
01:26:57,533 --> 01:26:58,727
No!

1306
01:27:14,817 --> 01:27:16,910
No! Stop!

1307
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,817
Stop!

1308
01:27:19,422 --> 01:27:22,858
<i>Get down on the ground! Get down!</i>
<i>Get down!</i>

1309
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,191
What? Okay.

1310
01:27:27,063 --> 01:27:29,224
Look<i>,</i> he's not fighting back!

1311
01:27:29,832 --> 01:27:32,027
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1312
01:27:38,407 --> 01:27:39,965
Stop hurting him!

1313
01:27:49,385 --> 01:27:51,080
Don't let him move!

1314
01:27:51,821 --> 01:27:53,379
I got him here!

1315
01:28:16,579 --> 01:28:17,637
No!

1316
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:23,448
Happy to see me again?

1317
01:28:24,954 --> 01:28:27,684
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1318
01:28:33,562 --> 01:28:36,622
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1319
01:28:44,807 --> 01:28:47,071
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1320
01:28:49,912 --> 01:28:51,311
Optimus<i>,</i>

1321
01:28:53,649 --> 01:28:56,117
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1322
01:28:56,218 --> 01:28:59,915
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1323
01:29:00,022 --> 01:29:02,820
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1324
01:29:14,837 --> 01:29:17,203
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1325
01:29:17,306 --> 01:29:18,432
in the western Pacific.

1326
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:20,736
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1327
01:29:20,843 --> 01:29:23,607
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1328
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,817
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1329
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,251
of cruise missile range.

1330
01:29:32,355 --> 01:29:35,882
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1331
01:29:35,992 --> 01:29:37,960
- Yes<i>,</i> sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

1332
01:29:40,363 --> 01:29:45,426
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven<i>,</i>
Advanced Research Division.

1333
01:29:45,534 --> 01:29:48,731
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy<i>,</i> Tom.
I think you can see that.

1334
01:29:51,874 --> 01:29:54,365
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1335
01:29:58,014 --> 01:30:00,676
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1336
01:30:00,783 --> 01:30:03,183
- The whole room's gone down<i>,</i> sir.
- I can see that!

1337
01:30:03,285 --> 01:30:04,946
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1338
01:30:05,054 --> 01:30:07,488
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1339
01:30:08,524 --> 01:30:09,491
What do you mean<i>,</i> "shut us down"?

1340
01:30:09,592 --> 01:30:12,584
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1341
01:30:12,695 --> 01:30:13,787
The blackout's global.

1342
01:30:13,896 --> 01:30:16,729
We have no communications<i>,</i>
satellite and land lines are dead.

1343
01:30:16,832 --> 01:30:21,360
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1344
01:30:27,309 --> 01:30:31,609
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1345
01:30:33,616 --> 01:30:35,982
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1346
01:30:39,055 --> 01:30:40,613
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1347
01:30:40,723 --> 01:30:42,816
you won't understand right away.

1348
01:30:42,925 --> 01:30:46,258
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1349
01:30:46,362 --> 01:30:49,763
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1350
01:30:50,633 --> 01:30:54,729
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1351
01:30:55,838 --> 01:31:00,104
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1352
01:31:00,576 --> 01:31:02,976
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1353
01:31:03,579 --> 01:31:06,104
This was classified above top secret.

1354
01:31:21,097 --> 01:31:23,725
<i>EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.</i>

1355
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:26,461
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1356
01:31:27,736 --> 01:31:29,829
This is the image from Mars.

1357
01:31:30,673 --> 01:31:33,437
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1358
01:31:33,542 --> 01:31:35,305
from the base attack.

1359
01:31:36,078 --> 01:31:39,172
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type<i>,</i>

1360
01:31:40,049 --> 01:31:42,813
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1361
01:31:43,219 --> 01:31:45,881
Are we talking about an invasion?

1362
01:31:45,988 --> 01:31:49,082
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1363
01:31:49,191 --> 01:31:52,524
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1364
01:31:52,628 --> 01:31:54,357
That's why the virus shut us down<i>,</i>

1365
01:31:54,463 --> 01:31:57,762
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack<i>,</i>

1366
01:31:57,867 --> 01:32:02,361
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1367
01:32:06,242 --> 01:32:08,574
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1368
01:32:08,677 --> 01:32:12,078
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1369
01:32:12,181 --> 01:32:15,514
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1370
01:32:15,618 --> 01:32:18,587
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1371
01:32:28,797 --> 01:32:32,062
Captain Lennox<i>,</i> we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1372
01:32:32,168 --> 01:32:33,135
Let's go!

1373
01:32:38,174 --> 01:32:39,664
She's in here.

1374
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:41,703
What's going on?

1375
01:32:42,244 --> 01:32:44,075
You're coming with me.

1376
01:32:44,513 --> 01:32:47,209
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me<i>,</i> too?

1377
01:32:48,217 --> 01:32:49,548
Who's this?

1378
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:53,413
- He's my advisor.
- He comes<i>,</i> too.

1379
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,191
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1380
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:12,536
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1381
01:33:12,641 --> 01:33:13,608
Wow.

1382
01:33:14,276 --> 01:33:15,402
Who knew?

1383
01:33:32,194 --> 01:33:34,094
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1384
01:33:44,907 --> 01:33:47,637
Please<i>,</i> let this work.

1385
01:33:49,044 --> 01:33:50,944
Fire it up<i>,</i> Optimus.

1386
01:33:51,914 --> 01:33:53,404
The code.

1387
01:33:53,515 --> 01:33:58,919
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1388
01:34:00,723 --> 01:34:04,523
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1389
01:34:05,694 --> 01:34:07,457
They must know it's here<i>,</i> as well.

1390
01:34:07,563 --> 01:34:08,894
What about Bumblebee?

1391
01:34:08,998 --> 01:34:13,059
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1392
01:34:13,168 --> 01:34:17,161
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1393
01:34:17,273 --> 01:34:21,505
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1394
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:24,545
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1395
01:34:25,948 --> 01:34:29,315
<i>They're a primitive and violent race.</i>

1396
01:34:31,654 --> 01:34:33,645
Were we so different?

1397
01:34:34,556 --> 01:34:38,925
<i>They're a young species.</i>
<i>They have much to learn.</i>

1398
01:34:39,028 --> 01:34:41,826
<i>But I've seen goodness in them.</i>

1399
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:46,094
<i>Freedom is the right of</i>
<i>all sentient beings.</i>

1400
01:34:46,201 --> 01:34:50,433
<i>You all know there's only one way</i>
<i>to end this war.</i>

1401
01:34:50,539 --> 01:34:53,235
<i>We must destroy the Cube.</i>

1402
01:34:54,043 --> 01:34:58,605
If all else fails<i>,</i> I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1403
01:34:58,714 --> 01:35:00,045
That's suicide.

1404
01:35:00,149 --> 01:35:03,949
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1405
01:35:04,053 --> 01:35:08,513
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1406
01:35:08,624 --> 01:35:11,923
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1407
01:35:13,395 --> 01:35:16,091
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1408
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:19,998
- Autobots<i>,</i> roll out!
- We rolling!

1409
01:35:32,047 --> 01:35:35,210
Team attention! Present arms!

1410
01:35:35,884 --> 01:35:40,116
At ease. Captain<i>,</i> Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1411
01:35:40,222 --> 01:35:41,917
Thank you<i>,</i> sir.
What about the gunships?

1412
01:35:42,024 --> 01:35:44,151
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1413
01:35:44,259 --> 01:35:45,521
If they hit us again<i>,</i>
we'll be ready for them.

1414
01:35:45,627 --> 01:35:48,721
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1415
01:35:50,232 --> 01:35:51,460
Hey<i>,</i> kid.

1416
01:35:52,534 --> 01:35:55,196
I think we got off to a bad start<i>,</i> huh?

1417
01:35:55,738 --> 01:35:56,830
You must be hungry?

1418
01:35:56,939 --> 01:35:58,930
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1419
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:00,668
Where's my car?

1420
01:36:00,776 --> 01:36:04,337
Son<i>,</i> I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1421
01:36:04,847 --> 01:36:06,542
People can die here.

1422
01:36:06,915 --> 01:36:09,611
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1423
01:36:09,718 --> 01:36:10,912
Okay.

1424
01:36:11,019 --> 01:36:14,750
But first<i>,</i> I'll take my car<i>,</i> my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1425
01:36:14,857 --> 01:36:19,556
Oh<i>,</i> and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like<i>,</i> forever.

1426
01:36:21,196 --> 01:36:24,165
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1427
01:36:24,266 --> 01:36:25,563
Thank you.

1428
01:36:27,035 --> 01:36:28,764
The man's an extortionist.

1429
01:36:30,506 --> 01:36:31,837
All right<i>,</i> here's the situation.

1430
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:34,340
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1431
01:36:34,443 --> 01:36:35,535
NBEs?

1432
01:36:35,644 --> 01:36:39,239
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1433
01:36:39,348 --> 01:36:42,977
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1434
01:36:52,161 --> 01:36:52,728
Dear God. What is this?

1435
01:36:52,728 --> 01:36:53,990
Dear God. What is this?

1436
01:36:55,564 --> 01:36:58,829
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole<i>,</i>

1437
01:36:58,934 --> 01:37:02,370
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1438
01:37:02,471 --> 01:37:06,464
He crashed in the ice<i>,</i>
probably a few thousand years ago.

1439
01:37:06,575 --> 01:37:09,840
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1440
01:37:09,945 --> 01:37:12,345
We call him NBE One.

1441
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:14,814
Well<i>,</i> sir<i>,</i> I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know<i>,</i>

1442
01:37:14,917 --> 01:37:17,317
but<i>,</i> I mean<i>,</i> that's Megatron.

1443
01:37:18,587 --> 01:37:20,418
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1444
01:37:20,522 --> 01:37:23,855
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1445
01:37:23,959 --> 01:37:27,417
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1446
01:37:27,529 --> 01:37:28,962
in the history of mankind.

1447
01:37:29,064 --> 01:37:31,999
Fact is<i>,</i> you're looking at
the source of the modern age<i>,</i>

1448
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:38,938
the microchip<i>,</i> lasers<i>,</i> spaceflight<i>,</i> cars<i>,</i>
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1449
01:37:39,041 --> 01:37:42,841
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1450
01:37:43,412 --> 01:37:46,040
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1451
01:37:46,148 --> 01:37:48,514
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1452
01:37:48,617 --> 01:37:52,610
Until these events<i>,</i> we had no
credible threat to national security.

1453
01:37:52,721 --> 01:37:54,586
Well<i>,</i> you got one now.

1454
01:37:55,524 --> 01:37:57,924
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1455
01:37:58,026 --> 01:37:59,550
All Spark? What is that?

1456
01:37:59,661 --> 01:38:02,221
Well<i>,</i> yeah<i>,</i> they came here looking
for some sort of cube-Iooking thing.

1457
01:38:02,331 --> 01:38:07,098
Anyway<i>,</i> Mr. NBE One here<i>,</i> AKA
Megatron<i>,</i> that's what they call him<i>,</i>

1458
01:38:07,202 --> 01:38:09,636
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death<i>,</i> wants to use the Cube

1459
01:38:09,738 --> 01:38:12,832
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1460
01:38:12,941 --> 01:38:14,465
That's their plan.

1461
01:38:14,576 --> 01:38:16,976
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1462
01:38:19,314 --> 01:38:21,578
You guys know where it is<i>,</i> don't you?

1463
01:38:23,018 --> 01:38:24,144
Follow me.

1464
01:38:27,789 --> 01:38:30,280
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1465
01:38:39,234 --> 01:38:42,795
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10<i>,</i>000 BC.

1466
01:38:43,705 --> 01:38:47,334
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1467
01:38:48,176 --> 01:38:52,044
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1468
01:38:52,147 --> 01:38:53,671
as well as NBE One.

1469
01:38:53,782 --> 01:38:56,342
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1470
01:38:56,451 --> 01:38:58,817
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1471
01:38:58,921 --> 01:39:02,254
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1472
01:39:02,357 --> 01:39:05,952
or any alien species on the outside.

1473
01:39:44,766 --> 01:39:48,566
Wait<i>,</i> back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1474
01:39:49,204 --> 01:39:51,695
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1475
01:39:56,278 --> 01:39:59,145
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1476
01:40:05,053 --> 01:40:06,714
Oh<i>,</i> wow.

1477
01:40:06,822 --> 01:40:08,847
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1478
01:40:08,957 --> 01:40:10,151
Oh<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> man.

1479
01:40:10,292 --> 01:40:14,752
Freddy Krueger have four blades<i>,</i> man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1480
01:40:14,863 --> 01:40:17,798
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1481
01:40:19,334 --> 01:40:22,360
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1482
01:40:22,471 --> 01:40:23,904
I got a phone.

1483
01:40:27,109 --> 01:40:29,703
Nokias are real nasty.

1484
01:40:29,811 --> 01:40:34,248
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1485
01:40:35,050 --> 01:40:37,177
Nokia's from Finland.

1486
01:40:37,285 --> 01:40:41,847
Yes<i>,</i> but he's<i>,</i> you know<i>,</i> a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1487
01:40:44,626 --> 01:40:50,189
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1488
01:41:03,879 --> 01:41:07,178
- Mean little sucker<i>,</i> huh?
- That thing is freaky!

1489
01:41:07,282 --> 01:41:10,945
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell<i>,</i> huh?

1490
01:41:21,963 --> 01:41:23,828
He's breaking the box.

1491
01:41:41,817 --> 01:41:42,943
Go! Go! Go!

1492
01:41:43,051 --> 01:41:44,143
Move!

1493
01:41:52,694 --> 01:41:55,322
Gentlemen<i>,</i> they know the Cube is here.

1494
01:41:56,098 --> 01:41:57,429
Banachek. What's going on?

1495
01:41:57,532 --> 01:41:59,363
Well<i>,</i> the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1496
01:41:59,468 --> 01:42:00,526
- What?
<i>...and the backup generator</i>

1497
01:42:00,635 --> 01:42:02,603
<i>- is just not gonna cut it.</i>
- Do you have an arms room?

1498
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:10,773
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1499
01:42:10,879 --> 01:42:12,278
I'll bring security to the...

1500
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:14,905
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1501
01:42:15,016 --> 01:42:16,608
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1502
01:42:16,718 --> 01:42:18,083
Let's go!

1503
01:42:18,186 --> 01:42:19,949
They're popping our generators!

1504
01:42:31,967 --> 01:42:33,332
Megatron melting!

1505
01:42:33,969 --> 01:42:37,029
<i>16502. We're losing pressure.</i>

1506
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:39,334
Stand by! Set!

1507
01:42:39,441 --> 01:42:41,500
<i>We're losing pressure!</i>

1508
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:45,046
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!</i>
<i>We're losing NBE One!</i>

1509
01:42:49,785 --> 01:42:52,481
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1510
01:42:52,587 --> 01:42:56,580
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1511
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:04,758
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1512
01:43:04,866 --> 01:43:05,890
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1513
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:07,935
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1514
01:43:08,036 --> 01:43:09,765
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1515
01:43:09,871 --> 01:43:11,133
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know<i>,</i> but I don't know.

1516
01:43:11,239 --> 01:43:12,604
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1517
01:43:12,707 --> 01:43:14,698
I have people's lives at stake here<i>,</i>
young man.

1518
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:16,539
Take him to his car!

1519
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:19,474
Drop it.

1520
01:43:21,249 --> 01:43:22,910
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1521
01:43:24,186 --> 01:43:26,177
Drop your weapon<i>,</i> soldier.

1522
01:43:26,688 --> 01:43:28,417
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1523
01:43:28,523 --> 01:43:29,547
You know<i>,</i> we didn't ask to be here.

1524
01:43:29,658 --> 01:43:31,853
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1525
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,120
S-Seven don't exist.

1526
01:43:33,228 --> 01:43:34,991
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1527
01:43:35,096 --> 01:43:38,361
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well<i>,</i> I'm gonna count to three.

1528
01:43:40,969 --> 01:43:42,596
- Simmons?
- Yes<i>,</i> sir?

1529
01:43:42,704 --> 01:43:46,765
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1530
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:53,247
All right. Okay.

1531
01:43:53,348 --> 01:43:57,978
Hey<i>,</i> you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1532
01:44:01,423 --> 01:44:02,685
No<i>,</i> no!

1533
01:44:03,658 --> 01:44:06,320
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1534
01:44:06,428 --> 01:44:09,989
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> stop<i>,</i> stop<i>,</i> stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1535
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:12,598
Are you okay?

1536
01:44:14,469 --> 01:44:16,562
They didn't hurt you<i>,</i> right?

1537
01:44:25,313 --> 01:44:29,113
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1538
01:44:31,519 --> 01:44:33,612
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1539
01:44:33,722 --> 01:44:35,952
They're not gonna hurt you.

1540
01:44:36,057 --> 01:44:39,584
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1541
01:44:39,694 --> 01:44:42,959
Okay<i>,</i> come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1542
01:44:43,064 --> 01:44:44,554
Here<i>,</i> come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1543
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:10,113
Okay<i>,</i> here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1544
01:45:30,245 --> 01:45:31,576
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

1545
01:45:36,384 --> 01:45:37,783
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

1546
01:45:37,886 --> 01:45:39,285
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

1547
01:45:39,387 --> 01:45:42,413
He's right. We stay here<i>,</i> we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1548
01:45:42,524 --> 01:45:43,923
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1549
01:45:44,025 --> 01:45:45,322
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1550
01:45:45,427 --> 01:45:46,826
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1551
01:45:46,928 --> 01:45:47,895
Good! Right.

1552
01:45:47,996 --> 01:45:50,726
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1553
01:45:50,832 --> 01:45:52,891
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1554
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:54,866
- Yes. Shortwave<i>,</i> CB.
- Right<i>,</i> yes.

1555
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:57,564
Sir<i>,</i> you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1556
01:45:57,672 --> 01:45:59,105
In the alien archive<i>,</i> sir!

1557
01:45:59,207 --> 01:46:01,198
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1558
01:46:01,309 --> 01:46:02,833
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1559
01:46:02,944 --> 01:46:05,378
- Did you see that...
- All right<i>,</i> Sam<i>,</i> get it in the car!

1560
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:07,243
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1561
01:46:07,349 --> 01:46:08,976
When we get to the city<i>,</i>
we're gonna find a radio<i>,</i>

1562
01:46:09,084 --> 01:46:11,052
and I'll have Epps vector them in<i>,</i> okay?

1563
01:46:11,152 --> 01:46:12,676
Affirmative!

1564
01:46:12,787 --> 01:46:16,621
<i>Warning! NBE One</i>
<i>cryo-containment failing.</i>

1565
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:19,490
Check that backup system!

1566
01:46:19,594 --> 01:46:23,758
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1567
01:46:23,865 --> 01:46:25,355
Come on! Get out of here!

1568
01:46:25,467 --> 01:46:26,991
Heads up! Look out!

1569
01:46:28,003 --> 01:46:30,403
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1570
01:46:30,505 --> 01:46:33,941
- This way<i>,</i> this way<i>,</i> this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

1571
01:46:43,651 --> 01:46:46,711
I am Megatron!

1572
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:06,939
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah<i>,</i> it's fine.

1573
01:47:07,042 --> 01:47:08,031
Well<i>,</i> put the seat belt on.

1574
01:47:08,143 --> 01:47:09,303
Pour it on him!

1575
01:47:23,058 --> 01:47:25,049
I live to serve you<i>,</i> Lord Megatron.

1576
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,560
Where is the Cube?

1577
01:47:27,662 --> 01:47:29,721
The humans have taken it.

1578
01:47:33,101 --> 01:47:36,969
You fail me yet again<i>,</i> Starscream.
Get them!

1579
01:47:37,405 --> 01:47:38,872
Come on<i>,</i> Mags!

1580
01:47:39,974 --> 01:47:41,464
Over here<i>,</i> sir!

1581
01:47:43,812 --> 01:47:45,871
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1582
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:48,414
Come to me<i>,</i> Maxwell<i>,</i> come to me.
Plugged in there.

1583
01:47:50,318 --> 01:47:53,776
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1584
01:47:54,823 --> 01:47:55,812
Mikes?

1585
01:47:55,924 --> 01:47:57,186
This doesn't work without mikes<i>,</i>
Simmons.

1586
01:47:57,292 --> 01:47:58,850
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no!

1587
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,484
Let's find them.

1588
01:48:00,595 --> 01:48:02,062
Kid<i>,</i> get in the chair!
Just get in the chair<i>,</i> all right?

1589
01:48:02,163 --> 01:48:04,324
- Okay<i>,</i> I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

1590
01:48:04,432 --> 01:48:07,492
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1591
01:48:07,602 --> 01:48:08,899
- Glen?
- Huh?

1592
01:48:09,003 --> 01:48:12,495
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1593
01:48:12,607 --> 01:48:13,596
What good is that?

1594
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:16,108
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1595
01:48:16,211 --> 01:48:19,772
Okay<i>,</i> I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay<i>,</i> let's see.

1596
01:48:19,881 --> 01:48:21,712
Simmons<i>,</i> I need a screwdriver!

1597
01:48:33,495 --> 01:48:35,019
There's Optimus.

1598
01:48:52,981 --> 01:48:54,448
Almost done.

1599
01:48:56,284 --> 01:48:58,184
What the hell was that?

1600
01:49:01,256 --> 01:49:02,951
Barricade the door!

1601
01:49:05,693 --> 01:49:08,059
- Get something.
- Watch out!

1602
01:49:08,163 --> 01:49:10,256
Six<i>,</i> five<i>,</i> four<i>,</i> six<i>,</i> three.

1603
01:49:14,936 --> 01:49:17,302
Here! Put some rounds in!

1604
01:49:20,175 --> 01:49:21,608
Master search.

1605
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:24,501
I got it! We're transmitting!

1606
01:49:24,612 --> 01:49:25,738
Send exactly what I say!

1607
01:49:25,847 --> 01:49:29,977
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn<i>,</i> you little sucker! Burn!

1608
01:49:30,084 --> 01:49:34,111
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1609
01:49:34,222 --> 01:49:35,746
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1610
01:49:37,458 --> 01:49:38,482
What was that?

1611
01:49:38,593 --> 01:49:41,426
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1612
01:49:43,598 --> 01:49:45,793
Sir<i>,</i> I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1613
01:50:10,525 --> 01:50:12,493
- No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.
- What?

1614
01:50:12,594 --> 01:50:16,030
It's the same cop!
Block them<i>,</i> block them<i>,</i> block them.

1615
01:50:37,252 --> 01:50:38,241
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

1616
01:51:06,814 --> 01:51:08,145
Cool<i>,</i> Mom!

1617
01:51:34,042 --> 01:51:36,033
This is so not good.

1618
01:51:54,529 --> 01:51:56,394
He's behind the pillar!

1619
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:05,364
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie<i>,</i> cover fire!

1620
01:52:08,509 --> 01:52:10,841
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1621
01:52:14,716 --> 01:52:16,684
Sucker<i>,</i> burn!

1622
01:52:22,457 --> 01:52:23,788
Oh<i>,</i> shit!

1623
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:26,150
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1624
01:52:27,362 --> 01:52:29,387
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,</i>
<i>scramble, scramble.</i>

1625
01:52:30,598 --> 01:52:32,862
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

1626
01:52:35,203 --> 01:52:36,670
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

1627
01:52:37,572 --> 01:52:39,733
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

1628
01:52:47,315 --> 01:52:50,876
- Come on<i>,</i> let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1629
01:52:50,985 --> 01:52:53,180
Here<i>,</i> I got shortwave radios.

1630
01:52:53,721 --> 01:52:55,916
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1631
01:52:56,023 --> 01:52:58,321
Well<i>,</i> use them! It's all we got!

1632
01:52:58,726 --> 01:53:01,718
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something<i>,</i> man.

1633
01:53:01,829 --> 01:53:04,764
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1634
01:53:04,866 --> 01:53:07,562
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1635
01:53:08,169 --> 01:53:09,761
F-22 at 12:00.

1636
01:53:09,871 --> 01:53:12,567
All right<i>,</i> I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1637
01:53:12,673 --> 01:53:14,538
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1638
01:53:17,044 --> 01:53:19,444
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1639
01:53:19,747 --> 01:53:21,374
Raptor<i>,</i> Raptor<i>,</i> do you copy?

1640
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:23,810
<i>We have you visual.</i>

1641
01:53:25,486 --> 01:53:26,817
<i>Green smoke is the mark.</i>

1642
01:53:26,921 --> 01:53:30,379
<i>Provide air cover and vector</i>
<i>Black Hawks for extraction.</i>

1643
01:53:35,029 --> 01:53:36,997
It's Starscream!

1644
01:53:37,465 --> 01:53:39,126
Please tell me you copy.

1645
01:53:39,467 --> 01:53:41,765
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1646
01:53:45,573 --> 01:53:47,541
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no! Move!

1647
01:53:47,642 --> 01:53:50,805
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1648
01:53:50,912 --> 01:53:52,140
Incoming!

1649
01:54:17,238 --> 01:54:19,035
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1650
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:20,607
Clear the area!

1651
01:54:26,414 --> 01:54:27,938
Oh<i>,</i> my God.

1652
01:54:28,816 --> 01:54:31,683
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1653
01:54:32,119 --> 01:54:33,450
Your legs.

1654

Here. Here<i>,</i> back<i>,</i> back<i>,</i> back<i>,</i> back!
You all right?

1656
01:54:44,198 --> 01:54:45,392
Ratchet!

1657
01:54:47,268 --> 01:54:48,735
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1658
01:54:48,836 --> 01:54:50,770
What do you mean<i>,</i> what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

1659
01:54:50,872 --> 01:54:53,238
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1660
01:54:53,341 --> 01:54:55,502
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1661
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:58,408
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1662
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:00,704
Come on!

1663

It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1677
01:57:27,762 --> 01:57:29,787
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1678
01:57:29,897 --> 01:57:32,161
We need air cover down here now!

1679
01:57:38,172 --> 01:57:39,571
Sam<i>,</i> help me with this.

1680

- That all you got<i>,</i> Megatron?

You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1682

No! I want two!

1683
01:57:54,255 --> 01:57:55,654
What's going on?

1684
01:57:57,458 --> 01:58:00,086
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1685
01:58:00,961 --> 01:58:03,225
Oh<i>,</i> these things just don't die.

1686
01:58:06,801 --> 01:58:08,291
Oh<i>,</i> we're so dead.

1687
01:58:08,402 --> 01:58:10,734
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1688
01:58:11,038 --> 01:58:12,027
Where's the Cube?

1689
01:58:12,139 --> 01:58:13,106
- Right there.
- Okay.

1690
01:58:13,207 --> 01:58:14,196
And take that and wrap it around

1691
01:58:14,308 --> 01:58:15,275
the base and then put it
around his neck.

- Okay.
- What?

01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:29,589
All right<i>,</i> I can't leave my guys back
there<i>,</i> so here<i>,</i> take this flare.

1696
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:31,954
Okay<i>,</i> there's a tall<i>,</i> white building
with statues on top.

1697
01:58:32,059 --> 01:58:34,254
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1698
01:58:34,361 --> 01:58:36,295
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No<i>,</i> no. I can't do this!

Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1700
01:58:40,901 --> 01:58:43,131
Get it into military hands

till I get Bumblebee out of here<i>,</i> okay?

1705
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:53,538
Army Black Hawk requested.

1706
01:58:53,647 --> 01:58:56,172
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1707

<i>Headed to rooftop marked by flare.</i>

- Epps<i>,</i> where are those planes?
- Sam!

1710

Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1712
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:24,272
- Decepticons<i>,</i> attack!
- Hit it!

1713

- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1714
01:59:35,556 --> 01:59:36,853
Watch out!

1715

- Girl<i>,</i> get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

1716
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:47,260
Get out of here now!

1717
02:00:15,129 --> 02:00:16,096
Megatron!

Prime.

1719
02:00:43,324 --> 02:00:45,383
Humans don't deserve to live.

1720
02:00:45,492 --> 02:00:48,154
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1721
02:00:48,596 --> 02:00:50,962
Then you will die with them!

1722
02:00:56,637 --> 02:00:59,037
Join them in extinction!

1723
02:01:18,259 --> 02:01:19,920
Keep moving<i>,</i> Sam!

1724

Give me that Cube<i>,</i> boy!

1728
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:21,413
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1729

You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

I smell you<i>,</i> boy!

Oh<i>,</i> no!

1733
02:03:53,247 --> 02:03:55,078
I'll drive! You shoot!

1734
02:04:16,036 --> 02:04:17,333
This isn't going well!

1735
02:04:17,438 --> 02:04:18,837
Shoot! Shoot!

1736
02:05:04,685 --> 02:05:05,913
Nice shot.

1737
02:05:06,019 --> 02:05:09,477
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right<i>,</i> let's go! We got business!

1738
02:05:19,967 --> 02:05:21,025
Hey!

1739
02:05:24,505 --> 02:05:27,941
Hey! I'm over here!

1740
02:05:40,287 --> 02:05:41,982
We've got the boy.

1741
02:05:46,593 --> 02:05:48,026
Watch out!

1742
02:05:48,395 --> 02:05:49,589
Missile!

1743
02:06:00,073 --> 02:06:01,506
Hang on<i>,</i> Sam!

1744
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:11,581
No! No!

1745
02:06:17,291 --> 02:06:22,319
Is it fear or courage
that compels you<i>,</i> fleshling?

1746
02:06:35,876 --> 02:06:37,343
Where do I go?

1747
02:06:38,679 --> 02:06:42,638
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1748
02:06:43,951 --> 02:06:45,578
Oh<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no.

1749
02:06:49,756 --> 02:06:52,190
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1750
02:06:52,326 --> 02:06:55,124
Oh<i>,</i> so unwise.

1751
02:07:07,074 --> 02:07:08,564
I got you<i>,</i> boy.

1752
02:07:10,377 --> 02:07:12,174
Hold on to the Cube!

1753
02:07:31,865 --> 02:07:34,732
- Oh<i>,</i> no. Oh<i>,</i> no!
- Disgusting.

1754
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:40,764
Sam?

1755
02:07:45,045 --> 02:07:48,276
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1756
02:07:49,016 --> 02:07:50,483
No sacrifice<i>,</i>

1757
02:07:51,852 --> 02:07:54,912
- no victory.
- Lf I cannot defeat Megatron<i>,</i>

1758
02:07:55,255 --> 02:07:57,746
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1759
02:07:58,158 --> 02:08:01,355
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1760
02:08:01,828 --> 02:08:03,295
Get behind me.

1761
02:08:04,998 --> 02:08:07,558
It's you and me<i>,</i> Megatron.

1762
02:08:07,668 --> 02:08:10,603
No<i>,</i> it's just me<i>,</i> Prime.

1763
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:18,171
At the end of this day<i>,</i>
one shall stand<i>,</i> one shall fall.

1764
02:08:23,583 --> 02:08:28,418
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1765
02:08:47,574 --> 02:08:49,974
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1766
02:08:50,077 --> 02:08:52,545
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1767
02:08:52,646 --> 02:08:53,670
Hey.

1768
02:08:54,881 --> 02:08:57,042
Bring the rain. All right?

1769
02:08:57,451 --> 02:08:59,442
All right<i>,</i> let's kill these things.

1770
02:09:01,421 --> 02:09:02,979
- Move<i>,</i> move<i>,</i> move!
- Remember<i>,</i> aim low.

1771
02:09:03,090 --> 02:09:05,081
Armor's weak under the chest.

1772
02:09:15,168 --> 02:09:16,726
Target marked. Still waiting.

1773
02:09:16,837 --> 02:09:18,862
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

1774
02:09:25,812 --> 02:09:27,905
F-22s<i>,</i> we're still waiting.

1775
02:09:33,153 --> 02:09:34,586
Move out!

1776
02:09:37,824 --> 02:09:39,052
Incoming!

1777
02:09:47,601 --> 02:09:49,694
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

1778
02:10:08,355 --> 02:10:10,186
Run! Move!

1779
02:10:17,697 --> 02:10:19,221
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

1780
02:10:22,736 --> 02:10:24,328
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

1781
02:10:24,438 --> 02:10:26,906
<i>- Copy.</i>
<i>- It's either a massive amount of...</i>

1782
02:10:35,649 --> 02:10:37,810
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

1783
02:10:41,888 --> 02:10:43,981
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

1784
02:10:44,357 --> 02:10:45,654
Take him out!

1785
02:10:59,873 --> 02:11:01,204
Two's down!

1786
02:11:10,650 --> 02:11:12,584
I'll kill you!

1787
02:11:12,686 --> 02:11:15,450
Mine! All Spark!

1788
02:11:16,423 --> 02:11:19,290
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1789
02:11:19,993 --> 02:11:21,017
Sam!

1790
02:11:21,895 --> 02:11:23,089
No<i>,</i> Sam!

1791
02:11:48,922 --> 02:11:50,082
Hold up.

1792
02:11:53,193 --> 02:11:56,162
You left me no choice<i>,</i> brother.

1793
02:12:05,772 --> 02:12:08,639
Sam<i>,</i> I owe you my life.

1794
02:12:09,776 --> 02:12:11,505
We are in your debt.

1795
02:12:31,031 --> 02:12:33,431
Prime<i>,</i> we couldn't save him.

1796
02:12:34,301 --> 02:12:35,598
Jazz.

1797
02:12:38,805 --> 02:12:41,000
We lost a great comrade

1798
02:12:42,342 --> 02:12:44,207
but gained new ones.

1799
02:12:44,477 --> 02:12:46,775
Thank you<i>,</i> all of you.

1800
02:12:47,113 --> 02:12:49,479
You honor us with your bravery.

1801
02:12:50,517 --> 02:12:52,485
Permission to speak<i>,</i> sir?

1802
02:12:52,986 --> 02:12:55,853
Permission granted<i>,</i> old friend.

1803
02:12:55,956 --> 02:12:57,423
You speak now?

1804
02:12:58,358 --> 02:13:00,451
I wish to stay with the boy.

1805
02:13:01,328 --> 02:13:03,159
If that is his choice.

1806
02:13:08,101 --> 02:13:09,125
Yes.

1807
02:13:29,789 --> 02:13:34,522
Gentlemen<i>,</i> the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1808
02:13:35,061 --> 02:13:38,087
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1809
02:13:38,732 --> 02:13:42,031
<i>The Laurentian Abyss is</i>
<i>seven miles below sea level,</i>

1810
02:13:42,135 --> 02:13:44,228
<i>deepest place on our planet.</i>

1811
02:13:44,471 --> 02:13:47,998
<i>The massive depth and pressure there,</i>
<i>coupled with subfreezing temperatures,</i>

1812
02:13:48,108 --> 02:13:50,303
<i>would crush and entomb them,</i>

1813
02:13:52,112 --> 02:13:53,841
<i>leaving no evidence.</i>

1814
02:14:00,487 --> 02:14:04,890
<i>With the All Spark gone,</i>
<i>we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

1815
02:14:06,626 --> 02:14:09,220
<i>And fate has yielded its reward,</i>

1816
02:14:10,764 --> 02:14:13,665
<i>a new world to call home.</i>

1817
02:14:19,939 --> 02:14:24,137
<i>We live among its people now,</i>
<i>hiding in plain sight,</i>

1818
02:14:24,277 --> 02:14:27,041
<i>but watching over them in secret,</i>

1819
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,840
<i>waiting, protecting.</i>

1820
02:14:31,251 --> 02:14:34,277
<i>I have witnessed</i>
<i>their capacity for courage.</i>

1821
02:14:34,888 --> 02:14:37,880
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

1822
02:14:37,991 --> 02:14:42,928
<i>like us, there's more to them</i>
<i>than meets the eye.</i>

1823
02:14:44,464 --> 02:14:46,955
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

1824
02:14:47,367 --> 02:14:50,734
<i>and I send this message</i>
<i>to any surviving Autobots</i>

1825
02:14:50,837 --> 02:14:53,829
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

1826
02:14:54,874 --> 02:14:56,603
<i>We are here.</i>

1827
02:14:57,177 --> 02:14:59,202
<i>We are waiting.</i>

1828
02:15:18,498 --> 02:15:23,526
Can you shed any light on the recent<i>,</i>
so-called alien activity in the area?

1829
02:15:26,539 --> 02:15:32,034
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1830
02:15:32,645 --> 02:15:34,545
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1831
02:15:34,914 --> 02:15:37,348
They<i>,</i> the government<i>,</i>
would be the first to let you know.

1832
02:15:37,450 --> 02:15:39,111
The government would let us know.

1833
02:15:39,285 --> 02:15:40,877
- I mean<i>,</i> this is America.
- Yeah.

1834
02:15:40,987 --> 02:15:43,421
You know<i>,</i> that's how we know
we live in a free land<i>,</i>

1835
02:15:43,523 --> 02:15:45,150
because there's no secrets.

1836
02:15:45,258 --> 02:15:47,351
They'd say<i>,</i> "Hey! Duck and cover."

1837
02:15:57,403 --> 02:16:00,702
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
