2
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,485
在很久的过去，能量体就已经存在了
Before time began, there was the Cube.

3
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,151
我们不知道它从哪里来
We know not where it comes from,

4
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,495
只知道它拥有创造世界和生命的力量
only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,094
我们这个种族就是这么诞生的
That is how our race was born.

6
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,671
我们一直和谐地生活着
For a time, we lived in harmony,

7
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:19,336
就像其它巨大的能量一样
人们要它的目的有善有恶
but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.

8
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,577
所以战争开始了
And so began the war,

9
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,710
一场使我们的星球毁灭的战争
a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,

10
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,953
能量体也丢失在浩瀚的宇宙里
and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.

11
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,360
我们搜寻了整个银河
希望可以找到它来重建我们的家园
We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,

12
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,960
寻找每一个星球，每一个世界
searching every star, every world.

13
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:50,443
就当我们都失去希望时
新的线索把我们带到了一个星球叫――
And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us

14
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,980
地球
to an unknown planet called Earth.

15
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:01,781
片名：《变形金刚》

16
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,255
但是我们已经太迟了
But we were already too late.

17
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:13,156
中东，卡塔尔
当代
Qutar

18
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,795
上帝啊，都已经5个月了
Oh, God, five months of this.

19
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,397
我都等不及要回家了
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

20
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,534
我很想念我妈妈煮的鳄鱼肉
A plate of mama's alligators etouffee.

21
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,805
你说这些烤肉蟋蟀
都说了2个星期了
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

22
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,076
我发誓我一定不会去你妈妈那里吃饭
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

23
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,482
博比，鳄鱼肉是出了名的嫩
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

24
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,644
我理解
I understand.

25
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,521
请说英语好吗？
English, please. English.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,323
我说过多少次了…
我们不讲西班牙语
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

27
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,625
干吗破坏我自己的传统？
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

28
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,663
你随便说吧
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

29
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,798
你们还记得我们是怎么过周末的吗？
在芬维公园看红袜队的比赛
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

30
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
- 美味的热狗和冰镇的啤酒
- 完美的一天
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

31
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,638
你呢，队长？
你也有完美的一天吗？
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

32
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,780
我已经等不及去第一次抱我的女儿
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

33
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,375
- 好男人啊
- 太…
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

34
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,454
闭嘴！
Shut up!

35
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,375
我都准备好了
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

36
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
你们谁有胆就操场上见我
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

37
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,570
嘿！
Hey, hey!

38
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,878
小心我的胯下运球
Watch this crossover, baby.

39
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,147
就像乔丹全盛时期一样
穿梭于锋线间
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

40
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,149
- 让开点，小妞们
- 什么？
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

41
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,521
- 兰诺斯！
- 你好啊
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

42
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,220
- 要水吗？
- 谢谢
- Water?
- Thank you.

43
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,895
你要帮我拿装备吗？
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

44
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,371
夏普上校，有一身份不明的入侵者
距离10英里
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

45
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,606
不明身份的飞机
你现位于美军管制空域
Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.

46
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,516
请表明身份并
向东飞行离开美军的领空
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

47
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,453
猛禽1号，2号，目标方向250，进行拦截
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

48
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,393
目标距离10英里，没表明身份
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

49
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:33,037
不明身份的飞机
我们会护送你到美军桑克森空军基地
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

50
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,267
如果你不遵从，我们会使用致命的武力
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

51
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,577
发现目标
Copy the bogie.

52
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,239
机尾编号4500X
Tail 4500 X-ray.

53
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
长官，报告说4500X
在3个月前被击落了
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

54
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,748
- 在阿富汗
- 这一定是一个错误
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

55
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,912
- 检查，再检查
- 我检查过了，长官
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

56
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,990
我有一个朋友就在那架直升机上
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

57
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,591
不明身份的飞机
我们会护送你到桑克森空军基地
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

58
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,027
- 雷达，飞行物在哪？
- 目标5英里，长官
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

59
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,265
- 是我老婆吗？
- 是的，队长
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

60
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,268
- 我的公主！
- 看
- My ladies!
- Look.

61
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,373
哦，看啊，她都这么大了
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

62
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,606
看看她的小脸，真想去亲一口
Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.

63
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,439
我们的孩子真是漂亮
Baby, we made a good-Iooking kid.

64
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,677
我知道人们总是这么说
I know that people say that all the time,

65
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,152
我们生了一个漂亮的孩子，干得好
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

66
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,018
她笑得真像你
She has your laugh.

67
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,717
- 她笑了？
- 第一次呢
- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.

68
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,761
你确定她刚刚没有放屁吗？
You sure she didn't just fart?

69
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,659
没有，她可是一个淑女
No, she's a lady.

70
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,255
她还不认识你，但是她会的
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

71
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,670
4500X，好像有些不对劲
4500 X. Something's not right.

72
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,405
目标着落了
Bogie's on the deck.

73
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,642
雷达被干扰了
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

74
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,014
直升机是干扰源
It's coming from the chopper.

75
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,682
- 威尔？
- 萨拉？
- Will?
- Sarah?

76
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,705
莎拉，如果你能听见我
我爱你，我很快就会回家
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

77
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,623
莎拉，如果你能听见我
我爱你，我很快就会回家

78
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,623
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

79
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,322
- 到右边去，到右边去
- 检查弹药
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

80
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,398
MH-53飞行员，关闭你的发动机
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

81
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,765
让你的机组人员下机，不然我们会杀了你们
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

82
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,619
不要开火！待命！
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

83
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,855
上帝啊
My God.

84
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,143
他们炸了通讯天线
我们被攻击了
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

85
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,344
快逃！
Go! Move! Move!

86
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,983
它们想要的是这些机密文件！
It's going after the files!

87
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,454
切断总电源！
Cut the hard lines!

88
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
我要钥匙，它被锁上了！
I need a key! It's locked!

89
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,022
快逃！
Move! Move!

90
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,735
到这边！到这边！
Here, come here! Come here!

91
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,781
藏在这！
Here, hide in here!

92
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,986
哦，上帝啊
Oh, my God. Okay.

93
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,647
不！
No!

94
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,428
哦！
Oh!

95
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,236
怎么…
What the...

96
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,947
埃普斯，快走！
Epps, let's go!

97
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,403
维特维奇先生，该你了
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

98
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,140
对不起，我带了很多东西
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

99
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,437
瞧吧
Watch.

100
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,545
好的
Okay.

101
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,242
对于我们家族...
For my family...

102
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,785
是谁干的？谁干的？
同学们，要有责任感
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

103
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,056
好吧
Okay.

104
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,183
对于家族史这个报告
So, for my family genealogy report,

105
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,422
我打算讲我的曾曾祖父
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

106
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,766
他是一个著名的人
阿奇伯尔德・维特维奇船长
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

107
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
著名的探索家
Very famous explorer.

108
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:35,796
实际上，他是第一个去探索北极的人
那是一件非常困难的事
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

109
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:43,104
在1897年
他带着41个勇敢的水手向北极出发
In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.

110
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
大家加把劲！敲！举起来！
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

111
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,723
冰结的比它化的还要快！
大家再加把劲！
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

112
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,656
没有付出就没有胜利
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

113
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,164
我们会到达那里的，伙计们！
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

114
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,364
这就是我要讲的故事
So that's the story, right?

115
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,665
这里，我有一些基本装备
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

116
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,603
是19世纪水手所用的
used by 19th-century seamen.

117
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,910
这是四分仪，价值80美元
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

118
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,308
这些都是要卖的
It's all for sale, by the way.

119
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:18,111
这个六分仪，50美元，非常超值
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

120
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,683
这个最酷了，它是我曾曾祖父的眼镜
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

121
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,516
我还没给它估价
它见过很多有趣的事
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

122
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,853
你要卖我他的肝吗？
Are you going to sell me his liver?

123
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,552
维特维奇先生，这不是跳蚤市场
这是11年级的课堂
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

124
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,753
我想你的祖父不会
I don't think your grandfather would be

125
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,090
为你所作所为感到骄傲的
particularly proud of what you're doing.

126
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,428
对不起，这些钱都是为了我的汽车基金
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

127
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,592
你可以告诉其他人，我在易趣卖
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

128
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,033
接受贝宝和现金
Cold hard cash works, too.

129
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,435
指南针是一个很好的哥伦布节的礼物
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

130
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,870
- 山姆
- 对不起
- Sam!
- Sorry.

131
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,803
不幸的是，我的曾曾祖父
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

132
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,744
他瞎了又疯了，关进精神病院
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

133
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,008
画这些奇怪的符号
drawing these strange symbols

134
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,584
说一些关于他所发现的
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

135
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,346
巨大的冰人的事情
that he thought he'd discovered.

136
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,287
也许明天会有考试
也许不会
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

137
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,689
- 今晚在恐惧中入睡吧
- 要吗？50，40 ，30？
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

138
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,125
- 山姆
- 对不起，对不起
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

139
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,789
很不错，对吗？
Okay. Pretty good, right?

140
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
我想B-是一个不错的成绩
I'd say a solid B-.

141
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,826
B-？
A B-?

142
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,963
你在说一些关于你曾曾祖父的无聊的事情
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

143
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,234
- 在我的课堂上
- 不，大家喜欢…
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

144
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,570
- 能帮个忙吗？
- 干什么？
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

145
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,009
你能看一下窗外吗？
看到我父亲了吗？
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

146
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,670
- 坐在绿色的车里
- 嗯
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

147
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,409
我要告诉你一个梦想
一个男孩的梦想
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

148
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
一个男人答应那个男孩
And a man's promise to that boy.

149
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,218
他看着我的眼睛说
“儿子，我会给你买一辆车
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

150
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
“但是你需要给我2000美元和3个A
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

151
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,818
我已经有了2000美元和2个A
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

152
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,987
这是我的梦想
你的B-，梦想破灭了
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

153
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,891
先生，你自问一下
如果是上帝，他会怎么做？
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

154
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,633
太棒了！
Yes! Yes, yes.

155
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,140
怎么样？
So?

156
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,441
A-，但也算A
A-. It's an A, though.

157
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
等一等，我看不清楚，是A，没问题
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

158
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,105
- 那么，通过啦？
- 通过啦
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

159
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,110
- 儿子，我有一个惊喜给你
- 什么样的惊喜？
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

160
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
小小的惊喜
Yeah, a little surprise.

161
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,081
不，不，不，不，爸爸！
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

162
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,547
- 你一定是在开玩笑
- 看？
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

163
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,594
是的，我是在开玩笑
你不会得到一辆保时捷
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

164
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,959
- 你认为那很可笑吗？
- 是的，非常可笑
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

165
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
- 你怎么回事？
- 你真以为我给你买的…
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

166
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,297
第一辆车就是保时捷？
a Porsche for your first car?

167
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
我以后不会再和你说这件事了
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

168
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,199
- 哦，拜托，就是个现实的笑话
- 一点不好笑
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

169
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,815
- 曼尼！
- 怎么？
- Manny!
- What?

170
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,377
别让你表弟穿这个
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

171
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,577
他热得发晕了
He's having a heat stroke again.

172
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,744
吓坏了白人客户
Scaring white folks.

173
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,754
我很热！妆要化了，我眼睛疼
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

174
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,184
这里？这是什么？
你说过，半辆车
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

175
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,850
不是半辆破烂，爸爸
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

176
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,326
我像你这么大时，能有辆车就很开心了
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

177
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,897
让我来解释解释，好吗？
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

178
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
- 看没看过《40岁的处男》？
- 看过
- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,527
这就是他，这是50岁的处男
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

180
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,399
- 好吧
- 你想我以后变成这样吗？
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

181
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
- 没有付出就没有胜利
- 嗯，我知道
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

182
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,069
- 我知道这句维奇家的格言
- 对
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

183
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,233
先生们
Gentlemen.

184
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,110
鲍比・玻利维亚，就像那个国家
除了不是逃来的
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

185
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,306
想要点什么？
How can I help you?

186
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,179
我儿子要买他的第一辆车
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

187
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,179
- 所以你来找我了？
- 没办法
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

188
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,657
那我们就是家人了
你可以叫我鲍比・B叔叔
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

189
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,125
- 山姆
- 山姆，我来跟你说
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

190
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,090
山姆，你的第一道大餐就在那里面
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

191
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
我来告诉你
不是驾驶员挑车
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

192
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,232
而是车挑驾驶员
The car'll pick the driver.

193
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,137
这是人类和汽车间的缘分
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

194
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,143
孩子，我本事很大的，但不包括吹牛
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

195
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,773
尤其不在我妈妈面前
那就是我妈妈，嘿，妈咪！
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

196
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,544
别那样，我要是有块石头，就砸你的头
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

197
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,714
我告诉你，伙计，她聋了
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

198
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:52,353
看这边，每辆都不错
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

199
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,897
这辆不错
This ain't bad.

200
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,226
- 这车有赛车的条纹
- 是啊
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

201
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,667
有条纹…
It got racing...

202
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,170
这到底是哪辆？
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

203
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,036
我不知道这辆车
I don't know nothing about this car.

204
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,370
- 曼尼！
- 干什么？
- Manny!
- What?

205
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,070
这是谁的车？去查一下！
What is this? This car! Check it out!

206
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,670
我不知道，老板，我以前没见过！
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!

207
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,273
别唬我，快去查查！
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

208
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,908
感觉不错
Feels good.

209
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,483
- 多少钱
- 嗯
- How much?
- Well,

210
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,453
根据这辆车的外形
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

211
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,359
和特别的喷漆
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

212
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,525
- 漆已经掉色了
- 是的，但是喷漆是特殊的
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

213
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
那是特殊的掉色漆吗？
It's custom faded?

214
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,533
这是你第一辆车，我不指望你明白
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

215
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,437
- 5千
- 抱歉，不会超过4千
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

216
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,434
孩子，从车里出来
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

217
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
不，不，不
但是你说车挑驾驶员
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

218
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,409
但是有时那个驾驶员有一个抠门的父亲
快下车
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

219
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,678
这边这辆就4千美元了
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

220
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
那车也有赛车的条纹
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

221
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,615
我不想要那个带条纹的福特嘉年华
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

222
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,749
这车有一个经典的引擎
This is a classic engine right here.

223
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,191
前几天卖一辆
I sold a car the other day...

224
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,663
哦，天啊
Gee. Holy cow.

225
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,198
- 别担心
- 你没事吧？
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

226
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,066
我去弄个大锤把这个敲下来，嘿，曼尼！
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

227
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,831
让你表弟弄些锤子来
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

228
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,066
把这东西敲下去
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

229
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,109
…比人类伟大…
...greater than man...

230
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,304
那辆我最喜欢，一路从阿拉巴马开过来
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

231
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,530
4千
$4,000.

232
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,531
华盛顿
washington

233
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,336
史蒂文
Steve.

234
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,345
你好，部长先生
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

235
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,941
他们太年轻了
They're so young.

236
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,178
他们是最好的主题专家
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

237
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,550
这些年国家安全局直接从高中招人
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

238
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,022
同伴们，那是国防部部长
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

239
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,123
我穿的衣服真不适合这个场合
I am so underdressed.

240
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,220
女士们，先生们，国防部部长
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

241
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,761
请坐
Please be seated.

242
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,798
我是约翰・凯勒
I'm John Keller.

243
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,170
你们应该想知道你们为什么会在这里
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

244
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,443
在昨天当地时间19时
At 1900 local time yesterday,

245
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,742
在卡塔尔的桑克森
美军基地被攻击了
the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.

246
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,213
具目前所了解的资料，没有幸存者
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

247
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,918
攻击的目的是为了侵入军方的电脑网络
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

248
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,149
我们并不知道他们要找什么
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

249
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,693
但是我们知道他们的侵入被阻止了
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

250
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,662
所以我们认为他们会再次袭击
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

251
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
目前无人为攻击事件负责
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

252
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,161
我们现在唯一的线索是这个声音
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

253
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
那是侵入我们系统的信号
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

254
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,010
国家安全局正在全力分析它
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

255
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,587
希望来拦截未来的通讯
and intercept further communications,

256
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,486
我们需要你来找出谁是幕后的主脑
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

257
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,789
你们都有很强的信号分析技能
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

258
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,492
现在情况紧急
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

259
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,192
总统已经派出航母战斗群
The President has dispatched
battle groups

260
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,464
前往波斯湾和黄海
再也不会比这更严重了
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

261
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,198
你们会由负责的官员领导
Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.

262
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,207
领队们会把你们分成小组开始工作
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

263
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,833
祝我们好运
Good luck to us all.

264
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,723
好了，魔咒，我有车了
我需要一个女朋友
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

265
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,422
我还需要钱带她出去玩
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

266
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,654
0个竞标
Zero bids.

267
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,430
真是太好了，身无分文
Great. Broke.

268
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,901
魔咒，你想要你的止痛药吗？
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

269
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,203
还没熟透
No. Premature.

270
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,638
你好吗？
Good. What's up?

271
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,575
没什么，只是在开我的车，开我的车
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

272
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
就像是时钟发条
It's like clockwork.

273
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,774
我知道这东西让你恍惚了
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

274
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,943
但你要是再在我床上撒尿
就到外面睡去，明白？
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

275
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
今天到此为止了，别吃了，瘾君子
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

276
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,552
- 荣恩，这里不平
- 也许吧
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

277
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,854
这块要掉了
This one is wobbly.

278
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,057
- 是的，我会解决它的
- 我们能不能请一个专业的人？
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

279
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,291
- 山姆…
- 干什么？
- Sam...
- What?

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
我不想在我的草坪上看到脚印
I do not like footprints on my grass.

281
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,264
- 什么脚印？没脚印啊
- 这就是我为什么修了入门径
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

282
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,066
你为什么不从草地移到入门径上来？
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

283
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,300
- 这草是属于整个家的
- 当你拥有你自己的草地的时候
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

284
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,502
- 你会明白的
- 我受不了了
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

285
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,704
你把女性的饰品戴在一条雄性的狗身上
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

286
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,974
作为一条吉娃娃犬，他有严重的自信心问题
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

287
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,640
那是他的首饰
That's his bling.

288
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,951
在11点前回家！
I want you home at 11:00!

289
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,918
- 没问题
- 11点
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

290
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,148
看在上帝的份上，小心开车
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

291
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,485
系上安全带！
Seat belt on!

292
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,458
喔，你可真小气
Wow. You are so cheap.

293
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,569
那是他的第一辆车，应该是这样的
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

294
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,973
目前我们无法确认是否有幸存者存在
At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

295
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,484
天啊
Oh, my God.

296
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
我们现在进入防御状况四
Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,

297
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,647
这是最高警戒水平
our highest readiness level.

298
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,685
我们面对着一个从未见过的
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

299
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
非常强大的武器系统
that we have not come across before.

300
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
我们会为那些勇敢的士兵祈祷
But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...

301
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,226
爸爸会没事的
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

302
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,059
我以前从未见过这种武器系统
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

303
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,032
热成像显示在它的外骨骼结构周围
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

304
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
有一个无形的能量罩
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

305
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
那不可能，根本没有无形的能量罩
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

306
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,906
除了在漫画里
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

307
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,311
- 我不明白
- 怎么了？
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

308
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,574
我老妈，她有种天赋
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

309
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,653
我妈妈可以看到未来
我也有她的遗传
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

310
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,717
那个攻击我们的家伙
我预感它还会回来
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

311
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
你为什么不用你的巫术
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

312
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,019
让我们离开这里
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

313
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,496
当我照相的时候，我想它看到我了
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

314
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,464
它盯着我看
It looked right at me.

315
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
我们要马上把它送到五角大楼
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

316
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,007
他们要知道我们的敌人是什么
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

317
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
无线电失灵了
My radio's fried.

318
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,538
- 天线没有信号
- 马弗斯
- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.

319
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,615
- 你家离这里有多远？
- 不远了，翻过那座山就到了
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

320
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
- 那里有电话吗？
- 是的
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

321
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,012
好的，我们走
All right, let's hit it.

322
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,788
你确定我们被邀请去这个聚会了吗？
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

323
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,760
当然了，迈尔斯
那是一个湖，是公共场所
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

324
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

325
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,329
我的天啊，梅卡拉在这
别做奇怪的事，好吧？
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

326
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,994
- 我看上不错，对不对？
- 是的
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

327
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,071
好的
Okay.

328
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,740
快看
Hey, guys, check it out.

329
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,213
嘿
Oh, hi.

330
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,409
嘿，你的车不错
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

331
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,615
你们来这里干什么？
So, what are you guys doing here?

332
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,225
我们来这里爬这棵树
We're here to climb this tree.

333
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
看见了，很有趣
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

334
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,397
- 嗯
- 我想我认识你
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

335
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,467
你去年参加过橄榄球队的预选，对吧
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

336
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,333
我们去找你的妈妈
Let's go call your mom.

337
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,339
不，不是，我并不是想参加预选
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

338
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,137
我是在为写的书收集资料
I was researching a book I was writing.

339
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,541
- 是吗？
- 是的
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

340
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
关于什么的？一塌糊涂的体育运动？
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

341
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,145
不，是关于橄榄球和大脑受损的
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

342
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,483
那是一本好书，你的朋友会喜欢它的
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

343
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,752
有上色的地方，立体折叠…
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

344
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,419
…还有图片，非常有趣
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

345
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,222
真是好笑
That's funny.

346
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,024
不要这样
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

347
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,099
我们去参加聚会吧
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

348
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,263
快从树上下来…
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

349
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,967
快下来，拜托
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

350
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

351
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,270
看到下来的动作了？
女孩们都在看我
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

352
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,814
你使我看起来像个傻瓜
我们刚才都像傻瓜
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

353
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,181
- 让我开好吗？
- 这可不行，这可不是一个玩具车
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

354
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,255
这个22英寸的轮胎，我不想你开
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

355
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,348
我可爱的小白兔为什么不跳到后座上去
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

356
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,694
我可不是你的小白兔
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

357
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,299
好吧
Okay.

358
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,200
你会来找我的
You'll call me.

359
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,509
# 今晚谁开车送你回家？
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

360
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,101
你的收音机怎么了？
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

361
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,113
- 我要送她回家
- 什么？
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

362
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,843
她可是个小骚货，伙计
让她去搭车吧
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

363
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
她家离这里有10英里远
这是我唯一的机会
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

364
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,948
你要理解我，好吗
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

365
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,453
把她放在后座，我会安静的
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

366
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,183
- 你是不是说，“让她坐在后座”？
- 我说坐前面
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

367
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,088
我不会让她坐后面，你得下车
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

368
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,524
- 这可违反了聚会规则
- 什么规则？
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

369
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
不能重色轻友
Bros before hos.

370
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,692
迈尔斯，我求你下车
Miles, I'm begging you to get out

So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

379

我是说我开车送你回家
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

384

我不是说和你在一块
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

385
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,710
我是说现在这种状况
我总是这样
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just

for tight abs and really big arms.

388

Big arms?

Well, there's a couple new additions

我刚刚装了那个灯
Like, I just put in that light there.

391
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,991
那盏灯用来照射这个迪斯可球
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

392
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
没错
Yeah.

393

Yeah, a long time.

我们有同堂的课吗？
Well, do we have any classes together?

399

- 有的
- 真的？什么课？

I just...

404

- 没关系
- 我没认出你来
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

405
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,869
没什么，可以理解
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

不，不要，拜托
No, no, no. No. Come on.

Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

412

I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

413

这有点罗曼蒂克，我不想这样的
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

414
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,590
不应该对你这样的
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

- 当然
- 我是你的朋友
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

416

罗曼蒂克的朋友才这样
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

That's pretty impressive, Sam.

同时还从我们系统上
窃取了大量的信息
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

500
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,919
红色警报，网络被入侵了

501
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,760
空军一号，有人正在入侵军事网络
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

502
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,631
货舱没有人
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

503
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,640
- 你们必须切断热线
- 什么？
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

504
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,870
- 不管它们想要什么，它们正在得逞
- 长官？
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

505
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,675
请求切断防御网络
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

506
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,774
- 切断所有服务器的连接
- 切断所有服务器的连接
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

507
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,204
有人动过这里的主机
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

508
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,776
怎么…
What the...

509
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,650
底舱有人开枪，重复，有人开枪
Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.

510
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,586
机组，准备紧急降落
Crew, prepare for emergency descent.

511
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
我要总统现在就进入地下掩体
I want our President in that bunker.

512
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,803
我要在他安全后再讨论现在这个问题
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

513
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,007
这是我们现在唯一的目标
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

514
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,242
空军一号已经降落了
Air Force One is on the ground.

515
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,977
哦，上帝，不，不，不！
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

516
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,376
那是我的车！
That's my car!

517
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,152
不！
No!

518
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,383
不，不，不
No, no, no, no.

519
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,026
爸爸，报警
Dad, call the cops!

520
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,932
你要开我的车去哪？
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

521
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,772
我要报警，我的车被偷了！
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

522
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,336
我正在追他，把所有人都叫来！
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

523
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,246
把所有人都叫来！
别问我问题
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

524
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,013
我爸爸是邻居保安计划主管
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

525
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,211
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

526
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,036
我叫山姆・维特维奇
My name is Sam Witwicky.

527
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,075
不论谁看到这个，我的车活了
看到了？
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

528
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,906
这是我的遗言
我爱你爸爸，妈妈
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

529
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,378
如果你们从床下找到色情书刊
那不是我的
and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.

530
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,473
我是替迈尔斯在保存
不，等等…
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

531
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,212
不，那不是真的，是我的
查尔叔叔给我的，对不起
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

532
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,288
对不起，魔咒，我爱你
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

533
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,094
不！不！不！不！
No! No! No! No!

534
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,004
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

535
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,099
好狗，好狗，好狗！
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

536
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,402
哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

537
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:55,414
喔，好吧！好吧！
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

538
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,687
求求你，别杀我！
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

539
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,123
钥匙给你了，车我不要了！
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

540
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,363
听着，听着，听着
Listen, listen, listen.

541
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,796
- 真好，你们来了
- 把手举起来！
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

542
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,458
- 不不不，不是我
- 把手举起来让我看到
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

543
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,628
- 那个人在里面
- 住嘴，走向警车
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

544
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,302
把头顶到引擎罩上
Put your head on the hood.

545
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,318
他们终于还是侵入了我们的防卫网
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

546
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,949
他们当时尝试侵入我们的卡塔尔基地
不过这次他们得逞了
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

547
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,687
- 他们都弄到了什么？
- 目前还未知
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

548
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,923
- 告诉我病毒的情况
- 是一种蜘蛛型病毒
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

549
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,660
我们还不了解它的作用
不过有可能会侵害我们的系统
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

550
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,759
- 我们能阻止它吗？
- 每一次我们想消灭它
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

551
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,395
它会变种而躲过
好像不单纯是一种病毒了
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

552
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,564
变成了系统
It's become the system.

553
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,837
很明显，这是大规模反美攻击的第一阶段
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

554
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,536
有此能力的国家包括
The only countries
with this kind of capability

555
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,943
俄罗斯，北朝鲜，也许还有中国
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

556
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,983
- 抱歉，我想事情不是这样的
- 对不起，女士
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

557
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,314
我没留意你在场，你是…？
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

558
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,251
是我侦测到他们的攻击
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

559
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,483
等一下，是你侦测到的？
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

560
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,622
- 她的团队
- 长官，我只是想说明
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

561
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,356
他们在10秒之内就攻破了我们的防火墙
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

562
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,126
就算是最尖端最具攻击性的计算机
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

563
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,963
也需要至少二十年的时间才能做到
would take 20 years to do that.

564
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,537
那么我想请你给我解释
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

565
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,970
北朝鲜加倍了他们的国防？
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

566
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,566
也许这只是他们的防护措施？
我们不是也一样？
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

567
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,044
信号图像正在不断发展
他们具有自发进化的能力
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

568
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,411
这不是傅立叶变换（线性变换）
所能解释的了
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

569
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,711
已经提升到量子力学的范畴
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

570
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,151
在这个地球上并不存在如此复杂的东西
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

571
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,746
那么有机体呢？
具有生命能力的有机体
What about an organism?
A living organism?

572
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,257
例如DNA构成的计算机？
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

573
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,023
- 我知道这个听起来是天方夜谭…
- 够了，够了
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

574
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,057
我们拥有六层楼的同仁
在协力分析调查这个
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

575
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,498
如果你能找到证据来支持你的观点
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

576
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,093
我乐意听取
可是如果你继续在这里信口开河
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

577
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,141
就请你走人，听清楚了？
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

578
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,050
我当时非常清醒，简直“至清无鱼”
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

579
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,318
- 他就那么站起来了
- 站了起来
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

580
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,551
哇...好恐怖哦
Wow. That's really neat.

581
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,786
好吧，这个拿去
Okay, chiefie.

582
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,957
把这个灌满，别滴的到处都是
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

583
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,862
你嗑的什么药？
What are you rolling?

584
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
氧化亚氮（笑气）？巴比妥？
还是少许大麻？
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

585
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,767
- 我没有嗑药
- 这是什么？
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

586
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,368
你口袋里找到的，“魔咒”
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

587
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,235
你们小孩现在流行吃这个？
“魔咒”？
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

588
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,973
- 那是我狗狗的止痛药
- 吉娃娃…
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

589
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,213
怎么回事？
What was that?

590
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,051
你是盯着我的枪呢，想当"50分"？
[美国饶舌歌星 曾中9枪而不死]
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

591
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,683
想试试？那你就动一下试试！
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

592
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,993
不过我告诉你，我一定会让你开花
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

593
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,629
你是不是嗑药了？
Are you on drugs?

736
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,017

I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,173
听我说！
Listen to me!

748
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,152
感谢上帝，你在这里！
我从没这么惨过！
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

749
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,917
我骑着我妈的自行车
被一路追踪到这里
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

750
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,619
我的车就在那儿
它一路追着我到这里！
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

751
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:04,190
下车啊！不！停下！
啊，上帝，好吧，好吧，够了！
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

752
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:08,994
够了！对不起！我…
我没想碰你的车！
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

753
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:14,175
好的，听着，停下，停下！
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

754
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,112
求你了，你想要什么？
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?

755
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:24,852
好的
Okay.

756
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,861
啊，上帝，不，不！
Oh, God, no! No!

757
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:39,235
啊，该死，啊，该死！
上帝，该死！
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

758
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,035
真是噩梦！
It's a bad dream.

759
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,672
你的用户名是不是“万人迷先生217”？
Are you username LadiesMan217?

760
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,938
你在说什么？
I don't know what you're talking about!

761
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,412
你的用户名是不是“万人迷先生217”？
Are you username LadiesMan217?

762
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,641
是啊
Yeah.

763
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,183
你在易趣的拍卖物品24153在哪？
Where is eBay item 21153?

764
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,980
眼镜在哪？
Where are the glasses?

765
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,827
退后！
Get back!

766
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,701
住手！
Stop!

767
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:15,805
上帝！
God!

768
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,469
你怎么了，山姆？
What is your problem, Sam?

769
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,566
那里有个怪物，刚刚袭击了我！
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

770
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:25,114
又来了，快起来
起来快跑，你快跑
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

771
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,813
山姆，那个是什么？
Sam, what is that thing?

772
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,289
- 你快上车，上车
- 我可不想
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

773
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,485
- 上车，相信我，相信我！
- 山姆
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

774
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,963
上车，快，快，快！
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

775
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,908
快，快，快！
Go, go, go, go!

776
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,313
啊，上帝，我们要死了
我们要死了！
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

777
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,976
不，不会的，我们不会死
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

778
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,384
- 啊，上帝！
- 相信我，他很厉害！
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

779
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,421
啊，我的天，不！
Oh, my God! No!

780
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,821
我们要死了！
We're gonna die!

781
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,230
啊，我的天！
Oh, my God!

782
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,776
我们被锁在里面了
We're locked in.

783
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,723
车也无法发动
至少我们躲开了怪物，对吧？
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

784
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,722
Okay.

785
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,765
时机到了
Time to start.

786
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,428
他要抓住我了，上帝
He's got me! Oh, God!

787
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,838
他会杀了我的！
He's going to kill me!

788
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,639
不，不，不！
No. No, no, no!

789
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,421
下来！
Get off!

790
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,100
杀了它！杀了它！
Kill it! Kill it!

791
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,769
抓住它，抓住它，抓住它
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

792
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,587
没了头就不行了吧？
Not so tough without a head, are you?

793
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,993
来，过来
Here, come on.

794
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,310
这是什么？
What is it?

795
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,146
是机器人
It's a robot.

796
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,846
但是像…
But like a...

797
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,476
是另一种…
超级先进的机器人
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

798
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,288
大概是日本机器人
It's probably Japanese.

799
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,790
对，肯定是日本的
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

800
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,089
你现在怎么办？
What are you doing?

801
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,893
如果他要伤害我们，一定一早就动手了
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

802
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,298
真的吗？你会讲机器人语吗？
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

803
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,803
因为他们俩刚刚进行了一场生死决斗
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

804
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,337
- 我觉得我有他要的东西
- 什么？
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

805
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,935
因为另外一个跟我提过我的易趣网页
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

806
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,578
你真是我见过的最无厘头的人
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

807
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,245
- 你会说话吗？
- 卫星收音机
- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...

808
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,914
数字广播系统…哥伦比亚广播系统…
Digital cable brings you...
...Columbia Broadcasting System...

809
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,786
你是通过广播讲话？
So you... You talk through the radio?

810
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,792
谢谢你，你很漂亮
你太棒了，太棒了
Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.

811
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,885
那...昨晚是怎么回事？
那是什么？
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

812
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:10,624
来自浩渺宇宙的…
星河舰队长官的讯息…
Message from Starfleet, Captain...

813
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,624
Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...

814
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,702
太空访客会如天使般成群降临，哈利路亚！
Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!

815
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,929
太空访客？什么…
Visitors from heaven? What...

816
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,165
你是什么，是外星人还是…？
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

817
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,470
还有别的问题吗？
Any more questions you want to ask?

818
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,310
他要我们上车
He wants us to get in the car.

819
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,819
可是去哪儿呢？
And go where?

820
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,584
50年之后，当你回望今生
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

821
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,783
你想后悔没胆上这辆车吗？
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

822
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,985
这车是个不错的司机呢
This car's a pretty good driver.

823
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,251
我知道
I know.

824
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,896
你为什么不坐在驾驶位上？
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

825
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,191
我才不要坐那，他在开呢
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

826
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,357
嗯
Yeah.

827
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,269
你说得对
You're right.

828
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,774
- 要么你坐在我膝盖上？
- 为什么？
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

829
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,708
这里只有一个安全带，安全第一嘛
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

830
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,180
- 嗯，好吧
- 行吗？
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

831
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,841
- Yeah.
- Okay.

832
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,311
看，好多了吧
There, see? That's better.

833
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,021
- Okay.
- Okay.

834
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,094
你这个“安全带”之计还使得蛮圆滑嘛
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

835
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,132
谢谢
Thank you.

836
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,328
其实我想不通
You know what I don't understand?

837
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,496
他既然是个超级先进的机器人
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

838
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,200
为什么还要变回这么一坨烂车？
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

839
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,940
哇！哇！
Whoa! Whoa!

840
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,809
你看，这样不行，看见没？
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

841
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:05,972
开走！你个混蛋！
Move it, you moron!

842
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,107
这下好了…看见没？
Great, now... See?

843
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,645
太妙了
Fantastic.

844
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,618
你把他气跑了
Now you pissed him off.

845
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,389
这个车很敏感的
That car is sensitive.

846
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,686
我的4000美金就这么跑了
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

847
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,931
啊？
What?

848
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,069
这是你…
This is you...

849
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,110
啊，我的天！
Oh, my God!

850
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,048
上来，我们走
Come on, let's go.

851
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,157
这是我见过最酷的事情
到处都在爆炸！
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

852
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,721
比《世界末日》劲爆一百倍！
我对天发誓！
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!

853
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,061
着火了，着火了！
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

854
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,676
啊，天！
Whoa! Sweet!

855
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,911
啊，老弟，我希望这家伙交了陨石险
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

856
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,282
因为他太惨了！
'cause he is so boned!

857
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,523
那是什么？
What is that?

858
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,652
树上有东西，伙计
There's something in the tree, dude.

859
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,889
不，树旁有什么东西！
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

860
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,329
你们能给我一块陨石吗？
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

861
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,225
对不起，请问你是不是牙仙？
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

862
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,838
宝贝，你怎么一个人在这儿！
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

863
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,432
我的天哪！游泳池怎么了！
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

864
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,168
你是不是山姆・詹姆斯・维特维奇
阿切邦・维特维奇的后代？
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

865
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,223
他们知道你的名字
They know your name.

866
01:03:00,224 --> 01:03:01,105
他们知道你的名字

867
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,105
They know your name.

868
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,011
嗯
Yeah.

869
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,546
我叫擎天柱
My name is Optimus Prime.

870
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:09,709
我们是来自塞伯坦星球的机械生命体
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

871
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:13,186
- 也可以简称为汽车人
- 汽车人
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

872
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:18,656
- 什么是“超辣的辣妹”？
- 这是我的副手，爵士
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

873
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:22,288
看来这地方挺有型
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

874
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,730
你哪里学来的这种调子？
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

875
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:28,429
我们从互联网上学到地球人的语言
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

876
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,407
这是我的武器专家，铁皮
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

877
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,870
- 今天你感到好运降身吗，小子？
- 别吓人了，铁皮
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

878
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,210
开玩笑啦，只是想给他秀一下我的大炮
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

879
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,611
我们的医学专家，救护车
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

880
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:47,849
你身上的激素水平
显示你想跟这位女士亲热
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

881
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,592
这位是你的守护者
你已经认识了，大黄蜂
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

882
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,491
大黄蜂，对吧？
Bumblebee, right?

883
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,293
检测系统
嗯，挺好的
Check on the rep
Yep, second to none

884
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,766
你就是我的守护者，哈？
So you're my guardian, huh?

885
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:05,068
他的发声系统在战斗受到破坏
我在想办法把他治好
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

886
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,277
你们为什么在这里？
Why are you here?

887
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:16,613
我们是来找火种源的
而且我们一定要先威震天一步找到他
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

888
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,386
威什么？
Mega-what?

889
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:33,561
我们的星球曾是一个强大的帝国
平静祥和
Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,

890
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:39,472
直到有一天，霸天虎的首领
威震天出卖了我们
until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

891
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,841
不服从他们的势力都被消灭
All who defied them were destroyed.

892
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:50,044
而我们的星球也在战争中消逝殆尽
火种源也消失在星际之间
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.

893
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:57,016
威震天尾随它来到地球
正是在那里维特维奇船长发现了他
Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.

894
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,889
我的曾祖父
My grandfather.

895
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:04,194
那是一个意外
却把我们的命运纠缠在一起
It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.

896
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,961
回来！
Come back!

897
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,067
他好像找到了什么
I think the dogs have found something.

898
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,907
冰面开裂了！
The ice is cracking!

899
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,315
船长！抓住绳子，船长！
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

900
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,050
我没事，伙计们！
I'm all right, lads!

901
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,857
要给你扔条绳子吗，船长？
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

902
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:48,336
威震天在拿到能量体之前
坠落到地球上了
Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.

903
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:55,372
伙计们！我们有个重大发现！
Men! We've made a discovery!

904
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,887
他无意中启动了它的导航系统
He accidentally activated
his navigation system.

905
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:19,305
能量体在地球上的座标
由此印在了他的镜片上
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

906
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,433
你怎么知道眼镜的？
How'd you know about his glasses?

907
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,774
- 易趣网
- 哦，易趣网
- EBay.
- EBay.

908
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:27,042
如果霸天虎们找到了火种源
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

909
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:32,985
他们就会用它的能量转换地球上的机器
建立新的军队
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

910
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:36,490
届时人类便会灭亡
And the human race
will be extinguished.

911
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:42,053
山姆・维特维奇
地球的存亡就掌握在你的手上了
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

912
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,236
眼镜还在你那儿吧？
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

913
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:51,237
大西洋上空

914
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,610
这简直就是个能自我修复的装甲
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

915
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:59,075
看看脱壳穿甲弹打的弹孔
直穿而过
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

916
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,075
Melted right through.

917
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,378
穿甲弹是不是可以产生6000度的高温
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

918
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,713
很接近，能烧熔坦克装甲
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

919
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,015
因此他的金属表面一定会在
极高温下有反应
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

920
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,415
- 注意！
- 啊！
- Heads up!
- Oh!

921
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,821
你不是说这鬼东西已经死了吗！
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

922
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,960
捆住他！捆住！
这东西很邪门！
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

923
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,397
好的，联系北方司令部
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

924
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,765
告诉他们我们的有效武器是高温穿甲弹
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

925
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,337
建议所有的直升机都配备这种弹药，去吧！
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

926
01:07:27,572 --> 01:07:29,267
这块你要不要？
You want that piece?

927
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:32,673
马吉，你听我说
我告诉你接下来会怎样
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

928
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,837
等下进来的，肯定有人唱黑脸，有人唱白脸
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

929
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:38,279
别中圈套
所以我才吃这些东西
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

930
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:40,943
他们把吃的放这儿
是要试探你是不是心虚
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

931
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:43,520
如果你不吃，就说明你心虚
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

932
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:47,456
所以我整盘都吃啦，整盘！
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

933
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:48,719
就咱俩
It's me and you.

934
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:51,660
他们进来时，你什么也别说
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

935
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,736
是她干的！是她干的！
她才是你们要抓的人！
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

936
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,474
我只是在家看卡通片
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

937
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:12,573
还有跟我堂弟玩游戏而已
然后她闯了进来
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

938
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:13,651
- 然后…
- 格伦，你个混蛋
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

939
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:15,982
我才不会因为你或任何人去坐牢！
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

940
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:20,786
我这辈子从来没干过坏事！
老兄，我还是个童男呢！
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

941
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:21,859
好吧，那又怎样？
Okay, so what?

942
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,053
是啊，我是从互联网上下载了几千首歌
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

943
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:25,857
可是谁没有呢！
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

944
01:08:25,964 --> 01:08:26,931
- 我发誓！
- 格伦，闭嘴！
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

945
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:30,866
你闭嘴！不要跟我说话！
不要跟我说话，你这个犯罪分子！
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

946
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:35,264
- 啊，给糖甜昏头了我
- 不是，不是他的错
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

947
01:08:35,373 --> 01:08:36,965
她都说了，我能回家了吗？
See? So can I go home now?

948
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,305
- 好吧，我不会了
- 请你，请你听我说
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

949
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:43,108
不管是谁黑了你们的防卫系统
并且下载了一个文件
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

950
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:45,547
应该是跟一个名叫维特维奇的人有关
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

951
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,245
还有一个政府组织，叫做第七区组织
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

952
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,083
请你让我先跟国防部长谈谈
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

953
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:53,487
否则你们很可能跟错误的敌人作战！
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

954
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,425
“不管天上掉了什么，它就落在…”
Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...

955
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:58,120
- 他怎么说？
- 什么？
- What did he say?
- What?

956
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,697
- 他也听到了吗？
- 是，杰克也听到了
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

957
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:02,358
- 他说是什么？
- 他以为是军事实验
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

958
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:03,866
- 简直不知所谓
- 对，我觉得是一架飞机...
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

959
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:11,072
“目前官方尚未发布任何意见…”
Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...

960
01:09:11,176 --> 01:09:12,370
- 嗯！
- 打电话给山姆
- Yeah!
- Call Sam.

961
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:14,035
- 嗯，为什么？
- 15分钟之内他该到家
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

962
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:15,442
我15分钟之内打电话给他
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

963
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:18,072
如果你再等15分钟，那他就晚了
你就得要禁他的足了
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

964
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:19,810
如果他没有晚，我就不能禁他，对吧？
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

965
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,523
你就呆在这儿，知道吗？
I need you to stay here, all right?

966
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,785
你要呆在这儿看着他们
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

967
01:09:27,893 --> 01:09:28,860
- 好的，好的
- 所有的人
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

968
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,949
- 明白了吗？
- 嗯，嗯，嗯
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

969
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:31,028
就5分钟，好吗？
Five minutes, all right?

970
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,699
- 谢谢你走在了入门径上
- 哦，不，爸爸…
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

971
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,767
啊，入门径
对不起，我忘记了
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

972
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:38,495
我现在就打扫干净，好吗？
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

973
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:40,901
- 要知道我给你买了车…
- 嗯
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

974
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:44,669
把你从警察局保释出来
我还打算包了你所有的家务
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

975
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:46,334
- 家务…
- 对啊，生活挺不错嘛，啊？
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

976
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:49,311
生活简直无与伦比，太棒了
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

977
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:51,974
哦，还有垃圾筒
对不起，爸爸，我马上去倒
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

978
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,175
不，不，我不想累坏你
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

979
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:54,752
不，不会的饿，爸爸
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

980
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:56,320
- 我去做
- 如果你那样做，我会很伤心的
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

981
01:09:56,421 --> 01:09:57,786
- 你肯定？我不介意，不介意…
- 我保证…
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

982
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,117
不，不，不，我会去做的
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

983
01:09:59,224 --> 01:10:01,124
我会去倒了垃圾
我还会擦洗烤架
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

984
01:10:01,226 --> 01:10:05,094
我马上就去打扫整个屋子
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

985
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:07,562
- 今晚，现在？
- 对，现在！
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

986
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,633
那…
The...

987
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:14,900
我爱你，爸爸
我此时此刻真是太爱你了
I love you. God, I love you

988
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,900
just so much right now.

989
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,439
你妈妈要我把你关在家呢
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

990
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,065
- 你晚回家三分钟了
- 是吗？
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

991
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,007
哦，你看
你又为我做了一件事，爸爸！
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

992
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:21,476
你真是太好了
because you're such a swell guy.

993
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,706
又一件事，哈？
One more thing, huh?

994
01:10:22,814 --> 01:10:25,874
好了，我爱你，睡个好觉，帅哥！
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

995
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,078
你干嘛？
你这是干嘛？
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

996
01:10:28,219 --> 01:10:31,484
不，注意门径，注意门径！
注意…拜托，拜托，拜托
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

997
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,457
不，等等，不，不！
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

998
01:10:34,559 --> 01:10:36,993
- 对不起，我的错
- 啊，我…你不能…
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

999
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:39,063
你怎么连五分钟…
你怎么连五分钟都等不了？
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

1000
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:41,997
我说了，呆在那儿！呆在那儿！上帝！
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

1001
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:47,261
- 我不是叫你看住他们！
- 好的，你知道吗？
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

1002
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,365
- 他们就是这样急性子啊！
- 太糟糕了，不！
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

1003
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:55,043
魔咒！魔咒！别靠近机器人！
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

1004
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:58,172
- 啊，湿了
- 不，不，不，冷静，冷静！
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

1005
01:10:58,283 --> 01:11:01,047
住手，住手！这是魔咒，是我的宠物
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

1006
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:03,950
他是宠物，明白？
如果你能收起你的武器…
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

1007
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:07,024
- 收起它们，拜托
- 你有只啮齿动物
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

1008
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,319
- 一只什么？
- 要不要摧毁？
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

1009
01:11:08,426 --> 01:11:10,587
不，不，不
它不是啮齿动物，它只是吉娃娃
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

1010
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:13,892
这是我的吉娃娃
我们都爱吉娃娃，对不对？
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

1011
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:16,695
他撒了我满脚润滑剂！
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

1012
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:22,367
- 他在你脚上撒尿？坏魔咒！坏魔咒！
- 坏魔咒！
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

1013
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:23,964
对不起
它只是想表明这是它的领地
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

1014
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,633
仅此而已
That's all it is.

1015
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,542
- 我的脚要生锈了
- 没事的
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1016
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,946
Okay, okay.

1017
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,778
- 闭嘴，去躲起来！
- 快！
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1018
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,547
汽车人，进行侦察
Autobots, recon.

1019
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:44,087
我希望他没事，他正在厨房里
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1020
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,958
在往他的鼻子上敷冰呢
Got some ice on his nose.

1021
01:11:46,064 --> 01:11:48,498
我刚刚小小地教训了他一下
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1022
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,965
你才没有呢
You did not.

1023
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:53,363
- 你甚至没有禁他足
- 差不多，差不多了
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

1024
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,665
他们在哪里？不，不，不
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1025
01:11:58,743 --> 01:12:00,370
拜托，拜托
Come on, come on.

1026
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:08,277
- 什么，这是什么？
- 时间宝贵
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1027
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:10,980
- 他们真的很想要那副眼镜
- 拜托，你在干什么？
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1028
01:12:11,089 --> 01:12:12,750
- 我想要帮你
- 好的
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1029
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,848
- 请快点
- 好的
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1030
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:18,218
- 啊，不，真的不见了
- 怎么会呢？
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

1031
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:19,353
眼镜在袋子里
My glasses were in the bag.

1032
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,295
袋子在我背包里
但背包不在这里
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1033
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:22,957
他们肯定不会高兴的，现在怎么办？
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1034
01:12:23,068 --> 01:12:24,126
我觉得你应该…
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1035
01:12:24,235 --> 01:12:26,430
你应该清查下整个…
这里每个角落
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1036
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:29,473
你帮我仔细找找
我找这边的角落
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1037
01:12:29,574 --> 01:12:32,008
不，不，那里不要，那边是我私人的…
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1038
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,543
- 对不起，没什么
- 你只是…
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1039
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:34,612
- 你只是叫我看…
- 我明白
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

1040
01:12:34,713 --> 01:12:36,078
但我又没叫你翻我的藏宝箱
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1041
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:38,877
你应该讲清楚，不然我又会找错地方…
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1042
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:40,917
我已经都快崩溃了
I'm already stressed out enough.

1043
01:12:41,019 --> 01:12:42,509
又怎么了？
Okay. What now?

1044
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:48,359
不，不，不
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1045
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:52,419
这算什么躲藏？这算什么躲藏？
这里是我家后院，可不是公路休息站
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1046
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,519
啊，上帝，啊！
Oh, God. Oh!

1047
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:57,761
我看到有不明飞行物体在此着陆
但现在不见了
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.

1048
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:00,167
我的摩托还在底下压着，伙计！
谁来赔我钱？
My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?

1049
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:03,368
山姆，山姆？
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1050
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:06,410
- 他又来了
- 我处理不了，我…
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1051
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,103
什么？不，不
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1052
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:09,271
这是我妈的花园
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1053
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,608
听着，听我说
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1054
01:13:10,715 --> 01:13:12,706
如果我父母出来看到了你们
他们会吓坏了的
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1055
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:14,284
我妈脾气很不好
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1056
01:13:14,385 --> 01:13:15,943
我们必须拿到那副眼镜
We must have the glasses.

1057
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:17,612
我知道你需要那副眼镜
我已经找遍所有地方
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1058
01:13:17,722 --> 01:13:19,952
它们不在这里，很明显不在这里
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1059
01:13:20,058 --> 01:13:21,150
继续找
Keep searching.

1060
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:22,920
我要你们安静五分钟
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1061
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,255
或十分钟，好吗？
Ten minutes. Okay?

1062
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:26,125
拜托，我求你们了，你们要…
你们太吵了
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1063
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:28,222
我不能专心
你们要我找，我却听到…
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1064
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:29,357
冷静、冷静
Calm down, calm down.

1065
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:31,162
你得帮帮我
你得帮帮我
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1066
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:33,931
- 汽车人，撤退
- 谢谢你，拜托，就5分钟
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1067
01:13:34,038 --> 01:13:35,903
好吗？好吗？
Good? Good? Okay.

1068
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:37,167
- 行动
- 走开！
- Move!
- Get away!

1069
01:13:37,275 --> 01:13:38,970
你们怎么回事？就不能安静下吗？
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1070
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:40,977
他要我们安静
He wants us to be quiet.

1071
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:48,616
地震了！快跑！地震了！
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1072
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,651
茱蒂，快躲到桌下！快呀！
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1073
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,583
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1074
01:13:50,652 --> 01:13:52,583
茱蒂，快躲到桌下！快呀！

1075
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,521
你怎么那么快就跑到那里？
How did you get over there so fast?

1076
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:57,356
哇！好痒！
Wow! That was tingly!

1077
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:00,863
- 你该试试！
- 嗯，看上去很好玩
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

1078
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:07,728
- 山姆？
- 山姆？
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1079
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:12,837
- 那是什么？
- 我不知道
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1080
01:14:13,678 --> 01:14:15,407
- 山姆？
- 真奇怪…山姆？
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1081
01:14:15,547 --> 01:14:17,242
- 山姆！
- 救护车，打开灯
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

1082
01:14:17,348 --> 01:14:19,908
- 快点
- 听着，这里出了点状况
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1083
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:21,076
开灯干什么，把灯关掉
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1084
01:14:21,186 --> 01:14:23,086
怎么回事？把灯关掉，让他把灯关掉
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1085
01:14:23,188 --> 01:14:24,348
- 关掉
- 山姆，你在里面吗？
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

1086
01:14:24,455 --> 01:14:25,513
为何门是锁着的
How come the door's locked?

1087
01:14:25,623 --> 01:14:29,252
你知道规矩的
不许在这家里锁门
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1088
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,554
你再不开门
You know he'll start counting

1089
01:14:30,662 --> 01:14:32,061
- 他就要开始倒数了！
- 最后一次机会，5…
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1090
01:14:32,163 --> 01:14:33,152
哦，天哪
Oh, dear.

1091
01:14:33,264 --> 01:14:34,993
- 4，打开门铰链
- 他在倒数了！
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

1092
01:14:35,133 --> 01:14:36,498
- 山姆，快开门
- 3
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

1093
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:37,568
- 噢，天啊
- 2
- Oh, my.
- Two.

1094
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:39,728
- 他在倒数
- 退后
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1095
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:43,901
- 怎么了？你拿着球棒干嘛？
- 你刚在跟谁讲话？
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1096
01:14:44,008 --> 01:14:47,000
- 跟你们呀
- 你怎么又臭又脏的？
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1097
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:48,703
我年轻啊，你懂得，青少年
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1098
01:14:48,813 --> 01:14:51,043
我们听到有人声和噪音
我们以为你…
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1099
01:14:51,149 --> 01:14:53,014
我们怎么想不重要
刚才那灯光是什么？
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1100
01:14:53,117 --> 01:14:54,914
不是，什么灯光？啥？
没什么灯光，老爸！没有什么光！
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1101
01:14:55,019 --> 01:14:56,509
你们手上不就有两个手电筒！
光是从你们这里来的
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1102
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:57,883
- 或许就这么反射…
- 光是从门缝里出来的
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1103
01:14:57,989 --> 01:15:00,014
你们…你们不能就这么闯进我的房间里来
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1104
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:01,489
你应该先敲门、先沟通
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1105
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:02,615
- 我们敲了5分钟了
- 我长大了
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1106
01:15:02,727 --> 01:15:04,092
- 我们敲门了
- 你们没有
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1107
01:15:04,195 --> 01:15:05,662
- 你们是在冲我喊，知道吗？
- 没有
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

1108
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:07,196
你们现在是在打压我
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1109
01:15:07,298 --> 01:15:09,664
- 你们在蹂躏我的青春，知道吗？
- 哦，老天啊
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1110
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:14,227
你太过激了
你在手淫吗？
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1111
01:15:16,107 --> 01:15:17,165
- 茱蒂
- 我在...
- Judy.
- Was I...

1112
01:15:17,275 --> 01:15:18,242
- 没有，老妈
- 够了，好吗？
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

1113
01:15:18,343 --> 01:15:19,674
- 没关系的
- 没有，我没有手淫！
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

1114
01:15:19,777 --> 01:15:20,801
那不是你该管的
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1115
01:15:20,912 --> 01:15:22,436
- 那是父子间的对话，好不好？
- 父与子的私事
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

1116
01:15:22,547 --> 01:15:25,380
我是说如果你不喜欢这个词的话
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1117
01:15:25,483 --> 01:15:29,112
你可以称它为“山姆的快乐时间”
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1118
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,211
- 快乐时间？
- 或“我特别的私人时间”
- Happy time?
...my special alone time...

1119
01:15:31,322 --> 01:15:32,289
- 别说了
- 老妈
- Stop.
- Mom.

1120
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:33,379
- 茱蒂，别说了
- …个人时间…
- Judy, stop.
...with myself.

1121
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:34,515
- 老妈，你不能就这么进来
- 对不起
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

1122
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:36,924
今晚有点不自在，我稍微喝了点酒
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1123
01:15:37,028 --> 01:15:39,053
- 不要，老爸
- 好了，我们的确看到光的.
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1124
01:15:39,163 --> 01:15:40,926
哦，父母来了
Oh, parents.

1125
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,631
我不知道在哪儿，但我的确看到了！
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1126
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:49,331
地震！又来了！又是地震！回到走廊里！
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1127
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,709
- 好的！
- 余震！余震！
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1128
01:15:51,709 --> 01:15:52,073
- 好的！
- 余震！余震！
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1129
01:15:52,176 --> 01:15:53,165
哦，我不喜欢地震
Oh, I hate these.

1130
01:15:53,278 --> 01:15:54,540
- 安全第一，安全第一！
- 快，藏起来
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

1131
01:15:54,646 --> 01:15:55,670
- 嘿，来电了
- 藏起来？什么？
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

1132
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,304
- 藏哪儿？
- 拜托，从浴缸里出来吧
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

1133
01:15:57,415 --> 01:15:58,746
你不觉得保命很重要的？
Can't you take safety seriously?

1134
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:02,115
- 要命，这地板真脏，山姆
- 哦，该死！该死！
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1135
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,121
噢，不！你看院子，都毁了
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1136
01:16:10,228 --> 01:16:13,720
茱蒂，打给电力局
变压器好像爆了
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1137
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:16,322
电杆火星四射…天哪
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1138
01:16:16,434 --> 01:16:18,664
院子被毁了
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1139
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:20,465
一塌糊涂，完了
Trashed. Gone.

1140
01:16:20,772 --> 01:16:22,239
- 成洼地了，整个花园
- 你开玩笑
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1141
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,365
这对父母很烦人
The parents are very irritating.

1142
01:16:24,475 --> 01:16:26,170
- 是啊，是啊
- 我能不能处理掉他们？
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

1143
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:29,007
铁皮，你知道我们不能伤害人类的
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1144
01:16:29,113 --> 01:16:30,307
你在想什么？
What is with you?

1145
01:16:30,415 --> 01:16:33,748
我只是说我们是可以
只是一个方案
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1146
01:16:33,851 --> 01:16:35,512
我们听到你和别人在说话，山姆
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

1147
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:38,020
- 到底是何谁？
- 老妈，我说了…
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

1148
01:16:38,122 --> 01:16:39,919
你好，我是梅卡拉
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1149
01:16:40,692 --> 01:16:42,956
我是山姆的朋友
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1150
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:47,159
天啊，你真漂亮
美若天仙，不是吗？
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1151
01:16:47,265 --> 01:16:50,132
- 她听得到你说话，妈
- 谢谢你
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

1152
01:16:50,234 --> 01:16:53,294
天啊！真抱歉让你听到我们的家庭讨论…
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1153
01:16:53,404 --> 01:16:54,894
- 抱歉打扰你们了
- 妈，我的背包呢？
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1154
01:16:55,006 --> 01:16:56,166
- 来，亲爱的，我们走
- 哦，在厨房里
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1155
01:17:13,524 --> 01:17:16,857
哦，太好了
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1156
01:17:16,961 --> 01:17:18,952
你妈人真好
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1157
01:17:19,063 --> 01:17:20,030
你帮我分散我父母的注意
I want you to distract my parents

1158
01:17:20,131 --> 01:17:22,429
我就能溜出去把眼镜交给他们，好吗？
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

1159
01:17:28,373 --> 01:17:30,933
- 罗纳德・维奇提？
- 是维特维奇，你是谁？
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1160
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:33,067
我们是政府机关，第七区的
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1161
01:17:33,177 --> 01:17:35,304
- 从来没听过
- 以后也不会
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1162
01:17:35,413 --> 01:17:37,938
你儿子是阿奇巴尔德・维奇提的曾孙子
对不对？
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1163
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:39,175
是维特维奇
It's Witwicky.

1164
01:17:39,283 --> 01:17:42,514
我能进屋吗，先生？
May I enter the premises, sir?

1165
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,555
荣恩，前院有好多人
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1166
01:17:45,656 --> 01:17:46,623
到底是怎么回事？
What the heck is going on here?

1167
01:17:46,724 --> 01:17:48,851
你儿子昨晚举报有人偷车
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1168
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,224
我们认为这关系到国家的安全
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1169
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:52,762
- 他们在拔我的玫瑰！
- 国家安全？
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1170
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:53,922
没错，国家安全
That's right. National security.

1171
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:55,624
天哪，荣恩，到处都是他们的人
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1172
01:17:55,733 --> 01:17:58,099
到处都是穿西装的！看呀！
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1173
01:17:58,202 --> 01:17:59,999
可不可以别踩我的草坪
Could you stay off the grass?

1174
01:18:00,104 --> 01:18:01,537
给我采取一些同位素的样本
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1175
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:03,266
他们把树都拔了！
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1176
01:18:03,374 --> 01:18:06,605
老天！不许他们碰我的花！
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1177
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:08,178
- 请放下你的球棒，女士
- 喂喂喂，那是我的…
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1178
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:09,610
我可是带着武器的
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1179
01:18:09,714 --> 01:18:11,045
你最好叫你的人离开我的花园
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1180
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,310
否则我会狠狠修理他们
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1181
01:18:13,418 --> 01:18:16,444
你是否有流感的症状？
关节疼痛，发烧？
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1182
01:18:16,554 --> 01:18:18,613
- 没有
- 怎么回事？
- No!
- What is this?

1183
01:18:18,723 --> 01:18:21,453
你好呀，小子
你叫山姆吗？
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

1184
01:18:21,559 --> 01:18:23,026
- 是啊
- 那你得跟我们走一趟
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

1185
01:18:23,127 --> 01:18:24,355
喂，那可不行
Whoa, way out of line.

1186
01:18:24,462 --> 01:18:28,489
先生，我这已经很客气了
退下
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1187
01:18:28,599 --> 01:18:30,499
- 你不能带我儿子走
- 是吗？
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1188
01:18:30,601 --> 01:18:31,659
想和我们硬碰硬？
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1189
01:18:31,769 --> 01:18:32,963
不，但我会打电话报警
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1190
01:18:33,071 --> 01:18:35,266
这件事太点蹊跷
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1191
01:18:35,373 --> 01:18:38,069
没错，你，你儿子…
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

1192
01:18:38,176 --> 01:18:42,135
还有扣皮带的狗，整个组织都有蹊跷
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1193
01:18:42,246 --> 01:18:44,476
- 什么组织？
- 我们接下来就知道了
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1194
01:18:44,582 --> 01:18:47,142
我认为是直接接触
I think direct contact.

1195
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:54,148
- 孩子
- 嗯
- Son?
- Yeah.

1196
01:18:55,226 --> 01:18:58,127
- 请上前来
- 站着就行？
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

1197
01:19:03,901 --> 01:19:05,368
14单位
Fourteen rads.

1198
01:19:06,971 --> 01:19:08,438
找对人了！
把他们贴上标签卷走
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1199
01:19:09,173 --> 01:19:11,073
你敢伤我的狗，我就揣你屁股
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1200
01:19:11,175 --> 01:19:12,870
尽快取得植被上的样本
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1201
01:19:12,977 --> 01:19:14,501
山姆，不要开口
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1202
01:19:14,612 --> 01:19:16,477
- 好的
- 在律师来前一个字都别说！
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1203
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:21,911
好了
So,

1204
01:19:23,354 --> 01:19:26,812
万人迷先生217
LadiesMan217.

1205
01:19:26,924 --> 01:19:30,360
那是你的易趣帐号名称，对吧
That is your eBay username, right?

1206
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:32,793
对，我打错字了
不过就将错就错
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1207
01:19:32,897 --> 01:19:33,864
那这是什么？
What do you make of this?

1208
01:19:33,965 --> 01:19:36,525
我叫山姆・维特维奇， 知道吗？
我的车…
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...

1209
01:19:36,634 --> 01:19:37,760
那是你吗？
Is that you?

1210
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:40,064
是啊，那听起来像万人迷先生
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1211
01:19:40,171 --> 01:19:45,006
昨晚在警局你说你的车变形了
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1212
01:19:46,344 --> 01:19:48,676
- 能不能解释一下
- 你听我说，好吗？
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

1213
01:19:48,779 --> 01:19:53,239
我车被偷的这一切都是个误会
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1214
01:19:53,351 --> 01:19:55,478
- 是吗？
- …从我手上，从家里…
- Really?
...from me, from my home,

1215
01:19:55,586 --> 01:19:58,555
但现在没事了，因为它回来了
已经回来了
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1216
01:19:58,656 --> 01:20:00,385
- 不是自己回来的
- 当然不是
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1217
01:20:00,491 --> 01:20:03,927
因为车子不会自己回来
因为那太荒唐了！
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1218
01:20:07,064 --> 01:20:08,656
真好笑，好笑
That's funny. That is so funny.

1219
01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:11,257
你们两个对外星人了解多少？
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1220
01:20:12,436 --> 01:20:15,200
你说火星人？ET？ 不知道
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T? No.

1221
01:20:15,306 --> 01:20:16,796
- 那只是个传说
- 是啊
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1222
01:20:16,908 --> 01:20:18,034
知道这是什么吗？
You see this?

1223
01:20:18,142 --> 01:20:20,736
有了这个徽章，我就可以为所欲为
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1224
01:20:20,845 --> 01:20:23,609
- 这样
- 我要把你们永远关起来
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1225
01:20:23,714 --> 01:20:24,942
哦，老天，我告诉你，别听他的
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1226
01:20:25,049 --> 01:20:27,449
他生气是因为他回去后
就得去作购物中心的保安
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1227
01:20:27,552 --> 01:20:30,612
你这穿着运动胸罩的，别惹我
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1228
01:20:30,721 --> 01:20:32,814
尤其你爸的假释期快到了
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1229
01:20:32,924 --> 01:20:34,323
什么？假释期？
What? Parole?

1230
01:20:34,425 --> 01:20:37,758
- 没什么…
- 哦，偷车大盗不算什么？
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1231
01:20:37,862 --> 01:20:39,853
你知道我爸以前教我修的车…
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1232
01:20:39,964 --> 01:20:41,693
那些…不全是他的
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1233
01:20:41,799 --> 01:20:42,891
你们偷车？
You stole cars?

1234
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,695
我们有时请不起保姆
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1235
01:20:44,802 --> 01:20:46,599
那时他就会带我一起去
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1236
01:20:46,704 --> 01:20:49,002
她也有少年犯罪前科
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1237
01:20:49,106 --> 01:20:51,734
她是个罪犯！罪犯真性感！
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1238
01:20:52,877 --> 01:20:57,507
因为你不合作而让他
下半辈子待在监狱不太好吧？
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1239
01:20:57,615 --> 01:20:59,913
该说实话了
It is time to talk!

1240
01:21:06,657 --> 01:21:08,090
好大
Big! It's big!

1241
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,798
快，快，快，快！
Go, go, go, go!

1242
01:21:15,233 --> 01:21:17,861
- 我看不到！我看不到！
- 你们把重心朝前！
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1243
01:21:17,969 --> 01:21:19,402
够了！够了！
All right! All right!

1244
01:21:33,985 --> 01:21:36,283
你们这群废柴有麻烦了
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1245
01:21:36,387 --> 01:21:38,917
先生们，让我向你们介绍
我的朋友…
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1246
01:21:39,982 --> 01:21:42,882
擎天柱

1247
01:21:45,162 --> 01:21:48,928
带走这些孩子是错误的选择
Taking the children was a bad move.

1248
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:52,434
汽车人，卸下他们的武器
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1249
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,769
不要动！
Freeze!

1250
01:21:58,409 --> 01:21:59,808
拿来吧
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1251
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:00,968
Whoa!

1252
01:22:02,413 --> 01:22:03,471
Whoa!

1253
01:22:14,258 --> 01:22:15,589
你好
Hi, there.

1254
01:22:15,893 --> 01:22:20,626
你好像不怕我们
难道你们看到我们不觉得惊讶吗？
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1255
01:22:21,332 --> 01:22:26,269
第七区有规定，知道吗？
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1256
01:22:26,871 --> 01:22:28,168
我不允许和你交流
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1257
01:22:28,272 --> 01:22:30,502
不过除了告诉你“我不能和你交流”
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1258
01:22:30,608 --> 01:22:33,202
- 下车
- 好的
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1259
01:22:33,844 --> 01:22:34,970
- 我？你要我…
- 下车！
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1260
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:36,569
好的好的，下车
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1261
01:22:36,681 --> 01:22:40,048
好了，我在下了，在下了，看到没？
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1262
01:22:40,151 --> 01:22:43,643
能那么放下我们却不让我们受伤，不错
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1263
01:22:43,754 --> 01:22:45,278
你对手铐也很在行吧？
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1264
01:22:45,389 --> 01:22:46,378
你们好吗？
How you doing?

1265
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,219
- 你不应该知道那些的
- 大伙好吗？
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

1266
01:22:48,326 --> 01:22:50,487
- 是啊
- 这都是真的
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1267
01:22:50,594 --> 01:22:53,757
听好，如果我准备和他开战
“妈妈”就是密语，知道吗？
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

1268
01:22:53,864 --> 01:22:57,630
山姆，我那前科是因为我不肯供出我爸
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1269
01:22:58,235 --> 01:23:02,399
在你完美的人生里
有过不得不作出牺牲的时候吗
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1270
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:05,635
大家伙，拿大炮的大家伙，嗯？
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1271
01:23:05,743 --> 01:23:08,610
第七区是什么，回答我
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1272
01:23:08,713 --> 01:23:11,204
这里有权利发问的是我
不是你，小伙子！
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

1273
01:23:11,315 --> 01:23:13,545
- 你怎么知道外星人的事？
- 你把我父母带到哪去了？
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1274
01:23:13,651 --> 01:23:15,642
- 我无权和你们讨论这些
- 是吗？
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1275
01:23:15,753 --> 01:23:17,618
你碰我的话会触了联邦法
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1276
01:23:17,722 --> 01:23:19,451
为所欲为的徽章，是吗？
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1277
01:23:19,557 --> 01:23:22,390
你现在有这些外星人做靠山就大胆起来了
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1278
01:23:22,493 --> 01:23:25,690
- 第七区在哪儿？
- 你们不想知道？
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1279
01:23:30,968 --> 01:23:31,935
喂！
Hey!

1280
01:23:32,036 --> 01:23:34,971
大黄蜂，停止润滑他
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1281
01:23:35,072 --> 01:23:37,131
别闹了，好不好？
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1282
01:23:38,476 --> 01:23:41,775
- 好了，猛男，开始脱吧
- 什么意思？
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1283
01:23:41,879 --> 01:23:44,575
- 你的衣服，全脱了
- 为什么？
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

1284
01:23:45,816 --> 01:23:47,647
因为你威胁我爸
For threatening my dad.

1285
01:23:50,721 --> 01:23:56,626
小姑娘，这是你生命终结的序曲
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1286
01:23:58,396 --> 01:24:00,057
你是个罪犯
You're a criminal.

1287
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:03,529
面对现实吧，上梁不正下梁歪
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1288
01:24:05,002 --> 01:24:07,835
不错啊
站到路灯后面
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1289
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:08,927
知道了
All right.

1290
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:11,132
你们这样做犯了很严重的罪
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1291
01:24:13,177 --> 01:24:15,077
- 我会抓到你的
- 他抓到你的
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

1292
01:24:15,212 --> 01:24:17,373
- 不会心软的
- 不会
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1293
01:24:17,481 --> 01:24:18,743
- 呆这吧
- 好了？
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1294
01:24:18,849 --> 01:24:23,286
- 我们必须通知所有人
- 他们已经知道了，扩音器模式
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1295
01:24:29,827 --> 01:24:31,761
擎天柱！敌人入侵！
Optimus! Incoming!

1296
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:40,698
出发
Roll out.

1297
01:24:47,611 --> 01:24:50,944
我在那桥下测出有辐射反映
Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.

1298
01:24:53,818 --> 01:24:57,219
辐射反映很强，超过42个单位
Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.

1299
01:24:57,321 --> 01:24:58,652
上来
Up you get.

1300
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,328
好了，我们要行动了
Okay, we're dropping in.

1301
01:25:09,366 --> 01:25:11,960
我们下方辐射指数很高
他在那儿
Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.

1302
01:25:12,069 --> 01:25:14,230
1号和2号船，到这儿来
Ship one and two, come on in.

1303
01:25:15,306 --> 01:25:17,934
看到了，在那儿
锁定他，锁定他
That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.

1304
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:21,307
他在那儿，正前方偏左，正下方
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.

1305
01:25:21,846 --> 01:25:23,404
看到了，正前方
I got it. 12:00.

1306
01:25:27,485 --> 01:25:28,918
好了，我在跟踪她，找到了
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1307
01:25:31,889 --> 01:25:34,084
他正沿着街道移动
Got him going down the street.

1308
01:25:37,695 --> 01:25:42,257
他去哪儿了？我找不到他
失去红外信号，他去哪儿了？
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?

1309
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,761
信号丢失，信号丢失
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.

1310
01:25:45,336 --> 01:25:47,327
我们这就赶过去
Okay, we're coming around.

1311
01:26:10,027 --> 01:26:11,551
小心点，你们俩
Easy, you two.

1312
01:26:20,938 --> 01:26:24,169
不！不！山姆！山姆！别放手
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1313
01:26:24,842 --> 01:26:27,834
山姆，不要！我在往下滑！
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1314
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:31,138
- 抓住！
- 不要
- Hold on!
- No!

1315
01:26:34,852 --> 01:26:36,080
山姆！
Sam!

1316
01:26:41,692 --> 01:26:44,820
我们找到了他了，目标锁定在河上
All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.

1317
01:26:44,929 --> 01:26:46,191
进入射击范围
I'm in for the shot.

1318
01:26:46,297 --> 01:26:47,730
住手！住手！
Stop! Stop!

1319
01:26:48,933 --> 01:26:50,730
等等！不要！
Wait! No!

1320
01:26:54,104 --> 01:26:56,698
- 射击，抓住他
- 射击
- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.

1321
01:26:57,274 --> 01:26:58,468
不要！
No!

1322
01:27:14,558 --> 01:27:16,651
不要！住手！
No! Stop!

1323
01:27:17,261 --> 01:27:18,558
住手！
Stop!

1324
01:27:19,163 --> 01:27:22,599
趴在地上！趴下！
Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!

1325
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:24,932
什么？好的
What? Okay.

1326
01:27:26,804 --> 01:27:28,965
看啊，他没有还手
Look, he's not fighting back!

1327
01:27:29,573 --> 01:27:31,768
冻住它！冻住它！
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1328
01:27:38,148 --> 01:27:39,706
不要伤害他！
Stop hurting him!

1329
01:27:49,126 --> 01:27:50,821
让他别动！
Don't let him move!

1330
01:27:51,562 --> 01:27:53,120
我抓住他了
I got him here!

1331
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,378
不要！
No!

1332
01:28:21,392 --> 01:28:23,189
看到我开不开心？
Happy to see me again?

1333
01:28:24,695 --> 01:28:27,425
把他和他的罪犯朋友关到车子里
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1334
01:28:33,303 --> 01:28:36,363
把那东西冷冻起来准备运送
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1335
01:28:44,548 --> 01:28:46,812
退后，我去侦查一下
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1336
01:28:49,653 --> 01:28:51,052
擎天柱
Optimus,

1337
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:55,858
我们就待在这儿什么都不做？
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1338
01:28:55,959 --> 01:28:59,656
我们没办法为救大黄蜂而不伤害人类
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1339
01:28:59,763 --> 01:29:02,561
- 但这成何体统，他…
- 让他们走吧
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1340
01:29:14,578 --> 01:29:18,173
中国和俄国
非常接近我们的西太平洋作战区
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1341
01:29:17,047 --> 01:29:18,173
in the western Pacific.

1342
01:29:18,282 --> 01:29:20,477
这局势我们控制不了多久
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1343
01:29:20,584 --> 01:29:23,348
接下来数小时就看他们总统怎么做了
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1344
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:31,998
有中国特遣舰队已经接近
巡弋飞弹射程100哩内
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1345
01:29:30,661 --> 01:29:31,992
of cruise missile range.

1346
01:29:32,096 --> 01:29:35,623
告诉航母指挥官
除非对方先进攻，否则不要攻击
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1347
01:29:35,733 --> 01:29:37,701
- 是的，长官
- 部长先生？
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

1348
01:29:40,104 --> 01:29:45,167
我是第七区先进研究部的汤姆・班奈杰克
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1349
01:29:45,275 --> 01:29:48,472
从没听说过
我现在很忙，汤姆，我想你也看得出来
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

1350
01:29:51,615 --> 01:29:54,106
- 怎么回事？
- 不知道
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1351
01:29:57,755 --> 01:30:00,417
情况通报员！出来说句话！
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1352
01:30:00,524 --> 01:30:02,924
- 整间作业都中断了，先生
- 我知道！
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

1353
01:30:03,026 --> 01:30:04,687
病毒是用来中断所有作业的
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1354
01:30:04,795 --> 01:30:07,229
- 将军？
- 我坐在那里等
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1355
01:30:08,265 --> 01:30:09,232
中止作业是什么意思？
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1356
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:12,325
它们利用我们网站把病毒散布出去
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1357
01:30:12,436 --> 01:30:13,528
全球性的网络
The blackout's global.

1358
01:30:13,637 --> 01:30:16,470
我们与全球的卫星、固网联络都中断了
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1359
01:30:16,573 --> 01:30:21,101
你是说我无法用这台电话打给我家？
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1360
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:31,350
部长先生，我是奉总统之命而来
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1361
01:30:33,357 --> 01:30:35,723
你需要看看我这手提箱里的东西
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1362
01:30:38,796 --> 01:30:40,354
你必须知道有些事情
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1363
01:30:40,464 --> 01:30:42,557
你无法立即了解
you won't understand right away.

1364
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:45,999
第七区是政府内一个特殊部门
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1365
01:30:46,103 --> 01:30:49,504
80年前奉胡佛总统之密令成立
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1366
01:30:50,374 --> 01:30:54,470
您可能记得太空总署和喷推实验室
在火星上损失了猎犬二号机器人
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1367
01:30:55,579 --> 01:30:59,845
我们告诉他们将整件任务宣告失败，其实不然
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1368
01:31:00,317 --> 01:31:02,717
猎犬二号传输了十三秒钟的影像
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1369
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,845
这是比最高机密还要机密的
This was classified above top secret.

1370
01:31:20,838 --> 01:31:23,466
电子活动在170小时48分后停止
EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.

1371
01:31:23,574 --> 01:31:26,202
火星上不是只有石头
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1372
01:31:27,477 --> 01:31:29,570
这是火星上传来的影像
This is the image from Mars.

1373
01:31:30,414 --> 01:31:35,046
这是您的特种部队
在基地被袭击时拍得的影像
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1374
01:31:33,283 --> 01:31:35,046
from the base attack.

1375
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:38,913
我们相信这是相同的外骨骼结构
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1376
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:42,554
很显然地并非俄国或北朝鲜能有的
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1377
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,622
你是说外星入侵？
Are we talking about an invasion?

1378
01:31:45,729 --> 01:31:48,823
我们拦劫了您的特种部队传来的讯息
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1379
01:31:48,932 --> 01:31:52,265
那些东西知道他们也能被我方武器损伤的
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1380
01:31:52,369 --> 01:31:54,098
所以他们用病毒使军事指挥陷入瘫痪
That's why the virus shut us down,

1381
01:31:54,204 --> 01:31:57,503
好让我们无法组织防备他们下一波攻击
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1382
01:31:57,608 --> 01:32:02,102
我敢用我的政府薪金打赌
下一波攻击绝对会很快来临
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1383
01:32:05,983 --> 01:32:08,315
用国民警卫队的频道通知舰队指挥官
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1384
01:32:08,418 --> 01:32:11,819
那是短波，可能还有作用
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1385
01:32:11,922 --> 01:32:15,255
叫他们调转船头，迅速赶回来
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1386
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,328
通知各司令部，抵抗即将发生的攻击
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1387
01:32:19,538 --> 01:32:22,803
内利斯空军基地

1388
01:32:28,538 --> 01:32:31,803
兰诺斯上尉，请带你的部队跟我们来！
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1389
01:32:31,909 --> 01:32:32,876
我们走！
Let's go!

1390
01:32:37,915 --> 01:32:39,405
她在这里
She's in here.

1391
01:32:39,783 --> 01:32:41,444
怎么回事？
What's going on?

1392
01:32:41,985 --> 01:32:43,816
你跟我来
You're coming with me.

1393
01:32:44,254 --> 01:32:46,950
- 你来做我的顾问
- 我也要去？
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?

1394
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,289
他是谁？
Who's this?

1395
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:53,154
- 他是我的顾问
- 那他也来
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.

1396
01:33:04,441 --> 01:33:06,932
- 那么…
- 他们要你们来做什么？
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1397
01:33:08,011 --> 01:33:12,277
我买了辆车…结果是个外星机器人
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1398
01:33:12,382 --> 01:33:13,349
Wow.

1399
01:33:14,017 --> 01:33:15,143
谁知道呢
Who knew?

1400
01:33:31,935 --> 01:33:33,835
走直线！小心你身后！
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1401
01:33:44,648 --> 01:33:47,378
拜托，希望有用
Please, let this work.

1402
01:33:48,785 --> 01:33:50,685
启动吧，老大
Fire it up, Optimus.

1403
01:33:51,655 --> 01:33:53,145
代码
The code.

1404
01:33:53,256 --> 01:33:58,660
眼镜里的代码显示火种源
在离这里230哩远处
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1405
01:34:00,464 --> 01:34:04,264
我感觉到霸天虎已准备开始行动了
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1406
01:34:05,435 --> 01:34:07,198
他们一定也知道火种源在这里
They must know it's here, as well.

1407
01:34:07,304 --> 01:34:08,635
大黄蜂怎么办？
What about Bumblebee?

1408
01:34:08,739 --> 01:34:12,800
我们不能就这么眼睁睁的被他们当作试验品
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1409
01:34:12,909 --> 01:34:16,902
如果我们不完成任务的话他的牺牲就白费了
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1410
01:34:17,014 --> 01:34:21,246
大黄峰是名勇敢的战士
这会是他所希望的
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1411
01:34:21,351 --> 01:34:24,286
为何我们为拯救人类而战？
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1412
01:34:25,689 --> 01:34:29,056
他们是个原始且残暴的种族
They're a primitive and violent race.

1413
01:34:31,395 --> 01:34:33,386
我们以前不也是吗？
Were we so different?

1414
01:34:34,297 --> 01:34:38,666
他们是个年轻的种族
还有很多要学
They're a young species.
They have much to learn.

1415
01:34:38,769 --> 01:34:41,567
但我看到过他们的优点
But I've seen goodness in them.

1416
01:34:41,671 --> 01:34:45,835
自由是所有有情感的生物之希望
Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.

1417
01:34:45,942 --> 01:34:50,174
你们都知道结束这战争只有一个方法
You all know there's only one way
to end this war.

1418
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,976
我们必须消灭能量体
We must destroy the Cube.

1419
01:34:53,784 --> 01:34:58,346
如果其它方法都失败的话
我会将它与我胸中之火光结合
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1420
01:34:58,455 --> 01:34:59,786
那是自杀行为
That's suicide.

1421
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:03,690
能量体的能源非常不稳定
可能会造成韩魏相攻
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1422
01:35:03,794 --> 01:35:08,254
为这星球的和平，牺牲是难免的
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1423
01:35:08,365 --> 01:35:11,664
我们不能让人类为我们的错误而偿命
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1424
01:35:13,136 --> 01:35:15,832
很荣幸与你们共战至今
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1425
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:19,739
- 汽车人，出发！
- 出发！
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

1426
01:35:31,788 --> 01:35:34,951
立正！敬礼！
Team attention! Present arms!

1427
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:39,857
稍息，上尉，得到你的情报了，干得好
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1428
01:35:39,963 --> 01:35:41,658
谢谢，炮艇机呢？
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1429
01:35:41,765 --> 01:35:43,892
所有炮艇机上加装了脱壳穿甲弹
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1430
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,262
如果他们再来袭击，没问题的
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1431
01:35:45,368 --> 01:35:48,462
不恢复全球的通讯可不行啊
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1432
01:35:49,973 --> 01:35:51,201
嘿，小子
Hey, kid.

1433
01:35:52,275 --> 01:35:54,937
我想我们之前有点误会
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1434
01:35:55,479 --> 01:35:56,571
你一定饿了吧？
You must be hungry?

1435
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,671
要不要来杯拿铁咖啡
或者2份超大的玛琪朵咖啡如何？
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1436
01:35:58,782 --> 01:36:00,409
我的车呢？
Where's my car?

1437
01:36:00,517 --> 01:36:04,078
小子，你仔细听好
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1438
01:36:04,588 --> 01:36:06,283
这里人们的生命有危险
People can die here.

1439
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:09,352
你必须马上告诉我们你所知道的
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1440
01:36:09,459 --> 01:36:10,653
好吧
Okay.

1441
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,491
但你得先把我的车、我父母还我
全部要书面保证
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1442
01:36:14,598 --> 01:36:19,297
噢，还有她的少年前科也必须取消，永久地
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1443
01:36:20,937 --> 01:36:23,906
跟我来，我们谈谈你的车
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1444
01:36:24,007 --> 01:36:25,304
谢谢
Thank you.

1445
01:36:26,776 --> 01:36:28,505
这家伙简直是勒索
The man's an extortionist.

1446
01:36:30,247 --> 01:36:31,578
情况是这样的
All right, here's the situation.

1447
01:36:31,681 --> 01:36:34,081
你们都曾直接接触过NBEs
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1448
01:36:34,184 --> 01:36:35,276
NBEs？
NBEs?

1449
01:36:35,385 --> 01:36:38,980
“非生物类外星人”，记清楚了
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1450
01:36:39,089 --> 01:36:42,718
你们即将看到的是高度机密
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1451
01:36:51,902 --> 01:36:52,469
天啊，这是什么？
Dear God. What is this?

1452
01:36:52,469 --> 01:36:53,731
天啊，这是什么？
Dear God. What is this?

1453
01:36:55,305 --> 01:36:58,570
我们认为，当他飞越北极时
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1454
01:36:58,675 --> 01:37:02,111
地球的地心引力扰乱了他的导航系统
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1455
01:37:02,212 --> 01:37:06,205
他坠落到冰里，大概是几千年前的事
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1456
01:37:06,316 --> 01:37:09,581
我们在1934年将它运送到这里
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1457
01:37:09,686 --> 01:37:12,086
我们称它为NBE-1
We call him NBE One.

1458
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:14,555
抱歉，先生，我不是想故意吐你的嘈
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1459
01:37:14,658 --> 01:37:17,058
但那是威震天
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1460
01:37:18,328 --> 01:37:20,159
他是霸天虎的领袖
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1461
01:37:20,263 --> 01:37:23,596
它自从1935年就处在冰冻状态
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1462
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:27,158
你的曾曾祖父发现了
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1463
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:28,703
人类史上最大的发现
in the history of mankind.

1464
01:37:28,805 --> 01:37:31,740
你所看到的就是现代化的来源
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1465
01:37:31,841 --> 01:37:38,679
微晶片、雷射、太空飞行、汽车…
都是对它进行逆向工程所习得的
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1466
01:37:38,782 --> 01:37:42,582
NBE-1，那是我们对它的称呼
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1467
01:37:43,153 --> 01:37:45,781
你不认为美国军方需要知道
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1468
01:37:45,889 --> 01:37:48,255
你把这么大一台机器人冰冻在地下室？
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1469
01:37:48,358 --> 01:37:52,351
在最近发生的事之前，我们并不认为
它的存在对国家安全产生任何问题
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1470
01:37:52,462 --> 01:37:54,327
现在问题可大了
Well, you got one now.

1471
01:37:55,265 --> 01:37:57,665
- 但为何要来地球？
- 因为火种源
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1472
01:37:57,767 --> 01:37:59,291
火种源？那是什么？
All Spark? What is that?

1473
01:37:59,402 --> 01:38:01,962
他们在找一个立方体似的东西
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1474
01:38:02,072 --> 01:38:06,839
NBE-1，也就是他们说的威震天先生
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

1475
01:38:06,943 --> 01:38:09,377
他是死亡的使者，想利用能量体
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1476
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:12,573
转化科技来统治宇宙
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1477
01:38:12,682 --> 01:38:14,206
那就是他们的计划
That's their plan.

1478
01:38:14,317 --> 01:38:16,717
- 你很确定？
- 是的
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1479
01:38:19,055 --> 01:38:21,319
你们知道那东西在哪里，是不是？
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1480
01:38:22,759 --> 01:38:23,885
跟我来
Follow me.

1481
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:30,021
你们将看到的东西是终极至宝
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1482
01:38:38,975 --> 01:38:42,536
碳-14年代测定预估能量体
是在公元前一万年来到地球的
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1483
01:38:43,446 --> 01:38:47,075
七元老在1913年才发现它
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1484
01:38:47,917 --> 01:38:51,785
他们知道这是外星物体
因为它表面的烙画
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1485
01:38:51,888 --> 01:38:53,412
和NBE-1表面的烙画非常相似
as well as NBE One.

1486
01:38:53,523 --> 01:38:56,083
胡佛总统因此建造了水坝将它隐藏于其中
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1487
01:38:56,192 --> 01:38:58,558
四个足球场厚度的水泥…
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1488
01:38:58,662 --> 01:39:01,995
任何人或外面的任何外星种族
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1489
01:39:02,098 --> 01:39:05,693
都无法侦测出它所散发的能量
or any alien species on the outside.

1490
01:39:14,394 --> 01:39:15,694
火种源位置确定
spark

1491
01:39:18,595 --> 01:39:21,095
我是红蜘蛛，所有霸天虎，准备行动
starscream

1492
01:39:22,396 --> 01:39:25,196
路障上路
barricade

1493
01:39:27,297 --> 01:39:28,697
吵闹报到…
devastator

1494
01:39:35,398 --> 01:39:36,598
袭击出发…
bonecrusher

1495
01:39:38,899 --> 01:39:40,299
眩晕入列…
blackout

1496
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,200
威震天万岁！
all hail

1497
01:39:44,507 --> 01:39:48,307
等等，你说水坝隐藏了他的能量
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1498
01:39:48,945 --> 01:39:51,436
- 哪种能量？
- 问得好
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1499
01:39:56,019 --> 01:39:58,886
请进来，他们要把我们锁在里面
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1500
01:40:04,794 --> 01:40:06,455
喔
Oh, wow.

1501
01:40:06,563 --> 01:40:08,588
佛瑞迪来过这里吗？
(【半夜鬼上床】里的坏人)
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1502
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:09,892
不对
Oh, no, man.

1503
01:40:10,033 --> 01:40:14,493
佛瑞迪有四根爪子
那只有三根，那是金刚狼（X战警）
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1504
01:40:14,604 --> 01:40:17,539
- 对不对？那是金刚狼
- 很好笑
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1505
01:40:19,075 --> 01:40:22,101
谁有电子产品？黑莓？车钥匙？手机？
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1506
01:40:22,212 --> 01:40:23,645
我有个手机
I got a phone.

1507
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:29,444
诺基亚真是酷毙了
Nokias are real nasty.

1508
01:40:29,552 --> 01:40:33,989
日本人真厉害
他们将武士道发挥地淋漓尽至
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1509
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:36,918
诺基亚是芬兰做的
Nokia's from Finland.

1510
01:40:37,026 --> 01:40:41,588
没错，但他，有点奇怪，有点奇怪
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1511
01:40:44,367 --> 01:40:49,930
我们把能量体的能源传送到这箱子里
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1512
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:06,919
- 好凶的小东西
- 好可怕！
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

1513
01:41:07,023 --> 01:41:10,686
就像劲量的兔宝宝一样
(装了电池的玩具兔子一直打鼓且走不停)
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1514
01:41:21,704 --> 01:41:23,569
它快把箱子打破了
He's breaking the box.

1515
01:41:41,558 --> 01:41:42,684
行动！行动！
Go! Go! Go!

1516
01:41:42,792 --> 01:41:43,884
出发！
Move!

1517
01:41:52,435 --> 01:41:55,063
各位，他们知道能量体在这里
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1518
01:41:55,839 --> 01:41:57,170
班奈杰克，发生什么事了？
Banachek. What's going on?

1519
01:41:57,273 --> 01:41:59,104
NBE-1停机棚断电了
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1520
01:41:59,209 --> 01:42:00,267
- 什么？
- …备用发电机
- What?
...and the backup generator

1521
01:42:00,376 --> 01:42:02,344
- 无法产生足够电量
- 你有没有军火库
- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?

1522
01:42:08,751 --> 01:42:10,514
（冷冻器失效）
威震天！威震天！威震天！
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1523
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,019
带上保安人员…
I'll bring security to the...

1524
01:42:12,121 --> 01:42:14,646
把所有人派去NBE-1停机棚！
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1525
01:42:14,757 --> 01:42:16,349
- 灯灭了！
- 行动！
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1526
01:42:16,459 --> 01:42:17,824
快！
Let's go!

1527
01:42:17,927 --> 01:42:19,690
它们在攻击我们的发电机！
They're popping our generators!

1528
01:42:31,708 --> 01:42:33,073
威震天冰在融化！
Megatron melting!

1529
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:36,770
16502，我们在失压
16502. We're losing pressure.

1530
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,075
各就各位！
Stand by! Set!

1531
01:42:39,182 --> 01:42:41,241
失压…失压
We're losing pressure!

1532
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:44,787
冷冻系统失常，我们失去NBE-1了
The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!

1533
01:42:49,526 --> 01:42:52,222
40毫米穿甲弹在那桌上
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1534
01:42:52,328 --> 01:42:56,321
带上所有弹药
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1535
01:43:01,871 --> 01:43:04,499
你必须带我去我的车
你必须带我去我的车
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1536
01:43:04,607 --> 01:43:05,631
它知道怎么处理能量体
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1537
01:43:05,742 --> 01:43:07,676
- 你的车？被没收了
- 那就别没收它
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1538
01:43:07,777 --> 01:43:09,506
我们不知道让它接近能源体会发生什么事！
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1539
01:43:09,612 --> 01:43:10,874
- 是你不知道
- 也许你知道，但我不知道
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1540
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:12,345
你就像在这坐以待毙？
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1541
01:43:12,448 --> 01:43:14,439
很多人的生命掌握在我们手上
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1542
01:43:14,551 --> 01:43:16,280
让他去见他的车！
Take him to his car!

1543
01:43:18,021 --> 01:43:19,215
放下武器
Drop it.

1544
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:22,651
喔！喔！喔！
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1545
01:43:23,927 --> 01:43:25,918
放下你的武器，军人
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1546
01:43:26,429 --> 01:43:28,158
外星人已经发动战争了，而你却要杀我？
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1547
01:43:28,264 --> 01:43:29,288
我们没必要杀你
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1548
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:31,594
我以第七区的权力命令你放手
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1549
01:43:31,701 --> 01:43:32,861
第七区并不存在
S-Seven don't exist.

1550
01:43:32,969 --> 01:43:34,732
我不会听命一个不存在的组织
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1551
01:43:34,837 --> 01:43:38,102
- 我数到五
- 我数到三
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1552
01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:42,337
- 西门斯？
- 是，先生
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

1553
01:43:42,445 --> 01:43:46,506
我会照他的做，输不是他们的选项
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1554
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,988
好吧，好吧
All right. Okay.

1555
01:43:53,089 --> 01:43:57,719
你想把世界的命运交给这小子的车，那好吧
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1556
01:44:01,164 --> 01:44:02,426
住手！住手！
No, no!

1557
01:44:03,399 --> 01:44:06,061
住手！住手！住手！
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1558
01:44:06,169 --> 01:44:09,730
住手！住手！住手！放开他！
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1559
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:12,339
你没事吗？
Are you okay?

1560
01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:16,303
他们没伤你吧？
They didn't hurt you, right?

1561
01:44:25,054 --> 01:44:28,854
听我说，能量体在这里，霸天虎已经来了
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1562
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,353
不、不、不，别管他们
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1563
01:44:33,463 --> 01:44:35,693
他们不会伤你的
They're not gonna hurt you.

1564
01:44:35,798 --> 01:44:39,325
退后一点，他没有恶意
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1565
01:44:39,435 --> 01:44:42,700
放下枪，他们不会伤害你的
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1566
01:44:42,805 --> 01:44:44,295
跟我来，我带你去看火种源
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1567
01:45:06,362 --> 01:45:09,854
来了，他要做什么了
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1568
01:45:29,986 --> 01:45:31,317
哦，天啊
Oh, my God.

1569
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:37,524
来自太空舰队的消息
（这句来自1966年的星际迷航）
Message from Starfleet, Captain.

1570
01:45:37,627 --> 01:45:39,026
把这个带走，上尉
Let's get to it.

1571
01:45:39,128 --> 01:45:42,154
他说的对，我们留下来就死定了
因为威震天就在隔壁的机棚里
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1572
01:45:42,265 --> 01:45:43,664
最近的城市在22英哩外
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1573
01:45:43,766 --> 01:45:45,063
我们把能量体偷带出去
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1574
01:45:45,168 --> 01:45:46,567
然后藏在城市里
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1575
01:45:46,669 --> 01:45:47,636
很好，就这么做
Good! Right.

1576
01:45:47,737 --> 01:45:50,467
但我们需要空军的帮忙
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1577
01:45:50,573 --> 01:45:52,632
这地方一定有无线电装置吧
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1578
01:45:52,742 --> 01:45:54,607
- 短波
- 有
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

1579
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:57,305
先生，你一定要想办法传递消息出去
我们走
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1580
01:45:57,413 --> 01:45:58,846
是非常旧的仪器
In the alien archive, sir!

1581
01:45:58,948 --> 01:46:00,939
- 外星…
- 之前陆军使用的
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1582
01:46:01,050 --> 01:46:02,574
- 还能用吗？
- 一切皆有可能！
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1583
01:46:02,685 --> 01:46:05,119
- 你看到…
- 山姆，上车！
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1584
01:46:05,221 --> 01:46:06,984
部长先生，请继续试着联络空军
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1585
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:08,717
等我们到了城市我们再找个无线电
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1586
01:46:08,825 --> 01:46:10,793
让埃普斯无线电导引
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1587
01:46:10,893 --> 01:46:12,417
是！
Affirmative!

1588
01:46:12,528 --> 01:46:16,362
警告，NBE-1冷冻系统故障
Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.

1589
01:46:17,366 --> 01:46:19,231
检查备用系统！
Check that backup system!

1590
01:46:19,335 --> 01:46:23,499
冷冻失效！冷冻失效！
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1591
01:46:23,606 --> 01:46:25,096
快点逃出这里！
Come on! Get out of here!

1592
01:46:25,208 --> 01:46:26,732
抬头！小心！
Heads up! Look out!

1593
01:46:27,744 --> 01:46:30,144
大家帮黄车开一条路
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1594
01:46:30,246 --> 01:46:33,682
- 这边！这边！
- 就在那！
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

1595
01:46:43,392 --> 01:46:46,452
我是威震天！
I am Megatron!

1596
01:47:05,281 --> 01:47:06,680
- 能量体没事吧？
- 没事
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1597
01:47:06,783 --> 01:47:07,772
系上安全带
Well, put the seat belt on.

1598
01:47:07,884 --> 01:47:09,044
弄到他身上！
Pour it on him!

1599
01:47:22,799 --> 01:47:24,790
很荣幸为您效劳，威震天
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1600
01:47:24,901 --> 01:47:27,301
能量体呢？
Where is the Cube?

1601
01:47:27,403 --> 01:47:29,462
被人类拿走了
The humans have taken it.

1602
01:47:32,842 --> 01:47:36,710
你又让我失望了，红蜘蛛
抓住他们
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1603
01:47:37,146 --> 01:47:38,613
用力！
Come on, Mags!

1604
01:47:39,715 --> 01:47:41,205
在这边，先生！
Over here, sir!

1605
01:47:43,553 --> 01:47:45,612
等一下，等一下
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1606
01:47:45,721 --> 01:47:48,155
拜托，拜托，插在这
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1607
01:47:50,059 --> 01:47:53,517
- 哈，通了，有电了！
- 麦克风在哪？
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1608
01:47:54,564 --> 01:47:55,553
麦克风！
Mikes?

1609
01:47:55,665 --> 01:47:56,927
没麦克风也没用
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1610
01:47:57,033 --> 01:47:58,591
不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1611
01:47:58,701 --> 01:48:00,225
快找找
Let's find them.

1612
01:48:00,336 --> 01:48:01,803
小子，你坐下
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1613
01:48:01,904 --> 01:48:04,065
- 好，好
- 他们把什么都偷走了
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

1614
01:48:04,173 --> 01:48:07,233
我们要怎么传出讯号？我们怎么联络空军？
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1615
01:48:07,343 --> 01:48:08,640
- 格伦？
- 嗯？
- Glen?
- Huh?

1616
01:48:08,744 --> 01:48:12,236
格伦，你能否把这台电脑接上无线电
然后送出讯号？
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1617
01:48:12,348 --> 01:48:13,337
那有什么用？
What good is that?

1618
01:48:13,449 --> 01:48:15,849
你可以把这台电脑连上无线电
然后传送莫尔斯电码！
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1619
01:48:15,952 --> 01:48:19,513
好、好！我可以！
快点，我看看
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1620
01:48:19,622 --> 01:48:21,453
西门斯，我要个螺丝刀
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1621
01:48:33,236 --> 01:48:34,760
擎天柱来了
There's Optimus.

1622
01:48:52,722 --> 01:48:54,189
快好了
Almost done.

1623
01:48:56,025 --> 01:48:57,925
那是什么玩意？
What the hell was that?

1624
01:49:00,997 --> 01:49:02,692
把门堵住！
Barricade the door!

1625
01:49:05,434 --> 01:49:07,800
- 找些东西
- 小心！

Six, five, four, six, three.

1627
01:49:14,677 --> 01:49:17,043
装弹！
Here! Put some rounds in!

1628
01:49:19,916 --> 01:49:21,349
全局搜索…
Master search.

1629
01:49:22,251 --> 01:49:24,242
我成功了，正在发送
I got it! We're transmitting!

1630
01:49:24,353 --> 01:49:25,479
照我说的写
Send exactly what I say!

1631
01:49:25,588 --> 01:49:29,718
烧死你！
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1632
01:49:29,825 --> 01:49:33,852
这里是国防部长凯勒…
致北方司令部长官
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1633
01:49:33,963 --> 01:49:35,487
- 喔！
- 喔！
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1634
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:38,223
刚才是什么啊！
What was that?

1635
01:49:38,334 --> 01:49:41,167
启动紧急步骤，黑鸟1195…
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1636
01:49:43,339 --> 01:49:45,534
长官，我们确认国防部长
的空袭命令
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1637
01:50:10,266 --> 01:50:12,234
- 不不不
- 怎么？
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1638
01:50:12,335 --> 01:50:15,771
还是那辆警车！挡住他们！
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

1639
01:50:36,993 --> 01:50:37,982
哦，天啊
Oh, my God.

1640
01:51:06,555 --> 01:51:07,886
真酷，妈妈！
Cool, Mom!

1641
01:51:33,783 --> 01:51:35,774
情况不妙
This is so not good.

1642
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:56,135
他在柱子后面！
He's behind the pillar!

1643
01:52:02,011 --> 01:52:05,105
- 打死他
- 麦姬，掩护！
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

1644
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:10,582
空军已经回应
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1645
01:52:14,457 --> 01:52:16,425
烧死你！
Sucker, burn!

1646
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:23,529
哦，糟糕！
Oh, shit!

1647
01:52:23,866 --> 01:52:25,891
他们派F-22到城市去了！
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1648
01:52:27,103 --> 01:52:29,128
出动！出动！出动！

短波无线电
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1652
01:52:53,462 --> 01:52:55,657
我怎么用这玩意？
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1653
01:52:55,764 --> 01:52:58,062
用它联系，只有这个了！
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1654
01:52:58,467 --> 01:53:01,459
这个是中古电器行的古董了
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1655
01:53:01,570 --> 01:53:04,505
范围最多20-30英里
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1656
01:53:04,607 --> 01:53:07,303
呼叫城市上方的飞机
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1657
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:09,502
12点方向，F-22战斗机

请求飞机空中掩护
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1659
01:53:12,414 --> 01:53:14,279
黑鹰直升机运送能量体
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1660
01:53:16,785 --> 01:53:19,185
空军到了
放烟雾信号
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1661
01:53:19,488 --> 01:53:21,115
猛禽猛禽，能否听到
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1662
01:53:22,391 --> 01:53:23,551
能看到你们

1666
01:53:37,206 --> 01:53:38,867
请回应我
Please tell me you copy.

1667
01:53:39,208 --> 01:53:41,506
退后，掩护，大黄蜂！

大黄蜂，你的腿！

你的腿！
Your legs.

1676
01:54:34,763 --> 01:54:38,392
后退，后退！你没事吧？
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1677
01:54:39,935 --> 01:54:42,369
拜托，大黄蜂，快起来！
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1679
01:54:47,009 --> 01:54:48,476

- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1680
01:54:48,577 --> 01:54:50,511
什么意思？他们向我们开火！
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

1681
01:54:50,613 --> 01:54:52,979
F-22不可能飞得比房子还低
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1682
01:54:53,082 --> 01:54:55,243
刚才那个是外星人
不是自己人！
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1683
01:54:55,351 --> 01:54:58,149
你要站起来，你没事的
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1684
01:54:59,421 --> 01:55:00,445

是威震天，快撤退！
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

撤退！
Fall back!

1697
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,395
快让我们的人离开这！快！
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1698
01:57:27,503 --> 01:57:29,528
离开这辆车！
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1699
01:57:29,638 --> 01:57:31,902
我们需要空中支援，马上要！
We need air cover down here now!

1700
01:57:37,913 --> 01:57:39,312
山姆，过来帮我
Sam, help me with this.

1701
01:57:43,485 --> 01:57:47,819
- 就这点本事，威震天？
- 小杂种
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

1702
01:57:47,923 --> 01:57:50,016
你想尝尝厉害么？
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1703
01:57:50,125 --> 01:57:52,423
来个双份的！
No! I want two!

1704
01:57:53,996 --> 01:57:55,395
怎么回事？
What's going on?

1705
01:57:57,199 --> 01:57:59,827
长官，那坦克又起来了
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1706
01:58:00,702 --> 01:58:02,966
哦，这些家伙怎么不死呢
Oh, these things just don't die.

1707
01:58:06,542 --> 01:58:08,032
我们惨了
Oh, we're so dead.

1708
01:58:08,143 --> 01:58:10,475
- 扣在头部！
- 山姆！
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1709
01:58:10,779 --> 01:58:11,768
能量体呢？
Where's the Cube?

1710
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:12,847
- 就在这
- 好的
- Right there.
- Okay.

1711
01:58:12,948 --> 01:58:13,937
把它拿过去绕在底盘
And take that and wrap it around

1712
01:58:14,049 --> 01:58:15,016
然后围在脖子上
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1713
01:58:15,117 --> 01:58:17,779
- 明白吗？
- 埃普斯，让那些黑鹰战机过来！
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1714
01:58:19,221 --> 01:58:20,688
那座楼
That building.

1715
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:26,257
- 好了
- 怎么办？
- Okay.
- What?

1716
01:58:26,361 --> 01:58:29,330
我不能让我的人留在那
你拿着信号弹
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1717
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:31,695
那边有个白色大楼，上面有雕塑的
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

1718
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,995
- 到楼顶去，拉开信号弹
- 不
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1719
01:58:34,102 --> 01:58:36,036
- 打开信号弹通知直升机
- 不，不，我做不到
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

1720
01:58:36,138 --> 01:58:40,541
听着！你现在是个战士！
我要你带走能量体
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1721
01:58:40,642 --> 01:58:42,872
送回军方手里，这里我们顶着
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1722
01:58:42,978 --> 01:58:45,037
否则会死很多人的
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1723
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:46,670
- 你快走，你快走
- 不，我不走
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

1724
01:58:46,782 --> 01:58:47,942
- 你得走了
- 不，我不走
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

1725
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:50,746
大黄蜂不走，我就不能走
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1726
01:58:52,221 --> 01:58:53,279
呼叫黑鹰直升机
Army Black Hawk requested.

1727
01:58:53,388 --> 01:58:55,913
请求立刻送走一个男孩和重要物品
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1728
01:58:56,024 --> 01:58:58,549
他在房顶上，有信号弹
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1729
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:01,754
- 山姆，我们会掩护你的
- 好吧
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

1730
01:59:03,365 --> 01:59:06,698
- 埃普斯，飞机呢？
- 山姆！
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

1731
01:59:10,672 --> 01:59:14,802
无论结局会怎样
我都很高兴那天上了你的车
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1732
01:59:18,046 --> 01:59:20,674
山姆！快行动！
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1733
01:59:20,782 --> 01:59:24,013
- 霸天虎，进攻！
- 开火！
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

1734
01:59:26,755 --> 01:59:28,848
火力掩护！
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1735
01:59:35,297 --> 01:59:36,594
小心！
Watch out!

1736
01:59:42,204 --> 01:59:45,230
- 快把车开走！
- 马上就走！
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

1737
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:47,001
赶快走！
Get out of here now!

1738
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:15,837
威震天！
Megatron!

1739
02:00:16,138 --> 02:00:17,105
擎天柱
Prime.

1740
02:00:43,065 --> 02:00:45,124
人类不配活着
Humans don't deserve to live.

1741
02:00:45,233 --> 02:00:47,895
这要由人类自己决定
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1742
02:00:48,337 --> 02:00:50,703
跟他们一起去死吧！
Then you will die with them!

1743
02:00:56,378 --> 02:00:58,778
一同毁灭！
Join them in extinction!

1744
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,661
继续跑，山姆！
Keep moving, Sam!

1745
02:01:20,669 --> 02:01:22,034
别停！
Don't stop!

1746
02:01:38,053 --> 02:01:39,042
不！
No!

1747
02:01:54,269 --> 02:01:56,362
山姆，快去大楼！
Sam, get to the building!

1748
02:02:04,279 --> 02:02:06,406
把能量体给我，孩子！
Give me that Cube, boy!

1749
02:02:19,061 --> 02:02:21,154
那个臭小子不会把我车撞瘪了吧？
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1750
02:02:42,517 --> 02:02:45,975
你抓不到我的
你抓不到我的！
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1751
02:02:51,293 --> 02:02:54,421
我闻到你的气味了，臭小子！
I smell you, boy!

1752
02:03:06,641 --> 02:03:07,801
小杂种！
Maggot!

1753
02:03:26,828 --> 02:03:28,420
哦，不！
Oh, no!

1754
02:03:52,988 --> 02:03:54,819
我开车，你开枪！
I'll drive! You shoot!

1755
02:04:15,777 --> 02:04:17,074
情况不妙
This isn't going well!

1756
02:04:17,179 --> 02:04:18,578
开枪，开枪
Shoot! Shoot!

1757
02:05:04,426 --> 02:05:05,654
打得好
Nice shot.

1758
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:09,218
- 那坦克这次肯定死了
- 大家继续战斗
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

1759
02:05:19,708 --> 02:05:20,766
嘿！
Hey!

1760
02:05:24,246 --> 02:05:27,682
嘿！我在这！
Hey! I'm over here!

1761
02:05:40,028 --> 02:05:41,723
找到男孩了
We've got the boy.

1762
02:05:46,334 --> 02:05:47,767
小心！
Watch out!

1763
02:05:48,136 --> 02:05:49,330
导弹！
Missile!

1764
02:05:59,814 --> 02:06:01,247
撑住，山姆！
Hang on, Sam!

1765
02:06:09,991 --> 02:06:11,322
不！不！
No! No!

1766
02:06:17,032 --> 02:06:22,060
这到底是恐惧还是勇气控制着你？
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1767
02:06:35,617 --> 02:06:37,084
该怎么办
Where do I go?

1768
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:42,379
把火种源给我
我饶你不死，当我的宠物
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1769
02:06:43,692 --> 02:06:45,319
不，不，不，不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1770
02:06:49,497 --> 02:06:51,931
我绝对不会给你这个火种源！
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1771
02:06:52,067 --> 02:06:54,865
真愚钝
Oh, so unwise.

1772
02:07:06,815 --> 02:07:08,305
接住了
I got you, boy.

1773
02:07:10,118 --> 02:07:11,915
抱紧能量体！
Hold on to the Cube!

1774
02:07:31,606 --> 02:07:34,473
- 哦，不！
- 真恶心
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

1775
02:07:39,481 --> 02:07:40,505
山姆
Sam?

1776
02:07:44,786 --> 02:07:48,017
你用你的生命保护了能量体
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1777
02:07:48,757 --> 02:07:50,224
没有付出
No sacrifice,

1778
02:07:51,593 --> 02:07:54,653
- 就没有胜利
- 如果杀不了威震天
- no victory.
- Lf I cannot defeat Megatron,

1779
02:07:54,996 --> 02:07:57,487
你一定要把能量体塞入我的胸膛
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1780
02:07:57,899 --> 02:08:01,096
我会牺牲自己，与它同归于尽
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1781
02:08:01,569 --> 02:08:03,036
躲到我身后去
Get behind me.

1782
02:08:04,739 --> 02:08:07,299
只有你我两个的决斗了，威震天
It's you and me, Megatron.

1783
02:08:07,409 --> 02:08:10,344
不，只有我，擎天柱
No, it's just me, Prime.

1784
02:08:12,781 --> 02:08:17,912
决战结束时
胜者会屹立，败者会倒下
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1785
02:08:23,324 --> 02:08:28,159
你仍然在为弱者而战
所以你必输无疑
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1786
02:08:47,315 --> 02:08:49,715
战机60秒后到
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1787
02:08:49,818 --> 02:08:52,286
两派机器人都有
我们会用激光标记敌人
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1788
02:08:52,387 --> 02:08:53,411
嘿
Hey.

1789
02:08:54,622 --> 02:08:56,783
呼叫空袭，明白？
Bring the rain. All right?

1790
02:08:57,192 --> 02:08:59,183
我们来消灭这些东西
All right, let's kill these things.

1791
02:09:01,162 --> 02:09:02,720
- 快走！
- 记住，向下瞄准
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

1792
02:09:02,831 --> 02:09:04,822
盔甲的弱点在胸部下面
Armor's weak under the chest.

1793
02:09:14,909 --> 02:09:16,467
目标已被标出，等待中
Target marked. Still waiting.

1794
02:09:16,578 --> 02:09:18,603
20秒钟到达目标
Time on target, 20 seconds.

1795
02:09:25,553 --> 02:09:27,646
F-22战机，我们还在等
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1796
02:09:32,894 --> 02:09:34,327
快走！
Move out!

1797
02:09:37,565 --> 02:09:38,793
来了！
Incoming!

1798
02:09:47,342 --> 02:09:49,435
载弹发射，目标绿色
Weapons armed. Status green.

1799
02:10:08,096 --> 02:10:09,927
快走！
Run! Move!

1800
02:10:17,438 --> 02:10:18,962
第二波来了
Second wave's on approach.

1801
02:10:22,477 --> 02:10:24,069
那是谁，小心！
What is that? Break off!

1802
02:10:24,179 --> 02:10:26,647
- 收到
- 大量的…
- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...

1803
02:10:35,390 --> 02:10:37,551
2号，锁定，干掉他！
Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!

1804
02:10:41,629 --> 02:10:43,722
盯住他，别让他跑了
Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.

1805
02:10:44,098 --> 02:10:45,395
把他带走！
Take him out!

1806
02:10:59,614 --> 02:11:00,945
2号中弹！
Two's down!

1807
02:11:10,391 --> 02:11:12,325
我要杀了你！
I'll kill you!

1808
02:11:12,427 --> 02:11:15,191
火种源是我的！
Mine! All Spark!

1809
02:11:16,164 --> 02:11:19,031
山姆！快把能量体塞入我的胸膛！
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1810
02:11:19,734 --> 02:11:20,758
山姆！
Sam!

1811
02:11:21,636 --> 02:11:22,830
不，山姆！
No, Sam!

1812
02:11:48,663 --> 02:11:49,823
不要开火
Hold up.

1813
02:11:52,934 --> 02:11:55,903
你逼得我别无选择，老兄
You left me no choice, brother.

1814
02:12:05,513 --> 02:12:08,380
山姆，我欠你一条命
Sam, I owe you my life.

1815
02:12:09,517 --> 02:12:11,246
我们都欠你的情
We are in your debt.

1816
02:12:30,772 --> 02:12:33,172
擎天柱，我们没能救他
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1817
02:12:34,042 --> 02:12:35,339
爵士
Jazz.

1818
02:12:38,546 --> 02:12:40,741
我们失去了一位杰出的战友
We lost a great comrade

1819
02:12:42,083 --> 02:12:43,948
但也结识了新的战友
but gained new ones.

1820
02:12:44,218 --> 02:12:46,516
谢谢大家
Thank you, all of you.

1821
02:12:46,854 --> 02:12:49,220
我们敬佩你们的勇敢
You honor us with your bravery.

1822
02:12:50,258 --> 02:12:52,226
我有话要说，长官
Permission to speak, sir?

1823
02:12:52,727 --> 02:12:55,594
请讲吧，老朋友
Permission granted, old friend.

1824
02:12:55,697 --> 02:12:57,164
你能说话了？
You speak now?

1825
02:12:58,099 --> 02:13:00,192
我希望和男孩呆在一起
I wish to stay with the boy.

1826
02:13:01,069 --> 02:13:02,900
如果他也同意
If that is his choice.

1827
02:13:07,842 --> 02:13:08,866
同意
Yes.

1828
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:34,263
总统已经下令将第七区组织解散
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1829
02:13:34,802 --> 02:13:37,828
处理掉外星人尸体
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1830
02:13:38,473 --> 02:13:41,772
罗伦提恩海沟有7英里深
The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,

1831
02:13:41,876 --> 02:13:43,969
地球上最深的地方
deepest place on our planet.

1832
02:13:44,212 --> 02:13:47,739
这个深度的极高压与极低温
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,

1833
02:13:47,849 --> 02:13:50,044
会把尸体压扁
would crush and entomb them,

1834
02:13:51,853 --> 02:13:53,582
不留任何蛛丝马迹
leaving no evidence.

1835
02:14:00,228 --> 02:14:04,631
火种源被摧毁
我们已经无法回到自己的星球
With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.

1836
02:14:06,367 --> 02:14:08,961
造化弄人
And fate has yielded its reward,

1837
02:14:10,505 --> 02:14:13,406
我们现在有了一个新家叫做地球
a new world to call home.

1838
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:23,878
我们已经和这里的人民共同生活
藏在他们眼皮之下
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,

1839
02:14:24,018 --> 02:14:26,782
也在悄悄地地保护他们
but watching over them in secret,

1840
02:14:27,021 --> 02:14:29,581
等待，保护
waiting, protecting.

1841
02:14:30,992 --> 02:14:34,018
我目睹了他们的勇气
I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.

1842
02:14:34,629 --> 02:14:37,621
尽管和我们来自不同世界
And though we are worlds apart,

1843
02:14:37,732 --> 02:14:42,669
但像我们一样，他们也不可貌相
like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.

1844
02:14:44,205 --> 02:14:46,696
我是擎天柱
I am Optimus Prime

1845
02:14:47,108 --> 02:14:50,475
在这里召唤所有
and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots

1846
02:14:50,578 --> 02:14:53,570
在宇宙中流亡的汽车人
taking refuge among the stars.

1847
02:14:54,615 --> 02:14:56,344
我们在这里
We are here.

1848
02:14:56,918 --> 02:14:58,943
等待
We are waiting.

1849
02:15:02,604 --> 02:15:04,544
导演：迈克尔・贝
（不要走开，后面还有）
michael bay

1850
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:23,267
你们知道最近这个地方有
所谓的外星人活动吗？
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1851
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:31,775
你知道吗？我想如果真有外星人…
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1852
02:15:32,386 --> 02:15:34,286
- 入侵…
- 嗯
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1853
02:15:34,655 --> 02:15:37,089
他们，政府，会第一个让我们知道
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1854
02:15:37,191 --> 02:15:38,852
政府会让我们知道的
The government would let us know.

1855
02:15:39,026 --> 02:15:40,618
- 我是说，这里是美国
- 对
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

1856
02:15:40,728 --> 02:15:43,162
正因为那样，我们才知道
我们生活在一片自由的土地上
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1857
02:15:43,264 --> 02:15:44,891
因为没有秘密
