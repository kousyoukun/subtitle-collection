1
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:56,875
<i>Before time began, there was the Cube.</i>

2
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:59,541
<i>We know not where it comes from,</i>

3
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,886
<i>only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.</i>

4
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,484
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

5
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:12,061
<i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i>

6
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:18,726
<i>but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.</i>

7
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:21,967
<i>And so began the war,</i>

8
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:27,100
<i>a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,</i>

9
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:32,343
<i>and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.</i>

10
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:38,750
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,</i>

11
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:43,350
<i>searching every star, every world.</i>

12
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:49,833
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us</i>

13
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:54,370
<i>to an unknown planet called Earth.</i>

14
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,645
<i>But we were already too late.</i>

15
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,185
Oh, God, five months of this.

16
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:21,787
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,924
<i>A plate of mama's alligators étouffée.</i>

18
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:26,195
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:29,466
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

20
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:32,872
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,034
I understand.

22
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:39,911
English, please. English.

23
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,713
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

24
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,015
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:50,053
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,188
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,961
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:02,028
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:05,170
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,765
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

31
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:07,844
Shut up!

32
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:28,765
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,759
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

34
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:32,960
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,268
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:40,537
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:43,539
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

38
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,911
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:48,610
- Water?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:50,285
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:57,427 --> 00:04:01,761
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

42
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:10,996
<i>Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.</i>

43
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:13,906
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:19,843
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,783
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

46
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:32,427
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:35,657
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:38,967
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,629
<i>Tail 4500 X-ray.</i>

50
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:44,206
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:46,138
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:48,302
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

53
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:50,380
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:54,981
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

55
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,417
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,655
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

57
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:09,658
<i>- My ladies!
- Look.</i>

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,763
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:14,996
<i>Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.</i>

60
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:16,829
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

61
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,067
I know that people say that all the time,

62
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,542
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:23,408
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:26,107
<i>- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.</i>

65
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:29,151
<i>You sure she didn't just fart?</i>

66
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:31,049
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:33,645
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

68
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:38,060
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,795
<i>Bogie's on the deck.</i>

70
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:48,032
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,404
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:54,072
<i>- Will?
- Sarah?</i>

73
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:57,581
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:05:57,581 --> 00:05:58,013
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

75
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:03,712
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

76
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:10,788
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

77
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:17,155
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

78
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:29,009
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

79
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,245
My God.

80
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:57,533
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

81
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:27,734
Go! Move! Move!

82
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:36,373
It's going after the files!

83
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,844
Cut the hard lines!

84
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,882
I need a key! It's locked!

85
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,412
Move! Move!

86
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:51,125
Here, come here! Come here!

87
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:08,171
Here, hide in here!

88
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,376
Oh, my God. Okay.

89
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:13,037
No!

90
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:15,818
Oh!

91
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:27,626
What the...

92
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:38,337
Epps, let's go!

93
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,793
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

94
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,530
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

95
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,827
Watch.

96
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:05,935
Okay.

97
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,632
For my family...

98
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:13,175
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

99
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,446
Okay.

100
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,573
So, for my family genealogy report,

101
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:23,812
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

102
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:27,156
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

103
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,648
Very famous explorer.

104
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:35,186
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

105
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:42,494
<i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.</i>

106
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,604
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

107
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:53,113
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

108
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:58,046
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

109
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,554
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

110
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,754
So that's the story, right?

111
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,055
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

112
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:07,993
used by 19th-century seamen.

113
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:11,300
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

114
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:12,698
It's all for sale, by the way.

115
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:17,501
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

116
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:20,073
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

117
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:22,906
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

118
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,243
Are you going to sell me his liver?

119
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:27,942
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

120
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:29,143
I don't think your grandfather would be

121
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:30,480
particularly proud of what you're doing.

122
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:33,818
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

123
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:35,982
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

124
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:37,423
Cold hard cash works, too.

125
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:39,825
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

126
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,260
- Sam!
- Sorry.

127
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,193
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

128
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:48,134
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

129
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,398
drawing these strange symbols

130
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:51,974
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

131
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,736
that he thought he'd discovered.

132
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:57,677
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

133
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,079
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

134
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:02,515
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

135
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:05,179
Okay. Pretty good, right?

136
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,524
I'd say a solid B-.

137
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:12,216
A B-?

138
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:14,353
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

139
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:15,624
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

140
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:16,960
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

141
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,399
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

142
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,060
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

143
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:23,799
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

144
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:25,670
And a man's promise to that boy.

145
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:28,608
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

146
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,975
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

147
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:33,208
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

148
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:37,377
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

149
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:42,281
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

150
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:45,023
Yes! Yes, yes.

151
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:47,530
So?

152
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:48,831
A-. It's an A, though.

153
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,695
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

154
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,495
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

155
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,500
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

156
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,831
Yeah, a little surprise.

157
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:03,471
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

158
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:05,937
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

159
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:08,984
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

160
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,349
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

161
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:15,924
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

162
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:18,687
a Porsche for your first car?

163
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:20,990
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

164
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:24,589
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

165
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:29,205
- Manny!
- What?

166
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,767
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

167
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,967
He's having a heat stroke again.

168
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:34,134
Scaring white folks.

169
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:36,144
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

170
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:39,574
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

171
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:41,240
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

172
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:43,716
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

173
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,287
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

174
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:46,719
<i>- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.</i>

175
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:49,917
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

176
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,789
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

177
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:54,090
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

178
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,459
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

179
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:56,623
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,500
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

181
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:02,696
How can I help you?

182
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:05,569
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

183
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:08,569
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

184
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:13,047
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

185
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,515
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

186
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:20,480
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

187
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:24,590
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

188
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:26,622
The car'll pick the driver.

189
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:29,527
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

190
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:32,533
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

191
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:37,163
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

192
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,934
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

193
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:44,104
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

194
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:51,743
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

195
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,287
This ain't bad.

196
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:56,616
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:56,726 --> 00:13:58,057
It got racing...

198
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,560
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

199
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:02,426
I don't know nothing about this car.

200
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:03,760
- Manny!
- What?

201
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:06,460
What is this? This car! Check it out!

202
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:09,060
<i>I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!</i>

203
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:11,663
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

204
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,298
Feels good.

205
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,873
- How much?
- Well,

206
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:22,843
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

207
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:24,749
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

208
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:28,915
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

209
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,049
It's custom faded?

210
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,923
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

211
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:35,827
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

212
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:37,824
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

213
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,492
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

214
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:42,799
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

215
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:46,068
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

216
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:48,302
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

217
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:51,005
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

218
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,139
This is a classic engine right here.

219
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,581
I sold a car the other day...

220
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,053
Gee. Holy cow.

221
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:00,588
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

222
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,456
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

223
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,221
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

224
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:08,456
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

225
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:10,499
<i>... greater than man...</i>

226
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,694
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

227
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:31,920
$4,000.

228
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,726
Steve.

229
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:47,735
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

230
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:51,331
They're so young.

231
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,568
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

232
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,940
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

233
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:59,412
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

234
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,513
I am so underdressed.

235
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:05,610
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

236
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,151
Please be seated.

237
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,188
I'm John Keller.

238
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:15,560
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

239
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,833
<i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i>

240
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:22,132
<i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.</i>

241
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:25,603
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

242
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:29,308
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

243
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:31,539
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

244
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:35,083
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

245
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:39,052
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

246
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,458
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

247
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:46,551
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

248
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:55,830
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

249
00:16:57,306 --> 00:17:00,400
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

250
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,977
and intercept further communications,

251
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:04,876
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

252
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:09,179
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

253
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,882
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

254
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:14,582
The President has dispatched
battle groups

255
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,854
<i>to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.</i>

256
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:20,588
<i>Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.</i>

257
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:23,597
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

258
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,223
Good luck to us all.

259
00:17:34,677 --> 00:17:38,113
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

260
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:43,812
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

261
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:45,044
Zero bids.

262
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:48,820
Great. Broke.

263
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,291
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

264
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:54,593
No. Premature.

265
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:56,028
Good. What's up?

266
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:58,965
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

267
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:02,464
It's like clockwork.

268
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:04,164
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

269
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:07,333
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

270
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:09,741
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

271
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:13,942
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

272
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,244
This one is wobbly.

273
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:19,447
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

274
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:20,681
- Sam...
- What?

275
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,350
I do not like footprints on my grass.

276
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,654
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

277
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:27,456
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

278
00:18:27,563 --> 00:18:29,690
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

279
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,892
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

280
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:34,094
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

281
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,364
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

282
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,030
That's his bling.

283
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,341
I want you home at 11:00!

284
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:42,308
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

285
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:44,538
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

286
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:45,875
Seat belt on!

287
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:55,848
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:59,959
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

289
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:10,363
<i>At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.</i>

290
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:11,874
Oh, my God.

291
00:19:11,974 --> 00:19:13,805
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,</i>

292
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,037
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

293
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,075
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:21,547
that we have not come across before.

295
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:24,686
<i>But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...</i>

296
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:26,616
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

297
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:30,449
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

298
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:33,422
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:36,623
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

300
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,029
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,296
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

302
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:42,701
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

303
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,964
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

304
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:48,043
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

305
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:52,107
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:54,712
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,409
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

308
00:19:56,586 --> 00:20:00,886
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

309
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,854
It looked right at me.

310
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:07,860
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

311
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:09,397
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

312
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:10,829
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

313
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,928
<i>- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

314
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:17,005
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

315
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:18,630
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

316
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,402
All right, let's hit it.

317
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:26,178
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

318
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:30,150
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

319
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:33,080
Oh, my God.

320
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:36,719
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

321
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:38,384
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

322
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:39,461
Okay.

323
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,130
Hey, guys, check it out.

324
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:47,603
Oh, hi.

325
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:51,799
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

326
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:59,005
So, what are you guys doing here?

327
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,615
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:04,216
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

329
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,787
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

330
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:08,857
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

331
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:11,723
Let's go call your mom.

332
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:15,729
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

333
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:18,527
I was researching a book I was writing.

334
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:19,931
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

335
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:22,402
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:27,535
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

337
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:29,873
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

338
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:33,142
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

339
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,809
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

340
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:37,612
That's funny.

341
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:40,414
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

342
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:45,489
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

343
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:47,653
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

344
00:21:47,763 --> 00:21:50,357
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

345
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,494
What are you doing?

346
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:54,660
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

347
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,204
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:57,306 --> 00:22:00,571
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

349
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:03,645
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

350
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:06,738
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:11,084
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

352
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:13,689
Okay.

353
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:16,590
You'll call me.

354
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:25,899
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

355
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:27,491
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

356
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:29,503
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

357
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:32,233
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

358
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:33,968
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

359
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:35,338
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

360
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:36,843
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

361
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,573
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

362
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,478
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,914
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

364
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:43,211
Bros before hos.

365
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,082
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

366
00:22:45,187 --> 00:22:46,176
You can't do this to me.

367
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:48,381
You got to get out of my car right now.

368
00:22:52,228 --> 00:22:55,664
<i>Who's gonna come around
when you break?</i>

369
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:58,632
Mikaela! It's Sam.

370
00:22:58,734 --> 00:22:59,758
Witwicky.

371
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:02,430
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

372
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:03,505
You sure?

373
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:05,369
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

374
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:08,932
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

375
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:11,173
There you go.

376
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,287
So...

377
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:25,558
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

378
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:29,624
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

379
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:31,757
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

380
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:37,100
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

381
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:40,198
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

382
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,836
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:45,507
Big arms?

384
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:50,247
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

385
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:52,843
Like, I just put in that light there.

386
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:57,381
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

387
00:23:59,295 --> 00:24:00,262
Yeah.

388
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,900
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,833
Oh, no, no.

390
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:10,838
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,237
- Really?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:13,972
Yeah, a long time.

393
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:15,976
Well, do we have any classes together?

394
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:17,636
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?

395
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:21,238
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

396
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,612
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

397
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:26,154
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

398
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:27,916
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

399
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:29,718
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

400
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:32,259
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

401
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:36,260
No, no, no. No. Come on.

402
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:40,067
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

403
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:43,630
<i>When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing</i>

404
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,469
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

405
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:48,270
<i>Sexual healing</i>

406
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:50,607
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

407
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:53,682
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

408
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:56,182
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:57,980
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

410
00:24:58,087 --> 00:24:59,418
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

411
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:01,853
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:05,017
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

413
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:06,621
<i>I feel good</i>

414
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:08,128
Just pop the hood.

415
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:11,760
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

416
00:25:14,203 --> 00:25:15,431
Whoa, nice headers.

417
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:17,095
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

418
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:19,606
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

419
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:20,936
Double-pump?

420
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:23,739
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:27,509
I like to go faster.

422
00:25:27,716 --> 00:25:31,550
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:34,483
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:39,617
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:25:39,728 --> 00:25:43,164
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

426
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:45,460
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

427
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:46,556
Oh, my God.

428
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:48,227
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

429
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:51,363
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

430
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:54,101
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

431
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:57,076
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

432
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,737
I prefer it, actually.

433
00:25:59,415 --> 00:26:01,713
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

434
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:04,012
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.

435
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,555
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

436
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:12,418
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

437
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:14,189
Good luck with your car.

438
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:17,656
All right.

439
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:19,700
Walking's healthy, right?

440
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:23,064
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

441
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:25,736
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

442
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:28,674
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

443
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:33,245
<i>Baby come back
any kind of fool could see</i>

444
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:34,609
Hey!

445
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,646
<i>There was something
in everything about you</i>

446
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:43,848
<i>Baby come back
you can blame it all on me</i>

447
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,290
Hey!

448
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:49,557
Wait a second!

449
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:53,190
<i>I was wrong
and I just can't live without you</i>

450
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:56,361
There it is.

451
00:26:57,006 --> 00:27:00,840
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

452
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,574
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

453
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:09,875
I think you're... No, no, no.

454
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,585
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

455
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:17,525
Okay.

456
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:19,494
Yeah.

457
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:22,120
All right, I'll see you at school.

458
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:23,289
All right.

459
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:30,671
That's stupid.

460
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:32,030
That was a stupid line.

461
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:34,939
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

462
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:38,711
Oh, God.

463
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:41,707
Oh, my God. I love my car.

464
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:58,257
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

465
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:02,030
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

466
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:05,903
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

467
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:08,603
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

468
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,112
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

469
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:16,275
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,</i>

470
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:18,580
<i>we'll know just what to do with them.</i>

471
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,283
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:39,699
<i>Apparently, there are
very few survivors.</i>

473
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,002
Yes, Mr. President?

474
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,045
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

475
00:28:56,191 --> 00:29:00,252
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:26,588
Shoot.

477
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:42,293
Gross.

478
00:30:09,498 --> 00:30:11,159
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:15,694
Are you getting this?

480
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,332
I think they're hacking
the network again.

481
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:36,683
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

482
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:38,623
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

483
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,718
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.

484
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,138
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

485
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:55,767
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:57,742
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

487
00:30:57,846 --> 00:31:00,371
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

488
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:03,679
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:05,309
Code Red. We have a breach.

490
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,150
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

491
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:11,021
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

492
00:31:15,631 --> 00:31:17,030
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

493
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:20,260
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

494
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:23,065
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

495
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:27,164
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,594
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,166
What the...

498
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,040
<i>Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

499
00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:03,976
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

500
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:24,055
I want our President in that bunker.

501
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:28,193
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:31,397
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:32,632
Air Force One is on the ground.

504
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:39,367
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

505
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,766
That's my car!

506
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:44,542
No!

507
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:47,773
No, no, no, no.

508
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:57,416
Dad, call the cops!

509
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:02,322
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

510
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:06,162
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

511
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:09,726
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

512
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,636
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

513
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:15,403
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

514
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:49,601
Oh, my God.

515
00:35:06,027 --> 00:35:07,426
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:11,465
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

517
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:14,296
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

518
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:16,768
<i>and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.</i>

519
00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:18,863
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

520
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:21,602
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

521
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,678
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

522
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:37,484
No! No! No! No!

523
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:42,394
Oh, my God.

524
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:45,489
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

525
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,792
Oh, my God.

526
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:54,804
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

527
00:35:57,712 --> 00:35:59,077
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

528
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,513
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

529
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,753
Listen, listen, listen.

530
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:08,186
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

531
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,848
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

532
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:13,018
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

533
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:16,692
Put your head on the hood.

534
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:32,708
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

535
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:35,339
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

536
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,077
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

537
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:40,313
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:43,050
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

539
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:45,149
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

540
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,785
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

541
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:48,954
It's become the system.

542
00:36:49,064 --> 00:36:52,227
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

543
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,926
The only countries
with this kind of capability

544
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:56,333
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

545
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:59,373
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

546
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:01,704
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,641
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:06,873
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

549
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:10,012
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

550
00:37:10,118 --> 00:37:12,746
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

551
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:15,516
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,353
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:19,927
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

554
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:22,360
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

555
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:25,956
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

556
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:29,434
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

557
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:31,801
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:34,101
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

559
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:36,541
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

560
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:39,136
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:41,647
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,413
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

563
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:48,447
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

564
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:50,888
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

565
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:53,483
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:57,531
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

567
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:06,440
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

568
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:09,708
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

569
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:12,941
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:38:13,948 --> 00:38:15,176
Okay, chiefie.

571
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,347
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:20,252
What are you rolling?

573
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:22,687
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:25,157
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

575
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,758
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:32,625
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:36,363
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

578
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:41,603
What was that?

579
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:46,441
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

580
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:51,073
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

581
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:54,383
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:57,019
Are you on drugs?

583
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,830
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:12,839
Hey, heads up!

585
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:16,570
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

586
00:39:21,516 --> 00:39:23,484
What the heck was that?

587
00:39:28,156 --> 00:39:30,488
English, dude. English.

588
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:38,024
Whoa!

589
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,190
Watch out!

590
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:48,942
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!

591
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:50,101
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

592
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:52,338
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

593
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:02,852
Get up! Get up! Come on!

594
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:11,761
Go! Move it!

595
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:26,172
Take cover!

596
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,541
Fig! Cover the rear!

597
00:40:31,186 --> 00:40:36,089
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

598
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:39,217
Come on! Give me a mag!

599
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:42,053
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

600
00:40:42,163 --> 00:40:43,255
Papa!

601
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:46,128
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

602
00:40:46,234 --> 00:40:48,600
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!

603
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:50,295
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

604
00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:51,667
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

605
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:52,740
Fire!

606
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:56,535
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

607
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:59,135
It's an emergency Pentagon...

608
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:03,142
I don't have a credit card!

609
00:41:03,618 --> 00:41:07,349
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

610
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:10,151
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

611
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:14,558
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

612
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:17,194
Ammo!

613
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:19,927
I need a credit card!

614
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:24,667
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

615
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:28,036
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

616
00:41:28,142 --> 00:41:32,340
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

617
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:35,342
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

618
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,441
Okay, it's Visa.

619
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:38,947
Also, sir, have you heard about

620
00:41:39,053 --> 00:41:41,146
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

621
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:46,387
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

622
00:41:49,397 --> 00:41:50,659
Give me a status.

623
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:53,626
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

624
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:55,430
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

625
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:56,503
Survivors?

626
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:02,002
I ain't never seen this in my life!

627

We're linking the call
to the nearest AWACS.

630

Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...

631
00:42:16,224 --> 00:42:18,852
Predator ETA two minutes.

632
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:29,569
Hey! Make way!

633
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:36,501
- What is that?
- I don't know.

634
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:43,478
We need air support
and we need it now.

635
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:46,678
Roll in strike package Bravo

Laze target!

I am sorry to bother you.

671
00:45:41,496 --> 00:45:43,123
- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.

672
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:47,224
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

673
00:45:47,335 --> 00:45:48,996
- Listen to me.
- Glen! Who is it?

674
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:51,230
Shut up, Grandma!

675
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:53,773
- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?

676
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,968
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

677
00:46:00,948 --> 00:46:03,473
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.

678
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,982
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

679
00:46:12,593 --> 00:46:15,426
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?

680
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,361
Yeah. Get low.

681
00:46:17,698 --> 00:46:21,634
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

682
00:46:21,736 --> 00:46:23,567
Hey. I need a moment.

683
00:46:24,572 --> 00:46:25,903
- Please.
- Sorry.

684
00:46:26,474 --> 00:46:28,066
Hey, man, save my game.

685
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:30,041
How classified?

686
00:46:31,379 --> 00:46:35,440
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

687
00:46:35,716 --> 00:46:37,684
Yes! One quick peek.

688
00:46:38,486 --> 00:46:41,649
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

689
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:44,281
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

690
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:45,950
The rangers are en route
with the imager,

691
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,960
but we also have a security issue.

692
00:46:48,062 --> 00:46:50,326
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

693
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:52,092
of the network intrusion signal.

694
00:46:55,102 --> 00:46:58,401
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

695
00:46:58,506 --> 00:47:00,838
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

696
00:47:00,942 --> 00:47:02,500
in less than a minute.

697
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,805
- No way.
- Yeah.

698
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,717
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

699
00:47:16,857 --> 00:47:18,415
"Project Iceman"?

700
00:47:18,526 --> 00:47:21,927
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

701
00:47:23,464 --> 00:47:25,796
Are you playing
those video games again?

702
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,991
Cops! Cops!

703
00:47:28,102 --> 00:47:30,798
FBI! Clear right!

704
00:47:32,573 --> 00:47:34,734
Lock it down! Lock it down!

705
00:47:36,444 --> 00:47:37,411
Cops!

706
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:38,838
Lock it down.

707
00:47:38,946 --> 00:47:42,438
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

708
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:47,112
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

709
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,848
Especially police!

710
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:52,221
<i>It was an awesome spectacle here

713
00:47:58,966 --> 00:47:59,955

00:48:04,205 --> 00:48:05,729
<i>towards North Korea.</i>

717
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,707
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

718
00:48:12,313 --> 00:48:14,076
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

719
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:17,207
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?

720
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:20,219
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

721
00:48:28,095 --> 00:48:29,119
Stop!

722
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:30,959
No, no, no, no, no, no.

723
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:38,597
Oh, my God!

725
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:44,478
Hi.

726
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:48,044
That was... That was really awesome.

727
00:48:48,149 --> 00:48:50,242
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?

728
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:52,342
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

729
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:54,318
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

730
00:48:54,422 --> 00:48:56,652
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

731
00:49:29,557 --> 00:49:31,115
Oh, great. Cops.

732
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,424

Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...

Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

742

743
00:50:22,843 --> 00:50:24,242
Okay.

744
00:50:29,784 --> 00:50:31,251
Oh, God, no! No!

745
00:50:33,187 --> 00:50:38,625
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

746
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:43,425
It's a bad dream.

00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:47,062
Are you username LadiesMan217?

00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:34,679
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

761
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:36,875
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

762
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:41,353
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

763
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,298
Go, go, go, go!

764
00:51:58,906 --> 00:52:00,703
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

765
00:52:00,808 --> 00:52:02,366
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

766
00:52:02,476 --> 00:52:04,774
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

767
00:52:05,412 --> 00:52:06,811
Oh, my God! No!

768
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:08,211
We're gonna die!

769
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:15,620
Oh, my God!

770
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,166
We're locked in.

771
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:40,113
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

772
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,112
Okay.

773
00:52:48,722 --> 00:52:50,155
Time to start.

774
00:53:54,521 --> 00:53:55,818
He's got me! Oh, God!

775
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:04,228
He's going to kill me!

776
00:54:07,368 --> 00:54:09,029
No. No, no, no!

777
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:24,811
Get off!

778
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:40,490
Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:54:40,601 --> 00:54:42,159
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

780
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:50,977
Not so tough without a head, are you?

781
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,383
Here, come on.

782
00:55:13,233 --> 00:55:14,700
What is it?

783
00:55:16,103 --> 00:55:17,536
It's a robot.

784
00:55:18,939 --> 00:55:20,236
But like a...

785
00:55:20,374 --> 00:55:23,866
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

786
00:55:25,245 --> 00:55:26,678
It's probably Japanese.

787
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:29,180
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

788
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:32,479
What are you doing?

789
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,283
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

790
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,688
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

791
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:42,193
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

792
00:55:43,564 --> 00:55:46,727
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

793
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:49,325
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

794
00:55:50,204 --> 00:55:52,968
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

795
00:55:53,474 --> 00:55:55,635
<i>- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...</i>

796
00:55:55,743 --> 00:55:59,304
<i>Digital cable brings you...
... Columbia Broadcasting System...</i>

797
00:55:59,413 --> 00:56:01,176
So you... You talk through the radio?

798
00:56:01,281 --> 00:56:04,182
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.</i>

799
00:56:04,284 --> 00:56:06,275
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

800
00:56:06,386 --> 00:56:07,853
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain...</i>

801
00:56:07,955 --> 00:56:10,014
<i>Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...</i>

802
00:56:10,124 --> 00:56:12,092
<i>Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!</i>

803
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:14,319
Visitors from heaven? What...

804
00:56:14,428 --> 00:56:16,555
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

805
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:24,860
<i>Any more questions you want to ask?</i>

806
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:27,700
He wants us to get in the car.

807
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:30,209
And go where?

808
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:32,974
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

809
00:56:33,113 --> 00:56:36,173
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

810
00:57:05,646 --> 00:57:07,375
This car's a pretty good driver.

811
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:08,641
I know.

812
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:13,286
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

813
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,581
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

814
00:57:15,689 --> 00:57:16,747
Yeah.

815
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:19,659
You're right.

816
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:24,164
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

817
00:57:25,332 --> 00:57:29,098
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

818
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:32,570
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

819
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:34,231
- Yeah.
- Okay.

820
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:38,701
There, see? That's better.

821
00:57:39,012 --> 00:57:40,411
- Okay.
- Okay.

822
00:57:44,117 --> 00:57:47,484
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

823
00:57:48,555 --> 00:57:49,522
Thank you.

824
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,718
You know what I don't understand?

825
00:57:52,826 --> 00:57:55,886
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

826
00:57:55,996 --> 00:57:58,590
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

827
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:01,330
Whoa! Whoa!

828
00:58:01,435 --> 00:58:04,199
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

829
00:58:04,304 --> 00:58:05,362
Move it, you moron!

830
00:58:05,472 --> 00:58:07,497
Great, now... See?

831
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:10,035
Fantastic.

832
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:12,008
Now you pissed him off.

833
00:58:12,312 --> 00:58:13,779
That car is sensitive.

834
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:16,076
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

835
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:30,321
What?

836
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:35,459
This is you...

837
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,500
Oh, my God!

838
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:51,438
Come on, let's go.

839
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:59,547
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

840
00:59:59,653 --> 01:00:03,111
<i>This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!</i>

841
01:00:03,256 --> 01:00:05,451
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

842
01:00:19,439 --> 01:00:21,066
Whoa! Sweet!

843
01:00:21,174 --> 01:00:23,301
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

844
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,672
'cause he is so boned!

845
01:00:28,582 --> 01:00:29,913
What is that?

846
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,042
There's something in the tree, dude.

847
01:00:32,152 --> 01:00:34,279
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

848
01:00:34,388 --> 01:00:35,719
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

849
01:01:11,124 --> 01:01:13,615
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

850
01:01:14,895 --> 01:01:18,228
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

851
01:01:18,331 --> 01:01:20,822
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

852
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:57,558
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

853
01:02:58,732 --> 01:03:00,200
They know your name.

854
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:00,495
They know your name.

855
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:02,401
Yeah.

856
01:03:02,502 --> 01:03:04,936
My name is Optimus Prime.

857
01:03:05,038 --> 01:03:09,099
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

858
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:12,576
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

859
01:03:12,779 --> 01:03:18,046
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

860
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:21,678
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

861
01:03:22,255 --> 01:03:24,120
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

862
01:03:24,224 --> 01:03:27,819
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

863
01:03:29,329 --> 01:03:31,797
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

864
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:36,260
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

865
01:03:36,369 --> 01:03:39,600
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

866
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,001
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

867
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:47,239
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

868
01:03:49,649 --> 01:03:52,982
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

869
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,881
Bumblebee, right?

870
01:03:54,988 --> 01:03:56,683
<i>Check on the rep
Yep, second to none</i>

871
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,156
So you're my guardian, huh?

872
01:03:59,259 --> 01:04:04,458
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

873
01:04:09,302 --> 01:04:10,667
Why are you here?

874
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:16,003
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

875
01:04:16,343 --> 01:04:17,776
Mega-what?

876
01:04:27,354 --> 01:04:32,951
<i>Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,</i>

877
01:04:34,027 --> 01:04:38,862
<i>until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.</i>

878
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:43,231
<i>All who defied them were destroyed.</i>

879
01:04:43,336 --> 01:04:49,434
<i>Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.</i>

880
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:56,406
<i>Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.</i>

881
01:04:57,584 --> 01:04:59,279
My grandfather.

882
01:04:59,386 --> 01:05:03,584
<i>It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.</i>

883
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:08,351
Come back!

884
01:05:10,897 --> 01:05:13,457
I think the dogs have found something.

885
01:05:14,534 --> 01:05:16,297
The ice is cracking!

886
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:28,705
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

887
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:31,440
I'm all right, lads!

888
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:35,247
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

889
01:05:42,629 --> 01:05:47,726
<i>Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.</i>

890
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:54,762
Men! We've made a discovery!

891
01:05:54,874 --> 01:05:59,277
<i>He accidentally activated
his navigation system.</i>

892
01:06:12,859 --> 01:06:18,695
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

893
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:20,823
How'd you know about his glasses?

894
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:23,164
- EBay.
- EBay.

895
01:06:23,269 --> 01:06:26,432
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

896
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:32,375
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

897
01:06:32,479 --> 01:06:35,880
And the human race
will be extinguished.

898
01:06:35,982 --> 01:06:41,443
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

899
01:06:44,657 --> 01:06:47,626
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

900
01:06:51,564 --> 01:06:55,000
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

901
01:06:55,101 --> 01:06:57,092
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

902
01:06:57,203 --> 01:06:58,465
Melted right through.

903
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:01,768
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

904
01:07:01,908 --> 01:07:04,103
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

905
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,405
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

906
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,805
- Heads up!
- Oh!

907
01:07:09,549 --> 01:07:12,211
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

908
01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:16,350
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

909
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:17,787
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

910
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:20,155
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

911
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,727
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

912
01:07:26,954 --> 01:07:28,649
You want that piece?

913
01:07:28,756 --> 01:07:32,055
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

914
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,219
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

915
01:07:34,328 --> 01:07:37,661
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

916
01:07:37,765 --> 01:07:40,325
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

917
01:07:40,434 --> 01:07:42,902
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

918
01:07:43,004 --> 01:07:46,838
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

919
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:48,101
It's me and you.

920
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:51,042
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

921
01:08:05,092 --> 01:08:08,118
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

922
01:08:08,229 --> 01:08:09,856
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

923
01:08:09,964 --> 01:08:11,955
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

924
01:08:12,066 --> 01:08:13,033
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

925
01:08:13,134 --> 01:08:15,364
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

926
01:08:15,469 --> 01:08:20,168
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

927
01:08:20,274 --> 01:08:21,241
Okay, so what?

928
01:08:21,342 --> 01:08:23,435
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

929
01:08:23,544 --> 01:08:25,239
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

930
01:08:25,346 --> 01:08:26,313
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

931
01:08:26,414 --> 01:08:30,248
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

932
01:08:32,553 --> 01:08:34,646
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

933
01:08:34,755 --> 01:08:36,347
See? So can I go home now?

934
01:08:36,457 --> 01:08:38,687
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

935
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:42,490
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

936
01:08:42,597 --> 01:08:44,929
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

937
01:08:45,032 --> 01:08:48,627
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

938
01:08:48,736 --> 01:08:50,465
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

939
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:52,869
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

940
01:08:52,974 --> 01:08:55,807
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...</i>

941
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,502
- What did he say?
- What?

942
01:08:57,612 --> 01:08:59,079
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

943
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:01,740
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

944
01:09:01,849 --> 01:09:03,248
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

945
01:09:08,623 --> 01:09:10,454
<i>Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...</i>

946
01:09:10,558 --> 01:09:11,752
<i>- Yeah!
- Call Sam.</i>

947
01:09:11,859 --> 01:09:13,417
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

948
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:14,824
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

949
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:17,454
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

950
01:09:17,565 --> 01:09:19,192
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

951
01:09:24,472 --> 01:09:25,905
I need you to stay here, all right?

952
01:09:26,007 --> 01:09:27,167
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

953
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:28,242
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

954
01:09:28,342 --> 01:09:29,331
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

955
01:09:29,443 --> 01:09:30,410
Five minutes, all right?

956
01:09:31,112 --> 01:09:34,081
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

957
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:36,149
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

958
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,877
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

959
01:09:37,985 --> 01:09:40,283
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

960
01:09:40,388 --> 01:09:44,051
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

961
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,716
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

962
01:09:45,826 --> 01:09:48,693
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

963
01:09:48,796 --> 01:09:51,356
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

964
01:09:51,465 --> 01:09:52,557
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

965
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,134
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

966
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:55,702
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

967
01:09:55,803 --> 01:09:57,168
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

968
01:09:57,271 --> 01:09:58,499
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

969
01:09:58,606 --> 01:10:00,506
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

970
01:10:00,608 --> 01:10:04,476
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

971
01:10:04,578 --> 01:10:06,944
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

972
01:10:07,048 --> 01:10:08,015
The...

973
01:10:09,984 --> 01:10:12,452
I love you. God, I love you

974
01:10:12,553 --> 01:10:14,282
just so much right now.

975
01:10:14,388 --> 01:10:15,821
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

976
01:10:15,923 --> 01:10:17,447
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

977
01:10:17,558 --> 01:10:19,389
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

978
01:10:19,493 --> 01:10:20,858
because you're such a swell guy.

979
01:10:20,962 --> 01:10:22,088
One more thing, huh?

980
01:10:22,196 --> 01:10:25,256
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

981
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,460
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

982
01:10:27,601 --> 01:10:30,866
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

983
01:10:30,972 --> 01:10:33,839
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

984
01:10:33,941 --> 01:10:36,375
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

985
01:10:36,477 --> 01:10:38,445
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

986
01:10:38,546 --> 01:10:41,379
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

987
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:46,643
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

988
01:10:46,754 --> 01:10:50,747
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

989
01:10:52,059 --> 01:10:54,425
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

990
01:10:55,029 --> 01:10:57,554
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

991
01:10:57,665 --> 01:11:00,429
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

992
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:03,332
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

993
01:11:03,437 --> 01:11:06,406
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

994
01:11:06,507 --> 01:11:07,701
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

995
01:11:07,808 --> 01:11:09,969
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

996
01:11:10,077 --> 01:11:13,274
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

997
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:16,077
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

998
01:11:17,585 --> 01:11:21,749
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

999
01:11:21,856 --> 01:11:23,346
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

1000
01:11:23,457 --> 01:11:25,015
That's all it is.

1001
01:11:25,126 --> 01:11:27,924
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1002
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:30,328
Okay, okay.

1003
01:11:31,532 --> 01:11:34,160
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1004
01:11:37,371 --> 01:11:38,929
Autobots, recon.

1005
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,469
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1006
01:11:43,577 --> 01:11:45,340
Got some ice on his nose.

1007
01:11:45,446 --> 01:11:47,880
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1008
01:11:47,982 --> 01:11:49,347
You did not.

1009
01:11:50,618 --> 01:11:52,745
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

1010
01:11:53,487 --> 01:11:56,047
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1011
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,752
Come on, come on.

1012
01:12:04,565 --> 01:12:07,659
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1013
01:12:07,768 --> 01:12:10,362
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1014
01:12:10,471 --> 01:12:12,132
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1015
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,230
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1016
01:12:15,609 --> 01:12:17,600
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

1017
01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:18,735
My glasses were in the bag.

1018
01:12:18,846 --> 01:12:20,677
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1019
01:12:20,781 --> 01:12:22,339
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1020
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:23,508
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1021
01:12:23,617 --> 01:12:25,812
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1022
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,855
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1023
01:12:28,956 --> 01:12:31,390
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1024
01:12:31,492 --> 01:12:32,925
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1025
01:12:33,027 --> 01:12:33,994
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

1026
01:12:34,095 --> 01:12:35,460
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1027
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:38,259
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1028
01:12:38,365 --> 01:12:40,299
I'm already stressed out enough.

1029
01:12:40,401 --> 01:12:41,891
Okay. What now?

1030
01:12:44,305 --> 01:12:47,741
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1031
01:12:47,842 --> 01:12:51,801
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1032
01:12:51,912 --> 01:12:52,901
Oh, God. Oh!

1033
01:12:53,013 --> 01:12:57,143
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.</i>

1034
01:12:57,251 --> 01:12:59,549
<i>My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

1035
01:13:01,021 --> 01:13:02,750
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1036
01:13:02,857 --> 01:13:05,792
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1037
01:13:05,893 --> 01:13:07,485
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1038
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:08,653
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1039
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:09,990
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1040
01:13:10,097 --> 01:13:12,088
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1041
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:13,666
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1042
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:15,325
We must have the glasses.

1043
01:13:15,436 --> 01:13:16,994
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1044
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:19,334
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1045
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,532
Keep searching.

1046
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:22,302
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1047
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:23,637
Ten minutes. Okay?

1048
01:13:23,744 --> 01:13:25,507
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1049
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:27,604
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1050
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:28,739
Calm down, calm down.

1051
01:13:28,849 --> 01:13:30,544
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1052
01:13:30,651 --> 01:13:33,313
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1053
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,285
Good? Good? Okay.

1054
01:13:35,389 --> 01:13:36,549
- Move!
- Get away!

1055
01:13:36,657 --> 01:13:38,352
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1056
01:13:38,459 --> 01:13:40,359
He wants us to be quiet.

1057
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:47,998
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1058
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:48,802
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1059
01:13:48,802 --> 01:13:51,965
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1060
01:13:52,072 --> 01:13:53,903
How did you get over there so fast?

1061
01:13:54,975 --> 01:13:56,738
Wow! That was tingly!

1062
01:13:57,378 --> 01:14:00,245
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

1063
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:07,110
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1064
01:14:09,523 --> 01:14:12,219
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1065
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,789
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1066
01:14:14,929 --> 01:14:16,624
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

1067
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:19,290
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1068
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,458
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1069
01:14:20,568 --> 01:14:22,468
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1070
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:23,730
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

1071
01:14:23,837 --> 01:14:24,895
How come the door's locked?

1072
01:14:25,005 --> 01:14:28,634
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1073
01:14:28,742 --> 01:14:29,936
You know he'll start counting

1074
01:14:30,044 --> 01:14:31,443
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1075
01:14:31,545 --> 01:14:32,534
Oh, dear.

1076
01:14:32,646 --> 01:14:34,375
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

1077
01:14:34,515 --> 01:14:35,880
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

1078
01:14:35,983 --> 01:14:36,950
- Oh, my.
- Two.

1079
01:14:37,051 --> 01:14:39,110
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1080
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:43,283
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1081
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:46,382
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1082
01:14:46,493 --> 01:14:48,085
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1083
01:14:48,195 --> 01:14:50,425
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1084
01:14:50,531 --> 01:14:52,396
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1085
01:14:52,499 --> 01:14:54,296
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1086
01:14:54,401 --> 01:14:55,891
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1087
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:57,265
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1088
01:14:57,371 --> 01:14:59,396
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1089
01:14:59,506 --> 01:15:00,871
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1090
01:15:01,008 --> 01:15:01,997
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1091
01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:03,474
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1092
01:15:03,577 --> 01:15:05,044
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

1093
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:06,578
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1094
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,046
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1095
01:15:09,149 --> 01:15:13,609
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1096
01:15:15,489 --> 01:15:16,547
- Judy.
- Was I...

1097
01:15:16,657 --> 01:15:17,624
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

1098
01:15:17,725 --> 01:15:19,056
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

1099
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:20,183
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1100
01:15:20,294 --> 01:15:21,818
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

1101
01:15:21,929 --> 01:15:24,762
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1102
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:28,494
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1103
01:15:28,602 --> 01:15:30,593
- Happy time?
...my special alone time...

1104
01:15:30,704 --> 01:15:31,671
- Stop.
- Mom.

1105
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:32,761
- Judy, stop.
...with myself.

1106
01:15:32,873 --> 01:15:33,897
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

1107
01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:36,306
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1108
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,435
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1109
01:15:38,545 --> 01:15:40,308
Oh, parents.

1110
01:15:41,215 --> 01:15:44,013
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1111
01:15:45,152 --> 01:15:48,713
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1112
01:15:48,822 --> 01:15:51,091
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1113
01:15:51,091 --> 01:15:51,455
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1114
01:15:51,558 --> 01:15:52,547
Oh, I hate these.

1115
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:53,922
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

1116
01:15:54,028 --> 01:15:55,052
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

1117
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:56,686
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

1118
01:15:56,797 --> 01:15:58,128
Can't you take safety seriously?

1119
01:15:58,232 --> 01:16:01,497
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1120
01:16:01,602 --> 01:16:04,503
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1121
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:13,102
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1122
01:16:13,213 --> 01:16:15,704
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1123
01:16:15,816 --> 01:16:18,046
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1124
01:16:18,152 --> 01:16:19,847
Trashed. Gone.

1125
01:16:20,154 --> 01:16:21,621
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1126
01:16:21,722 --> 01:16:23,747
The parents are very irritating.

1127
01:16:23,857 --> 01:16:25,552
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

1128
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:28,389
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1129
01:16:28,495 --> 01:16:29,689
What is with you?

1130
01:16:29,797 --> 01:16:33,130
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1131
01:16:33,233 --> 01:16:34,894
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

1132
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:37,402
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

1133
01:16:37,504 --> 01:16:39,301
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1134
01:16:40,074 --> 01:16:42,338
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1135
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:46,541
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1136
01:16:46,647 --> 01:16:49,514
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

1137
01:16:49,616 --> 01:16:52,676
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1138
01:16:52,786 --> 01:16:54,276
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1139
01:16:54,388 --> 01:16:55,548
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1140
01:17:12,906 --> 01:17:16,239
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1141
01:17:16,343 --> 01:17:18,334
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1142
01:17:18,445 --> 01:17:19,412
I want you to distract my parents

1143
01:17:19,513 --> 01:17:21,811
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

1144
01:17:27,755 --> 01:17:30,315
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1145
01:17:30,424 --> 01:17:32,449
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1146
01:17:32,559 --> 01:17:34,686
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1147
01:17:34,795 --> 01:17:37,320
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1148
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:38,557
It's Witwicky.

1149
01:17:38,665 --> 01:17:41,896
May I enter the premises, sir?

1150
01:17:42,002 --> 01:17:44,937
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1151
01:17:45,038 --> 01:17:46,005
What the heck is going on here?

1152
01:17:46,106 --> 01:17:48,233
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1153
01:17:48,342 --> 01:17:50,606
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1154
01:17:50,711 --> 01:17:52,144
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1155
01:17:52,246 --> 01:17:53,304
That's right. National security.

1156
01:17:53,414 --> 01:17:55,006
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1157
01:17:55,115 --> 01:17:57,481
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1158
01:17:57,584 --> 01:17:59,381
Could you stay off the grass?

1159
01:17:59,486 --> 01:18:00,919
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1160
01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:02,648
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1161
01:18:02,756 --> 01:18:05,987
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1162
01:18:06,093 --> 01:18:07,560
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1163
01:18:07,661 --> 01:18:08,992
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1164
01:18:09,096 --> 01:18:10,427
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1165
01:18:10,531 --> 01:18:12,692
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1166
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,826
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1167
01:18:15,936 --> 01:18:17,995
- No!
- What is this?

1168
01:18:18,105 --> 01:18:20,835
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

1169
01:18:20,941 --> 01:18:22,408
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

1170
01:18:22,509 --> 01:18:23,737
Whoa, way out of line.

1171
01:18:23,844 --> 01:18:27,871
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1172
01:18:27,981 --> 01:18:29,881
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1173
01:18:29,983 --> 01:18:31,041
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1174
01:18:31,151 --> 01:18:32,345
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1175
01:18:32,453 --> 01:18:34,648
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1176
01:18:34,755 --> 01:18:37,451
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

1177
01:18:37,558 --> 01:18:41,517
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1178
01:18:41,628 --> 01:18:43,858
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1179
01:18:43,964 --> 01:18:46,524
I think direct contact.

1180
01:18:51,972 --> 01:18:53,530
- Son?
- Yeah.

1181
01:18:54,608 --> 01:18:57,509
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

1182
01:19:03,283 --> 01:19:04,750
Fourteen rads.

1183
01:19:06,353 --> 01:19:07,820
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1184
01:19:08,555 --> 01:19:10,455
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1185
01:19:10,557 --> 01:19:12,252
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1186
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:13,883
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1187
01:19:13,994 --> 01:19:15,859
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1188
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:21,293
So,

1189
01:19:22,736 --> 01:19:26,194
LadiesMan217.

1190
01:19:26,306 --> 01:19:29,742
That is your eBay username, right?

1191
01:19:29,843 --> 01:19:32,175
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1192
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:33,246
What do you make of this?

1193
01:19:33,347 --> 01:19:35,907
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...</i>

1194
01:19:36,016 --> 01:19:37,142
Is that you?

1195
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:39,446
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1196
01:19:39,553 --> 01:19:44,388
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1197
01:19:45,726 --> 01:19:48,058
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

1198
01:19:48,161 --> 01:19:52,621
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1199
01:19:52,733 --> 01:19:54,860
- Really?
...from me, from my home,

1200
01:19:54,968 --> 01:19:57,937
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1201
01:19:58,038 --> 01:19:59,767
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1202
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:03,309
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1203
01:20:06,446 --> 01:20:08,038
That's funny. That is so funny.

1204
01:20:08,148 --> 01:20:10,639
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1205
01:20:11,818 --> 01:20:14,582
<i>Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T.? No.</i>

1206
01:20:14,688 --> 01:20:16,178
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1207
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:17,416
You see this?

1208
01:20:17,524 --> 01:20:20,118
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1209
01:20:20,227 --> 01:20:22,991
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1210
01:20:23,096 --> 01:20:24,324
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1211
01:20:24,431 --> 01:20:26,831
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1212
01:20:26,934 --> 01:20:29,994
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1213
01:20:30,103 --> 01:20:32,196
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1214
01:20:32,306 --> 01:20:33,705
What? Parole?

1215
01:20:33,807 --> 01:20:37,140
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1216
01:20:37,244 --> 01:20:39,235
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1217
01:20:39,346 --> 01:20:41,075
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1218
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:42,273
You stole cars?

1219
01:20:42,382 --> 01:20:44,077
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1220
01:20:44,184 --> 01:20:45,981
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1221
01:20:46,086 --> 01:20:48,384
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1222
01:20:48,488 --> 01:20:51,116
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1223
01:20:52,259 --> 01:20:56,889
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1224
01:20:56,997 --> 01:20:59,295
It is time to talk!

1225
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:07,472
Big! It's big!

1226
01:21:12,212 --> 01:21:14,180
Go, go, go, go!

1227
01:21:14,615 --> 01:21:17,243
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1228
01:21:17,351 --> 01:21:18,784
All right! All right!

1229
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:35,665
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1230
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:42,299
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1231
01:21:44,544 --> 01:21:48,310
Taking the children was a bad move.

1232
01:21:48,415 --> 01:21:51,816
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1233
01:21:55,422 --> 01:21:57,151
Freeze!

1234
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:59,190
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1235
01:21:59,292 --> 01:22:00,350
Whoa!

1236
01:22:01,795 --> 01:22:02,853
Whoa!

1237
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,971
Hi, there.

1238
01:22:15,275 --> 01:22:20,008
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1239
01:22:20,714 --> 01:22:25,651
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1240
01:22:26,253 --> 01:22:27,550
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1241
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:29,884
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1242
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:32,584
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1243
01:22:33,226 --> 01:22:34,352
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1244
01:22:34,461 --> 01:22:35,951
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1245
01:22:36,063 --> 01:22:39,430
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1246
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:43,025
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1247
01:22:43,136 --> 01:22:44,660
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1248
01:22:44,771 --> 01:22:45,760
How you doing?

1249
01:22:45,872 --> 01:22:47,601
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

1250
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,869
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1251
01:22:49,976 --> 01:22:53,139
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

1252
01:22:53,246 --> 01:22:57,012
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1253
01:22:57,617 --> 01:23:01,781
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1254
01:23:03,356 --> 01:23:05,017
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1255
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:07,992
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1256
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:10,586
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

1257
01:23:10,697 --> 01:23:12,927
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1258
01:23:13,033 --> 01:23:15,024
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1259
01:23:15,135 --> 01:23:17,000
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1260
01:23:17,104 --> 01:23:18,833
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1261
01:23:18,939 --> 01:23:21,772
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1262
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:25,072
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1263
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:31,317
Hey!

1264
01:23:31,418 --> 01:23:34,353
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1265
01:23:34,454 --> 01:23:36,513
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1266
01:23:37,858 --> 01:23:41,157
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1267
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:43,957
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

1268
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:47,029
For threatening my dad.

1269
01:23:50,103 --> 01:23:56,008
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1270
01:23:57,778 --> 01:23:59,439
You're a criminal.

1271
01:24:00,113 --> 01:24:02,911
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1272
01:24:04,384 --> 01:24:07,217
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1273
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,309
All right.

1274
01:24:08,421 --> 01:24:10,514
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1275
01:24:12,559 --> 01:24:14,459
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

1276
01:24:14,594 --> 01:24:16,755
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1277
01:24:16,863 --> 01:24:18,125
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1278
01:24:18,231 --> 01:24:22,668
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1279
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:31,143
Optimus! Incoming!

1280
01:24:38,852 --> 01:24:40,080
Roll out.

1281
01:24:46,993 --> 01:24:50,326
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.</i>

1282
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,601
<i>Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.</i>

1283
01:24:56,703 --> 01:24:58,034
Up you get.

1284
01:25:02,742 --> 01:25:04,710
<i>Okay, we're dropping in.</i>

1285
01:25:08,748 --> 01:25:11,342
<i>Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.</i>

1286
01:25:11,451 --> 01:25:13,612
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

1287
01:25:14,688 --> 01:25:17,316
<i>That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.</i>

1288
01:25:17,424 --> 01:25:20,689
<i>Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.</i>

1289
01:25:21,228 --> 01:25:22,786
<i>I got it. 12:00.</i>

1290
01:25:26,867 --> 01:25:28,300
<i>Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.</i>

1291
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:33,466
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

1292
01:25:37,077 --> 01:25:41,639
<i>Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?</i>

1293
01:25:41,982 --> 01:25:44,143
<i>Okay, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

1294
01:25:44,718 --> 01:25:46,709
<i>Okay, we're coming around.</i>

1295
01:26:09,409 --> 01:26:10,933
Easy, you two.

1296
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,551
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1297
01:26:24,224 --> 01:26:27,216
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1298
01:26:28,461 --> 01:26:30,520
- Hold on!
- No!

1299
01:26:34,234 --> 01:26:35,462
Sam!

1300
01:26:41,074 --> 01:26:44,202
<i>All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.</i>

1301
01:26:44,311 --> 01:26:45,573
<i>I'm in for the shot.</i>

1302
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,112
Stop! Stop!

1303
01:26:48,315 --> 01:26:50,112
Wait! No!

1304
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:56,080
<i>- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.</i>

1305
01:26:56,656 --> 01:26:57,850
No!

1306
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:16,033
No! Stop!

1307
01:27:16,643 --> 01:27:17,940
Stop!

1308
01:27:18,545 --> 01:27:21,981
<i>Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!</i>

1309
01:27:22,983 --> 01:27:24,314
What? Okay.

1310
01:27:26,186 --> 01:27:28,347
Look, he's not fighting back!

1311
01:27:28,955 --> 01:27:31,150
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1312
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:39,088
Stop hurting him!

1313
01:27:48,508 --> 01:27:50,203
Don't let him move!

1314
01:27:50,944 --> 01:27:52,502
I got him here!

1315
01:28:15,702 --> 01:28:16,760
No!

1316
01:28:20,774 --> 01:28:22,571
Happy to see me again?

1317
01:28:24,077 --> 01:28:26,807
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1318
01:28:32,685 --> 01:28:35,745
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1319
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:46,194
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1320
01:28:49,035 --> 01:28:50,434
Optimus,

1321
01:28:52,772 --> 01:28:55,240
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1322
01:28:55,341 --> 01:28:59,038
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1323
01:28:59,145 --> 01:29:01,943
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1324
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,326
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1325
01:29:16,429 --> 01:29:17,555
in the western Pacific.

1326
01:29:17,664 --> 01:29:19,859
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1327
01:29:19,966 --> 01:29:22,730
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1328
01:29:27,073 --> 01:29:29,940
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1329
01:29:30,043 --> 01:29:31,374
of cruise missile range.

1330
01:29:31,478 --> 01:29:35,005
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1331
01:29:35,115 --> 01:29:37,083
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

1332
01:29:39,486 --> 01:29:44,549
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1333
01:29:44,657 --> 01:29:47,854
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

1334
01:29:50,997 --> 01:29:53,488
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1335
01:29:57,137 --> 01:29:59,799
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1336
01:29:59,906 --> 01:30:02,306
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

1337
01:30:02,408 --> 01:30:04,069
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1338
01:30:04,177 --> 01:30:06,611
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1339
01:30:07,647 --> 01:30:08,614
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1340
01:30:08,715 --> 01:30:11,707
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1341
01:30:11,818 --> 01:30:12,910
The blackout's global.

1342
01:30:13,019 --> 01:30:15,852
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1343
01:30:15,955 --> 01:30:20,483
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1344
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:30,732
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1345
01:30:32,739 --> 01:30:35,105
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1346
01:30:38,178 --> 01:30:39,736
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1347
01:30:39,846 --> 01:30:41,939
you won't understand right away.

1348
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,381
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1349
01:30:45,485 --> 01:30:48,886
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1350
01:30:49,756 --> 01:30:53,852
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1351
01:30:54,961 --> 01:30:59,227
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1352
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:02,099
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1353
01:31:02,702 --> 01:31:05,227
This was classified above top secret.

1354
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,848
<i>EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.</i>

1355
01:31:22,956 --> 01:31:25,584
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1356
01:31:26,859 --> 01:31:28,952
This is the image from Mars.

1357
01:31:29,796 --> 01:31:32,560
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1358
01:31:32,665 --> 01:31:34,428
from the base attack.

1359
01:31:35,201 --> 01:31:38,295
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1360
01:31:39,172 --> 01:31:41,936
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1361
01:31:42,342 --> 01:31:45,004
Are we talking about an invasion?

1362
01:31:45,111 --> 01:31:48,205
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1363
01:31:48,314 --> 01:31:51,647
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1364
01:31:51,751 --> 01:31:53,480
That's why the virus shut us down,

1365
01:31:53,586 --> 01:31:56,885
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1366
01:31:56,990 --> 01:32:01,484
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1367
01:32:05,365 --> 01:32:07,697
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1368
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,201
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1369
01:32:11,304 --> 01:32:14,637
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1370
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:17,710
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1371
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,185
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1372
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:32,258
Let's go!

1373
01:32:37,297 --> 01:32:38,787
She's in here.

1374
01:32:39,165 --> 01:32:40,826
What's going on?

1375
01:32:41,367 --> 01:32:43,198
You're coming with me.

1376
01:32:43,636 --> 01:32:46,332
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?

1377
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:48,671
Who's this?

1378
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:52,536
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.

1379
01:33:03,823 --> 01:33:06,314
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1380
01:33:07,393 --> 01:33:11,659
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1381
01:33:11,764 --> 01:33:12,731
Wow.

1382
01:33:13,399 --> 01:33:14,525
Who knew?

1383
01:33:31,317 --> 01:33:33,217
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1384
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:46,760
Please, let this work.

1385
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:50,067
Fire it up, Optimus.

1386
01:33:51,037 --> 01:33:52,527
The code.

1387
01:33:52,638 --> 01:33:58,042
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1388
01:33:59,846 --> 01:34:03,646
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1389
01:34:04,817 --> 01:34:06,580
They must know it's here, as well.

1390
01:34:06,686 --> 01:34:08,017
What about Bumblebee?

1391
01:34:08,121 --> 01:34:12,182
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1392
01:34:12,291 --> 01:34:16,284
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1393
01:34:16,396 --> 01:34:20,628
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1394
01:34:20,733 --> 01:34:23,668
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1395
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:28,438
<i>They're a primitive and violent race.</i>

1396
01:34:30,777 --> 01:34:32,768
Were we so different?

1397
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:38,048
<i>They're a young species.
They have much to learn.</i>

1398
01:34:38,151 --> 01:34:40,949
<i>But I've seen goodness in them.</i>

1399
01:34:41,053 --> 01:34:45,217
<i>Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.</i>

1400
01:34:45,324 --> 01:34:49,556
<i>You all know there's only one way
to end this war.</i>

1401
01:34:49,662 --> 01:34:52,358
<i>We must destroy the Cube.</i>

1402
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:57,728
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1403
01:34:57,837 --> 01:34:59,168
That's suicide.

1404
01:34:59,272 --> 01:35:03,072
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1405
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:07,636
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1406
01:35:07,747 --> 01:35:11,046
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1407
01:35:12,518 --> 01:35:15,214
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1408
01:35:15,321 --> 01:35:19,121
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

1409
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:34,333
Team attention! Present arms!

1410
01:35:35,007 --> 01:35:39,239
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1411
01:35:39,345 --> 01:35:41,040
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1412
01:35:41,147 --> 01:35:43,274
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1413
01:35:43,382 --> 01:35:44,644
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1414
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:47,844
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1415
01:35:49,355 --> 01:35:50,583
Hey, kid.

1416
01:35:51,657 --> 01:35:54,319
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1417
01:35:54,861 --> 01:35:55,953
You must be hungry?

1418
01:35:56,062 --> 01:35:58,053
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1419
01:35:58,164 --> 01:35:59,791
Where's my car?

1420
01:35:59,899 --> 01:36:03,460
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1421
01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:05,665
People can die here.

1422
01:36:06,038 --> 01:36:08,734
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1423
01:36:08,841 --> 01:36:10,035
Okay.

1424
01:36:10,142 --> 01:36:13,873
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1425
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:18,679
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1426
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,288
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1427
01:36:23,389 --> 01:36:24,686
Thank you.

1428
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:27,887
The man's an extortionist.

1429
01:36:29,629 --> 01:36:30,960
All right, here's the situation.

1430
01:36:31,063 --> 01:36:33,463
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1431
01:36:33,566 --> 01:36:34,658
NBEs?

1432
01:36:34,767 --> 01:36:38,362
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1433
01:36:38,471 --> 01:36:42,100
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1434
01:36:51,284 --> 01:36:51,851
Dear God. What is this?

1435
01:36:51,851 --> 01:36:53,113
Dear God. What is this?

1436
01:36:54,687 --> 01:36:57,952
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1437
01:36:58,057 --> 01:37:01,493
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1438
01:37:01,594 --> 01:37:05,587
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1439
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:08,963
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1440
01:37:09,068 --> 01:37:11,468
We call him NBE One.

1441
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:13,937
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1442
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,440
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1443
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:19,541
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1444
01:37:19,645 --> 01:37:22,978
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1445
01:37:23,082 --> 01:37:26,540
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1446
01:37:26,652 --> 01:37:28,085
in the history of mankind.

1447
01:37:28,187 --> 01:37:31,122
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1448
01:37:31,223 --> 01:37:38,061
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1449
01:37:38,164 --> 01:37:41,964
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1450
01:37:42,535 --> 01:37:45,163
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1451
01:37:45,271 --> 01:37:47,637
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1452
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:51,733
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1453
01:37:51,844 --> 01:37:53,709
Well, you got one now.

1454
01:37:54,647 --> 01:37:57,047
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1455
01:37:57,149 --> 01:37:58,673
All Spark? What is that?

1456
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:01,344
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1457
01:38:01,454 --> 01:38:06,221
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

1458
01:38:06,325 --> 01:38:08,759
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1459
01:38:08,861 --> 01:38:11,955
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1460
01:38:12,064 --> 01:38:13,588
That's their plan.

1461
01:38:13,699 --> 01:38:16,099
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1462
01:38:18,437 --> 01:38:20,701
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1463
01:38:22,141 --> 01:38:23,267
Follow me.

1464
01:38:26,912 --> 01:38:29,403
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1465
01:38:38,357 --> 01:38:41,918
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1466
01:38:42,828 --> 01:38:46,457
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1467
01:38:47,299 --> 01:38:51,167
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1468
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:52,794
as well as NBE One.

1469
01:38:52,905 --> 01:38:55,465
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1470
01:38:55,574 --> 01:38:57,940
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1471
01:38:58,044 --> 01:39:01,377
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1472
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:05,075
or any alien species on the outside.

1473
01:39:43,889 --> 01:39:47,689
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1474
01:39:48,327 --> 01:39:50,818
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1475
01:39:55,401 --> 01:39:58,268
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1476
01:40:04,176 --> 01:40:05,837
Oh, wow.

1477
01:40:05,945 --> 01:40:07,970
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1478
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,274
Oh, no, man.

1479
01:40:09,415 --> 01:40:13,875
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1480
01:40:13,986 --> 01:40:16,921
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1481
01:40:18,457 --> 01:40:21,483
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1482
01:40:21,594 --> 01:40:23,027
I got a phone.

1483
01:40:26,232 --> 01:40:28,826
Nokias are real nasty.

1484
01:40:28,934 --> 01:40:33,371
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1485
01:40:34,173 --> 01:40:36,300
Nokia's from Finland.

1486
01:40:36,408 --> 01:40:40,970
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1487
01:40:43,749 --> 01:40:49,312
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1488
01:41:03,002 --> 01:41:06,301
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

1489
01:41:06,405 --> 01:41:10,068
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1490
01:41:21,086 --> 01:41:22,951
He's breaking the box.

1491
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:42,066
Go! Go! Go!

1492
01:41:42,174 --> 01:41:43,266
Move!

1493
01:41:51,817 --> 01:41:54,445
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1494
01:41:55,221 --> 01:41:56,552
Banachek. What's going on?

1495
01:41:56,655 --> 01:41:58,486
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1496
01:41:58,591 --> 01:41:59,649
<i>- What?
...and the backup generator</i>

1497
01:41:59,758 --> 01:42:01,726
<i>- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?</i>

1498
01:42:08,133 --> 01:42:09,896
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1499
01:42:10,002 --> 01:42:11,401
I'll bring security to the...

1500
01:42:11,503 --> 01:42:14,028
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1501
01:42:14,139 --> 01:42:15,731
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1502
01:42:15,841 --> 01:42:17,206
Let's go!

1503
01:42:17,309 --> 01:42:19,072
They're popping our generators!

1504
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:32,455
Megatron melting!

1505
01:42:33,092 --> 01:42:36,152
<i>16502. We're losing pressure.</i>

1506
01:42:36,262 --> 01:42:38,457
Stand by! Set!

1507
01:42:38,564 --> 01:42:40,623
<i>We're losing pressure!</i>

1508
01:42:40,733 --> 01:42:44,169
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!</i>

1509
01:42:48,908 --> 01:42:51,604
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1510
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:55,703
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1511
01:43:01,253 --> 01:43:03,881
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1512
01:43:03,989 --> 01:43:05,013
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1513
01:43:05,124 --> 01:43:07,058
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1514
01:43:07,159 --> 01:43:08,888
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1515
01:43:08,994 --> 01:43:10,256
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1516
01:43:10,362 --> 01:43:11,727
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1517
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:13,821
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1518
01:43:13,933 --> 01:43:15,662
Take him to his car!

1519
01:43:17,403 --> 01:43:18,597
Drop it.

1520
01:43:20,372 --> 01:43:22,033
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1521
01:43:23,309 --> 01:43:25,300
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1522
01:43:25,811 --> 01:43:27,540
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1523
01:43:27,646 --> 01:43:28,670
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1524
01:43:28,781 --> 01:43:30,976
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1525
01:43:31,083 --> 01:43:32,243
S-Seven don't exist.

1526
01:43:32,351 --> 01:43:34,114
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1527
01:43:34,219 --> 01:43:37,484
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1528
01:43:40,092 --> 01:43:41,719
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

1529
01:43:41,827 --> 01:43:45,888
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1530
01:43:50,402 --> 01:43:52,370
All right. Okay.

1531
01:43:52,471 --> 01:43:57,101
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1532
01:44:00,546 --> 01:44:01,808
No, no!

1533
01:44:02,781 --> 01:44:05,443
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1534
01:44:05,551 --> 01:44:09,112
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1535
01:44:10,322 --> 01:44:11,721
Are you okay?

1536
01:44:13,592 --> 01:44:15,685
They didn't hurt you, right?

1537
01:44:24,436 --> 01:44:28,236
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1538
01:44:30,642 --> 01:44:32,735
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1539
01:44:32,845 --> 01:44:35,075
They're not gonna hurt you.

1540
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:38,707
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1541
01:44:38,817 --> 01:44:42,082
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1542
01:44:42,187 --> 01:44:43,677
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1543
01:45:05,744 --> 01:45:09,236
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1544
01:45:29,368 --> 01:45:30,699
Oh, my God.

1545
01:45:35,507 --> 01:45:36,906
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

1546
01:45:37,009 --> 01:45:38,408
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

1547
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:41,536
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1548
01:45:41,647 --> 01:45:43,046
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1549
01:45:43,148 --> 01:45:44,445
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1550
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:45,949
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1551
01:45:46,051 --> 01:45:47,018
Good! Right.

1552
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:49,849
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1553
01:45:49,955 --> 01:45:52,014
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1554
01:45:52,124 --> 01:45:53,989
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

1555
01:45:54,093 --> 01:45:56,687
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1556
01:45:56,795 --> 01:45:58,228
In the alien archive, sir!

1557
01:45:58,330 --> 01:46:00,321
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1558
01:46:00,432 --> 01:46:01,956
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1559
01:46:02,067 --> 01:46:04,501
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1560
01:46:04,603 --> 01:46:06,366
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1561
01:46:06,472 --> 01:46:08,099
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1562
01:46:08,207 --> 01:46:10,175
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1563
01:46:10,275 --> 01:46:11,799
Affirmative!

1564
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:15,744
<i>Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.</i>

1565
01:46:16,748 --> 01:46:18,613
Check that backup system!

1566
01:46:18,717 --> 01:46:22,881
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1567
01:46:22,988 --> 01:46:24,478
Come on! Get out of here!

1568
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:26,114
Heads up! Look out!

1569
01:46:27,126 --> 01:46:29,526
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1570
01:46:29,628 --> 01:46:33,064
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

1571
01:46:42,774 --> 01:46:45,834
I am Megatron!

1572
01:47:04,663 --> 01:47:06,062
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1573
01:47:06,165 --> 01:47:07,154
Well, put the seat belt on.

1574
01:47:07,266 --> 01:47:08,426
Pour it on him!

1575
01:47:22,181 --> 01:47:24,172
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1576
01:47:24,283 --> 01:47:26,683
Where is the Cube?

1577
01:47:26,785 --> 01:47:28,844
The humans have taken it.

1578
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:36,092
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1579
01:47:36,528 --> 01:47:37,995
Come on, Mags!

1580
01:47:39,097 --> 01:47:40,587
Over here, sir!

1581
01:47:42,935 --> 01:47:44,994
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1582
01:47:45,103 --> 01:47:47,537
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1583
01:47:49,441 --> 01:47:52,899
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1584
01:47:53,946 --> 01:47:54,935
Mikes?

1585
01:47:55,047 --> 01:47:56,309
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1586
01:47:56,415 --> 01:47:57,973
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1587
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,607
Let's find them.

1588
01:47:59,718 --> 01:48:01,185
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1589
01:48:01,286 --> 01:48:03,447
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

1590
01:48:03,555 --> 01:48:06,615
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1591
01:48:06,725 --> 01:48:08,022
- Glen?
- Huh?

1592
01:48:08,126 --> 01:48:11,618
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1593
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:12,719
What good is that?

1594
01:48:12,831 --> 01:48:15,231
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1595
01:48:15,334 --> 01:48:18,895
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1596
01:48:19,004 --> 01:48:20,835
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1597
01:48:32,618 --> 01:48:34,142
There's Optimus.

1598
01:48:52,104 --> 01:48:53,571
Almost done.

1599
01:48:55,407 --> 01:48:57,307
What the hell was that?

1600
01:49:00,379 --> 01:49:02,074
Barricade the door!

1601
01:49:04,816 --> 01:49:07,182
- Get something.
- Watch out!

1602
01:49:07,286 --> 01:49:09,379
Six, five, four, six, three.

1603
01:49:14,059 --> 01:49:16,425
Here! Put some rounds in!

1604
01:49:19,298 --> 01:49:20,731
Master search.

1605
01:49:21,633 --> 01:49:23,624
I got it! We're transmitting!

1606
01:49:23,735 --> 01:49:24,861
Send exactly what I say!

1607
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:29,100
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1608
01:49:29,207 --> 01:49:33,234
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1609
01:49:33,345 --> 01:49:34,869
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1610
01:49:36,581 --> 01:49:37,605
What was that?

1611
01:49:37,716 --> 01:49:40,549
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1612
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:44,916
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1613
01:50:09,648 --> 01:50:11,616
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1614
01:50:11,717 --> 01:50:15,153
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

1615
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:37,364
Oh, my God.

1616
01:51:05,937 --> 01:51:07,268
Cool, Mom!

1617
01:51:33,165 --> 01:51:35,156
This is so not good.

1618
01:51:53,652 --> 01:51:55,517
He's behind the pillar!

1619
01:52:01,393 --> 01:52:04,487
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

1620
01:52:07,632 --> 01:52:09,964
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1621
01:52:13,839 --> 01:52:15,807
Sucker, burn!

1622
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:22,911
Oh, shit!

1623
01:52:23,248 --> 01:52:25,273
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1624
01:52:26,485 --> 01:52:28,510
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.</i>

1625
01:52:29,721 --> 01:52:31,985
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

1626
01:52:34,326 --> 01:52:35,793
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

1627
01:52:36,695 --> 01:52:38,856
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

1628
01:52:46,438 --> 01:52:49,999
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1629
01:52:50,108 --> 01:52:52,303
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1630
01:52:52,844 --> 01:52:55,039
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1631
01:52:55,146 --> 01:52:57,444
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1632
01:52:57,849 --> 01:53:00,841
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1633
01:53:00,952 --> 01:53:03,887
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1634
01:53:03,989 --> 01:53:06,685
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1635
01:53:07,292 --> 01:53:08,884
F-22 at 12:00.

1636
01:53:08,994 --> 01:53:11,690
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1637
01:53:11,796 --> 01:53:13,661
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1638
01:53:16,167 --> 01:53:18,567
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1639
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:20,497
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1640
01:53:21,773 --> 01:53:22,933
<i>We have you visual.</i>

1641
01:53:24,609 --> 01:53:25,940
<i>Green smoke is the mark.</i>

1642
01:53:26,044 --> 01:53:29,502
<i>Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.</i>

1643
01:53:34,152 --> 01:53:36,120
It's Starscream!

1644
01:53:36,588 --> 01:53:38,249
Please tell me you copy.

1645
01:53:38,590 --> 01:53:40,888
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1646
01:53:44,696 --> 01:53:46,664
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1647
01:53:46,765 --> 01:53:49,928
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1648
01:53:50,035 --> 01:53:51,263
Incoming!

1649
01:54:16,361 --> 01:54:18,158
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1650
01:54:18,263 --> 01:54:19,730
Clear the area!

1651
01:54:25,537 --> 01:54:27,061
Oh, my God.

1652
01:54:27,939 --> 01:54:30,806
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1653
01:54:31,242 --> 01:54:32,573
Your legs.

1654
01:54:34,145 --> 01:54:37,774
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1655
01:54:39,317 --> 01:54:41,751
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1656
01:54:43,321 --> 01:54:44,515
Ratchet!

1657
01:54:46,391 --> 01:54:47,858
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1658
01:54:47,959 --> 01:54:49,893
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

1659
01:54:49,995 --> 01:54:52,361
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1660
01:54:52,464 --> 01:54:54,625
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1661
01:54:54,733 --> 01:54:57,531
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1662
01:54:58,803 --> 01:54:59,827
Come on!

1663
01:54:59,938 --> 01:55:02,065
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.</i>

1664
01:55:03,842 --> 01:55:05,969
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1665
01:55:06,077 --> 01:55:08,409
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1666
01:55:26,631 --> 01:55:28,064
Move out! Let's go!

1667
01:55:34,506 --> 01:55:36,201
Let's go! Move!

1668
01:55:42,814 --> 01:55:44,475
I'm not gonna leave you.

1669
01:56:23,588 --> 01:56:25,613
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1670
01:56:31,930 --> 01:56:33,454
Oh, my God!

1671
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:47,944
Concentrate your fire!

1672
01:56:58,857 --> 01:57:00,051
Come on. Come on.

1673
01:57:02,627 --> 01:57:04,322
Megatron!

1674
01:57:09,033 --> 01:57:12,696
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1675
01:57:16,975 --> 01:57:18,567
Fall back!

1676
01:57:24,582 --> 01:57:26,777
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1677
01:57:26,885 --> 01:57:28,910
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1678
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:31,284
We need air cover down here now!

1679
01:57:37,295 --> 01:57:38,694
Sam, help me with this.

1680
01:57:42,867 --> 01:57:47,201
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

1681
01:57:47,305 --> 01:57:49,398
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1682
01:57:49,507 --> 01:57:51,805
No! I want two!

1683
01:57:53,378 --> 01:57:54,777
What's going on?

1684
01:57:56,581 --> 01:57:59,209
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1685
01:58:00,084 --> 01:58:02,348
Oh, these things just don't die.

1686
01:58:05,924 --> 01:58:07,414
Oh, we're so dead.

1687
01:58:07,525 --> 01:58:09,857
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1688
01:58:10,161 --> 01:58:11,150
Where's the Cube?

1689
01:58:11,262 --> 01:58:12,229
- Right there.
- Okay.

1690
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:13,319
And take that and wrap it around

1691
01:58:13,431 --> 01:58:14,398
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1692
01:58:14,499 --> 01:58:17,161
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1693
01:58:18,603 --> 01:58:20,070
That building.

1694
01:58:23,842 --> 01:58:25,639
- Okay.
- What?

1695
01:58:25,743 --> 01:58:28,712
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1696
01:58:28,813 --> 01:58:31,077
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

1697
01:58:31,182 --> 01:58:33,377
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1698
01:58:33,484 --> 01:58:35,418
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

1699
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,923
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1700
01:58:40,024 --> 01:58:42,254
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1701
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:44,419
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1702
01:58:44,562 --> 01:58:46,052
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

1703
01:58:46,164 --> 01:58:47,324
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

1704
01:58:47,432 --> 01:58:50,128
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1705
01:58:51,603 --> 01:58:52,661
Army Black Hawk requested.

1706
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:55,295
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1707
01:58:55,406 --> 01:58:57,931
<i>Headed to rooftop marked by flare.</i>

1708
01:58:58,042 --> 01:59:01,136
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

1709
01:59:02,747 --> 01:59:06,080
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

1710
01:59:10,054 --> 01:59:14,184
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1711
01:59:17,428 --> 01:59:20,056
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1712
01:59:20,164 --> 01:59:23,395
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

1713
01:59:26,137 --> 01:59:28,230
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1714
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:35,976
Watch out!

1715
01:59:41,586 --> 01:59:44,612
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

1716
01:59:44,722 --> 01:59:46,383
Get out of here now!

1717
02:00:14,252 --> 02:00:15,219
Megatron!

1718
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16,487
Prime.

1719
02:00:42,447 --> 02:00:44,506
Humans don't deserve to live.

1720
02:00:44,615 --> 02:00:47,277
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1721
02:00:47,719 --> 02:00:50,085
Then you will die with them!

1722
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:58,160
Join them in extinction!

1723
02:01:17,382 --> 02:01:19,043
Keep moving, Sam!

1724
02:01:20,051 --> 02:01:21,416
Don't stop!

1725
02:01:37,435 --> 02:01:38,424
No!

1726
02:01:53,651 --> 02:01:55,744
Sam, get to the building!

1727
02:02:03,661 --> 02:02:05,788
Give me that Cube, boy!

1728
02:02:18,443 --> 02:02:20,536
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1729
02:02:41,899 --> 02:02:45,357
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1730
02:02:50,675 --> 02:02:53,803
I smell you, boy!

1731
02:03:06,023 --> 02:03:07,183
Maggot!

1732
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:27,802
Oh, no!

1733
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:54,201
I'll drive! You shoot!

1734
02:04:15,159 --> 02:04:16,456
This isn't going well!

1735
02:04:16,561 --> 02:04:17,960
Shoot! Shoot!

1736
02:05:03,808 --> 02:05:05,036
Nice shot.

1737
02:05:05,142 --> 02:05:08,600
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

1738
02:05:19,090 --> 02:05:20,148
Hey!

1739
02:05:23,628 --> 02:05:27,064
Hey! I'm over here!

1740
02:05:39,410 --> 02:05:41,105
We've got the boy.

1741
02:05:45,716 --> 02:05:47,149
Watch out!

1742
02:05:47,518 --> 02:05:48,712
Missile!

1743
02:05:59,196 --> 02:06:00,629
Hang on, Sam!

1744
02:06:09,373 --> 02:06:10,704
No! No!

1745
02:06:16,414 --> 02:06:21,442
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1746
02:06:34,999 --> 02:06:36,466
Where do I go?

1747
02:06:37,802 --> 02:06:41,761
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1748
02:06:43,074 --> 02:06:44,701
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1749
02:06:48,879 --> 02:06:51,313
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1750
02:06:51,449 --> 02:06:54,247
Oh, so unwise.

1751
02:07:06,197 --> 02:07:07,687
I got you, boy.

1752
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:11,297
Hold on to the Cube!

1753
02:07:30,988 --> 02:07:33,855
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

1754
02:07:38,863 --> 02:07:39,887
Sam?

1755
02:07:44,168 --> 02:07:47,399
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1756
02:07:48,139 --> 02:07:49,606
No sacrifice,

1757
02:07:50,975 --> 02:07:54,035
- no victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron,

1758
02:07:54,378 --> 02:07:56,869
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1759
02:07:57,281 --> 02:08:00,478
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1760
02:08:00,951 --> 02:08:02,418
Get behind me.

1761
02:08:04,121 --> 02:08:06,681
It's you and me, Megatron.

1762
02:08:06,791 --> 02:08:09,726
No, it's just me, Prime.

1763
02:08:12,163 --> 02:08:17,294
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1764
02:08:22,706 --> 02:08:27,541
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1765
02:08:46,697 --> 02:08:49,097
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1766
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:51,668
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1767
02:08:51,769 --> 02:08:52,793
Hey.

1768
02:08:54,004 --> 02:08:56,165
Bring the rain. All right?

1769
02:08:56,574 --> 02:08:58,565
All right, let's kill these things.

1770
02:09:00,544 --> 02:09:02,102
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

1771
02:09:02,213 --> 02:09:04,204
Armor's weak under the chest.

1772
02:09:14,291 --> 02:09:15,849
Target marked. Still waiting.

1773
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:17,985
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

1774
02:09:24,935 --> 02:09:27,028
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1775
02:09:32,276 --> 02:09:33,709
Move out!

1776
02:09:36,947 --> 02:09:38,175
Incoming!

1777
02:09:46,724 --> 02:09:48,817
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

1778
02:10:07,478 --> 02:10:09,309
Run! Move!

1779
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:18,344
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

1780
02:10:21,859 --> 02:10:23,451
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

1781
02:10:23,561 --> 02:10:26,029
<i>- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...</i>

1782
02:10:34,772 --> 02:10:36,933
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

1783
02:10:41,011 --> 02:10:43,104
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

1784
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:44,777
Take him out!

1785
02:10:58,996 --> 02:11:00,327
Two's down!

1786
02:11:09,773 --> 02:11:11,707
I'll kill you!

1787
02:11:11,809 --> 02:11:14,573
Mine! All Spark!

1788
02:11:15,546 --> 02:11:18,413
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1789
02:11:19,116 --> 02:11:20,140
Sam!

1790
02:11:21,018 --> 02:11:22,212
No, Sam!

1791
02:11:48,045 --> 02:11:49,205
Hold up.

1792
02:11:52,316 --> 02:11:55,285
You left me no choice, brother.

1793
02:12:04,895 --> 02:12:07,762
Sam, I owe you my life.

1794
02:12:08,899 --> 02:12:10,628
We are in your debt.

1795
02:12:30,154 --> 02:12:32,554
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1796
02:12:33,424 --> 02:12:34,721
Jazz.

1797
02:12:37,928 --> 02:12:40,123
We lost a great comrade

1798
02:12:41,465 --> 02:12:43,330
but gained new ones.

1799
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:45,898
Thank you, all of you.

1800
02:12:46,236 --> 02:12:48,602
You honor us with your bravery.

1801
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:51,608
Permission to speak, sir?

1802
02:12:52,109 --> 02:12:54,976
Permission granted, old friend.

1803
02:12:55,079 --> 02:12:56,546
You speak now?

1804
02:12:57,481 --> 02:12:59,574
I wish to stay with the boy.

1805
02:13:00,451 --> 02:13:02,282
If that is his choice.

1806
02:13:07,224 --> 02:13:08,248
Yes.

1807
02:13:28,912 --> 02:13:33,645
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1808
02:13:34,184 --> 02:13:37,210
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1809
02:13:37,855 --> 02:13:41,154
<i>The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,</i>

1810
02:13:41,258 --> 02:13:43,351
<i>deepest place on our planet.</i>

1811
02:13:43,594 --> 02:13:47,121
<i>The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,</i>

1812
02:13:47,231 --> 02:13:49,426
<i>would crush and entomb them,</i>

1813
02:13:51,235 --> 02:13:52,964
<i>leaving no evidence.</i>

1814
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:04,013
<i>With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

1815
02:14:05,749 --> 02:14:08,343
<i>And fate has yielded its reward,</i>

1816
02:14:09,887 --> 02:14:12,788
<i>a new world to call home.</i>

1817
02:14:19,062 --> 02:14:23,260
<i>We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,</i>

1818
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:26,164
<i>but watching over them in secret,</i>

1819
02:14:26,403 --> 02:14:28,963
<i>waiting, protecting.</i>

1820
02:14:30,374 --> 02:14:33,400
<i>I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.</i>

1821
02:14:34,011 --> 02:14:37,003
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

1822
02:14:37,114 --> 02:14:42,051
<i>like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.</i>

1823
02:14:43,587 --> 02:14:46,078
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

1824
02:14:46,490 --> 02:14:49,857
<i>and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots</i>

1825
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:52,952
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

1826
02:14:53,997 --> 02:14:55,726
<i>We are here.</i>

1827
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:58,325
<i>We are waiting.</i>

1828
02:15:17,621 --> 02:15:22,649
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1829
02:15:25,662 --> 02:15:31,157
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1830
02:15:31,768 --> 02:15:33,668
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1831
02:15:34,037 --> 02:15:36,471
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1832
02:15:36,573 --> 02:15:38,234
The government would let us know.

1833
02:15:38,408 --> 02:15:40,000
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

1834
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:42,544
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1835
02:15:42,646 --> 02:15:44,273
because there's no secrets.

1836
02:15:44,381 --> 02:15:46,474
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1837
02:15:56,526 --> 02:15:59,825
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
