1
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,485
Before time began, there was the Cube.

2
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,151
We know not where it comes from,

3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,495
only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,094
That is how our race was born.

5
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,671
For a time, we lived in harmony,

6
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:19,336
but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.

7
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,577
And so began the war,

8
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,710
a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,953
and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.

10
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,360
We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,

11
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,960
searching every star, every world.

12
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:50,443
And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us

13
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,980
to an unknown planet called Earth.

14
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,255
But we were already too late.

15
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:13,156
Qutar

16
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,795
Oh, God, five months of this.

17
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,397
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

18
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,534
A plate of mama's alligators etouffee.

19
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,805
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

20
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,076
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

21
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,482
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

22
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,644
I understand.

23
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,521
English, please. English.

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,323
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

25
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,625
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

26
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,663
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

27
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,798
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

28
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

29
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,638
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

30
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,780
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

31
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,375
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

32
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,454
Shut up!

33
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,375
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

34
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

35
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,570
Hey, hey!

36
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,878
Watch this crossover, baby.

37
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,147
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

38
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,149
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

39
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,521
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,220
- Water?
- Thank you.

41
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,895
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

42
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,371
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

43
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,606
Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.

44
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,516
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

45
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,453
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,393
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

47
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:33,037
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

48
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,267
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

49
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,577
Copy the bogie.

50
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,239
Tail 4500 X-ray.

51
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

52
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,748
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

53
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,912
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

54
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,990
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

55
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,591
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

56
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,027
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

57
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,265
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

58
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,268
- My ladies!
- Look.

59
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,373
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

60
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,606
Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.

61
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,439
Baby, we made a good-Iooking kid.

62
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,677
I know that people say that all the time,

63
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,152
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

64
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,018
She has your laugh.

65
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,717
- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.

66
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,761
You sure she didn't just fart?

67
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,659
No, she's a lady.

68
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,255
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

69
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,670
4500 X. Something's not right.

70
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,405
Bogie's on the deck.

71
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

72
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,014
It's coming from the chopper.

73
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,682
- Will?
- Sarah?

74
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,191
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

75
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,623
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

76
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,322
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

77
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,398
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

78
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,765
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

79
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,619
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

80
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,855
My God.

81
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,143
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

82
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,344
Go! Move! Move!

83
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,983
It's going after the files!

84
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,454
Cut the hard lines!

85
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
I need a key! It's locked!

86
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,022
Move! Move!

87
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,735
Here, come here! Come here!

88
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,781
Here, hide in here!

89
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,986
Oh, my God. Okay.

90
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,647
No!

91
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,428
Oh!

92
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,236
What the...

93
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,947
Epps, let's go!

94
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,403
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

95
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,140
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

96
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,437
Watch.

97
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,545
Okay.

98
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,242
For my family...

99
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,785
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

100
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,056
Okay.

101
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,183
So, for my family genealogy report,

102
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,422
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

103
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,766
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

104
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
Very famous explorer.

105
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:35,796
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

106
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:43,104
In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.

107
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,214
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

108
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,723
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

109
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,656
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

110
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,164
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

111
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,364
So that's the story, right?

112
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,665
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

113
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,603
used by 19th-century seamen.

114
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,910
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

115
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,308
It's all for sale, by the way.

116
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:18,111
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

117
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,683
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

118
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,516
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

119
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,853
Are you going to sell me his liver?

120
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,552
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

121
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,753
I don't think your grandfather would be

122
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,090
particularly proud of what you're doing.

123
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,428
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

124
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,592
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

125
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,033
Cold hard cash works, too.

126
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,435
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

127
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,870
- Sam!
- Sorry.

128
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,803
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

129
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,744
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

130
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,008
drawing these strange symbols

131
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,584
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

132
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,346
that he thought he'd discovered.

133
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,287
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

134
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,689
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

135
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,125
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

136
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,789
Okay. Pretty good, right?

137
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,134
I'd say a solid B-.

138
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,826
A B-?

139
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,963
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

140
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,234
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

141
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,570
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

142
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,009
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

143
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,670
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

144
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,409
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

145
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
And a man's promise to that boy.

146
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,218
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

147
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

148
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,818
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

149
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,987
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

150
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,891
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

151
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,633
Yes! Yes, yes.

152
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,140
So?

153
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,441
A-. It's an A, though.

154
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

155
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,105
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

156
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,110
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

157
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
Yeah, a little surprise.

158
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,081
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

159
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,547
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

160
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,594
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

161
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,959
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

162
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

163
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,297
a Porsche for your first car?

164
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

165
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,199
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

166
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,815
- Manny!
- What?

167
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,377
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

168
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,577
He's having a heat stroke again.

169
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,744
Scaring white folks.

170
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,754
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

171
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,184
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

172
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,850
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

173
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,326
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

174
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,897
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

175
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,329
- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,527
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

177
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,399
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

178
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

179
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,069
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

180
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,233
Gentlemen.

181
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,110
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

182
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,306
How can I help you?

183
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,179
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

184
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,179
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

185
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,657
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

186
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,125
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

187
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,090
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

188
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

189
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,232
The car'll pick the driver.

190
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,137
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

191
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,143
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

192
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,773
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

193
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,544
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

194
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,714
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

195
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:52,353
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

196
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,897
This ain't bad.

197
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,226
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

198
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,667
It got racing...

199
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,170
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

200
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,036
I don't know nothing about this car.

201
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,370
- Manny!
- What?

202
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,070
What is this? This car! Check it out!

203
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,670
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!

204
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,273
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

205
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,908
Feels good.

206
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,483
- How much?
- Well,

207
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,453
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

208
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,359
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

209
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,525
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

210
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
It's custom faded?

211
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,533
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

212
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,437
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

213
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,434
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

214
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

215
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,409
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

216
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,678
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

217
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,912
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

218
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,615
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

219
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,749
This is a classic engine right here.

220
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,191
I sold a car the other day...

221
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,663
Gee. Holy cow.

222
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,198
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

223
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,066
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

224
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,831
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

225
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,066
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

226
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,109
...greater than man...

227
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,304
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

228
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,530
$4,000.

229
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,531
washington

230
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,336
Steve.

231
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,345
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

232
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,941
They're so young.

233
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,178
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

234
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,550
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

235
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,022
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

236
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,123
I am so underdressed.

237
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

238
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,761
Please be seated.

239
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,798
I'm John Keller.

240
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,170
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

241
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,443
At 1900 local time yesterday,

242
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,742
the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.

243
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,213
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

244
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,918
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

245
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,149
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

246
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,693
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

247
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,662
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

248
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

249
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,161
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

250
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

251
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,010
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

252
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,587
and intercept further communications,

253
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,486
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

254
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,789
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

255
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,492
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

256
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,192
The President has dispatched
battle groups

257
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,464
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

258
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,198
Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.

259
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,207
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

260
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,833
Good luck to us all.

261
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,723
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

262
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,422
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

263
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,654
Zero bids.

264
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,430
Great. Broke.

265
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,901
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

266
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,203
No. Premature.

267
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,638
Good. What's up?

268
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,575
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

269
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
It's like clockwork.

270
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,774
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

271
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,943
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

272
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,351
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

273
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,552
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

274
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,854
This one is wobbly.

275
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,057
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

276
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,291
- Sam...
- What?

277
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
I do not like footprints on my grass.

278
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,264
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

279
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,066
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

280
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,300
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

281
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,502
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

282
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,704
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

283
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,974
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

284
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,640
That's his bling.

285
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,951
I want you home at 11:00!

286
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,918
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

287
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,148
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

288
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,485
Seat belt on!

289
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,458
Wow. You are so cheap.

290
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,569
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

291
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:10,973
At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

292
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,484
Oh, my God.

293
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,

294
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,647
our highest readiness level.

295
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,685
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

296
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,157
that we have not come across before.

297
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,296
But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...

298
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,226
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

299
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,059
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

300
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,032
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

301
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,233
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

302
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,639
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

303
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,906
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

304
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,311
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

305
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,574
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

306
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,653
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

307
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,717
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

308
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

309
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,019
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

310
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,496
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

311
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,464
It looked right at me.

312
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

313
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,007
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

314
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,439
My radio's fried.

315
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,538
- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.

316
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,615
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

317
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

318
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,012
All right, let's hit it.

319
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,788
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

320
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,760
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

321
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh, my God.

322
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,329
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

323
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,994
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

324
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,071
Okay.

325
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,740
Hey, guys, check it out.

326
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,213
Oh, hi.

327
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,409
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

328
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,615
So, what are you guys doing here?

329
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,225
We're here to climb this tree.

330
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

331
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,397
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

332
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,467
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

333
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,333
Let's go call your mom.

334
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,339
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

335
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,137
I was researching a book I was writing.

336
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,541
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

337
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

338
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,145
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

339
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,483
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

340
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,752
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

341
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,419
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

342
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,222
That's funny.

343
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,024
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

344
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,099
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

345
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,263
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

346
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,967
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

347
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
What are you doing?

348
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,270
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

349
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,814
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

350
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,181
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

351
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,255
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

352
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,348
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

353
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,694
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

354
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,299
Okay.

355
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,200
You'll call me.

356
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,509
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

357
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,101
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

358
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,113
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

359
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,843
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

360
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,578
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

361
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,948
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

362
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,453
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

363
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,183
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

364
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,088
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

365
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,524
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

366
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
Bros before hos.

367
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,692
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

368
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,786
You can't do this to me.

369
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,991
You got to get out of my car right now.

370
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,274
Who's gonna come around
when you break?

371
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,242
Mikaela! It's Sam.

372
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,368
Witwicky.

373
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,040
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

374
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,115
You sure?

375
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,979
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

376
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,542
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

377
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,783
There you go.

378
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,897
So...

379
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,168
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

380
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,234
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

381
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,367
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

382
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,710
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

383
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,808
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

384
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,446
for tight abs and really big arms.

385
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,117
Big arms?

386
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,857
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

387
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,453
Like, I just put in that light there.

388
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,991
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

389
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,872
Yeah.

390
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,510
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

391
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,443
Oh, no, no.

392
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

393
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

394
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,582
Yeah, a long time.

395
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,586
Well, do we have any classes together?

396
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,246
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?

397
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,848
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

398
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,222
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

399
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,764
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

400
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,526
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

401
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,328
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

402
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,869
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

403
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,870
No, no, no. No. Come on.

404
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,677
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

405
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,240
When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing

406
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,079
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

407
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,880
Sexual healing

408
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,217
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

409
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,292
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

410
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,792
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

411
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,590
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

412
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,028
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

413
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,463
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

414
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,627
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

415
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,231
I feel good

416
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,738
Just pop the hood.

417
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,370
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

418
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,041
Whoa, nice headers.

419
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,705
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

420
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,216
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

421
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,546
Double-pump?

422
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,349
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

423
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,119
I like to go faster.

424
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:32,160
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

425
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,093
Yeah? How'd you know that?

426
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:40,227
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

427
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,774
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

428
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,070
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

429
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,166
Oh, my God.

430
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,837
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

431
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,973
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

432
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,711
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

433
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,686
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

434
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,347
I prefer it, actually.

435
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,323
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

436
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,622
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.

437
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,165
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

438
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,028
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

439
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,799
Good luck with your car.

440
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,266
All right.

441
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,310
Walking's healthy, right?

442
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,674
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

443
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,346
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

444
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,284
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

445
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,855
Baby come back
any kind of fool could see

446
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,219
Hey!

447
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,256
There was something
in everything about you

448
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,458
Baby come back
you can blame it all on me

449
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,900
Hey!

450
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,167
Wait a second!

451
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,800
I was wrong
and I just can't live without you

452
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,971
There it is.

453
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,450
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

454
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,184
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

455
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,485
I think you're... No, no, no.

456
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,195
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

457
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,135
Okay.

458
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,104
Yeah.

459
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,730
All right, I'll see you at school.

460
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,899
All right.

461
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,281
That's stupid.

462
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,640
That was a stupid line.

463
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,549
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

464
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,321
Oh, God.

465
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,317
Oh, my God. I love my car.

466
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:49,018
national

467
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:58,867
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

468
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,640
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

469
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,513
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

470
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,213
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

471
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,722
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

472
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,885
We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,

473
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,190
we'll know just what to do with them.

474
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,893
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

475
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,309
Apparently, there are
very few survivors.

476
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,612
Yes, Mr. President?

477
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,655
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

478
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,862
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

479
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,198
Shoot.

480
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,903
Gross.

481
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,769
Do you hear that?

482
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,304
Are you getting this?

483
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,942
I think they're hacking
the network again.

484
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,143
detected

485
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:28,144
found

486
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,293
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

487
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,233
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

488
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,328
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.

489
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:51,329
virus

490
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,330
uploading

491
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,748
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

492
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,377
We need a senior analyst.

493
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,352
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

494
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,981
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

495
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,289
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

496
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,919
Code Red. We have a breach.

497
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,760
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

498
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,631
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

499
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,640
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

500
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,870
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

501
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,675
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

502
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,774
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

503
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,204
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

504
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,776
What the...

505
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,650
Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.

506
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,586
Crew, prepare for emergency descent.

507
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,665
I want our President in that bunker.

508
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,803
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

509
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,007
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

510
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,242
Air Force One is on the ground.

511
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,977
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

512
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,376
That's my car!

513
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,152
No!

514
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,383
No, no, no, no.

515
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,026
Dad, call the cops!

516
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,932
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

517
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,772
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

518
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,336
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

519
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,246
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

520
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,013
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

521
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,211
Oh, my God.

522
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,036
My name is Sam Witwicky.

523
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,075
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

524
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,906
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

525
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,378
and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.

526
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,473
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

527
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,212
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

528
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,288
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

529
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,094
No! No! No! No!

530
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,004
Oh, my God.

531
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,099
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

532
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,402
Oh, my God.

533
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:55,414
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

534
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,687
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

535
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,123
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

536
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,363
Listen, listen, listen.

537
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,796
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

538
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,458
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

539
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,628
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

540
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,302
Put your head on the hood.

541
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,318
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

542
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,949
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

543
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,687
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

544
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,923
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

545
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,660
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

546
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,759
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

547
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,395
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

548
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,564
It's become the system.

549
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,837
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

550
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,536
The only countries
with this kind of capability

551
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,943
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

552
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,983
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

553
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,314
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

554
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,251
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

555
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,483
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

556
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,622
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

557
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,356
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

558
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,126
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

559
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,963
would take 20 years to do that.

560
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,537
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

561
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,970
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

562
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,566
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

563
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,044
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

564
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,411
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

565
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,711
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

566
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,151
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

567
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,746
What about an organism?
A living organism?

568
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,257
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

569
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,023
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

570
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,057
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

571
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,498
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

572
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,093
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

573
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,141
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

574
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,050
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

575
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,318
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

576
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,551
Wow. That's really neat.

577
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,786
Okay, chiefie.

578
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,957
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

579
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,862
What are you rolling?

580
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

581
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,767
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

582
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,368
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

583
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,235
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

584
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,973
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

585
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,213
What was that?

586
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,051
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

587
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,683
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

588
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,993
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

589
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,629
Are you on drugs?

590
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,440
Let's hope this telephone line works.

591
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,449
Hey, heads up!

592
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,180
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

593
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
What the heck was that?

594
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,098
English, dude. English.

595
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,634
Whoa!

596
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,800
Watch out!

597
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,552
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!

598
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,711
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

599
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,948
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

600
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,462
Get up! Get up! Come on!

601
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,371
Go! Move it!

602
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,782
Take cover!

603
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,151
Fig! Cover the rear!

604
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:36,699
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

605
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,827
Come on! Give me a mag!

606
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,663
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

607
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,865
Papa!

608
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,738
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

609
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,210
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!

610
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,905
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

611
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,277
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

612
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,350
Fire!

613
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,145
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

614
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,745
It's an emergency Pentagon...

615
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,752
I don't have a credit card!

616
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,959
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

617
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,761
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

618
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:15,168
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

619
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,804
Ammo!

620
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,537
I need a credit card!

621
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,277
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

622
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,646
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

623
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:32,950
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

624
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,952
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

625
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,051
Okay, it's Visa.

626
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,557
Also, sir, have you heard about

627
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,756
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

628
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:46,997
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

629
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,269
Give me a status.

630
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,236
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

631
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,040
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

632
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,113
Survivors?

633
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,612
I ain't never seen this in my life!

634
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,449
Need gunships on station ASAP!

635
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,749
Predator's coming up in a minute.

636
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,255
We're linking the call
to the nearest AWACS.

637
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,500
Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...

638
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,462
Predator ETA two minutes.

639
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,179
Hey! Make way!

640
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,111
- What is that?
- I don't know.

641
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,088
We need air support
and we need it now.

642
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,288
Roll in strike package Bravo
on unknown target.

643
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,993
I authenticate Tango Whiskey
at time 0300 Zulu.

644
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,934
Attention, all aircraft. This will be
a danger close-fire mission.

645
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,562
Weapons, I just got a call
from Falcon Ops.

646
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,368
Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?

647
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:58,998
- Send the Hogs, sir.
- Okay, send the Hogs over

648
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,804
to Kill Box One Alpha.
It's a danger close...

649
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,436
Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha,
300 feet danger close.

650
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,447
Friendlies in the area.

651
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,575
Seven-man team
north of orange smoke!

652
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,917
Received Kill Box One Alpha.
Engage hostile.

653
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,556
Attack direction west!
You're clear and hot!

654
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,129
Strike, tell me status of Hog right now.

655
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,097
Hog One-One Dark Star status.

656
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,564
- Lennox! The heat's coming!
- Laze the target!

657
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,233
We got a beam-rider incoming!
Laze target!

658
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,211
- Ready! Heat's coming!
- What? Bring it!

659
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,913
Receiving radar jamming
in vicinity of target.

660
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,068
No frigging way
that thing's still not down.

661
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:06,438
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells.
Bring the rain.

662
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,082
Be advised, ground team is requesting
105 sabot rounds.

663
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,402
Did we lose them?

664
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,072
Warthog One confirm visual
on friendlies.

665
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,311
Where's Fig?

666
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,846
- Fig? Fig?
- Oh, God!

667
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,620
- God damn it!
- Get a medic!

668
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,817
Get a medic!

669
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,017
- I'm sorry.
- Black Hawk...

670
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,321
We'll get a medic. Just hold on.
He's got a pulse.

671
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,294
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.

672
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,731
Bring them home.

673
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,505
You get those men stateside right now.

674
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,704
I want them debriefed in 10 hours.

675
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,852
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

676
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,994
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

677
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,799
I am sorry to bother you.

678
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,733
- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.

679
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,834
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

680
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,606
- Listen to me.
- Glen! Who is it?

681
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,840
Shut up, Grandma!

682
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,383
- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?

683
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,578
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

684
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,083
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.

685
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,592
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

686
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,036
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?

687
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,971
Yeah. Get low.

688
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:22,244
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

689
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,177
Hey. I need a moment.

690
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,513
- Please.
- Sorry.

691
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,676
Hey, man, save my game.

692
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,651
How classified?

693
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,050
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

694
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,294
Yes! One quick peek.

695
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:42,259
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

696
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,891
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

697
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,560
The rangers are en route
with the imager,

698
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,570
but we also have a security issue.

699
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,936
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

700
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,702
of the network intrusion signal.

701
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:59,011
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

702
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,448
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

703
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,110
in less than a minute.

704
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,415
- No way.
- Yeah.

705
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:11,327
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

706
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,025
"Project Iceman"?

707
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,537
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

708
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,406
Are you playing
those video games again?

709
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,601
Cops! Cops!

710
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,408
FBI! Clear right!

711
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,344
Lock it down! Lock it down!

712
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,021
Cops!

713
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,448
Lock it down.

714
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,048
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

715
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,722
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

716
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,458
Especially police!

717
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,831
It was an awesome spectacle here
an hour ago

718
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,804
when over 40 C-17 s lifted off
of this very base.

719
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,466
We're not told where they're going.

720
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:00,565
Morning, Mo.

721
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,975
The government has been very quiet
about what's going on but in our...

722
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,707
- Mojo. Mojo.
- They were headed directly

723
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,339
towards North Korea.

724
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,317
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

725
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,686
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

726
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,817
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?

727
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,829
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

728
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,729
Stop!

729
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,569
No, no, no, no, no, no.

730
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,207
Oh, my God!

731
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,017
Sam?

732
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,088
Hi.

733
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,654
That was... That was really awesome.

734
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,852
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?

735
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,952
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

736
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,928
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

737
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,262
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

738
00:49:30,405 --> 00:49:31,963
Oh, great. Cops.

739
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:38,272
Officer!

740
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:41,677
Listen!

741
00:49:43,218 --> 00:49:44,185
Oh, that hurt.

742
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:48,411
Listen to me!

743
00:49:48,523 --> 00:49:51,390
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

744
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:55,155
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

745
00:49:55,263 --> 00:49:57,857
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

746
00:49:57,966 --> 00:50:04,428
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

747
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:09,232
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

748
00:50:10,545 --> 00:50:14,413
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

749
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:21,350
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?

750
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,090
Okay.

751
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:32,099
Oh, God, no! No!

752
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:39,473
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

753
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,273
It's a bad dream.

754
00:50:46,147 --> 00:50:47,910
Are you username LadiesMan217?

755
00:50:48,016 --> 00:50:49,176
I don't know what you're talking about!

756
00:50:49,284 --> 00:50:51,650
Are you username LadiesMan217?

757
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:52,879
Yeah.

758
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:55,421
Where is eBay item 21153?

759
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:57,218
Where are the glasses?

760
00:51:08,803 --> 00:51:10,065
Get back!

761
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:11,939
Stop!

762
00:51:15,076 --> 00:51:16,043
God!

763
00:51:16,944 --> 00:51:18,707
What is your problem, Sam?

764
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:20,804
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

765
00:51:20,915 --> 00:51:22,459
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

765
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:25,352
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

766
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:34,051
Sam, what is that thing?

767
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:35,527
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

768
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,723
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

769
00:51:37,832 --> 00:51:42,201
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

770
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:55,146
Go, go, go, go!

771
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:01,551
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

772
00:52:01,656 --> 00:52:03,214
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

773
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:05,622
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

774
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,659
Oh, my God! No!

775
00:52:07,762 --> 00:52:09,059
We're gonna die!

776
00:52:15,103 --> 00:52:16,468
Oh, my God!

777
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,014
We're locked in.

778
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:40,961
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

779
00:52:46,868 --> 00:52:47,960
Okay.

780
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,003
Time to start.

781
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:56,666
He's got me! Oh, God!

782
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:05,076
He's going to kill me!

783
00:54:08,216 --> 00:54:09,877
No. No, no, no!

784
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:25,659
Get off!

785
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:41,338
Kill it! Kill it!

786
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:43,007
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

787
00:54:49,857 --> 00:54:51,825
Not so tough without a head, are you?

788
00:54:57,798 --> 00:54:59,231
Here, come on.

789
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:15,548
What is it?

790
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:18,384
It's a robot.

791
00:55:19,787 --> 00:55:21,084
But like a...

792
00:55:21,222 --> 00:55:24,714
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

793
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:27,526
It's probably Japanese.

794
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:30,028
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

795
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,327
What are you doing?

796
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:37,131
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

797
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:39,536
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

798
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,041
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

799
00:55:44,412 --> 00:55:47,575
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

800
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:50,173
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

801
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:53,816
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

802
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:56,483
- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...

803
00:55:56,591 --> 00:56:00,152
Digital cable brings you...
...Columbia Broadcasting System...

804
00:56:00,261 --> 00:56:02,024
So you... You talk through the radio?

805
00:56:02,129 --> 00:56:05,030
Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.

806
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:07,123
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

807
00:56:07,234 --> 00:56:08,701
Message from Starfleet, Captain...

808
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:10,862
Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...

809
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:12,940
Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!

810
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,167
Visitors from heaven? What...

811
00:56:15,276 --> 00:56:17,403
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

812
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:25,708
Any more questions you want to ask?

813
00:56:26,387 --> 00:56:28,548
He wants us to get in the car.

814
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,057
And go where?

815
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,822
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

816
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:37,021
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

817
00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:08,223
This car's a pretty good driver.

818
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:09,489
I know.

819
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,134
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

820
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:16,429
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

821
00:57:16,537 --> 00:57:17,595
Yeah.

822
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,507
You're right.

823
00:57:22,043 --> 00:57:25,012
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

824
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,946
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

825
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,418
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

826
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:35,079
- Yeah.
- Okay.

827
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:39,549
There, see? That's better.

828
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,259
- Okay.
- Okay.

829
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:48,332
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

830
00:57:49,403 --> 00:57:50,370
Thank you.

831
00:57:51,439 --> 00:57:53,566
You know what I don't understand?

832
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:56,734
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

833
00:57:56,844 --> 00:57:59,438
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

834
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:02,178
Whoa! Whoa!

835
00:58:02,283 --> 00:58:05,047
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

836
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:06,210
Move it, you moron!

837
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,345
Great, now... See?

838
00:58:09,757 --> 00:58:10,883
Fantastic.

839
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,856
Now you pissed him off.

840
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,627
That car is sensitive.

841
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:16,924
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

842
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:31,169
What?

843
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:36,307
This is you...

844
00:59:41,448 --> 00:59:43,348
Oh, my God!

845
00:59:50,591 --> 00:59:52,286
Come on, let's go.

846
00:59:57,198 --> 01:00:00,395
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

847
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:03,959
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!

848
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:06,299
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

849
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:21,914
Whoa! Sweet!

850
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:24,149
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

851
01:00:24,258 --> 01:00:25,520
'cause he is so boned!

852
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,761
What is that?

853
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:32,890
There's something in the tree, dude.

854
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,127
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

855
01:00:35,236 --> 01:00:36,567
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

856
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:14,463
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

857
01:01:15,743 --> 01:01:19,076
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

858
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:21,670
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

859
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:58,406
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

860
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,048
They know your name.

861
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:01,343
They know your name.

862
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:03,249
Yeah.

863
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,784
My name is Optimus Prime.

864
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:09,947
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

865
01:03:10,057 --> 01:03:13,424
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

866
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:18,894
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

867
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:22,526
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

868
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:24,968
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

869
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:28,667
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

870
01:03:30,177 --> 01:03:32,645
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

871
01:03:33,547 --> 01:03:37,108
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

872
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:40,448
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

873
01:03:41,688 --> 01:03:43,849
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

874
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:48,087
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

875
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:53,830
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

876
01:03:54,068 --> 01:03:55,729
Bumblebee, right?

877
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:57,531
Check on the rep
Yep, second to none

878
01:03:57,638 --> 01:04:00,004
So you're my guardian, huh?

879
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:05,306
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

880
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,515
Why are you here?

881
01:04:11,618 --> 01:04:16,851
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

882
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:18,624
Mega-what?

883
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:33,799
Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,

884
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:39,710
until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

885
01:04:40,814 --> 01:04:44,079
All who defied them were destroyed.

886
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:50,282
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.

887
01:04:51,258 --> 01:04:57,254
Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.

888
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:00,127
My grandfather.

889
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:04,432
It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.

890
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:09,199
Come back!

891
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:14,305
I think the dogs have found something.

892
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:17,145
The ice is cracking!

893
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,553
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

894
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:32,288
I'm all right, lads!

895
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:36,095
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

896
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:48,574
Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.

897
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:55,610
Men! We've made a discovery!

898
01:05:55,722 --> 01:06:00,125
He accidentally activated
his navigation system.

899
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:19,543
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

900
01:06:19,646 --> 01:06:21,671
How'd you know about his glasses?

901
01:06:21,782 --> 01:06:24,012
- EBay.
- EBay.

902
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:27,280
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

903
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:33,223
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

904
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:36,728
And the human race
will be extinguished.

905
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:42,291
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

906
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:48,474
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

907
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:55,848
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

908
01:06:55,949 --> 01:06:57,940
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

909
01:06:58,051 --> 01:06:59,313
Melted right through.

910
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:02,616
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

911
01:07:02,756 --> 01:07:04,951
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

912
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:07,253
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

913
01:07:07,628 --> 01:07:09,653
- Heads up!
- Oh!

914
01:07:10,397 --> 01:07:13,059
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

915
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:17,198
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

916
01:07:17,304 --> 01:07:18,635
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

917
01:07:18,739 --> 01:07:21,003
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

918
01:07:21,108 --> 01:07:22,575
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

919
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,505
You want that piece?

920
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,911
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

921
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:35,075
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

922
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:38,517
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

923
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,181
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

924
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,758
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

925
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:47,694
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

926
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:48,957
It's me and you.

927
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,898
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

928
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,974
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

929
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,712
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

930
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,811
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

931
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:13,889
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

932
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,220
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

933
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:21,024
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

934
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,097
Okay, so what?

935
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,291
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

936
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,095
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

937
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,169
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

938
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:31,104
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

939
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,502
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

940
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,203
See? So can I go home now?

941
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,543
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

942
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:43,346
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

943
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,785
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

944
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,483
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

945
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:51,321
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

946
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,725
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

947
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,663
Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...

948
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:58,358
- What did he say?
- What?

949
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,935
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

950
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:02,596
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

951
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,104
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

952
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,310
Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...

953
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,608
- Yeah!
- Call Sam.

954
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,273
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

955
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:15,680
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

956
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:18,310
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

957
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:20,048
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

958
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,761
I need you to stay here, all right?

959
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,023
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

960
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:29,098
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

961
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,187
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

962
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,266
Five minutes, all right?

963
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:34,937
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

964
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,005
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

965
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,733
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

966
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,139
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

967
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:44,907
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

968
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,572
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

969
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,549
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

970
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,212
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

971
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:53,413
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

972
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:54,990
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

973
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:56,558
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

974
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,024
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

975
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,355
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

976
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,362
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

977
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:05,332
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

978
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,800
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

979
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:08,871
The...

980
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,308
I love you. God, I love you

981
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,138
just so much right now.

982
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,677
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

983
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,303
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

984
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,245
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

985
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,714
because you're such a swell guy.

986
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:22,944
One more thing, huh?

987
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,112
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

988
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,316
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

989
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:31,722
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

990
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:34,695
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

991
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,231
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

992
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,301
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

993
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,235
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

994
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:47,499
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

995
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:51,603
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

996
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,281
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

997
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:58,410
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

998
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:01,285
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

999
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,188
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

1000
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:07,262
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

1001
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:08,557
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

1002
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:10,825
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

1003
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:14,130
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

1004
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:16,933
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

1005
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:22,605
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

1006
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,202
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

1007
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:25,871
That's all it is.

1008
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,780
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1009
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,184
Okay, okay.

1010
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:35,016
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1011
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,785
Autobots, recon.

1012
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:44,325
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1013
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,196
Got some ice on his nose.

1014
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,736
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1015
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:50,203
You did not.

1016
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,601
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

1017
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,903
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1018
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,608
Come on, come on.

1019
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:08,515
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1020
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:11,218
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1021
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,988
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1022
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,086
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1023
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,456
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

1024
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:19,591
My glasses were in the bag.

1025
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:21,533
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1026
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:23,195
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1027
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:24,364
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1028
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,668
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1029
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:29,711
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1030
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:32,246
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1031
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,781
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1032
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:34,850
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

1033
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:36,316
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1034
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:39,115
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1035
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,155
I'm already stressed out enough.

1036
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:42,747
Okay. What now?

1037
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:48,597
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1038
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:52,657
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1039
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:53,757
Oh, God. Oh!

1040
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:57,999
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.

1041
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,405
My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?

1042
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,606
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1043
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:06,648
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1044
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:08,341
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1045
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:09,509
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1046
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:10,846
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1047
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,944
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1048
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,522
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1049
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,181
We must have the glasses.

1050
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:17,850
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1051
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,190
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1052
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:21,388
Keep searching.

1053
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,158
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1054
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:24,493
Ten minutes. Okay?

1055
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,363
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1056
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:28,460
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1057
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,595
Calm down, calm down.

1058
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,400
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1059
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,169
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1060
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,141
Good? Good? Okay.

1061
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,405
- Move!
- Get away!

1062
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,208
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1063
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:41,215
He wants us to be quiet.

1064
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:48,854
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1065
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:49,658
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1066
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,821
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1067
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,759
How did you get over there so fast?

1068
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,594
Wow! That was tingly!

1069
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:01,101
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

1070
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:07,966
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1071
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:13,075
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1072
01:14:13,471 --> 01:14:15,200
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1073
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,035
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

1074
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:19,701
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1075
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:20,869
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1076
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:22,879
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1077
01:14:22,981 --> 01:14:24,141
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

1078
01:14:24,248 --> 01:14:25,306
How come the door's locked?

1079
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:29,045
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1080
01:14:29,153 --> 01:14:30,347
You know he'll start counting

1081
01:14:30,455 --> 01:14:31,854
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1082
01:14:31,956 --> 01:14:32,945
Oh, dear.

1083
01:14:33,057 --> 01:14:34,786
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

1084
01:14:34,926 --> 01:14:36,291
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

1085
01:14:36,394 --> 01:14:37,361
- Oh, my.
- Two.

1086
01:14:37,462 --> 01:14:39,521
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1087
01:14:40,031 --> 01:14:43,694
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1088
01:14:43,801 --> 01:14:46,793
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1089
01:14:46,904 --> 01:14:48,496
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1090
01:14:48,606 --> 01:14:50,836
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1091
01:14:50,942 --> 01:14:52,807
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1092
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,707
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1093
01:14:54,812 --> 01:14:56,302
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1094
01:14:56,414 --> 01:14:57,676
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1095
01:14:57,782 --> 01:14:59,807
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1096
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,282
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1097
01:15:01,419 --> 01:15:02,408
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1098
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,885
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1099
01:15:03,988 --> 01:15:05,455
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

1100
01:15:05,556 --> 01:15:06,989
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1101
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:09,457
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1102
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:14,020
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1103
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,958
- Judy.
- Was I...

1104
01:15:17,068 --> 01:15:18,035
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

1105
01:15:18,136 --> 01:15:19,467
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

1106
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:20,594
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1107
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:22,229
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

1108
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,173
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1109
01:15:25,276 --> 01:15:28,905
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1110
01:15:29,013 --> 01:15:31,004
- Happy time?
...my special alone time...

1111
01:15:31,115 --> 01:15:32,082
- Stop.
- Mom.

1112
01:15:32,183 --> 01:15:33,172
- Judy, stop.
...with myself.

1113
01:15:33,284 --> 01:15:34,308
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

1114
01:15:34,419 --> 01:15:36,717
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1115
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:38,846
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1116
01:15:38,956 --> 01:15:40,719
Oh, parents.

1117
01:15:41,626 --> 01:15:44,424
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1118
01:15:45,563 --> 01:15:49,124
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1119
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:51,502
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1120
01:15:51,502 --> 01:15:51,866
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1121
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:52,958
Oh, I hate these.

1122
01:15:53,071 --> 01:15:54,333
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

1123
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:55,463
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

1124
01:15:55,573 --> 01:15:57,097
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

1125
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:58,539
Can't you take safety seriously?

1126
01:15:58,643 --> 01:16:01,908
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1127
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:04,914
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1128
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:13,513
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1129
01:16:13,624 --> 01:16:16,115
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1130
01:16:16,227 --> 01:16:18,457
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1131
01:16:18,563 --> 01:16:20,258
Trashed. Gone.

1132
01:16:20,565 --> 01:16:22,032
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1133
01:16:22,133 --> 01:16:24,158
The parents are very irritating.

1134
01:16:24,268 --> 01:16:25,963
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

1135
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:28,800
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1136
01:16:28,906 --> 01:16:30,100
What is with you?

1137
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:33,541
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1138
01:16:33,644 --> 01:16:35,305
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

1139
01:16:35,413 --> 01:16:37,813
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

1140
01:16:37,915 --> 01:16:39,712
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1141
01:16:40,485 --> 01:16:42,749
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1142
01:16:44,222 --> 01:16:46,952
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1143
01:16:47,058 --> 01:16:49,925
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

1144
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:53,087
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1145
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:54,687
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1146
01:16:54,799 --> 01:16:55,959
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1147
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:16,650
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1148
01:17:16,754 --> 01:17:18,745
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1149
01:17:18,856 --> 01:17:19,823
I want you to distract my parents

1150
01:17:19,924 --> 01:17:22,222
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

1151
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:30,726
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1152
01:17:30,835 --> 01:17:32,860
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1153
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,097
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1154
01:17:35,206 --> 01:17:37,731
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1155
01:17:37,842 --> 01:17:38,968
It's Witwicky.

1156
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:42,307
May I enter the premises, sir?

1157
01:17:42,413 --> 01:17:45,348
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1158
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:46,416
What the heck is going on here?

1159
01:17:46,517 --> 01:17:48,644
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1160
01:17:48,753 --> 01:17:51,017
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1161
01:17:51,122 --> 01:17:52,555
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1162
01:17:52,657 --> 01:17:53,715
That's right. National security.

1163
01:17:53,825 --> 01:17:55,417
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1164
01:17:55,526 --> 01:17:57,892
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1165
01:17:57,995 --> 01:17:59,792
Could you stay off the grass?

1166
01:17:59,897 --> 01:18:01,330
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1167
01:18:01,432 --> 01:18:03,059
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1168
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:06,398
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1169
01:18:06,504 --> 01:18:07,971
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1170
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:09,403
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1171
01:18:09,507 --> 01:18:10,838
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1172
01:18:10,942 --> 01:18:13,103
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1173
01:18:13,211 --> 01:18:16,237
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1174
01:18:16,347 --> 01:18:18,406
- No!
- What is this?

1175
01:18:18,516 --> 01:18:21,246
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

1176
01:18:21,352 --> 01:18:22,819
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

1177
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,148
Whoa, way out of line.

1178
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,282
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1179
01:18:28,392 --> 01:18:30,292
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1180
01:18:30,394 --> 01:18:31,452
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1181
01:18:31,562 --> 01:18:32,756
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1182
01:18:32,864 --> 01:18:35,059
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1183
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:37,862
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

1184
01:18:37,969 --> 01:18:41,928
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1185
01:18:42,039 --> 01:18:44,269
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1186
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:46,935
I think direct contact.

1187
01:18:52,383 --> 01:18:53,941
- Son?
- Yeah.

1188
01:18:55,019 --> 01:18:57,920
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

1189
01:19:03,694 --> 01:19:05,161
Fourteen rads.

1190
01:19:06,764 --> 01:19:08,231
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1191
01:19:08,966 --> 01:19:10,866
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1192
01:19:10,968 --> 01:19:12,663
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1193
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,294
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1194
01:19:14,405 --> 01:19:16,270
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1195
01:19:20,544 --> 01:19:21,704
So,

1196
01:19:23,147 --> 01:19:26,605
LadiesMan217.

1197
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:30,153
That is your eBay username, right?

1198
01:19:30,254 --> 01:19:32,586
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1199
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:33,657
What do you make of this?

1200
01:19:33,758 --> 01:19:36,318
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...

1201
01:19:36,427 --> 01:19:37,553
Is that you?

1202
01:19:37,662 --> 01:19:39,857
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1203
01:19:39,964 --> 01:19:44,799
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1204
01:19:46,137 --> 01:19:48,469
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

1205
01:19:48,572 --> 01:19:53,032
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1206
01:19:53,144 --> 01:19:55,271
- Really?
...from me, from my home,

1207
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:58,348
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1208
01:19:58,449 --> 01:20:00,178
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1209
01:20:00,284 --> 01:20:03,720
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1210
01:20:06,857 --> 01:20:08,449
That's funny. That is so funny.

1211
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:11,050
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1212
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:14,993
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T? No.

1213
01:20:15,099 --> 01:20:16,589
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1214
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:17,827
You see this?

1215
01:20:17,935 --> 01:20:20,529
This is an l-can-do-whatever-l-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1216
01:20:20,638 --> 01:20:23,402
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1217
01:20:23,507 --> 01:20:24,735
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1218
01:20:24,842 --> 01:20:27,242
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1219
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:30,405
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1220
01:20:30,514 --> 01:20:32,607
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1221
01:20:32,717 --> 01:20:34,116
What? Parole?

1222
01:20:34,218 --> 01:20:37,551
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1223
01:20:37,655 --> 01:20:39,646
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1224
01:20:39,757 --> 01:20:41,486
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1225
01:20:41,592 --> 01:20:42,684
You stole cars?

1226
01:20:42,793 --> 01:20:44,488
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1227
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:46,392
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1228
01:20:46,497 --> 01:20:48,795
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1229
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:51,527
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1230
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:57,300
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1231
01:20:57,408 --> 01:20:59,706
It is time to talk!

1232
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,883
Big! It's big!

1233
01:21:12,623 --> 01:21:14,591
Go, go, go, go!

1234
01:21:15,026 --> 01:21:17,654
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1235
01:21:17,762 --> 01:21:19,195
All right! All right!

1236
01:21:33,778 --> 01:21:36,076
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1237
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:42,710
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1238
01:21:44,955 --> 01:21:48,721
Taking the children was a bad move.

1239
01:21:48,826 --> 01:21:52,227
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1240
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:57,562
Freeze!

1241
01:21:58,202 --> 01:21:59,601
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1242
01:21:59,703 --> 01:22:00,761
Whoa!

1243
01:22:02,206 --> 01:22:03,264
Whoa!

1244
01:22:14,051 --> 01:22:15,382
Hi, there.

1245
01:22:15,686 --> 01:22:20,419
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1246
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:26,062
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1247
01:22:26,664 --> 01:22:27,961
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1248
01:22:28,065 --> 01:22:30,295
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1249
01:22:30,401 --> 01:22:32,995
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1250
01:22:33,637 --> 01:22:34,763
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1251
01:22:34,872 --> 01:22:36,362
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1252
01:22:36,474 --> 01:22:39,841
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1253
01:22:39,944 --> 01:22:43,436
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1254
01:22:43,547 --> 01:22:45,071
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1255
01:22:45,182 --> 01:22:46,171
How you doing?

1256
01:22:46,283 --> 01:22:48,012
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

1257
01:22:48,119 --> 01:22:50,280
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1258
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:53,550
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

1259
01:22:53,657 --> 01:22:57,423
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1260
01:22:58,028 --> 01:23:02,192
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1261
01:23:03,767 --> 01:23:05,428
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1262
01:23:05,536 --> 01:23:08,403
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1263
01:23:08,506 --> 01:23:10,997
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

1264
01:23:11,108 --> 01:23:13,338
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1265
01:23:13,444 --> 01:23:15,435
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1266
01:23:15,546 --> 01:23:17,411
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1267
01:23:17,515 --> 01:23:19,244
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1268
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:22,183
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1269
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:25,483
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1270
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:31,728
Hey!

1271
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:34,764
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1272
01:23:34,865 --> 01:23:36,924
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1273
01:23:38,269 --> 01:23:41,568
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1274
01:23:41,672 --> 01:23:44,368
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

1275
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:47,440
For threatening my dad.

1276
01:23:50,514 --> 01:23:56,419
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1277
01:23:58,189 --> 01:23:59,850
You're a criminal.

1278
01:24:00,524 --> 01:24:03,322
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1279
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:07,628
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1280
01:24:07,731 --> 01:24:08,720
All right.

1281
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,925
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1282
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,870
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

1283
01:24:15,005 --> 01:24:17,166
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1284
01:24:17,274 --> 01:24:18,536
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1285
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:23,079
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1286
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,554
Optimus! Incoming!

1287
01:24:39,263 --> 01:24:40,491
Roll out.

1288
01:24:47,404 --> 01:24:50,737
Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.

1289
01:24:53,611 --> 01:24:57,012
Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.

1290
01:24:57,114 --> 01:24:58,445
Up you get.

1291
01:25:03,153 --> 01:25:05,121
Okay, we're dropping in.

1292
01:25:09,159 --> 01:25:11,753
Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.

1293
01:25:11,862 --> 01:25:14,023
Ship one and two, come on in.

1294
01:25:15,099 --> 01:25:17,727
That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.

1295
01:25:17,835 --> 01:25:21,100
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.

1296
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:23,197
I got it. 12:00.

1297
01:25:27,278 --> 01:25:28,711
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1298
01:25:31,682 --> 01:25:33,877
Got him going down the street.

1299
01:25:37,488 --> 01:25:42,050
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?

1300
01:25:42,393 --> 01:25:44,554
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.

1301
01:25:45,129 --> 01:25:47,120
Okay, we're coming around.

1302
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:11,344
Easy, you two.

1303
01:26:20,731 --> 01:26:23,962
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1304
01:26:24,635 --> 01:26:27,627
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1305
01:26:28,872 --> 01:26:30,931
- Hold on!
- No!

1306
01:26:34,645 --> 01:26:35,873
Sam!

1307
01:26:41,485 --> 01:26:44,613
All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.

1308
01:26:44,722 --> 01:26:45,984
I'm in for the shot.

1309
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:47,523
Stop! Stop!

1310
01:26:48,726 --> 01:26:50,523
Wait! No!

1311
01:26:53,897 --> 01:26:56,491
- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.

1312
01:26:57,067 --> 01:26:58,261
No!

1313
01:27:14,351 --> 01:27:16,444
No! Stop!

1314
01:27:17,054 --> 01:27:18,351
Stop!

1315
01:27:18,956 --> 01:27:22,392
Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!

1316
01:27:23,394 --> 01:27:24,725
What? Okay.

1317
01:27:26,597 --> 01:27:28,758
Look, he's not fighting back!

1318
01:27:29,366 --> 01:27:31,561
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1319
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:39,499
Stop hurting him!

1320
01:27:48,919 --> 01:27:50,614
Don't let him move!

1321
01:27:51,355 --> 01:27:52,913
I got him here!

1322
01:28:16,113 --> 01:28:17,171
No!

1323
01:28:21,185 --> 01:28:22,982
Happy to see me again?

1324
01:28:24,488 --> 01:28:27,218
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1325
01:28:33,096 --> 01:28:36,156
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1326
01:28:44,341 --> 01:28:46,605
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1327
01:28:49,446 --> 01:28:50,845
Optimus,

1328
01:28:53,183 --> 01:28:55,651
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1329
01:28:55,752 --> 01:28:59,449
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1330
01:28:59,556 --> 01:29:02,354
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1331
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:16,737
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1332
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:17,966
in the western Pacific.

1333
01:29:18,075 --> 01:29:20,270
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1334
01:29:20,377 --> 01:29:23,141
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1335
01:29:27,484 --> 01:29:30,351
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1336
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:31,785
of cruise missile range.

1337
01:29:31,889 --> 01:29:35,416
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1338
01:29:35,526 --> 01:29:37,494
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

1339
01:29:39,897 --> 01:29:44,960
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1340
01:29:45,068 --> 01:29:48,265
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

1341
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:53,899
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1342
01:29:57,548 --> 01:30:00,210
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1343
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:02,717
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

1344
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:04,480
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1345
01:30:04,588 --> 01:30:07,022
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1346
01:30:08,058 --> 01:30:09,025
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1347
01:30:09,126 --> 01:30:12,118
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1348
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:13,321
The blackout's global.

1349
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:16,263
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1350
01:30:16,366 --> 01:30:20,894
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1351
01:30:26,843 --> 01:30:31,143
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1352
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,516
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1353
01:30:38,589 --> 01:30:40,147
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1354
01:30:40,257 --> 01:30:42,350
you won't understand right away.

1355
01:30:42,459 --> 01:30:45,792
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1356
01:30:45,896 --> 01:30:49,297
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1357
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:54,263
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1358
01:30:55,372 --> 01:30:59,638
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1359
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:02,510
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1360
01:31:03,113 --> 01:31:05,638
This was classified above top secret.

1361
01:31:20,631 --> 01:31:23,259
EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.

1362
01:31:23,367 --> 01:31:25,995
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1363
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,363
This is the image from Mars.

1364
01:31:30,207 --> 01:31:32,971
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1365
01:31:33,076 --> 01:31:34,839
from the base attack.

1366
01:31:35,612 --> 01:31:38,706
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1367
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:42,347
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1368
01:31:42,753 --> 01:31:45,415
Are we talking about an invasion?

1369
01:31:45,522 --> 01:31:48,616
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1370
01:31:48,725 --> 01:31:52,058
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1371
01:31:52,162 --> 01:31:53,891
That's why the virus shut us down,

1372
01:31:53,997 --> 01:31:57,296
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1373
01:31:57,401 --> 01:32:01,895
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1374
01:32:05,776 --> 01:32:08,108
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1375
01:32:08,211 --> 01:32:11,612
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1376
01:32:11,715 --> 01:32:15,048
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1377
01:32:15,152 --> 01:32:18,121
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1378
01:32:28,331 --> 01:32:31,596
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1379
01:32:31,702 --> 01:32:32,669
Let's go!

1380
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:39,198
She's in here.

1381
01:32:39,576 --> 01:32:41,237
What's going on?

1382
01:32:41,778 --> 01:32:43,609
You're coming with me.

1383
01:32:44,047 --> 01:32:46,743
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?

1384
01:32:47,751 --> 01:32:49,082
Who's this?

1385
01:32:49,853 --> 01:32:52,947
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.

1386
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:06,725
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1387
01:33:07,804 --> 01:33:12,070
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1388
01:33:12,175 --> 01:33:13,142
Wow.

1389
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:14,936
Who knew?

1390
01:33:31,728 --> 01:33:33,628
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1391
01:33:44,441 --> 01:33:47,171
Please, let this work.

1392
01:33:48,578 --> 01:33:50,478
Fire it up, Optimus.

1393
01:33:51,448 --> 01:33:52,938
The code.

1394
01:33:53,049 --> 01:33:58,453
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1395
01:34:00,257 --> 01:34:04,057
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1396
01:34:05,228 --> 01:34:06,991
They must know it's here, as well.

1397
01:34:07,097 --> 01:34:08,428
What about Bumblebee?

1398
01:34:08,532 --> 01:34:12,593
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1399
01:34:12,702 --> 01:34:16,695
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1400
01:34:16,807 --> 01:34:21,039
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1401
01:34:21,144 --> 01:34:24,079
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1402
01:34:25,482 --> 01:34:28,849
They're a primitive and violent race.

1403
01:34:31,188 --> 01:34:33,179
Were we so different?

1404
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:38,459
They're a young species.
They have much to learn.

1405
01:34:38,562 --> 01:34:41,360
But I've seen goodness in them.

1406
01:34:41,464 --> 01:34:45,628
Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.

1407
01:34:45,735 --> 01:34:49,967
You all know there's only one way
to end this war.

1408
01:34:50,073 --> 01:34:52,769
We must destroy the Cube.

1409
01:34:53,577 --> 01:34:58,139
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1410
01:34:58,248 --> 01:34:59,579
That's suicide.

1411
01:34:59,683 --> 01:35:03,483
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1412
01:35:03,587 --> 01:35:08,047
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1413
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:11,457
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1414
01:35:12,929 --> 01:35:15,625
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1415
01:35:15,732 --> 01:35:19,532
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

1416
01:35:31,581 --> 01:35:34,744
Team attention! Present arms!

1417
01:35:35,418 --> 01:35:39,650
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1418
01:35:39,756 --> 01:35:41,451
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1419
01:35:41,558 --> 01:35:43,685
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1420
01:35:43,793 --> 01:35:45,055
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1421
01:35:45,161 --> 01:35:48,255
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1422
01:35:49,766 --> 01:35:50,994
Hey, kid.

1423
01:35:51,782 --> 01:35:54,444
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1424
01:35:54,986 --> 01:35:56,078
You must be hungry?

1425
01:35:56,187 --> 01:35:58,178
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1426
01:35:58,289 --> 01:35:59,916
Where's my car?

1427
01:36:00,024 --> 01:36:03,585
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1428
01:36:04,095 --> 01:36:05,790
People can die here.

1429
01:36:06,163 --> 01:36:08,859
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1430
01:36:08,966 --> 01:36:10,160
Okay.

1431
01:36:10,267 --> 01:36:13,998
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1432
01:36:14,105 --> 01:36:18,804
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1433
01:36:20,444 --> 01:36:23,413
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1434
01:36:23,514 --> 01:36:24,811
Thank you.

1435
01:36:26,283 --> 01:36:28,012
The man's an extortionist.

1436
01:36:29,754 --> 01:36:31,085
All right, here's the situation.

1437
01:36:31,188 --> 01:36:33,588
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1438
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:34,783
NBEs?

1439
01:36:34,892 --> 01:36:38,487
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1440
01:36:38,596 --> 01:36:42,225
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1441
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:51,976
Dear God. What is this?

1442
01:36:51,976 --> 01:36:53,238
Dear God. What is this?

1443
01:36:54,812 --> 01:36:58,077
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1444
01:36:58,182 --> 01:37:01,618
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1445
01:37:01,719 --> 01:37:05,712
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1446
01:37:05,823 --> 01:37:09,088
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1447
01:37:09,193 --> 01:37:11,593
We call him NBE One.

1448
01:37:11,696 --> 01:37:14,062
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1449
01:37:14,165 --> 01:37:16,565
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1450
01:37:17,835 --> 01:37:19,666
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1451
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:23,103
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1452
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:26,716
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1453
01:37:26,788 --> 01:37:27,921
in the history of mankind.

1454
01:37:28,523 --> 01:37:31,458
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1455
01:37:31,559 --> 01:37:38,397
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1456
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:42,300
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1457
01:37:42,871 --> 01:37:45,499
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1458
01:37:45,607 --> 01:37:47,973
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1459
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:52,069
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1460
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:54,045
Well, you got one now.

1461
01:37:54,983 --> 01:37:57,383
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1462
01:37:57,485 --> 01:37:59,009
All Spark? What is that?

1463
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,680
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1464
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:06,557
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

1465
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:09,095
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1466
01:38:09,197 --> 01:38:12,291
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1467
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,924
That's their plan.

1468
01:38:14,035 --> 01:38:16,435
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1469
01:38:18,773 --> 01:38:21,037
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1470
01:38:22,477 --> 01:38:23,603
Follow me.

1471
01:38:27,248 --> 01:38:29,739
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1472
01:38:38,693 --> 01:38:42,254
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1473
01:38:43,164 --> 01:38:46,793
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1474
01:38:47,635 --> 01:38:51,503
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1475
01:38:51,606 --> 01:38:53,130
as well as NBE One.

1476
01:38:53,241 --> 01:38:55,801
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1477
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:58,276
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1478
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:01,713
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1479
01:39:01,816 --> 01:39:05,411
or any alien species on the outside.

1480
01:39:14,112 --> 01:39:15,412
spark

1481
01:39:18,313 --> 01:39:20,813
starscream

1482
01:39:22,114 --> 01:39:24,914
barricade

1483
01:39:27,015 --> 01:39:28,415
devastator

1484
01:39:35,116 --> 01:39:36,316
bonecrusher

1485
01:39:38,617 --> 01:39:40,017
blackout

1486
01:39:41,018 --> 01:39:42,918
all hail

1487
01:39:44,225 --> 01:39:48,025
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1488
01:39:48,663 --> 01:39:51,154
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1489
01:39:55,737 --> 01:39:58,604
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1490
01:40:04,512 --> 01:40:06,173
Oh, wow.

1491
01:40:06,281 --> 01:40:08,306
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1492
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:09,610
Oh, no, man.

1493
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:14,211
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1494
01:40:14,322 --> 01:40:17,257
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1495
01:40:18,793 --> 01:40:21,819
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1496
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:23,363
I got a phone.

1497
01:40:26,568 --> 01:40:29,162
Nokias are real nasty.

1498
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:33,707
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1499
01:40:34,509 --> 01:40:36,636
Nokia's from Finland.

1500
01:40:36,744 --> 01:40:41,306
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1501
01:40:44,085 --> 01:40:49,648
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1502
01:41:03,338 --> 01:41:06,637
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

1503
01:41:06,741 --> 01:41:10,404
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1504
01:41:21,422 --> 01:41:23,287
He's breaking the box.

1505
01:41:41,276 --> 01:41:42,402
Go! Go! Go!

1506
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:43,602
Move!

1507
01:41:52,153 --> 01:41:54,781
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1508
01:41:55,557 --> 01:41:56,888
Banachek. What's going on?

1509
01:41:56,991 --> 01:41:58,822
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1510
01:41:58,927 --> 01:41:59,985
- What?
...and the backup generator

1511
01:42:00,094 --> 01:42:02,062
- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?

1512
01:42:08,469 --> 01:42:10,232
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1513
01:42:10,338 --> 01:42:11,737
I'll bring security to the...

1514
01:42:11,839 --> 01:42:14,364
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1515
01:42:14,475 --> 01:42:16,067
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1516
01:42:16,177 --> 01:42:17,542
Let's go!

1517
01:42:17,645 --> 01:42:19,408
They're popping our generators!

1518
01:42:31,426 --> 01:42:32,791
Megatron melting!

1519
01:42:33,428 --> 01:42:36,488
16502. We're losing pressure.

1520
01:42:36,598 --> 01:42:38,793
Stand by! Set!

1521
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,959
We're losing pressure!

1522
01:42:41,069 --> 01:42:44,505
The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!

1523
01:42:49,244 --> 01:42:51,940
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1524
01:42:52,046 --> 01:42:56,039
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1525
01:43:01,589 --> 01:43:04,217
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1526
01:43:04,325 --> 01:43:05,349
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1527
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:07,394
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1528
01:43:07,495 --> 01:43:09,224
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1529
01:43:09,330 --> 01:43:10,592
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1530
01:43:10,698 --> 01:43:12,063
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1531
01:43:12,166 --> 01:43:14,157
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1532
01:43:14,269 --> 01:43:15,998
Take him to his car!

1533
01:43:17,739 --> 01:43:18,933
Drop it.

1534
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:22,369
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1535
01:43:23,645 --> 01:43:25,636
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1536
01:43:26,147 --> 01:43:27,876
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1537
01:43:27,982 --> 01:43:29,006
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1538
01:43:29,117 --> 01:43:31,312
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1539
01:43:31,419 --> 01:43:32,579
S-Seven don't exist.

1540
01:43:32,687 --> 01:43:34,450
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1541
01:43:34,555 --> 01:43:37,820
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1542
01:43:40,428 --> 01:43:42,055
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

1543
01:43:42,163 --> 01:43:46,224
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1544
01:43:50,738 --> 01:43:52,706
All right. Okay.

1545
01:43:52,807 --> 01:43:57,437
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1546
01:44:00,882 --> 01:44:02,144
No, no!

1547
01:44:03,117 --> 01:44:05,779
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1548
01:44:05,887 --> 01:44:09,448
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1549
01:44:10,658 --> 01:44:12,057
Are you okay?

1550
01:44:13,928 --> 01:44:16,021
They didn't hurt you, right?

1551
01:44:24,772 --> 01:44:28,572
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1552
01:44:30,978 --> 01:44:33,071
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1553
01:44:33,181 --> 01:44:35,411
They're not gonna hurt you.

1554
01:44:35,516 --> 01:44:39,043
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1555
01:44:39,153 --> 01:44:42,418
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1556
01:44:42,523 --> 01:44:44,013
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1557
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,572
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1558
01:45:29,704 --> 01:45:31,035
Oh, my God.

1559
01:45:35,843 --> 01:45:37,242
Message from Starfleet, Captain.

1560
01:45:37,345 --> 01:45:38,744
Let's get to it.

1561
01:45:38,846 --> 01:45:41,872
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1562
01:45:41,983 --> 01:45:43,382
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1563
01:45:43,484 --> 01:45:44,781
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1564
01:45:44,886 --> 01:45:46,285
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1565
01:45:46,387 --> 01:45:47,354
Good! Right.

1566
01:45:47,455 --> 01:45:50,185
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1567
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:52,350
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1568
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:54,325
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

1569
01:45:54,429 --> 01:45:57,023
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1570
01:45:57,131 --> 01:45:58,564
In the alien archive, sir!

1571
01:45:58,666 --> 01:46:00,657
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1572
01:46:00,768 --> 01:46:02,292
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1573
01:46:02,403 --> 01:46:04,837
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1574
01:46:04,939 --> 01:46:06,702
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1575
01:46:06,808 --> 01:46:08,435
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1576
01:46:08,543 --> 01:46:10,511
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1577
01:46:10,611 --> 01:46:12,135
Affirmative!

1578
01:46:12,246 --> 01:46:16,080
Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.

1579
01:46:17,084 --> 01:46:18,949
Check that backup system!

1580
01:46:19,053 --> 01:46:23,217
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1581
01:46:23,324 --> 01:46:24,814
Come on! Get out of here!

1582
01:46:24,926 --> 01:46:26,450
Heads up! Look out!

1583
01:46:27,462 --> 01:46:29,862
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1584
01:46:29,964 --> 01:46:33,400
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

1585
01:46:43,110 --> 01:46:46,170
I am Megatron!

1586
01:47:04,999 --> 01:47:06,398
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1587
01:47:06,501 --> 01:47:07,490
Well, put the seat belt on.

1588
01:47:07,602 --> 01:47:08,762
Pour it on him!

1589
01:47:22,517 --> 01:47:24,508
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1590
01:47:24,619 --> 01:47:27,019
Where is the Cube?

1591
01:47:27,121 --> 01:47:29,180
The humans have taken it.

1592
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:36,428
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1593
01:47:36,864 --> 01:47:38,331
Come on, Mags!

1594
01:47:39,433 --> 01:47:40,923
Over here, sir!

1595
01:47:43,271 --> 01:47:45,330
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1596
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:47,873
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1597
01:47:49,777 --> 01:47:53,235
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1598
01:47:54,282 --> 01:47:55,271
Mikes?

1599
01:47:55,383 --> 01:47:56,645
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1600
01:47:56,751 --> 01:47:58,309
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1601
01:47:58,419 --> 01:47:59,943
Let's find them.

1602
01:48:00,054 --> 01:48:01,521
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1603
01:48:01,622 --> 01:48:03,783
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

1604
01:48:03,891 --> 01:48:06,951
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1605
01:48:07,061 --> 01:48:08,358
- Glen?
- Huh?

1606
01:48:08,462 --> 01:48:11,954
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1607
01:48:12,066 --> 01:48:13,055
What good is that?

1608
01:48:13,167 --> 01:48:15,567
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1609
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:19,231
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1610
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:21,171
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1611
01:48:32,954 --> 01:48:34,478
There's Optimus.

1612
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,907
Almost done.

1613
01:48:55,743 --> 01:48:57,643
What the hell was that?

1614
01:49:00,715 --> 01:49:02,410
Barricade the door!

1615
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:07,518
- Get something.
- Watch out!

1616
01:49:07,622 --> 01:49:09,715
Six, five, four, six, three.

1617
01:49:14,395 --> 01:49:16,761
Here! Put some rounds in!

1618
01:49:19,634 --> 01:49:21,067
Master search.

1619
01:49:21,969 --> 01:49:23,960
I got it! We're transmitting!

1620
01:49:24,071 --> 01:49:25,197
Send exactly what I say!

1621
01:49:25,306 --> 01:49:29,436
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1622
01:49:29,543 --> 01:49:33,570
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1623
01:49:33,681 --> 01:49:35,205
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1624
01:49:36,917 --> 01:49:37,941
What was that?

1625
01:49:38,052 --> 01:49:40,885
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1626
01:49:43,057 --> 01:49:45,252
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1627
01:50:09,984 --> 01:50:11,952
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1628
01:50:12,053 --> 01:50:15,489
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

1629
01:50:36,711 --> 01:50:37,700
Oh, my God.

1630
01:51:06,273 --> 01:51:07,604
Cool, Mom!

1631
01:51:33,501 --> 01:51:35,492
This is so not good.

1632
01:51:53,988 --> 01:51:55,853
He's behind the pillar!

1633
01:52:01,729 --> 01:52:04,823
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

1634
01:52:07,968 --> 01:52:10,300
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1635
01:52:14,175 --> 01:52:16,143
Sucker, burn!

1636
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:23,247
Oh, shit!

1637
01:52:23,584 --> 01:52:25,609
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1638
01:52:26,821 --> 01:52:28,846
Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.

1639
01:52:30,057 --> 01:52:32,321
Strike and Dark Star roll call.

1640
01:52:46,774 --> 01:52:50,335
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1641
01:52:50,444 --> 01:52:52,639
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1642
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,375
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1643
01:52:55,482 --> 01:52:57,780
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1644
01:52:58,185 --> 01:53:01,177
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1645
01:53:01,288 --> 01:53:04,223
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1646
01:53:04,325 --> 01:53:07,021
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1647
01:53:07,628 --> 01:53:09,220
F-22 at 12:00.

1648
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:12,026
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1649
01:53:12,132 --> 01:53:13,997
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1650
01:53:16,503 --> 01:53:18,903
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1651
01:53:19,206 --> 01:53:20,833
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1652
01:53:22,109 --> 01:53:23,269
We have you visual.

1653
01:53:24,945 --> 01:53:26,276
Green smoke is the mark.

1654
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:29,838
Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.

1655
01:53:34,488 --> 01:53:36,456
It's Starscream!

1656
01:53:36,924 --> 01:53:38,585
Please tell me you copy.

1657
01:53:38,926 --> 01:53:41,224
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1658
01:53:45,032 --> 01:53:47,000
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1659
01:53:47,101 --> 01:53:50,264
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1660
01:53:50,371 --> 01:53:51,599
Incoming!

1661
01:54:16,697 --> 01:54:18,494
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1662
01:54:18,599 --> 01:54:20,066
Clear the area!

1663
01:54:25,873 --> 01:54:27,397
Oh, my God.

1664
01:54:28,275 --> 01:54:31,142
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1665
01:54:31,578 --> 01:54:32,909
Your legs.

1666
01:54:34,481 --> 01:54:38,110
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1667
01:54:39,653 --> 01:54:42,087
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1668
01:54:43,657 --> 01:54:44,851
Ratchet!

1669
01:54:46,727 --> 01:54:48,194
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1670
01:54:48,295 --> 01:54:50,229
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

1671
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:52,697
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1672
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,961
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1673
01:54:55,069 --> 01:54:57,867
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1674
01:54:59,139 --> 01:55:00,163
Come on!

1675
01:55:00,274 --> 01:55:02,401
Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.

1676
01:55:04,178 --> 01:55:06,305
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1677
01:55:06,413 --> 01:55:08,745
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1678
01:55:26,967 --> 01:55:28,400
Move out! Let's go!

1679
01:55:43,150 --> 01:55:44,811
I'm not gonna leave you.

1680
01:56:23,924 --> 01:56:25,949
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1681
01:56:32,266 --> 01:56:33,790
Oh, my God!

1682
01:56:46,346 --> 01:56:48,280
Concentrate your fire!

1683
01:56:59,193 --> 01:57:00,387
Come on. Come on.

1684
01:57:02,963 --> 01:57:04,658
Megatron!

1685
01:57:09,369 --> 01:57:13,032
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1686
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:18,903
Fall back!

1687
01:57:24,918 --> 01:57:27,113
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1688
01:57:27,221 --> 01:57:29,246
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1689
01:57:29,356 --> 01:57:31,620
We need air cover down here now!

1690
01:57:37,631 --> 01:57:39,030
Sam, help me with this.

1691
01:57:43,203 --> 01:57:47,537
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

1692
01:57:47,641 --> 01:57:49,734
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1693
01:57:49,843 --> 01:57:52,141
No! I want two!

1694
01:57:53,714 --> 01:57:55,113
What's going on?

1695
01:57:56,917 --> 01:57:59,545
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1696
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:02,684
Oh, these things just don't die.

1697
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:07,750
Oh, we're so dead.

1698
01:58:07,861 --> 01:58:10,193
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1699
01:58:10,497 --> 01:58:11,486
Where's the Cube?

1700
01:58:11,598 --> 01:58:12,565
- Right there.
- Okay.

1701
01:58:12,666 --> 01:58:13,655
And take that and wrap it around

1702
01:58:13,767 --> 01:58:14,734
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1703
01:58:14,835 --> 01:58:17,497
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1704
01:58:18,939 --> 01:58:20,406
That building.

1705
01:58:24,178 --> 01:58:25,975
- Okay.
- What?

1706
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:29,048
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1707
01:58:29,149 --> 01:58:31,413
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

1708
01:58:31,518 --> 01:58:33,713
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1709
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:35,754
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

1710
01:58:35,856 --> 01:58:40,259
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1711
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:42,590
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1712
01:58:42,696 --> 01:58:44,755
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1713
01:58:44,898 --> 01:58:46,388
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

1714
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,660
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

1715
01:58:47,768 --> 01:58:50,464
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1716
01:58:51,939 --> 01:58:52,997
Army Black Hawk requested.

1717
01:58:53,106 --> 01:58:55,631
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1718
01:58:55,742 --> 01:58:58,267
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1719
01:58:58,378 --> 01:59:01,472
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

1720
01:59:03,083 --> 01:59:06,416
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

1721
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:14,520
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1722
01:59:17,764 --> 01:59:20,392
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1723
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:23,731
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

1724
01:59:26,473 --> 01:59:28,566
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1725
01:59:35,015 --> 01:59:36,312
Watch out!

1726
01:59:41,922 --> 01:59:44,948
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

1727
01:59:45,058 --> 01:59:46,719
Get out of here now!

1728
02:00:14,588 --> 02:00:15,555
Megatron!

1729
02:00:15,856 --> 02:00:16,823
Prime.

1730
02:00:42,783 --> 02:00:44,842
Humans don't deserve to live.

1731
02:00:44,951 --> 02:00:47,613
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1732
02:00:48,055 --> 02:00:50,421
Then you will die with them!

1733
02:00:56,096 --> 02:00:58,496
Join them in extinction!

1734
02:01:17,718 --> 02:01:19,379
Keep moving, Sam!

1735
02:01:20,387 --> 02:01:21,752
Don't stop!

1736
02:01:37,771 --> 02:01:38,760
No!

1737
02:01:53,987 --> 02:01:56,080
Sam, get to the building!

1738
02:02:03,997 --> 02:02:06,124
Give me that Cube, boy!

1739
02:02:18,779 --> 02:02:20,872
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1740
02:02:42,235 --> 02:02:45,693
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1741
02:02:51,011 --> 02:02:54,139
I smell you, boy!

1742
02:03:06,359 --> 02:03:07,519
Maggot!

1743
02:03:26,546 --> 02:03:28,138
Oh, no!

1744
02:03:52,706 --> 02:03:54,537
I'll drive! You shoot!

1745
02:04:15,495 --> 02:04:16,792
This isn't going well!

1746
02:04:16,897 --> 02:04:18,296
Shoot! Shoot!

1747
02:05:04,144 --> 02:05:05,372
Nice shot.

1748
02:05:05,478 --> 02:05:08,936
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

1749
02:05:19,426 --> 02:05:20,484
Hey!

1750
02:05:23,964 --> 02:05:27,400
Hey! I'm over here!

1751
02:05:39,746 --> 02:05:41,441
We've got the boy.

1752
02:05:46,052 --> 02:05:47,485
Watch out!

1753
02:05:47,854 --> 02:05:49,048
Missile!

1754
02:05:59,532 --> 02:06:00,965
Hang on, Sam!

1755
02:06:09,709 --> 02:06:11,040
No! No!

1756
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:21,778
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1757
02:06:35,335 --> 02:06:36,802
Where do I go?

1758
02:06:38,138 --> 02:06:42,097
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1759
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:45,037
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1760
02:06:49,215 --> 02:06:51,649
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1761
02:06:51,785 --> 02:06:54,583
Oh, so unwise.

1762
02:07:06,533 --> 02:07:08,023
I got you, boy.

1763
02:07:09,836 --> 02:07:11,633
Hold on to the Cube!

1764
02:07:31,324 --> 02:07:34,191
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

1765
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:40,223
Sam?

1766
02:07:44,504 --> 02:07:47,735
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1767
02:07:48,475 --> 02:07:49,942
No sacrifice,

1768
02:07:51,311 --> 02:07:54,371
- no victory.
- Lf I cannot defeat Megatron,

1769
02:07:54,714 --> 02:07:57,205
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1770
02:07:57,617 --> 02:08:00,814
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1771
02:08:01,287 --> 02:08:02,754
Get behind me.

1772
02:08:04,457 --> 02:08:07,017
It's you and me, Megatron.

1773
02:08:07,127 --> 02:08:10,062
No, it's just me, Prime.

1774
02:08:12,499 --> 02:08:17,630
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1775
02:08:23,042 --> 02:08:27,877
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1776
02:08:47,033 --> 02:08:49,433
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1777
02:08:49,536 --> 02:08:52,004
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1778
02:08:52,105 --> 02:08:53,129
Hey.

1779
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:56,501
Bring the rain. All right?

1780
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:58,901
All right, let's kill these things.

1781
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,438
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

1782
02:09:02,549 --> 02:09:04,540
Armor's weak under the chest.

1783
02:09:14,627 --> 02:09:16,185
Target marked. Still waiting.

1784
02:09:16,296 --> 02:09:18,321
Time on target, 20 seconds.

1785
02:09:25,271 --> 02:09:27,364
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1786
02:09:32,612 --> 02:09:34,045
Move out!

1787
02:09:37,283 --> 02:09:38,511
Incoming!

1788
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:49,153
Weapons armed. Status green.

1789
02:10:07,814 --> 02:10:09,645
Run! Move!

1790
02:10:17,156 --> 02:10:18,680
Second wave's on approach.

1791
02:10:22,195 --> 02:10:23,787
What is that? Break off!

1792
02:10:23,897 --> 02:10:26,365
- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...

1793
02:10:35,108 --> 02:10:37,269
Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!

1794
02:10:41,347 --> 02:10:43,440
Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.

1795
02:10:43,816 --> 02:10:45,113
Take him out!

1796
02:10:59,332 --> 02:11:00,663
Two's down!

1797
02:11:10,109 --> 02:11:12,043
I'll kill you!

1798
02:11:12,145 --> 02:11:14,909
Mine! All Spark!

1799
02:11:15,882 --> 02:11:18,749
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1800
02:11:19,452 --> 02:11:20,476
Sam!

1801
02:11:21,354 --> 02:11:22,548
No, Sam!

1802
02:11:48,381 --> 02:11:49,541
Hold up.

1803
02:11:52,652 --> 02:11:55,621
You left me no choice, brother.

1804
02:12:05,231 --> 02:12:08,098
Sam, I owe you my life.

1805
02:12:09,235 --> 02:12:10,964
We are in your debt.

1806
02:12:30,490 --> 02:12:32,890
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1807
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:35,057
Jazz.

1808
02:12:38,264 --> 02:12:40,459
We lost a great comrade

1809
02:12:41,801 --> 02:12:43,666
but gained new ones.

1810
02:12:43,936 --> 02:12:46,234
Thank you, all of you.

1811
02:12:46,572 --> 02:12:48,938
You honor us with your bravery.

1812
02:12:49,976 --> 02:12:51,944
Permission to speak, sir?

1813
02:12:52,445 --> 02:12:55,312
Permission granted, old friend.

1814
02:12:55,415 --> 02:12:56,882
You speak now?

1815
02:12:57,817 --> 02:12:59,910
I wish to stay with the boy.

1816
02:13:00,787 --> 02:13:02,618
If that is his choice.

1817
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,584
Yes.

1818
02:13:29,248 --> 02:13:33,981
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1819
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:37,546
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1820
02:13:38,191 --> 02:13:41,490
The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,

1821
02:13:41,594 --> 02:13:43,687
deepest place on our planet.

1822
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:47,457
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,

1823
02:13:47,567 --> 02:13:49,762
would crush and entomb them,

1824
02:13:51,571 --> 02:13:53,300
leaving no evidence.

1825
02:13:59,946 --> 02:14:04,349
With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.

1826
02:14:06,085 --> 02:14:08,679
And fate has yielded its reward,

1827
02:14:10,223 --> 02:14:13,124
a new world to call home.

1828
02:14:19,398 --> 02:14:23,596
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,

1829
02:14:23,736 --> 02:14:26,500
but watching over them in secret,

1830
02:14:26,739 --> 02:14:29,299
waiting, protecting.

1831
02:14:30,710 --> 02:14:33,736
I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.

1832
02:14:34,347 --> 02:14:37,339
And though we are worlds apart,

1833
02:14:37,450 --> 02:14:42,387
like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.

1834
02:14:43,923 --> 02:14:46,414
I am Optimus Prime

1835
02:14:46,826 --> 02:14:50,193
and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots

1836
02:14:50,296 --> 02:14:53,288
taking refuge among the stars.

1837
02:14:54,333 --> 02:14:56,062
We are here.

1838
02:14:56,636 --> 02:14:58,661
We are waiting.

1839
02:15:17,957 --> 02:15:22,985
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1840
02:15:25,998 --> 02:15:31,493
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1841
02:15:32,104 --> 02:15:34,004
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1842
02:15:34,373 --> 02:15:36,807
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1843
02:15:36,909 --> 02:15:38,570
The government would let us know.

1844
02:15:38,744 --> 02:15:40,336
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

1845
02:15:40,446 --> 02:15:42,880
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1846
02:15:42,982 --> 02:15:44,609
because there's no secrets.

1847
02:15:44,717 --> 02:15:46,810
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1848
02:15:56,862 --> 02:16:00,161
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
