一件臭名昭著的藝術品水晶頭骨

被偷。

7
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,450
這顯然不是第一個水晶頭骨被偷。
This is apparently not the first crystal skull to be taken

8
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,530
並且，根據博物館館長所說，

00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,690
過去兩年已有至少六個頭骨。

我認為它是真實的。

18
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,320
毫無疑問。
Without a doubt.

19
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,750
你看，我的僱主會很失望。
You see, my employer would be very disappointed

20
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,620
如果它被證明是偽造的。
if it turned out to be a forgery.

21
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
你是怎麼搞到這件藝術品的？
How did you obtain the artifact?

22
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,660
考慮到我的業務性質，
Given the nature of my business,

23
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,360
你可以理解為什麼我不能透露這些細節。
you can understand why I cannot reveal such details.

24
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,470
運輸和銷售此類文物

大概有嚴格的規定。。

26
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,470
再說一次，我的僱主非常希望
Again, my employer would be very-

27
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,700
你的老闆希望要麼我出價要麼他不想要。
Your employer either wants what I have to offer or he does not.

28
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,110
在這種情況下，我有其他買家要見。
In which case, I have other buyers to meet.

29
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,580
你沒必要行駛200英里到安第斯山脈。
You didn't travel 200 miles up into the Andes

30
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,590
如果你有其他買家。
if you had other buyers.

31
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,360
那麼我們準備好談生意了？對不？
Then we are ready to do business? Yes?

32
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,190
當您聯繫您的代表，
When you contacted our representative,

33
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,290
您的留言有一定的購買價格。
your message included a certain purchase price.

34
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,040
我想那數額比較公道。
And I believe the amount was more than fair.

35
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,730
因為確實我的僱主。
As does my employer.

36
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,030
你有你的項目？
Do you have the item with you?

37
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,580
我不是一個傻瓜，米切爾先生。
I'm not a fool, Mr. Mitchell.

38
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,840
但就在附近。
But it is close by.

39
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,920
帶錢了沒？
Do you have the money?

40
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,550
我也不是一個傻瓜。
I'm not a fool either.

41
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,760
跟我走。
Follow me.

42
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,450
要不要點下？
You going to count it?

43
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,460
沒必要。
That will not be necessary.

44
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,620
那麼，我的朋友，
Then, my friend,

45
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,760
我們交易完了。
we're finished here.

46
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,740
你擔心的事情已經發生了。
What you have feared has come true.

47
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,770
我擔心什麼？
And what have I feared?

48
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,470
他在收集頭骨。
He's gathering the skulls.

49
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,340
他明白那聚集一起可以擁有權力。
He understands that together they have power.

50
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,510
誰？
Who?

51
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,710
財主。
The rich man.

52
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,520
富人。
The infidel, Hadden.

53
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
他是一個老人，
He's an old man,

54
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,820
一個受權力夢驅使的無知的人。
a foolish man who is driven by dreams of power

55
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,590
來自於頭骨。
derived from the skulls.

56
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,960
他是個危險的人，你不懂嗎？
He is a dangerous man, you understand?

57
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,490
是的，我明白，但真正的危險是。
Yes, I understand, but the real danger is that

58
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,500
沒有第十三頭骨
without the thirteenth skull

59
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,560
將沒有法來控制它們。
there will be no way to control them.

60
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,330
其他12個可能變得不穩定。
The other twelve could become unstable

61
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,940
並造成大規模破壞。
and cause massive destruction.

62
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,540
這就是兄弟會給你這個任務的原因。
This is why the brotherhood has given you a task.

63
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,670
會有殺戮。
There will be bloodshed.

64
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,870
你是在徵求我的同意還是我的意見？
Are you asking me for my approval or my opinion?

65
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,170
我不需要你批准。
I don't need your approval.

66
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,780
那麼我的觀點是沒必要暴力，
Then my opinion is that there is no need for violence,

67
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,510
只是阻止他。
he just needs to be stopped.

68
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,150
傻瓜才信一個富人會被阻止。
You're a fool to believe a rich man can be stopped

69
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,750
而不是通過殺戮。
without bloodshed.

70
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,030
我知道你有一個使命，我祝你好運，
I understand you have a mission and I wish you good luck,

71
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,660
但別讓你的憤怒害了你，侯賽因。
but don't let your anger poison you, Hussein.

72
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,900
korallgrottan洞穴，瑞典

73
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,470
檢查所有設備。
Check all your equipment.

74
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,540
確保我們有足夠長的繩子？
You sure we have enough rope?

75
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,480
你肯定東西在那嗎？
You sure there's something down there?

76
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,350
我不會做。
I wouldn't be doing this

77
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,020
如果我不確認東西在下面。
if I didn't think there was something down there.

78
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,750
你知道我是怎麼想海拔，泰利。
You know how I feel about heights, Terry.

79
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,550
別擔心。
Don't worry about it.

80
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,020
我何曾讓你失望？
Have I ever let you down?

81
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,460
3，4次，上衣。
Three, four times, tops.

82
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,150
登山是我的強項。
Climbing is my business.

83
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,190
你只需要別抱怨了。
You're just gonna have to suck it up.

84
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,830
看看那個，哥哥。
Look at that, bro.

85
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
去容易。
Go easy...

86
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,330
邊上。
...over the lip.

87
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,530
呼！
Whooo!

88
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,950
穩住，哥哥。
Go steady, bro.

89
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
瞧那個！
Look at that!

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,340
耶。
Yeah.

91
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,510
不會吧。
Holy cow.

92

是這裏。
It was here.

93
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,910
是嗎？你怎麼這麼肯定？
Yeah? How can you be so sure?

94
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,460
這是他筆記本筆記本裏最後參觀的地方。
This is the last place in his notebook that he visited.

95

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,630
我們最終會發現它。

好了，你是冒險家。
Well, you're the adventurer.

101
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,800
妻子會認為與該。
The wife would argue with that.

102
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,140
她說，我是一個榮耀的導遊。
She says I'm a glorified tour guide.

103
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,070
洙導遊。
So guide.

104
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,570

他描述了這條隧道。

我們都知道，

我不認為你想知道的是，馬洛裏小姐。

是他嗎？
Is that him?

139
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,540
你不認為他會錯過這一刻，你呢？
You didn't think he'd miss this moment, do you?

140
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,770
哈登先生？
Mr. Hadden?

141
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,570

144
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,020
我不知道還能活多久，
I don't know how much time I may have left,

145
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,060
所以我們不要再浪費時間了。
so let's not waste any more of it.

146
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,390
正常嗎？
Is that normal?

147
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,140
同時，據我們所知，
Well, as far as we're aware,

148
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,670
這是第一次的頭骨團聚
this is the first time the skulls have been reunited

149
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,140
人類歷史上。
in the history of mankind.

150
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
發生了什麼？
What's happening?

151
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,640
有聲波振動16赫茲。
There's sonic vibration at sixteen hertz.

152
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,740
我覺得有些不舒服。
I feel a little sick.

153
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,550
我不知道他們是如何做的，
I don't know how they're doing it,

154
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,020
但這些東西都產生自己的磁場。
but these things are generating their own magnetic field.

155
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,280
這是不可能的。
That's not possible.

156
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,710
告訴他們。
Tell them that.

157
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,290
什麼好說的？
What's it say?

158
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,430
週四晚上是女士之夜。
Thursday night is ladies night.

159
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,500
所有的女人都會被錄取，無蓋。
All women will be admitted, no cover.

160
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,060
所有飲料2束縛。
All drinks two shackles.

161
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,230
什麼？
What?

162
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,530
我不知道。
I have no idea.

163
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,100
但他們在爸爸的書。
But they're in dad's book.

164
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,540
12不同的符號。
Twelve distinct symbols.

165
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,450
你怎麼能知道，聰明的傢伙。
How can you know that, smart guy

166
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,120
如果你不知道他們說什麼。
if you don't even know what they say.

167
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,760
好吧，我並不需要能夠把它們翻譯。
Well, I don't need to be able to translate them

168
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,860
為了知道是阿卡迪亞，
in order to know that is Acadian,

169
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,190
這是埃及，
this is Egyptian,

170
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,060
那些在這裏我真的不認識。
those over here I don't really recognize.

171
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,290
這一點，這看起來前哥倫布。
This, this looks pre-Colombian.

172
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,400
最有可能的瑪雅。
Most likely Mayan.

173
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,340
南美？
South American?

174
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,700
地獄的是這裏做什麼？
What the hell's it doing here?

175
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,070
正是。
Exactly.

176
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,710
預巴比倫，蘇美爾，我們已經得到了埃及，瑪雅可能。
Pre-Babylonian, Sumerian, we've got Egyptian, possibly Mayan.

177
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,480
我的猜測是它的十二個不同的組。
My guess is it's twelve different groups

178
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,680
代表不同的早期文明。
representing a different early civilization.

179
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,790
有啥第十三呢？
So what's the thirteenth for?

180
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
我的意思是，你已經有了12組符號，
I mean, you've got twelve sets of symbols,

181
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,990
12文明古國，12頭骨。
twelve ancient civilizations, twelve skulls.

182
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,690
如果真的有第十三個頭骨，
If there really is a thirteenth skull,

183
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,850
那是什麼呢？
what's that about?

184
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,430
是，我的朋友，是一個很好的問題。
That, my friend, is a good question.

185
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,400
我真的不知道在這一點上，
I really have no idea at this point,

186
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,030
但我敢肯定，我會找到了。
but I'm sure I'm gonna find out.

187
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,940
我想我會嘔吐！
I think I'm gonna puke!

188
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,910
是的，它的頻率。
Yeah, it's the frequency.

189
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,750
某些調製引起噁心。
Certain modulations cause nausea.

190
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,950
七赫茲，它可能會導致你的身體來分開。
At seven hertz, it can cause your body to come apart

191
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,220
在核級。
at a nuclear level.

192
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,620
已關閉的規模！
Is off the scale!

193
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
我們會失去它。清理房間。
We're gonna lose it. Clear the room.

194
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
清理房間！
Clear the room!

195
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,070
讓他們離開那裏！
Get them out of there!

196
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,300
我們試圖激活關閉
We've tried to activate the shut-down-

197
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,170
只是做我告訴你！
Just do what I tell you!

198
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
哇。
Whoa.

199
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,490
你摸了什麼？
What'd you touch?

200
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,570
沒！我什麼都沒做！
Nothing! I didn't do anything!

201
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,940
我告訴你不要碰任何東西！
I told you not to touch anything!

202
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
哇。
Wow.

203
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,470
北約空軍基地
薩拉戈薩,西班牙

204
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,550
紅色代碼。
Code Level Red

205
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,200
上校，脈衝消散。
Colonel, the pulse has dissipated.

206
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,240
我們有一個核爆炸的任何報告？
Do we have any reports of a nuclear detonation?

207
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,390
消極的，先生。
Negative, sir.

208
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,030
什麼？
Nothing?

209
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
沒有，先生。
No, sir.

210
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:14,860
沒有。
Nothing.

211
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,100
衛星或地震。
Satellite or seismic.

212
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,110
那麼到底是什麼呢？
Then what the hell was it?

213
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,680
我們挑upan電磁爆，
We've picked up an electro-magnetic burst,

214
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,340
而且似乎它起源於維也納。
and it appears it's originated in Vienna.

215
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
維也納？
Vienna?

216
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,880
奧地利維也納？
Vienna, Austria?

217
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,540
作為莫扎特和巧克力？
As in Mozart and chocolates?

218
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,680
這是正確的，先生。
That's correct, sir.

219
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
好吧。
Alright.

220
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,390
手錶的指揮官，把我們帶回了黃色。
Commander of the watch, take us back to yellow.

221
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

222
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,350
電磁脈衝不只是憑空出現的。
Electra-magnetic pulses don't just come out of nowhere.

223
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,630
瞭解，先生。
Roger that, sir.

224
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
主要。
Major.

225
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,010
告訴參謀長聯席會議他們會知道那是什麼，當我知道這是什麼。
Tell the joint chiefs they'll know what it was when I know what it was.

226
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,670
這一切恢復正常，除了。
All of it is back to normal except...

227
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,740
頭骨仍產生一個字段。
The skulls are still generating a field.

228
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
正是。
Exactly.

229
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,400
他們保持穩定的時刻，按鈕
They're holding steady for the moment, but-

230
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
你看到發生了什麼。
You saw what happened.

231
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,640
是的，當然。
Yes, of course.

232
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,280
好了，我們知道，頭骨具有獨特的磁性特質。
Well, we knew that the skulls possess unique magnetic qualities.

233
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,220
如果你的理論是正確的，第十三應該有─
If your theory was correct, the thirteenth should have-

234
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,450
本來應該能夠控制他人。
Should have been able to control the others.

235
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,720
理論是沒有問題的。
The theory isn't the problem.

236
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,760
的問題是，這不是第十三顱骨。
The problem is that that wasn't the thirteenth skull.

237
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,630
你不是在責怪我，他的公雞了，是嗎？
You're not blaming this cock-up on me, are you?

238
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,030
到底誰應該去責備這個不折不扣的災難，
Who exactly should we blame for this unmitigated disaster,

239
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,130
先生。米切爾？
Mr. Mitchell?

240
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,740
先生。 hadden-
Mr. Hadden-

241
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:00,040
你擔保的真實性，你發表了偽造。
You vouched for the authenticity and you delivered a forgery.

242
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,950
先生。哈登，我真的很抱歉，但我的老本行。
Mr. Hadden, I'm really sorry but in my line of work

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,420
人有一種傾向，說謊。
people have a tendency to lie.

244
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,020
是這樣的，先生。米切爾？
Is that so, Mr. Mitchell?

245
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,520
我本來打算由您的聯繫人所提供的資料，先生。
I was going on information supplied by your contacts, sir.

246
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,150
是的，你應該審核這些信息，對嗎？
Yes, and you were supposed to vet this information, am I correct?

247
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,850
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

248
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,760
你可能已經和審訊的第一章。
You could have gone and interrogated the chap

249
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,800
誰給你的，但是這將是太困難的，
who gave it to you, but that would have been too difficult,

250
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,230
不是嗎？
wouldn't it?

251
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,130
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

252
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,180
每個人都會犯錯。
Everybody makes mistakes.

253
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,950
謝謝你，哈登先生。
Thank you, Mr. Hadden.

254
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,350
永遠不要犯同一個錯誤。
Don't ever make another one.

255
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,650
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

256
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,790
去找真正的頭骨。
Go and get the real skull.

257
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,690
和他一起去。
Go with him.

258
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,430
沒多少時間了。
There isn't a lot of time.

259
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,710
我想這死了的兩個男人的家庭。
I want the families of those two men who died

260
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,540
得到妥善照顧。
taken care of.

261
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

262
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,880
一個奇怪的電子干擾。
A strange electrical disturbance

263
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,480
昨晚震動了奧地利維也納。
rocked Vienna, Austria last night

264
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,990
與停電。
with power outages...

265
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,990
市中心有一次大爆炸。
...There was a large blast in the centre of the city...

266
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,820
目前，駐法國的北約部隊。
...Coming in now, the French NATO troops

267
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
處於高度戒備狀態。
high alert following...

268
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,430
BMP
...BMP...

269
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,050
任一個城市或政府官員的任何單詞。
...Any word from city or government officials...

270
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,700
對此拒絕置評。
...Have refused to comment on this...

271
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,200
政府官員是什麼造成了這種。
...Government officials on what has caused this...

272
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,540
引爆原子武器。
...Detonation of an atomic weapon...

273
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,040
似乎是一個高調的會議。
...What seems to be a high-profile meeting

274
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,300
與總統。
with the president...

275
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,240
我是梅拉妮·考克斯，維也納在線，和我們呆在一起。
I'm Melanie Cox, live from Vienna, stay with us.

276
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
哇。
Wow.

277
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
酷。
Cool.

278
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,620
小心你碰的，它會殺了你。
Be careful what you touch, things could be booby-trapped.

279
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,540
對不起，兄弟。
Sorry, bro.

280
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,960
這是爸爸的戒指。
It's dad's ring.

281
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,290
你是對的。
You were right.

282
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
不，不，不要去碰它！
No, no, don't touch it!

283
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,040
什麼也我只是告訴你嗎？
What did I just tell you?

284
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,660
我沒有碰任何東西！
I didn't touch anything!

285
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,370
對不起，對不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

286
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,670
讓我們在這裏了！
Let's get out of here!

287
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,980
去！
Go!

288
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,250
快點，約翰！
Hurry, John!

289
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,700
好的，來吧。
Ok, come on.

290
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,110
夾在。
Clip in.

291
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,610
你呢？
You in?

292
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,320
- 所有設置。- 確定。
- All set. - Ok.

293
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
遙控器。
Remote.

294
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,630
鬆弛超出。
Slack is out.

295
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
來吧。
Come on.

296
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
怎麼了？
What's wrong?

297
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,970
它不工作。
It's not working.

298
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,170
沒有。
No.

299
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,440
給我你的，我們會一起去。
Give me yours, we'll go together.

300
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,570
夾在。
Clip in.

301
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,770
來吧，來吧！
Come on, come on!

302
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
對不起。
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
在那裏，你在做什麼？
What're you doing??

304
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,380
特裏！
Terry!

305
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,920
對不起，哥哥。
I'm sorry, brother.

306
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,390
我們能做到這一點起來，加油！
We can do this together, come on!

307
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,860
特裏，不這樣做！
Terry, don't do this!

308
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,360
這是唯一的辦法。
It's the only way.

309
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,520
對不起。
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
特裏！
Terry!

311
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,030
我愛你，男人。
I love you, man.

312
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,540
特裏！
Terry!!

313
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,830
我哥哥總是陪伴著我。
My brother always stood by me

314
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,370
儘管他並不總是相信。
even though he didn't always believe in

315
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,700
我在做什麼。
what I was doing.

316
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,500
我想這就是我會最想念他的。
I guess that's what I'll miss most about him.

317
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,150
LUH 。
Luh...

318
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,460
我要感謝大家的光臨今天。
I want to thank everybody for coming today

319
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
和你付尊重。
and paying your respects.

320
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,600
這將意味著很多我的兄弟。
It would mean a lot to my brother.

321
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,620
謝謝。
Thank you.

322
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,730
媽媽，我想念我的爸爸。
Mommy, I miss my daddy.

323
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,910
我知道你想念你的爸爸，親愛的。
I know you miss your daddy, sweetie.

324
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,480
我想念你的爸爸，太。
I miss your daddy, too.

325
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,680
如果有什麼以往任何時候都需要，
And if there's anything ever that you need,

326
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,450
你問你的叔叔約翰，好不好？
you ask your Uncle John, ok?

327
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,620
好吧，叔叔約翰。
Ok, Uncle John.

328
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,790
我猜它運行在家庭。
I guess it runs in the family.

329
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,620
那是什麼？
What's that?

330
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,540
沒有身體，沒有棺材。
No body, no casket.

331
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,600
勞拉，我很抱歉。
Laura, I'm so sorry.

332
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,640
我。
I...

333
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,180
這不是你的錯。
It wasn't your fault.

334
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,150
他是我的小兄弟。
He was my little brother.

335
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,550
我應該保護他。他沒有跟我。
I should have protected him. He didn't have to come with me.

336
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,280
他抬頭看向你。
He looked up to you.

337
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,220
他會跟著你的任何地方。
He would have followed you anywhere.

338
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,010
- 溫斯頓教授？ - 不是現在，拜託。
- Professor Winston? - Not now, please.

339
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,750
- 你好，教授溫斯頓。 - 女士。
- Hello, Professor Winston. - Ladies.

340
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,320
你介意告訴我這是什麼？
Do you mind telling me what this is?

341
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,060
它像什麼？
What's it look like?

342
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,270
它看起來像我的課被取消了。
It looks like my classes have been cancelled.

343
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,830
這就是它說，是的。
That is what it says, yes.

344
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,730
你會關心澄清？
Would you care to elucidate?

345
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,870
我不明白為什麼。
I don't understand why.

346
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,470
我想你的兄弟去世後。
I thought after your brother's death

347
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,540
你可能需要一些時間。
you might want some time.

348
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,170
嗯。
Hmm.

349
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,510
不，我不需要時間。
No, I don't need time.

350
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,810
我只是需要找回我的教學。
I just need to get back to my teaching.

351
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,120
它不是想像中的那麼容易，約翰。
It isn't quite that easy, John.

352
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,620
你是部門負責人，格裏。
You're the head of the department, Gerry.

353
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,930
你為什麼不只是讓那麼容易嗎？
Why don't you just make it that easy?

354
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,190
我是誰必須回答的部門負責人。
I'm the head of the department who must answer

355
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,530
該學院的院長，
to the president of the college,

356
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,690
誰又將有回答董事會。
who in turn has to answer to the board of trustees.

357
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,000
又哪裏受托人必須做任何這樣？
And what do the trustees have to do with any of this?

358
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,330
你是誰告訴這些孩子之一。
You're the one who told these kids

359
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,870
一些神離棄水晶頭骨的故事。
about some god forsaken crystal skull story.

360
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,640
傑拉德，你現在跟我開玩笑吧？
Gerald, are you kidding me now?

361
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,540
它只是一個理論。
It's just a theory.

362
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,670
你和我都知道，。
You and I both know that.

363
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,440
這是正確的，理論。
That's right, a theory.

364
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,480
這不正是我們試圖在這裏做？
Isn't that what we're trying to do here?

365
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,610
幫助孩子為自己著想？
To help kids think for themselves?

366
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,120
學校最大的捐助者之一反對。
One of the school's largest donors objected.

367
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,450
我的雙手被縛。
My hands are tied.

368
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,760
所以現在的捐助者決定的課程？
So now donors dictate curriculum?

369
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,870
他們要拉資金，約翰。
They were going to pull the funding, John.

370
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,430
所有的資金。
All the funding.

371
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,670
我們談論50教師職位。
We're talking fifty faculty jobs.

372
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,700
好吧，好吧。
Ok, alright.

373
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,470
告訴我是誰。
Tell me who it is.

374
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,110
我會告訴他們，也許我可以說服他們，如─
I'll talk to them, maybe I can convince them, if-

375
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,570
沒有，有沒有說服他們。
No, there's no convincing them.

376
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,870
他們的想法是由。
Their minds are made up.

377
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,180
你是一個世界級的考古學家約翰，
You're a world class archaeologist, John,

378
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,910
和罰款的學術。
and a fine academic.

379
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,620
你必須知道，這樣的事情。
You had to know that something like this

380
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,780
會趕上你遲早。
would catch up with you sooner or later.

381
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,020
約翰。我真的很遺憾。
John. I am truly sorry about this.

382
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,390
我也是。
Me too.

383
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,410
他一直在那裏很長一段時間。
He's been in there a long time.

384
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,620
給它一個幾分鐘。
Give it a few more minutes.

385
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,620
又過了幾分鐘，我們將有一個血淋淋的大腿舞。
A few more minutes and he'll have a bloody lap dance.

386
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,290
好吧，這就是它。
Alright, that's it.

387
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,060
離開它的任何時間更長，他將絕對砸了。
Leave it any longer and he's going to be absolutely smashed.

388
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,200
看到光明的一面。你可以隨身攜帶他出去。
Look on the bright side. You can carry him out.

389
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,740
我不會讓他扔了我的新衣服。
I'm not going to have him throw up on my brand new suit.

390
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
來吧。
Come on.

391
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,460
如果你有一支筆，我就簽給你。
If you've got a pen, I'll sign it for you.

392
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,440
如果你是幸運的，哪天它會是值得的東西。
If you're lucky, some day it'll be worth something.

393
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,510
實際上，你的僱主非常感興趣。
Actually, our employer is very interested

394
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,900
與您討論吧。
in discussing it with you.

395
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,070
好吧，
Alright,

396
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,520
什麼是他或她的名字？我會做出來給他 -
what is his or her name? I will make it out to he or she-

397
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,520
威廉·哈登。
William Hadden.

398
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,350
H-A-D-D-E-N 。
H-A-D-D-E-N.

399
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,800
威廉·哈登？
William Hadden?

400
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,330
非常富有的技術傢伙？
The very wealthy technology fellow?

401
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,440
是啊，這會是一個。
Yeah, that'd be the one.

402
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,500
現在什麼，他想與我的書？
Now what would he want with my book?

403
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,840
不是你的書，隊友。
Not your book, mate.

404
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
你。
You.

405
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,170
我呢？
Me?

406
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,620
讓我們只說對他有很深的那一刻，
Let's just say for the moment that he has a very deep,

407
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,150
個人興趣在題材。
personal interest in the subject matter.

408
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,060
好了，也許你應該告訴先生。哈登。
Well, perhaps you should tell Mr. Hadden

409
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,530
他是稍微誤導。
that he's slightly misguided.

410
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,300
水晶頭骨是一個理論。
Crystal skulls are a theory.

411
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,200
顯然不是一個非常好的。
Apparently not a very good one.

412
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,040
哦，我的'。
Oh s my'

413
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,330
那麼，如果我們告訴你。
Well, what if we told you

414
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,410
這是一個有點不僅僅是一個理論。
it was a little more than just a theory.

415
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,670
我想說的是，你們需要再喝一杯。
I'd say that you guys need another drink.

416
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,410
並通過你們我的意思是我。
And by "you guys" I mean me.

417
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,610
請。
Please.

418
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,650
這是我。
It's me.

419
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,900
是的，他們都在裏面，現在。
Yes, they are inside now.

420
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,460
我明白我的使命。
I understand my mission.

421
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,640
他們不會獲得第十三頭骨。
They will not acquire the thirteenth skull.

422
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,780
這聽起來像你要我作出聲明。
It sounds like you want me to make a statement.

423
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,410
精。
Fine.

424
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,610
它將被處理這樣。
It will be handled that way.

425
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,940
所以我想你不會要我簽書？
So I take it you don't want me to sign the book?

426
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,470
先生。哈登願意陪我們到維也納。
Mr. Hadden would like you to accompany us to Vienna.

427
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,880
他想和你談談本人對頭骨。
He would like to talk to you in person about the skulls.

428
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
維也納聽起來可愛。
Vienna sounds lovely.

429
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,190
但不幸的是我有一些同學，
But unfortunately I've got some students,

430
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,820
講座參加到。
lectures to attend to.

431
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,090
真的嗎？
Really?

432
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,160
因為我們聽說你已經被賦予了休假。
Because we heard you've been given a sabbatical

433
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,560
從你的教學義務。
from your teaching obligations.

434
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,830
哦，你聽說過嗎？
Oh, you heard about that?

435
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,200
先生。哈登是一個減輕你。
Mr. Hadden was the one that relieved you

436
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,670
這些義務。
of those obligations.

437
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
現在，他為什麼還要那樣做？
Now why would he want to do that?

438
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,440
他有更大的魚魚苗，不是嗎？
He's got bigger fish to fry, no?

439
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,300
他要你來維也納。
He wants you to come to Vienna

440
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,500
討論你和你父親的一生的工作。
to discuss you and your father's life's work.

441
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,570
他認為這將是更好，如果他有你的。
He thought it would be better if he had your

442
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,580
讓他出來！
Get him out!

443
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,620
上樓梯！去！
Up the stairs! Go!!!!

444
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,730
誰是這傢伙，為什麼他在你拍攝的？
Who was that guy and why was he shooting at you?

445
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,310
他沒有拍攝我，他瞄準了你！
He wasn't shooting at me, he was aiming for you!

446
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,530
他是什麼？
He was what?

447
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,640
第十三頭骨仍然在那裏。
The thirteenth skull is still out there

448
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,740
還有人誰願意做任何事情來阻止它。
and there are people who would do anything to stop it

449
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,900
從被發現。
from being found.

450
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,470
包括像那傢伙的狂熱分子。
Including fanatics like that guy.

451
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,180
那麼，如果哈登希望我一心一意，
Well if Hadden wanted my undivided attention,

452
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,820
他肯定現在有吧。
he certainly has it now.

453
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,580
走，走！
Go, go!

454
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,110
我想在維也納脈衝更新。
I want updates on the Vienna pulse.

455
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,840
還是有電磁信號。
There's still an electro-magnetic signal

456
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,640
從位置，先生正在生成。
being generated from the location, sir.

457
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,940
什麼是源？
What's the source?

458
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,210
沒有辦法告訴沒有，先生。
No way to tell yet, sir.

459
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,280
信號強度保持穩定，
Signal strength is holding steady,

460
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,610
散熱的跡象。
no signs of dissipating.

461
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,750
所以他們仍然能夠產生另一個脈衝的？
So they're still capable of generating another pulse?

462
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
是的，上校。
Yes, colonel.

463
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
如果第二個越強，
If the second one is stronger,

464
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,160
他們可以歐洲黑掉一半。
they could black out half of Europe.

465
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,360
在維也納地上通知地方當局。
Notify local authorities on the ground in Vienna.

466
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,860
我想組裝在15分鐘內上墊一個圍棋隊。
And I want a go team assembled in 15 minutes on the pad.

467
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,140
需要多少時間？
How much longer?

468
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,450
我們降落在希思羅機場，然後我們會在菜刀。
We land at Heathrow, and then we're going on a chopper

469
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,740
在最後一站到維也納。
for the final leg to Vienna.

470
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
菜刀？
A chopper?

471
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,950
我還挺喜歡的噴氣。
I kinda like the jet.

472
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,690
在EMP一陣幾乎降至每架飛機從天空。
The EMP burst nearly dropped every plane from the sky

473
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,550
維也納左右，所以，為了我們自己的保護，
around Vienna, so, for our own protection,

474
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,790
我們切換到旅遊的一種形式。
we're switching to a form of travel

475
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,160
這是有點不太岌岌可危。
that's a little less precarious.

476
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,260
少岌岌可危？
A little less precarious?

477
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,820
放下你的武器！
Lower your weapons!

478
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,800
把'時間了！現在！
Put 'em down! Now!

479
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,490
去左邊。
Go to the left.

480
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,230
感動！
Move!

481
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,640
你休息的人，對我。
The rest of you men, on me.

482
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,090
這是遠遠不夠的，上校。
That's far enough, Colonel.

483
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,880
命令你的手下，放下他們的武器。
Order your men to lower their weapons.

484
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,420
放下你的武器，先生。
You lower your weapons, sir.

485
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,820
這是一種私有財產，因此。
This is a private property and therefore

486
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,950
你無權進入該設施。
you have no authority to enter this facility.

487
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,250
真的嗎？
Really?

488
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,580
我是美國陸軍指揮北約部隊。
I'm the United States Army commanding NATO forces.

489
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,260
我已經得到了權威的該死的空襲打電話。
I've got the authority to call in a damn air strike

490
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,930
在這棟樓，如果我想。
on this building if I wanted to.

491
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,700
你真的想要走這條道路？
You really want to go down that road?

492
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,680
你洛迪克，兒子。
You're out-gunned, son.

493
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,910
告訴你的導師把他們的武器下來。
Tell your men to put their weapons down

494
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,950
沒有人會受到傷害。
and no one gets hurt

495
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,450
好吧。
Alright.

496
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,560
因此，誰負責這個設施的？
So, who's in charge of this facility?

497
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,300
這將是我。
That would be me.

498
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,510
上校貝利，我承擔？
Colonel Bailey, I assume?

499
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,610
我很害怕，先生，
I'm afraid, sir,

500
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,830
有將是指令的變化。
that there's going to be a change of command.

501
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,570
這是一個私人研究機構。
This is a private research facility

502
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,310
由哈登企業全資，
wholly owned by Hadden Enterprises,

503
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,280
這是我所全資擁有的私人公司，。
which is a private company wholly owned by me.

504
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,750
它是什麼，先生。哈登，
What it is, Mr. Hadden,

505
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,550
是未經授權的電磁脈衝的部位。
is the site of an unauthorized electro-magnetic pulse.

506
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,320
我對北約授權。
I'm authorized by NATO

507
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,520
抓住這一獨資設施的控制。
to seize control of this wholly owned facility

508
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,160
直到我知道這到底是發生在這裏。
until I know what the hell is happening here.

509
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,360
我將提出正式投訴與歐盟。
I will be filing a formal complaint with the EU.

510
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,070
你這樣做，先生。
You do that, sir.

511
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,470
直到我聽到，否則，先生。哈登，
Until I hear otherwise, Mr. Hadden,

512
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,930
有一個在城裏有一個新警長。
there's a new sheriff in town.

513
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,150
所以這是最好的一個億萬富翁。
So this is the best a billionaire

514
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,810
能想出，是吧？
could come up with, huh?

515
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,950
一個古老的軍事風格的直升機？
An old military-style helicopter?

516
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,590
它們具有少得多的電子，這使得它們更安全飛行。
They have far less electronics, which makes them safer to fly

517
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
當你有問題，EMP 。
when you have problems with EMP.

518
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,470
這是非常令人欣慰。
That's very comforting.

519
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,340
西耶娜，我想知道。
Sienna, I was wondering...

520
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,030
什麼是霍頓的癡迷與水晶頭骨？
what's Hadden's obsession with the crystal skulls?

521
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,100
你要問他關於那個。
You need to ask him about that.

522
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,310
如果我有機會，我會。
If I get a chance, I will.

523
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,590
我們已經分手的消息在這裏。
We have breaking news here.

524
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,550
它剛剛被證實，所述電。
It has just been confirmed that the electrical

525
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,150
騷亂導致近停電。
disturbance that caused recent power outages

526
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,850
在西歐那樣，其實中心。
across western Europe did in fact center

527
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,620
從哈登行業研究機構。
from Hadden Industries research facilities...

528
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,190
。你可能還記得，哈登行業的老闆。
...As you may remember, the owner of Hadden Industries

529
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,670
是億萬富翁，威廉二世。哈登，
is billionaire, William S. Hadden,

530
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,900
一個人誰最近震驚華爾街。
a man who recently shocked Wall Street

531
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,840
當他決定賣掉他的所有美國利益的。
when he decided to sell all of his US interests

532
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,130
追求歐洲項目。
to pursue European projects...

533
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,510
。你可能還記得，隱藏的工具是一樣的設施。
...As you may recall, the Hadden facility is the same facility

534
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,550
與EMP爆炸了塗黑有關。
associated with the EMP blast that blacked out

535
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,170
大多數西歐。
most of western Europe.

536
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,580
我們正在等待一份官方聲明和評論。
We are awaiting an official statement and comments

537
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,480
從哈登的代表，
from Hadden representatives,

538
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,080
鑒於事件的性質，
given the nature of the incident,

539
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,990
上究竟發生了什麼。
on what exactly happened.

540
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
這是怎麼回事？
What's going on?

541
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
磁場生長。
The magnetic field is growing.

542
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,350
比前一個更快？
Faster than the last one?

543
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,490
指數。
Exponentially.

544
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,470
到底是什麼呢？
What the hell is this?

545
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,400
還有，我們可以做些什麼來控制反應沒有。
There's nothing we can do to control the reaction.

546
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,630
它打破。
It's breaking away.

547
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,430
可有人請解釋什麼，我在看什麼？
Can someone please explain what I am looking at?

548
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,740
這些來自世界各地聚集12水晶頭骨，
These are twelve crystal skulls gathered from around the world,

549
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,480
彙集首次。
brought together for the first time.

550
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,680
在神的名字是什麼，你說什麼？
What in God's name are you talking about?

551
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,520
我告訴你，那裏將是另一個。
I'm telling you that there's going to be another

552
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,610
電磁脈衝，比第1大。
electro-magnetic pulse, larger than the first one.

553
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,450
這些水晶頭骨產生的？
Generated by these crystal skulls?

554
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,580
是的。
Yes.

555
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,460
並沒有什麼我們可以做些什麼來阻止它。
And there isn't anything we can do to stop it.

556
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,830
嗯，我要去停止它。
Well I'm going to stop it.

557
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,630
武器自由，摧毀頭骨。
Weapons free, destroy the skulls.

558
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,900
上校，沒有。
Colonel, no.

559
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
上校，拜託了！
Colonel, please!

560
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,030
你不知道你在做什麼！
You have no idea what you're doing!

561
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,770
火！
Fire!

562
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,760
啊！ ！
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

563
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
這到底是什麼？
What the hell was that?

564
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,900
某種電子脈衝油炸我們。
Some kind of electronic pulse fried us.

565
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,500
我認為，這個老菜刀保護呢？
I thought that this old chopper was protected from that?

566
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,340
導航系統有保護，
Navigation systems have protection,

567
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,040
但燃油泵，去年進行了更新。
but the fuel pumps were updated last year.

568
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,780
你沒有想到，當我們需要一把菜刀。
And you didn't think, that when we needed a chopper

569
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,820
與預售電子，即可能是一個問題？
with pre-sold electronics, that that might be an issue?

570
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
我們有沒有權力？
We've got no power?

571
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:43,690
我們在直升機。
We're in a helicopter.

572
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,350
我們將要墜落，像一塊石頭從天上。
We're going to fall like a stone from the sky.

573
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,960
不，不，不。
No, no, no.

574
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,460
我們可以自動旋轉。
We can auto-rotate.

575
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,390
自動什麼？
Auto-what?

576
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,430
菜刀就像飛機。
Choppers are just like planes.

577
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,460
在上面的行為一樣，除了一個巨大的機翼的鋸片。
The blade on the top acts like a giant wing except

578
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,800
我們必須開始跳水，使這項工作，
we've got to start diving to make this work,

579
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,300
這是一個非常糟糕的地方，自動旋轉和土地。
and this is a really bad place to auto-rotate and land.

580
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,400
我們需要重新路由的電源，燃油泵。
We'll need to re-route the power to the fuel pump.

581
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,240
以及如何地獄我們要做到這一點？ ！
Well how the hell are we going to do that?!

582
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,190
好了，我們可以想辦法回到那裏。
Well, we can figure something out back there.

583
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,510
你知道如何做到這一點？
You know how to do this?

584
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,540
我們要找出其中的燃油泵。
We have to figure out where the fuel pump is.

585
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,650
多久，我們得到了，直到我們必須把這個東西了嗎？
How long have we got until we have to put this thing down?

586
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,220
以這樣的速度的下降，也許另一個兩分鐘，
At this rate of descent, maybe another two minutes,

587
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,480
但我們將不得不硬著陸。
but we're going to have a hard landing

588
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,960
在山的一側。
in the side of a mountain.

589
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,450
我發現了一個精靈。
I found a genie.

590
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,620
電力電纜。
Power cables.

591
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,360
我發現他們在這裏。
I found them right here.

592
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,590
燃油泵是在那裏。
Fuel pumps are up there.

593
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,960
把它放到這了這裏，看。
Put it into this up here, look.

594
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,220
這些燃料線在這裏？
These are the fuel lines here?

595
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
是啊。
Yeah.

596
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,680
我們不會以清除山脈！
We're not going to clear the mountain range!

597
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,470
我的工作是讓這兩個人回來，
My job is to get these two people back,

598
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,700
我們不拋棄！
we're not ditching!

599
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,630
得到它了？
Got it?

600
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,980
我們已經得到了發動機的動力又回來了！
We've got engine power back!

601
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,090
是的，不錯！
Yes, nice!

602
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,880
這是真棒！
That's awesome!

603
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,750
出色的工作，教授，優秀的！
Excellent work, professor, excellent!

604
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,980
我覺得他醒來。
I think he's waking up.

605
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,150
不錯的工作，你救貧混蛋。
Nice job, you save the poor bastard

606
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,590
我們得到的菜刀起來！
and we get the chopper up!

607
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,830
差不太多，如果我這樣說我自己！
Not too bad, if I say so myself!

608
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,740
不，不，不，不！
No, no, no, no!

609
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,430
哦，這只是輝煌，血腥的輝煌！
Oh, that's just brilliant, bloody brilliant!

610
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,270
無氣！
No gas!

611
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,070
你不裝燃油發電機？
You loaded a generator with no fuel?

612
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,740
對不起，先生。
Sorry, sir.

613
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,040
我閉嘴！
Just shut up!

614
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,210
我需要你-
I need you--

615
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,010
我要感謝你邀請我這個小小的冒險。
I want to thank you for inviting me on this little adventure.

616
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:45,700
Professor-
Professor--

617
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,470
移動。動，動了！ ！
Move. move, move!!!!!

618
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,890
你還好嗎？
You alright?

619
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,560
這是一個很好的方式，在歐洲到達。
That was a nice way to arrive in Europe.

620
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,190
是啊，你別客氣，教授。
Yeah, you're welcome, Professor.

621
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,130
現在我們已經找到交通工具前往維也納。
Now we've got to find transport to Vienna.

622
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,810
什麼是地獄剛剛發生了什麼？
What the hell just happened?

623
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,610
你試圖消滅他們。
You attempted to destroy them.

624
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,310
有沒有辦法將其刪除或銷毀。
There is no way to remove them or destroy them.

625
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,060
你現在明白了，上校？
Do you now understand that, Colonel?

626
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,530
我們仍然在線，先生。哈登。
We're still online, Mr. Hadden.

627
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,990
檢查冗余系統。
Check redundant systems.

628
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
先生，
Sir,

629
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,670
我是從直升機上接收信號。
I'm receiving a signal from the helicopter

630
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,070
運送醫生馬洛裏和溫斯頓。
transporting doctors Mallory and Winston.

631
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,330
什麼樣的信號？
What kind of signal?

632
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,630
緊急燈塔。
An emergency beacon.

633
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,100
菜刀下跌。
The chopper is down.

634
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,470
是否有任何傷亡？
Are there any casualties?

635
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,170
任何傷害？
Any injuries?

636
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:56,940
不知道，先生。
Don't know, sir.

637
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
該死！
Dammit!

638
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,150
他們一定的權利，通過脈衝飛行。
They must have flown right through the pulse.

639
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,920
坐上了失事地點的位置。
Get a location on the crash site.

640
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:02,620
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

641
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,190
誰是這個菜刀？
Who was on this chopper?

642
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,380
西耶娜·馬洛裏，我的高級研究員，
Sienna Mallory, my senior researcher,

643
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,260
和約翰·溫斯頓。
and John Winston.

644
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,260
溫斯頓？教授約翰·溫斯頓？
Winston? Professor John Winston?

645
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,560
是的，上校。
Yes, Colonel.

646
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,160
他可能只是誰也阻止不了這個唯一一個。
He might just be the only one who can stop this.

647
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,460
但目前我只關注。
But presently my only concern

648
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,260
是懷念馬洛裏的幸福。
is for Miss Mallory's well-being.

649
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,810
我只是失去了四名士兵，先生。哈登。
I just lost four soldiers, Mr. Hadden.

650
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,340
我不是特別關心你的個人decadences 。
I'm not particularly concerned with your personal decadences.

651
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,620
西耶娜·馬洛裏是我的女兒，上校。
Sienna Mallory is my daughter, Colonel.

652
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,080
所以請，
So please,

653
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,860
使用你有什麼資源，在您的處置。
use whatever resources you have at your disposal

654
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,550
並讓他們在這裏盡快。
and get them here as soon as possible.

655
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,690
給我的男人的坐標，我會送回收隊伍。
Give my men those coordinates and I'll send a recovery team.

656
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,850
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

657
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,790
先生。哈登，對不起。
Mr. Hadden, I'm sorry.

658
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,640
我是一個父親，以及。
I'm a father as well.

659
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,060
謝謝你，上校。
Thank you, Colonel.

660
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,400
道歉接受。
Apology accepted.

661
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,970
上校！你必須看到這個！
Colonel! You have to see this!

662
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,920
我剛在柏林的地方八國集團成員。
I've just arrived here in Berlin where members of the G8

663
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,480
現在收集了什麼似乎是一個緊急會議。
are now gathering for what seems to be an emergency meeting

664
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,220
對於這些奇怪的天氣現象。
regarding these strange weather phenomena

665
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,830
這似乎增加了每小時。
which seem to be increasing by the hour.

666
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,460
這樣的天氣phenomenahas現在已經達到臨界質量。
This weather phenomena has now reached critical mass

667
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,130
你可以看到，它現在已經成為一個巨大的漩渦！
as you can see, it's now become a massive vortex!

668
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,030
我剛剛收到突發新聞，軍事單位。
I've just received breaking news that the military units

669
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,510
現在已經轉移到城市，以協助疏散。
have now been moved into the city to assist with evacuation.

670
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,370
現在報道說。
Now reports say

671
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,180
一個閃電風暴兩倍大小。
that a lightening storm has tripled in size

672
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,410
在過去的24小時，
over the last 24 hours,

673
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,140
和巨漩渦現在席捲全市。
and that the giant vortex is now engulfing the city.

674
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,780
但隨著漩渦越飄過歐洲，
But as the vortex drifts farther across Europe,

675
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,220
我認為每個人的嘴唇問題是。
I think the question on everybody's lips is

676
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,660
我們在哪裏避難？
where do we evacuate to?

677
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,620
這是什麼？
What is this?

678
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,860
如果我是對的，這是結束的開始。
If I'm right, it's the beginning of the end.

679
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,260
不要採取這種錯誤的方式，
Don't take this the wrong way,

680
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,000
但我希望上帝你錯了。
but I hope to God you're wrong.

681
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,350
先生。哈登，我們別無選擇。
Mr. Hadden, we have no choice.

682
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,710
我們必須遏制實驗室和破壞頭骨。
We have to contain the lab and destroy the skulls.

683
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,550
那是不可能的，上校。
That is impossible, Colonel.

684
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,010
我們不能坐在這裏什麼都不做！
We can't just sit here and do nothing!

685
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
爸爸！
Daddy!

686
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,050
我以為我已經失去了你！
I thought I had lost you!

687
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,030
教授約翰·溫斯頓，
Professor John Winston,

688
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,690
我想你見見威廉·哈登。
I'd like you to meet William Hadden.

689
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:03,490
我的父親。
My father.

690
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
先生。哈登。
Mr. Hadden.

691
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,630
教授，我是你的父親是一個偉大的崇拜者，
Professor, I was a great admirer of your father's,

692
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,870
因為我是你自己。
as I am of you yourself.

693
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,700
這是上校貝利。
This is Colonel Bailey.

694
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,470
貝利。
Bailey.

695
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,370
教授。
Professor.

696
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,480
我很欣賞的客氣話，
I appreciate the kind words,

697
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,340
我不符合我的父親很多球迷。
I don't meet many fans of my father's

698
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,520
除了邊緣群體和狂人。
except for fringe groups and lunatics.

699
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,710
好了，我希望我沒有。
Well, I hope I'm neither.

700
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,350
之前，我失去了我的腿腳，
Before I lost my ability to walk,

701
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,550
這是在那裏我做了我最好的思想。
it was where I did my best thinking.

702
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,350
所以，如果你不介意的話，我們應該一起走？
So, if you don't mind, shall we walk together?

703
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,820
我不介意，如果你不介意的話解釋給我。
I don't mind at all, if you don't mind explaining to me

704
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,960
它究竟是什麼，我在這裏做。
what exactly it is that I'm doing here.

705
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,800
我是一個非常富有的人，醫生溫斯頓。
I'm a very wealthy man, Doctor Winston.

706
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,860
我一直在為我一生中最。
I have been for most of my life.

707
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,130
但是，我擔心我的傲慢已經得到了我的好。
But, I fear my hubris has gotten the better of me

708
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,300
在目前所發生的事情光。
in the light of what is now happening.

709
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,510
我會把它作為簡單的，我可以。
I'll put this as simply as I can.

710
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:56,490
你在這裏，醫生溫斯頓，因為我快死。
You're here, Doctor Winston, because I am dying.

711
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,230
我一直在與癌癥作鬥爭了十年。
I have been fighting cancer for ten years.

712
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,540
在我的追求治癒的，
In my pursuit of a cure,

713
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,070
我才知道水晶頭骨。
I became aware of the crystal skulls

714
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,870
並開始收購這些。
and began to acquire them.

715
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,100
所有的人，但第十三。
All of them but the thirteenth.

716
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
是的。
Yes.

717
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,280
第一個被發現在南美洲，
The first were found in South America,

718
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,340
接著是三個其他 -
followed by three others-

719
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,470
原諒我打斷了，先生，
Forgive me for interrupting, sir,

720
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,570
據我所知，歷史上。
I understand the history

721
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,740
但所有的頭骨已被證明是一個欺詐，
but all the skulls have proven to be a fraud,

722
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,920
碳定年測試了他們沒有老。
carbon dating has tested them to be no older

723
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,750
超過200或300年。
than 200 or 300 years.

724
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,950
相信我，我們有我們的失敗。
Trust me, we have had our failures.

725
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,590
沒有一個完美的。
No one's perfect.

726
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,560
讓我們只說測試是有些犯罪嫌疑人。
Let's just say the tests were somewhat suspect.

727
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,620
懷疑？
Suspect?

728
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,630
你在說什麼？
What are you saying?

729
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,470
碳定年是改變以某種方式？
The carbon dating was altered somehow?

730
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,960
你得到了十二種不同的頭骨。
You got the twelve different skulls

731
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,440
來自世界各個不同地區？
from all different pans of the world?

732
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:52,440
哈登行業擁有。
Hadden Industries owns

733
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,670
六個最大的碳年代測定設施。
six of the largest carbon dating facilities.

734
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,740
所以測試是假的？
So the tests were fake?

735
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,510
讓我們只說我們有證據更高的標準。
Let's just say we have a higher standard of proof.

736
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,340
啊，對吧。
Ah, right, right.

737
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,550
你欺騙了整個科學界。
You duped the whole scientific community.

738
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,450
我們所做的是softenthe收購價格。
What we did was soften the purchase price

739
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,350
把他們趕走館內陳列。
to take them off the museum displays.

740
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,620
先生。哈登可以成為億萬富翁，
Mr. Hadden may be a billionaire,

741
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,320
但每個人都有自己的價格。
but everyone has their price.

742
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,620
右，右。
Right, right.

743
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,490
所以它的錢。
So it's about money.

744
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,600
我們談論放在一起。
We're talking about putting together

745
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,760
12世界上最珍貴的對象。
twelve of the most precious objects in the world.

746
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,470
什麼，如果真不會發生。
Something that would not happen if the truth

747
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
成為眾矢之的。
became common knowledge.

748
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,600
先生。哈登，我不知道是什麼含義是。
Mr. Hadden, I don't know what the implications are

749
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,000
你改變這些試驗中，
of you altering these tests,

750
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,240
但我想它涉及監獄。
but I imagine it involves prison.

751
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,040
我要死了，上校。
I am dying, Colonel.

752
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,270
是啊，好了，你還沒死。
Yeah, well, you're not dead yet.

753
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,210
Ok了，堅持住，堅持住，堅持。
Ok, hold on, hold on, hold on.

754
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,610
沒有這個，現在真正重要的。
None of this really matters now.

755
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,550
頭骨是真實的。
The skulls are real.

756
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,590
所以他們多大？
So how old are they?

757
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,460
他們大多是過時大約50萬年前。
Most of them were dated about 500,000 years ago.

758
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,460
別人無法日期。
Others cannot be dated.

759
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,900
50萬年？
500,000 years?

760
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,360
那人早。
That pre-dates man.

761
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,260
這意味著一些其他來源。
Which implies some other origin.

762
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,130
也許是外星人？
Perhaps extraterrestrials?

763
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,300
先生。哈登，我不知道，如果你的碳約會有心計。
Mr. Hadden, I don't know if your carbon dating shenanigans

764
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,500
已導致這場災難，
have lead to this disaster,

765
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,970
但我知道，我還有一個問題。
but I do know that I have another problem.

766
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,410
防止全球的端。
Preventing the end of the world.

767
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,240
你和我有同樣的目標，上校。
You and I have the same goal, Colonel.

768
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:05,970
上校！
Colonel!

769
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,110
夠了！
Enough!

770
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,950
現在，如果你和教授溫斯頓能拿出一個解決方案，
Now if you and Professor Winston can come up with a solution,

771
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,150
我所有的耳朵。
I'm all ears.

772
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,720
但現在我必須賦予北約。
But now I must confer with NATO

773
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,810
並拿出我們自己的方法。
and come up with our own method.

774
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,520
蠻力將無法正常工作！
Brute force will not work!

775
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,490
你所看到的happenedwhen你的人試圖。
You saw what happened when your men attempted

776
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,790
攻擊的頭骨！
to attack the skulls!

777
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,690
他們有一個堅不可摧的領域身邊！
They have an impregnable field around them!

778
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,360
那是四個人。
That was four men.

779
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,730
我說的是一些藥更強。
I'm talking about some stronger medicine.

780
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,600
我們知道強行將不起作用。
We know force won't work.

781
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,030
會是怎樣？
What Will?

782
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,470
第十三頭骨。
The thirteenth skull.

783
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,370
但困境是。
But the dilemma is

784
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,450
我不知道從哪裏開始尋找它。
I have no idea where to begin to look for it.

785
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,950
我想你跟著你父親的腳步。
I want you to follow your father's footsteps

786
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,110
並發現它。
and find it.

787
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,150
滿足你的命運。
Fulfill your destiny.

788
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,150
先生。 hadden-
Mr. Hadden-

789
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,750
我的資源，每一個人。
Every single one of my resources

790
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,360
將在您的處置。
will be at your disposal.

791
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,390
上帝知道我創造了這個災難。
God knows I created this disaster.

792
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,530
如果非要用我的財富每一位來阻止它，
If I have to use every bit of my fortune to stop it,

793
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,620
這樣吧。
so be it.

794
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,540
有一件事，我們沒有一個有很大的。
There's one thing that neither one of us has much of.

795
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,300
而那會是什麼？
And what would that be?

796
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,740
時間。
Time.

797
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,180
所以我該承擔這個菜刀是比上一個更安全？
So am I to assume this chopper is safer than the last one?

798
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,550
這是冷戰技術。
It's Cold War technology.

799
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,590
它的建成能夠承受核爆炸。
It's built to withstand a nuclear explosion.

800
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,290
所以你為什麼不告訴我，哈登是你的父親嗎？
So why didn't you tell me that Hadden was your father?

801
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,960
和破壞的驚喜呢？
And spoil the surprise?

802
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,900
你知道，我們有很多共同點，教授。
You know, we have a lot in common, Professor.

803
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
真的嗎？
Really?

804
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,370
那是什麼？
What's that?

805
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,870
我們倆度過了我們的生活努力走出陰影。
We've both spent our lives trying to get out of the shadow

806
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,070
我們的父輩。
of our fathers.

807
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,950
是什麼馬洛裏是？
Is that what Mallory is?

808
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,610
這是我母親的娘家姓。
It was my mother's maiden name.

809
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,220
她去世時，我是一個小女孩。
She died when I was a little girl.

810
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,230
將它作出了區別，如果你已經知道我是誰嗎？
Would it have made a difference if you had known who I was?

811
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:05,030
什麼，我多麼認真了嗎？
In what, how seriously I took you?

812
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,840
或者多麼誘人我還以為你是當我們第一次見面？
Or how attractive I thought you were when we first met?

813
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
認真？
Seriously?

814
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,910
所以，你呃。
So, do you uh...

815
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,380
一直等到你的直升機拿到一個女孩獨自。
always wait until you get a girl alone in a helicopter

816
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,510
您胸圍之前這樣的行了呢？
before you bust a line like that out?

817
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,710
不，我通常等待，看看是否這個女孩我打的。
No, I usually wait to find out if the girl I'm hitting on

818
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,550
是億萬富翁的女兒。
is the daughter of the billionaire.

819
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,850
哦，肯定。
Oh, sure.

820
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,290
那麼我想這是一個恥辱。
Well then I guess it's a shame

821
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,290
我繼承被關押在生前信託。
that my inheritance is being held in a living trust.

822
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,820
啊。
Ahh.

823
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,100
所以我們要去哪裏？
So where are we going?

824
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,280
你爸爸告訴我，在我父親的後塵。
Your father told me to follow in my father's footsteps.

825
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,510
這就是我在做什麼。
That is what I'm doing.

826
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,480
第十三頭骨是在哪兒？
The thirteenth skull is down there?

827
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,550
不，這是我的父親來到了最後的地方。
No, this is the last place my father came

828
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,270
他消失前。
before he disappeared.

829
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,140
這是唯一的辦法了嗎？
And this is the only way down?

830
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,480
恐怕是。
I'm afraid so.

831
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,390
準備好了嗎？
Ready?

832
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,650
我們在這裏。
We're here.

833
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,660
方便，易於。
Easy, easy.

834
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,260
我得雅。
I've got ya.

835
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,540
這是有趣的。
That's interesting.

836
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,140
什麼？
What?

837
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,580
因為我在這裏與特裏，
Since I was here with Terry,

838
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,080
我發現這個洞穴已經崩潰。
I find that this cave has collapsed.

839
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
非常好？
That's good?

840
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,450
不，如果我們需要另一條出路。
Not if we need another way out.

841
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,860
或者我們可能避免這整個極限運動例行。
Or we could have avoided this entire extreme sports routine.

842
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,690
是的，脂肪的機會。來吧。
Yeah, fat chance. Come on.

843
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,640
你是怎麼得到你父親的筆記本電腦。
How did you get your father's notebook

844
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,510
如果他們從來沒有發現自己的身體？
if they never found his body?

845
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,640
這是送給我在一所大學在那裏我教。
It was sent to me at a college where I was teaching

846
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,410
你的父親在我面前解雇。
before your father had me fired.

847
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,580
OK，很好，沒有解釋是誰發送給你。
Ok, well that doesn't explain who sent it to you.

848
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,780
你不知道？
You don't know?

849
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,260
這是你的父親。
It was your father.

850
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,700
他送出一記隨之。
He sent a note along with it.

851
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,460
他說，他的研究人員的一個發現它。
He said that one of his researchers had found it

852
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,870
遠征，他覺得或許有一天。
on an expedition and he thought perhaps one day

853
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,410
我會覺得有用。
I would find it useful.

854
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,580
所以這是最後的地方你的父親是？
So this was the last place your father was?

855
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,740
這是在那裏他們發現了筆記本電腦？
This is where they found the notebook?

856
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,110
我傾向於同意你的。
I'd be inclined to agree with you.

857
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,750
但如果我父親的研究小組已經在這裏了。
But if my father's research team had already been here

858
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,750
他們沒有找到第十三頭骨，
and they didn't find the thirteenth skull,

859
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,220
我們為什麼在這裏？
why are we here?

860
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,320
持此，請。
Hold this, please.

861
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,790
這是我的父親來到了最後的地方。
This is the last place that my father came.

862
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,630
在我的弟弟失去了他的生活。
Where my brother lost his life.

863
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,430
和我打賭，答案還在這裏。
And I'm betting that the answer is still here.

864
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,540
我們只需要知道去哪裏找吧。
We just have to know where to look for it.

865
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,120
對不起，先生們。
Excuse me, gentlemen.

866
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,550
它是什麼？
What is it?

867
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,390
頭骨都產生了非常集中的磁場。
The skulls are generating a very focused magnetic field

868
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,460
它開始於隔離腔。
which begins in the isolation chamber

869
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,900
並伸出超出公用線。
and extends out beyond the common line.

870
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:06,230
這是分隔地球大氣層行。
That's the line that separates the Earth's atmosphere

871
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,430
來自外太空。
from outer space.

872
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,460
我知道它是什麼。
I know what it is.

873
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:13,530
似乎現在向後延伸到地球的核心。
It seems that it now extends back to the Earth's core.

874
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,740
什麼是地獄做所有的意思是，先生。哈登？
What the hell does all that mean, Mr. Hadden?

875
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,280
這意味著，現在有一個新的領域。
It means that there's now a new field

876
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,610
與現有的1競爭。
competing with the existing one.

877
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,580
好了，所以現在給我一個壞消息。
Alright, so now give me the bad news.

878
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,660
火山與地震活動，
Volcanic and seismic activity,

879
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,500
和良好的可能性，即地球的地殼鐵。
and a good possibility that the Earth's iron crust

880
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,040
會開裂就像一個雞蛋，
will crack like an egg,

881
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:46,740
如果這種情況發生全球將有字面上撕裂。
and if that happens the planet will be literally torn apart

882
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,640
而好消息嗎？
And the good news?

883
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,580
先生。普裏查德。
Mr. Pritchard.

884
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,220
以目前的速度，SAR，大約30小時。
At the current rate, sir, roughly 30 hours.

885
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,350
- 發出疏散令。 - 是的，先生。
- Issue an evacuation order. - Yes, sir.

886
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,520
在30小時，
In 30 hours,

887
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,180
我授權使用的戰術。
I am authorizing the use of a tactical

888
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,390
核武器在這個網站。
nuclear weapon at this site.

889
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,290
我會汽化那些神拋棄的東西。
I'll vaporize those god forsaken things

890
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,030
回到地方是，他們從來到。
back to wherever it is that they came from.

891
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,230
你所看到的所發生的當你的人試圖。
You saw what happened when your men attempted

892
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,060
消滅他們！
to destroy them!

893
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,600
這是四名士兵，先生。哈登。
That was four soldiers, Mr. Hadden.

894
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,430
我說的是力量尚未釋放。
I'm talking about power that hasn't been unleashed

895
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,840
自廣島。
since Hiroshima.

896
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,910
你要成為結束世界的男人。
You are going to be the man who ended the world.

897
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,080
也許它保存。
Or maybe saved it.

898
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:43,990
你還好嗎？
You alright?

899
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,690
嗯
Mmmhmm.

900
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,330
這邊。
This way.

901
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,420
做好。
Good job.

902
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,890
- 你還好嗎？ - 是啊。
- You ok? - Yeah.

903
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,370
約翰？
John?

904
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,640
看。
Look.

905
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,750
約翰，你還好嗎？
John, you ok?

906
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:48,950
是啊。
Yeah.

907
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,720
是啊，我很好。
Yeah, I'm fine.

908
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,090
這是給你的，我的兄弟。
This is for you, my brother.

909
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,540
我們已經準備好提取。
We're ready for the extraction.

910
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,550
繼續。
Go ahead

911
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,120
來吧！
Come on!

912
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,370
我們得離開這個地方！
We've gotta get out of this place!

913
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,070
是的，沒有開玩笑。
Yeah, no kidding.

914
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,300
來吧。
Come on.

915
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,610
我很高興，這是我們後面。
I'm glad that's behind us.

916
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,800
我們不需要這些了。
We don't need these anymore.

917
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,990
好。
Ok.

918
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,470
這裏，讓我幫你。
Here, let me help you.

919
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,940
好了，這邊。
Alright, this way.

920
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,510
我們走 ，來吧。
Let's go, come on.

921
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,820
直升機怎麼了？
What happened to the helicopter?

922
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,940
有人拍下來。
Someone shot it down.

923
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,520
誰？
Who?

924
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,780
我不知道。
I don't know.

925
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:26,020
大概誰開槍我在酒吧同一個人。
Probably the same person who shot at me in the bar.

926
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,420
他們加強它一個或兩個檔次。
They stepped it up a notch or two.

927
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,650
仔細。
Careful.

928
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,500
啊！
Agh!

929
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,350
你在幹什麼？那真痛啊！
What're you doing? That really hurt!

930
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,550
米切爾，你到底在這做什麼？
Mitchell, what the hell are you doing here?

931
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,810
哦，現在來吧。
Oh now come on.

932
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,940
你真的沒有想到先生。哈登。
You didn't really think Mr. Hadden

933
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,010
打算讓你在歐洲中途拖曳。
was going to let you traipse halfway across Europe

934
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,240
他珍愛的小女孩。
with his precious little girl

935
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,450
有沒有人讓你的眼睛，是不是？
with nobody to keep an eye on you, did you?

936
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,050
直升機怎麼了？
What happened to the helicopter?

937
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,200
有人用導彈把它打下來了。
Someone took it down with a missile.

938
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,560
有人似乎有意殺害我。
Someone who seems to be intent on killing me.

939
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,690
你能想到誰？
Do you have any idea who?

940
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,500
宗教狂熱分子，邊緣群體，
Religious fanatics, fringe groups,

941
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,260
- 白人至上主義者，中央情報局。 - 好吧，好吧。
- white supremacists, CIA... - Alright, alright.

942
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,200
你知道，我所知道的是，在我遇見你。
You know, all I know is that before I met you

943
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,780
我不知道，怎麼會有人想要殺我。
I had no idea that anyone would want to kill me.

944
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,310
我是一個十分討人喜歡的那種人。
I'm a likable enough kind of guy.

945
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,710
所以你說。你聽著，
So you say. Now look,

946
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,240
你想站在這兒，談談。
do you want to stand around here and talk about

947
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,680
誰是在你的刺客，
the assassins who are after you,

948
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,010
或者你想獲得地獄離開這裏。
or do you want to get the hell out of here

949
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,380
他們的工作之前，你是不是在菜刀。
before they work out that you weren't in the chopper

950
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,540
他們擊落？
that they shot down?

951
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,480
是啊，這就是我想。
Yeah, that's what I thought.

952
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,310
我想要一個EMP-屏蔽銅纜站在。
I want an EMP-shielded chopper standing by

953
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,530
拉我們其餘的人離開這裏到時候。
to pull the rest of us out of here when the time comes.

954
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,110
是的，長官。
Yes, sir.

955
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,410
他們將在這裏。
They'll be here.

956
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,540
我希望你是對的。
I hope you're right.

957
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,320
每個人的緣故。
For everyone's sake.

958
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,260
因為我不想名垂青史。
Because I don't want to go down in history

959
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,190
因為誰授權的核裝置的引爆的人。
as the man who authorized the detonation of a nuclear device

960
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,550
拯救世界。
to save the world.

961
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,860
那就不要做了，上校。
Then don't do it, Colonel.

962
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,890
這是從我手中。
It's out of my hands.

963
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,510
我們應該把這些燈出來，並殺死加熱器。
We should put these lights out and kill that heater.

964
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,880
它會吸引了錯誤樣的公司，
It could attract the wrong kind of company,

965
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,780
如果你知道我的意思。
if you know what I mean.

966
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,010
是啊，我冷，我們需要光算出這個。
Yeah, well I'm cold, and we need light to figure this out.

967
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,210
好，那你還不如送了一個信號彈。
Well, then you might as well send up a signal flare

968
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,520
並告訴誰是我們後，我們都。
and tell whoever is after us where we are.

969
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,220
也許你應該拿出你吸煙，廉價雪茄。
Maybe you should put out that cheap cigar you're smoking.

970
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,730
氣味會吸引了錯誤的那種人。
The smell will attract the wrong kind of people.

971
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,160
這是一個科伊巴。
It's a Cohiba.

972
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,700
哦，還有完善的。
Oh, well perfect.

973
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,360
在這種情況下，我會只吸引了。
In that case we'll only attract

974
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,490
最好的一種恐怖分子和刺客。
the best kind of terrorists and assassins.

975
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,930
此外，這就是為什麼我們有你在這裏。
Besides, that's why we have you here.

976
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,730
保護我們。
To protect us.

977
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,600
是啊，我不能保護你自己。
Yeah, well I can't protect you from yourselves.

978
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,500
它不是在這裏。
It's not here.

979
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,530
它必須是。
It has to be.

980
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,580
是啊，我還看不出來，我累了。
Yeah, well I can't see it and I'm tired.

981
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:13,520
也許我們應該抓住幾個睡眠時間。
Maybe we should grab a couple of hours of sleep.

982
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,780
重新開始。
Start fresh.

983
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,520
太陽將高達很快。
The sun will be up soon.

984
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,960
但是，如果我們不破解這個也沒什麼關係。
Although, if we don't crack this it won't matter.

985
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,760
如何我們該怎麼離開這裏沒有菜刀，米切爾？
How are we gonna get out of here without a chopper, Mitchell?

986
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,900
我不會把另外一隻小鳥在該地區。
I'm not putting another bird up in the area

987
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,470
直到我們確保它。
until we've secured it.

988
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,500
現在聽，教授。
Now listen, professor.

989
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,610
你需要專注於拯救世界。
You need to concentrate on saving the world.

990
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,900
我需要散散心，所以我能思考。
I need to get some fresh air so I can think.

991
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,380
去給他一隻手。
Go and give him a hand.

992
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,420
你看到了嗎？
You see it?

993
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,490
看什麼？
See what?

994
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,060
有。
There.

995
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,500
有啊！
There it is!

996
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,500
我知道我會找到它。
I knew I would find it.

997
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,640
讓我告訴你它在哪裏。
Let me show you where it is.

998
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,550
有你們兩個想通了？
Have you two figured it out?

999
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,410
是的，也許。
Yeah, maybe.

1000
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,710
我需要報告的時間。哈登和上校。
I need to report to Mr. Hadden and the Colonel

1001
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,550
如果你已經破解這個還是不。
if you've cracked this or not.

1002
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,020
這不是地圖，這是地方。
This is not the map, this is the place.

1003
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,520
這些，這些是地圖。
These, these are the map.

1004
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,720
我不跟著你。
I'm not following you.

1005
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,260
他們是明星。
They're stars.

1006
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,230
此圖顯示的確切位置找到。
This drawing shows us exactly where to find

1007
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,600
第十三頭骨。
the thirteenth skull.

1008
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,710
我還以為你會興奮。
I thought you'd be excited.

1009
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,510
好了，在洞穴寺廟必須是3000多年的歷史。
Well, the temple in that cave must be 3000 years old.

1010
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:44,670
我說更像是5 。
I'd say more like five.

1011
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,040
哦，甚至更好的。
Oh, even better.

1012
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,380
所以我們要做的就是想通了。
So all we have to do is figure out

1013
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,470
其中，該星座出現。
where that constellation appeared

1014
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,480
在夜空中在5000年前？
in the night sky 5000 years ago?

1015
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,610
嗯，這很容易。
Well, that's easy.

1016
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,010
你知道，我知道，為了讓我們兩個。
You know, I realize that in order for the two of us

1017
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,960
弄明白這將需要數月，甚至更長的時間。
to figure it out it would take months, maybe longer.

1018
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,720
但對於你爸的超級計算機之一。
But for one of your dad's super computers

1019
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,490
它應該是小菜一碟。
it should be a piece of cake.

1020
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,650
正確的。
Right.

1021
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,440
好吧，
Alright,

1022
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:21,140
輸入偏角和推斷。
enter the declination and extrapolate.

1023
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,890
哦，等等，我們已經得到的東西。
Oh wait, we've got something.

1024
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,660
你們兩個是作品。
You two are a piece of work.

1025
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,000
對了，你想知道的星座出現。
Right, you wanted to know where that constellation appeared

1026
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,330
在夜空中在5000年前？
in the night sky 5000 years ago?

1027
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:48,310
嗯，其實5302個月11天。
Well, actually 5302 months and 11 days.

1028
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,980
有你的答案。
There's your answer.

1029
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,840
這到底是什麼？
What the hell is that?

1030
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,350
它的維索科山谷，這是理論上的一個金字塔。
It's the Visoko Valley, it's theoretically a pyramid.

1031
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,610
這是我們要去的地方。
That's where we're going.

1032
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:10,330
太陽金字塔

1033
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,330
有趣的是它如何保持未開發。
It's interesting how it has remained unexplored

1034
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:18,600
千百年來。
for thousands of years.

1035
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:22,110
人們認為這是一個自然形成的很長一段時間。
People thought it was a natural formation for a long time.

1036
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,420
哦，我的父親說，軍方把時鐘上我們。
Oh, my father said the military put a clock on us.

1037
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:31,910
我們有六個小時。
We have six hours.

1038
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,510
我希望米切爾世界末日前回來。
I hope Mitchell gets back before the world ends

1039
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,530
和他出去想租一輛車。
and he's out trying to rent a car.

1040
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,380
真的嗎？
Really?

1041
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,490
這是一個有趣的選擇。
That's an interesting choice.

1042
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,640
這是我們的人，這是我們的人！
That's our man, that's our man!

1043
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,690
哦男孩。
Oh boy.

1044
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,710
你為世界上最富有的人工作。
You work for the wealthiest man in the world

1045
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,110
竟然租到最好的車是這樣的？
and the best car you could rent was this?

1046
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:02,080
好了，對不起，王牌先生，但他們沒有用信用卡。
Well, excuse me, Mr. Trump, but they didn't take credit cards

1047
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,280
這是所有我能得到的現金，我不得不。
and this was all I could get with the cash I had.

1048
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,990
好了，讓我們去哪兒？
Well, so where are we going?

1049
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,210
是這樣嗎？
Is that it?

1050
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,400
你到底在期待，米切爾？吉薩？
What were you expecting, Mitchell? Giza?

1051
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,600
好了，我不知道，也許更大的東西比？
Well, I don't know, maybe something bigger than that?

1052
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,660
它只是看起來像一個奇怪形狀的小山。
It just looks like an odd-shaped hill.

1053
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,270
好了，這是一個金字塔。
Well, it is a pyramid.

1054
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,900
是啊，我知道，教授Smarty的褲。
Yeah, well I know that, Professor Smarty-Pants.

1055
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,340
我要說它看起來並不像一個地方。
All I'm saying is it doesn't look like a place

1056
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,180
將持有的關鍵，拯救世界。
that would hold the key to save the world.

1057
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:28,910
我看到。
I see.

1058
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,950
你期望什麼樣子？
And what do you suppose that would look like?

1059
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,320
好了，好了，所以有什麼計劃？
Ok, alright, so what's the plan?

1060
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,880
我們要保持低調，
We're gonna keep a low profile,

1061
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:37,010
遠離村莊，直到天黑，
stay away from the village until it gets dark,

1062
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,550
然後去好和安靜。
and then go in nice and quiet.

1063
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,530
這個計劃聽起來強如在汽車的選擇。
That plan sounds as strong as the choice in cars.

1064
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:45,650
坐進車內。
Get in the car.

1065
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,940
我的天啊，還能再小嗎？
My goodness, could this be smaller?

1066
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,700
哪裏是每個人？
Where is everyone?

1067
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,030
我怎麼會知道？
How should I know?

1068
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,310
一個鎮民大會，脫衣舞俱樂部？
A town meeting, strip club?

1069
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,040
脫衣舞俱樂部？
Strip club?

1070
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,240
這些都是很好的人。
These are nice people.

1071
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,970
你永遠不知道。
You never know.

1072
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,490
村莊都需要一個良好的脫衣舞俱樂部。
Villages all need a good strip club.

1073
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,290
你不早說？
A little early, wouldn't you say?

1074
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,930
好吧，我想我們都知道，每個人都。
Well, I guess we know where everyone is.

1075
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:27,500
我們得出去。
We've got to get out.

1076
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,800
- 這會過去，給它時間。 - 看看你身後。
- This will pass, give it time. - Look behind you.

1077
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,200
哦，拍。
Oh, shoot.

1078
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,300
出去。
Get out.

1079
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,210
只是充當普通。
Just act normal.

1080
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:49,650
不要東張西望。
Don't look around.

1081
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:50,660
還沒有反應過來。
Don't react.

1082
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,800
不要讓他們知道我們被跟蹤。
Don't make it known we're being followed.

1083
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,620
但我們被跟蹤，所以我們怎麼行動？
But we are being followed, so how are we supposed to act?

1084
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,620
休閒。
Casual.

1085
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:57,430
究竟有多少？
How many are there?

1086
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,300
還有我們兩個的後面，兩個在我們面前。
There's two behind us and two in front of us.

1087
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,200
剛轉身打成一片。
Just turn around and mingle.

1088
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,030
好的
QKEY

1089
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:14,380
他們在做什麼？
What are they doing?

1090
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,020
我以前見過你。
I've seen you before.

1091
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,550
是的。
Yes.

1092
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,090
我也見過你。
And I have seen you, as well.

1093
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,560
現在，恐怕這將是我們最後一次見面。
Now, I'm afraid this will be our last meeting.

1094
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:08,400
是，一些委婉的說法，因為你要殺死我們？
Is that some kind of euphemism because you're going to kill us?

1095
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,530
放鬆，西耶娜。
Easy, Sienna.

1096
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:10,830
不對抗的人。
Don't antagonize the man.

1097
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,410
他有一把劍。
He's got a sword.

1098
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,530
是的，這位教授有一個點。
Yeah, the professor has a point.

1099
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:20,880
去，享受你的玩笑，因為它會現在都結束。
Go on, enjoy your banter, because it will all end now.

1100
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,360
它是什麼，你呢？
What is it that you're after?

1101
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,180
你知道我們是後。
You know what we're after.

1102
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,180
你一直跟著我們。
You've been following us.

1103
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,720
是的。
Yes.

1104
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,590
這是我們的工作，保護第13個。
It is ourjob to protect the thirteen.

1105
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,220
頭骨。
Skulls.

1106
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,700
他們擁有不可思議的力量，當他們匯聚。
They possess incredible power when they are brought together.

1107
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,010
一些你父親做了。
Something your father did.

1108
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:50,940
你死之前，我想問問你。
Before you die, I wanted to ask you

1109
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,280
你一旦發現你以為會發生什麼。
what it is you thought would happen once you found that

1110
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,580
你求？
which you seek?

1111
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:58,750
我們需要它阻止
We need to work together in order to stop it.

1112
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,150
阻止什麼？
Stop what?

1113
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,880
你不知道嗎？
Don't you know?

1114
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,620
12頭骨所造成的破壞。
The destruction caused by the twelve skulls

1115
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,820
正在匯聚。
being brought together.

1116
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,800
我們需要第十三阻止它。
We need the thifleenth to stop it.

1117
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:15,300
還有，如果一個人是愚蠢的，對這種力量。
Well, if a man was foolish enough to trifle

1118
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,530
視如兒戲，
with this power,

1119
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:20,040
那麼他會自我毀滅。
then it is he who has brought upon himself this destruction.

1120
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:21,540
你不能拯救他們。
You cannot save them.

1121
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:23,770
現在準備。
Now prepare.

1122
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,170
約翰！
John!

1123
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,880
不用擔心，看開點。
Don't worry, look away.

1124
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,750
它只會花一秒鐘。
It'll only take a second.

1125
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:32,710
住手！
Stop!

1126
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,390
給我的劍。
Give me the sword.

1127
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,500
你好，朱莉亞。
Hello, junior.

1128
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,540
爸爸？
Dad?

1129
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,670
我們埋葬了你。
We buried you.

1130
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,510
我們以為你死了。
We thought you were dead somewhere.

1131
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,610
對不起，兒子。
I'm sorry, son.

1132
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,420
我們找了你這麼久，爸爸。
We looked for you for so long, Dad.

1133
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:09,960
然後我發現你的日記。
And then I found your journal.

1134
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,190
我把它在一個地方，我知道它會被發現。
I left it in a place I knew it would be discovered.

1135
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:15,020
我曾希望，如果你發現了它，它會給你一些答案。
I had hoped if you found it, it would give you some answers.

1136
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,590
它給了我答案，但目前更多的問題。
It gave me answers, but far more questions.

1137
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,430
它基本上是什麼讓我在這裏。
It's basically what got me here.

1138
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,530
發生了什麼事，爸爸？
What happened, Dad?

1139
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,440
你去哪兒？
Where did you go?

1140
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:23,670
我知道你有很多的問題，
I know you have a lot of questions,

1141
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,240
你應該。
and you should.

1142
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:29,770
我一直在第十三後頭骨了這麼多年，
I've been after the thirteenth skull for so many years,

1143
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,550
我來了這麼近，
I had come so close,

1144
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:36,510
然後我發現這個地方和兄弟會。
and then I found this place and the brotherhood.

1145
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,350
這是兄弟會的最後一個據點。
This is the brotherhood's last stronghold.

1146
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,350
它守住我們最後的秘密。
It holds the last of our secrets.

1147
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:43,650
什麼樣的秘密？
What secrets?

1148
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,390
我發現頭骨，約翰。
I found the skull, John.

1149
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,430
它是真實的，就像我一直都知道這將是！
It's real, just like I always knew it would be!

1150
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:51,190
他們給了我一個選擇。
They gave me a choice.

1151
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,630
我可以死，
I could die,

1152
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,920
或者我可以加入與他們。
or I could join with them

1153
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,200
在保護頭骨的秘密。
in protecting the secrets of the skulls.

1154
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:02,370
我已經尋找了這麼久，什麼也不在乎。
I had been searching so long, nothing else mattered.

1155
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,380
顯然你不在乎你的家人。
Obviously your family didn't matter.

1156
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,580
你的選擇導致你兒子死亡。
Your choice lead to your son's death.

1157
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,560
泰利步你的後塵。
Terry died wanting to follow in your footsteps.

1158
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:21,390
我愛你和你的兄弟比你永遠不會知道，
I loved you and your brother more than you will ever know,

1159
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,560
但是這是我無法拒絕的。
but this was something I couldn't refuse.

1160
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,100
一切後，我看到了，一切我已經學會了。
After everything I had seen, everything I had learned.

1161
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,640
這是不是一種選擇，這是我的命運。
It wasn't a choice, it was my destiny.

1162
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:37,300
也許你的命運，可以善加利用。
Maybe your destiny could be put to good use.

1163
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,520
世界第十三頭骨，爸爸。
The world is the thirteenth skull, Dad.

1164
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,550
你知道他們永遠不會讓你擁有它。
You know they will never let you have it.

1165
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,020
不要讓泰利無謂的犧牲！
Don't let Terry's death be in vain!

1166
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:51,120
沒有頭骨，數十億就會死亡。
Without the skull, billions will die.

1167
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,250
如果頭骨已聚集，
If the skulls have been gathered,

1168
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:58,360
和世界末日已經開始，就這樣吧。
and the end of the world has begun, so be it.

1169
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,900
這是人的命運。
This is man's destiny.

1170
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,130
人類的命運騎在你的肩膀。
Man's destiny rides on your shoulders.

1171
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,680
你明白，他們不能永遠離開這個地方，現在。
You understand that they cannot ever leave this place now.

1172
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,940
是的，我知道。
Yes, I know.

1173
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,880
我只要求沒有看。
I only ask that I do not have to watch.

1174
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:15,480
是的，我們不希望你心煩。
Yeah, we wouldn't want you to be upset

1175
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:18,420
看你最後一個兒子被殺害你的命運！
watching your last son be killed for your destiny!

1176
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,850
你會殺了我們這裏，在金字塔？
You're going to kill us here, in the pyramid?

1177
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,120
你有沒有榮譽？
Do you have no honour?

1178
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,320
女人，不跟我說話這個樣子！
Woman, do not speak to me like this!

1179
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,690
我已經花了我的一生捍衛榮譽這個地方。
I have spent my life defending the honour of this place.

1180
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,390
從未有紀念那些誰殺了，侯賽因！
There is never honour for those who kill, Hussein!

1181
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:39,110
對不起，老朋友。
I'm sorry, old friend.

1182
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,180
跟著我，這邊！
Follow me, this way!

1183
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,460
沒有，先生，該中隊在空中待命。
No, sir, the squadron is in the air awaiting orders.

1184
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,240
磁場是95％，先生。
The magnetic field is at 95 percent, sir.

1185
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,890
這一次，我們讓所有人都離開這裏。
It's time we get everybody out of here.

1186
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:22,710
上校，你的炸彈不會丟你認為他們會。
Colonel, your bombs aren't going to do what you think they will.

1187
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,940
只要給他們更多的時間。
Just give them more time.

1188
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,460
我給他們盡可能多的時間。
I'll give them as much time as I can.

1189
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:34,020
在那之後，我下命令。
After that, I'm under orders.

1190
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:34,960
謝謝。
Thank you.

1191
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,030
如果我們每個人都生活那麼久再感謝我。
Thank me if we all live that long.

1192
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,630
我們得離開這裏。
We've gotta get out of here.

1193
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,620
米切爾，叫上我爸爸。
Mitchell, call my father.

1194
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,650
爸爸，你在做什麼？
Dad, what are you doing?

1195
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,460
這個地方是我的生命，約翰。
This place is my life, John.

1196
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,490
我無處可去。
I have nowhere to go.

1197
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,590
讓我死在這裏。
Let me die here.

1198
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:46,570
對兄弟會所做的我不值得活。
I don't deserve to live after what I did to the brotherhood.

1199
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,830
你在說什麼？
What're you talking about?!

1200
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:51,340
現在你有不同的生活，
You have a different life now,

1201
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,870
你已經有了一個孫女！
you've got a granddaughter!

1202
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:53,870
我有一個孫女？
I have a granddaughter?

1203
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,340
沒錯！泰利的女兒！她馬上7歲了！
Yes! Terry's daughter! She's going to be seven!

1204
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,300
真的嗎？ 是的！
Really? Yes!

1205
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:03,940
爸爸！
Dad!

1206
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,450
對不起，兒子。
I'm sorry, son.

1207
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,580
爸爸，不！
Dad, no!

1208
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,590
來吧，我們必須去。
Come on, we have to go.

1209
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,170
約翰，加油！現在！
John, come on! Now!

1210
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,860
- 爸爸！ - 來吧，約翰，現在！
- Dad! - Come on, John, now!

1211
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,700
主席先生，磁場達到100％。
Sir, the magnetic fields are at 100 percent.

1212
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,070
我怕你的人都出來的時候，先生。哈登。
I'm afraid your people are out of time, Mr. Hadden.

1213
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,100
阿爾法中隊，時間目標？
Alpha Squadron, time to target?

1214
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,530
複製。
Copy that.

1215
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,400
8分鐘。
Eight minutes.

1216
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,510
我們必須讓每個人都出在一個安全的最小距離。
We've got to get everyone out at a safe minimum distance

1217
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,480
前引爆。
before detonation.

1218
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:11,610
你聽說過他們，他們是在他們的途中！
You heard them, they're on their way!

1219
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,600
我已經給了他們足夠的時間，我可以，先生。哈登。
I've given them as much time as I can, Mr. Hadden.

1220
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,160
我們不能再等下去了。
We can't wait any longer.

1221
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,250
- 我們在這裏完成。 - 是的，先生。
- We're finished here. - Yes, sir.

1222
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,480
爸爸！
Daddy!

1223
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:20,860
我告訴你，他們會做吧。
I told you they'd make it.

1224
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,760
我不是回顧炸彈。
I'm not re-calling the bombs

1225
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,460
直到我敢肯定這件事情的作品。
until I'm certain this thing works.

1226
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,870
讓我們這樣做之前，為時已晚。
Let's do this before it's too late.

1227
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,690
西裝應該保護你從光。
The suit should protect you from the light.

1228
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:46,210
它限制你接觸到的任何電離輻射，
It limits your exposure to any ionizing radiation,

1229
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,620
但我不能做出任何承諾。
but I can't make any promises.

1230
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,220
我真的不知道發生了什麼，
I don't actually know what's happening,

1231
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,760
但似乎漩渦正在消退。
but it seems that the vortex is dissipating

1232
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,950
和風暴似乎即將結束！
and the storm seems to be coming to an end!

1233
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,260
約翰。
John.

1234
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:54,540
哦，謝謝。
Oh, thanks.

1235
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,520
我認為，我們需要喝一杯。
I think we need to get a drink.

1236
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:06,050
當我說我們我的意思是我。
And when I say we I mean me.

1237
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,460
這是你的回合，教授。
It's your round, professor.

1238
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,060
你怎麼了，先生？
Are you ok, sir?

1239
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:14,190
叫我的醫生。
Call my doctor.

1240
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:15,290
馬上，先生。
Right away, sir.

1241
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,530
- 上校。 - 是嗎？
- Colonel. - Yes?

1242
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,640
如果你能可能幫助我的東西。
If you could possibly help me with something...

1243
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:21,630
如果我可以。
lf l can.

1244
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,510
關鍵九基地，我們準備好了。
Key Nine to Base, we're ready.

1245
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,570
好吧，密封腔。
Alright, seal the chamber.

1246
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,570
收到。
Copy that.

1247
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:19,780
結束了。
It's over.

1248
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,390
現在怎麼辦？

西耶娜，我很抱歉。

1252
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:52,120
沒關係，我想我知道這遲早要來。
It's ok, I guess I knew it was coming

我只是不知道什麼時候。
