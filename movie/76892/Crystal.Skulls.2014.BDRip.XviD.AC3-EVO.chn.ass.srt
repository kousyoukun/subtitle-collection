1
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,490
There it is.

2
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,510
What we know is that last night,

3
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,210
here at the National Museum in Washington D.C.,

4
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,790
an artifact known as one of the infamous crystal skulls

5
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
was stolen.

6
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,450
This is apparently not the first crystal skull to be taken

7
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,530
and, according to the museum's director,

8
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,690
there have been at least six skulls in the past two years

9
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,030
from museums and collections from across the globe

10
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,560
that have disappeared under nefarious circumstances.

11
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,270
For CNB News this is Joshua O'Dell.

12
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
Senor.

13
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,460
Salut.

14
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,750
I assume it's authentic.

15
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,320
Without a doubt.

16
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,750
You see, my employer would be very disappointed

17
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,620
if it turned out to be a forgery.

18
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
How did you obtain the artifact?

19
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,660
Given the nature of my business,

20
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,360
you can understand why I cannot reveal such details.

21
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,470
There are strict regulations about the transport

22
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,070
and sale of such antiquities.

23
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,470
Again, my employer would be very-

24
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,700
Your employer either wants what I have to offer or he does not.

25
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,110
In which case, I have other buyers to meet.

26
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,580
You didn't travel 200 miles up into the Andes

27
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,590
if you had other buyers.

28
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,360
Then we are ready to do business? Yes?

29
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,190
When you contacted our representative,

30
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,290
your message included a certain purchase price.

31
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,040
And I believe the amount was more than fair.

32
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,730
As does my employer.

33
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,030
Do you have the item with you?

34
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,580
I'm not a fool, Mr. Mitchell.

35
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,840
But it is close by.

36
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,920
Do you have the money?

37
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,550
I'm not a fool either.

38
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,760
Follow me.

39
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,450
You going to count it?

40
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,460
That will not be necessary.

41
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,620
Then, my friend,

42
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,760
we're finished here.

43
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,740
What you have feared has come true.

44
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,770
And what have I feared?

45
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,470
He's gathering the skulls.

46
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,340
He understands that together they have power.

47
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,510
Who?

48
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,710
The rich man.

49
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,520
The infidel, Hadden.

50
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
He's an old man,

51
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,820
a foolish man who is driven by dreams of power

52
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,590
derived from the skulls.

53
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,960
He is a dangerous man, you understand?

54
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,490
Yes, I understand, but the real danger is that

55
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,500
without the thirteenth skull

56
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,560
there will be no way to control them.

57
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,330
The other twelve could become unstable

58
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,940
and cause massive destruction.

59
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,540
This is why the brotherhood has given you a task.

60
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,670
There will be bloodshed.

61
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,870
Are you asking me for my approval or my opinion?

62
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,170
I don't need your approval.

63
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,780
Then my opinion is that there is no need for violence,

64
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,510
he just needs to be stopped.

65
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,150
You're a fool to believe a rich man can be stopped

66
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,750
without bloodshed.

67
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,030
I understand you have a mission and I wish you good luck,

68
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,660
but don't let your anger poison you, Hussein.

69
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,470
Check all your equipment.

70
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,540
You sure we have enough rope?

71
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,480
You sure there's something down there?

72
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,350
I wouldn't be doing this

73
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,020
if I didn't think there was something down there.

74
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,750
You know how I feel about heights, Terry.

75
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,550
Don't worry about it.

76
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,020
Have I ever let you down?

77
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,460
Three, four times, tops.

78
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,150
Climbing is my business.

79
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,190
You're just gonna have to suck it up.

80
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,830
Look at that, bro.

81
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Go easy...

82
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,330
...over the lip.

83
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,530
Whooo!

84
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,950
Go steady, bro.

85
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
Look at that!

86
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,340
Yeah.

87
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,510
Holy cow.

88
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,750
It was here.

89
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,910
Yeah? How can you be so sure?

90
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,460
This is the last place in his notebook that he visited.

91
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,930
After living with his obsession with the thirteenth skull

92
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,460
For all these years,

93
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,630
we're finally going to find it.

94
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,660
After you.

95
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,600
You're the archaeologist.

96
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, you're the adventurer.

97
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,800
The wife would argue with that.

98
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,140
She says I'm a glorified tour guide.

99
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,070
So guide.

100
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,570
Ok, brother.

101
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,850
There's no GPS down here so I'm working off old maps.

102
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,420
It's down this cave another couple hundred meters.

103
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,160
You sure dad was here?

104
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,090
He describes this tunnel.

105
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,100
For all we know,

106
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,800
what's left of him is lying around down here somewhere.

107
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,480
We owe it to him to find whatever it was he was after.

108
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,270
You ready for that?

109
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,610
I'm ready for that.

110
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,810
You ready for that?

111
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,610
I guess so.

112
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,120
We'll be alright.

113
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,390
If you say so, brother.

114
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
After you.

115
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,220
Is everything ready?

116
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,030
Yes, they've been awaiting your arrival.

117
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,090
Any problems?

118
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,530
Me? No.

119
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,610
Bloke I got this from might have a different opinion.

120
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,690
Why's that?

121
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,840
I don't think you want to know that, Ms. Mallory.

122
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,270
The lab has been built eight levels underground.

123
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,570
You expecting trouble?

124
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,670
Let's hope not.

125
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,120
Watch yourself.

126
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,250
This way.

127
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Watch your feet.

128
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
HEY,

129
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,580
looks like we found something.

130
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,380
We did, didn't we?

131
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,610
After you.

132
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,820
Age before beauty.

133
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
Is that him?

134
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,540
You didn't think he'd miss this moment, do you?

135
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,770
Mr. Hadden?

136
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,570
Mr. Mitchell.

137
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,970
Bravo .

138
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Thank you, sir.

139
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,020
I don't know how much time I may have left,

140
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,060
so let's not waste any more of it.

141
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,390
Is that normal?

142
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,140
Well, as far as we're aware,

143
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,670
this is the first time the skulls have been reunited

144
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,140
in the history of mankind.

145
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
What's happening?

146
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,640
There's sonic vibration at sixteen hertz.

147
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,740
I feel a little sick.

148
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,550
I don't know how they're doing it,

149
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,020
but these things are generating their own magnetic field.

150
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,280
That's not possible.

151
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,710
Tell them that.

152
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,290
What's it say?

153
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,430
Thursday night is ladies night.

154
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,500
All women will be admitted, no cover.

155
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,060
All drinks two shackles.

156
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,230
What?

157
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,530
I have no idea.

158
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,100
But they're in dad's book.

159
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,540
Twelve distinct symbols.

160
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,450
How can you know that, smart guy

161
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,120
if you don't even know what they say.

162
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,760
Well, I don't need to be able to translate them

163
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,860
in order to know that is Acadian,

164
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,190
this is Egyptian,

165
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,060
those over here I don't really recognize.

166
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,290
This, this looks pre-Colombian.

167
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,400
Most likely Mayan.

168
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,340
South American?

169
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,700
What the hell's it doing here?

170
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,070
Exactly.

171
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,710
Pre-Babylonian, Sumerian, we've got Egyptian, possibly Mayan.

172
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,480
My guess is it's twelve different groups

173
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,680
representing a different early civilization.

174
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,790
So what's the thirteenth for?

175
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
I mean, you've got twelve sets of symbols,

176
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,990
twelve ancient civilizations, twelve skulls.

177
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,690
If there really is a thirteenth skull,

178
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,850
what's that about?

179
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,430
That, my friend, is a good question.

180
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,400
I really have no idea at this point,

181
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,030
but I'm sure I'm gonna find out.

182
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,940
I think I'm gonna puke!

183
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,910
Yeah, it's the frequency.

184
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,750
Certain modulations cause nausea.

185
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,950
At seven hertz, it can cause your body to come apart

186
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,220
at a nuclear level.

187
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,620
Is off the scale!

188
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
We're gonna lose it. Clear the room.

189
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Clear the room!

190
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,070
Get them out of there!

191
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,300
We've tried to activate the shut-down-

192
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,170
Just do what I tell you!

193
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
Whoa.

194
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,490
What'd you touch?

195
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,570
Nothing! I didn't do anything!

196
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,940
I told you not to touch anything!

197
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Wow.

198
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,550
Code Level Red

199
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,200
Colonel, the pulse has dissipated.

200
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,240
Do we have any reports of a nuclear detonation?

201
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,390
Negative, sir.

202
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,030
Nothing?

203
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
No, sir.

204
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:14,860
Nothing.

205
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,100
Satellite or seismic.

206
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,110
Then what the hell was it?

207
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,680
We've picked up an electro-magnetic burst,

208
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,340
and it appears it's originated in Vienna.

209
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Vienna?

210
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,880
Vienna, Austria?

211
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,540
As in Mozart and chocolates?

212
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,680
That's correct, sir.

213
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Alright.

214
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,390
Commander of the watch, take us back to yellow.

215
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Yes, sir.

216
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,350
Electra-magnetic pulses don't just come out of nowhere.

217
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,630
Roger that, sir.

218
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Major.

219
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,010
Tell the joint chiefs they'll know what it was when I know what it was.

220
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,670
All of it is back to normal except...

221
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,740
The skulls are still generating a field.

222
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Exactly.

223
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,400
They're holding steady for the moment, but-

224
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
You saw what happened.

225
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,640
Yes, of course.

226
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,280
Well, we knew that the skulls possess unique magnetic qualities.

227
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,220
If your theory was correct, the thirteenth should have-

228
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,450
Should have been able to control the others.

229
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,720
The theory isn't the problem.

230
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,760
The problem is that that wasn't the thirteenth skull.

231
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,630
You're not blaming this cock-up on me, are you?

232
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,030
Who exactly should we blame for this unmitigated disaster,

233
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,130
Mr. Mitchell?

234
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,740
Mr. Hadden-

235
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:00,040
You vouched for the authenticity and you delivered a forgery.

236
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,950
Mr. Hadden, I'm really sorry but in my line of work

237
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,420
people have a tendency to lie.

238
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,020
Is that so, Mr. Mitchell?

239
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,520
I was going on information supplied by your contacts, sir.

240
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,150
Yes, and you were supposed to vet this information, am I correct?

241
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,850
Yes, sir.

242
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,760
You could have gone and interrogated the chap

243
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,800
who gave it to you, but that would have been too difficult,

244
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,230
wouldn't it?

245
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,130
Yes, sir.

246
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,180
Everybody makes mistakes.

247
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,950
Thank you, Mr. Hadden.

248
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,350
Don't ever make another one.

249
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,650
Yes, sir.

250
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,790
Go and get the real skull.

251
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,690
Go with him.

252
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,430
There isn't a lot of time.

253
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,710
I want the families of those two men who died

254
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,540
taken care of.

255
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes, sir.

256
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,880
A strange electrical disturbance

257
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,480
rocked Vienna, Austria last night

258
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,990
with power outages...

259
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,990
...There was a large blast in the centre of the city...

260
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,820
...Coming in now, the French NATO troops

261
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
high alert following...

262
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,430
...BMP...

263
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,050
...Any word from city or government officials...

264
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,700
...Have refused to comment on this...

265
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,200
...Government officials on what has caused this...

266
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,540
...Detonation of an atomic weapon...

267
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,040
...What seems to be a high-profile meeting

268
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,300
with the president...

269
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,240
I'm Melanie Cox, live from Vienna, stay with us.

270
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
Wow.

271
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Cool.

272
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,620
Be careful what you touch, things could be booby-trapped.

273
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,540
Sorry, bro.

274
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,960
It's dad's ring.

275
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,290
You were right.

276
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
No, no, don't touch it!

277
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,040
What did I just tell you?

278
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,660
I didn't touch anything!

279
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,370
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

280
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,670
Let's get out of here!

281
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,980
Go!

282
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,250
Hurry, John!

283
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,700
Ok, come on.

284
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,110
Clip in.

285
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,610
You in?

286
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,320
- All set. - Ok.

287
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Remote.

288
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,630
Slack is out.

289
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Come on.

290
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
What's wrong?

291
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,970
It's not working.

292
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,170
No.

293
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,440
Give me yours, we'll go together.

294
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,570
Clip in.

295
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,770
Come on, come on!

296
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
What're you doing??

298
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,380
Terry!

299
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm sorry, brother.

300
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,390
We can do this together, come on!

301
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,860
Terry, don't do this!

302
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,360
It's the only way.

303
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm sorry.

304
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Terry!

305
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,030
I love you, man.

306
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,540
Terry!!

307
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,830
My brother always stood by me

308
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,370
even though he didn't always believe in

309
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,700
what I was doing.

310
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,500
I guess that's what I'll miss most about him.

311
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,150
Luh...

312
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,460
I want to thank everybody for coming today

313
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
and paying your respects.

314
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,600
It would mean a lot to my brother.

315
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,620
Thank you.

316
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,730
Mommy, I miss my daddy.

317
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,910
I know you miss your daddy, sweetie.

318
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,480
I miss your daddy, too.

319
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,680
And if there's anything ever that you need,

320
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,450
you ask your Uncle John, ok?

321
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,620
Ok, Uncle John.

322
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,790
I guess it runs in the family.

323
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,620
What's that?

324
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,540
No body, no casket.

325
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,600
Laura, I'm so sorry.

326
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,640
I...

327
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,180
It wasn't your fault.

328
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,150
He was my little brother.

329
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,550
I should have protected him. He didn't have to come with me.

330
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,280
He looked up to you.

331
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,220
He would have followed you anywhere.

332
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,010
- Professor Winston? - Not now, please.

333
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,750
- Hello, Professor Winston. - Ladies.

334
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,320
Do you mind telling me what this is?

335
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,060
What's it look like?

336
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,270
It looks like my classes have been cancelled.

337
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,830
That is what it says, yes.

338
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,730
Would you care to elucidate?

339
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,870
I don't understand why.

340
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,470
I thought after your brother's death

341
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,540
you might want some time.

342
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,170
Hmm.

343
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,510
No, I don't need time.

344
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,810
I just need to get back to my teaching.

345
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,120
It isn't quite that easy, John.

346
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,620
You're the head of the department, Gerry.

347
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,930
Why don't you just make it that easy?

348
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,190
I'm the head of the department who must answer

349
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,530
to the president of the college,

350
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,690
who in turn has to answer to the board of trustees.

351
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,000
And what do the trustees have to do with any of this?

352
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,330
You're the one who told these kids

353
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,870
about some god forsaken crystal skull story.

354
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,640
Gerald, are you kidding me now?

355
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,540
It's just a theory.

356
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,670
You and I both know that.

357
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,440
That's right, a theory.

358
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,480
Isn't that what we're trying to do here?

359
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,610
To help kids think for themselves?

360
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,120
One of the school's largest donors objected.

361
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,450
My hands are tied.

362
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,760
So now donors dictate curriculum?

363
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,870
They were going to pull the funding, John.

364
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,430
All the funding.

365
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,670
We're talking fifty faculty jobs.

366
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,700
Ok, alright.

367
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,470
Tell me who it is.

368
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,110
I'll talk to them, maybe I can convince them, if-

369
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,570
No, there's no convincing them.

370
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,870
Their minds are made up.

371
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,180
You're a world class archaeologist, John,

372
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,910
and a fine academic.

373
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,620
You had to know that something like this

374
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,780
would catch up with you sooner or later.

375
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,020
John. I am truly sorry about this.

376
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,390
Me too.

377
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,410
He's been in there a long time.

378
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,620
Give it a few more minutes.

379
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,620
A few more minutes and he'll have a bloody lap dance.

380
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,290
Alright, that's it.

381
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,060
Leave it any longer and he's going to be absolutely smashed.

382
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,200
Look on the bright side. You can carry him out.

383
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,740
I'm not going to have him throw up on my brand new suit.

384
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Come on.

385
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,460
If you've got a pen, I'll sign it for you.

386
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,440
If you're lucky, some day it'll be worth something.

387
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,510
Actually, our employer is very interested

388
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,900
in discussing it with you.

389
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,070
Alright,

390
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,520
what is his or her name? I will make it out to he or she-

391
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,520
William Hadden.

392
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,350
H-A-D-D-E-N.

393
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,800
William Hadden?

394
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,330
The very wealthy technology fellow?

395
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,440
Yeah, that'd be the one.

396
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,500
Now what would he want with my book?

397
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,840
Not your book, mate.

398
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
You.

399
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,170
Me?

400
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,620
Let's just say for the moment that he has a very deep,

401
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,150
personal interest in the subject matter.

402
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,060
Well, perhaps you should tell Mr. Hadden

403
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,530
that he's slightly misguided.

404
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,300
Crystal skulls are a theory.

405
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,200
Apparently not a very good one.

406
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,040
Oh s my'

407
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,330
Well, what if we told you

408
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,410
it was a little more than just a theory.

409
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,670
I'd say that you guys need another drink.

410
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,410
And by "you guys" I mean me.

411
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,610
Please.

412
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,650
It's me.

413
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,900
Yes, they are inside now.

414
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,460
I understand my mission.

415
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,640
They will not acquire the thirteenth skull.

416
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,780
It sounds like you want me to make a statement.

417
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,410
Fine.

418
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,610
It will be handled that way.

419
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,940
So I take it you don't want me to sign the book?

420
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,470
Mr. Hadden would like you to accompany us to Vienna.

421
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,880
He would like to talk to you in person about the skulls.

422
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Vienna sounds lovely.

423
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,190
But unfortunately I've got some students,

424
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,820
lectures to attend to.

425
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,090
Really?

426
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,160
Because we heard you've been given a sabbatical

427
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,560
from your teaching obligations.

428
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,830
Oh, you heard about that?

429
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,200
Mr. Hadden was the one that relieved you

430
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,670
of those obligations.

431
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
Now why would he want to do that?

432
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,440
He's got bigger fish to fry, no?

433
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,300
He wants you to come to Vienna

434
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,500
to discuss you and your father's life's work.

435
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,570
He thought it would be better if he had your

436
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,580
Get him out!

437
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,620
Up the stairs! Go!!!!

438
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,730
Who was that guy and why was he shooting at you?

439
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,310
He wasn't shooting at me, he was aiming for you!

440
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,530
He was what?

441
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,640
The thirteenth skull is still out there

442
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,740
and there are people who would do anything to stop it

443
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,900
from being found.

444
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,470
Including fanatics like that guy.

445
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,180
Well if Hadden wanted my undivided attention,

446
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,820
he certainly has it now.

447
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,580
Go, go!

448
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,110
I want updates on the Vienna pulse.

449
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,840
There's still an electro-magnetic signal

450
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,640
being generated from the location, sir.

451
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,940
What's the source?

452
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,210
No way to tell yet, sir.

453
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,280
Signal strength is holding steady,

454
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,610
no signs of dissipating.

455
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,750
So they're still capable of generating another pulse?

456
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
Yes, colonel.

457
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
If the second one is stronger,

458
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,160
they could black out half of Europe.

459
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,360
Notify local authorities on the ground in Vienna.

460
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,860
And I want a go team assembled in 15 minutes on the pad.

461
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,140
How much longer?

462
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,450
We land at Heathrow, and then we're going on a chopper

463
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,740
for the final leg to Vienna.

464
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
A chopper?

465
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,950
I kinda like the jet.

466
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,690
The EMP burst nearly dropped every plane from the sky

467
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,550
around Vienna, so, for our own protection,

468
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,790
we're switching to a form of travel

469
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,160
that's a little less precarious.

470
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,260
A little less precarious?

471
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,820
Lower your weapons!

472
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,800
Put 'em down! Now!

473
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,490
Go to the left.

474
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,230
Move!

475
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,640
The rest of you men, on me.

476
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,090
That's far enough, Colonel.

477
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,880
Order your men to lower their weapons.

478
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,420
You lower your weapons, sir.

479
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,820
This is a private property and therefore

480
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,950
you have no authority to enter this facility.

481
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,250
Really?

482
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,580
I'm the United States Army commanding NATO forces.

483
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,260
I've got the authority to call in a damn air strike

484
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,930
on this building if I wanted to.

485
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,700
You really want to go down that road?

486
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,680
You're out-gunned, son.

487
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,910
Tell your men to put their weapons down

488
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,950
and no one gets hurt

489
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,450
Alright.

490
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,560
So, who's in charge of this facility?

491
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,300
That would be me.

492
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,510
Colonel Bailey, I assume?

493
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,610
I'm afraid, sir,

494
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,830
that there's going to be a change of command.

495
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,570
This is a private research facility

496
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,310
wholly owned by Hadden Enterprises,

497
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,280
which is a private company wholly owned by me.

498
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,750
What it is, Mr. Hadden,

499
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,550
is the site of an unauthorized electro-magnetic pulse.

500
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,320
I'm authorized by NATO

501
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,520
to seize control of this wholly owned facility

502
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,160
until I know what the hell is happening here.

503
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,360
I will be filing a formal complaint with the EU.

504
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,070
You do that, sir.

505
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,470
Until I hear otherwise, Mr. Hadden,

506
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,930
there's a new sheriff in town.

507
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,150
So this is the best a billionaire

508
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,810
could come up with, huh?

509
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,950
An old military-style helicopter?

510
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,590
They have far less electronics, which makes them safer to fly

511
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
when you have problems with EMP.

512
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,470
That's very comforting.

513
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,340
Sienna, I was wondering...

514
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,030
what's Hadden's obsession with the crystal skulls?

515
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,100
You need to ask him about that.

516
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,310
If I get a chance, I will.

517
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,590
We have breaking news here.

518
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,550
It has just been confirmed that the electrical

519
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,150
disturbance that caused recent power outages

520
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,850
across western Europe did in fact center

521
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,620
from Hadden Industries research facilities...

522
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,190
...As you may remember, the owner of Hadden Industries

523
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,670
is billionaire, William S. Hadden,

524
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,900
a man who recently shocked Wall Street

525
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,840
when he decided to sell all of his US interests

526
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,130
to pursue European projects...

527
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,510
...As you may recall, the Hadden facility is the same facility

528
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,550
associated with the EMP blast that blacked out

529
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,170
most of western Europe.

530
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,580
We are awaiting an official statement and comments

531
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,480
from Hadden representatives,

532
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,080
given the nature of the incident,

533
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,990
on what exactly happened.

534
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
What's going on?

535
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
The magnetic field is growing.

536
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,350
Faster than the last one?

537
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,490
Exponentially.

538
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,470
What the hell is this?

539
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,400
There's nothing we can do to control the reaction.

540
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,630
It's breaking away.

541
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,430
Can someone please explain what I am looking at?

542
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,740
These are twelve crystal skulls gathered from around the world,

543
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,480
brought together for the first time.

544
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,680
What in God's name are you talking about?

545
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,520
I'm telling you that there's going to be another

546
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,610
electro-magnetic pulse, larger than the first one.

547
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,450
Generated by these crystal skulls?

548
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,580
Yes.

549
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,460
And there isn't anything we can do to stop it.

550
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,830
Well I'm going to stop it.

551
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,630
Weapons free, destroy the skulls.

552
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,900
Colonel, no.

553
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Colonel, please!

554
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,030
You have no idea what you're doing!

555
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,770
Fire!

556
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,760
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

557
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
What the hell was that?

558
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,900
Some kind of electronic pulse fried us.

559
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,500
I thought that this old chopper was protected from that?

560
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,340
Navigation systems have protection,

561
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,040
but the fuel pumps were updated last year.

562
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,780
And you didn't think, that when we needed a chopper

563
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,820
with pre-sold electronics, that that might be an issue?

564
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
We've got no power?

565
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:43,690
We're in a helicopter.

566
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,350
We're going to fall like a stone from the sky.

567
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,960
No, no, no.

568
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,460
We can auto-rotate.

569
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,390
Auto-what?

570
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,430
Choppers are just like planes.

571
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,460
The blade on the top acts like a giant wing except

572
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,800
we've got to start diving to make this work,

573
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,300
and this is a really bad place to auto-rotate and land.

574
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,400
We'll need to re-route the power to the fuel pump.

575
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,240
Well how the hell are we going to do that?!

576
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,190
Well, we can figure something out back there.

577
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,510
You know how to do this?

578
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,540
We have to figure out where the fuel pump is.

579
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,650
How long have we got until we have to put this thing down?

580
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,220
At this rate of descent, maybe another two minutes,

581
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,480
but we're going to have a hard landing

582
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,960
in the side of a mountain.

583
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,450
I found a genie.

584
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,620
Power cables.

585
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,360
I found them right here.

586
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,590
Fuel pumps are up there.

587
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,960
Put it into this up here, look.

588
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,220
These are the fuel lines here?

589
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
Yeah.

590
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,680
We're not going to clear the mountain range!

591
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,470
My job is to get these two people back,

592
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,700
we're not ditching!

593
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,630
Got it?

594
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,980
We've got engine power back!

595
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,090
Yes, nice!

596
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,880
That's awesome!

597
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,750
Excellent work, professor, excellent!

598
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,980
I think he's waking up.

599
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,150
Nice job, you save the poor bastard

600
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,590
and we get the chopper up!

601
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,830
Not too bad, if I say so myself!

602
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,740
No, no, no, no!

603
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,430
Oh, that's just brilliant, bloody brilliant!

604
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,270
No gas!

605
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,070
You loaded a generator with no fuel?

606
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,740
Sorry, sir.

607
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,040
Just shut up!

608
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,210
I need you--

609
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,010
I want to thank you for inviting me on this little adventure.

610
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:45,700
Professor--

611
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,470
Move. move, move!!!!!

612
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,890
You alright?

613
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,560
That was a nice way to arrive in Europe.

614
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,190
Yeah, you're welcome, Professor.

615
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,130
Now we've got to find transport to Vienna.

616
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,810
What the hell just happened?

617
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,610
You attempted to destroy them.

618
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,310
There is no way to remove them or destroy them.

619
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,060
Do you now understand that, Colonel?

620
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,530
We're still online, Mr. Hadden.

621
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,990
Check redundant systems.

622
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Sir,

623
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,670
I'm receiving a signal from the helicopter

624
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,070
transporting doctors Mallory and Winston.

625
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,330
What kind of signal?

626
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,630
An emergency beacon.

627
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,100
The chopper is down.

628
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,470
Are there any casualties?

629
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,170
Any injuries?

630
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:56,940
Don't know, sir.

631
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Dammit!

632
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,150
They must have flown right through the pulse.

633
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,920
Get a location on the crash site.

634
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:02,620
Yes, sir.

635
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,190
Who was on this chopper?

636
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,380
Sienna Mallory, my senior researcher,

637
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,260
and John Winston.

638
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,260
Winston? Professor John Winston?

639
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,560
Yes, Colonel.

640
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,160
He might just be the only one who can stop this.

641
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,460
But presently my only concern

642
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,260
is for Miss Mallory's well-being.

643
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,810
I just lost four soldiers, Mr. Hadden.

644
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,340
I'm not particularly concerned with your personal decadences.

645
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,620
Sienna Mallory is my daughter, Colonel.

646
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,080
So please,

647
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,860
use whatever resources you have at your disposal

648
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,550
and get them here as soon as possible.

649
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,690
Give my men those coordinates and I'll send a recovery team.

650
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,850
Yes, sir.

651
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,790
Mr. Hadden, I'm sorry.

652
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,640
I'm a father as well.

653
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,060
Thank you, Colonel.

654
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,400
Apology accepted.

655
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,970
Colonel! You have to see this!

656
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,920
I've just arrived here in Berlin where members of the G8

657
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,480
are now gathering for what seems to be an emergency meeting

658
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,220
regarding these strange weather phenomena

659
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,830
which seem to be increasing by the hour.

660
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,460
This weather phenomena has now reached critical mass

661
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,130
as you can see, it's now become a massive vortex!

662
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,030
I've just received breaking news that the military units

663
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,510
have now been moved into the city to assist with evacuation.

664
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,370
Now reports say

665
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,180
that a lightening storm has tripled in size

666
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,410
over the last 24 hours,

667
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,140
and that the giant vortex is now engulfing the city.

668
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,780
But as the vortex drifts farther across Europe,

669
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,220
I think the question on everybody's lips is

670
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,660
where do we evacuate to?

671
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,620
What is this?

672
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,860
If I'm right, it's the beginning of the end.

673
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,260
Don't take this the wrong way,

674
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,000
but I hope to God you're wrong.

675
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,350
Mr. Hadden, we have no choice.

676
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,710
We have to contain the lab and destroy the skulls.

677
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,550
That is impossible, Colonel.

678
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,010
We can't just sit here and do nothing!

679
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
Daddy!

680
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,050
I thought I had lost you!

681
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,030
Professor John Winston,

682
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,690
I'd like you to meet William Hadden.

683
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:03,490
My father.

684
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Mr. Hadden.

685
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,630
Professor, I was a great admirer of your father's,

686
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,870
as I am of you yourself.

687
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,700
This is Colonel Bailey.

688
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,470
Bailey.

689
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,370
Professor.

690
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,480
I appreciate the kind words,

691
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,340
I don't meet many fans of my father's

692
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,520
except for fringe groups and lunatics.

693
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,710
Well, I hope I'm neither.

694
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,350
Before I lost my ability to walk,

695
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,550
it was where I did my best thinking.

696
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,350
So, if you don't mind, shall we walk together?

697
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,820
I don't mind at all, if you don't mind explaining to me

698
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,960
what exactly it is that I'm doing here.

699
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,800
I'm a very wealthy man, Doctor Winston.

700
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,860
I have been for most of my life.

701
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,130
But, I fear my hubris has gotten the better of me

702
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,300
in the light of what is now happening.

703
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,510
I'll put this as simply as I can.

704
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:56,490
You're here, Doctor Winston, because I am dying.

705
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,230
I have been fighting cancer for ten years.

706
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,540
In my pursuit of a cure,

707
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,070
I became aware of the crystal skulls

708
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,870
and began to acquire them.

709
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,100
All of them but the thirteenth.

710
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Yes.

711
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,280
The first were found in South America,

712
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,340
followed by three others-

713
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,470
Forgive me for interrupting, sir,

714
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,570
I understand the history

715
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,740
but all the skulls have proven to be a fraud,

716
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,920
carbon dating has tested them to be no older

717
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,750
than 200 or 300 years.

718
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,950
Trust me, we have had our failures.

719
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,590
No one's perfect.

720
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,560
Let's just say the tests were somewhat suspect.

721
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,620
Suspect?

722
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,630
What are you saying?

723
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,470
The carbon dating was altered somehow?

724
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,960
You got the twelve different skulls

725
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,440
from all different pans of the world?

726
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:52,440
Hadden Industries owns

727
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,670
six of the largest carbon dating facilities.

728
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,740
So the tests were fake?

729
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,510
Let's just say we have a higher standard of proof.

730
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,340
Ah, right, right.

731
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,550
You duped the whole scientific community.

732
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,450
What we did was soften the purchase price

733
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,350
to take them off the museum displays.

734
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,620
Mr. Hadden may be a billionaire,

735
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,320
but everyone has their price.

736
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,620
Right, right.

737
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,490
So it's about money.

738
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,600
We're talking about putting together

739
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,760
twelve of the most precious objects in the world.

740
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,470
Something that would not happen if the truth

741
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
became common knowledge.

742
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,600
Mr. Hadden, I don't know what the implications are

743
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,000
of you altering these tests,

744
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,240
but I imagine it involves prison.

745
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,040
I am dying, Colonel.

746
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,270
Yeah, well, you're not dead yet.

747
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,210
Ok, hold on, hold on, hold on.

748
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,610
None of this really matters now.

749
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,550
The skulls are real.

750
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,590
So how old are they?

751
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,460
Most of them were dated about 500,000 years ago.

752
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,460
Others cannot be dated.

753
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,900
500,000 years?

754
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,360
That pre-dates man.

755
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,260
Which implies some other origin.

756
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,130
Perhaps extraterrestrials?

757
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,300
Mr. Hadden, I don't know if your carbon dating shenanigans

758
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,500
have lead to this disaster,

759
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,970
but I do know that I have another problem.

760
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,410
Preventing the end of the world.

761
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,240
You and I have the same goal, Colonel.

762
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:05,970
Colonel!

763
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,110
Enough!

764
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,950
Now if you and Professor Winston can come up with a solution,

765
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,150
I'm all ears.

766
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,720
But now I must confer with NATO

767
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,810
and come up with our own method.

768
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,520
Brute force will not work!

769
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,490
You saw what happened when your men attempted

770
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,790
to attack the skulls!

771
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,690
They have an impregnable field around them!

772
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,360
That was four men.

773
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,730
I'm talking about some stronger medicine.

774
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,600
We know force won't work.

775
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,030
What Will?

776
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,470
The thirteenth skull.

777
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,370
But the dilemma is

778
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,450
I have no idea where to begin to look for it.

779
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,950
I want you to follow your father's footsteps

780
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,110
and find it.

781
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,150
Fulfill your destiny.

782
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,150
Mr. Hadden-

783
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,750
Every single one of my resources

784
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,360
will be at your disposal.

785
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,390
God knows I created this disaster.

786
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,530
If I have to use every bit of my fortune to stop it,

787
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,620
so be it.

788
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,540
There's one thing that neither one of us has much of.

789
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,300
And what would that be?

790
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,740
Time.

791
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,180
So am I to assume this chopper is safer than the last one?

792
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,550
It's Cold War technology.

793
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,590
It's built to withstand a nuclear explosion.

794
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,290
So why didn't you tell me that Hadden was your father?

795
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,960
And spoil the surprise?

796
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,900
You know, we have a lot in common, Professor.

797
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
Really?

798
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,370
What's that?

799
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,870
We've both spent our lives trying to get out of the shadow

800
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,070
of our fathers.

801
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,950
Is that what Mallory is?

802
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,610
It was my mother's maiden name.

803
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,220
She died when I was a little girl.

804
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,230
Would it have made a difference if you had known who I was?

805
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:05,030
In what, how seriously I took you?

806
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,840
Or how attractive I thought you were when we first met?

807
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
Seriously?

808
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,910
So, do you uh...

809
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,380
always wait until you get a girl alone in a helicopter

810
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,510
before you bust a line like that out?

811
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,710
No, I usually wait to find out if the girl I'm hitting on

812
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,550
is the daughter of the billionaire.

813
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,850
Oh, sure.

814
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,290
Well then I guess it's a shame

815
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,290
that my inheritance is being held in a living trust.

816
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,820
Ahh.

817
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,100
So where are we going?

818
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,280
Your father told me to follow in my father's footsteps.

819
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,510
That is what I'm doing.

820
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,480
The thirteenth skull is down there?

821
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,550
No, this is the last place my father came

822
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,270
before he disappeared.

823
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,140
And this is the only way down?

824
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,480
I'm afraid so.

825
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,390
Ready?

826
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,650
We're here.

827
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,660
Easy, easy.

828
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,260
I've got ya.

829
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,540
That's interesting.

830
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,140
What?

831
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,580
Since I was here with Terry,

832
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,080
I find that this cave has collapsed.

833
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
That's good?

834
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,450
Not if we need another way out.

835
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,860
Or we could have avoided this entire extreme sports routine.

836
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,690
Yeah, fat chance. Come on.

837
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,640
How did you get your father's notebook

838
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,510
if they never found his body?

839
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,640
It was sent to me at a college where I was teaching

840
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,410
before your father had me fired.

841
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,580
Ok, well that doesn't explain who sent it to you.

842
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,780
You don't know?

843
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,260
It was your father.

844
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,700
He sent a note along with it.

845
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,460
He said that one of his researchers had found it

846
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,870
on an expedition and he thought perhaps one day

847
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,410
I would find it useful.

848
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,580
So this was the last place your father was?

849
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,740
This is where they found the notebook?

850
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,110
I'd be inclined to agree with you.

851
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,750
But if my father's research team had already been here

852
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,750
and they didn't find the thirteenth skull,

853
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,220
why are we here?

854
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,320
Hold this, please.

855
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,790
This is the last place that my father came.

856
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,630
Where my brother lost his life.

857
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,430
And I'm betting that the answer is still here.

858
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,540
We just have to know where to look for it.

859
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,120
Excuse me, gentlemen.

860
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,550
What is it?

861
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,390
The skulls are generating a very focused magnetic field

862
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,460
which begins in the isolation chamber

863
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,900
and extends out beyond the common line.

864
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:06,230
That's the line that separates the Earth's atmosphere

865
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,430
from outer space.

866
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,460
I know what it is.

867
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:13,530
It seems that it now extends back to the Earth's core.

868
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,740
What the hell does all that mean, Mr. Hadden?

869
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,280
It means that there's now a new field

870
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,610
competing with the existing one.

871
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,580
Alright, so now give me the bad news.

872
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,660
Volcanic and seismic activity,

873
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,500
and a good possibility that the Earth's iron crust

874
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,040
will crack like an egg,

875
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:46,740
and if that happens the planet will be literally torn apart

876
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,640
And the good news?

877
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,580
Mr. Pritchard.

878
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,220
At the current rate, sir, roughly 30 hours.

879
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,350
- Issue an evacuation order. - Yes, sir.

880
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,520
In 30 hours,

881
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,180
I am authorizing the use of a tactical

882
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,390
nuclear weapon at this site.

883
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,290
I'll vaporize those god forsaken things

884
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,030
back to wherever it is that they came from.

885
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,230
You saw what happened when your men attempted

886
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,060
to destroy them!

887
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,600
That was four soldiers, Mr. Hadden.

888
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,430
I'm talking about power that hasn't been unleashed

889
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,840
since Hiroshima.

890
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,910
You are going to be the man who ended the world.

891
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,080
Or maybe saved it.

892
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:43,990
You alright?

893
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,690
Mmmhmm.

894
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,330
This way.

895
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,420
Good job.

896
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,890
- You ok? - Yeah.

897
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,370
John?

898
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,640
Look.

899
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,750
John, you ok?

900
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:48,950
Yeah.

901
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,720
Yeah, I'm fine.

902
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,090
This is for you, my brother.

903
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,540
We're ready for the extraction.

904
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,550
Go ahead

905
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,120
Come on!

906
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,370
We've gotta get out of this place!

907
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,070
Yeah, no kidding.

908
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,300
Come on.

909
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,610
I'm glad that's behind us.

910
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,800
We don't need these anymore.

911
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,990
Ok.

912
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,470
Here, let me help you.

913
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,940
Alright, this way.

914
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,510
Let's go, come on.

915
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,820
What happened to the helicopter?

916
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,940
Someone shot it down.

917
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,520
Who?

918
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,780
I don't know.

919
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:26,020
Probably the same person who shot at me in the bar.

920
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,420
They stepped it up a notch or two.

921
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,650
Careful.

922
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,500
Agh!

923
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,350
What're you doing? That really hurt!

924
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,550
Mitchell, what the hell are you doing here?

925
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,810
Oh now come on.

926
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,940
You didn't really think Mr. Hadden

927
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,010
was going to let you traipse halfway across Europe

928
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,240
with his precious little girl

929
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,450
with nobody to keep an eye on you, did you?

930
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,050
What happened to the helicopter?

931
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,200
Someone took it down with a missile.

932
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,560
Someone who seems to be intent on killing me.

933
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,690
Do you have any idea who?

934
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,500
Religious fanatics, fringe groups,

935
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,260
- white supremacists, CIA... - Alright, alright.

936
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,200
You know, all I know is that before I met you

937
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,780
I had no idea that anyone would want to kill me.

938
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,310
I'm a likable enough kind of guy.

939
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,710
So you say. Now look,

940
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,240
do you want to stand around here and talk about

941
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,680
the assassins who are after you,

942
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,010
or do you want to get the hell out of here

943
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,380
before they work out that you weren't in the chopper

944
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,540
that they shot down?

945
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,480
Yeah, that's what I thought.

946
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,310
I want an EMP-shielded chopper standing by

947
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,530
to pull the rest of us out of here when the time comes.

948
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,110
Yes, sir.

949
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,410
They'll be here.

950
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,540
I hope you're right.

951
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,320
For everyone's sake.

952
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,260
Because I don't want to go down in history

953
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,190
as the man who authorized the detonation of a nuclear device

954
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,550
to save the world.

955
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,860
Then don't do it, Colonel.

956
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,890
It's out of my hands.

957
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,510
We should put these lights out and kill that heater.

958
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,880
It could attract the wrong kind of company,

959
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,780
if you know what I mean.

960
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,010
Yeah, well I'm cold, and we need light to figure this out.

961
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,210
Well, then you might as well send up a signal flare

962
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,520
and tell whoever is after us where we are.

963
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,220
Maybe you should put out that cheap cigar you're smoking.

964
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,730
The smell will attract the wrong kind of people.

965
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,160
It's a Cohiba.

966
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,700
Oh, well perfect.

967
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,360
In that case we'll only attract

968
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,490
the best kind of terrorists and assassins.

969
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,930
Besides, that's why we have you here.

970
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,730
To protect us.

971
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,600
Yeah, well I can't protect you from yourselves.

972
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,500
It's not here.

973
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,530
It has to be.

974
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,580
Yeah, well I can't see it and I'm tired.

975
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:13,520
Maybe we should grab a couple of hours of sleep.

976
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,780
Start fresh.

977
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,520
The sun will be up soon.

978
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,960
Although, if we don't crack this it won't matter.

979
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,760
How are we gonna get out of here without a chopper, Mitchell?

980
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,900
I'm not putting another bird up in the area

981
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,470
until we've secured it.

982
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,500
Now listen, professor.

983
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,610
You need to concentrate on saving the world.

984
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,900
I need to get some fresh air so I can think.

985
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,380
Go and give him a hand.

986
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,420
You see it?

987
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,490
See what?

988
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,060
There.

989
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,500
There it is!

990
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,500
I knew I would find it.

991
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,640
Let me show you where it is.

992
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,550
Have you two figured it out?

993
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,410
Yeah, maybe.

994
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,710
I need to report to Mr. Hadden and the Colonel

995
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,550
if you've cracked this or not.

996
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,020
This is not the map, this is the place.

997
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,520
These, these are the map.

998
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,720
I'm not following you.

999
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,260
They're stars.

1000
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,230
This drawing shows us exactly where to find

1001
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,600
the thirteenth skull.

1002
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,710
I thought you'd be excited.

1003
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,510
Well, the temple in that cave must be 3000 years old.

1004
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:44,670
I'd say more like five.

1005
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,040
Oh, even better.

1006
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,380
So all we have to do is figure out

1007
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,470
where that constellation appeared

1008
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,480
in the night sky 5000 years ago?

1009
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,610
Well, that's easy.

1010
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,010
You know, I realize that in order for the two of us

1011
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,960
to figure it out it would take months, maybe longer.

1012
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,720
But for one of your dad's super computers

1013
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,490
it should be a piece of cake.

1014
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,650
Right.

1015
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,440
Alright,

1016
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:21,140
enter the declination and extrapolate.

1017
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,890
Oh wait, we've got something.

1018
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,660
You two are a piece of work.

1019
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,000
Right, you wanted to know where that constellation appeared

1020
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,330
in the night sky 5000 years ago?

1021
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:48,310
Well, actually 5302 months and 11 days.

1022
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,980
There's your answer.

1023
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,840
What the hell is that?

1024
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,350
It's the Visoko Valley, it's theoretically a pyramid.

1025
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,610
That's where we're going.

1026
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,330
It's interesting how it has remained unexplored

1027
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:18,600
for thousands of years.

1028
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:22,110
People thought it was a natural formation for a long time.

1029
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,420
Oh, my father said the military put a clock on us.

1030
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:31,910
We have six hours.

1031
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,510
I hope Mitchell gets back before the world ends

1032
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,530
and he's out trying to rent a car.

1033
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,380
Really?

1034
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,490
That's an interesting choice.

1035
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,640
That's our man, that's our man!

1036
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,690
Oh boy.

1037
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,710
You work for the wealthiest man in the world

1038
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,110
and the best car you could rent was this?

1039
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:02,080
Well, excuse me, Mr. Trump, but they didn't take credit cards

1040
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,280
and this was all I could get with the cash I had.

1041
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,990
Well, so where are we going?

1042
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,210
Is that it?

1043
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,400
What were you expecting, Mitchell? Giza?

1044
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,600
Well, I don't know, maybe something bigger than that?

1045
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,660
It just looks like an odd-shaped hill.

1046
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,270
Well, it is a pyramid.

1047
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,900
Yeah, well I know that, Professor Smarty-Pants.

1048
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,340
All I'm saying is it doesn't look like a place

1049
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,180
that would hold the key to save the world.

1050
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:28,910
I see.

1051
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,950
And what do you suppose that would look like?

1052
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,320
Ok, alright, so what's the plan?

1053
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,880
We're gonna keep a low profile,

1054
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:37,010
stay away from the village until it gets dark,

1055
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,550
and then go in nice and quiet.

1056
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,530
That plan sounds as strong as the choice in cars.

1057
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:45,650
Get in the car.

1058
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,940
My goodness, could this be smaller?

1059
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,700
Where is everyone?

1060
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,030
How should I know?

1061
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,310
A town meeting, strip club?

1062
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,040
Strip club?

1063
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,240
These are nice people.

1064
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,970
You never know.

1065
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,490
Villages all need a good strip club.

1066
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,290
A little early, wouldn't you say?

1067
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,930
Well, I guess we know where everyone is.

1068
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:27,500
We've got to get out.

1069
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,800
- This will pass, give it time. - Look behind you.

1070
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,200
Oh, shoot.

1071
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,300
Get out.

1072
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,210
Just act normal.

1073
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:49,650
Don't look around.

1074
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:50,660
Don't react.

1075
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,800
Don't make it known we're being followed.

1076
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,620
But we are being followed, so how are we supposed to act?

1077
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,620
Casual.

1078
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:57,430
How many are there?

1079
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,300
There's two behind us and two in front of us.

1080
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,200
Just turn around and mingle.

1081
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,030
QKEY

1082
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:14,380
What are they doing?

1083
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,020
I've seen you before.

1084
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,550
Yes.

1085
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,090
And I have seen you, as well.

1086
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,560
Now, I'm afraid this will be our last meeting.

1087
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:08,400
Is that some kind of euphemism because you're going to kill us?

1088
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,530
Easy, Sienna.

1089
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:10,830
Don't antagonize the man.

1090
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,410
He's got a sword.

1091
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,530
Yeah, the professor has a point.

1092
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:20,880
Go on, enjoy your banter, because it will all end now.

1093
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,360
What is it that you're after?

1094
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,180
You know what we're after.

1095
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,180
You've been following us.

1096
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,720
Yes.

1097
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,590
It is ourjob to protect the thirteen.

1098
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,220
Skulls.

1099
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,700
They possess incredible power when they are brought together.

1100
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,010
Something your father did.

1101
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:50,940
Before you die, I wanted to ask you

1102
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,280
what it is you thought would happen once you found that

1103
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,580
which you seek?

1104
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:58,750
We need to work together in order to stop it.

1105
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,150
Stop what?

1106
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,880
Don't you know?

1107
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,620
The destruction caused by the twelve skulls

1108
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,820
being brought together.

1109
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,800
We need the thifleenth to stop it.

1110
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:15,300
Well, if a man was foolish enough to trifle

1111
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,530
with this power,

1112
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:20,040
then it is he who has brought upon himself this destruction.

1113
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:21,540
You cannot save them.

1114
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:23,770
Now prepare.

1115
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,170
John!

1116
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,880
Don't worry, look away.

1117
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,750
It'll only take a second.

1118
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:32,710
Stop!

1119
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,390
Give me the sword.

1120
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,500
Hello, junior.

1121
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,540
Dad?

1122
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,670
We buried you.

1123
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,510
We thought you were dead somewhere.

1124
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,610
I'm sorry, son.

1125
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,420
We looked for you for so long, Dad.

1126
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:09,960
And then I found your journal.

1127
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,190
I left it in a place I knew it would be discovered.

1128
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:15,020
I had hoped if you found it, it would give you some answers.

1129
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,590
It gave me answers, but far more questions.

1130
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,430
It's basically what got me here.

1131
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,530
What happened, Dad?

1132
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,440
Where did you go?

1133
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:23,670
I know you have a lot of questions,

1134
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,240
and you should.

1135
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:29,770
I've been after the thirteenth skull for so many years,

1136
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,550
I had come so close,

1137
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:36,510
and then I found this place and the brotherhood.

1138
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,350
This is the brotherhood's last stronghold.

1139
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,350
It holds the last of our secrets.

1140
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:43,650
What secrets?

1141
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,390
I found the skull, John.

1142
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,430
It's real, just like I always knew it would be!

1143
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:51,190
They gave me a choice.

1144
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,630
I could die,

1145
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,920
or I could join with them

1146
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,200
in protecting the secrets of the skulls.

1147
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:02,370
I had been searching so long, nothing else mattered.

1148
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,380
Obviously your family didn't matter.

1149
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,580
Your choice lead to your son's death.

1150
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,560
Terry died wanting to follow in your footsteps.

1151
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:21,390
I loved you and your brother more than you will ever know,

1152
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,560
but this was something I couldn't refuse.

1153
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,100
After everything I had seen, everything I had learned.

1154
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,640
It wasn't a choice, it was my destiny.

1155
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:37,300
Maybe your destiny could be put to good use.

1156
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,520
The world is the thirteenth skull, Dad.

1157
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,550
You know they will never let you have it.

1158
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,020
Don't let Terry's death be in vain!

1159
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:51,120
Without the skull, billions will die.

1160
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,250
If the skulls have been gathered,

1161
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:58,360
and the end of the world has begun, so be it.

1162
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,900
This is man's destiny.

1163
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,130
Man's destiny rides on your shoulders.

1164
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,680
You understand that they cannot ever leave this place now.

1165
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,940
Yes, I know.

1166
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,880
I only ask that I do not have to watch.

1167
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:15,480
Yeah, we wouldn't want you to be upset

1168
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:18,420
watching your last son be killed for your destiny!

1169
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,850
You're going to kill us here, in the pyramid?

1170
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,120
Do you have no honour?

1171
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,320
Woman, do not speak to me like this!

1172
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,690
I have spent my life defending the honour of this place.

1173
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,390
There is never honour for those who kill, Hussein!

1174
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:39,110
I'm sorry, old friend.

1175
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,180
Follow me, this way!

1176
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,460
No, sir, the squadron is in the air awaiting orders.

1177
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,240
The magnetic field is at 95 percent, sir.

1178
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,890
It's time we get everybody out of here.

1179
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:22,710
Colonel, your bombs aren't going to do what you think they will.

1180
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,940
Just give them more time.

1181
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,460
I'll give them as much time as I can.

1182
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:34,020
After that, I'm under orders.

1183
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:34,960
Thank you.

1184
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,030
Thank me if we all live that long.

1185
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,630
We've gotta get out of here.

1186
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,620
Mitchell, call my father.

1187
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,650
Dad, what are you doing?

1188
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,460
This place is my life, John.

1189
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,490
I have nowhere to go.

1190
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,590
Let me die here.

1191
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:46,570
I don't deserve to live after what I did to the brotherhood.

1192
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,830
What're you talking about?!

1193
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:51,340
You have a different life now,

1194
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,870
you've got a granddaughter!

1195
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:53,870
I have a granddaughter?

1196
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,340
Yes! Terry's daughter! She's going to be seven!

1197
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,300
Really? Yes!

1198
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:03,940
Dad!

1199
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,450
I'm sorry, son.

1200
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,580
Dad, no!

1201
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,590
Come on, we have to go.

1202
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,170
John, come on! Now!

1203
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,860
- Dad! - Come on, John, now!

1204
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,700
Sir, the magnetic fields are at 100 percent.

1205
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,070
I'm afraid your people are out of time, Mr. Hadden.

1206
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,100
Alpha Squadron, time to target?

1207
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,530
Copy that.

1208
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,400
Eight minutes.

1209
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,510
We've got to get everyone out at a safe minimum distance

1210
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,480
before detonation.

1211
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:11,610
You heard them, they're on their way!

1212
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,600
I've given them as much time as I can, Mr. Hadden.

1213
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,160
We can't wait any longer.

1214
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,250
- We're finished here. - Yes, sir.

1215
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,480
Daddy!

1216
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:20,860
I told you they'd make it.

1217
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,760
I'm not re-calling the bombs

1218
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,460
until I'm certain this thing works.

1219
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,870
Let's do this before it's too late.

1220
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,690
The suit should protect you from the light.

1221
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:46,210
It limits your exposure to any ionizing radiation,

1222
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,620
but I can't make any promises.

1223
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,220
I don't actually know what's happening,

1224
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,760
but it seems that the vortex is dissipating

1225
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,950
and the storm seems to be coming to an end!

1226
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,260
John.

1227
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:54,540
Oh, thanks.

1228
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,520
I think we need to get a drink.

1229
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:06,050
And when I say we I mean me.

1230
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,460
It's your round, professor.

1231
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,060
Are you ok, sir?

1232
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:14,190
Call my doctor.

1233
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:15,290
Right away, sir.

1234
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,530
- Colonel. - Yes?

1235
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,640
If you could possibly help me with something...

1236
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:21,630
lf l can.

1237
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,510
Key Nine to Base, we're ready.

1238
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,570
Alright, seal the chamber.

1239
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,570
Copy that.

1240
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:19,780
It's over.

1241
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,390
What now?

1242
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,760
One second.

1243
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,340
Her father is dead.

1244
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:46,910
Sienna, I'm so sorry.

1245
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:52,120
It's ok, I guess I knew it was coming

1246
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,200
I just didn't know when.

1247
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,220
I understand.

1248
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,800
I guess you do,

1249
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:06,200
more than anyone else.

1250
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:32,230
CMV has just learned that mysterious billionaire

1251
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,330
William Hadden has died.

1252
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,660
It is not known exactly when Mr. Hadden passed,

1253
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:39,210
but his representatives say that it was some time last week.

1254
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,840
Not since Howard Hughes has there been so much mystery

1255
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,700
surrounding the death of a billionaire.

1256
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,490
国家历史博物馆
 华盛顿

1257
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,490
它在这。

1258
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,510
据我们所知昨晚，

1259
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,210
华盛顿国家博物馆

1260
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,790
一件臭名昭著的艺术品水晶头骨

1261
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
被偷。

1262
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,450
这显然不是第一个水晶头骨被偷。

1263
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,530
并且，根据博物馆馆长所说，

1264
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,690
过去两年已有至少六个头骨。

1265
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,030
从博物馆和和全球收藏品

1266
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,560
不明原因消失。

1267
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,270
来自CNB新闻，约书亚奥德尔的报道。

1268
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,600
水晶头骨

1269
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,800
库斯科，秘鲁

1270
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
塞纳。

1271
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,460
萨吕。

1272
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,750
我认为它是真实的。

1273
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,320
毫无疑问。

1274
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,750
你看，我的雇主会很失望。

1275
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,620
如果它被证明是伪造的。

1276
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
你是怎么搞到这件艺术品的？

1277
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,660
考虑到我的业务性质，

1278
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,360
你可以理解为什么我不能透露这些细节。

1279
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,470
运输和销售此类文物

1280
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,070
大概有严格的规定。。

1281
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,470
再说一次，我的雇主非常希望

1282
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,700
你的老板希望要么我出价要么他不想要。

1283
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,110
在这种情况下，我有其他买家要见。

1284
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,580
你没必要行驶200英里到安第斯山脉。

1285
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,590
如果你有其他买家。

1286
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,360
那么我们准备好谈生意了？对不？

1287
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,190
当您联系您的代表，

1288
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,290
您的留言有一定的购买价格。

1289
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,040
我想那数额比较公道。

1290
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,730
因为确实我的雇主。

1291
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,030
你有你的项目？

1292
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,580
我不是一个傻瓜，米切尔先生。

1293
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,840
但就在附近。

1294
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,920
带钱了没？

1295
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,550
我也不是一个傻瓜。

1296
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,760
跟我走。

1297
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,450
要不要点下？

1298
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,460
没必要。

1299
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,620
那么，我的朋友，

1300
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,760
我们交易完了。

1301
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,740
你担心的事情已经发生了。

1302
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,770
我担心什么？

1303
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,470
他在收集头骨。

1304
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,340
他明白那聚集一起可以拥有权力。

1305
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,510
谁？

1306
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,710
财主。

1307
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,520
富人。

1308
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
他是一个老人，

1309
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,820
一个受权力梦驱使的无知的人。

1310
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,590
来自于头骨。

1311
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,960
他是个危险的人，你不懂吗？

1312
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,490
是的，我明白，但真正的危险是。

1313
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,500
没有第十三头骨

1314
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,560
将没有法来控制它们。

1315
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,330
其他12个可能变得不稳定。

1316
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,940
并造成大规模破坏。

1317
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,540
这就是兄弟会给你这个任务的原因。

1318
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,670
会有杀戮。

1319
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,870
你是在征求我的同意还是我的意见？

1320
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,170
我不需要你批准。

1321
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,780
那么我的观点是没必要暴力，

1322
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,510
只是阻止他。

1323
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,150
傻瓜才信一个富人会被阻止。

1324
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,750
而不是通过杀戮。

1325
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,030
我知道你有一个使命，我祝你好运，

1326
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,660
但别让你的愤怒害了你，侯赛因。

1327
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,900
korallgrottan洞穴，瑞典

1328
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,470
检查所有设备。

1329
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,540
确保我们有足够长的绳子？

1330
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,480
你肯定东西在那吗？

1331
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,350
我不会做。

1332
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,020
如果我不确认东西在下面。

1333
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,750
你知道我是怎么想海拔，泰利。

1334
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,550
别担心。

1335
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,020
我何曾让你失望？

1336
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,460
3，4次，上衣。

1337
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,150
登山是我的强项。

1338
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,190
你只需要别抱怨了。

1339
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,830
看看那个，哥哥。

1340
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
去容易。

1341
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,330
边上。

1342
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,530
呼！

1343
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,950
稳住，哥哥。

1344
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
瞧那个！

1345
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,340
耶。

1346
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,510
不会吧。

1347
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,750
是这里。

1348
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,910
是吗？你怎么这么肯定？

1349
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,460
这是他笔记本笔记本里最后参观的地方。

1350
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,930
以后的生活与他的痴迷第十三头骨。

1351
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,460
这些年来，

1352
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,630
我们最终会发现它。

1353
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,660
你先。

1354
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,600
你是考古学家。

1355
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,000
好了，你是冒险家。

1356
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,800
妻子会认为与该。

1357
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,140
她说，我是一个荣耀的导游。

1358
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,070
洙导游。

1359
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,570
好吧，哥哥。

1360
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,850
没有GPS所有我靠老地图。

1361
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,420
它的下跌这个洞穴另一对夫妇百米。

1362
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,160
你肯定爸爸在这里？

1363
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,090
他描述了这条隧道。

1364
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,100
我们都知道，

1365
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,800
什么是留给他的是躺在附近这儿的地方。

1366
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,480
我们应该为他找不管它是什么，他是后。

1367
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,270
你准备好了？

1368
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,610
我已经准备好了。

1369
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,810
你准备好了？

1370
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,610
我猜是。

1371
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,120
我们会没事的。

1372
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,390
如果你这么说，哥哥。

1373
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
你先。

1374
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,190
哈登A.G总部 
奥地利维也纳

1375
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,220
一切准备好了？

1376
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,030
是的，他们一直在等待着你的到来。

1377
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,090
什么问题？

1378
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,530
我呢？没有。

1379
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,610
家伙我得到这个从可能有不同的意见。

1380
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,690
为什么？

1381
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,840
我不认为你想知道的是，马洛里小姐。

1382
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,270
该实验室已建成八个级别的地下。

1383
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,570
你期待的麻烦？

1384
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,670
让我们希望不是。

1385
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,120
留神。

1386
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,250
这边。

1387
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
注意脚下。

1388
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
哎，

1389
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,580
看来，我们发现了一些东西。

1390
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,380
确实，不是吗？

1391
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,610
你先。

1392
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,820
老人优先。

1393
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
是他吗？

1394
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,540
你不认为他会错过这一刻，你呢？

1395
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,770
哈登先生？

1396
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,570
米切尔先生。

1397
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,970
<i>干得好</i>

1398
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
谢谢你，先生。

1399
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,020
我不知道还能活多久，

1400
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,060
所以我们不要再浪费时间了。

1401
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,390
正常吗？

1402
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,140
同时，据我们所知，

1403
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,670
这是第一次的头骨团聚

1404
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,140
人类历史上。

1405
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
发生了什么？

1406
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,640
有声波振动16赫兹。

1407
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,740
我觉得有些不舒服。

1408
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,550
我不知道他们是如何做的，

1409
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,020
但这些东西都产生自己的磁场。

1410
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,280
这是不可能的。

1411
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,710
告诉他们。

1412
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,290
什么好说的？

1413
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,430
周四晚上是女士之夜。

1414
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,500
所有的女人都会被录取，无盖。

1415
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,060
所有饮料2束缚。

1416
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,230
什么？

1417
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,530
我不知道。

1418
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,100
但他们在爸爸的书。

1419
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,540
12不同的符号。

1420
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,450
你怎么能知道，聪明的家伙。

1421
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,120
如果你不知道他们说什么。

1422
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,760
好吧，我并不需要能够把它们翻译。

1423
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,860
为了知道是阿卡迪亚，

1424
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,190
这是埃及，

1425
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,060
那些在这里我真的不认识。

1426
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,290
这一点，这看起来前哥伦布。

1427
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,400
最有可能的玛雅。

1428
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,340
南美？

1429
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,700
地狱的是这里做什么？

1430
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,070
正是。

1431
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,710
预巴比伦，苏美尔，我们已经得到了埃及，玛雅可能。

1432
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,480
我的猜测是它的十二个不同的组。

1433
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,680
代表不同的早期文明。

1434
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,790
有啥第十三呢？

1435
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
我的意思是，你已经有了12组符号，

1436
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,990
12文明古国，12头骨。

1437
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,690
如果真的有第十三个头骨，

1438
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,850
那是什么呢？

1439
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,430
是，我的朋友，是一个很好的问题。

1440
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,400
我真的不知道在这一点上，

1441
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,030
但我敢肯定，我会找到了。

1442
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,940
我想我会呕吐！

1443
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,910
是的，它的频率。

1444
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,750
某些调制引起恶心。

1445
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,950
七赫兹，它可能会导致你的身体来分开。

1446
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,220
在核级。

1447
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,620
已关闭的规模！

1448
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
我们会失去它。清理房间。

1449
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
清理房间！

1450
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,070
让他们离开那里！

1451
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,300
我们试图激活关闭

1452
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,170
只是做我告诉你！

1453
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
哇。

1454
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,490
你摸了什么？

1455
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,570
没！我什么都没做！

1456
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,940
我告诉你不要碰任何东西！

1457
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
哇。

1458
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
北约空军基地 
萨拉戈萨,西班牙

1459
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,550
红色代码。

1460
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,200
上校，脉冲消散。

1461
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,240
我们有一个核爆炸的任何报告？

1462
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,390
消极的，先生。

1463
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,030
什么？

1464
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
没有，先生。

1465
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:14,860
没有。

1466
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,100
卫星或地震。

1467
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,110
那么到底是什么呢？

1468
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,680
我们挑upan电磁爆，

1469
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,340
而且似乎它起源于维也纳。

1470
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
维也纳？

1471
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,880
奥地利维也纳？

1472
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,540
作为莫扎特和巧克力？

1473
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,680
这是正确的，先生。

1474
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
好吧。

1475
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,390
手表的指挥官，把我们带回了黄色。

1476
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
是的，先生。

1477
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,350
电磁脉冲不只是凭空出现的。

1478
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,630
了解，先生。

1479
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
主要。

1480
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,010
告诉参谋长联席会议他们会知道那是什么，当我知道这是什么。

1481
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,670
这一切恢复正常，除了。

1482
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,740
头骨仍产生一个字段。

1483
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
正是。

1484
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,400
他们保持稳定的时刻，按钮

1485
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
你看到发生了什么。

1486
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,640
是的，当然。

1487
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,280
好了，我们知道，头骨具有独特的磁性特质。

1488
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,220
如果你的理论是正确的，第十三应该有─

1489
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,450
本来应该能够控制他人。

1490
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,720
理论是没有问题的。

1491
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,760
的问题是，这不是第十三颅骨。

1492
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,630
你不是在责怪我，他的公鸡了，是吗？

1493
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,030
到底谁应该去责备这个不折不扣的灾难，

1494
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,130
先生。米切尔？

1495
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,740
先生。 hadden-

1496
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:00,040
你担保的真实性，你发表了伪造。

1497
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,950
先生。哈登，我真的很抱歉，但我的老本行。

1498
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,420
人有一种倾向，说谎。

1499
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,020
是这样的，先生。米切尔？

1500
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,520
我本来打算由您的联系人所提供的资料，先生。

1501
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,150
是的，你应该审核这些信息，对吗？

1502
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,850
是的，先生。

1503
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,760
你可能已经和审讯的第一章。

1504
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,800
谁给你的，但是这将是太困难的，

1505
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,230
不是吗？

1506
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,130
是的，先生。

1507
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,180
每个人都会犯错。

1508
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,950
谢谢你，哈登先生。

1509
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,350
永远不要犯同一个错误。

1510
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,650
是的，先生。

1511
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,790
去找真正的头骨。

1512
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,690
和他一起去。

1513
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,430
没多少时间了。

1514
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,710
我想这死了的两个男人的家庭。

1515
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,540
得到妥善照顾。

1516
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
是的，先生。

1517
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,880
一个奇怪的电子干扰。

1518
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,480
昨晚震动了奥地利维也纳。

1519
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,990
与停电。

1520
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,990
市中心有一次大爆炸。

1521
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,820
目前，驻法国的北约部队。

1522
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
处于高度戒备状态。

1523
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,430
BMP

1524
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,050
任一个城市或政府官员的任何单词。

1525
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,700
对此拒绝置评。

1526
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,200
政府官员是什么造成了这种。

1527
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,540
引爆原子武器。

1528
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,040
似乎是一个高调的会议。

1529
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,300
与总统。

1530
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,240
我是梅拉妮·考克斯，维也纳在线，和我们呆在一起。

1531
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
哇。

1532
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
酷。

1533
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,620
小心你碰的，它会杀了你。

1534
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,540
对不起，兄弟。

1535
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,960
这是爸爸的戒指。

1536
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,290
你是对的。

1537
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
不，不，不要去碰它！

1538
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,040
什么也我只是告诉你吗？

1539
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,660
我没有碰任何东西！

1540
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,370
对不起，对不起

1541
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,670
让我们在这里了！

1542
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,980
去！

1543
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,250
快点，约翰！

1544
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,700
好的，来吧。

1545
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,110
夹在。

1546
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,610
你呢？

1547
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,320
- 所有设置。- 确定。

1548
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
遥控器。

1549
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,630
松弛超出。

1550
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
来吧。

1551
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
怎么了？

1552
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,970
它不工作。

1553
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,170
没有。

1554
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,440
给我你的，我们会一起去。

1555
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,570
夹在。

1556
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,770
来吧，来吧！

1557
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
对不起。

1558
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
在那里，你在做什么？

1559
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,380
特里！

1560
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,920
对不起，哥哥。

1561
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,390
我们能做到这一点起来，加油！

1562
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,860
特里，不这样做！

1563
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,360
这是唯一的办法。

1564
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,520
对不起。

1565
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
特里！

1566
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,030
我爱你，男人。

1567
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,540
特里！

1568
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,830
我哥哥总是陪伴着我。

1569
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,370
尽管他并不总是相信。

1570
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,700
我在做什么。

1571
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,500
我想这就是我会最想念他的。

1572
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,150
LUH 。

1573
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,460
我要感谢大家的光临今天。

1574
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
和你付尊重。

1575
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,600
这将意味着很多我的兄弟。

1576
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,620
谢谢。

1577
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,730
妈妈，我想念我的爸爸。

1578
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,910
我知道你想念你的爸爸，亲爱的。

1579
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,480
我想念你的爸爸，太。

1580
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,680
如果有什么以往任何时候都需要，

1581
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,450
你问你的叔叔约翰，好不好？

1582
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,620
好吧，叔叔约翰。

1583
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,790
我猜它运行在家庭。

1584
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,620
那是什么？

1585
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,540
没有身体，没有棺材。

1586
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,600
劳拉，我很抱歉。

1587
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,640
我。

1588
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,180
这不是你的错。

1589
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,150
他是我的小兄弟。

1590
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,550
我应该保护他。他没有跟我。

1591
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,280
他抬头看向你。

1592
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,220
他会跟着你的任何地方。

1593
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,010
- 温斯顿教授？ - 不是现在，拜托。

1594
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,750
- 你好，教授温斯顿。 - 女士。

1595
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,320
你介意告诉我这是什么？

1596
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,060
它像什么？

1597
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,270
它看起来像我的课被取消了。

1598
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,830
这就是它说，是的。

1599
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,730
你会关心澄清？

1600
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,870
我不明白为什么。

1601
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,470
我想你的兄弟去世后。

1602
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,540
你可能需要一些时间。

1603
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,170
嗯。

1604
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,510
不，我不需要时间。

1605
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,810
我只是需要找回我的教学。

1606
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,120
它不是想象中的那么容易，约翰。

1607
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,620
你是部门负责人，格里。

1608
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,930
你为什么不只是让那么容易吗？

1609
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,190
我是谁必须回答的部门负责人。

1610
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,530
该学院的院长，

1611
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,690
谁又将有回答董事会。

1612
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,000
又哪里受托人必须做任何这样？

1613
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,330
你是谁告诉这些孩子之一。

1614
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,870
一些神离弃水晶头骨的故事。

1615
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,640
杰拉德，你现在跟我开玩笑吧？

1616
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,540
它只是一个理论。

1617
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,670
你和我都知道，。

1618
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,440
这是正确的，理论。

1619
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,480
这不正是我们试图在这里做？

1620
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,610
帮助孩子为自己着想？

1621
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,120
学校最大的捐助者之一反对。

1622
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,450
我的双手被缚。

1623
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,760
所以现在的捐助者决定的课程？

1624
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,870
他们要拉资金，约翰。

1625
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,430
所有的资金。

1626
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,670
我们谈论50教师职位。

1627
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,700
好吧，好吧。

1628
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,470
告诉我是谁。

1629
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,110
<i>我会告诉他们，也许我可以说服他们，如─</i>

1630
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,570
没有，有没有说服他们。

1631
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,870
他们的想法是由。

1632
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,180
你是一个世界级的考古学家约翰，

1633
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,910
和罚款的学术。

1634
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,620
你必须知道，这样的事情。

1635
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,780
会赶上你迟早。

1636
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,020
约翰。我真的很遗憾。

1637
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,390
我也是。

1638
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,410
他一直在那里很长一段时间。

1639
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,620
给它一个几分钟。

1640
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,620
又过了几分钟，我们将有一个血淋淋的大腿舞。

1641
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,290
好吧，这就是它。

1642
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,060
离开它的任何时间更长，他将绝对砸了。

1643
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,200
看到光明的一面。你可以随身携带他出去。

1644
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,740
我不会让他扔了我的新衣服。

1645
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
来吧。

1646
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,460
如果你有一支笔，我就签给你。

1647
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,440
如果你是幸运的，哪天它会是值得的东西。

1648
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,510
实际上，你的雇主非常感兴趣。

1649
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,900
与您讨论吧。

1650
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,070
好吧，

1651
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,520
什么是他或她的名字？我会做出来给他 -

1652
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,520
威廉·哈登。

1653
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,350
H-A-D-D-E-N 。

1654
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,800
威廉·哈登？

1655
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,330
非常富有的技术家伙？

1656
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,440
是啊，这会是一个。

1657
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,500
现在什么，他想与我的书？

1658
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,840
不是你的书，队友。

1659
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
你。

1660
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,170
我呢？

1661
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,620
让我们只说对他有很深的那一刻，

1662
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,150
个人兴趣在题材。

1663
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,060
好了，也许你应该告诉先生。哈登。

1664
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,530
他是稍微误导。

1665
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,300
水晶头骨是一个理论。

1666
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,200
显然不是一个非常好的。

1667
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,040
<i>哦，我的'。</i>

1668
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,330
那么，如果我们告诉你。

1669
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,410
这是一个有点不仅仅是一个理论。

1670
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,670
我想说的是，你们需要再喝一杯。

1671
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,410
并通过你们我的意思是我。

1672
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,610
请。

1673
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,650
这是我。

1674
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,900
是的，他们都在里面，现在。

1675
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,460
我明白我的使命。

1676
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,640
他们不会获得第十三头骨。

1677
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,780
这听起来像你要我作出声明。

1678
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,410
精。

1679
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,610
它将被处理这样。

1680
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,940
所以我想你不会要我签书？

1681
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,470
先生。哈登愿意陪我们到维也纳。

1682
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,880
他想和你谈谈本人对头骨。

1683
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
维也纳听起来可爱。

1684
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,190
但不幸的是我有一些同学，

1685
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,820
讲座参加到。

1686
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,090
真的吗？

1687
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,160
因为我们听说你已经被赋予了休假。

1688
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,560
从你的教学义务。

1689
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,830
哦，你听说过吗？

1690
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,200
先生。哈登是一个减轻你。

1691
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,670
这些义务。

1692
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
现在，他为什么还要那样做？

1693
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,440
他有更大的鱼鱼苗，不是吗？

1694
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,300
他要你来维也纳。

1695
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,500
讨论你和你父亲的一生的工作。

1696
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,570
他认为这将是更好，如果他有你的。

1697
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,580
让他出来！

1698
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,620
上楼梯！去！

1699
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,730
谁是这家伙，为什么他在你拍摄的？

1700
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,310
他没有拍摄我，他瞄准了你！

1701
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,530
他是什么？

1702
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,640
第十三头骨仍然在那里。

1703
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,740
还有人谁愿意做任何事情来阻止它。

1704
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,900
从被发现。

1705
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,470
包括像那家伙的狂热分子。

1706
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,180
那么，如果哈登希望我一心一意，

1707
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,820
他肯定现在有吧。

1708
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,580
走，走！

1709
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,110
我想在维也纳脉冲更新。

1710
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,840
还是有电磁信号。

1711
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,640
从位置，先生正在生成。

1712
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,940
什么是源？

1713
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,210
没有办法告诉没有，先生。

1714
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,280
信号强度保持稳定，

1715
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,610
散热的迹象。

1716
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,750
所以他们仍然能够产生另一个脉冲的？

1717
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
是的，上校。

1718
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
如果第二个越强，

1719
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,160
他们可以欧洲黑掉一半。

1720
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,360
在维也纳地上通知地方当局。

1721
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,860
我想组装在15分钟内上垫一个围棋队。

1722
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,140
需要多少时间？

1723
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,450
我们降落在希思罗机场，然后我们会在菜刀。

1724
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,740
在最后一站到维也纳。

1725
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
菜刀？

1726
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,950
我还挺喜欢的喷气。

1727
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,690
在EMP一阵几乎降至每架飞机从天空。

1728
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,550
维也纳左右，所以，为了我们自己的保护，

1729
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,790
我们切换到旅游的一种形式。

1730
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,160
这是有点不太岌岌可危。

1731
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,260
少岌岌可危？

1732
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,820
放下你的武器！

1733
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,800
把'时间了！现在！

1734
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,490
去左边。

1735
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,230
感动！

1736
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,640
你休息的人，对我。

1737
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,090
这是远远不够的，上校。

1738
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,880
命令你的手下，放下他们的武器。

1739
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,420
放下你的武器，先生。

1740
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,820
这是一种私有财产，因此。

1741
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,950
你无权进入该设施。

1742
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,250
真的吗？

1743
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,580
我是美国陆军指挥北约部队。

1744
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,260
我已经得到了权威的该死的空袭打电话。

1745
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,930
在这栋楼，如果我想。

1746
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,700
你真的想要走这条道路？

1747
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,680
你洛迪克，儿子。

1748
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,910
告诉你的导师把他们的武器下来。

1749
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,950
没有人会受到伤害。

1750
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,450
好吧。

1751
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,560
因此，谁负责这个设施的？

1752
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,300
这将是我。

1753
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,510
上校贝利，我承担？

1754
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,610
我很害怕，先生，

1755
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,830
有将是指令的变化。

1756
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,570
这是一个私人研究机构。

1757
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,310
由哈登企业全资，

1758
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,280
这是我所全资拥有的私人公司，。

1759
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,750
它是什么，先生。哈登，

1760
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,550
是未经授权的电磁脉冲的部位。

1761
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,320
我对北约授权。

1762
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,520
抓住这一独资设施的控制。

1763
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,160
直到我知道这到底是发生在这里。

1764
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,360
我将提出正式投诉与欧盟。

1765
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,070
你这样做，先生。

1766
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,470
直到我听到，否则，先生。哈登，

1767
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,930
有一个在城里有一个新警长。

1768
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,150
所以这是最好的一个亿万富翁。

1769
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,810
能想出，是吧？

1770
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,950
一个古老的军事风格的直升机？

1771
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,590
它们具有少得多的电子，这使得它们更安全飞行。

1772
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
当你有问题，EMP 。

1773
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,470
这是非常令人欣慰。

1774
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,340
西耶娜，我想知道。

1775
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,030
什么是霍顿的痴迷与水晶头骨？

1776
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,100
你要问他关于那个。

1777
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,310
如果我有机会，我会。

1778
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,590
我们已经分手的消息在这里。

1779
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,550
它刚刚被证实，所述电。

1780
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,150
骚乱导致近停电。

1781
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,850
在西欧那样，其实中心。

1782
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,620
从哈登行业研究机构。

1783
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,190
。你可能还记得，哈登行业的老板。

1784
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,670
是亿万富翁，威廉二世。哈登，

1785
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,900
一个人谁最近震惊华尔街。

1786
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,840
当他决定卖掉他的所有美国利益的。

1787
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,130
追求欧洲项目。

1788
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,510
。你可能还记得，隐藏的工具是一样的设施。

1789
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,550
与EMP爆炸了涂黑有关。

1790
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,170
大多数西欧。

1791
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,580
我们正在等待一份官方声明和评论。

1792
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,480
从哈登的代表，

1793
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,080
鉴于事件的性质，

1794
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,990
上究竟发生了什么。

1795
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
这是怎么回事？

1796
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
磁场生长。

1797
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,350
比前一个更快？

1798
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,490
指数。

1799
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,470
到底是什么呢？

1800
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,400
还有，我们可以做些什么来控制反应没有。

1801
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,630
它打破。

1802
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,430
可有人请解释什么，我在看什么？

1803
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,740
这些来自世界各地聚集12水晶头骨，

1804
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,480
汇集首次。

1805
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,680
在神的名字是什么，你说什么？

1806
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,520
我告诉你，那里将是另一个。

1807
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,610
电磁脉冲，比第1大。

1808
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,450
这些水晶头骨产生的？

1809
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,580
是的。

1810
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,460
并没有什么我们可以做些什么来阻止它。

1811
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,830
嗯，我要去停止它。

1812
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,630
武器自由，摧毁头骨。

1813
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,900
上校，没有。

1814
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
上校，拜托了！

1815
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,030
你不知道你在做什么！

1816
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,770
火！

1817
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,760
啊！ ！

1818
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
这到底是什么？

1819
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,900
某种电子脉冲油炸我们。

1820
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,500
我认为，这个老菜刀保护呢？

1821
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,340
导航系统有保护，

1822
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,040
但燃油泵，去年进行了更新。

1823
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,780
你没有想到，当我们需要一把菜刀。

1824
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,820
与预售电子，即可能是一个问题？

1825
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
我们有没有权力？

1826
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:43,690
我们在直升机。

1827
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,350
我们将要坠落，像一块石头从天上。

1828
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,960
不，不，不。

1829
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,460
我们可以自动旋转。

1830
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,390
自动什么？

1831
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,430
菜刀就像飞机。

1832
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,460
在上面的行为一样，除了一个巨大的机翼的锯片。

1833
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,800
我们必须开始跳水，使这项工作，

1834
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,300
这是一个非常糟糕的地方，自动旋转和土地。

1835
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,400
我们需要重新路由的电源，燃油泵。

1836
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,240
以及如何地狱我们要做到这一点？ ！

1837
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,190
好了，我们可以想办法回到那里。

1838
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,510
你知道如何做到这一点？

1839
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,540
我们要找出其中的燃油泵。

1840
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,650
多久，我们得到了，直到我们必须把这个东西了吗？

1841
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,220
以这样的速度的下降，也许另一个两分钟，

1842
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,480
但我们将不得不硬着陆。

1843
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,960
在山的一侧。

1844
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,450
我发现了一个精灵。

1845
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,620
电力电缆。

1846
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,360
我发现他们在这里。

1847
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,590
燃油泵是在那里。

1848
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,960
把它放到这了这里，看。

1849
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,220
这些燃料线在这里？

1850
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
是啊。

1851
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,680
我们不会以清除山脉！

1852
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,470
我的工作是让这两个人回来，

1853
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,700
我们不抛弃！

1854
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,630
得到它了？

1855
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,980
我们已经得到了发动机的动力又回来了！

1856
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,090
是的，不错！

1857
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,880
这是真棒！

1858
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,750
出色的工作，教授，优秀的！

1859
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,980
我觉得他醒来。

1860
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,150
不错的工作，你救贫混蛋。

1861
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,590
我们得到的菜刀起来！

1862
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,830
差不太多，如果我这样说我自己！

1863
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,740
不，不，不，不！

1864
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,430
哦，这只是辉煌，血腥的辉煌！

1865
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,270
无气！

1866
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,070
你不装燃油发电机？

1867
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,740
对不起，先生。

1868
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,040
我闭嘴！

1869
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,210
我需要你-

1870
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,010
我要感谢你邀请我这个小小的冒险。

1871
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:45,700
Professor-

1872
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,470
移动。动，动了！ ！

1873
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,890
你还好吗？

1874
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,560
这是一个很好的方式，在欧洲到达。

1875
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,190
是啊，你别客气，教授。

1876
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,130
现在我们已经找到交通工具前往维也纳。

1877
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,810
什么是地狱刚刚发生了什么？

1878
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,610
你试图消灭他们。

1879
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,310
有没有办法将其删除或销毁。

1880
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,060
你现在明白了，上校？

1881
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,530
我们仍然在线，先生。哈登。

1882
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,990
检查冗余系统。

1883
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
先生，

1884
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,670
我是从直升机上接收信号。

1885
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,070
运送医生马洛里和温斯顿。

1886
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,330
什么样的信号？

1887
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,630
紧急灯塔。

1888
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,100
菜刀下跌。

1889
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,470
是否有任何伤亡？

1890
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,170
任何伤害？

1891
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:56,940
不知道，先生。

1892
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
该死！

1893
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,150
他们一定的权利，通过脉冲飞行。

1894
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,920
坐上了失事地点的位置。

1895
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:02,620
是的，先生。

1896
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,190
谁是这个菜刀？

1897
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,380
西耶娜·马洛里，我的高级研究员，

1898
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,260
和约翰·温斯顿。

1899
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,260
温斯顿？教授约翰·温斯顿？

1900
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,560
是的，上校。

1901
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,160
他可能只是谁也阻止不了这个唯一一个。

1902
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,460
但目前我只关注。

1903
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,260
是怀念马洛里的幸福。

1904
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,810
我只是失去了四名士兵，先生。哈登。

1905
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,340
我不是特别关心你的个人decadences 。

1906
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,620
西耶娜·马洛里是我的女儿，上校。

1907
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,080
所以请，

1908
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,860
使用你有什么资源，在您的处置。

1909
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,550
并让他们在这里尽快。

1910
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,690
给我的男人的坐标，我会送回收队伍。

1911
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,850
是的，先生。

1912
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,790
先生。哈登，对不起。

1913
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,640
我是一个父亲，以及。

1914
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,060
谢谢你，上校。

1915
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,400
道歉接受。

1916
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,970
上校！你必须看到这个！

1917
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,920
我刚在柏林的地方八国集团成员。

1918
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,480
现在收集了什么似乎是一个紧急会议。

1919
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,220
对于这些奇怪的天气现象。

1920
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,830
这似乎增加了每小时。

1921
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,460
这样的天气phenomenahas现在已经达到临界质量。

1922
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,130
你可以看到，它现在已经成为一个巨大的漩涡！

1923
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,030
我刚刚收到突发新闻，军事单位。

1924
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,510
现在已经转移到城市，以协助疏散。

1925
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,370
现在报道说。

1926
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,180
一个闪电风暴两倍大小。

1927
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,410
在过去的24小时，

1928
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,140
和巨旋涡现在席卷全市。

1929
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,780
但随着旋涡越飘过欧洲，

1930
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,220
我认为每个人的嘴唇问题是。

1931
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,660
我们在哪里避难？

1932
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,620
这是什么？

1933
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,860
如果我是对的，这是结束的开始。

1934
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,260
不要采取这种错误的方式，

1935
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,000
但我希望上帝你错了。

1936
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,350
先生。哈登，我们别无选择。

1937
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,710
我们必须遏制实验室和破坏头骨。

1938
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,550
那是不可能的，上校。

1939
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,010
我们不能坐在这里什么都不做！

1940
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
爸爸！

1941
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,050
我以为我已经失去了你！

1942
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,030
教授约翰·温斯顿，

1943
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,690
我想你见见威廉·哈登。

1944
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:03,490
我的父亲。

1945
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
先生。哈登。

1946
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,630
教授，我是你的父亲是一个伟大的崇拜者，

1947
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,870
因为我是你自己。

1948
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,700
这是上校贝利。

1949
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,470
贝利。

1950
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,370
教授。

1951
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,480
我很欣赏的客气话，

1952
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,340
我不符合我的父亲很多球迷。

1953
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,520
除了边缘群体和狂人。

1954
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,710
好了，我希望我没有。

1955
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,350
之前，我失去了我的腿脚，

1956
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,550
这是在那里我做了我最好的思想。

1957
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,350
所以，如果你不介意的话，我们应该一起走？

1958
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,820
我不介意，如果你不介意的话解释给我。

1959
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,960
它究竟是什么，我在这里做。

1960
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,800
我是一个非常富有的人，医生温斯顿。

1961
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,860
我一直在为我一生中最。

1962
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,130
但是，我担心我的傲慢已经得到了我的好。

1963
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,300
在目前所发生的事情光。

1964
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,510
我会把它作为简单的，我可以。

1965
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:56,490
你在这里，医生温斯顿，因为我快死。

1966
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,230
我一直在与癌症作斗争了十年。

1967
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,540
在我的追求治愈的，

1968
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,070
我才知道水晶头骨。

1969
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,870
并开始收购这些。

1970
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,100
所有的人，但第十三。

1971
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
是的。

1972
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,280
第一个被发现在南美洲，

1973
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,340
接着是三个其他 -

1974
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,470
原谅我打断了，先生，

1975
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,570
据我所知，历史上。

1976
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,740
但所有的头骨已被证明是一个欺诈，

1977
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,920
碳定年测试了他们没有老。

1978
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,750
超过200或300年。

1979
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,950
相信我，我们有我们的失败。

1980
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,590
没有一个完美的。

1981
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,560
让我们只说测试是有些犯罪嫌疑人。

1982
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,620
怀疑？

1983
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,630
你在说什么？

1984
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,470
碳定年是改变以某种方式？

1985
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,960
你得到了十二种不同的头骨。

1986
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,440
来自世界各个不同地区？

1987
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:52,440
哈登行业拥有。

1988
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,670
六个最大的碳年代测定设施。

1989
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,740
所以测试是假的？

1990
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,510
让我们只说我们有证据更高的标准。

1991
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,340
啊，对吧。

1992
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,550
你欺骗了整个科学界。

1993
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,450
我们所做的是softenthe收购价格。

1994
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,350
把他们赶走馆内陈列。

1995
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,620
先生。哈登可以成为亿万富翁，

1996
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,320
但每个人都有自己的价格。

1997
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,620
右，右。

1998
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,490
所以它的钱。

1999
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,600
我们谈论放在一起。

2000
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,760
12世界上最珍贵的对象。

2001
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,470
什么，如果真不会发生。

2002
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
成为众矢之的。

2003
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,600
先生。哈登，我不知道是什么含义是。

2004
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,000
你改变这些试验中，

2005
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,240
但我想它涉及监狱。

2006
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,040
我要死了，上校。

2007
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,270
是啊，好了，你还没死。

2008
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,210
Ok了，坚持住，坚持住，坚持。

2009
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,610
没有这个，现在真正重要的。

2010
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,550
头骨是真实的。

2011
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,590
所以他们多大？

2012
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,460
他们大多是过时大约50万年前。

2013
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,460
别人无法日期。

2014
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,900
50万年？

2015
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,360
那人早。

2016
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,260
这意味着一些其他来源。

2017
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,130
也许是外星人？

2018
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,300
先生。哈登，我不知道，如果你的碳约会有心计。

2019
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,500
已导致这场灾难，

2020
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,970
但我知道，我还有一个问题。

2021
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,410
防止全球的端。

2022
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,240
你和我有同样的目标，上校。

2023
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:05,970
上校！

2024
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,110
够了！

2025
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,950
现在，如果你和教授温斯顿能拿出一个解决方案，

2026
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,150
我所有的耳朵。

2027
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,720
但现在我必须赋予北约。

2028
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,810
并拿出我们自己的方法。

2029
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,520
蛮力将无法正常工作！

2030
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,490
你所看到的happenedwhen你的人试图。

2031
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,790
攻击的头骨！

2032
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,690
他们有一个坚不可摧的领域身边！

2033
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,360
那是四个人。

2034
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,730
我说的是一些药更强。

2035
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,600
我们知道强行将不起作用。

2036
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,030
会是怎样？

2037
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,470
第十三头骨。

2038
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,370
但困境是。

2039
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,450
我不知道从哪里开始寻找它。

2040
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,950
我想你跟着你父亲的脚步。

2041
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,110
并发现它。

2042
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,150
满足你的命运。

2043
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,150
先生。 hadden-

2044
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,750
我的资源，每一个人。

2045
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,360
将在您的处置。

2046
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,390
上帝知道我创造了这个灾难。

2047
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,530
如果非要用我的财富每一位来阻止它，

2048
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,620
这样吧。

2049
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,540
有一件事，我们没有一个有很大的。

2050
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,300
而那会是什么？

2051
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,740
时间。

2052
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,180
所以我该承担这个菜刀是比上一个更安全？

2053
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,550
这是冷战技术。

2054
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,590
它的建成能够承受核爆炸。

2055
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,290
所以你为什么不告诉我，哈登是你的父亲吗？

2056
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,960
和破坏的惊喜呢？

2057
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,900
你知道，我们有很多共同点，教授。

2058
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
真的吗？

2059
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,370
那是什么？

2060
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,870
我们俩度过了我们的生活努力走出阴影。

2061
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,070
我们的父辈。

2062
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,950
是什么马洛里是？

2063
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,610
这是我母亲的娘家姓。

2064
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,220
她去世时，我是一个小女孩。

2065
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,230
将它作出了区别，如果你已经知道我是谁吗？

2066
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:05,030
什么，我多么认真了吗？

2067
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,840
或者多么诱人我还以为你是当我们第一次见面？

2068
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
认真？

2069
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,910
所以，你呃。

2070
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,380
一直等到你的直升机拿到一个女孩独自。

2071
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,510
您胸围之前这样的行了呢？

2072
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,710
不，我通常等待，看看是否这个女孩我打的。

2073
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,550
是亿万富翁的女儿。

2074
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,850
哦，肯定。

2075
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,290
那么我想这是一个耻辱。

2076
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,290
我继承被关押在生前信托。

2077
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,820
啊。

2078
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,100
所以我们要去哪里？

2079
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,280
你爸爸告诉我，在我父亲的后尘。

2080
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,510
这就是我在做什么。

2081
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,480
第十三头骨是在哪儿？

2082
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,550
不，这是我的父亲来到了最后的地方。

2083
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,270
他消失前。

2084
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,140
这是唯一的办法了吗？

2085
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,480
恐怕是。

2086
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,390
准备好了吗？

2087
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,650
我们在这里。

2088
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,660
方便，易于。

2089
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,260
我得雅。

2090
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,540
这是有趣的。

2091
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,140
什么？

2092
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,580
因为我在这里与特里，

2093
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,080
我发现这个洞穴已经崩溃。

2094
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
非常好？

2095
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,450
不，如果我们需要另一条出路。

2096
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,860
或者我们可能避免这整个极限运动例行。

2097
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,690
是的，脂肪的机会。来吧。

2098
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,640
你是怎么得到你父亲的笔记本电脑。

2099
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,510
如果他们从来没有发现自己的身体？

2100
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,640
这是送给我在一所大学在那里我教。

2101
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,410
你的父亲在我面前解雇。

2102
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,580
OK，很好，没有解释是谁发送给你。

2103
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,780
你不知道？

2104
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,260
这是你的父亲。

2105
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,700
他送出一记随之。

2106
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,460
他说，他的研究人员的一个发现它。

2107
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,870
远征，他觉得或许有一天。

2108
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,410
我会觉得有用。

2109
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,580
所以这是最后的地方你的父亲是？

2110
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,740
这是在那里他们发现了笔记本电脑？

2111
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,110
我倾向于同意你的。

2112
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,750
但如果我父亲的研究小组已经在这里了。

2113
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,750
他们没有找到第十三头骨，

2114
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,220
我们为什么在这里？

2115
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,320
持此，请。

2116
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,790
这是我的父亲来到了最后的地方。

2117
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,630
在我的弟弟失去了他的生活。

2118
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,430
和我打赌，答案还在这里。

2119
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,540
我们只需要知道去哪里找吧。

2120
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,120
对不起，先生们。

2121
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,550
它是什么？

2122
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,390
头骨都产生了非常集中的磁场。

2123
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,460
它开始于隔离腔。

2124
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,900
并伸出超出公用线。

2125
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:06,230
这是分隔地球大气层行。

2126
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,430
来自外太空。

2127
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,460
我知道它是什么。

2128
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:13,530
似乎现在向后延伸到地球的核心。

2129
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,740
什么是地狱做所有的意思是，先生。哈登？

2130
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,280
这意味着，现在有一个新的领域。

2131
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,610
与现有的1竞争。

2132
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,580
好了，所以现在给我一个坏消息。

2133
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,660
火山与地震活动，

2134
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,500
和良好的可能性，即地球的地壳铁。

2135
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,040
会开裂就像一个鸡蛋，

2136
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:46,740
如果这种情况发生全球将有字面上撕裂。

2137
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,640
而好消息吗？

2138
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,580
先生。普里查德。

2139
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,220
以目前的速度，SAR，大约30小时。

2140
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,350
- 发出疏散令。 - 是的，先生。

2141
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,520
在30小时，

2142
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,180
我授权使用的战术。

2143
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,390
核武器在这个网站。

2144
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,290
我会汽化那些神抛弃的东西。

2145
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,030
回到地方是，他们从来到。

2146
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,230
你所看到的所发生的当你的人试图。

2147
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,060
消灭他们！

2148
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,600
这是四名士兵，先生。哈登。

2149
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,430
我说的是力量尚未释放。

2150
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,840
自广岛。

2151
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,910
你要成为结束世界的男人。

2152
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,080
也许它保存。

2153
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:43,990
你还好吗？

2154
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,690
嗯

2155
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,330
这边。

2156
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,420
做好。

2157
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,890
- 你还好吗？ - 是啊。

2158
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,370
约翰？

2159
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,640
看。

2160
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,750
约翰，你还好吗？

2161
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:48,950
是啊。

2162
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,720
是啊，我很好。

2163
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,090
这是给你的，我的兄弟。

2164
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,540
我们已经准备好提取。

2165
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,550
继续。

2166
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,120
来吧！

2167
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,370
我们得离开这个地方！

2168
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,070
是的，没有开玩笑。

2169
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,300
来吧。

2170
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,610
我很高兴，这是我们后面。

2171
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,800
我们不需要这些了。

2172
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,990
好。

2173
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,470
这里，让我帮你。

2174
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,940
好了，这边。

2175
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,510
我们走 ，来吧。

2176
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,820
直升机怎么了？

2177
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,940
有人拍下来。

2178
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,520
谁？

2179
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,780
我不知道。

2180
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:26,020
大概谁开枪我在酒吧同一个人。

2181
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,420
他们加强它一个或两个档次。

2182
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,650
仔细。

2183
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,500
啊！

2184
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,350
你在干什么？那真痛啊！

2185
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,550
米切尔，你到底在这做什么？

2186
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,810
哦，现在来吧。

2187
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,940
你真的没有想到先生。哈登。

2188
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,010
打算让你在欧洲中途拖曳。

2189
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,240
他珍爱的小女孩。

2190
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,450
有没有人让你的眼睛，是不是？

2191
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,050
直升机怎么了？

2192
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,200
有人用导弹把它打下来了。

2193
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,560
有人似乎有意杀害我。

2194
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,690
你能想到谁？

2195
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,500
宗教狂热分子，边缘群体，

2196
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,260
- 白人至上主义者，中央情报局。 - 好吧，好吧。

2197
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,200
你知道，我所知道的是，在我遇见你。

2198
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,780
我不知道，怎么会有人想要杀我。

2199
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,310
我是一个十分讨人喜欢的那种人。

2200
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,710
所以你说。你听着，

2201
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,240
你想站在这儿，谈谈。

2202
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,680
谁是在你的刺客，

2203
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,010
或者你想获得地狱离开这里。

2204
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,380
他们的工作之前，你是不是在菜刀。

2205
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,540
他们击落？

2206
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,480
是啊，这就是我想。

2207
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,310
我想要一个EMP-屏蔽铜缆站在。

2208
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,530
拉我们其余的人离开这里到时候。

2209
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,110
是的，长官。

2210
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,410
他们将在这里。

2211
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,540
我希望你是对的。

2212
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,320
每个人的缘故。

2213
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,260
因为我不想名垂青史。

2214
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,190
因为谁授权的核装置的引爆的人。

2215
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,550
拯救世界。

2216
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,860
那就不要做了，上校。

2217
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,890
这是从我手中。

2218
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,510
我们应该把这些灯出来，并杀死加热器。

2219
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,880
它会吸引了错误样的公司，

2220
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,780
如果你知道我的意思。

2221
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,010
是啊，我冷，我们需要光算出这个。

2222
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,210
好，那你还不如送了一个信号弹。

2223
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,520
并告诉谁是我们后，我们都。

2224
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,220
也许你应该拿出你吸烟，廉价雪茄。

2225
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,730
气味会吸引了错误的那种人。

2226
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,160
这是一个科伊巴。

2227
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,700
哦，还有完善的。

2228
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,360
在这种情况下，我会只吸引了。

2229
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,490
<i>最好的一种恐怖分子和刺客。</i>

2230
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,930
此外，这就是为什么我们有你在这里。

2231
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,730
保护我们。

2232
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,600
是啊，我不能保护你自己。

2233
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,500
它不是在这里。

2234
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,530
它必须是。

2235
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,580
是啊，我还看不出来，我累了。

2236
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:13,520
也许我们应该抓住几个睡眠时间。

2237
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,780
重新开始。

2238
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,520
太阳将高达很快。

2239
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,960
但是，如果我们不破解这个也没什么关系。

2240
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,760
如何我们该怎么离开这里没有菜刀，米切尔？

2241
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,900
我不会把另外一只小鸟在该地区。

2242
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,470
直到我们确保它。

2243
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,500
现在听，教授。

2244
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,610
你需要专注于拯救世界。

2245
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,900
我需要散散心，所以我能思考。

2246
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,380
去给他一只手。

2247
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,420
你看到了吗？

2248
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,490
看什么？

2249
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,060
有。

2250
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,500
有啊！

2251
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,500
我知道我会找到它。

2252
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,640
让我告诉你它在哪里。

2253
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,550
有你们两个想通了？

2254
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,410
是的，也许。

2255
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,710
我需要报告的时间。哈登和上校。

2256
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,550
如果你已经破解这个还是不。

2257
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,020
这不是地图，这是地方。

2258
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,520
这些，这些是地图。

2259
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,720
我不跟着你。

2260
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,260
他们是明星。

2261
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,230
此图显示的确切位置找到。

2262
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,600
第十三头骨。

2263
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,710
我还以为你会兴奋。

2264
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,510
好了，在洞穴寺庙必须是3000多年的历史。

2265
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:44,670
我说更像是5 。

2266
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,040
哦，甚至更好的。

2267
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,380
所以我们要做的就是想通了。

2268
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,470
其中，该星座出现。

2269
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,480
在夜空中在5000年前？

2270
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,610
嗯，这很容易。

2271
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,010
你知道，我知道，为了让我们两个。

2272
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,960
弄明白这将需要数月，甚至更长的时间。

2273
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,720
但对于你爸的超级计算机之一。

2274
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,490
它应该是小菜一碟。

2275
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,650
正确的。

2276
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,440
好吧，

2277
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:21,140
输入偏角和推断。

2278
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,890
哦，等等，我们已经得到的东西。

2279
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,660
你们两个是作品。

2280
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,000
对了，你想知道的星座出现。

2281
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,330
在夜空中在5000年前？

2282
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:48,310
嗯，其实5302个月11天。

2283
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:49,980
有你的答案。

2284
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,840
这到底是什么？

2285
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,350
它的维索科山谷，这是理论上的一个金字塔。

2286
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,610
这是我们要去的地方。

2287
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:10,330
太阳金字塔

2288
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,330
有趣的是它如何保持未开发。

2289
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:18,600
千百年来。

2290
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:22,110
人们认为这是一个自然形成的很长一段时间。

2291
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,420
哦，我的父亲说，军方把时钟上我们。

2292
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:31,910
我们有六个小时。

2293
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,510
我希望米切尔世界末日前回来。

2294
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,530
和他出去想租一辆车。

2295
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,380
真的吗？

2296
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,490
这是一个有趣的选择。

2297
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,640
这是我们的人，这是我们的人！

2298
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,690
哦男孩。

2299
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,710
你为世界上最富有的人工作。

2300
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,110
竟然租到最好的车是这样的？

2301
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:02,080
好了，对不起，王牌先生，但他们没有用信用卡。

2302
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,280
这是所有我能得到的现金，我不得不。

2303
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,990
好了，让我们去哪儿？

2304
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,210
是这样吗？

2305
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,400
你到底在期待，米切尔？吉萨？

2306
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,600
好了，我不知道，也许更大的东西比？

2307
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,660
它只是看起来像一个奇怪形状的小山。

2308
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,270
好了，这是一个金字塔。

2309
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,900
是啊，我知道，教授Smarty的裤。

2310
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,340
我要说它看起来并不像一个地方。

2311
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,180
将持有的关键，拯救世界。

2312
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:28,910
我看到。

2313
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,950
你期望什么样子？

2314
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,320
好了，好了，所以有什么计划？

2315
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,880
我们要保持低调，

2316
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:37,010
远离村庄，直到天黑，

2317
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,550
然后去好和安静。

2318
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,530
这个计划听起来强如在汽车的选择。

2319
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:45,650
坐进车内。

2320
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,940
我的天啊，还能再小吗？

2321
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,700
哪里是每个人？

2322
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,030
我怎么会知道？

2323
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,310
一个镇民大会，脱衣舞俱乐部？

2324
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,040
脱衣舞俱乐部？

2325
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,240
这些都是很好的人。

2326
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,970
你永远不知道。

2327
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,490
村庄都需要一个良好的脱衣舞俱乐部。

2328
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,290
你不早说？

2329
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,930
好吧，我想我们都知道，每个人都。

2330
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:27,500
我们得出去。

2331
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,800
- 这会过去，给它时间。 - 看看你身后。

2332
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,200
哦，拍。

2333
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,300
出去。

2334
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,210
只是充当普通。

2335
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:49,650
不要东张西望。

2336
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:50,660
还没有反应过来。

2337
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,800
不要让他们知道我们被跟踪。

2338
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,620
但我们被跟踪，所以我们怎么行动？

2339
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,620
休闲。

2340
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:57,430
究竟有多少？

2341
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,300
还有我们两个的后面，两个在我们面前。

2342
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,200
刚转身打成一片。

2343
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,030
好的

2344
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:14,380
他们在做什么？

2345
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,020
我以前见过你。

2346
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,550
是的。

2347
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,090
我也见过你。

2348
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,560
现在，恐怕这将是我们最后一次见面。

2349
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:08,400
是，一些委婉的说法，因为你要杀死我们？

2350
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,530
放松，西耶娜。

2351
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:10,830
不对抗的人。

2352
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,410
他有一把剑。

2353
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,530
是的，这位教授有一个点。

2354
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:20,880
去，享受你的玩笑，因为它会现在都结束。

2355
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,360
它是什么，你呢？

2356
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,180
你知道我们是后。

2357
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,180
你一直跟着我们。

2358
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,720
是的。

2359
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,590
这是我们的工作，保护第13个。

2360
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,220
头骨。

2361
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,700
他们拥有不可思议的力量，当他们汇聚。

2362
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,010
一些你父亲做了。

2363
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:50,940
你死之前，我想问问你。

2364
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,280
你一旦发现你以为会发生什么。

2365
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,580
你求？

2366
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:58,750
我们需要它阻止

2367
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,150
阻止什么？

2368
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,880
你不知道吗？

2369
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,620
12头骨所造成的破坏。

2370
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,820
正在汇聚。

2371
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,800
我们需要第十三阻止它。

2372
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:15,300
还有，如果一个人是愚蠢的，对这种力量。

2373
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,530
视如儿戏，

2374
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:20,040
那么他会自我毁灭。

2375
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:21,540
你不能拯救他们。

2376
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:23,770
现在准备。

2377
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,170
约翰！

2378
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,880
不用担心，看开点。

2379
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,750
它只会花一秒钟。

2380
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:32,710
住手！

2381
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,390
给我的剑。

2382
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,500
你好，朱莉亚。

2383
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,540
爸爸？

2384
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,670
我们埋葬了你。

2385
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,510
我们以为你死了。

2386
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,610
对不起，儿子。

2387
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,420
我们找了你这么久，爸爸。

2388
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:09,960
然后我发现你的日记。

2389
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,190
我把它在一个地方，我知道它会被发现。

2390
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:15,020
我曾希望，如果你发现了它，它会给你一些答案。

2391
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,590
它给了我答案，但目前更多的问题。

2392
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,430
它基本上是什么让我在这里。

2393
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,530
发生了什么事，爸爸？

2394
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,440
你去哪儿？

2395
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:23,670
我知道你有很多的问题，

2396
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,240
你应该。

2397
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:29,770
我一直在第十三后头骨了这么多年，

2398
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,550
我来了这么近，

2399
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:36,510
然后我发现这个地方和兄弟会。

2400
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,350
这是兄弟会的最后一个据点。

2401
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,350
它守住我们最后的秘密。

2402
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:43,650
什么样的秘密？

2403
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,390
我发现头骨，约翰。

2404
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,430
它是真实的，就像我一直都知道这将是！

2405
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:51,190
他们给了我一个选择。

2406
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,630
我可以死，

2407
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,920
或者我可以加入与他们。

2408
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,200
在保护头骨的秘密。

2409
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:02,370
我已经寻找了这么久，什么也不在乎。

2410
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,380
显然你不在乎你的家人。

2411
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,580
你的选择导致你儿子死亡。

2412
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,560
泰利步你的后尘。

2413
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:21,390
我爱你和你的兄弟比你永远不会知道，

2414
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,560
但是这是我无法拒绝的。

2415
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,100
一切后，我看到了，一切我已经学会了。

2416
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,640
这是不是一种选择，这是我的命运。

2417
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:37,300
也许你的命运，可以善加利用。

2418
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,520
世界第十三头骨，爸爸。

2419
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,550
你知道他们永远不会让你拥有它。

2420
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,020
不要让泰利无谓的牺牲！

2421
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:51,120
没有头骨，数十亿就会死亡。

2422
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,250
如果头骨已聚集，

2423
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:58,360
和世界末日已经开始，就这样吧。

2424
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,900
这是人的命运。

2425
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,130
人类的命运骑在你的肩膀。

2426
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,680
你明白，他们不能永远离开这个地方，现在。

2427
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,940
是的，我知道。

2428
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,880
我只要求没有看。

2429
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:15,480
是的，我们不希望你心烦。

2430
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:18,420
看你最后一个儿子被杀害你的命运！

2431
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,850
你会杀了我们这里，在金字塔？

2432
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,120
你有没有荣誉？

2433
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,320
女人，不跟我说话这个样子！

2434
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,690
我已经花了我的一生捍卫荣誉这个地方。

2435
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,390
从未有纪念那些谁杀了，侯赛因！

2436
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:39,110
对不起，老朋友。

2437
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,180
跟着我，这边！

2438
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,460
没有，先生，该中队在空中待命。

2439
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,240
磁场是95％，先生。

2440
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,890
这一次，我们让所有人都离开这里。

2441
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:22,710
上校，你的炸弹不会丢你认为他们会。

2442
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,940
只要给他们更多的时间。

2443
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,460
我给他们尽可能多的时间。

2444
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:34,020
在那之后，我下命令。

2445
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:34,960
谢谢。

2446
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,030
如果我们每个人都生活那么久再感谢我。

2447
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,630
我们得离开这里。

2448
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,620
米切尔，叫上我爸爸。

2449
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,650
爸爸，你在做什么？

2450
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,460
这个地方是我的生命，约翰。

2451
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,490
我无处可去。

2452
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,590
让我死在这里。

2453
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:46,570
对兄弟会所做的我不值得活。

2454
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,830
你在说什么？

2455
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:51,340
现在你有不同的生活，

2456
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,870
你已经有了一个孙女！

2457
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:53,870
我有一个孙女？

2458
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,340
没错！泰利的女儿！她马上7岁了！

2459
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,300
真的吗？ 是的！

2460
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:03,940
爸爸！

2461
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,450
对不起，儿子。

2462
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,580
爸爸，不！

2463
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,590
来吧，我们必须去。

2464
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,170
约翰，加油！现在！

2465
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,860
- 爸爸！ - 来吧，约翰，现在！

2466
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,700
主席先生，磁场达到100％。

2467
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,070
我怕你的人都出来的时候，先生。哈登。

2468
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,100
阿尔法中队，时间目标？

2469
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,530
复制。

2470
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,400
8分钟。

2471
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,510
我们必须让每个人都出在一个安全的最小距离。

2472
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,480
前引爆。

2473
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:11,610
你听说过他们，他们是在他们的途中！

2474
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,600
我已经给了他们足够的时间，我可以，先生。哈登。

2475
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,160
我们不能再等下去了。

2476
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,250
- 我们在这里完成。 - 是的，先生。

2477
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,480
爸爸！

2478
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:20,860
我告诉你，他们会做吧。

2479
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,760
我不是回顾炸弹。

2480
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,460
直到我敢肯定这件事情的作品。

2481
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,870
让我们这样做之前，为时已晚。

2482
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,690
西装应该保护你从光。

2483
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:46,210
它限制你接触到的任何电离辐射，

2484
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,620
但我不能做出任何承诺。

2485
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,220
我真的不知道发生了什么，

2486
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,760
但似乎漩涡正在消退。

2487
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,950
和风暴似乎即将结束！

2488
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,260
约翰。

2489
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:54,540
哦，谢谢。

2490
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,520
我认为，我们需要喝一杯。

2491
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:06,050
当我说我们我的意思是我。

2492
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,460
这是你的回合，教授。

2493
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,060
你怎么了，先生？

2494
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:14,190
叫我的医生。

2495
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:15,290
马上，先生。

2496
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,530
- 上校。 - 是吗？

2497
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,640
如果你能可能帮助我的东西。

2498
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:21,630
如果我可以。

2499
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,510
关键九基地，我们准备好了。

2500
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,570
好吧，密封腔。

2501
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,570
收到。

2502
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:19,780
结束了。

2503
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,390
现在怎么办？

2504
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,760
等下。

2505
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,340
她的父亲已经死了。

2506
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:46,910
西耶娜，我很抱歉。

2507
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:52,120
没关系，我想我知道这迟早要来。

2508
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,200
我只是不知道什么时候。

2509
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,220
我明白。

2510
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,800
我猜你做的，

2511
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:06,200
比其他人多。

2512
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:32,230
CMV刚刚得知神秘的亿万富翁。

2513
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,330
威廉·哈登已经去世。

2514
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,660
它不知道哈登先生确切死亡时间，

2515
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:39,210
但他的发言人说是上周某个时间。

2516
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,840
不是因为霍华德·休斯已经有这么多的奥秘。

2517
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,700
周围的亿万富翁死亡。
