不,这一次不一样.

是时候来点变化.真的.
It's time to make some changes, for real.

这不是我要的.我很满意我现在的生活.
You can miss me with that. I'm living my best life.

188
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,300
什么才算适合你呢,麦克?

独自死去,非常悲伤?

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,960
朋友,我没把所有的事都告诉你.
Nigga, I don't tell you all my business.

205
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,880
你只要知道我会一直追罪犯到100岁为止.
Look, all you need to know is that I'll be running downcriminals till I'm 100.

206
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,920
去医院之后你还敢说追人.

213

才没有.
Oh, hell, no.

214
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,650
没什么比老人缅怀过去更悲惨了.
Nothing sadder than old men revisiting the past.

215
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,070
别伸展.伸展算作弊.
Whoa, hey, no stretching.Stretching is cheating.

216
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,200

我赢,我们退休.
- I win, we lay it down.

220

我们申请退休.
We turn in our papersand we retire.

221
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,460
好,我赢的话,你不可再提这愚蠢的退休计划.
All right, well, when I win,you stop all this foolish retirement talk.

222
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,510

But these were subsonic5.7-by-28s, custom rounds.

这对我来说也算是私人恩怨.
This is personal for me too.

288
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,100
我们就用尽所有找他出来吧?

那个警察是个威胁.其他的根本不算什么!
The cop was a threat. The others are nothing!

295
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,460
你到底听不听我的?
Do you listen to me or not?

296
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,960
我希望他看到其他人死.
I wanted him to see the others die.

297

赶快完成任务.

01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,730
我看过了布克可疑的财务报告.
I ran a suspiciousfinancial report on Booker.

969
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:49,400
他所有的冒名公司都用同一个会计.
All his LLC frontshave the same accountant.

970
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:52,490
注册会计师皮卡特詹金斯.
Picante Jenkins, CPA.

971
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,030
是的.这里没几个皮卡特.
Yep. You don't meettoo many Picantes.

972
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,670
我们敲门询问就是了.
So we just gonna doa knock-and-talk?

973
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,630
是的.
Yeah.

974
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,800
那是什么?
Whoa! What the hellis all that?

975
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:12,760
你在说什么?
What you talking about?

976
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,010
麦克,你不需要榴弹发射器.
Mike, you don't needa grenade launcher.

977
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,510
是的,但我要一个.
Yeah, but I want one.

978
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,730
他是个会计,麦克.
He's an accountant, Mike.

979
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,230
看,麦克.我们不能够那样进去.
Look, Mike, we're notgoing in there like that.

980
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,310
例如怎么样?
- Like what?- Hey, look, all our lives,

981
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,150
我们一生都是坏男孩对吧?
we've been bad boys, all right?

982
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,070
现在是做好人的时候.
Now it's time to be good men.

983
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,950
谁要唱那首歌?
Who in the hellwanna sing that song?

984
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:37,160
好人,好人,你该怎么办?
 ? Good men,good men What you gonna do? ?

985
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,080
也许你真心的唱,它会爆红.
Well, maybe if you sang the song like you meant it,

986
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,580
-搞什么?-不.
it'd catch on.Nah.

987
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,920
敲门再询问.
Knock and talk.

988
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,550
是.敲门.
Yeah. Knock, knock.

989
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,720
麦克.
- Mike! Mike!

990
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,680
迈阿密警察.趴下!
- Miami PD! Get down!

991
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,300
发生什么事?
- What is happening?

992
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,930
说好的敲门询问呢?
What happened to knock and talk?

993
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,810
你弄坏了我的门.
Hey, you broke my door.You broke my door!

994
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,810
先生,对你的门感到抱歉,好吗?
Sir, sorry aboutthe door, okay?

995
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,640
一些万能胶应该可以修好.
A little Gorilla Gluewill make that just fine.

996
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,020
你的搜查证呢?
- Hey, where's your warrant?- I need you on your knees

997
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,570
我要你跪下,双手在脑后.
with your hands behindyour head right now!

998
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,450
先生,如果你继续动,我会开枪.
Sir, if you keep moving, I'mgonna shoot you in your face.

999
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,320
-不,他不会的.-我会开枪.
- No, he's not.- Yes, I am!

1000
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:20,040
麦克.那人是个会计.我们只需要和他谈.
Mike, the man is an accountant.We just need to talk to him.

1001
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,330
你想和一个正嗑药…
So you wanna havea conversation with a coked-outorange mountain?

1002
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:26,250
-这是最新的…数据.-巨人谈?
Here's the latest figures.

1003
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:28,880
让我来处理,好吗?你支援就好.
Look, let me handle this, okay?Just back up.

1004
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:32,760
我要用我的心穿透这个人的灵魂.
I'm gonna penetratethis man's soul with my heart.

1005
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,090
-什么?-是.
What?Yeah.

1006
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:37,220
看着学习吧.
Watch and learn.

1007
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:42,020
我要狠狠地打你.
Hey! Hey, ass licker.I'm gonna fast-foodfist-fuck you.

1008
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:44,390
先生,那很不好.
Sir, that's just nasty.

1009
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:48,060
现在我知道这情况复杂.
Now, I recognize that thisis a difficult situation.

1010
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,150
别过来.
- Don't come over here.- Don't go over there, Marcus.

1011
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,650
别过去,马克斯.
We just needyour client's receipts.

1012
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,820
我们只需要你客户的单据.

1013
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,030
什么?
- What?- Booker Grassie.

1014
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,150
布克格拉西.任何记录…
- Any record of...?- Unh!

1015
01:02:58,740 --> 01:02:59,670
Mm.

1016
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,250
你以为你穿透他的灵魂多深了?
Hey. How deep you thinkyou got in his soul?

1017
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:08,290
有时必须为做正确的事而痛苦.
Sometime you gotta sufferfor what is right.

1018
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,880
够了,马克斯.
Don't you turnthat other cheek.

1019
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,380
-放开我!-好.
- Get off me!- All right.

1020
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:17,090
先生,我知道你很害怕.
Now, sir, I realizethat you're scared.

1021
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:20,640
我们都很害怕.有时,恐惧只是…
Hell, we all scared.You know, sometimes fear just...

1022
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:31,110
你觉得呢?
So, what you thinking?

1023
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,570
我觉得这个由你处理.
I think you shouldhandle this one.

1024
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,450
我同意.
Yeah, me too.

1025
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,530
喂!
Hey!

1026
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,790
马丁路德退下了.现在是马尔科姆兄.
MLK just tapped out.You got Brother Malcolm now.

1027
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,870
必要时我们可以用任何方法处理.
We can handle thisby any means necessary.

1028
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,120
我认得你.你是那个被枪杀的警察.
I recognize you.You're that cop that got shot.

1029
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,540
今年不是你的好年.
Bad year you're having,Butterscotch.

1030
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,460
如果你没带枪和警徽,我会揍你.
If you didn't have that gunand badge, I'd fucking eat you.

1031
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,170
等等,这就是阻挡你揍我的唯一东西?
This the only thing that'skeeping you from eating me?

1032
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,300
是的.
- Yeah.- Oh.

1033
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,050
放马过来吧.
Bring it, big boy.

1034
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,190
左边安全了.
- Left line clear!

1035
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,190
上铐.
- Cuff him.

1036
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,150
你们在这里干什么?
What the hellare y'all doing here?

1037
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:15,190
我叫了他们来.
I called them.

1038
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:20,200
什么?说好的最后一次的坏男孩呢?
What? What happened to bad boysone last time?

1039
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:24,330
这是最后一次了.但这是新的安排,麦克.
This is one last time.But this here's the remix, Mike.

1040
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,040
我们和AMMO合作.
We work with AMMO now.

1041
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,920
别扯了好吗?
That's that shit, okay?

1042
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,670
在我咬掉它之前,你有三秒的时间.
You got three secondsbefore I bite it off.

1043
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,170
把你的手指移开.
Get your damn fingerout my face.

1044
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,420
那么,告诉我们.
RITA: So tell us.

1045
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,010
法官,检察官,刑事线人,上尉和你.
Judge, prosecutor, criminal informant,the captain, and you.

1046
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,470
你们有什么共同点?
Who do you have in common?

1047
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,720
数以百计的调查,行动.Hundreds of investigations,operations...

1048
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,890
所有受害者中有847起案件.
Eight hundredand forty-seven cases in the nexus of the victims.

1049
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:52,060
谁要杀你?
Well, who up therewants to kill you?

1050
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,360
谁不要呢?
- Hell, who doesn't?- All right.

1051
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,230
现在只是考量罪犯而已.
That just the criminalsthat we're looking at.

1052
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:58,650
我不相信一个不想杀他的人.
I don't trust a personthat don't wanna kill him.

1053
01:04:58,790 --> 01:04:59,990
不然把我的名字也加上去.
- Hell, put my name up there.- Thanks. Got it. Appreciate it.

1054
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,910
谢谢.我们可以了,马克斯.感谢你.
What you getout of the accountant?

1055
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,320
你从那会计那里问到什么?
- His records are a mess.- Surprising.

1056
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,450
他的记录一团糟.

1057
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:05,530
想不到.
But I did manageto get into his Keychain.

1058
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,370
但是我确实设法进入他的密码管理系统.

1059
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,080
-然后呢?-他所有的社交媒体.
- So?- All of his social.

1060
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:12,500
看.
Look

1061
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,960
很多不堪入眼的照片但没有线索.
Looking at a lot of dick pics but not so many clues.

1062
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,670
适用于我们系统中任何人的面部记录.
Facial rec for anyonein our system.

1063
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:19,630
好的.
On it.

1064
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,510
那是我中枪的前三天.
That's three daysbefore I got hit.

1065
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,640
回到之前的照片.那项链.
Hey, go back to that last shot.The chain.

1066
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:28,220
是,放大.
MARCUS:Yeah, zoom in.

1067
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:31,810
-杰-罗.-杰-罗.
- Heh. Zway-Lo.- Zway-Lo.

1068
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:32,850
谁是杰-罗?
- Who's Zway-Lo?

1069
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:34,860
洛伦佐罗德里格斯.
- Lorenzo Rodriguez.

1070
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,440
被称为杰-罗.
Goes by Zway-Lo.

1071
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:40,240
在他成为流氓前我曾是他的教练.
Used to coach himin peewee hoops before he wentfor that thug shit.

1072
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,950
他是好球手,但在总冠军赛时不得不替补他.
Great player, but I had to benchhim during the championship.

1073
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,410
你在冠军赛上替补十岁球员吗?
You benched a 10-year-oldin the championship?

1074
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,700
是的.那小混蛋叫我笨蛋.
Yeah. Little fuckercalled me a dickhead.

1075
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,040
-但你们最后不是赢了吗?-才没有.他是我的明星选手.
- Did y'all win at least?- Hell, no.He was our star player.

1076
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:54,210
我们输了40分,但他得到教训了.
We lost by 40,but I made my point.

1077
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,290
好,这是团队运动.
Okay, there's no "I" in "team."

1078
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,790
你真的很笨.
There is one in "dickhead"though.

1079
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:58,750
闭嘴.
Man, shut up.

1080
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:01,970
看,杰-罗涉足毒品,武器.
Look, Zway-Lo'sinto drugs, weapons.

1081
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,800
他是塔霖的副手之一.
He's oneof Taglin's lieutenants.

1082
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,510
塔霖在麦克中枪那晚被发现死了.
Taglin was found deadthe same night Mike got shot.

1083
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:09,060
也许现在他是其他人的副手了.
MARCUS: I guess he's someoneelse's lieutenant now.

1084
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,520
洛伦佐罗德里格斯.
DORN:Lorenzo Rodriguez.

1085
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:13,350
无抵押贷款,连银行账户都没有.
No mortgage,not even a bank account.

1086
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,020
但明天是他的生日.
But it is his birthday tomorrow.

1087
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,150
如果他有庆祝的话,像他那样的只有三个地方可去.
If he's celebrating, there'sthree spots for a cat like that.

1088
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,570
迪托.冰45.吉联.
Ditto, Ice 45, Zillion.

1089
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,400
你能不能进入他们的俱乐部记录?
Can you get intotheir club records?

1090
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:27,870
冰45真的该提升他们的网络安全.
Pfft, Ice 45 should really uptheir cyber security.

1091
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,830
好.冰45.
Okay. Ice 45.

1092
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,870
迪托.
Ditto. Zillion.

1093
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:34,410

01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,460
那个.罗德里格斯.
There. Rodriguez.

1095
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:39,250
派对在今晚.
- Bam!- The party's tonight.

1096
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,670
在吉联.
Zillion it is.

1097
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:47,890
好,我们穿便衣晚上11点俱乐部见,穿上你最好的.
All right,we meet at the club at 2300,UC, so wear your Sunday best.

1098
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:50,640
这是抓人.我们进去,出去.不杀人.
This is a grab. We're in.We're out. No bodies.

1099
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,810
这次抄查绝对不用子弹.
This raid is strictly nonlethal.

1100
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,390
不用子弹.
Nonlethal.

1101
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:58,150

麦克,但这案和你无关.

1427
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:25,980
我的名字没在记录.
My name wasn't on it.

1428
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,280
因为我的身份被藏得好.

1439
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,730
我们坠入爱河.

1440
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,360
你是说你唯一一次…

伊莎贝尔阿雷塔斯.就那一次.

我本想脱离整个行动.
And I was gonna ghostthe whole operation.

1444
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,080
我和伊莎贝尔打算一起逃跑.
Me and Isabel were gonnarun away with each other.

1445
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,960
是什么让你改变主意?
What made you change your mind?

1446
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:25,790
他们称她为拉布鲁亚.
They call her La Bruja.

1447
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,040
女巫.
The Witch.

1448
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:32,010
她对巫术有研究.
She is into some dark shit.

1449
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:34,380
圣慕尔特.
Santa Muerte.

1450
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:41,470
那女人是冷血杀手.
That woman was a stone-cold killer.

1451
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:47,310
我被逼把我所爱的女人送入牢过一生.
So I had to putthe woman I love behind barsfor the rest of her life.

1452
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:54,150
我一直都以职责为先.
Chose the badge, and I've beenchoosing it ever since.

1453
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,660
麦克,你和一个已婚女巫睡了?
Mike, you fuckeda married witch?

1454
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,160
我说了那么多,这就是你的反应?
So all the shit I just said,and that was your takeaway?

1455
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:09,420
不,太多要消化.你以为你了解某人,然后…
No, it's just a lot to digest.You thinkyou know somebody and...

1456
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:12,960
现在我明白你为何穿得像个毒贩.
Well, hell, now it explains whyyou dress like a drug dealer.

1457
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:16,090
你到底要不要听?
So you wanna hearthis shit or you don't?

1458
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,970
抱歉.但你不知道那是不是你儿子,麦克.
Sorry. But you don't knowthat's your son, Mike.

1459
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,100
你不知道那女人跟谁睡了.
You don't knowwho that witch was fucking.

1460
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,890

Benito Aretascouldn't have kids.

Isabel gave birth in prison,eight months after her arrest.

1462
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:31,020
"直到最后."
"Hasta el fuego."He said that to me

1463
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,690
我从直升机跳下时他对我说了这句话.
before I jumpedfrom the chopper.

1464
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:36,610
那是我和伊莎贝尔想出来的.
Me and Isabel made that up.

1465
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:39,820
那不是真正的西班牙语.是我们之间说的话.
It's not even real Spanish.It's some shitwe said to each other.

1466
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,990
意思是,我们会一直一起到死把我们分开.
It meant like, "We'll betogether until we burn."

- Nah, Mike.- Marcus, he's the right age.

1472
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:54,250
他的年龄刚好.
He's crazy like me.He's ruthless like me.

1473
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:55,550
他像我一样疯狂.

他像我一样狠.
He's fearless like me.

他是那个疯了的我.
He's the fucked-up me.

1477

不,麦克.你才是疯了的你.

1478
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:07,350
你过早下结论.知道吗?
You jumping to conclusions.All right?

1479
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:10,100
事情会恢复正常,你必须相信.
Shit's gonna work itself out.You gotta trust that.

1480
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,810
对.
Yeah...

1481
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:14,860
你说得对.
You're right.

1482
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:19,150
天啊.

01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,380

01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:38,650
那个地方很适合我.

1490
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,190
抱歉,先生.
Oh, excuse me, sir.

1491
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:42,910

让我过去.小心你的脚趾.

1493
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:46,780
小心你的脚趾.

1494
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,740
没事.来.
It's all right. There you go.

1495
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:52,210
不,马克斯.
No, Marcus.

1496
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:55,750
我不会让你独自一人执行自杀任务,迈克.
I'm not letting you go on a suicide missionalone, Mike.

1497
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:58,670
这是我的问题.
This is on me.

1498
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:01,800
我不会让任何人因为我的事而死.
I'm not letting anybody elseget killed dealing with my shit.

1499
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:04,180
麦克,她是个布鲁哈.
Mike, she's a bruja.

1500
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:07,140
她会融了你的眼睛.
She'll make your eyes meltinto your stupid-ass head.

1501
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,350
她会让你的小弟弟跌下来.
She'll make your dick fall off.

1502
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,430
我是说生殖器官.
I meant penis.

1503
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:15,100
但是你还是别多管闲事.
You should be mindingyour own business anyway.

1504
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:18,730
马克斯.请回家.
Marcus, please go home.

1505
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,690
我们生死与共.
We fly together.We die together.

1506
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:22,780
什么?
- What?- Oh, no.

1507
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:25,450
不.那只是我们平常说的.
That's just something we say.

1508
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,070
没事.那不是…
It's all good. It ain't...

1509
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,370
我可以看到那让你们有些…
Oh, I can see how thatgot y'all a little...

1511
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,040
你来自什么地方?

01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:36,920

1513

你见到他是会怎么办?
So, what you gonna dowhen you see him?

1514
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:43,800
你真的要把你儿子送进监牢?

1515
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:45,130
不.
No.

1516
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,800
我会杀了他.
I'm gonna kill him.

1517
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:51,470
杀他?你真的要杀你的亲生儿子,麦克?
Kill him?You really gonna killyour own son, Mike?

1518
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,390
我会把他放进尸袋.

抱歉.

你知道你会去地狱对吧?
You realizeyou will go to hell?

1522
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:09,240
我不相信地狱,马克斯.
- I don't believe in hell, Marcus.

1523
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:13,000
你相不相信不重要.你要杀自己的儿子.
- Well, it believes in you.I mean, killing your own son.

1524
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:17,080
兄弟,那是会吞噬你的罪.
Brother, that's a darknessthat swallows you whole.

1525
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:20,750
也许我已经被吞噬了.

我死过,记得吗?

我要解决这件事.
I'm ending this shit, man.

1528
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:33,060
我应该猜到他是你儿子.

1529
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:37,310
因为他打败你的方式,麦克.

That was a ass-whuppingstraight from thy own loins.

1531
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,440
不寻常的打败你.
A supernatural ass-whupping.

1532
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:45,490
好.
- Mm-mm.- Well...

我能不能做他的干爹?

1541
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,260
好,麦克.
Yeah. Yeah, okay, Mike.

1542
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:18,350
你怎么能不带套和一个女巫睡?
How you fuck a witchwithout a condom?

1543
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:21,440
把那东西包起来.
You wrap that shit up, man.

1544
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:23,270
我们必须换位.

1567
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,710
不,她一定想谈谈.

她不可能一个人来.

他们是卡特尔.她会有很多后备.

收着.

圣慕尔特在告诉我们一些事情.

AMMO?
- Fuck. AMMO?

1609
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:36,520
马克斯,请回应.
- Marcus, come in.

1610
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:38,980
他们在干扰我们.
- Shit.- They're jamming us.

1611

他们知道我们在这里.完了.

我连接不上.

现在只有我们.

你为何不告诉我我有一个儿子?
[IN SPANISH]Why didn't you tell me I had a son?

1616
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,290

照顾他.

1618
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:01,920
就如你照顾我一样?

1619
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:09,470
那本来是个惊喜.

我看见战术跑位.

其他入口点?

这里.冷气流可能是洗衣房的废气.

1626

你怎么能这样对我们的儿子?
How could you do thisto our son?

1627
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:34,290
我的儿子.
My son.

1628
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:35,710
他认为我是谁?
Who does he think I am?

1629
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,460
就是现在的你.

把枪放下.

-那是火的意思?-闭嘴.

不,我不闭嘴.不.

1645
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:30,220
不.麦克,整件事是因为缺乏沟通才发生.
Mike, it's lack of communicationthat got this shit fucked up.

1646
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:31,640
他有话要跟你说.

1647
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:33,640
你不会喜欢,但你必须听…
You ain't gonna like it,but you need to hear it.

1648
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,580
Oh, shit!

1649
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:07,550
麦克,他们正走向直升机.
MARCUS: Yo, Mike,they're moving up to the chopper!

1650
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:11,800
马克斯!

戴上你的眼镜!
- Put your glasses on!- What the hell was that?

1652
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:23,310
那是什么?丢得好烂.

麦克,小心!
