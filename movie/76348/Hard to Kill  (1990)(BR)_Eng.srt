1
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,945
Come on. Let's go, guys.
I'm missing the Oscars.

2
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,873
Hey, Mikey, la Luce, the light.

3
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,983
- Calabrese, nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

4
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,396
This is our friend I told you about.

5
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,319
Calabrese.

6
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,442
I know you.

7
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,035
Who are these other mystery guests?

8
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,126
Murder is a very
serious business, my friend.

9
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,753
And an expensive one.

10
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,169
You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

11
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,214
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

12
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,300
You can take that to the bank.

13
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,547
Slowly. Slowly.

14
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,925
And always with caution.

15
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,229
Listen. I want you to turn
Senator Caldwell into a memory.

16
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,933
I'm not waiting for him
to die of natural causes.

17
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,936
All I'm counseling is patience.

18
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,773
The man is public.
He's in the papers every day.

19
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,947
Next time I read about him,
it better be the obituaries.

20
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,949
Who are you?

21
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,289
Get out of the shadows.

22
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,869
Enough bullshit.

23
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:23,378
- Can you do this job or not?
- It'll be taken care of.

24
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,962
Gentlemen, enough bickering.
This is business.

25
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,171
I think we understand each other.

26
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,048
Then let's just stick to business.

27
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,720
It's a light plane.

28
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,143
A Lear P-61.

29
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,644
We want it to take off.
We don't want it to land.

30
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,480
What the...

31
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,163
You told me this dock was clean.

32
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,302
Mikey. Quit playing
with yourself back there.

33
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,854
- Get that bastard.
- Let's get out of here.

34
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,383
I don't want him to get an hour older.

35
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,753
He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.

36
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,765
No kidding.

37
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,472
And the winner is:

38
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,559
Ben Kingsley for Gandhi.

39
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,808
Amigo, are you deaf?

40
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,527
Storm on 3.

41
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,774
Thanks, Max.

42
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:13,897
Axel, line 3.

43
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,658
Throwing away dimes now?

44
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,866
This doesn't go out.
For your ears only.

45
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,247
What?

46
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,787
Calabrese.
I got his ass on film.

47
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,584
You're full of shit.

48
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:35,385
Him and his pet cockroach, Valero.
On film and audio, laying out a hit.

49
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,306
Two guys I couldn't
make. I think they'll come up on film.

50
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,844
I think this is the big one.
Our own little Academy Award.

51
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,849
It's good. Ready?

52
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,352
- Shoot.
- Listen, Carlito.

53
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,522
Nobody but us knows about this.

54
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,323
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

55
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,455
- How you doing tonight?
- What can I do for you?

56
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,700
Got any Champagne?

57
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,128
Right next to the caviar.

58
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,627
- That was funny.
- Great.

59
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,334
In the big cooler back there.

60
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,549
How come you're not watching
the Oscars tonight?

61
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,718
The Oscars?

62
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,014
Yeah, the Oscars.

63
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,595
I hate the Oscars.

64
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,435
You're not having a good time?

65
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,229
Who needs the goddamn movies?

66
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,146
I got a show in here every night.

67
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,061
You got horror, sex...

68
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,612
freaks, violence.

69
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,991
And I don't got to pay no 4 bucks.

70
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,658
You should film it.
Get your own show.

71
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,872
I'll be great in a porno.

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,003
Better dial 911.

73
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,173
You don't want to call 911.

74
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,130
Holy shit.

75
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,129
You remember me, viejo?

76
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,510
That's right.

77
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,221
You remember.

78
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,053
He grew some hair
since we last seen him.

79
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,266
Not a lot.

80
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,230
Where's the rug?

81
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,689
You know what I want.
G0 ahead.

82
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,233
Move.

83
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,524
That's my money.

84
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,278
Take my life savings.

85
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,873
Where's a cop when you need one?

86
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,452
They're out eating doughnuts.

87
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,713
I got half a mind to bash your...

88
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,183
Now you only got half a mind.

89
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,644
Take him out, man.

90
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,348
Let's go, hero.

91
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,605
That's it, right here.
What are you grinning at?

92
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,397
You know...

93
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,439
there's only four of you guys...

94
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,567
and you only have one shot left.

95
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,881
Go low, man.

96
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,751
Get the maricén, man.

97
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,597
What are you doing on the ground?

98
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,939
I'll out your heart out.

99
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,726
Yeah? Come and cut my heart out.

100
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,021
Come and cut my heart out.

101
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,814
Come on, punk.

102
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,994
I know what you're thinking.
Mine's bigger than yours.

103
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,786
It's not fair.

104
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,614
I'll throw it away.

105
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,953
What if I show you
what it's like to be a victim?

106
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,632
- Come on.
- You're fucking dead, man.

107
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,674
It's still not fair.
Okay, I'll get down on my knees.

108
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,342
Better?

109
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,553
Come get some.

110
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,560
Looks like you won the Oscar, Storm.

111
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,969
You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

112
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,217
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

113
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,507
You can take that to the bank.

114
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,009
I know that voice.

115
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,143
Is that you, honey?

116
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,354
Yeah, baby.

117
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,348
In the flesh.

118
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,240
What are you doing?
Come on.

119
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,333
I'm raiding the icebox.

120
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,037
I gave up my diet for Lent.

121
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,671
Champagne?

122
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,255
Does that put you in the mood?

123
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,599
Think this could do it?

124
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,144
I had to bribe him to go
to bed with six cookies...

125
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,195
and a glass of orange juice.

126
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,491
I wish I could sleep like that.

127
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,826
Maybe I can help you.

128
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,450
Is that for me, Dad?

129
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,286
You faker.

130
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,129
Here you go.

131
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,135
There you go.

132
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:56,308
- Did you say your prayers?
- I wanted to do them with you.

133
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,601
There's a trick to getting
what you want when you say prayers.

134
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,681
What, Daddy?

135
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,937
You ask for things for other people,
like your mom and Uncle O'Malley.

136
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,402
Then how do I get stuff for myself?

137
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,408
That's why God invented work.

138
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,696
Want to say a little prayer with me?
Come here.

139
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,870
Want to say your prayers?

140
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,204
Now I lay me down to sleep.

141
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:30,008
And we say together:
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

142
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,919
If I die before I wake...

143
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,131
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

144
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,258
Amen. Very good.

145
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,350
Good night, Dad.

146
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,898
- Good night.
- Good night, Mommy.

147
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,862
Sleep well, champ.

148
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,861
Here's to us.

149
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,546
I had a shitty day today.

150
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,804
There's blood on your shirt.

151
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,722
It's not my blood.

152
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,429
So you don't have to worry.

153
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,115
If people knew how sweet you are...

154
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,243
they'd never be scared of you.

155
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,910
I'm not scared of you.

156
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,125
Maybe you should be.

157
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,270
We'll try to squeeze it in.

158
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,272
I'm in a silly mood.

159
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,954
I love you.

160
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,247
I love you too.

161
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,434
I'm ready.

162
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,024
What?

163
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,698
Motherfuckers.

164
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,165
Mason.

165
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,050
Sweet dreams.

166
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,226
You don't get many chances here.

167
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,857
Apparently, Pattie said to Reagan,
"You'll love my fiancé.

168
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,895
He's a California guy
who meditates, eats brown rice...

169
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,903
and sleeps on a bed of nails."

170
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,735
Becker. Storm on 3.

171
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,500
I got the coke on the dresser.
Put yours in the nightstand.

172
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,592
I got it.

173
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,254
Fix his ass.

174
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,352
Got all the tapes?

175
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,767
A shitload. Hurry.

176
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,936
Just hurry.

177
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,107
Quentero. The kid.

178
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,024
Get that kid and kill him.

179
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,871
That fucking Storm.

180
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,796
Get your ass in the van
and stop complaining.

181
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,387
- What happened, Max?
- Another dead asshole. Let's go.

182
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,815
Assemblyman Trent,
when did you meet Mason Storm?

183
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,276
I've known him since...

184
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,895
Jesus Christ.

185
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,405
I was City Attorney...

186
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,820
and he was a young...

187
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,951
homicide detective.

188
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,654
We worked together...

189
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,830
We worked on several cases.

190
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,329
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

191
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,207
Assemblyman Vernon Trent...

192
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,423
distraught over the loss
of an officer he knew.

193
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,803
Terrible circumstances here
outside the emergency room...

194
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,178
and a calamity-filled mob scene
of policemen...

195
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,100
What makes people do this?

196
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,647
Would somebody please tell me that.

197
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,108
Hulland.

198
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,693
Captain Hulland.

199
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,118
- Coming through, please.
- Stand back, please.

200
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,199
Is he a national treasure?

201
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,873
Blood pressure's 70l40.

202
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,377
I get no pulse.

203
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,210
They always said Storm was superhuman.

204
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,380
Know why?
He was jacked up on coke.

205
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,473
I’ll tell you something.
He was the cleanest man I knew.

206
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,313
He had more honor than
this whole department.

207
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,524
If I ever hear you
talk that puke again...

208
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,902
I’ll put you where you belong.

209
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,317
What the fuck is L.A. doing here?

210
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,489
- Taking over the show.
- Bullshit.

211
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,068
This is Homicide, not Internal Affairs.

212
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,828
We got two cops down with
money and drugs all over.

213
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,327
This came from the commissioner.

214
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,538
Captain Hulland?

215
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,119
What?

216
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,625
Storm is dead.

217
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,136
O'Malley...

218
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,188
I know you and Storm were tight.

219
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,355
For what it's worth...

220
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,442
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,447
The most unstoppable
son of a bitch I ever knew.

222
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,454
He got stopped tonight.

223
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,804
Excuse me.
Are you with the police?

224
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,053
Lieutenant O'Malley.
What do you got?

225
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,177
A live cop is what I've got.

226
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,808
- What's happening?
- No comment. It's over.

227
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,438
We've got a pulse.

228
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,199
Your man's alive, lieutenant.

229
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,826
Who else knows he isn't dead?

230
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,737
Just the people in here.

231
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,989
I want to see each of them.

232
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,918
And no one else Comes in here
as of now. You got that?

233
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,338
Lieutenant, this is still a hospital.

234
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,674
I appreciate your problem.

235
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,015
But I'm acting under orders
of the police commissioner.

236
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,184
- I hope you can document that.
- I can and will.

237
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:07,271
Mason Storm's going to vanish,
and you’ll help make that happen.

238
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:12,606
Till he can give us some answers,
the deader he is, the safer he is.

239
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,704
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm in your Comer.

240
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,954
And you can take that to the bank.

241
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,566
The governor
appointed Assemblyman Trent...

242
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,400
to the Senate seat vacated by
the tragic death of Caldwell.

243
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:01,325
You inspire me to
work harder. I won't tolerate crime.

244
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,416
And you can take that to the bank.

245
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,844
It's 6 a.m.

246
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,311
Morning, Martha.

247
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,441
What do we got?
"inquiring minds want to know"?

248
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,813
Doctor Carlin's ordered
a glucose drip for Jimmy C.

249
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,734
Max's E.E.G. monitor's
developing a nice electronic hiccup.

250
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,443
Poor Max.

251
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,446
And your boyfriend turned his head.

252
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,038
He did?

253
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:49,790
I thought he was going to sit up.
I almost shit.

254
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,965
See you for a cup of tea
in a few minutes.

255
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,880
I knew it.

256
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,817
You moved your head today,
you little devil.

257
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,775
Let's see,
what can I do for you here?

258
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,990
Very nice.

259
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,414
Great.

260
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,289
I've got a little surprise for you.

261
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,003
Be right back.

262
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,678
Would you like a little pussy?

263
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,303
A little bitty pussy.
Look what I've got here.

264
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,270
John Doe, can you hear me?

265
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:03,155
I know my words are getting through.
I don't care what the doctors say.

266
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,828
I'm going to keep
talking to you today...

267
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,371
and tomorrow and the day after,
till you respond.

268
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,837
Besides, you've got so much to live for.

269
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,924
Please wake up.

270
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,546
Got to go see Jimmy C.

271
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,848
Bye.

272
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,666
Stupid machine.

273
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,673
Nurse.

274
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,466
Nurse.

275
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,052
Oh, my God.

276
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,432
We’ll run some tests.
Alert X-ray for a CAT scan.

277
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:37,059
Call the lab.
We need a complete blood work-up.

278
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,280
John Doe.

279
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,779
Here we are.

280
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,788
Internal Affairs.
Detective Sergeant Goodhart.

281
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,467
My name's Andrea
Stewart, from the Coma Research Center.

282
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,588
I'd like to speak to
Captain O'Malley, please.

283
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,215
What is this in regards to?

284
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,015
I have a John Doe coma patient,
code access 461-Zebra...

285
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,473
with instructions to notify
in case of change in condition.

286
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,478
What's the change?

287
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,320
The patient has come out
of a coma after seven years.

288
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,818
Nolan, get Hulland, quick.

289
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:37,623
I'm sorry, Captain O'Malley's
no longer with this division.

290
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,333
I’ll take the information.

291
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,753
And please,
Contact no one else on this matter.

292
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,418
It would be better
for the patient's welfare.

293
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,218
Ladies and
gentlemen, the President.

294
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,140
President Bush has
caught the public eye with his antics.

295
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,009
From throwing the first ball
on opening day...

296
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,263
to kissing a pig
for the farmers' affections.

297
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,524
George Bush is becoming
a real crowd-pleaser.

298
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,070
This is Andrew Louis
for Cable Hospital News.

299
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,279
What year is it?

300
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,708
- Try not to talk.
- What year is it?

301
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,661
It's 1990.

302
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,883
Your charts go back for seven years.

303
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,087
Do you have any recollection
of anything?

304
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,676
I remember everything.

305
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:43,313
You're the first patient
to Come out of a coma of this duration.

306
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,066
You’ll be famous.
You’ll be on the news.

307
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,314
Listen to me very carefully.

308
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,316
I'm a cop.

309
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,908
My wife and family were murdered.

310
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,411
That's how I got here.

311
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,915
If you don't get me out
of this hospital...

312
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,623
within an hour, we’ll both be dead.

313
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,206
You're my cutest patient,
but not my only one.

314
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,962
- You're making a mistake.
- I’ll be back.

315
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,336
No. Don't go.

316
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,682
How's it going, brother?

317
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,687
Who are you?

318
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:29,648
I'm Danny, the physical therapist.
I'm going to give you a massage.

319
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,605
- I’ll make you feel all right.
- Get the fuck out.

320
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,986
I’ll just take you down the hall.

321
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,197
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

322
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:43,791
Dr. Mathews,
call Coma Research, please.

323
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,286
Can I see your list of patients
in your coma care unit?

324
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,662
Yes, doctor.

325
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:57,839
Get me out. Thanks for the
massage, but get me out of here.

326
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,516
Just relax. You’ll get out
of here real soon, I promise.

327
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,767
- Morning, Sheri. How you doing?
- Morning. Good.

328
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,563
Thank you.

329
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,648
Thank you.

330
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,366
- You know that doctor?
- No.

331
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,917
John Doe.

332
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,518
Excuse me.

333
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,016
Doctor?

334
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,275
I have to check everyone
on these floors.

335
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,107
Can I get your ID, please?

336
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,327
You can't have too much security.

337
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,547
If you feel up to it, I’ll get you some
lemon chiffon pie out of the freezer.

338
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,210
Get me out of here.

339
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,626
Don't worry.
I’ll take good care of you.

340
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,428
If you want, I’ll hook you up
with some pizza.

341
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,843
You got to learn to relax.

342
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,471
Orderly.
Give me a little help.

343
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,978
Give me some help down here.

344
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,860
What's he doing down there?

345
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,896
What's wrong?

346
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,823
Russ.

347
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,532
What happened?

348
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,488
He's dead.

349
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,204
My poor back.

350
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,460
You son of a bitch.

351
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,971
Storm, you son of a bitch.

352
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,240
Oh, my God.

353
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,250
Russ. Danny.

354
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,615
I’ll get you, Storm.

355
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,727
J.D.

356
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,483
Oh, my God.

357
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,653
Now will you listen to me?

358
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,154
Hold tight.

359
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,410
Sorry.

360
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,579
Stop.

361
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,164
Hang on.

362
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,086
Watch out.

363
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,413
Get out of the way.

364
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,695
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to put a stop to it...

365
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,830
and we're going to start right here.

366
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,124
We are going to put an end...

367
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:32,334
to violence in this state.
And you can take that to the bank.

368
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,717
Hulland, plaster Storm's ass
with slime in the press.

369
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:44,013
Make him responsible for that
hospital mess. Tail people he knows.

370
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,847
We know how to do our job.

371
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,852
Then show me. I'm starring in the
son of a bitch's home movies.

372
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,480
If that crap gets out,
I'm looking at 30 years.

373
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,075
Geraldo.

374
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,411
Who's this guy?

375
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,548
Our program came to an
unexpectedly violent conclusion.

376
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,939
Are you crazy?
I can't Come in to work.

377
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,106
I can't even go
to my apartment, Martha.

378
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,107
People are dead.

379
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,000
Then where are you?

380
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,079
I can't tell you. Besides,
you're better off not knowing.

381
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,792
Senator Vernon
Trent promises no new taxes.

382
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,798
And you can take that to the bank.

383
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,759
What'll I do with this guy?
I want to help him...

384
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,892
but he's all over TV.
He's a crooked cop involved in...

385
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,393
Why are you out of bed?

386
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,860
I've got you.

387
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,983
Police speculate that Storm...

388
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:03,368
who is known to have ties
with criminal elements...

389
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,495
could have involved
his contacts in his escape.

390
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,166
Storm was thought to have been
a murder victim. A casualty...

391
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,370
of his own greed.
A widespread search is now being...

392
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,094
This is Mason Storm. I'd like
to speak with Jerry Dunphy.

393
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,183
No, it's not a joke.

394
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,515
We can't stay here.
They'll trace us from the hospital.

395
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,394
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm house-sitting.

396
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,529
It belongs to a friend of my parents.

397
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,525
He's in China on
research for six months.

398
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,153
The medical center
only has my apartment address.

399
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,452
Not even my friends have this number.

400
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,835
You've got to believe me.

401
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,333
You're safe here, okay?

402
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,545
This reporter was
contacted personally by the "Coma Cop

403
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,513
"fugitive officer Mason Storm...

404
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,842
who, until days ago,
had been in a seven-year coma.

405
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:13,893
Storm said he's innocent of charges
made against him in the press...

406
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,732
and that he has
indisputable proof of this.

407
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,733
He has promised me a first look
at his alleged proof.

408
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,734
I want 24-hour surveillance
on that son of a bitch...

409
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,448
and those two nurses
from the hospital.

410
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,215
No, I can do it myself.

411
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,255
You do it then.

412
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,104
You give me this beard?

413
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,108
You tried.

414
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,797
- You ever been to Chinatown?
- Yeah. Why?

415
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:27,053
This is a list of herbs and needles
that I need for my recovery.

416
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,639
Where did you learn to write Chinese?

417
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:36,221
When I was a kid, my dad was a
missionary. I was raised in the Orient.

418
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,806
As a young white boy over there...

419
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,652
I needed to learn how to fight,
as you can imagine.

420
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,145
I remember...

421
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,489
my first martial arts teacher
said to me:

422
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,243
"So why do you Come to me?"

423
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,163
I say,
"To learn how to fight."

424
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,245
And he says,
"So you want to hurt people.

425
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,994
But do you want to be great?"
L say, "Yeah.

426
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,918
I want to be great."

427
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:08,633
He says, "Then first learn how
to heal people to be great.

428
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,510
To hurt people is easy."

429
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,367
Look at you.
You look great.

430
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,697
Like it?

431
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,221
That's enough.
Why don't you go sit down?

432
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,816
That bad?

433
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,232
If you need me,
I'll be in the outer room.

434
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,230
O'Malley's the key.
We must find him.

435
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:56,739
You can't compare blood pressure
now with when you're in a coma.

436
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,320
What's this?
555 over four digits.

437
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,573
That's crazy.
Let me see that.

438
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,831
Martha's chicken scratches.
She probably can't even read them.

439
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,746
- You know what it is?
- What?

440
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,827
It's a phone number.

441
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,887
Hello.

442
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,901
When you phoned I asked
everyone here at the home...

443
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:45,698
and there is no O'Malley here.
But it is possible...

444
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,326
O'Malley is a relation
of someone here.

445
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:54,831
Why not leave me your number and
I'll call you if there's any contact.

446
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,879
Can I phone you?

447
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,711
Of course, my dear.

448
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,099
- Here, let me do that.
- That's all right.

449
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,472
It's okay.

450
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,265
Thank you.

451
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,994
You old devil.

452
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,987
Mason Storm.

453
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,932
Hi. I'm sorry.

454
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,474
I don't mean to interrupt.

455
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,224
I was just passing by and I thought...

456
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,943
you might like a flower.

457
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,337
I like that.

458
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,568
Now I lay me down to sleep...

459
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,565
Now we say it together, okay?

460
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,613
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

461
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,407
If I die before I wake...

462
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,491
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

463
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,456
This is Allartha Coe. I
can't come to the phone...

464
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,007
Pick up, Martha.
Please pick up.

465
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,510
Are you there?
I'm coming over.

466
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,164
Are you there? I'm coming over.

467
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,707
You called it right, Axel.

468
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,377
Our girlfriend just showed up.

469
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,481
Martha, open up.
It's me.

470
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,938
What's up?

471
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,193
Hi.

472
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,518
Looking for Martha?

473
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,488
You know where she is?

474
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,323
You haven't seen the news?

475
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,209
She's dead.

476
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,212
She was strangled over in Westwood.

477
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,711
Know something?

478
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,302
You look like the bitch
whose picture's on TV.

479
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,845
The one whose house they found her at.

480
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,594
Hey, get over here.

481
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,437
Okay, boys, mount up.

482
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,876
Ernie, you forgot my buttermilk.

483
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,373
Shit.

484
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,858
Storm.

485
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,870
O'Malley.

486
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,715
That's Sonny, all right.

487
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,310
The kid's a track star.

488
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,888
He does the hundred in 11 flat.

489
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:52,563
He's going to be real fast,
like his old man was.

490
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,318
What do you mean "was"?

491
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,025
I'm not over the hill.

492
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,406
At least, I hope not.

493
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,860
How'd you pull this off?

494
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,371
He made it to my house
the night you were shot.

495
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,792
I got him hidden, played it out
like he was dead...

496
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,420
staged his funeral
with yours and Felicia's.

497
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,789
Everybody bought it.

498
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,337
Where is he?
Is he safe?

499
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,762
Ventura Trinity Prep School,
under my mother's maiden name, Wade.

500
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,102
No one has any idea that he's your son.

501
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,472
So that was your mother that Andy found.

502
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:36,478
Your nurse friend? Yeah.
She left a number and I traced you here.

503
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,780
I don't know how to thank you.

504
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,078
I have no words.

505
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,999
Just seeing your ugly ass alive
is enough for me.

506
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,265
That night in the hospital...

507
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,177
I found the audio tape in your vest.

508
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,685
I must've played that tape 1000 times...

509
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:18,611
looking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

510
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:19,941
Nada.

511
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,780
Where is the tape?

512
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,195
- I turned it in for evidence.
- What?

513
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,867
Don't worry, I made a dupe.

514
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,117
Meanwhile, I thought you'd
take some pleasure in this.

515
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,367
And there's more in the car.

516
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,707
You were not wrong, my friend.

517
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,836
You were not wrong.

518
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,676
What's happened to you?

519
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,232
I was on the case
maybe a year and a half...

520
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,943
trying to find out
who pulled the trigger.

521
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,322
But it was like swimming through shit.

522
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,252
Everywhere I turned,
people told me to back off, get lost.

523
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,079
Then one morning the phone rings.

524
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,373
Immaculate Heart Emergency.

525
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,052
Someone ran my mother off the road.

526
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,176
Her back's broken.
She's paralyzed.

527
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,717
I'm sorry, O'Mal.

528
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:38,933
That night, there's a note in
my locker telling me it's no accident.

529
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,773
What the hell could I do?

530
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,110
I've got my hands tied behind
my back. I can't wave or salute.

531
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,618
So I put my papers in.

532
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:52,989
Took a three-quarter pension.

533
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,538
You know me,
I never would have backed off.

534
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,955
But there was Sonny to worry about.
What if they found him?

535
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,375
- Or you?
- No, you did the right thing.

536
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,460
Then wasn't the time.

537
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,087
Now's the time.

538
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,428
We're outgunned and undermanned,
but We're going to win.

539
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,389
And I'll tell you why.

540
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:18,393
Superior attitude,
superior state of mind.

541
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,894
We'll get them, buddy.

542
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,737
Believe me.

543
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,323
Every fucking one of them.

544
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:59,347
One more favor:
Get Sonny out of that school now.

545
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:04,276
With me up and running, they'll
do anything to find Sonny to get to me.

546
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,862
Get him someplace safe, anywhere.

547
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,780
Consider it done.

548
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,117
I'm going straight to get that film.

549
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,786
As soon as you get that audio,
and Sonny's safe...

550
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,205
we'll bring it in to Jerry Dunphy.

551
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,207
We'll see quite a show on the news.

552
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,835
You got it, partner.

553
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,717
I must've played that tape
1000 times...

554
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:38,094
looking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

555
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,389
Two guys I couldn’t make out,
but they'll come up on the film.

556
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,350
- You can take that to the bank.
- I know that voice.

557
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:50,360
Your charts go back seven years. Do you
have any recollection of anything?

558
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,911
I have them on the same film in
the same camera, right where I left it.

559
01:00:56,236 --> 01:01:00,833
Senator Vernon Trent
promises no new taxes.

560
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,872
And you can take that to the bank.

561
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,332
Money now, and lots more
when I'm in office.

562
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,584
And you can take that to the bank.

563
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:16,006
I'm going to take you to the bank,
Senator Trent.

564
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,266
To the blood bank.

565
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,428
Martha's dead.

566
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:00,680
I'm sorry.

567
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,563
It's all right.

568
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,487
O'Malley was here today.

569
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,821
He was?
How did he get here?

570
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,826
You found him.
The old lady was his mother.

571
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:31,082
My son's alive.

572
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:40,261
We better get out of here.
Really. Let's go.

573
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:45,266
This ain't going to be
my best packing job.

574
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,370
Where are we going?

575
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,039
Out of here.

576
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,117
I'll be glad when all this is over.

577
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,789
Where's my bathrobe?

578
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,665
- I hope it fits in the suitcase.
- Get my jeans and a jacket.

579
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,386
- Hurry up.
- I'm just about done.

580
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,635
Mason.

581
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,391
Get down.

582
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,035
It's jammed.

583
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,419
Look behind you.

584
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,199
Let's go.

585
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,129
Get down.

586
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,138
Come quick.
Let's go.

587
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,580
I'll slit your throat.

588
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,299
You're going to bleed like a pig.

589
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,176
They're out back.

590
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,094
We're on them.

591
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,039
Hang on.

592
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,382
Hulland.
You son of a bitch.

593
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,916
I forgot to lock the door.

594
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,979
Oh, man. The battery's all corroded.

595
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,977
Hey, man, be cool. What's this?

596
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,442
You like my coche?

597
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,199
How hot is it, homes?

598
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,868
Smoking.

599
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,455
You got it.

600
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,416
There's bullet holes in the glass.

601
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,502
This Jeep looks like it's
been in a war, man.

602
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,310
Maybe you should wear
these kind of clothes all the time.

603
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:46,522
Only next time,
we'll use your credit card.

604
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,577
Daddy, I don't want you to go.

605
01:07:56,322 --> 01:08:00,168
You look really great for someone
who changed in a gas station.

606
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,502
Thanks.

607
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:06,796
We're from Hillstar Real Estate.
We can market your home effectively.

608
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:10,049
We aren't even thinking about selling.

609
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,013
In fact, we're adding a nursery.

610
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,806
It's a mess.

611
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,760
- I'd love to see the nursery.
- Over here.

612
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,183
We don't know if it's a girl or a boy...

613
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,347
so we did a splatter effect.

614
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,614
- What are you doing?
- Raiding the icebox.

615
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,002
The plasterer might have fallen.

616
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,711
What about your baby?

617
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,726
Just the way I left you.

618
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:04,982
Good grief.

619
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,731
I'm sorry, but I think your
contractor's doing a lousy job.

620
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,733
These things happen.

621
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,411
Thank God.

622
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,171
Hang on, Mrs. O'Malley.

623
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,091
O'Malley left there
three hours ago with the tape.

624
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,256
It doesn't matter about the tape.

625
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:39,392
We have to get this film
to Dunphy's studio...

626
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,853
before I have a nervous breakdown.

627
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,930
Mrs. O'Malley, listen.

628
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:47,226
I'm across from the Bonaventure Hotel.

629
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,686
I need you to do me a favor.

630
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:54,362
Have O'Malley deliver a message
to the desk under Andrea Smith.

631
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,285
No, we're not checking in.
That's too dangerous.

632
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:01,532
But the desk will hold the message
if you tell them we're coming in later.

633
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,457
All right? Thanks.

634
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,624
Andrea...

635
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,297
Smith.

636
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,300
Bonaventure Hotel...

637
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,712
and leave a message...

638
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,009
at the desk.

639
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:18,798
Baby, that's beautiful.

640
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,971
I love it.

641
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,994
Where's my glove, Uncle Mal?

642
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,498
Take it easy.
Sonny, hurry up, dear.

643
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,129
Sonny, forget the mitt.
We got to get going.

644
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,838
The number for the
Bonaventure Hotel, please.

645
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,675
When this is over...

646
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,925
you, me and your pop
will rent a boat...

647
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:06,513
and catch the biggest fish.
I'm not talking goldfish either.

648
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,725
The last time I went fishing with Pop...

649
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,851
we caught an old tire.

650
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:16,197
Not this time, Sonny.
We'll get us a big, fat tuna.

651
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:17,861
It's them.

652
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,529
Let's go.

653
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,049
Captain Hulland, I.A.P.D.

654
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:47,896
I need to check any messages
for an Andrea Smith.

655
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,085
Here you are, sir.

656
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,090
Good evening, sir.

657
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:36,277
Do you have any messages
for an Andrea Smith, please?

658
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,127
Don't worry, Sonny's okay.

659
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:04,472
He's with O'Malley, who has the tape.
They're headed for Union Station.

660
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:08,344
Great. Let's go get the car.
Just a minute.

661
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,767
- What's wrong?
- Shit.

662
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,060
Fuck.

663
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,161
Cover me.

664
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,927
Don't move.
You're surrounded.

665
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,092
Send for backup.

666
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,266
Hey. You can't do that in Dallas.

667
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,772
That's a rented car.

668
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,989
Get the goddamn car.

669
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,695
Get the car.

670
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:44,822
Once again,
train number 11, the Coast Starlight...

671
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:49,327
from Seattle, Oakland, Santa Barbara,
has been delayed.

672
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,362
Your train's the Southwest Chief.

673
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:54,209
- It departs for Albuquerque at 11:10.
- It's scheduled to arrive...

674
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:58,666
- in Los Angeles at approximately 9:30pm.
- Have a safe trip.

675
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:03,875
Passengers holding sleeping-car
accommodations on train number 4...

676
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:07,921
the Southwest Chief,
please assemble...

677
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,010
My hands are shaking.

678
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,008
Don't worry, kid.

679
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:16,604
Even your old Uncle Mally's paws
wobble a bit from time to time.

680
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,060
Put this on.

681
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:21,438
Watch out for the hot dog.
Don't spill mustard.

682
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,232
Sonny...

683
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:33,078
I know it's hard to put together
after all these years.

684
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:38,209
I'm sorry I told you your dad
was dead. I thought it was best.

685
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,995
I know it's awkward.

686
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,294
But your father loves you very much.

687
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,385
You've got to get to know each
other again. It'll take time.

688
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,384
Now listen up.

689
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:54,763
If your dad gets here on schedule,
you both get on the train.

690
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,603
If he doesn't, you'll be going alone.

691
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,023
One of us will be one step behind.
Don't worry.

692
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,987
One step behind.

693
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,733
Just like we planned in the car
on the way here.

694
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,996
O'Malley, long time no see.

695
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,329
Make sure your father gets this.

696
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,673
Are you taking a trip?

697
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:31,629
Yeah, me and my kid are visiting
my mother in New Mexico.

698
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,344
That's your son?

699
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,177
Funny, he doesn't look much like you.

700
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,642
Does he, Quentero?

701
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:42,849
As a matter of fact...

702
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:46,068
I think I've seen
his ugly face before.

703
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,654
Kind of looks like Mason Storm.

704
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:57,285
Enough of this fucking around.
We want the tape.

705
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:58,577
Run, Sonny.

706
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:08,382
Run, Sonny.

707
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,222
Mally.

708
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,985
Take him.
We're going after the kid.

709
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,535
I love you, Sonny.

710
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,418
You fucks don't deserve your badges.

711
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,091
Come here,
you little son of a bitch.

712
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,302
- The kid's got the tape.
- Get his ass.

713
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,610
Sonny.

714
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:12,564
He's going in the alley.

715
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,741
I'll call the police.

716
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,413
Get out of the way.

717
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,577
Help. Help.

718
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,083
This guy's crazy.
He broke my gate.

719
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,586
Stop.

720
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,046
Please stop.

721
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,892
My hand's bleeding bad.
Go ahead.

722
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,129
Stop.
You little bastard.

723
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,309
Come on, don't mess with me.

724
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,020
You fuck. My leg.

725
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,025
Come here or I'll kill you.

726
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:44,204
I broke my fucking leg.

727
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,561
Coma Cop, let's see what you got.

728
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,809
Dad.

729
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,203
You're still a loser.

730
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,415
I remember you.

731
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:32,146
Dad.

732
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:57,834
Storm.

733
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,751
- Take care of him.
- Where are you going?

734
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,924
One more take-out order.
You're safe with her.

735
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,387
You're okay with me.

736
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,356
Who are you?

737
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:23,272
It's a very long story.

738
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,195
You got a few minutes?

739
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,072
Senator.

740
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,655
I know it's a bad time,
but things have happened...

741
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:15,833
I want Quentero and the others here now.

742
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:18,418
Storm is just nuts enough
to Come after me.

743
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:20,579
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

744
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:24,042
Can we have a little privacy, please?

745
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,177
I'll be downstairs.

746
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:33,601
We're not going to make the
ballet tonight. Take a hike.

747
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,101
Get lost.

748
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:20,772
I'll show you guys how to break.

749
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:37,660
How's the action, boys?

750
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,123
Mind if I play?

751
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:46,666
I know you're thinking, if l have
this in my hand, I can't play.

752
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,584
How's this?

753
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,586
I'll put it away.

754
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:00,057
Well? Somebody hand me a cue.

755
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,460
Impressive.

756
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,840
That's for my wife.
Fuck you and die.

757
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,243
Son of a bitch.

758
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:57,383
How does it feel to know
you're about to die?

759
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:06,769
I'll give you more time
than you gave my wife and son.

760
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,286
I got to tell you.

761
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:30,962
You can't do this.
It wasn't me.

762
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:43,634
Now you're a good cop.

763
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:55,816
Vernon?

764
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,864
Let's try in here.

765
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,215
Maybe you're behind this painting.

766
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,390
No. You're so good at this, Vernon.

767
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,514
Maybe you're under the bed.

768
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,313
No, not under the bed.

769
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,571
What about in here?

770
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,827
Vernon, where are you?

771
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:10,725
Die.

772
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,787
How do you like this, Vernon?

773
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:30,532
I'd like to kill you so bad,
L can barely contain myself.

774
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,204
But I've been thinking.

775
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,545
Death is far too merciful
a fate for you.

776
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,755
So what I'm going to do is...

777
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,047
put you in prison.

778
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:45,256
A nice petite white boy like you
in a federal penitentiary...

779
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:50,599
Let me put it this way: You won't be
able to stay anal-retentive very long.

780
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,772
I'm going to take
these handcuffs here...

781
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:58,648
then I'll arrest you and
I'll take you in. How's that?

782
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,339
Come on. What are you doing?

783
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,458
No, please. No.

784
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,502
No. No.

785
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,434
I missed.

786
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,346
I never miss.

787
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:37,690
They must have been smaller
than I thought.

788
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,607
Freeze.

789
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,523
Drop the gun. Slowly.

790
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,409
Get on your knees
with your hands in the air.

791
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,782
Thank God.
Thank God you guys are here.

792
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,822
Do it now.

793
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:55,954
You got to stop him.

794
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:02,879
Let me go. Storm, no.

795
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,511
Storm.

796
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:09,673
Storm, no.
Hold it right there.

797
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,472
Sergeant, talk to him.
Tell him to let me go.

798
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:20,229
Give me the gun.

799
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,648
Give me the gun.

800
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,402
Give me the gun.

801
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:35,407
We saw the film.

802
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,955
We know you were set up.

803
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,250
Senator, you're under arrest.

804
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:43,878
Cuff him.

805
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,340
What the hell are you talking about?

806
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:51,886
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me.

807
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:56,265
I'm a senator, for Christ's sake.
You can't do this to me.

808
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,526
We're sorry, Storm.

809
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,947
You're a dead man, Storm.

810
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:11,614
Do you hear me.
You won't get away with this.

811
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,783
Dad. Dad!

812
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,539
- Are you all right?
- I love you, Storm.

813
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:20,122
I'm the senator.

814
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,788
How about a nice vacation?

815
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,054
This guy is going to be famous.

816
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:39,013
I can hear tomorrow's weather report.
"Killer Storm strikes back."

817
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:43,312
It shows Trent making
a deal with his underworld cronies.

818
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,570
You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

819
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,739
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

820
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,325
And you can take that to the bank.

821
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:58,577
We have the greatest
respect for Storm's courage.

822
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:02,748
You told me this dock was clean.
What the hell's going on here?

823
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,580
Are you people listening to me?
