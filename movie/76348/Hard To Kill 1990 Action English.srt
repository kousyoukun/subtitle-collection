Who are you?

00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:29,641
I'm Danny, the physical therapist.
I'm going to give you a massage.

Yes, doctor.

[STORM] Get me out. Thanks for the

- Morning. Good.

Can I get your ID, please?

340
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,317
You can't have too much security.

341

If you feel up to it, I'll get you some
lemon chiffon pie out of the freezer.

We are going to put an end...

to violence in this state.
And you can take that to the bank.

Hull and, plaster Storm's ass
with slime in the press.

[HULLAND]
We know how to do our job.

Then show me. I'm starring in the

Who's this guy?

00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,538
Our program came to an
unexpectedly violent conclusion.

380

Are you crazy?
I can't come in to work.

I can't even go
to my apartment, Martha.

Then where are you?

I can't tell you. Besides,

I want to help him...

He's a crooked cop involved in...

[DUNPHY OVER TV]
Police speculate that Storm...

who is known to have ties
with criminal elements...

393
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,486
could have involved
his contacts in his escape.

394
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,156
Storm was thought to have been
a murder victim. A casualty...

395
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,368
of his own greed.
A widespread search is now being...

396

This is Mason Storm. I'd like
to speak with Jerry Dunphy.

No, it's not a joke.

00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,513
We can't stay here.
They'll trace us from the hospital.

00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:37,392
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm house sitting.

400
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,520
It belongs to a friend of my parents.

401
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,523
He's in China on research for six months.

402
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,152
The medical center
only has my apartment address.

403
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,447
Not even my friends have this number.

404

You've got to believe me.

You're safe here, okay?

fugitive officer Mason Storm...

408
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,840
who, until days ago,
had been in a seven-year coma.

409
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:13,887
Storm said he's innocent of charges
made against him in the press...

410
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,723
and that he has
indisputable proof of this.

He has promised me a first look
at his alleged proof.

No, I can do it myself.

You do it then.

You give me this beard?

You tried.

- You ever been to Chinatown?
- Yeah. Why?

419
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:27,043
This is a list of herbs and needles
that I need for my recovery.

420
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,629
Where did you learn to write Chinese?

421
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:36,219
When I was a kid, my dad was a
missionary. I was raised in the Orient.

422
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,805
As a young white boy over there...

423
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,642
I needed to learn how to fight,
as you can imagine.

424
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,143
I remember...

425
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,480
my first martial arts teacher
said to me:

426
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,233
So why do you come to me?

427
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,152
I say, To learn how to fight.

428
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,239
And he says,
So you want to hurt people.

429
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,993
But do you want to be great?
I say, Yeah.

430
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,912
I want to be great.

431
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:08,626
He says, Then first learn how
to heal people to be great.

432
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,504
To hurt people is easy.

Look at you.
You look great.

434
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,696

435
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,211
That's enough.
Why don't you go sit down?

I'll be in the outer room.

everyone here at the home...

and there is no O'Malley here.
But it is possible...

That's Sonny, all right.

The kid's a track star.

He does the hundred in 11 flat.

He's going to be real fast,
like his old man was.

How'd you pull this off?

He made it to my house
the night you were shot.

I got him hidden, played it out

No one has any idea that he's your son.

So that was your mother that Andy found.

Your nurse friend? Yeah.
She left a number and I traced you here.

I have no words.

Just seeing your ugly ass alive

That night in the hospital...

I found the audio tape in your vest.

Don't worry, I made a dupe.

[O'MALLEY] I was on the case

But it was like swimming through shit.

Everywhere I turned,
people told me to back off, get lost.

Then one morning the phone rings.

Someone ran my mother off the road.

I'm sorry, O'Mal.

my locker telling me it's no accident.

What the hell could I do?

I've got my hands tied behind
my back. I can't wave or salute.

So I put my papers in.

No, we're not checking in.
That's too dangerous.

But the desk will hold the message
if you tell them we're coming in later.

01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:50,592
Let me put it this way: You won't be
able to stay anal-retentive very long.

788
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:53,762
I'm going to take
these handcuffs here...

789
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:58,642
then I'll arrest you and
I'll take you in. How's that?

790
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,329
Come on. What are you doing?

791
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,456
No, please. No.

792
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,500
No. No.

793
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,128
[GUNSHOT]

794
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,425
I missed.

795
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,344
I never miss.

796
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:37,681
They must have been smaller
than I thought.

797
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,601
Freeze.

798
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,521
OFFICER:
Drop the gun. Slowly.

799
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:47,399
Get on your knees
with your hands in the air.

800
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,776
[TRENT] Thank God.
Thank God you guys are here.

801
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:51,820
Do it now.

802
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:55,949
[TRENT]
You got to stop him.

803
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:02,873
Let me go. Storm, no.

804
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,501
[SERGEANT]
Storm.

805
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:09,671
[SERGEANT] Storm, no.
Hold it right there.

806
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,467
[TRENT] Sergeant, talk to him.
Tell him to let me go.

807
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:20,223
Give me the gun.

808
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,646
[SERGEANT]
Give me the gun.

809
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,400
Give me the gun.

810
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:35,405
We saw the film.

811
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,949
We know you were set up.

812
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:41,244
[SERGEANT]
Senator, you're under arrest.

813
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:43,872
Cuff him.

814
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,335
[TRENT]
What the hell are you talking about?

815
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:51,880
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me.

816
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:56,259
I'm a senator, for Christ's sake.
You can't do this to me.

817
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,517
We're sorry, Storm.

818
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,938
You're a dead man, Storm.

819
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:11,608
Do you hear me.
You won't get away with this.

820
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,777
Dad. Dad.

821
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,530
[SONNY] Are you all right?
[ANDY] I love you, Storm.

822
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:20,116
[TRENT]
I'm the senator.

823
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,786
[STORM]
How about a nice vacation?

824
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:35,048
OFFICER:
This guy is going to be famous.

825
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:39,010
I can hear tomorrow's weather report.
Killer Storm strikes back.

826
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:43,306
[DUNPHY OVER TV] It shows Trent making
a deal with his underworld cronies.

827
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:46,560
[TRENT OVER TV] You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

828
01:32:47,019 --> 01:32:49,729
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

829
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,315
And you can take that to the bank.

830
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:58,572
DUNPHY [OVER TV]: We have the greatest
respect for Storm's courage.

831
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:02,742
[TRENT] You told me this dock was clean.
What the hell's going on here?

832
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,579
[TRENT]
Are you people listening to me?
