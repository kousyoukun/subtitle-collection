1
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,945
Come on. Let's go, guys. I'm missing the Oscars.

2
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:54,865
CALABRESE:
Hey, Mikey, <i>la luce,</i> the light.

3
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,976
VALERO: <i>Calabrese, nice to see you.</i>
CALABRESE: <i>Nice to see you too.</i>

4
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,396
VALERO:
<i>This is our friend I told you about.</i>

5
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,314
STORM:
Calabrese.

6
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,441
I know you.

7
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,027
Who are these other mystery guests?

8
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:39,118
CALABRESE:
<i>Murder is a very serious business, my friend.</i>

9
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,745
<i>And an expensive one.</i>

10
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:45,166
TRENT:
<i>You'll be very well compensated, Mr. Calabrese</i>

11
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,210
<i>Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.</i>

12
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,296
<i>You can take that to the bank.</i>

13
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,548
CALABRESE:
<i>Slowly. Slowly.</i>

14
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,925
<i>And always with caution.</i>

15
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:59,221
TRENT: <i>Listen. I want you to turn
Senator Caldwell into a memory.</i>

16
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,933
<i>I'm not waiting for him
to die of natural causes.</i>

17
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,936
CALABRESE:
<i>All I'm counseling is patience.</i>

18
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,773
<i>The man is public.
He's in the papers every day.</i>

19
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,943
TRENT: Next time I read about him,
it better be the obituaries.

20
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,945
Who are you?

21
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,281
Get out of the shadows.

22
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,866
VALERO:
<i>Enough bullshit</i>

23
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,370
VALERO: <i>Can you do this job or not?</i>
CALABRESE: <i>It'll be taken care of.</i>

24
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,958
TRENT: Gentlemen, enough bickering.
This is business.

25
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,171
TRENT:
<i>I think we understand each other.</i>

26
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,049
CALABRESE:
<i>Then let's just stick to business.</i>

27
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,720
TRENT:
<i>It's a light plane.</i>

28
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,139
TRENT:
A Lear P-61.

29
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,644
We want it to take off.
We don't want it to land.

30
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,479
(NOISE)

31
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,481
TRENT:
What the--

32
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,155
You told me this dock was clean.

33
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,294
Mikey. Quit playing
with yourself back there.

34
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,846
CALABRESE: Get that bastard.
TRENT: Let's get out of here.

35
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,375
I don't want him to get an hour older.

36
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,752
He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.

37
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,757
No kidding.

38
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,468
ANNOUNCER 1 [OVER TV]
<i>And the winner is:</i>

39
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,555
ANNOUNCER 2 [OVER TV]:
<i>Ben Kingsley for Gandhi.</i>

40
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,808
Amigo, are you deaf?

41
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,519
QUENTERO:
Storm on 3.

42
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:11,770
Thanks, Max.

43
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:13,897
QUENTERO:
Axel, line 3.

44
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,650
Throwing away dimes now?

45
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,862
This doesn't go out.
For your ears only.

46
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,243
What?

47
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,787
Calabrese.
I got his ass on film.

48
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,581
You're full of shit.

49
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:35,377
Him and his pet cockroach, Valero.
On film and audio, laying out a hit.

50
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:39,298
STORM [OVER <i>PHONE]: Two guys I couldn't
make. I think they'll come up on film.</i>

51
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,844
I think this is the big one.
Our own little Academy Award.

52
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,846
It's good. Ready?

53
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,349
- Shoot.
<i>- Listen, Carlito.</i>

54
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,518
<i>Nobody but us knows about this.</i>

55
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,316
LADY: Thanks.
STORM: You're welcome.

56
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,448
- How you doing tonight?
- What can I do for you?

57
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,700
Got any champagne?

58
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,120
Right next to the caviar.

59
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,623
- That was funny.
- Great.

60
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,334
In the big cooler back there.

61
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,545
How come you're not watching
the Oscars tonight?

62
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,714
The Oscars?

63
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,007
Yeah, the Oscars.

64
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,592
I hate the Oscars.

65
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,427
You're not having a good time?

66
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,222
Who needs the goddamn movies?

67
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,142
COUNTERMAN:
I got a show in here every night.

68
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,061
You got horror, sex...

69
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,605
...freaks, violence.

70
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,983
And I don't got to pay no 4 bucks.

71
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,654
You should film it.
Get your own show.

72
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,864
I'll be great in a porno.

73
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,995
Better dial 911.

74
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,165
PUNK 1:
<i>You don't want to call 911.</i>

75
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,126
Holy shit.

76
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,130
You remember me, viejo?

77
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,507
PUNK 1:
That's right.

78
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,217
You remember.

79
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,053
He grew some hair
since we last seen him.

80
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,263
PUNK 1:
Not a lot.

81
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,223
Where's the rug?

82
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,686
You know what I want.
Go ahead.

83
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,229
Move.

84
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,524
That's my money.

85
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,279
Take my life savings.

86
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,866
Where's a cop when you need one?

87
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,453
They're out eating doughnuts.

88
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,709
I got half a mind to bash your--

89
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,176
Now you only got half a mind.

90
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,636
PUNK 2:
Take him out, man.

91
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,347
Let's go, hero.

92
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,601
PUNK 1: That's it, right here.
What are you grinning at?

93
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,394
You know...

94
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,439
...there's only four of you guys...

95
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,567
...and you only have one shot left.

96
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,873
Go low, man.

97
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,751
Get the maricén, man.

98
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,589
PUNK 2:
What are you doing on the ground?.

99
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,932
I'll out your heart out.

100
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,726
Yeah? Come and cut my heart out.

101
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,021
Come and cut my heart out.

102
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,814
Come on, punk.

103
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,985
I know what you're thinking.
Mine's bigger than yours.

104
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,779
It's not fair.

105
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,614
I'll throw it away.

106
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,953
What if I show you
what it's like to be a victim?

107
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,624
STORM: Come on.
PUNK 2: You're fucking dead, man.

108
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,670
It's still not fair.
Okay, I'll get down on my knees.

109
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,338
Better?

110
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,550
Come get some.

111
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,560
DETECTIVE:
Looks like you won the Oscar, Storm.

112
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,277
(MUSIC OVER RADIO)

113
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,957
TRENT [OVER RADIO]: <i>You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.</i>

114
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,209
<i>Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.</i>

115
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,503
<i>You can take that to the bank.</i>

116
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,006
I know that voice.

117
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,136
Is that you, honey?

118
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,347
STORM:
Yeah, baby.

119
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,349
In the flesh.

120
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,240
What are you doing?
Come on.

121
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,326
STORM:
I'm raiding the icebox.

122
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,037
I gave up my diet for Lent.

123
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,668
Champagne?

124
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,254
STORM:
Does that put you in the mood?

125
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,591
Think this could do it?

126
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,144
FELICIA: I had to bribe him to go
to bed with six cookies...

127
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,188
...and a glass of orange juice.

128
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,487
I wish I could sleep like that.

129
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,823
Maybe I can help you.

130
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,450
SONNY:
Is that for me, Dad?

131
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,286
You faker.

132
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,126
Here you go.

133
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,128
There you go.

134
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:56,299
- Did you say your prayers?
- I wanted to do them with you.

135
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,596
There's a trick to getting
what you want when you say prayers.

136
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,682
What, Daddy?

137
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,936
You ask for things for other people,
like your mom and Uncle O'Malley.

138
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,398
Then how do I get stuff for myself?

139
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,401
That's why God invented work.

140
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,696
Want to say a little prayer with me?
Come here.

141
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,867
Want to say your prayers?

142
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,203
Now I lay me down to sleep.

143
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:30,000
And we say together:
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

144
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,919
If I die before I wake...

145
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,131
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

146
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,258
Amen. Very good.

147
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,350
Good night, Dad.

148
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,895
- Good night.
- Good night, Mommy.

149
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,855
STORM:
Sleep well, champ.

150
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,861
Here's to us.

151
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,542
I had a shitty day today.

152
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,800
There's blood on your shirt.

153
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,718
It's not my blood.

154
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,429
So you don't have to worry.

155
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,107
If people knew how sweet you are...

156
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,236
...they'd never be scared of you.

157
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,910
I'm not scared of you.

158
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,120
Maybe you should be.

159
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,262
<i>We'll try to squeeze it in.</i>

160
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,265

I've known him since...

O'MALLEY:
Jesus Christ.

189

TRENT:
...I was City Attorney...

190
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,816
...and he was a young...

191

...homicide detective.

192
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,654
We worked together...

193
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,826
We worked on several cases.

of an officer he knew.

197

Terrible circumstances here

...and a calamity-filled mob scene
of policemen...

199

TRENT:
What makes people do this?

200
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:21,643
Would somebody please tell me that.

201
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,105
Hulland.

DOCTOR: Coming through, please.
NURSE: Stand back, please.

DOCTOR:
Blood pressure's 70/40.

207

They always said Storm was superhuman.

208
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,380
HULLAND: Know why?
He was jacked up on coke.

209
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,469
I'll tell you something.
He was the cleanest man I knew.

210
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,305
He had more honor than
this whole department.

211
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,517
If I ever hear you
talk that puke again...

...I'll put you where you belong.

213
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,313
What the fuck is I.A. doing here?

214
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,482
- Taking over the show.
- Bullshit.

215
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,068
This is Homicide, not Internal Affairs.

216
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,821
We got two cops down with
money and drugs all over.

217
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,323
This came from the commissioner.

218

Captain Hulland?

219
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,119
What?

220
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,621
Storm is dead.

221
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,136
HULLAND:
O'Malley...

222
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,185
...I know you and Storm were tight.

223
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,355
For what it's worth...

224
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,442
...I'm sorry.

225
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,447
The most unstoppable
son of a bitch I ever knew.

226
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,451
He got stopped tonight.

227
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,796
Excuse me.
Are you with the police?

228
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,049
Lieutenant O'Malley.
What do you got?

229
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,177
A live cop is what I've got.

230
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,807
FEMALE REPORTER: What's happening?
O'MALLEY: No comment. It's over.

231
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,438
DOCTOR:
We've got a pulse.

232
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,191
Your man's alive, lieutenant.

233
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,818
Who else knows he isn't dead?

234
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,737
Just the people in here.

235
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,989
I want to see each of them.

236
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:43,910
And no one else comes in here
as of now. You got that?

237
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,335
DOCTOR:
Lieutenant, this is still a hospital.

238
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,671
I appreciate your problem.

239
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,007
But I'm acting under orders
of the police commissioner.

240
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,177
- I hope you can document that.
- I can and will.

241
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:07,267
Mason Storm's going to vanish,
and you'll help make that happen.

242
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:12,605
Till he can give us some answers,
the deader he is, the safer he is.

243
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,705
O'MALLEY: Don't worry, buddy.

00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,205
You're my cutest patient,
but not my only one.

318
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,958
- You're making a mistake.
- I'll be back.

319
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,335
No. Don't go.

320
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,678
How's it going, brother?

321
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,680
Who are you?

322
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:29,643
I'm Danny, the physical therapist.
I'm going to give you a massage.

323
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,605
DANNY: I'll make you feel all right.
STORM: Get the fuck out.

324
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,982
I'll just take you down the hall.

325
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,194
NURSE: Thank you.
- Anytime.

326
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:43,783
WOMAN: <i>Dr. Mathews,
call Coma Research, please.</i>

327
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,286
AXEL: Can I see your list of patients
in your coma care unit?

328
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,662
Yes, doctor.

329
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:57,838
STORM: Get me out. Thanks for the
massage, but get me out of here.

330
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:01,509
Just relax. You'll get out
of here real soon, I promise.

331
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:05,763
- Morning, Sheri. How you doing?
- Morning. Good.

332
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,559
Thank you.

333
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,645
Thank you.

334
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,362
- You know that doctor?
- No.

335
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,918
AXEL:
John Doe.

336
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:12,514
SECURITY:
Excuse me.

337
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,016
Doctor?

338
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:19,271
I have to check everyone
on these ﬂoors.

339
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,107
Can I get your ID, please?

340
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,319
You can't have too much security.

341
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:36,538
If you feel up to it, I'll get you some
lemon chiffon pie out of the freezer.

342
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,207
STORM:
Get me out of here.

343
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,626
DANNY: Don't worry.
I'll take good care of you.

344
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,420
If you want, I'll hook you up
with some pizza.

345
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,839
You got to learn to relax.

346
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,467
Orderly.
Give me a little help.

347
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,971
Give me some help down here.

348
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,852
DANNY:
What's he doing down there?.

349
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,896
DAN NY:
What's wrong?

350
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,815
Russ.

351
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,525
What happened?

352
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,485
He's dead.

353
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,204
ANDY:
My poor back.

354

AXEL:
You son of a bitch.

355
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,967
AXEL:
Storm, you son of a bitch.

356
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,240
Oh, my God.

357
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,242
Russ. Danny.

358
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,615
AXEL:
I'll get you, Storm.

359
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:41,723
J.D.

360
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,475
ANDY:
Oh, my God.

361
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,646
Now will you listen to me?

362
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,154
ANDY:
Hold tight.

363
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,407
Sorry.

364
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:00,576
AXEL:
Stop.

365
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,161
ANDY:
Hang on.

366
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,086
AXEL:
Watch out.

367
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,405
Get out of the way.

368
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,694
TRENT: Ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to put a stop to it...

369
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,822
...and we're going to start right here.

370
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,120
We are going to put an end...

371
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:32,334
...to violence in this state.
And you can take that to the bank.

372
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,716
Hulland, plaster Storm's ass
with slime in the press.

373
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:44,012
Make him responsible for that
hospital mess. Tail people he knows.

374
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,847
HULLAND:
We know how to do our job

375
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:49,851
Then show me. I'm starring in the
son of a bitch's home movies.

376
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:53,480
If that crap gets out,
I'm looking at 30 years.

377
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,075
Geraldo.

378
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,411
Who's this guy?

379
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:53,540
<i>Our program came to an
unexpectedly violent conclusion.</i>

380
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,935
Are you crazy?
I can't come in to work.

381
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,105
I can't even go
to my apartment, Martha.

382
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,107
People are dead.

383
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,942
MARTHA [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Then where are you?</i>

384
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,071
I can't tell you. Besides,
you're better off not knowing.

385
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,791
ANNOUNCER [OVER TV]: <i>Senator Vernon
Trent promises no new taxes.</i>

386

<i>And you can take that to the bank.</i>

387
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,759
What'll I do with this guy?
I want to help him...

388
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,888
...but he's all over TV.
He's a crooked cop involved in--

389
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,394
Why are you out of bed?

390
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:56,853
I've got you.

DUNPHY [OVER TV]:
<i>Police speculate that Storm...</i>

392
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:03,360
<i>...who is known to have ties
with criminal elements...</i>

393
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:06,488
<i>...could have involved
his contacts in his escape</i>

394
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:10,158
<i>Storm was thought to have been
a murder victim. A casualty...</i>

395
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,370
<i>...of his own greed.
A widespread search is now being--</i>

396
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,087
This is Mason Storm. I'd like
to speak with Jerry Dunphy.

397
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,175
No, it's not a joke.

398
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,515
We can't stay here.
They'll trace us from the hospital.

399
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,394
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm housesitting.

400
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,522
It belongs to a friend of my parents.

401
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,525
He's in China on research for six months.

402
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,154
The medical center
only has my apartment address.

403
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:50,449
Not even my friends have this number.

404
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,827
You've got to believe me.

405
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,329
You're safe here, okay?

406
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:03,545
DUNPHY [OVER TV]: <i>This reporter was
contacted personally by the "Coma Cop</i>

407
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,505
<i>...fugitive officer Mason Storm...</i>

408

had been in a seven-year coma.</i>

409
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:13,889
<i>Storm said he's innocent of charges
made against him in the press...</i>

410
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,725
<i>...and that he has
indisputable proof of this.</i>

<i>He has promised me a first look
at his alleged proof.</i>

412
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,734
I want 24-hour surveillance
on that son of a bitch...

413
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:28,445
...and those two nurses from the hospital.

414
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,208
No, I can do it myself.

415
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,251
You do it then.

416
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,096
You give me this beard?

417
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,108
You tried.

418
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,789
- You ever been to Chinatown?
- Yeah. Why?

419
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:27,045
This is a list of herbs and needles
that I need for my recovery.

420
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,631
Where did you learn to write Chinese?

421
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:36,221
When I was a kid, my dad was a
missionary. I was raised in the Orient.

422
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,807
As a young white boy over there...

423
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,644
...I needed to learn how to fight,
as you can imagine.

424
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,145
I remember...

425
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,482
...my first martial arts teacher
said to me:

426
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,235
"So why do you come to me?"

427
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,154
I say,
"To learn how to fight."

428
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,241
And he says,
"So you want to hurt people.

429
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,995
But do you want to be great?"
I say, "Yeah.

430
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,914
I want to be great."

431
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:08,628
He says, "Then first learn how
to heal people to be great.

432
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,506
To hurt people is easy."

433
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:35,363
Look at you.
You look great.

434
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,698
Like it?

435
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:52,213
That's enough.
Why don't you go sit down?

436
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,808
That bad?

437
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,231
If you need me,
I'll be in the outer room.

438
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,227
STORM: O'Malley's the key.
We must find him.

439
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:56,731
ANDY: You can't compare blood pressure
now with when you're in a coma.

440
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:59,317
What's this?
555 over four digits.

441
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:01,569
ANDY: That's crazy.
Let me see that.

442
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,824
Martha's chicken scratches.
She probably can't even read them.

443
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,742
- You know what it is?
- What?

444
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,828
It's a phone number.

445
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,887
Hello.

446
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:40,900
When you phoned I asked
everyone here at the home...

447
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:45,697
...and there is no O'Malley here.
But it is possible...

448
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,325
...O'Malley is a relation
of someone here.

449
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:54,831
Why not leave me your number and
I'll call you if there's any contact.

450
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,876
Can I phone you?

451
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,712
Of course, my dear.

452
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,091
- Here, let me do that.
- That's all right.

453
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,468
It's okay.

454
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,262
Thank you.

455
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,994
You old devil.

456
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,980
Mason Storm.

457
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,925
Hi. I'm sorry.

458
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,470
I don't mean to interrupt.

459
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,224
I was just passing by and I thought...

460
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,936
...you might like a flower.

461
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,330
ANDY:
I like that.

462
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,561
STORM:
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep</i>

463
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,565
<i>Now we say it together, okay?</i>

464
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,609
STORM & SONNY:
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to keep</i>

465
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,404
<i>If I die before I wake...</i>

466
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,490
<i>...I pray the Lord my soul to take.</i>

467

Pick up, Martha.
Please pick up.

469
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,510

00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,700
HULLAND:
You called it right, Axel.

472
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,369
Our girlfriend just showed up.

473
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,474
Martha, open up.
It's me.

474
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,938
NEIGHBOR:
What's up?

475
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,189
Hi.

476
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,483
NEIGHBOR:
Looking for Martha?

477
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,485
You know where she is?

478
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:02,323
You haven't seen the news?

479
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,201
She's dead.

480
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:09,205
She was strangled over in Westwood.

481
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:11,707
Know something?

482
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,294
You look like the bitch
whose picture's on TV.

483
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,841
The one whose house they found her at.

484
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:23,594
Hey, get over here.

485
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,433
HULLAND:
Okay, boys, mount up.

486
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:51,872
WOMAN:
Ernie, you forgot my buttermilk.

487
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,374
Shit.

488
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,854
O'MALLEY:
Storm.

489
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:23,863
O'Malley.

490
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,716
O'MALLEY:
That's Sonny, all right.

491
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,302
The kid's a track star.

492
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,888
He does the hundred in 11 flat.

493
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:52,558
He's going to be real fast,
like his old man was.

494
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,310
What do you mean "was"?

495
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,021
I'm not over the hill.

496
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,398
At least, I hope not.

497
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,860
How'd you pull this off?

498
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:06,364
He made it to my house
the night you were shot.

499
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:10,785
I got him hidden, played it out
like he was dead...

500
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:13,412
...staged his funeral
with yours and Felicia's.

501
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,790
Everybody bought it.

502
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,337
Where is he?
Is he safe?

503
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,758
Ventura Trinity Prep School,
under my mother's maiden name, Wade.

504
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:29,095
No one has any idea that he's your son.

505
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:31,472
So that was your mother that Andy found.

506
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:36,477
Your nurse friend? Yeah.
She left a number and I traced you here.

507
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:44,777
I don't know how to thank you.

508
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:47,071
I have no words.

509
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:50,991
Just seeing your ugly ass alive
is enough for me.

510
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,257
That night in the hospital...

511
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,177
...I found the audio tape in your vest.

512
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,681
I must've played that tape 1000 times...

513
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:18,602
...looking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

514
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:19,937
<i>Nada.</i>

515
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,772
STORM:
Where is the tape?

516
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,191
- I turned it in for evidence.
- What?

517
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,860
Don't worry, I made a dupe.

518
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,113
Meanwhile, I thought you'd
take some pleasure in this.

519
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,367
O'MALLEY:
And there's more in the car.

520
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,704
You were not wrong, my friend.

521
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,832
You were not wrong.

522
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,676
What's happened to you?

523
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,232
O'MALLEY: I was on the case
maybe a year and a half...

524
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:07,943
...trying to find out
who pulled the trigger.

525
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:11,322
But it was like swimming through shit.

526
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,243
Everywhere I turned,
people told me to back off, get lost.

527
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,079
Then one morning the phone rings.

528
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,373
Immaculate Heart Emergency.

529
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,044
Someone ran my mother off the road.

530
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,172
Her back's broken.
She's paralyzed.

531
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,717
STORM:
I'm sorry, O'Mal.

532
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:38,933
O'MALLEY: That night, there's a note in
my locker telling me it's no accident.

533
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,769
What the hell could I do?

534
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:46,106
I've got my hands tied behind
my back. I can't wave or salute.

535
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,610
So I put my papers in.

536
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:52,988
Took a three-quarter pension.

537
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,534
You know me,
I never would have backed off.

538
00:58:57,076 --> 00:59:00,955
But there was Sonny to worry about.
What if they found him?

539
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,375
- Or you?
- No, you did the right thing.

540
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,460
Then wasn't the time.

541
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,087
Now's the time.

542
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:12,424
We're outgunned and undermanned,
but we're going to win.

543
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,385
And I'll tell you why.

544
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:18,389
Superior attitude,
superior state of mind.

545
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,894
We'll get them, buddy.

546
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,729
Believe me.

547
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,323
Every fucking one of them.

548
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:59,346
One more favor:
Get Sonny out of that school now.

549
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,268
With me up and running, they'll
do anything to find Sonny to get to me.

550
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,854
Get him someplace safe, anywhere.

551
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,772
O'MALLEY:
Consider it done.

552
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:12,109
I'm going straight to get that film.

553
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:14,778
As soon as you get that audio,
and Sonny's safe...

554
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:17,197
...we'll bring it in to Jerry Dunphy.

555
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,199
We'll see quite a show on the news.

556
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,827
You got it, partner.

557
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,714
O'MALLEY: <i>I must've played that tape
1000 times...</i>

558
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:38,093
<i>...looking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.</i>

559
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:42,389
STORM: <i>Two guys I couldn't make out,
but they'll come up on the film.</i>

560
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:45,351
TRENT: <i>You can take that to the bank.</i>
STORM: <i>I know that voice.</i>

561
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:50,356
ANDY: <i>Your charts go back seven years.
Do you have any recollection of anything?</i>

562
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:55,903
STORM: <i>I have them on the same film in
the same camera, right where I left it.</i>

563
01:00:56,236 --> 01:01:00,824
ANNOUNCER: <i>Senator Vernon Trent
promises no new taxes.</i>

564
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:02,868
TRENT:
<i>And you can take that to the bank.</i>

565
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,332
<i>Money now, and lots more
when I'm in office.</i>

566
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,584
<i>And you can take that to the bank.</i>

567
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:16,006
I'm going to take you to the bank,
Senator Trent.

568
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,258
To the blood bank.

569
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,421
Martha's dead.

570
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:00,676
I'm sorry.

571
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,564
It's all right.

572
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,483
O'Malley was here today.

573
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:20,821
He was?
How did he get here?

574
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,825
You found him.
The old lady was his mother.

575
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:31,081
My son's alive.

576
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:40,257
We better get out of here.
Really. Let's go.

577
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:45,262
ANDY: This ain't going to be
my best packing job.

578
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:02,362
Where are we going?

579
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,031
Out of here.

580
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,117
ANDY:
I'll be glad when all this is over.

581
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,786
Where's my bathrobe?

582
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,664
ANDY:I hope it fits in the suitcase.
STORM: Get my jeans and a jacket.

583
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,377
STORM: Hurry up.
ANDY: I'm just about done.

584
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:21,632
Mason.

585
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,391
Get down.

586
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,031
It's jammed.

587
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:59,419
ANDY:
Look behind you.

588
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,192
Let's go.

589
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,125
Get down.

590
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:48,135
Come quick.
Let's go.

591
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,580
AXEL:
I'll slit your throat.

592
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,291
You're going to bleed like a pig.

593
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,168
They're out back.

594
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,086
We're on them.

595
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:00,040
STORM:
Hang on.

596
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,379
Hulland.
You son of a bitch.

597
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,916
ANDY:
I forgot to lock the door.

598
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,971
MAN 1:
Oh, man. The battery's all corroded.

599
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,973
MAN 2:
Hey, man, be cool. What's this?

600
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,601
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

601
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,438
<i>You like my coche?</i>

602
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,191
How hot is it, homes?

603
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,860
Smoking.

604
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:14,448
You got it.

605
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,412
MAN 1:
There's bullet holes in the glass.

606
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,498
MAN 2: This Jeep looks like it's
been in a war, man.

607
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,310
Maybe you should wear
these kind of clothes all the time.

608
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:46,521
Only next time,
we'll use your credit card.

609
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,570
<i>Daddy, I don't want you to go.</i>

610
01:07:56,323 --> 01:08:00,160
ANDY: You look really great for someone
who changed in a gas station.

611
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,495
Thanks.

612
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:06,792
ANDY: We're from Hillstar Real Estate.
We can market your home effectively.

613
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:10,045
We aren't even thinking about selling.

614
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,005
In fact, we're adding a nursery.

615
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:13,799
It's a mess.

616
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,760
- I'd love to see the nursery.
- Over here.

617
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,179
We don't know if it's a girl or a boy...

618
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,348
...so we did a splatter effect.

619
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,611
FELICIA: What are you doing?
STORM: Raiding the icebox.

620
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,001
The plasterer might have fallen.

621
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,711
ANDY:
What about your baby?

622
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,718
STORM:
Just the way I left you.

623
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:04,975
Good grief.

624
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,730
I'm sorry, but I think your
contractor's doing a lousy job.

625
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:13,733
These things happen.

626
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,411
STORM:
Thank God.

627
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:31,168
Hang on, Mrs. O'Malley.

628
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:34,087
O'Malley left there
three hours ago with the tape.

629
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,256
It doesn't matter about the tape.

630
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:39,384
We have to get this film
to Dunphy's studio...

631
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,845
...before I have a nervous breakdown.

632
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:43,930
Mrs. O'Malley, listen.

633
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:47,225
I'm across from the Bonaventure Hotel.

634
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,686
I need you to do me a favor.

635
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:54,357
Have O'Malley deliver a message
to the desk under Andrea Smith.

636
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,277
No, we're not checking in.
That's too dangerous.

637
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:01,531
But the desk will hold the message
if you tell them we're coming in later.

638
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:03,450
All right? Thanks.

639
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,620

642
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,712

643
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,005
<i>...at the desk.</i>

644
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:18,798
Baby, that's beautiful.

645
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,967
I love it.

646
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,990
SONNY:
Where's my glove, Uncle Mal?

647
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,494
Take it easy.
Sonny, hurry up, dear.

648
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:50,121
Sonny, forget the mitt.
We got to get going.

649
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,833
The number for the
Bonaventure Hotel, please.

O'MALLEY:
When this is over...

651
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:01,925
...you, me and your pop
will rent a boat...

652
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:06,513
...and catch the biggest fish.
I'm not talking goldfish either.

653
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,724
SONNY:
The last time I went fishing with Pop...

654
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,851
...we caught an old tire.

655
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:16,189
O'MALLEY: Not this time, Sonny.
We'll get us a big, fat tuna.

656
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:17,857
It's them.

657
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,526
Let's go.

661
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,887
I need to check any messages
for an Andrea Smith.

662
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,077
Here you are, sir.

663
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,082
Good evening, sir.

664
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:36,269
Do you have any messages
for an Andrea Smith, please?

665

Don't worry, Sonny's okay.

666
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:04,464
He's with O'Malley, who has the tape.
They're headed for Union Station.

667
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:08,343
Great. Let's go get the car.
Just a minute.

668
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,763
ANDY: What's wrong?
- Shit.

669
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,057
Fuck.

Hey. You can't do that in Dallas.

Sonny...

690
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:33,071
I know it's hard to put together
after all these years.

691
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:38,201
I'm sorry I told you your dad
was dead. I thought it was best.

692
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,995
I know it's awkward.

693
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:44,290
But your father loves you very much.

694
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:48,378
You've got to get to know each
other again. It'll take time.

Now listen up.

If your dad gets here on schedule,
you both get on the train.

697
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,595
If he doesn't, you'll be going alone.

698
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:01,015
One of us will be one step behind.
Don't worry.

One step behind.

on the way here.

O'Malley, long time no see.

702
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:19,325
Make sure your father gets this.

703
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:26,666
Are you taking a trip?

704
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:31,629
Yeah, me and my kid are visiting
my mother in New Mexico.

705
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:34,340
That's your son?

706
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,177
Funny, he doesn't look much like you.

707
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,638
Does he, Quentero?

708
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:42,849
As a matter of fact...

709
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:46,060
...I think I've seen
his ugly face before.

No. You're so good at this, Vernon.

But I've been thinking.

01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:35,537
Death is far too merciful
a fate for you.

785
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:37,748
So what I'm going to do is...

786
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:41,043
...put you in prison.

787
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:45,255
A nice petite white boy like you
in a federal penitentiary...

788
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:50,594
Let me put it this way: You won't be
able to stay anal-retentive very long.

789
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,764
I'm going to take
these handcuffs here...

790
01:29:54,223 --> 01:29:58,644
...then I'll arrest you and
I'll take you in. How's that?

791
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,331
Come on. What are you doing?

792
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,458
No, please. No.

793
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,502
No. No.

794
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:26,130
(GUNSHOT)

795
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:31,427
I missed.

796
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:34,346
I never miss.

797
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:37,683
They must have been smaller
than I thought.

798
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:41,603
Freeze.

799
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:44,523
OFFICER:
Drop the gun. Slowly.

800
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,401
Get on your knees
with your hands in the air.

801
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,778
TRENT: Thank God.
Thank God you guys are here.

802
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,822
Do it now.

803
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:55,951
TRENT:
You got to stop him.

804
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:02,875
Let me go. Storm, no.

805
01:31:05,169 --> 01:31:06,503
SERGEANT:
Storm.

806
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:09,673
SERGEANT: Storm, no.
Hold it right there.

807
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:13,469
TRENT: Sergeant, talk to him.
Tell him to let me go.

808
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:20,225
Give me the gun.

809
01:31:25,022 --> 01:31:26,648
SERGEANT:
Give me the gun.

810
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,402
Give me the gun.

811
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:35,407
We saw the film.

812
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:37,951
We know you were set up.

813
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,246
SERGEANT:
Senator, you're under arrest.

814
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:43,874
Cuff him.

815
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:48,337
TRENT:
What the hell are you talking about?

816
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:51,882
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me.

817
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:56,261
I'm a senator, for Christ's sake.
You can't do this to me.

818
01:32:02,059 --> 01:32:03,519
We're sorry, Storm.

819
01:32:06,355 --> 01:32:07,940
You're a dead man, Storm.

820
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:11,610
Do you hear me.
You won't get away with this.

821
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,779
Dad. Dad.

822
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:16,532
SONNY: Are you all right?
ANDY: I love you, Storm.

823
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:20,118
TRENT:
I'm the senator.

824
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:22,788
STORM:
How about a nice vacation?

825
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,050
OFFICER:
This guy is going to be famous.

826
01:32:35,384 --> 01:32:39,012
I can hear tomorrow's weather report.
"Killer Storm strikes back."

827
01:32:39,263 --> 01:32:43,308
DUNPHY [OVER TV]: <i>It shows Trent making
a deal with his underworld cronies.</i>

828
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,562
TRENT [OVER TV]: <i>You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.</i>

829
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,731
<i>Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.</i>

830
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:52,317
<i>And you can take that to the bank.</i>

831
01:32:55,654 --> 01:32:58,574
DUNPHY [OVER TV]: <i>We have the greatest
respect for Storm 's courage.</i>

832
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:02,744
TRENT: <i>You told me this dock was clean.
What the hell's going on here?</i>

833
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:05,581
TRENT:
<i>Are you people listening to me?</i>

834
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:36,148
