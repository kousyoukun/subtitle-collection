1
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,945
Come on. Let's go, guys.
I'm missing the Oscars.

2
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,873
CALABRESE:
Hey, Mikey, la Luce, the light.

3
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,983
VALERO: Calabrese, nice to see you.
CALABRESE: Nice to see you too.

4
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,396
VALERO:
This is our friend I told you about.

5
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,319
STORM:
Calabrese.

6
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,442
I know you.

7
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,035
Who are these other mystery guests?

8
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,126
CALABRESE: Murder is a very
serious business, my friend.

9
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,753
And an expensive one.

10
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,169
TRENT: You'll be very welI
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

11
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,214
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

12
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,300
You can take that to the bank.

13
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,547
CALABRESE:
Slowly. Slowly.

14
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,925
And always with caution.

15
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,229
TRENT: Listen. I want you to turn
Senator Caldwell into a memory.

16
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,933
I'm not waiting for him
to die of natural causes.

17
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,936
CALABRESE:
all I'm counseling is patience.

18
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,773
The man is public.
He's in the papers every day.

19
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,947
TRENT: Next time I read about him,
it better be the obituaries.

20
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,949
Who are you?

21
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,289
Get out of the shadows.

22
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,869
VALERO:
Enough bullshit.

23
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:23,378
VALERO: Can you do this job or not?
CALABRESE: It'll be taken care of.

24
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,962
TRENT: Gentlemen, enough bickering.
This is business.

25
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,171
TRENT:
I think we understand each other.

26
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,048
CALABRESE:
Then let's just stick to business.

27
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,720
TRENT:
It's a light plane.

28
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,143
TRENT:
A Lear P-61.

29
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,644
We want it to take off.
We don't want it to land.

30
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,483
(NOISE)

31
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,480
TRENT:
What the...

32
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,163
You told me this dock was clean.

33
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,302
Mikey. Quit playing
with yourself back there.

34
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,854
CALABRESE: Get that bastard.
TRENT: Let's get out of here.

35
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,383
I don't want him to get an hour older.

36
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,753
He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.

37
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,765
No kidding.

38
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,472
ANNOUNCER1 [OVER TV]:
And the winner is:

39
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,559
ANNOUNCER 2 [OVER TV]:
Ben Kingsley for Gandhi.

40
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,808
Amigo, are you deaf?

41
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,527
QUENTERO:
Storm on 3.

42
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,774
Thanks, Max.

43
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:13,897
QUENTERO:
Axel, line 3.

44
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,658
Throwing away dimes now?

45
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,866
This doesn't go out.
For your ears only.

46
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,247
What?

47
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,787
Calabrese.
I got his ass on film.

48
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,584
You're full of shit.

49
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:35,385
Him and his pet cockroach, Valero.
On film and audio, laying out a hit.

50
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,306
STORM [OVER PHONE]: Two guys I couldn't
make. I think they'll come up on film.

51
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,844
I think this is the big one.
Our own little Academy Award.

52
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,849
It's good. Ready?

53
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,352
- Shoot.
- Listen, Carlito.

54
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,522
Nobody but us knows about this.

55
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,323
LADY: Thanks.
STORM: You're welcome.

56
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,455
- How you doing tonight?
- What can I do for you?

57
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,700
Got any Champagne?

58
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,128
Right next to the caviar.

59
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,627
- That was funny.
- Great.

60
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,334
In the big cooler back there.

61
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,549
How come you're not watching
the Oscars tonight?

62
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,718
The Oscars?

63
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,014
Yeah, the Oscars.

64
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,595
I hate the Oscars.

65
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,435
You're not having a good time?

66
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,229
Who needs the goddamn movies?

67
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,146
COUNTERMAN:
I got a show in here every night.

68
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,061
You got horror, sex...

69
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,612
freaks, violence.

70
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,991
And I don't got to pay no 4 bucks.

71
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,658
You should film it.
Get your own show.

72
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,872
I'll be great in a porno.

73
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,003
Better dial 911.

74
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,173
PUNK 1:
You don't want to call 911.

75
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,130
Holy shit.

76
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,129
You remember me, viejo?

77
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,510
PUNK 1:
That's right.

78
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,221
You remember.

79
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,053
He grew some hair
since we last seen him.

80
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,266
PUNK 1:
Not a lot.

81
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,230
Where's the rug?

82
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,689
You know what I want.
G0 ahead.

83
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,233
Move.

84
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,524
That's my money.

85
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,278
Take my life savings.

86
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,873
Where's a cop when you need one?

87
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,452
They're out eating doughnuts.

88
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,713
I got half a mind to bash your...

89
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,183
Now you only got half a mind.

90
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,644
PUNK 2:
Take him out, man.

91
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,348
Let's go, hero.

92
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,605
PUNK 1: That's it, right here.
What are you grinning at?

93
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,397
You know...

94
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,439
there's only four of you guys...

95
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,567
and you only have one shot left.

96
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,881
Go low, man.

97
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,751
Get the maricén, man.

98
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,597
PUNK 2:
What are you doing on the ground?

99
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,939
I'll out your heart out.

100
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,726
Yeah? Come and cut my heart out.

101
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,021
Come and cut my heart out.

102
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,814
Come on, punk.

103
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,994
I know what you're thinking.
Mine's bigger than yours.

104
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,786
It's not fair.

105
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,614
I'll throw it away.

106
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,953
What if I show you
what it's like to be a victim?

107
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,632
STORM: Come on.
PUNK 2: You're fucking dead, man.

108
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,674
It's still not fair.
Okay, I'll get down on my knees.

109
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,342
Better?

110
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,553
Come get some.

111
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,560
DETECTIVE:
Looks like you won the Oscar, Storm.

112
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,284
(MUSIC OVER RADIO)

113
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,969
TRENT [OVER RADIO]: You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

114
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,217
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

115
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,507
You can take that to the bank.

116
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,009
I know that voice.

117
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,143
Is that you, honey?

118
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,354
STORM:
Yeah, baby.

119
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,348
In the flesh.

120
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,240
What are you doing?
Come on.

121
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,333
STORM:
I'm raiding the icebox.

122
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,037
I gave up my diet for Lent.

123
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,671
Champagne?

124
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,255
STORM:
Does that put you in the mood?

125
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,599
Think this could do it?

126
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,144
FELICIA: I had to bribe him to go
to bed with six cookies...

127
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,195
and a glass of orange juice.

128
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,491
I wish I could sleep like that.

129
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,826
Maybe I can help you.

130
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,450
SONNY:
Is that for me, Dad?

131
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,286
You faker.

132
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,129
Here you go.

133
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,135
There you go.

134
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:56,308
- Did you say your prayers?
- I wanted to do them with you.

135
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,601
There's a trick to getting
what you want when you say prayers.

136
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,681
What, Daddy?

137
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,937
You ask for things for other people,
like your mom and Uncle O'Malley.

138
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,402
Then how do I get stuff for myself?

139
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,408
That's why God invented work.

140
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,696
Want to say a little prayer with me?
Come here.

141
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,870
Want to say your prayers?

142
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,204
Now I lay me down to sleep.

143
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:30,008
And we say together:
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

144
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,919
If I die before I wake...

145
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,131
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

146
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,258
Amen. Very good.

147
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,350
Good night, Dad.

148
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,898
- Good night.
- Good night, Mommy.

149
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,862
STORM:
Sleep well, champ.

150
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,861
Here's to us.

151
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,546
I had a shitty day today.

152
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,804
There's blood on your shirt.

153
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,722
It's not my blood.

154
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,429
So you don't have to worry.

155
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,115
If people knew how sweet you are...

156
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,243
they'd never be scared of you.

157
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,910
I'm not scared of you.

158
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,125
Maybe you should be.

159
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,270
We'll try to squeeze it in.

160
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,272
I'm in a silly mood.

161
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,954
I love you.

162
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,247

CARSON [OVER TV]:
You don't get many chances here.

171
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,857
Apparently, Pattie said to Reagan,
"You'll love my fiancé.

172
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,895
He's a California guy
who meditates, eats brown rice...

173
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,903
and sleeps on a bed of nails."

174
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,735
Becker. Storm on 3.

Put yours in the nightstand.

176
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,592
QUENTERO:
I got it.

177
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,254
AXEL:
Fix his ass.

178
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,352
Got all the tapes?

179
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,767
QUENTERO:
A shitload. Hurry.

180
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,936
Just hurry.

181
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,107
AXEL:
Quentero. The kid.

182
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,024

183
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,871

00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,796
QUENTERO: Get your ass in the van

185
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,387

186
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,815
FEMALE REPORTER: Assemblyman Trent,
when did you meet Mason Storm?

187
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,276
TRENT:
I've known him since...

188
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,895
O'MALLEY:
Jesus Christ.

189
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,405
TRENT:
I was City Attorney...

190
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,820
and he was a young...

191
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,951
homicide detective.

192
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,654
We worked together...

193
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,830
We worked on several cases.

194
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,329
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

195
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,207
FEMALE REPORTER:
Assemblyman Vernon Trent...

196
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,423
distraught over the loss
of an officer he knew.

197
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,803
Terrible circumstances here
outside the emergency room...

198
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,178
and a calamity-filled mob scene
of policemen...

199
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,100
TRENT:
What makes people do this?

200
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,647
Would somebody please tell me that.

201
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,108
Hulland.

202
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,693
Captain Hulland.

203
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,118
DOCTOR: Coming through, please.
NURSE: Stand back, please.

204
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,199
Is he a national treasure?

205
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,873
DOCTOR:
Blood pressure's 70l40.

206
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,377
I get no pulse.

207
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,210
They always said Storm was superhuman.

208
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,380
HULLAND: Know why?
He was jacked up on coke.

209
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,473
I’ll tell you something.
He was the cleanest man I knew.

210
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,313
He had more honor than
this whole department.

211
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,524
If I ever hear you
talk that puke again...

212
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,902
I’ll put you where you belong.

213
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,317
What the fuck is L.A. doing here?

214
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,489
- Taking over the show.
- Bullshit.

215
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,068
This is Homicide, not Internal Affairs.

216
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,828
We got two cops down with
money and drugs all over.

217
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,327
This came from the commissioner.

218
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,538
Captain Hulland?

219
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,119
What?

220
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,625
Storm is dead.

221
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,136
HULLAND:
O'Malley...

222
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,188
I know you and Storm were tight.

223
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,355
For what it's worth...

224
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,442
I'm sorry.

225
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,447
The most unstoppable
son of a bitch I ever knew.

226
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,454
He got stopped tonight.

227
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,804
Excuse me.
Are you with the police?

228
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,053
Lieutenant O'Malley.
What do you got?

229
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,177
A live cop is what I've got.

230
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,808
FEMALE REPORTER: What's happening?
O'MALLEY: No comment. It's over.

231
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,438
DOCTOR:
We've got a pulse.

232
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,199
Your man's alive, lieutenant.

233
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,826
Who else knows he isn't dead?

234
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,737
Just the people in here.

235
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,989
I want to see each of them.

236
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,918
And no one else Comes in here
as of now. You got that?

237
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,338
DOCTOR:
Lieutenant, this is still a hospital.

238
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,674
I appreciate your problem.

239
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,015
But I'm acting under orders
of the police commissioner.

240
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,184
- I hope you can document that.
- I can and will.

241
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:07,271
Mason Storm's going to vanish,
and you’ll help make that happen.

242
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:12,606
Till he can give us some answers,
the deader he is, the safer he is.

243
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,704
O'MALLEY: Don't worry, buddy.
I'm in your Comer.

244
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,954

What do we got?
"inquiring minds want to know"?

252
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,813
Doctor Carlin's ordered
a glucose drip for Jimmy C.

253
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,734
Max's E.E.G. monitor's

00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,443
Poor Max.

290
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,478
What's the change?

291
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,320
The patient has come out
of a coma after seven years.

00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,682
How's it going, brother?

321
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,687
Who are you?

322
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:29,648
I'm Danny, the physical therapist.
I'm going to give you a massage.

323
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,605
DANNY: I’ll make you feel all right.
STORM: Get the fuck out.

324
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,986
I’ll just take you down the hall.

325
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,197
NURSE: Thank you.
- Anytime.

326
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:43,791
WOMAN: Dr. Mathews,
call Coma Research, please.

327
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,286
AXEL: Can I see your list of patients
in your coma care unit?

328
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,662
Yes, doctor.

329
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:57,839
STORM: Get me out. Thanks for the
massage, but get me out of here.

330
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,516
Just relax. You’ll get out
of here real soon, I promise.

331
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,767
- Morning, Sheri. How you doing?
- Morning. Good.

332
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,563
Thank you.

333
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,648
Thank you.

334
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,366
- You know that doctor?
- No.

335
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,917
AXEL:
John Doe.

336
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,518
SECURITY:
Excuse me.

337
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,016
Doctor?

338
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,275
I have to check everyone
on these floors.

339
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,107
Can I get your ID, please?

340
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,327
You can't have too much security.

341
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,547
If you feel up to it, I’ll get you some
lemon chiffon pie out of the freezer.

342
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,210
STORM:
Get me out of here.

343
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,626
DANNY: Don't worry.
I’ll take good care of you.

344
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,428
If you want, I’ll hook you up
with some pizza.

345
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,843
You got to learn to relax.

346
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,471
Orderly.
Give me a little help.

347
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,978
Give me some help down here.

348
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,860
DANNY:
What's he doing down there?

349
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,896
DAN NY:
What's wrong?

350
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,823
Russ.

351
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,532
What happened?

352
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,488
He's dead.

353
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,204
AN DY:
My poor back.

354
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,460
AXEL:
You son of a bitch.

355
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,971
AXEL:
Storm, you son of a bitch.

356
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,240
Oh, my God.

357
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,250
Russ. Danny.

358
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,615
AXEL:
I’ll get you, Storm.

359
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,727
J.D.

360
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,483
AN DY:
Oh, my God.

361
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,653
Now will you listen to me?

362
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,154
AN DY:
Hold tight.

363
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,410
Sorry.

364
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,579
AXEL:
Stop.

365
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,164
AN DY:
Hang on.

366
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,086
AXEL:
Watch out.

367
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,413
Get out of the way.

368
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,695
TRENT: Ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to put a stop to it...

369
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,830
and we're going to start right here.

370
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,124
We are going to put an end...

371
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:32,334
to violence in this state.
And you can take that to the bank.

372
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,717
Hulland, plaster Storm's ass
with slime in the press.

373
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:44,013
Make him responsible for that
hospital mess. Tail people he knows.

374
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,847
HULLAND:
We know how to do our job.

375
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,852
Then show me. I'm starring in the
son of a bitch's home movies.

376
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,480
If that crap gets out,
I'm looking at 30 years.

377
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,075
Geraldo.

378
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,411
Who's this guy?

379
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,548
Our program came to an
unexpectedly violent conclusion.

380
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,939
Are you crazy?
I can't Come in to work.

381
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,106
I can't even go
to my apartment, Martha.

382
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,107
People are dead.

383
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,000
MARTHA [OVER PHONE]:
Then where are you?

384
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,079
I can't tell you. Besides,
you're better off not knowing.

385
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,792
ANNOUNCER [OVER TV]: Senator Vernon
Trent promises no new taxes.

386
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,798
And you can take that to the bank.

387
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,759
What'll I do with this guy?
I want to help him...

388
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,892
but he's all over TV.
He's a crooked cop involved in...

389
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,393
Why are you out of bed?

390
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,860
I've got you.

391
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,983
DUNPHY [OVER TV]:
Police speculate that Storm...

392
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:03,368
who is known to have ties
with criminal elements...

393
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,495
could have involved
his contacts in his escape.

394
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,166
Storm was thought to have been
a murder victim. A casualty...

395
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,370
of his own greed.
A widespread search is now being...

396
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,094
This is Mason Storm. I'd like
to speak with Jerry Dunphy.

397
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,183
No, it's not a joke.

398
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,515
We can't stay here.
They'll trace us from the hospital.

399
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,394
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm house-sitting.

400
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,529
It belongs to a friend of my parents.

401
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,525
He's in China on
research for six months.

402
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,153
The medical center
only has my apartment address.

403
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,452
Not even my friends have this number.

404
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,835
You've got to believe me.

405
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,333
You're safe here, okay?

406
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,545
DUNPHY [OVER TV]: This reporter was
contacted personally by the "Coma Cop

407
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,513
"fugitive officer Mason Storm...

408
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,842
who, until days ago,
had been in a seven-year coma.

409
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:13,893
Storm said he's innocent of charges
made against him in the press...

410
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,732
and that he has
indisputable proof of this.

411
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,733
He has promised me a first look
at his alleged proof.

412
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,734
I want 24-hour surveillance
on that son of a bitch...

413
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,448
and those two nurses
from the hospital.

414
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,215
No, I can do it myself.

415
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,255
You do it then.

416
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,104
You give me this beard?

417
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,108
You tried.

418
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,797
- You ever been to Chinatown?
- Yeah. Why?

419
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:27,053
This is a list of herbs and needles
that I need for my recovery.

420
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,639
Where did you learn to write Chinese?

421
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:36,221
When I was a kid, my dad was a
missionary. I was raised in the Orient.

422
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,806
As a young white boy over there...

423
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,652
I needed to learn how to fight,
as you can imagine.

424
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,145
I remember...

425
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,489
my first martial arts teacher
said to me:

426
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,243
"So why do you Come to me?"

427
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,163
I say,
"To learn how to fight."

428
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,245
And he says,
"S0 you want to hurt people.

429
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,994
But do you want to be great?"
L say, "Yeah.

430
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,918
I want to be great."

431
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:08,633
He says, "Then first learn how
to heal people to be great.

432
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,510
To hurt people is easy."

433
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,367
Look at you.
You look great.

434
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,697
Like it?

435
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,221
That's enough.
Why don't you go sit down?

436
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,816
That bad?

437
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,232
If you need me,
I'll be in the outer room.

438
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,230
STORM: O'Malley's the key.
We must find him.

439
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:56,739
ANDY: You can't compare blood pressure
now with when you're in a coma.

440
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,320
What's this?
555 over four digits.

441
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,573
ANDY: That's crazy.
Let me see that.

442
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,831
Martha's chicken scratches.
She probably can't even read them.

443
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,746
- You know what it is?
- What?

444
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,827
It's a phone number.

445
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,887
Hello.

446
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,901
When you phoned I asked
everyone here at the home...

447
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:45,698
and there is no O'Malley here.
But it is possible...

448
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,326
O'Malley is a relation
of someone here.

449
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:54,831
Why not leave me your number and
I'll call you if there's any contact.

450
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,879
Can I phone you?

451
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,711
Of course, my dear.

452
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,099
- Here, let me do that.
- That's all right.

453
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,472
It's okay.

454
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,265
Thank you.

455
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,994
You old devil.

456
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,987
Mason Storm.

457
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,932
Hi. I'm sorry.

458
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,474
I don't mean to interrupt.

459
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,224
I was just passing by and I thought...

460
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,943
you might like a flower.

461
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,337
AN DY:
I like that.

462
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,568
STORM:
Now I lay me down to sleep...

463
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,565
Now we say it together, okay?

464
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,613
STORM & SONNY:
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

465
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,407
If I die before I wake...

466
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,491
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

467
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,456
MARTHA'S VOICE [OVER PHONE]: This is
Allartha Coe. I can't come to the phone...

468
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,007
Pick up, Martha.
Please pick up.

469
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,510
ANDY: Are you there?
I'm coming over.

470

AN DY [OVER SPEAKER]:
Are you there? I'm coming over.

471
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,707
HULLAND:
You called it right, Axel.

472
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,377
Our girlfriend just showed up.

473
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,481
Martha, open up.
It's me.

474
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,938
NEIGHBOR:
What's up?

475
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,193
Hi.

476
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,518
NEIGHBOR:
Looking for Martha?

477
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,488
You know where she is?

478
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,323
You haven't seen the news?

479
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,209
She's dead.

480
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,212
She was strangled over in Westwood.

481
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,711
Know something?

482
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,302
You look like the bitch
whose picture's on TV.

483
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,845
The one whose house they found her at.

484
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,594
Hey, get over here.

485
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,437
HULLAND:
Okay, boys, mount up.

486
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,876
WOMAN:
Ernie, you forgot my buttermilk.

487
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,373
Shit.

488
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,858
O'MALLEY:
Storm.

489
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,870
O'Malley.

490
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,715
O'MALLEY:
That's Sonny, all right.

491
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,310
The kid's a track star.

492
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,888
He does the hundred in 11 flat.

493
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:52,563
He's going to be real fast,
like his old man was.

494
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,318
What do you mean "was"?

495
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,025
I'm not over the hill.

496
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,406
At least, I hope not.

497
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,860
How'd you pull this off?

498
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,371
He made it to my house
the night you were shot.

499
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,792
I got him hidden, played it out
like he was dead...

500
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,420
staged his funeral
with yours and Felicia's.

501
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,789
Everybody bought it.

502
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,337
Where is he?
Is he safe?

503
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,762
Ventura Trinity Prep School,
under my mother's maiden name, Wade.

504
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,102
No one has any idea that he's your son.

505
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,472
S0 that was your mother that Andy found.

506
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:36,478
Your nurse friend? Yeah.
She left a number and I traced you here.

507
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,780
I don't know how to thank you.

508
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,078
I have no words.

509
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,999
Just seeing your ugly ass alive
is enough for me.

510
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,265
That night in the hospital...

511
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,177
I found the audio tape in your vest.

512
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,685
I must've played that tape 1000 times...

513
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:18,611
looking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

514
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:19,941
Nada.

515
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,780
STORM:
Where is the tape?

516
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,195
- I turned it in for evidence.
- What?

517
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,867
Don't worry, I made a dupe.

518
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,117
Meanwhile, I thought you'd
take some pleasure in this.

519
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,367
O'MALLEY:
And there's more in the car.

520
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,707
You were not wrong, my friend.

521
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,836
You were not wrong.

522
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,676
What's happened to you?

523
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,232
O'MALLEY: I was on the case
maybe a year and a half...

524
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,943
trying to find out
who pulled the trigger.

525
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,322
But it was like swimming through shit.

526
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,252
Everywhere I turned,
people told me to back off, get lost.

527
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,079
Then one morning the phone rings.

528
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,373
Immaculate Heart Emergency.

529
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,052
Someone ran my mother off the road.

530
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,176
Her back's broken.
She's paralyzed.

531
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,717
STORM:
I'm sorry, O'Mal.

532
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:38,933
O'MALLEY: That night, there's a note in
my locker telling me it's no accident.

533
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,773
What the hell could I do?

534
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,110
I've got my hands tied behind
my back. I can't wave or salute.

535
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,618
S0 I put my papers in.

536
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:52,989
Took a three-quarter pension.

537
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,538
You know me,
I never would have backed off.

538
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,955
But there was Sonny to worry about.
What if they found him?

539
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,375
- Or you?
- No, you did the right thing.

540
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,460
Then wasn't the time.

541
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,087
Now's the time.

542
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,428
We're outgunned and undermanned,
but We're going to win.

543
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,389
And I'll tell you why.

544
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:18,393
Supefioraüüude,
superior state of mind.

545
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,894
We'll get them, buddy.

546
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,737
Believe me.

547
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,323
Every fucking one of them.

548
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:59,347
One more favor:
Get Sonny out of that school now.

549
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:04,276
With me up and running, they'll
do anything to find Sonny to get to me.

550
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,862
Get him someplace safe, anywhere.

551
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,780
O'MALLEY:
Consider it done.

552
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,117
I'm going straight to get that film.

553
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,786
As soon as you get that audio,
and Sonny's safe...

554
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,205
we'll bring it in to Jerry Dunphy.

555
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,207
We'll see quite a show on the news.

556
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,835
You got it, partner.

557
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,717
O'MALLEY: I must've played that tape
1000 times...

558
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:38,094
looking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

559
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,389
STORM: Two guys I couldn’t make out,
but they'll come up on the film.

560
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,350
TRENT: You can take that to the bank.
STORM: I know that voice.

561
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:50,360
AN DY: Your charts go back seven years.
Do you have any recollection of anything?

562
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,911
STORM: I have them on the same film in
the same camera, right where I left it.

563
01:00:56,236 --> 01:01:00,833
ANNOUNCER: Senator Vernon Trent
promises no new taxes.

564
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,872
TRENT:
And you can take that to the bank.

565
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,332
Money now, and lots more
when I'm in office.

566
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,584
And you can take that to the bank.

567
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:16,006
I'm going to take you to the bank,
Senator Trent.

568
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,266
To the blood bank.

569
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,428
Martha's dead.

570
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:00,680
I'm sorry.

571
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,563
It's all right.

572
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,487
O'Malley was here today.

573
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,821
He was?
How did he get here?

574
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,826
You found him.
The old lady was his mother.

575
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:31,082
My son's alive.

576
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:40,261
We better get out of here.
Really. Let's go.

577
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:45,266
ANDY: This ain't going to be
my best packing job.

578
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,370
Where are we going?

579
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,039
Out of here.

580
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,117
ANDY:
I'll be glad when all this is over.

581
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,789
Where's my bathrobe?

582
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,665
ANDY: I hope it fits in the suitcase.
STORM: Get my jeans and a jacket.

583
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,386
STORM: Hurry up.
ANDY: I'm just about done.

584
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,635
Mason.

585
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,391
Get down.

586
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,035
It's jammed.

587
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,419
AN DY:
Look behind you.

588
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,199
Let's go.

589
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,129
Get down.

590
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,138
Come quick.
Let's go.

591
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,580
AXEL:
I'll slit your throat.

592
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,299
You're going to bleed like a pig.

593
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,176
They're out back.

594
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,094
We're on them.

595
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,039
STORM:
Hang on.

596
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,382
Hulland.
You son of a bitch.

597
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,916
ANDY:
I forgot to lock the door.

598
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,979
MAN 1:
Oh, man. The battery's all corroded.

599
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,977
MAN 2:
Hey, man, be cool. What's this?

600
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,605
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

601
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,442
You like my coche?

602
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,199
How hot is it, homes?

603
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,868
Smoking.

604
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,455
You got it.

605
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,416
MAN 1:
There's bullet holes in the glass.

606
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,502
MAN 2: This Jeep looks like it's
been in a war, man.

607
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,310
Maybe you should wear
these kind of clothes all the time.

608
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:46,522
Only next time,
we'll use your credit card.

609
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,577
Daddy, I don't want you to go.

610
01:07:56,322 --> 01:08:00,168
ANDY: You look really great for someone
who changed in a gas station.

611
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,502
Thanks.

612
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:06,796
ANDY: We're from Hillstar Real Estate.
We can market your home effectively.

613
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:10,049
We aren't even thinking about selling.

614
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,013
In fact, we're adding a nursery.

615
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,806
It's a mess.

616
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,760
- I'd love to see the nursery.
- Over here.

617
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,183
We don't know if it's a girl or a boy...

618
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,347
so we did a splatter effect.

619
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,614
FELICIA: What are you doing?
STORM: Raiding the icebox.

620
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,002
The plasterer might have fallen.

621
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,711
AN DY:
What about your baby?

622
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,726
STORM:
Just the way I left you.

623
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:04,982
Good grief.

624
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,731
I'm sorry, but I think your
contractor's doing a lousy job.

625
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,733
These things happen.

626
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,411
STORM:
Thank God.

627
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,171
Hang on, Mrs. O'Malley.

628
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,091
O'Malley left there
three hours ago with the tape.

629
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,256
It doesn't matter about the tape.

630
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:39,392
We have to get this film
to Dunphy's studio...

631
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,853
before I have a nervous breakdown.

632
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,930
Mrs. O'Malley, listen.

633
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:47,226
I'm across from the Bonaventure Hotel.

634
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,686
I need you to do me a favor.

635
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:54,362
Have O'Malley deliver a message
to the desk under Andrea Smith.

636
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,285
No, we're not checking in.
That's too dangerous.

637
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:01,532
But the desk will hold the message
if you tell them we're coming in later.

638
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,457
all right? Thanks.

639
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,624

642
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,712
and leave a message...

643
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,009
at the desk.

644
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:18,798
Baby, that's beautiful.

645
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,971
I love it.

646
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,994
SONNY:
Where's my glove, Uncle Mal?

647
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,498
Take it easy.
Sonny, hurry up, dear.

648
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,129
Sonny, forget the mitt.
We got to get going.

649
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,838
The number for the

O'MALLEY:
When this is over...

651
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,925
you, me and your pop
will rent a boat...

652
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:06,513
and catch the biggest fish.
I'm not talking goldfish either.

653
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,725
SONNY:
The last time I went fishing with Pop...

654
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,851
we caught an old tire.

655
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:16,197
O'MALLEY: Not this time, Sonny.
We'll get us a big, fat tuna.

656
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:17,861
It's them.

657
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,529
Let's go.

Captain Hulland, I.A.P.D.

661
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:47,896
I need to check any messages
for an Andrea Smith.

662
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,085
Here you are, sir.

663
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,090
Good evening, sir.

664
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:36,277
Do you have any messages
for an Andrea Smith, please?

665
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,127
Don't worry, Sonny's okay.

666
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:04,472
He's with O'Malley, who has the tape.
They're headed for Union Station.

667
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:08,344
Great. Let's go get the car.
Just a minute.

668
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,767
ANDY: What's wrong?
- Shit.

669
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,060
Fuck.

Hey. You can't do that in Dallas.

That's a rented car.

wobble a bit from time to time.

Watch out for the hot dog.
Don't spill mustard.

Sonny...

690
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:33,078
I know it's hard to put together
after all these years.

691
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:38,209
I'm sorry I told you your dad
was dead. I thought it was best.

692
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,995
I know it's awkward.

693
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,294
But your father loves you very much.

694
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,385
You've got to get to know each
other again. It'll take time.

695
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,384
Now listen up.

696
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:54,763
If your dad gets here on schedule,
you both get on the train.

697
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,603
If he doesn't, you'll be going alone.

698
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,023
One of us will be one step behind.
Don't worry.

699
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,987
One step behind.

700
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,733
Just like we planned in the car
on the way here.

701
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,996
O'Malley, long time no see.

702
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,329
Make sure your father gets this.

703
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,673
Are you taking a trip?

704
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:31,629
Yeah, me and my kid are visiting
my mother in New Mexico.

705
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,344
That's your son?

706
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,177
Funny, he doesn't look much like you.

707
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,642
Does he, Quentero?

708
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:42,849
As a matter of fact...

709
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:46,068
I think I've seen
his ugly face before.

710
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,654
Kind of looks like Mason Storm.

711
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:57,285
Enough of this fucking around.
We want the tape.

712

I got to tell you.

770

You can't do this.
It wasn't me.

771

Maybe you're behind this painting.

No. You're so good at this, Vernon.

776

Maybe you're under the bed.

No, not under the bed.

How do you like this, Vernon?

782
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:30,532
I'd like to kill you so bad,
L can barely contain myself.

783
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,204
But I've been thinking.

784
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,545
Death is far too merciful
a fate for you.

785
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,755
S0 what I'm going to do is...

786
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,047
put you in prison.

787
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:45,256
A nice petite white boy like you
in a federal penitentiary...

788
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:50,599
Let me put it this way: You won't be
able to stay anal-retentive very long.

789
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,772
I'm going to take
these handcuffs here...

then I'll arrest you and
I'll take you in. How's that?

791
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,339
Come on. What are you doing?

792
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,458
No, please. No.

793
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,502
No. No.

794
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,129
(GUNSHOT)

795
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,434
I missed.

796
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,346
I never miss.

797
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:37,690
They must have been smaller
than I thought.

798
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,607
Freeze.

799
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,523
OFFICER:
Drop the gun. Slowly.

800
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,409
Get on your knees
with your hands in the air.

801
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,782
TRENT: Thank God.
Thank God you guys are here.

802
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,822
Do it now.

803
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:55,954
TRENT:
You got to stop him.

804
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:02,879
Let me go. Storm, no.

805
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,511
SERGEANT:
Storm.

806
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:09,673
SERGEANT: Storm, no.
Hold it right there.

807
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,472
TRENT: Sergeant, talk to him.
Tell him to let me go.

808
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:20,229
Give me the gun.

809
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,648
SERGEANT:
Give me the gun.

810
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,402
Give me the gun.

811
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:35,407
We saw the film.

812
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,955
We know you were set up.

813
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,250
SERGEANT:
Senator, you're under arrest.

814
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:43,878
Cuff him.

815
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,340
TRENT:
What the hell are you talking about?

816
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:51,886
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me.

817
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:56,265
I'm a senator, for Christ's sake.
You can't do this to me.

818
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,526
We're sorry, Storm.

819
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,947
You're a dead man, Storm.

820
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:11,614
Do you hear me.
You won't get away with this.

821
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,783
Dad.Dad.

822
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,539
SONNY: Are you all right?
ANDY: I love you, Storm.

823
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:20,122
TRENT:
I'm the senator.

824
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,788
STORM:
How about a nice vacation?

825
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,054
OFFICER:
This guy is going to be famous.

826
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:39,013
I can hear tomorrow's weather report.
"Killer Storm strikes back."

827
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:43,312
DUNPHY [OVER TV]: I2' shows Trent making
a deal with his underworld cronies.

828
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,570
TRENT [OVER TV]: You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

829
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,739
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

830
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,325
And you can take that to the bank.

831
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:58,577
DUNPHY [OVER TV]: We have the greatest
respect for Storm's courage.

832
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:02,748
TRENT: You told me this dock was clean.
What the hell's going on here?

833
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,580
TRENT:
Are you people listening to me?

834
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,147
