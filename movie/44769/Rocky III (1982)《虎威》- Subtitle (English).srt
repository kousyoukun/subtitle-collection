Right. I waited
at your house for
about an hour

you might be here.

If the papers knew
we were talking
like this,

we was crazy.

Why?
(SCOFFS) Well, to be
honest with you,

1039

I don't think
you could pull it off
without me, Rock.

1040
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,883
You still didn't give
me the answer, Apollo.
What's the real reason?

I could promote this
thing into the biggest

from nothing or nobody,

knows that hurt.

so don't back off now.

yourself or you'll
be sorry you didn't.

all messed up inside.

you didn't look
hungry.

Now, when we fought,

1061

you had that eye
of the tiger, man,

1062

And now you
gotta get it back.

back is to go back
to the beginning.

what I mean?

it back together.

1067
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,099
Why'd you have
to come here?

1068
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,519
I have the plan.
Get back, man.

1069
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,357
You got me curious.

1070
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,361
You got me curious, Rock.

1071
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:37,161
Clubber, do you accept
the challenge for
a rematch with Balboa?

1072
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:40,623
I reject the challenge,
because Balboa is
no challenge.

1073
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,167
But I'd be more than
happy to beat up on
him some more.

he was nothing.

that old fool,

I'm gonna close it
for him.

1083
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,688
All right. When will
the match take place?

1084
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:04,939

the better.

of the world.

1086
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,692
And nothing can
be done about that.

and I won't be beat.

train even harder.

quick knockdowns.

1090

him real bad.

making a comeback at 34

1094
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,251
are very long indeed.

passed. I wish him luck.

to it, Rock.

owe me a big favor.

01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,062
Why did you come here?

1333
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:18,899
I just don't
want it no more.

1334
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:22,402
If it's over because
you want it to be over,
I'm glad.

1335
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,196
I do.

1336
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:29,326
It's just, you've never
quit anything since
I've known you.

1337
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,707
I don't know what
you want me to say.

1338
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,876
I mean, how?
What happened?

1339
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:41,046
How did everything
that was so good
get so bad?

1340
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,174
What's so bad?
Tell me, what?

1341
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:47,427
I wrecked everything
by not thinking for
myself.

1342
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:49,680
I mean, why couldn't
Mickey tell me where
I was really at,

1343
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,014
right from the start?

1344
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:52,724
He didn't have to
carry me and lie to me

1345
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,769
and make me think I was
better than I really was
when I wasn't.

1346
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,229
He never lied.

1347
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,481
Those fights weren't right.
They weren't, Adrian.

1348
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,441
I never fought anybody
who was in their prime.

1349
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,944
There was always some
angle to hold on to
the title

1350
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,779
longer than
I should have
had it.

1351
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,698
I mean, do you understand
what I'm saying here?

1352
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:10,492
I understand. But you've
gotta understand that
he loved you,

1353
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,369
and that was his job,
protecting you.

1354
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,454
Well, that protecting
don't help nothing.

1355
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:15,831
It only makes
things worse.

1356
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:19,376
You wake up after a few years
thinking you're a winner,
but you're not.

1357
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,919
You're really a loser.

1358
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,839
And so we wouldn't have
had the title as long.
So what?

1359
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,716
At least it
would've been
real, Adrian.

1360
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,050
It was real.

1361
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,845
Nothing is real
if you don't believe
in who you are.

1362
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,431
I don't believe
in myself no more.
Don't you understand?

1363
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:33,890
When a fighter don't
believe, that's it.

1364
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,851
He's finished.
It's over. That's it.

1365
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,602
That's not it!
That is it!

1366
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,104
Why don't you
tell me the truth!

1367
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,314
What are you putting
me through, Adrian?

1368
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:42,524
You wanna know the truth?

1369
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,526
The truth is,
I don't want to
lose what I got.

1370
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,403
In the beginning,
I didn't care about
what happened to me.

1371
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,947
I'd go in a ring,
I'd get busted up,
I didn't care.

1372
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,907
But now there's you,
there's the kid.

1373
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,325
I don't wanna
lose what I got!

1374
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,995
What do we have
that can't be
replaced? What?

1375
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:58,123
A house?
We got cars.
We got money.

1376
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,208
We got everything
but the truth!

1377
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,877
What's the truth,
damn it?

1378
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,379
I'm afraid, all right?

1379
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:05,630
You wanna hear
me say it?

1380
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,841
You wanna break me
down? All right,
I'm afraid!

1381
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,926
For the first time in
my life, I'm afraid.

1382
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,470
I'm afraid, too!

1383
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,929
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid.

1384
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,431
There is.
For me there is!

1385
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:15,891
Why? You're human,
aren't you?

1386
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,518
Look, I don't know
what I am. All I know
is I'm a liar,

1387
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,604
and because of that
Mickey ain't here no more.

1388
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,647
You didn't push
him into anything!

1389
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:25,400
He was a grown man
and he did what
he had to do.

1390
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:28,904
And you have no right
to feel guilty for what
happened, you don't!

1391
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:31,656
You were a champion.
And you did what you
were expected to do.

1392
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,618
You did what I and
everybody else thought
you should do.

1393
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:37,662
And you wanna tell me
that those fights weren't
real? That you were carried?

1394
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,081
Well, I don't
believe it!

1395
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,457
But it doesn't
matter what
I believe.

1396
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,668
Because you're the one
that's gotta carry that
fear around inside you.

1397
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,755
Afraid that everybody's
gonna take things away.

1398
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,965
Afraid you're gonna
be remembered as
a coward,

1399
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,218
that you're not
a man anymore.

1400
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:54,554
Well, none of it's true,
but it doesn't matter
if I tell you.

1401
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:57,766
It doesn't matter,
because you're the one
that's gotta settle it.

1402
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:58,934
Get rid of it!

1403
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,977
Because when all
the smoke has cleared

1404
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,063
and everyone's through
chanting your name,

1405
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,940
it's just gonna be us!

1406
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,233
And you can't
live like this.

1407
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:08,235
We can't live like this.

1408
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:10,612
Because it's gonna
bother you for the
rest of your life.

1409
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,031
Look what it's
doing to you now.

1410
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,998
Apollo thinks you
can do it. So do I.

1411
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,627
But you. You've gotta
wanna do it for the
right reasons.

1412
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,504
Not for the guilt
over Mickey,

1413
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,173
not for the people,
not for the title,

1414
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,676
not for money or me,
but for you.

1415
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,804
Just you,
just you alone.

1416
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,852
And if I lose?

1417
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:45,397
Then you lose,
but at least you lose
with no excuses.

1418
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,483
No fear.

1419
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:51,069
And I know you
could live with that.

But it makes all
the sense in the world.

1816
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:41,675
You owe me a favor.

1817
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,595
I know, but when did
you think of this?

1818
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,430
About three years ago.

1819
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:48,349
This is very crazy, Apollo.

1820
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:49,516
Look, Stallion.

1821
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:52,478
Now look, when you
won that last fight,
you won by one second.

1822
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:54,188
You beat me by one
second. One second.

1823
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:56,273
That's very
hard for a man of my
intelligence to handle.

1824
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:59,818
Is it? But didn't you
say after I beat you, you
learned how to live with it?

1825
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:01,779
I lied.
Oh, you lied.

1826
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:03,030
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1827
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,407
So now you just gotta
prove it to yourself?

1828
01:35:05,492 --> 01:35:06,492
Just for myself.

1829
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:08,702
No TV,
no newspapers,
just you and me.

1830
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:10,204
Nothing.
Just you and me.

1831
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:11,663
Age before beauty.

1832
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:12,956
Anything you say,
Stallion.

1833
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,708
I'll do all the work,
okay.

1834
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,211
I'll tell you, Apollo,
you better go slow

1835
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:19,546
because you ain't as young
as springtime anymore.

1836
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:22,007
I'm still young enough
to whip your butt, Stallion.

1837
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:24,176
Oh, yeah?
Well, how you
gonna do that?

1838
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,803
You taught me
everything you know.

1839
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,471
Almost everything.

1840
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,515
You gotta
remember now,
you fight great,

1841
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:32,101
but I'm a great fighter.
You ready?

1842
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:34,061
Absolutely.

1843
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,312
All right.

1844
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:38,857
You know,
Stallion, it's too bad
we gotta get old, huh?

1845
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:40,859
(LAUGHING)

1846
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,153
Just keep punching, Apollo.

1847
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,740
Wanna ring the bell?

1848
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,325
All right.

1849
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:49,952
Ding, ding.

1850
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:53,330
Come on, Stallion.

1851
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:56,417
Come on. Come on.

1852
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:59,586
Boy, you really move
good for an older guy.

1853
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,339
You're looking good,
Stallion.

1854
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:03,966
I taught you well.

1855
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:06,009
I think you
taught me too good.

1856
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:08,053
Looking fly.
Look out now.

1857
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:09,763
No, no.
You don't want any of this.

1858
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:11,515
Come on. Come on.

1859
01:36:12,225 --> 01:36:14,059
Maybe I'm in here
with the wrong guy.

1860
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,727
Come on,
watch yourself.
Ready?

1861
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:17,229
(BELL DINGS)

1862
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:20,524
(MAN SINGING)
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight

1863
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:24,945
Risin' up to the challenge
of our rival

1864
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:25,237
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

1865
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:29,366
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

1866
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:36,290
And he's watchin' us all
with the eye of the tiger

1867
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:43,380
Risin' up back on the street

1868
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:47,217
Did my time, took my chances

1869
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,680
Went the distance,
now I'm back on my feet

1870
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:55,559
Just a man and
his will to survive

1871
01:36:56,644 --> 01:37:00,439
So many times,
it happens too fast

1872
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:04,234
You trade your
passion for glory

1873
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:09,239
Don't lose your grip
on the dreams of the past

1874
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:13,452
You must fight
just to keep them alive

1875
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:17,915
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight

Risin' up to the challenge

And he's watchin' us all

Face to face, out in the heat

1880

Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry

1881
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:49,029
They stack the odds
till we take to the street

1882
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:52,866
For we kill with
the skill to survive

1883
01:37:52,951 --> 01:37:57,663
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight

Risin' up, straight to the top

Have the guts, got the glory

1889
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:32,447
Went the distance,
now I'm not gonna stop

1890
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:36,994
Just a man and
his will to survive

Of the tiger

1896
01:39:09,861 --> 01:39:12,237
The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger
