Do you know how much
I love you?

2
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,280
No.

3
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:51,589
More than all the sand
on all the beaches

4
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,200
in all the world.

5
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,813
Describe her to me again.

6
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,685
What was she like?

7
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,776
She had long hair,
a beautiful smile.

8
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,953
She wore a pretty blue dress
that shined in the sun.

9
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,173
What about this?

10
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:13,698
She loved it
and wore it every day.

11
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,352
Just like you.

12
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:17,963
Was she pretty?

13
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,531
Very pretty.
The prettiest.

14
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,272
Did she love us?

15
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:23,839
Always.

16
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:27,538
I am not going
to tell you both again.

17
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,192
All right?

18
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,585
I put you in here,

19
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,413
and I want no talking.

20
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,893
And I don't want you
to think about leaving

21
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,286
this fucking closet.

22
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,636
Do I make myself
crystal clear?

23
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,508
Yes, Daddy.

24
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,381
And don't make me come back
one more time,

25
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,818
because if I do, I swear to God
I'll grab that necklace

26
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,820
from around your fucking neck
so fast.

27
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:54,086
Now cover your ears,
both of youse.

28
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:05,750
I wish Mommy was here.

29
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,361
Come on.

30
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,145
Now I lay me down to sleep.

31
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,930
Pray the Lord my soul to keep.

32
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,106
If I should die before I wake,

33
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,326
pray the Lord
my soul to take.

34
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,242
God bless Mommy,
God bless Daddy,

35
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:21,113
God bless the house.

36
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,817
What are you doing, silly?

37
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,341
You have a better chance
of going to heaven than I do.

38
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:34,083
I wish you would
take me with you.

39
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,012
I like it.

40
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,246
Jordan.

41
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,443
Ashley.

42
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:32,315
Ashley.

43
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,391
Unbelievable.

44
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,218
Kids?

45
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,959
You had kids in here?

46
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,831
You son of a bitch.

47
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:12,094
- What are you talking about?
- You're so disgusting.

48
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,226
Rosemary, wait. Don't. Don't go.

49
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,841
What did I tell you two?

50
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,321
Eh?

51
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,951
- Good morning.
- Morning.

52
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,867
You slept on the couch again.
Is your bed not comfortable?

53
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,956
My bed was shaking.

54
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,392
Shaking?

55
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,915
Maybe we had
another tremor.

56
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,444
I have an idea.

57
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:00,011
Why don't you come to church
with me today.

58
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,491
Um...

59
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,014
I have so much
I need to get done

60
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,799
before school tomorrow.

61
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,931
Okay, well, I'm going to try
again next week.

62
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,413
I'll see you
when I get home.

63
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:11,806
Please eat something, okay?

64
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,143
Hello?

65
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,153
Aunt Tanya,
are you here?

66
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,334
Hello?

67
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,642
The Lord says,

68
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,644
if your sins be a scarlet,

69
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,124
let them be made
white as snow.

70
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:21,996
And if they be red as crimson,

71
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,998
they shall be made
white as wool.

72
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,826
So it is important
to both forgive

73
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,610
and allow forgiveness

74
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,917
in order to receive
God's true blessings.

75
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,223
So remember that next time
someone swoops in

76
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,964
and steals your front-row
parking spot

77
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,097
at the grocery store.

78
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,186
Just like Mrs. Johnson
forgave me last night

79
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:41,145
when I accidentally swooped in
and stole her spot.

80
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,626
My bad, Mrs. Johnson.

81
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,628
And speaking of blessings,

82
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,762
I'm truly blessed to be welcomed
into this church community

83
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,807
with such loving
and open arms.

84
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,331
You've really made
this transition

85
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,725
this past two months
an easy one.

86
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,075
And I'm especially blessed

87
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,861
to receive the spiritual
guidance

88
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,776
and leadership
of Reverend Michael.

89
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,134
Seems like we had
a good turnout today.

90
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,614
Yes, we did.

91
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,660
I thought you did very well.

92
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,619
I just need
to put together some readings

93
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,925
for the next youth meeting.

94
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:25,102
I see you found a title
for my personal collection.

95
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,018
Oh. Um...

96
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,498
yes, sorry.

97
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,500
It just caught my eye.

98
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,937
Well, that's okay.
Could you put it back, please?

99
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,417
Absolutely.

100
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,291
I didn't know that you were
into demonology and exorcism.

101
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,467
I was.

102
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,817
Well, I find it fascinating...

103
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,428
Some books are best left
on the shelf.

104
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,951
Of course.

105
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,615
All right, well, I'm off.

106
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,182
See you later.

107
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,705
Good sermon.

108
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:02,319
Ashley.

109
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:05,801
Ashley?

110
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,327
Hello?

111
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:17,508
Hey.

112
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,510
You don't remember me,
do you?

113
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,034
It's Hannah.

114
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,342
Hey.

115
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,953
It's amazing.
You look exactly the same,

116
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,781
except older and taller.

117
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,218
Do I look the same?

118
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,567
You're taller.

119
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,962
Where did you guys
end up going?

120
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,920
You kind of just disappeared.

121
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,401
It's messed up how we didn't
even get to say goodbye.

122
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,751
Yeah, we went up north.

123
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,755
That's a cute necklace.
Where did you get it?

124
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,192
- It's so vintage.
- Thanks. It was my mom's.

125
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,933
It's cool.

126
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,980
How's your sister?
Where's she at nowadays?

127
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,460
She's good, she got
a scholarship to Penn State.

128
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:59,811
What brought you guys back?

129
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,771
Jesus, once I escape,
I am never coming back.

130
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:06,209
Do you remember the last time
you were here?

131
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,732
It was a long time ago.

132
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,738
Nothing much has changed, so...

133
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,915
- Yeah.
- Won't be different.

134
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,702
So, what do you do around here?

135
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,399
Gosh.

136
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,314
Um, we go to the lake.

137
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,968
We...

138
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,317
you know.

139
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,971
Yeah.

140
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,886
Go to the movies. That's fun.

141
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,889
There's a couple cute boys
at school.

142
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,717
This is it.

143
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:41,592
Your room's a little crazy,
friend.

144
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,855
What is all this stuff?

145
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,553
Oh, this is my gear.

146
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,294
The Mormons might
be kind of weird,

147
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,513
but they're onto something.

148
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,776
Onto what?

149
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,822
Angels and demons
walking the earth.

150
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,476
I know, it sounds crazy,

151
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,130
but I've been reading
a lot about it,

152
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,175
and it all sounds so epic.

153
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:02,004
Just want to make sure I'm ready
in case anything ever happens.

154
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:05,138
- Serious? Angels and demons?
- Yes, seriously.

155
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,140
Demons are serious stuff.

156
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,838
Haven't you ever seen
"The Exorcist"?

157
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:12,667
Once Regan used that Ouija board
to invite Captain Howdy in,

158
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,060
she was fucked.

159
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,410
I've never seen it.

160
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,542
You never seen "The Exorcist"?

161
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,936
We have to watch it one night.

162
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,377
Do you remember Shane Stevens?

163
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,205
He was the nerdy kid
with the turtle.

164
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,338
He'd follow us around the gym.
Had a crush on you.

165
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,166
Kinda.

166
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,777
He's hot and single, and we're
hanging out tonight.

167
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,431
Do you want to come?

168
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,389
I don't know, Hannah.

169
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,739
You're invited.
You're coming.

170
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,095
Oh, there you are.
I thought you were upstairs.

171
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:36,142
Hi, I'm Hannah.
You must be Aunt Tanya.

172
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,579
Yeah. Miss Winbourne,
or Aunt Tanya.

173
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:40,015
"Tanya" is good.

174
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,235
Cool.

175
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,063
What are you guys up to? I was just going to
make dinner. Do you wanna stay for dinner?

176
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,500
Oh, no. Hannah are I were going
to go to the dock

177
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,067
and hang out
with a bunch of friends.

178
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,764
Oh, you were going to go?

179
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,592
Do you mind if we go?

180
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,855
Just don't be late.
You have school tomorrow.

181
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,683
Yeah, we won't.
We won't be.

182
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:59,121
Okay. Do you know what happened
with that picture?

183
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,123
Yeah, I found a school picture
of Mom,

184
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,994
and I thought
I'd put it up there.

185
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,213
Is that all right?

186
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,823
Yeah, it's fine.

187
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,390
Whatever you need
to feel at home.

188
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,175
I'm gonna run upstairs
and get changed.

189
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,002
- Okay.
- It was nice to meet you,

190
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:15,964
Aunt Tanya, or Tanya,
or Miss Winbourne.

191
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,500
Ooh!

192
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,590
Ooh, you're so creepy.

193
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,736
- Carrie!
- Hannah's here.

194
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,781
What is up?

195
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:54,045
- The life of the party is here.
- Finally. Took you long enough.

196
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,525
How are you?

197
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,440
Great. Good to see you.

198
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:59,616
I thought I'd spend
more time with my girl.

199
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,575
Your girl?

200
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,707
You know what I'm saying.

201
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,539
So, everyone, this is our
long-lost friend, Ashley,

202
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,846
You may know her as
the little girl from art class.

203
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,979
But as you can see, she's fully
grown to start some trouble.

204
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:17,939
- Whoo!
- So, friends, Ashley.

205
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,897
- Ashley, friends.
- Nice to meet you, Ashley.

206
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,943
Hey, I'm Bryce.
Call me Big Bryce. Big Bryce.

207
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,641
Hey.

208
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,382
How are you?

209
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,951
Get you something to drink.

210
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,214
- It's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you too.

211
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,563
It's been a while.

212
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,086
Yeah.

213
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,915
Well, make yourself
at home and...

214
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,352
let's party.

215
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,877
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm good.

216
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,748
Oh, yeah, I don't drink either.
It's cool.

217
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,794
- All right.
- Let's go.

218
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,191
Do you remember me?

219
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,062
Yeah.

220
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,978
You used to follow us
around gym.

221
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,022
Oh, man.

222
00:19:58,632 --> 00:19:59,981
How's your pet turtle?

223
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:01,025
Myrtle?

224
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,768
She wasn't long for this world,
I guess.

225
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,335
She, uh...

226
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:07,641
she's in a better place.

227
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,822
It's good to have you back.

228
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,345
Thanks.

229
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,617
Hey, I know something fun.

230
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,663
Do you guys have that new
EVP app?

231
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,404
What, the stupid
"Ghost Hunters" shit?

232
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,058
- You're such a dork.
- Yeah, a cute dork.

233
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,277
What's EVP?

234
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:36,974
Oh, my God. Check it out.

235
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,760
EVP is "electronic
voice phenomenon."

236
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:42,241
It's the app they use in all
those ghost-hunting shows.

237
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,895
- It totally works.
- I got it on my phone here.

238
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,767
Of course you do.

239
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,204
Dude, he's so whipped.

240
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,598
Everyone, listen, the phone's
going to pick up anything

241
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:54,731
from the spirit world: voices,
paranormal activity, anything.

242
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,124
Listen.

243
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,389
Are there any spirits out there
that want to talk to us?

244
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,915
I don't know, Hannah.
This is kind of weird.

245
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,569
Come on,
don't worry about it.

246
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,179
I'm sure this stuff
doesn't even work.

247
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,398
You guys hear that?

248
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:11,487
Oh, my God.

249
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,316
I think it's saying for the
girls to show us their boobs.

250
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,318
I'm sure that's what you heard,
perv.

251
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:19,408
No, but really, listen.

252
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:21,541
Ashley.

253
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,551
Ashley.

254
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,697
What the hell
is wrong with this girl?

255
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,873
Are you okay? What's wrong?

256
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:53,442
I don't know.
I think I saw my mom.

257
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,401
You're such a dick, Bryce.

258
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,446
- Ashley, wait up.
- Dude, what's your problem?

259
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,144
She's screaming, we're trying
to have a good, quiet evening.

260
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:02,277
I'm leaving.
Are you coming?

261
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,453
I drove you here,
so you better come.

262
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,385
Ashley.

263
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,866
Aunt Tanya.

264
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,843
Ashley, you okay?

265
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,758
Yeah, I'm fine,
Aunt Tanya.

266
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,151
I'm taking a bath.

267
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,631
Okay.

268
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,707
Come in.

269
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:56,625
Hey. How was your thing
with your friends?

270
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,105
It was okay.

271
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:02,065
You look so much
like your mom.

272
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,895
That's her necklace, isn't it?

273
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,941
Yeah.

274
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:10,857
I've worn it since
I was a little kid.

275
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,294
It's like a little
piece of her.

276
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:18,299
You know, I bought that for her
on her 16th birthday.

277
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,740
I hope you know how happy I am
to have you here, Ashley.

278
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,047
I do.

279
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,179
I just wish
Jordan was here.

280
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,529
I know.

281
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,444
It's going to be okay.

282
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:35,316
You know that, right?

283
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:39,059
How do you know?

284
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:41,191
Because I know.

285
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:44,543
And I know that God never gives
us more than we can handle.

286
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,157
I just feel like
he's given me a lot,

287
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,073
and I'm really trying
to handle it all.

288
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:55,031
I know you are.

289
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,295
But you are so strong.

290
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:01,255
You're going
to get through this.

291
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:04,954
And if there's anything I can do
to make you feel more at home,

292
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,739
please let me know.

293
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,828
Thank you.

294
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,353
Ready for your first
day of school tomorrow?

295
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:15,835
Ready or not,
here it comes.

296
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,316
All right, you get some sleep,
sweetie, okay?

297
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,753
I'll see you in the morning.

298
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:22,842
- Good night.
- Good night.

299
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:45,680
You boys don't be late to school,
now, or we'll all be in trouble.

300
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,203
Okay?

301
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,683
Thanks, Sam.

302
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,828
Good morning.

303
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:04,612
Hi, good morning.

304
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:13,316
Pastor John,
what's the word?

305
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,058
Oh, hey, Sam. Same as always.
God's word.

306
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,371
Ashley?

307
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,809
Yeah?

308
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,332
Hi. I'm...

309
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,812
I'm John.

310
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:34,381
I'm the new pastor
at Celebration.

311
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:37,384
I work a lot
with the youth ministry,

312
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:39,821
and your Aunt Tanya
told me a lot about you.

313
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,475
Okay.

314
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,261
Well, how are you doing?

315
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,002
I mean, are you happy
to be back?

316
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,832
Yeah. It's all right.

317
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:53,269
Well, what's left of it.

318
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:55,054
Yeah.

319
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:57,360
I know the feeling.

320
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,886
Well, I like this part of town.

321
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,583
I feel like it's got
a lot of personality.

322
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,283
I kind of feel like
it's the last link to the past.

323
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:13,986
You know, we got a lot of really
great events planned at church.

324
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:17,119
It'd be really nice
to see you there sometime.

325
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:20,427
Yeah, it'd be cool.

326
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:24,692
Is that the 7D?

327
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:26,825
Yeah, it sure is.

328
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:29,349
That's right, Tanya told me
that you're into photography.

329
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,003
Yeah, I love it.
I have the Mark V,

330
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,483
but I heard the VII
takes better pictures.

331
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,181
Yeah, the picture quality
is great.

332
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:38,532
It just... sometimes
the exposure's off.

333
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,621
Maybe you could
take a look at it?

334
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:42,666
Yeah.

335
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,930
You know, I'm always looking
for talented photographers

336
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,845
to take pictures
at church events.

337
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:49,282
I'd love to. Can I get back
to you about that?

338
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:51,632
- Okay, great.
- Pastor John. Hey.

339
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:53,764
- Hey. I'll see you Sunday.
All right.

340
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:56,811
Hannah, haven't seen you
at church in a while.

341
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:00,467
I see you smiling.

342
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,947
What, you think he's hot?

343
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:04,906
No, but he's pretty cool.

344
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,734
Yeah, okay, you know
for a pastor.

345
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:08,040
Whatever.

346
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,130
Hey, are you okay?

347
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,827
Freaked out yesterday.

348
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,612
Yeah, it was nothing.

349
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:17,136
It was something.

350
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:18,746
Did you see something?

351
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,748
What were you saying
about your mom?

352
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:25,144
I don't know.
My mind's playing tricks on me.

353
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,059
Are you sure?
Because it just seemed...

354
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,974
Hannah, it was nothing.

355
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,933
Whatever you say, Ash.
But it was definitely something.

356
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,371
You girls playing
the next EVP session?

357
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,199
- I want in.
- Come on, man, knock it off.

358
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,940
You guys want a ride to school?

359
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:41,247
Really? This is our workout
for the day.

360
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,989
And besides, the school's
right up the street, dumbasses.

361
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,512
All right, fine,
but you're missing out

362
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,166
on the pleasure of our company.

363
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,864
See you later, ladies.

364
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:53,563
See you at school, sweetie!

365
00:31:58,786 --> 00:31:59,787
Wait, hold on.

366
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:06,489
Hannah, what is this?

367
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,448
It's Shane.

368
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,189
I gave him your number.

369
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:11,799
Wait, Hannah...

370
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,368
What are you doing?

371
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:17,022
I don't know.
What do you think?

372
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,588
You take a look.

373
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,634
One second, excuse me.

374
00:32:20,677 --> 00:32:22,418
Hello?

375
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:23,942
Speaking.

376
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:40,306
- Hey.
- Hey, have you seen Ashley?

377
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,786
I've been texting her all day
and she's not responding.

378
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,484
I was actually about to ask you.

379
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,007
I was going to see
if she needed a ride.

380
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:47,269
Did you hear what happened?

381
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,792
Yeah, is she okay?

382
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:51,012
There she is.

383
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:54,842
Hey, Ashley,
what happened to you?

384
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,539
- Nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.

385
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,585
You almost gave Mr. Diggler
a heart attack.

386
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,891
I just want to go home.

387
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,719
All right, just stay here.

388
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,983
I'll go get my truck
and I can take you home, okay?

389
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:07,942
Did you see
your mom again?

390
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,684
Um... I don't know.

391
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:11,946
Holy shit, you did.

392
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,817
Hannah, please stop, okay?

393
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,994
No, Ashley, there's something
going on with you.

394
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,734
I'm coming over tonight.

395
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,649
I just... I need sleep,
that's it.

396
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:21,173
I'll see you tonight.

397
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:33,750
Not the best
first day of school, huh?

398
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:41,193
I just want to say that
I'm sorry about this morning.

399
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,933
We were just messing
with you guys.

400
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,690
This is Ashley. Leave a message.

401
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:05,260
Hey, Ash, I'm just calling
to check on you.

402
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,828
I just got off the phone
with your principal.

403
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:10,135
So call me when you can, okay?

404
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,460
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah, no problem.

405
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:36,074
So I guess I'll see you
tomorrow?

406
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,815
Yeah.

407
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,556
Could I give you
another ride tomorrow?

408
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,125
Sure.

409
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,527
Hey.

410
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:41,617
No, no. I'm just glad
you're okay.

411
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,143
Okay, we'll talk
when I get home, okay?

412
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,057
All right,
I'll be home soon.

413
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,711
Okay.

414
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,038
Hello?

415
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,154
Hello?

416
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:47,335
This isn't funny.

417
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:23,213
Hey!

418
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:26,869
Hannah, you can't...
shit, scare me like that.

419
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:29,394
- Sorry. I'll knock next time.
- Oh, my gosh.

420
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:32,440
You were just, like,
knocking all over the house.

421
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:34,442
What are you talking about?

422
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:37,576
Very funny.

423
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,882
It wasn't me, but okay.

424
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,146
What's that smell?

425
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,061
I don't know.

426
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:47,150
Something must have died
in the vent or something.

427
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:51,372
Hey, is that a Bible?
We're going to need it.

428
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,035
So, what are we doing?

429
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,080
This is my first time
trying this.

430
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,692
Do you remember that EVP thing
that I showed you last night?

431
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,563
Well, this is way better
for communicating

432
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:10,435
with one specific
dead person.

433
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:13,612
- It's totally old-school.
- I don't know, Hannah.

434
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:16,528
Trust me. We have to figure
out if this is actually your mom

435
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,181
trying to reach out to you.

436
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,488
- What if it's...
- What if what?

437
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,621
What if it works?

438
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:28,278
What's your mom's first name?
It's super important.

439
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,107
Sarah.

440
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:34,067
Okay. If Sarah reveals
herself to you,

441
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,722
you have to acknowledge her
and ask her to come back to you.

442
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:39,289
That way, we can figure out
what's keeping her here.

443
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,553
Okay.

444
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:44,164
Okay. Let's begin.

445
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:48,821
Hello, Sarah.

446
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:51,171
I'm Hannah, and I'm here
with your daughter, Ashley.

447
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,303
She'd like to speak with you.

448
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,524
Will you communicate
with us?

449
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:04,880
Sarah, if you're here,
give us a sign.

450
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:06,534
Hannah, what's with
this mirror?

451
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,536
Should we close our eyes
or something?

452
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,278
No, I think the mirrors acts as
a conduit to the spirit world.

453
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:14,107
We have to look directly into it
in order to see your mom.

454
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,067
Sarah, please speak now.

455
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:24,422
Sarah, please come forward
and speak with your daughter.

456
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,600
What the hell?
Did you hear that?

457
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,472
- Yeah. What was that?
- I don't know.

458
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,256
Sarah, show us
that you're here.

459
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,913
What the hell? I saw something.
What did you see?

460
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,437
I don't... I don't know.

461
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,743
Call her, Ashley.
She's here.

462
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,484
- Mom.
- Ask her again.

463
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,399
Mom, are you here?

464
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,532
Please, Mom, I'm begging you,
I want you in my life.

465
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:50,665
Will you please come back to me?
I love you. Please!

466
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,670
What did you do?

467
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:58,020
I did what you told me to do.

468
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:01,763
This doesn't feel right.

469
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:03,548
What do you mean?

470
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:17,475
Hey, it's freezing in here.

471
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:20,782
What are you guys doing?

472
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:22,349
What is that smell?

473
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:24,003
I should probably get going.

474
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:26,484
- Bye, Miss Winbourne.
- Hannah, wait.

475
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,924
Hannah, wait.

476
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,449
We're messed up.

477
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,539
That shadow was dark.
I'm not sure it was your mom.

478
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,715
- I just...
- What do you mean?

479
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:42,238
I don't know.

480
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:44,327
I'll see you.

481
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:55,904
Well, she left in a hurry.

482
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:58,777
- What's going on?
- Nothing. It was nothing.

483
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,431
Next you'll tell me what
happened in school is nothing?

484
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:03,477
I don't want to talk about it.

485
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,436
- Okay, Ashley...
- I don't want to talk about it!

486
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,358
Listen, Ashley, you may not
want to talk to me

487
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,056
about every single thing
you're doing,

488
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,537
but you will not
disrespect me.

489
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,627
I'm sorry, Aunt Tanya.

490
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,065
I didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

491
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:30,330
Look, this isn't easy
for me either.

492
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,336
I'm sorry, okay?
Today was really hard.

493
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:39,600
Is there anything
I can do to help?

494
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,690
I don't think so.

495
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,736
How about we have
a movie night?

496
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:48,348
We can watch something light,
we can pig out on popcorn.

497
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:51,569
It was your mom and my favorite
thing to do.

498
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:54,876
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,981
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

500
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:20,946
So, tell me more about
you and mom's movie nights.

501
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:23,818
Oh, they were our favorite
things to do.

502
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,344
Mostly, it was just an excuse
to stay up late

503
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:31,652
and talk about boys
and school.

504
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:32,871
And boys.

505
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,309
We talked about
everything.

506
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:40,922
Did she ever talk
about wanting to be a mom?

507
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:43,055
Or having kids?

508
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:06,469
I've preparest
a table before me

509
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,776
in the presence
of mine enemies.

510
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,257
Thou anoints...

511
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,652
I... I have failed.

512
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,177
I have failed you.

513
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,744
I have failed thee.

514
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,965
I need to tell you something.

515
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:26,533
Okay.

516
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:28,840
I'm pregnant.

517
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,931
Tanya, listen.

518
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,065
There's something
going on with me.

519
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,722
I'm hearing these voices
in my head.

520
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,464
And it's... it's making me
do things.

521
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:46,640
Really bad things.

522
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:49,948
And I can't control it.

523
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:52,951
I don't know what you mean,
that you can't control it.

524
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:55,170
- I need your help.
- I don't...

525
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:56,650
Tanya...

526
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:58,870
You need to see someone.

527
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,741
You need medical help.

528
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:02,525
- Sarah...
- I'm scared.

529
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,443
Please, Tanya,
just pray with me, okay?

530
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:09,097
Okay, okay, okay.

531
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:11,839
Dear heavenly Father,

532
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:13,623
please watch over Sarah.

533
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,625
Please cast out
her afflictions

534
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:19,238
and heal her mind
and her thoughts and action.

535
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:21,936
Please watch over my sister.

536
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:27,725
What is it?

537
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:30,684
What are you saying, Sarah.

538
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,991
- You don't believe me.
- I do.

539
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:35,210
I don't know what to do.

540
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:37,212
You don't believe me.

541
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:39,214
Aunt Tanya?

542
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:40,781
Ashley.

543
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,609
Oh, God, I'm...

544
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:45,351
- Are you okay?
- I must have had a nightmare.

545
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:48,658
I'm sorry I fell
asleep on you.

546
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:50,443
No, it's okay.

547
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,227
Um...

548
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:54,577
You know, I'm going
to go to bed.

549
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:56,797
I don't think you'll like
the movie anyways.

550
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:58,668
It doesn't have
a happy ending.

551
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:00,714
No, you know what?
I'm...

552
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,499
I'm going to head to bed too.
It's way past my bedtime.

553
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:05,545
You sleep good, angel.

554
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:06,894
Thanks.

555
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:37,245
I see you got
your appetite back.

556
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:39,900
How'd you sleep?

557
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:50,345
Ashley, what happened
to your shoulder?

558
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:52,434
Oh, I just bumped into some
branches in the woods.

559
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:54,741
It doesn't look like
you just bumped into branches.

560
00:47:54,784 --> 00:47:56,612
- Let me see.
- I got to go, I'm late.

561
00:47:56,656 --> 00:47:58,005
Bye.

562
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:20,549
Hey.

563
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:22,029
Hi.

564
00:48:22,073 --> 00:48:23,683
Ready to go?

565
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:25,467
Yeah.

566
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:28,688
I was thinking after
what happened yesterday,

567
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,777
we could use a little
adventure.

568
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,257
What do you say?

569
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:35,608
I say, get in.

570
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:36,914
All right.

571
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:43,224
Wait, where are you going?

572
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:45,139
Hop in.

573
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:39,628
They say that if you close
your eyes,

574
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:42,936
you can feel that my hands
are going to move a lot faster.

575
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,677
You want me
to close my eyes?

576
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,332
Yeah, close your eyes.
Trust me.

577
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,725
You ready?

578
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,251
Oh, come on.

579
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,514
- I'm going easy on you.
- Oh, really?

580
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:57,124
- Yeah.
- Close your eyes.

581
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,562
All right.

582
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:06,003
- Last one.
- Okay.

583
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,830
- Actually try this time.
- All right.

584
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,357
Ow.

585
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,141
Jeez.

586
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:16,404
So, what's it like
being back?

587
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:19,190
I don't know.
Do you like my outfit?

588
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,888
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

589
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:24,108
Then come closer.

590
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:26,501
Okay.

591
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,683
Do I scare you?

592
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:37,382
- Do you scare me?
- Yeah.

593
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:39,340
No, you don't scare me.

594
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:41,908
Then kiss me.

595
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,268
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
come on.

596
00:50:54,312 --> 00:50:56,401
Slow down a bit.
We don't have to go that fast.

597
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:58,229
Oh, come on,
isn't this what you want?

598
00:50:58,272 --> 00:50:59,665
I guess.

599
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,539
Hold on. Ashley,
I just want to see something.

600
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,237
Stop for a second.

601
00:51:10,415 --> 00:51:11,851
What the fu...

602
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:13,592
You bit my tongue.

603
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:15,855
Oh, come on, Shane.

604
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:23,167
What the heck
is wrong with you?

605
00:51:26,387 --> 00:51:29,086
Sorry, excuse me a second.

606
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:32,959
Hello?

607
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:34,569
I'm sorry, what?

608
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,791
No, she left this morning
for school.

609
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:42,273
Are you sure?

610
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:44,710
Okay, thank you.

611
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:52,805
This is Ashley. Leave a message.

612
00:51:52,848 --> 00:51:55,503
Where are you?
Call me now.

613
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:58,289
- Is everything okay?
- No. I got to go.

614
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:12,390
This is Ashley. Leave a message.

615
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:15,088
Hey, Ash,
where were you today?

616
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,524
Call me.

617
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:21,834
Ashley?

618
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:26,491
Ashley?

619
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,153
Ashley?

620
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:45,162
Ashley?

621
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:01,874
"Inviting spirits into our world

622
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:04,224
"can lead to the unintended
and lethal consequence

623
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:05,747
of demonic possession."

624
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:18,891
This is Ashley. Leave a message.

625
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:21,720
Ashley, can you call me?

626
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:24,026
I have to tell you something.

627
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:31,991
Ashley?

628
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:36,909
Ashley, we need to talk.

629
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,828
Ashley, I am talking to you.

630
00:53:44,438 --> 00:53:47,093
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. What happened?

631
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:50,357
Okay, put your head back.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

632
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:52,446
It's all right.

633
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:09,246
What are you doing here
so late?

634
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:10,856
Oh.

635
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:12,771
I just wanted to come
and make sure

636
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:15,208
everything was good
for tomorrow's small group.

637
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,644
What about you?

638
00:54:16,688 --> 00:54:17,863
What are you doing here
so late?

639
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:20,953
Pray.

640
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,174
Hmm.

641
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:27,089
Come on, Reverend.
I'll give you a ride home.

642
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:29,353
I can come in early tomorrow.
We can talk in the car.

643
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:32,356
Well, thank you
for your generosity,

644
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:37,056
but I don't need a therapist
or a chauffeur at the moment.

645
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:39,014
What do you need?

646
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:40,494
Uh...

647
00:54:40,538 --> 00:54:41,887
forgiveness.

648
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,196
Don't we all?

649
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,466
Well, you came
to the right place.

650
00:54:57,076 --> 00:54:59,426
What's on your heart?

651
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:04,257
You ever doubt, John?

652
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:07,173
Of course.

653
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:09,349
Doubt is part of humanity.

654
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:11,743
I doubt and I question,

655
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:14,354
but in the end my faith
is strengthened in... what?

656
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,922
Spare me the seminary
bullshit.

657
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:18,967
I mean, really doubt.

658
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:24,495
Not just in him,
but in yourself.

659
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:28,368
Your goodness.

660
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:33,895
Your ability to fight
for goodness in others.

661
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:36,811
Hmm.

662
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:42,121
I believe there's a name
for that.

663
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:43,949
- A wavering assurance.
- Oh, that's right.

664
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:46,386
We're always quick
with the names, aren't we?

665
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,780
To name is to destroy.

666
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,133
There was a time when I was
pretty good at that:

667
00:55:54,176 --> 00:55:55,613
naming.

668
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:59,834
Goodness and God, love.

669
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,012
Wish I could name it now.

670
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,580
Hmm.

671
00:56:07,886 --> 00:56:09,844
I'm afraid I don't follow.

672
00:56:11,846 --> 00:56:13,761
Well, you won't, Reverend.

673
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:16,851
To destroy your
wavering assurance?

674
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,419
To find peace
in your own goodness?

675
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,290
What do I want?

676
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:23,031
What do I want more
than anything?

677
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:26,774
More than finding peace
in my own goodness?

678
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:31,300
I want to destroy
the darkness.

679
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:35,783
I want to make it right
for all those souls

680
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:37,829
that I have failed.

681
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:44,183
Then that is what
I will help you do.

682
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:48,448
And into the presence
of the Lord, there is no doubt.

683
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,276
Yes.

684
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,105
In the presence of the Lord,
there is no doubt.

685
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,457
That was more blood

686
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,939
than I have seen come out of
anybody nose in my whole life.

687
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:03,158
Two pints.

688
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:04,508
Tanya.

689
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:08,599
- How is she?
- She's fine.

690
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:10,470
It's just a nosebleed.

691
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,516
Just a nosebleed?
There was blood everywhere.

692
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,648
Look, nosebleeds often look
much worse than they are.

693
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:17,303
It's the stress of the
environment could be the cause.

694
00:57:17,346 --> 00:57:19,697
Change affects each of us
very differently.

695
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,351
No, I'm... I'm really
worried about her.

696
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:24,049
You don't need
to worry, Tanya.

697
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:25,833
No, you weren't there.
You didn't see her.

698
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:27,356
Paging Dr. Carraz.

699
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,793
I got to run.
But, you know,

700
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,838
I left her in the care
of an on-call psychiatrist,

701
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,623
Dr. Liles.
You can go see her.

702
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:34,363
She's in good hands.

703
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:35,756
It'll do her good
to talk to someone.

704
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,105
Okay?

705
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:41,370
Hi, Tanya, I'm Dr. Liles.

706
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:43,111
Thanks for coming in.

707
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:44,809
There are just a few things

708
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:47,202
I needed to go over
with both of you.

709
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:50,597
I'm going to prescribe
an anti-depressant

710
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:53,600
I want you to take
for a few weeks.

711
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:57,778
It'll help make the transitional
period a little easier.

712
00:57:57,822 --> 00:58:01,695
I'm also going to prescribe
a sedative

713
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,654
to help you sleep.

714
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:05,917
Do you really think
she needs all that?

715
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,962
I do.

716
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:11,662
Her mind and body need sleep
in order to heal themselves.

717
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:13,446
And the medicine
will make her calm

718
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,969
and enable that to happen.

719
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:16,971
Okay?

720
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:19,626
But if you have any questions,
please feel free to call me.

721
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,759
I will. Thank you.

722
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:24,979
You're okay, kiddo.

723
00:58:25,023 --> 00:58:28,330
But if you need anyone
to talk to,

724
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:30,289
call me anytime.

725
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:20,921
screams]

726
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:30,338
Tanya.

727
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:38,129
Tanya...

728

- Good morning.

737
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:34,898
Thank you for being here on
this beautiful Sunday morning.

738
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:36,638
Please be seated.

739
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:39,206
Now, this is the will of him
who sent me,

740
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,165
the Father,

741
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,559
that I should lose nothing
of what he has given me,

742
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:47,911
but that I should raise it up
on the last day,

743
01:03:47,954 --> 01:03:51,740
for this is the will
of my father who sent me.

744
01:03:51,784 --> 01:03:55,919
That whoever holds the son
and believes in him

745
01:03:55,962 --> 01:03:57,964
shall have everlasting life.

746
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:00,967
And I will raise him up
on the last day.

747
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:05,189
They said therefore to him,

748
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:08,148
"Lord, give us always
this bread."

749
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:10,759
But Jesus said to them,

750
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:12,065
"I am the bread of life."

751
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:15,286
"He who comes to me
shall not hunger."

752
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:19,943
"He who believes in me
shall never thirst.

753
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:24,512
"But I have told you
that I have seen thee,

754
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,166
and you do not believe."

755
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:40,615
I thirst Apostles' Creed.

756
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:42,966
I'll feast on her soul.

757
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:59,939
Look, I got to run
to the hospital.

758
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:02,159
I'm going to come check on you
as soon as possible.

759
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:04,639
I beg you, leave her with me.
I can help her.

760
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:07,381
I am not leaving her side.
The only reason I brought her

761
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:09,296
was because I didn't know
what else to do.

762
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,168
Her soul is in jeopardy.

763
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:13,866
She needs to be on holy ground
for her own survival.

764
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,650
It's happening again,

765
01:05:15,694 --> 01:05:18,349
what happened with Sarah.

766
01:05:18,392 --> 01:05:21,004
Don't you dare
say her name.

767
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:22,875
What did you do to her?

768
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,529
I knew something
was wrong with her,

769
01:05:24,572 --> 01:05:26,096
and I left anyway.

770
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:27,619
Well, that is not
happening again.

771
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:32,102
Tanya...

772
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:35,975
I'll figure it out on my own.

773
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:42,808
Come to my office, now.

774
01:05:45,898 --> 01:05:47,726
So, what's going on
with Ashley?

775
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:50,729
I need to know exactly
what we're up against.

776
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:58,345
I've seen more evil
than any one man should.

777
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:02,480
And demonic possession
is real.

778
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:05,396
I've had too many people

779
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,833
that I have loved and led
consumed by evil,

780
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:11,532
and I have fought
tooth and nail,

781
01:06:11,576 --> 01:06:13,447
and I have lost.

782
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:16,624
I have lost more than you can
begin to imagine.

783
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:20,933
It is shaken my faith and
my belief in myself to the core.

784
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:25,851
I don't know what to say.

785
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:27,200
I want to help any way I can.

786
01:06:30,595 --> 01:06:32,684
The greatest weapon we have
against the demon

787
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:34,816
lies within his name.

788
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,862
Well, the demon is commanded
to give his name

789
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:39,212
in the name of Jesus Christ,
shouldn't it?

790
01:06:39,256 --> 01:06:41,519
Not always. I believe this one
has been invited in,

791
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:43,347
like Ashley's mother's case.

792
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,610
He won't give up his name
so easily.

793
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:47,612
Ashley's mother?

794
01:06:47,655 --> 01:06:49,657
Yes.

795
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:51,703
Well, then we have
to figure out a way.

796
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:55,054
We have to help
any way that we can.

797
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:58,536
Yes. Grab as many books
as you can on possession

798
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:00,538
and name demonic entities.

799
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:02,148
I'm going to give you
a crash course

800
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:05,630
in performing an exorcism.

801
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:08,546
We have to go to Tanya's
and fight for Ashley.

802
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:11,723
We can't have evil win.

803
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:13,464
Not again.

804
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:18,208
Possession has three
demonic stages.

805
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:20,862
The first is infestation.

806
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:24,431
A demon will be active
in a place, or space.

807
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:27,739
Some of these signs
may be objects moving,

808
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:32,396
unrecognizable whispering
and putrid smells.

809
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:35,094
The second is oppression.

810
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:36,661
This is when the demon
is focused

811
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:40,752
on one specific person
or individual.

812
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:44,669
The demon will take the form
of a loved one to earn trust.

813
01:07:44,712 --> 01:07:46,845
The final stage
is possession.

814
01:07:46,888 --> 01:07:49,152
This is when the person
invites a demon in,

815
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:52,546
allowing the demon
to take complete control.

816
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:55,114
The only way to defeat
the demon

817
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:56,942
is to unlock
the secret of his name

818
01:07:56,985 --> 01:07:59,031
and use it against him.

819
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:12,871
How is she?

820
01:08:12,914 --> 01:08:14,481
She's not good.

821
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:17,180
- Where is she?
- She's upstairs, resting.

822
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:20,139
There was an accident
involving Hannah.

823
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,794
Is she okay?

824
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:31,455
I'm going to go
see Ashley.

825
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:15,281
Tanya.

826
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:18,763
This is more than you can handle
on your own.

827
01:09:18,806 --> 01:09:20,504
It's beyond your control.

828
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,247
It's gotten worse,
hasn't it?

829
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:29,600
I don't know what to do.

830
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:32,211
Tell me what to do.

831
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,319
Oh, dear Lord.

832
01:09:57,715 --> 01:09:59,499
Redo that restraint.

833
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,942
Our Father, who art in heaven,

834
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:09,770
hallowed be thy name.

835
01:10:09,814 --> 01:10:11,642
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on Earth,

836
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:13,992
as it is in heaven.

837
01:10:14,035 --> 01:10:16,777
And what of my will?

838
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:21,347
Lord, Jesus Christ,
is upon you.

839
01:10:25,395 --> 01:10:27,919
Lord, protect Ashley.

840
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:29,747
And keep her safe.

841
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,751
Ashley's not here.

842
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:36,928
Is this your handiwork?

843
01:10:36,971 --> 01:10:39,322
Ah, ah, ah, Michael.

844
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:43,108
Who are you?

845
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:44,588
Who are you?

846
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:46,503
Who the fuck are you?

847
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:48,331
Dear Lord...

848
01:10:48,374 --> 01:10:50,898
I'm John Douglas,
the pastor of Celebration.

849
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:53,379
"I'm John Douglas,
pastor of Celebration."

850
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:55,686
Cocksucker!

851
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:59,255
Dear Lord, cast away any evil

852
01:10:59,298 --> 01:11:02,475
that harms this child, Ashley,
or Tanya.

853
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:05,043
Her soul is mine.

854
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:09,177
Oh, my God!

855
01:11:09,221 --> 01:11:11,919
"Oh, my God!"

856
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:17,229
Why hast thou forsaken me?

857
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:20,232
You don't believe me.

858
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,801
Help me, Tanya!

859
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:27,326
Get her out of here.
Get her out of here!

860
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:31,852
We need to be alone with the demon.

861
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:39,338
The only chance we have
of learning the demon's name

862
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:43,908
is to get her back to holy
ground after she's sedated.

863
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:50,044
I need you to hold her

864
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:52,395
while I inject her.

865
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:28,822
We will prevail with the power of the Lord.

866
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:31,042
And if we do not?

867
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:35,699
We will vanquish
wavering assurances

868
01:12:35,742 --> 01:12:38,702
in the presence of the Lord,
there is no doubt.

869
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:04,641
Demon, in the name
of Jesus Christ,

870
01:13:04,684 --> 01:13:07,295
I rebuke you
and cast you away.

871
01:13:07,339 --> 01:13:09,167
Fuck...

872
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:14,172
you.

873
01:13:14,215 --> 01:13:15,434
Ah!

874
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:18,306
Don't throw my piss on me.

875
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:23,660
God, the Father Almighty,

876
01:13:23,703 --> 01:13:25,357
maker of heaven and earth,
and to Jesus Christ,

877
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,967
his only son, our Lord,

878
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:28,708
who was conceived
of the Holy Ghost,

879
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:30,275
born of the Virgin Mary,

880
01:13:30,318 --> 01:13:32,408
suffered unto Pontius Pilate,

881
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:34,192
was crucified,
dead and buried.

882
01:13:34,235 --> 01:13:35,976
He descended into hell.

883
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,630
The third day,
he arose from the dead

884
01:13:37,674 --> 01:13:39,197
and ascended into heaven,

885
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,938
and siteth upon
the right hand of God!

886
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:42,635
The power almighty.

887
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:46,160
He shall come to judge
the quick and the dead.

888
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:53,254
Demon, you have
no place here.

889
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:54,865
I cast you!

890
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:07,965
I submit to the will of God.

891
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:15,494
I am God.

892
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:17,453
You are a demon
and a coward!

893
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:19,933
And you hide in a child.

894
01:14:19,977 --> 01:14:21,457
You are a coward.

895
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,633
In the name
of Jesus Christ,

896
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:26,287
I command you tell me
your name.

897
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:30,204
You are mistaken.

898
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,946
She has invited me in.

899
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:39,344
No! No!

900
01:14:39,387 --> 01:14:41,389
Get her away from him!

901
01:14:43,653 --> 01:14:47,526
John? John!
Get the book. Get the book.

902
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,710
In the name of Jesus Christ,
tell me your name.

903
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:01,061
Thy kingdom...

904
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:02,541
I rebuke you, Satan,

905
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:04,238
and all your dark angels,

906
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:06,502
in the name of Jesus Christ.

907
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:07,807
Tell me your name!

908
01:16:02,949 --> 01:16:05,561
I am the Lord.

909
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:11,305
I will not fail to punish
your children and grandchildren

910
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:14,221
for the sins
of their parents.

911
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:17,050
I rebuke you, Satan,

912
01:16:17,094 --> 01:16:20,358
and all your dark angels,
in the name of Jesus Christ.

913
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:22,273
Tell me your name!

914
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:54,697
Ashley?

915
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:57,090
Ashley.

916
01:17:00,528 --> 01:17:02,400
Ashley, where are you?

917
01:17:03,488 --> 01:17:04,968
Ashley.

918
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:08,014
Ashley?

919
01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:25,510
Tanya, please help me.

920
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:30,341
I just want to go home.

921
01:17:30,384 --> 01:17:32,822
Okay. Come, come...

922
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,914
It's okay. It's okay.

923
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:50,535
Get her back
to the church.

924
01:19:01,258 --> 01:19:03,086
Jordan.

925
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:05,741
Jordan, you need
to come home.

926
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,189
Tanya, you shouldn't be here.

927
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:23,889
I am not going anywhere.

928
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,502
Then I have something
to show you.

929
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:53,223
May God bring you peace, Kyle.

930
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,543
May God bring you peace, Ashley.

931
01:20:48,104 --> 01:20:50,149
May God bring you peace, Sarah.
