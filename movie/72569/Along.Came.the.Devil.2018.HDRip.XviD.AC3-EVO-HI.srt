00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,365
Do you know how much
I love you?

4
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,280
No.

5
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:51,589
More than all the sand
on all the beaches

00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,200
in all the world.

7
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,813
Describe her to me again.

8
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,685
What was she like?

9
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,776
She had long hair,
a beautiful smile.

10
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,953
She wore a pretty blue dress
that shined in the sun.

11
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,173
What about this?

12
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:13,698
She loved it
and wore it every day.

13
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,352
Just like you.

14
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:17,963
Was she pretty?

15
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,531
Very pretty.
The prettiest.

16
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,272
Did she love us?

17
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:23,839
Always.

18
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:27,538
I am not going
to tell you both again.

19
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,192
All right?

20
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,585
I put you in here,

21
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,413
and I want no talking.

22
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,893
And I don't want you
to think about leaving

23
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,286
this fucking closet.

24
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,636
Do I make myself
crystal clear?

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,508
Yes, Daddy.

26
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,381
And don't make me come back
one more time,

27
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,818
because if I do, I swear to God
I'll grab that necklace

28
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,820
from around your fucking neck
so fast.

29
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:54,086

Come on.

33
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,145
Now I lay me down to sleep.

34
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,930
[both]
Pray the Lord my soul to keep.

35
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,106
If I should die before I wake,

36
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,326
pray the Lord
my soul to take.

37
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,242
God bless Mommy,
God bless Daddy,

38

Kids?

55
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,959
You had kids in here?

You son of a bitch.

00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:12,094

Eh?

62
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,951
- Good morning.
- Morning.

63
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,867
You slept on the couch again.
Is your bed not comfortable?

64
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,956
My bed was shaking.

65
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,392
Shaking?

66
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,915
Maybe we had
another tremor.

[juice pouring]

00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,444
I have an idea.

Why don't you come to church
with me today.

70
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,491
Um...

71
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,014
I have so much
I need to get done

72
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,799
before school tomorrow.

73
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,931
Okay, well, I'm going to try
again next week.

74
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,413
I'll see you
when I get home.

75
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:11,806

[rumbling bang]

82
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,153
Aunt Tanya,
are you here?

83
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,334
Hello?

84
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,642
[Pastor John] The Lord says,

85
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,644
if your sins be a scarlet,

86
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,124
let them be made
white as snow.

87
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:21,996
And if they be red as crimson,

88
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,998
they shall be made
white as wool.

89
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,826
So it is important
to both forgive

90
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,610
and allow forgiveness

91
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,917
in order to receive
God's true blessings.

92
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,223
So remember that next time
someone swoops in

93
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,964
and steals your front-row
parking spot

94
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,097
- at the grocery store.
- [parishioners laugh]

95
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,186
Just like Mrs. Johnson
forgave me last night

96
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:41,145
when I accidentally swooped in
and stole her spot.

97
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,626
My bad, Mrs. Johnson.

98
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,628
And speaking of blessings,

99
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,762
I'm truly blessed to be welcomed
into this church community

100
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,807
with such loving
and open arms.

101
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,331
You've really made
this transition

102
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,725
this past two months
an easy one.

103
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,075
And I'm especially blessed

104
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,861
to receive the spiritual
guidance

105
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,776
and leadership
of Reverend Michael.

106

[applause]

107
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,134
Seems like we had
a good turnout today.

108
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,614
[Michael] Yes, we did.

109
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,660
I thought you did very well.

110
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,619
[Pastor John] I just need
to put together some readings

111
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,925
for the next youth meeting.

112
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:25,102
I see you found a title
for my personal collection.

113
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,018
Oh. Um...

114
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,498
yes, sorry.

115
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,500
It just caught my eye.

116
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,937
Well, that's okay.
Could you put it back, please?

117
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,417
Absolutely.

118
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,291
I didn't know that you were
into demonology and exorcism.

119
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,467
I was.

120
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,817
Well, I find it fascinating...

121
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,428
Some books are best left
on the shelf.

122
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,951
Of course.

123
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,615
All right, well, I'm off.

124
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,182
See you later.

125
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,705
[Michael] Good sermon.

Ashley?

131
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,327
Hello?

132
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:17,508
Hey.

133
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,510
You don't remember me,
do you?

134
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,034
It's Hannah.

[laughs]

136
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,342
Hey.

137
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,953
It's amazing.
You look exactly the same,

138
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,781
except older and taller.

139
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,218
Do I look the same?

140
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,567
You're taller.

141
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,962
Where did you guys
end up going?

142
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,920
You kind of just disappeared.

143
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,401
It's messed up how we didn't
even get to say goodbye.

144
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,751
Yeah, we went up north.

145
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,755
That's a cute necklace.
Where did you get it?

146
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,192
- It's so vintage.
- Thanks. It was my mom's.

147
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,933
It's cool.

148
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,980
How's your sister?
Where's she at nowadays?

149
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,460
She's good, she got
a scholarship to Penn State.

150
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:59,811
[Hannah]
What brought you guys back?

151
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,771
Jesus, once I escape,
I am never coming back.

152
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:06,209
Do you remember the last time
you were here?

153
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,732
[Ashley] It was a long time ago.

154
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,738
[Hannah]
Nothing much has changed, so...

155
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,915
- [Ashley] Yeah.
- [Hannah] Won't be different.

156
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,702
[Ashley]
So, what do you do around here?

157
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,399
[Hannah] Gosh.

158
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,314
Um, we go to the lake.

159
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,968
We...

160
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,317
you know.

161
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,971
[Ashley] Yeah.

162
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,886
[Hannah]
Go to the movies. That's fun.

163
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,889
There's a couple cute boys
at school.

164
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,717
This is it.

165
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:41,592
Your room's a little crazy,
friend.

166
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,855
What is all this stuff?

167
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,553
Oh, this is my gear.

168
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,294
The Mormons might
be kind of weird,

169
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,513
but they're onto something.

170
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,776
Onto what?

171
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,822
Angels and demons
walking the earth.

172
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,476
I know, it sounds crazy,

173
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,130
but I've been reading
a lot about it,

174
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,175
and it all sounds so epic.

175
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:02,004
Just want to make sure I'm ready
in case anything ever happens.

176
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:05,138
- Serious? Angels and demons?
- Yes, seriously.

177
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,140
Demons are serious stuff.

178
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,838
Haven't you ever seen
"The Exorcist"?

179
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:12,667
Once Regan used that Ouija board
to invite Captain Howdy in,

180
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,060
she was fucked.

181
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,410
I've never seen it.

182
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,542
You never seen "The Exorcist"?

183
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,936
- [cell phone chimes]
- We have to watch it one night.

184
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,377
Do you remember Shane Stevens?

185
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,205
He was the nerdy kid
with the turtle.

186
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,338
He'd follow us around the gym.
Had a crush on you.

187
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,166
Kinda.

188
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,777
He's hot and single, and we're
hanging out tonight.

189
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,431
Do you want to come?

190
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,389
I don't know, Hannah.

191
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,739
You're invited.
You're coming.

192
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,981
- [thumping overhead]
- [wheezing breath]

193
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,244
- [objects clatter overhead]
- [door opens]

194
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,174
[keys jingle]

195
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,095
Oh, there you are.
I thought you were upstairs.

196
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:36,142
Hi, I'm Hannah.
You must be Aunt Tanya.

197
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,579
Yeah. Miss Winbourne,
or Aunt Tanya.

198
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:40,015
"Tanya" is good.

199
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,235
- [laughs]
- [Hannah] Cool.

200
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,063
What are you guys up to? I was just going to
make dinner. Do you wanna stay for dinner?

201
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,500
Oh, no. Hannah are I were going
to go to the dock

202
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,067
and hang out
with a bunch of friends.

203
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,764
Oh, you were going to go?

204
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,592
Do you mind if we go?

205
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,855
Just don't be late.
You have school tomorrow.

206
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,683
Yeah, we won't.
We won't be.

207
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:59,121
Okay. Do you know what happened
with that picture?

208
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,123
Yeah, I found a school picture
of Mom,

209
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,994
and I thought
I'd put it up there.

210
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,213
Is that all right?

211
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,823
Yeah, it's fine.

212
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,390
Whatever you need
to feel at home.

213
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,175
I'm gonna run upstairs
and get changed.

214
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,002
- Okay.
- It was nice to meet you,

215
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:15,964
Aunt Tanya, or Tanya,
or Miss Winbourne.

216
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,500
Ooh!

217
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,111
[laughs]

218
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,590
Ooh, you're so creepy.

219
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,853
[laughs]

220
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,208
[hip-hop music playing]

221
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,736
- [Hannah] Carrie!
- [Carrie] Hannah's here.

222
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,781
[Hannah] What is up?

223
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:54,045
- The life of the party is here.
- Finally. Took you long enough.

224
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,525
How are you?

225
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,440
Great. Good to see you.

226
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:59,616
I thought I'd spend
more time with my girl.

227
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,575
- Your girl?
- [laughs]

228
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,707
You know what I'm saying.

229
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,539
So, everyone, this is our
long-lost friend, Ashley,

230
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,846
You may know her as
the little girl from art class.

231
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,979
But as you can see, she's fully
grown to start some trouble.

232
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:17,939
- [Bryce] Whoo!
- So, friends, Ashley.

233
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,897
- Ashley, friends.
- Nice to meet you, Ashley.

234
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,943
Hey, I'm Bryce.
Call me Big Bryce. Big Bryce.

235
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,205
[laughs]

236
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,641
Hey.

237
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,382
[Hannah] How are you?

238
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,949
[indistinct chatter]

239
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,951
[Bryce]
Get you something to drink.

240
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,214
- It's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you too.

241
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,563
It's been a while.

242
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,086
Yeah.

243
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,915
Well, make yourself
at home and...

244
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,352
let's party.

245
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,570
[all chatter excitedly]

246
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,877
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm good.

247
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,748
Oh, yeah, I don't drink either.
It's cool.

248
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,794
- All right.
- Let's go.

249
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,191
Do you remember me?

250
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,062
Yeah.

251
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,978
You used to follow us
around gym.

252
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,022
Oh, man.

253
00:19:58,632 --> 00:19:59,981
How's your pet turtle?

254
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:01,025
Myrtle?

255
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,768
She wasn't long for this world,
I guess.

256
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,335
She, uh...

257
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:07,641
she's in a better place.

258
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:09,208
[laughs]

259
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,822
It's good to have you back.

260
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,345
Thanks.

261
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,916
[crickets chirping]

262
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,617
Hey, I know something fun.

263
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,663
Do you guys have that new
EVP app?

264
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,404
What, the stupid
"Ghost Hunters" shit?

265
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,058
- You're such a dork.
- Yeah, a cute dork.

266
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,277
What's EVP?

267
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:36,974
Oh, my God. Check it out.

268
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,760
EVP is "electronic
voice phenomenon."

269
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:42,241
It's the app they use in all
those ghost-hunting shows.

270
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,895
- It totally works.
- I got it on my phone here.

271
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,767
- Of course you do.
- [all laugh]

272
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,204
- Dude, he's so whipped.
- [imitates whip cracking]

273
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,598
Everyone, listen, the phone's
going to pick up anything

274
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:54,731
from the spirit world: voices,
paranormal activity, anything.

275
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,124
Listen.

276
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,389
Are there any spirits out there
that want to talk to us?

277
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,915
I don't know, Hannah.
This is kind of weird.

278
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,569
Come on,
don't worry about it.

279
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,179
I'm sure this stuff
doesn't even work.

280
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,398
[Bryce] You guys hear that?

281
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:11,487
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,316
I think it's saying for the
girls to show us their boobs.

283
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,318
I'm sure that's what you heard,
perv.

284
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:19,408
No, but really, listen.

285
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:21,541
[ghostly voice, whispering]
Ashley.

00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,551

- [shrieks]
- [screams]

289
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,697
What the hell
is wrong with this girl?

290
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,873
[Hannah]
Are you okay? What's wrong?

291
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:53,442
I don't know.
I think I saw my mom.

292
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,401
You're such a dick, Bryce.

293
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,446
- Ashley, wait up.
- Dude, what's your problem?

294
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,144
She's screaming, we're trying
to have a good, quiet evening.

295
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:02,277
I'm leaving.
Are you coming?

296
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,453
I drove you here,
so you better come.

297

[Tanya] Ashley, you okay?

306
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,758
Yeah, I'm fine,
Aunt Tanya.

307
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,151
I'm taking a bath.

308
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,631
[Tanya] Okay.

[knock on door]

00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,707
Come in.

313
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:56,625
Hey. How was your thing
with your friends?

314
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,105
It was okay.

315
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:02,065
You look so much
like your mom.

316
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,895
That's her necklace, isn't it?

317
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,941
Yeah.

318
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:10,857
I've worn it since
I was a little kid.

319
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,294
It's like a little
piece of her.

320
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:18,299
You know, I bought that for her
on her 16th birthday.

321
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,735
[laughs]

322
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,740
I hope you know how happy I am
to have you here, Ashley.

323
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,047
I do.

324
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,179
I just wish
Jordan was here.

325
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,529
I know.

326
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,444
It's going to be okay.

327
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:35,316
You know that, right?

328
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:39,059
How do you know?

329
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:41,191
Because I know.

330
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:44,543
And I know that God never gives
us more than we can handle.

331
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,157
I just feel like
he's given me a lot,

332
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,073
and I'm really trying
to handle it all.

333
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:55,031
I know you are.

334
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,295
But you are so strong.

335
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:01,255
You're going
to get through this.

336
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:04,954
And if there's anything I can do
to make you feel more at home,

337
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,739
please let me know.

338
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,828
Thank you.

All right, you get some sleep,
sweetie, okay?

344
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,753
I'll see you in the morning.

345
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:22,842
- Good night.

00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,203
Okay?

359
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,683
Thanks, Sam.

360
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,828
Good morning.

[indistinct chattering]

00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:13,316
Pastor John,
what's the word?

364
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,058
Oh, hey, Sam. Same as always.
God's word.

365
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,371
Ashley?

366
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,809
Yeah?

367
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,332
Hi. I'm...

368
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,812
I'm John.

369
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:34,381
I'm the new pastor
at Celebration.

370
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:37,384
I work a lot
with the youth ministry,

371
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:39,821
and your Aunt Tanya
told me a lot about you.

372
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,475
Okay.

373
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,261
Well, how are you doing?

374
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,002
I mean, are you happy
to be back?

375
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,832
Yeah. It's all right.

376
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:53,269
Well, what's left of it.

377
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:55,054
Yeah.

378
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:57,360
I know the feeling.

379
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,886
Well, I like this part of town.

380
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,583
I feel like it's got
a lot of personality.

381
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,283
I kind of feel like
it's the last link to the past.

382
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:13,986
You know, we got a lot of really
great events planned at church.

383
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:17,119
It'd be really nice
to see you there sometime.

384
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:20,427
Yeah, it'd be cool.

385
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:24,692
Is that the 7D?

386
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:26,825
Yeah, it sure is.

387
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:29,349
That's right, Tanya told me
that you're into photography.

388
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,003
Yeah, I love it.
I have the Mark V,

389
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,483
but I heard the VII
takes better pictures.

390
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,181
Yeah, the picture quality
is great.

391
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:38,532
It just... sometimes
the exposure's off.

392
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,621
Maybe you could
take a look at it?

393
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:42,666
Yeah.

394
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,930
You know, I'm always looking
for talented photographers

395
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,845
to take pictures
at church events.

396
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:49,282
I'd love to. Can I get back
to you about that?

397
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:51,632
- Okay, great.
- Pastor John. Hey.

398
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:53,764
- Hey. I'll see you Sunday.
All right.

399
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:56,811
Hannah, haven't seen you
at church in a while.

400
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:00,467
I see you smiling.

401
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,947
What, you think he's hot?

402
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:04,906
No, but he's pretty cool.

403
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,734
Yeah, okay, you know
for a pastor.

404
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:08,040
Whatever.

405
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,130
Hey, are you okay?

406
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,827
Freaked out yesterday.

407
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,612
Yeah, it was nothing.

408
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:17,136
It was something.

409
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:18,746
Did you see something?

410
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,748
What were you saying
about your mom?

411
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:25,144
I don't know.
My mind's playing tricks on me.

412
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,059
Are you sure?
Because it just seemed...

413
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,974
Hannah, it was nothing.

414
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,933
Whatever you say, Ash.
But it was definitely something.

the next EVP session?

417
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,199
- I want in.
- Come on, man, knock it off.

418
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,940
You guys want a ride to school?

419
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:41,247
Really? This is our workout
for the day.

420
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,989
And besides, the school's
right up the street, dumbasses.

421
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,512
All right, fine,
but you're missing out

422
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,166
on the pleasure of our company.

423
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,864
See you later, ladies.

It's Shane.

I gave him your number.

What are you doing?

433
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:17,022
I don't know.
What do you think?

- Hey.
- Hey, have you seen Ashley?

440
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,786
I've been texting her all day
and she's not responding.

441
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,484
I was actually about to ask you.

442
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,007
I was going to see
if she needed a ride.

443
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:47,269
Did you hear what happened?

444
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,792
Yeah, is she okay?

445
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:51,012
There she is.

446
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:54,842
Hey, Ashley,
what happened to you?

447
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,539
- Nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.

448
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,585
You almost gave Mr. Diggler
a heart attack.

449
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,891
I just want to go home.

450
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,719
All right, just stay here.

451
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,983
I'll go get my truck
and I can take you home, okay?

00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:07,942
Did you see
your mom again?

No, Ashley, there's something
going on with you.

that's it.

I just want to say that
I'm sorry about this morning.

to check on you.

I just got off the phone
with your principal.

So call me when you can, okay?

470
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,460
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah, no problem.

tomorrow?

Yeah.

- Hey!
- [gasps]

497
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:26,869
Hannah, you can't...
shit, scare me like that.

498
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:29,394
- Sorry. I'll knock next time.
- Oh, my gosh.

499
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:32,440
You were just, like,
knocking all over the house.

500
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:34,442
What are you talking about?

501
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:37,576
[scoffs]
Very funny.

502
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,882
It wasn't me, but okay.

503

[sniffs]

504
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,146
What's that smell?

505
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,061
I don't know.

506
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:47,150
Something must have died
in the vent or something.

507
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:51,372
Hey, is that a Bible?
We're going to need it.

508
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,809
[match strikes]

[blows]

510
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,035
So, what are we doing?

511
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,080
[Hannah] This is my first time
trying this.

512
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,692
Do you remember that EVP thing
that I showed you last night?

513
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,563
Well, this is way better
for communicating

514
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:10,435
with one specific
dead person.

515
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:13,612
- It's totally old-school.
- I don't know, Hannah.

516
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:16,528
Trust me. We have to figure
out if this is actually your mom

517
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,181
trying to reach out to you.

518
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,488
- What if it's...
- What if what?

519
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,621
What if it works?

520
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:28,278
What's your mom's first name?
It's super important.

521
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,107
Sarah.

522
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:34,067
Okay. If Sarah reveals
herself to you,

523
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,722
you have to acknowledge her
and ask her to come back to you.

524
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:39,289
That way, we can figure out
what's keeping her here.

525
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,553
Okay.

526
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:44,164
Okay. Let's begin.

527
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:48,821
Hello, Sarah.

528
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:51,171
I'm Hannah, and I'm here
with your daughter, Ashley.

529
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,303
She'd like to speak with you.

530
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,524
Will you communicate
with us?

531
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:04,880
Sarah, if you're here,
give us a sign.

532
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:06,534
Hannah, what's with
this mirror?

533
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,536
Should we close our eyes
or something?

534
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,278
No, I think the mirrors acts as
a conduit to the spirit world.

535
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:14,107
We have to look directly into it
in order to see your mom.

536
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,067
Sarah, please speak now.

537
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:24,422
Sarah, please come forward
and speak with your daughter.

538
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:26,467
- [wind rushing]
- [voice whispers]

539
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,600
What the hell?
Did you hear that?

540
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,472
- Yeah. What was that?
- I don't know.

541
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,256
Sarah, show us
that you're here.

542
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,650
[wind roars]

543
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,913
What the hell? I saw something.
What did you see?

544
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,437
I don't... I don't know.

545
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,743
Call her, Ashley.
She's here.

546
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,484
- Mom.
- Ask her again.

547
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,399
Mom, are you here?

548
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,532
Please, Mom, I'm begging you,
I want you in my life.

549
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:50,665
Will you please come back to me?
I love you. Please!

550
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,189
[demonic chuckle]

551
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,670
What did you do?

552
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:58,020
I did what you told me to do.

553
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:01,763
[Hannah]
This doesn't feel right.

554
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:03,548
[Ashley] What do you mean?

555
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,727
[inhuman growl]

556
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:17,475
Hey, it's freezing in here.

557
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:20,782
What are you guys doing?

558
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:22,349
What is that smell?

559
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:24,003
I should probably get going.

560
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:26,484
- Bye, Miss Winbourne.
- Hannah, wait.

561
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,924
Hannah, wait.

562
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,449
We're messed up.

563
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,539
That shadow was dark.
I'm not sure it was your mom.

564
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,715
- I just...
- What do you mean?

565
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:42,238
I don't know.

566
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:44,327
I'll see you.

567
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:55,904
[Tanya]
Well, she left in a hurry.

568
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:58,777
- What's going on?
- Nothing. It was nothing.

569
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,431
Next you'll tell me what
happened in school is nothing?

570
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:03,477
I don't want to talk about it.

571
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,436
- Okay, Ashley...
- I don't want to talk about it!

572
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,358
Listen, Ashley, you may not
want to talk to me

573
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,056
about every single thing
you're doing,

574
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,537
but you will not
disrespect me.

575
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,627
I'm sorry, Aunt Tanya.

576
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,065
I didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

577
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:30,330
Look, this isn't easy
for me either.

578
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,336
I'm sorry, okay?
Today was really hard.

579
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:39,600
Is there anything
I can do to help?

580
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,690
I don't think so.

581
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,736
How about we have
a movie night?

582
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:48,348
We can watch something light,
we can pig out on popcorn.

583
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:51,569
It was your mom and my favorite
thing to do.

584
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:54,876
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

585
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,270
[indistinct chatter over TV]

586
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,981
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

587
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:20,946
So, tell me more about
you and mom's movie nights.

588
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:23,818
Oh, they were our favorite
things to do.

589
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:25,603
[laughs]

590
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,344
Mostly, it was just an excuse
to stay up late

591
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:31,652
and talk about boys
and school.

592
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:32,871
And boys.

593
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,307
[both laugh]

594
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,309
We talked about
everything.

595
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:40,922
Did she ever talk
about wanting to be a mom?

596
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:43,055
Or having kids?

597
00:43:57,722 --> 00:43:59,724
[fire crackling]

598

[Michael] I've preparest

599
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,776
in the presence
of mine enemies.

600
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,257
Thou anoints...

601
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,652
I... I have failed.

602
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,177
I have failed you.

603
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,744
I have failed thee.

604
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,965
I need to tell you something.

605
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:26,533
- Okay.
- [sighs]

606
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:28,840
I'm pregnant.

607
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,931
Tanya, listen.

608
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,065
There's something
going on with me.

609
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,722
I'm hearing these voices
in my head.

610
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,464
And it's... it's making me
do things.

611
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:46,640
Really bad things.

612
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,859
[sniffles]

613
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:49,948
And I can't control it.

614
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:52,951
I don't know what you mean,
that you can't control it.

615
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:55,170
- I need your help.
- I don't...

616
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:56,650
Tanya...

617
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:58,870
You need to see someone.

618
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,741
You need medical help.

619
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:02,525
- Sarah...
- I'm scared.

620
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,443
Please, Tanya,
just pray with me, okay?

621
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:09,097
Okay, okay, okay.

622
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:11,839
Dear heavenly Father,

623
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:13,623
please watch over Sarah.

624
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,625
Please cast out
her afflictions

625
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:19,238
and heal her mind
and her thoughts and action.

626
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:21,936
- Please watch over my sister.

What is it?

630
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:30,684
What are you saying, Sarah.

631
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,991
- You don't believe me.
- I do.

632
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:35,210
I don't know what to do.

633
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:37,212
[in demonic voice]
You don't believe me.

634

- [gasps]
- Aunt Tanya?

635
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:40,781
Ashley.

636
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,609
Oh, God, I'm...

637
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:45,351
- Are you okay?
- I must have had a nightmare.

638
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:48,658
I'm sorry I fell
asleep on you.

639
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:50,443
No, it's okay.

640
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,227
Um...

641
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:54,577
You know, I'm going
to go to bed.

642
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:56,797
I don't think you'll like
the movie anyways.

643
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:58,668
It doesn't have
a happy ending.

644
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:00,714
No, you know what?
I'm...

645
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,499
I'm going to head to bed too.
It's way past my bedtime.

646
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:05,545
You sleep good, angel.

647

00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:50,345
Ashley, what happened
to your shoulder?

661
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:52,434
Oh, I just bumped into some
branches in the woods.

662
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:54,741
It doesn't look like
you just bumped into branches.

663
00:47:54,784 --> 00:47:56,612
- Let me see.
- I got to go, I'm late.

664
00:47:56,656 --> 00:47:58,005
Bye.

665
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:20,549
Hey.

666
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:22,029
Hi.

667
00:48:22,073 --> 00:48:23,683
Ready to go?

668
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:25,467
Yeah.

669
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:28,688
I was thinking after
what happened yesterday,

670
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,777
we could use a little
adventure.

671
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,257
What do you say?

672
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:35,608
I say, get in.

673
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:36,914
All right.

674
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:43,224
Wait, where are you going?

675
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:45,139
Hop in.

your eyes,

you can feel that my hands
are going to move a lot faster.

679
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,677
You want me
to close my eyes?

680
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,332
Yeah, close your eyes.
Trust me.

00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,725
You ready?

682
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,251
Oh, come on.

683
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,514
- I'm going easy on you.
- Oh, really?

684
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:57,124
- Yeah.
- Close your eyes.

685
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,562
All right.

686
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:06,003
- Last one.
- Okay.

687
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,830
- Actually try this time.
- All right.

688

Ow.

689
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,141
Jeez.

690
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:16,404
So, what's it like
being back?

691
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:19,190
I don't know.
Do you like my outfit?

692
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,888
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

693
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:24,108
Then come closer.

694
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:26,501
Okay.

695
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,683
Do I scare you?

696
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:37,382
- Do you scare me?
- Yeah.

697
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:39,340
No, you don't scare me.

698
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:41,908
Then kiss me.

699
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,268
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
come on.

700
00:50:54,312 --> 00:50:56,401
Slow down a bit.
We don't have to go that fast.

701
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:58,229
Oh, come on,
isn't this what you want?

702
00:50:58,272 --> 00:50:59,665
I guess.

703
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,539
Hold on. Ashley,
I just want to see something.

704
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,237

I'm sorry, what?

No, she left this morning
for school.

Are you sure?

717
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:44,710
Okay, thank you.

Of course.

770

Doubt is part of humanity.

I doubt and I question,

Spare me the seminary

Not just in him,
but in yourself.

Your goodness.

777
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:33,895
Your ability to fight
for goodness in others.

778
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:36,811
Hmm.

779
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:42,121
I believe there's a name
for that.

780
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:43,949
- A wavering assurance.
- Oh, that's right.

781
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:46,386
We're always quick
with the names, aren't we?

782
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,780
To name is to destroy.

783
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,133
There was a time when I was
pretty good at that:

784
00:55:54,176 --> 00:55:55,613
naming.

785

Goodness and God, love.

786
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,012
Wish I could name it now.

787
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,580
Hmm.

788
00:56:07,886 --> 00:56:09,844
I'm afraid I don't follow.

789
00:56:11,846 --> 00:56:13,761
Well, you won't, Reverend.

790
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:16,851
To destroy your
wavering assurance?

791
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,419
To find peace
in your own goodness?

792
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,290
What do I want?

793
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:23,031
What do I want more
than anything?

794
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:26,774
More than finding peace
in my own goodness?

795
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:31,300
I want to destroy
the darkness.

796
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:35,783
I want to make it right
for all those souls

797
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:37,829
that I have failed.

798
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:44,183
Then that is what
I will help you do.

799
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:48,448
And into the presence
of the Lord, there is no doubt.

800
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,276
Yes.

801
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,105
In the presence of the Lord,
there is no doubt.

802
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,457
[nurse] That was more blood

803
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,939
than I have seen come out of
anybody nose in my whole life.

804

00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:08,599
- How is she?
- She's fine.

807
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:10,470
It's just a nosebleed.

808
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,516
Just a nosebleed?
There was blood everywhere.

809
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,648
Look, nosebleeds often look
much worse than they are.

810
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:17,303
It's the stress of the
environment could be the cause.

811
00:57:17,346 --> 00:57:19,697
Change affects each of us
very differently.

812
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,351
No, I'm... I'm really
worried about her.

813
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:24,049
You don't need
to worry, Tanya.

814
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:25,833
No, you weren't there.
You didn't see her.

demonic stages.

The first is infestation.

A demon will be active

The second is oppression.

This is when the demon
is focused

on one specific person
or individual.

942
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:44,669
The demon will take the form
of a loved one to earn trust.

943
01:07:44,712 --> 01:07:46,845
The final stage
is possession.

944
01:07:46,888 --> 01:07:49,152
This is when the person
invites a demon in,

allowing the demon
to take complete control.

The only way to defeat
the demon

is to unlock
