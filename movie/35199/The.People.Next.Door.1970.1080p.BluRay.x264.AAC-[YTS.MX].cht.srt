1
00:00:51,260 --> 00:01:22,823
被爱的波浪束缚在雨的房子里，呢喃的情歌，他们说你提供痛苦，但在雷声和美好的外衣之间撕裂
J shackled by the waves of love j within the house of rain j the madrigal of whispering j they say you offer pain j but torn between the thunder j and the undercoat of nice

00:01:23,417 --> 00:02:03,282

j I walk among the pimpernels j and towers made of ice j sweet medusa j I'd love to play your game j sweet medusa j deny the house of rain

3
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:40,525
沙漏原谅过去，致敬太阳，别理会你听到偶像的声音，你赢得了他们的高杯，你鹅卵石的边缘，被风系住
J the hourglass forgives the past j pay tribute to the sun j ignore the idol's voice you hear j their goblets you have won j the edges of your cobblestone j are fastened to the wind

你不能跟着它跳舞。
You can't dance to it.

7
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,802

Well, you see, er... - This is a different sound. - Well, I don't want a different sound.

8
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,183
-我们能休息一下吗?——没有。
- Well, can we just play breaks? - No.

- Look, we'll give you a week for nothing! - You ain't worth it.

11

我们要让他跟着跳舞!

12
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,485

- All right, all right! - Drop dead, you ugly bastard.

15
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,372
我想这个标志现在终于拼出来了。
I think that sign's finally spelled right now.

16
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:20,499
千变万化的风，呼唤着我的名字，向我招手，“来吧”
J winds of change, they call my name j and beckon, "come"

17
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,086
就像飞蛾扑火一样
j just like a moth to a flame

18
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:37,141

j child of spring j the scriptures bring you everything j don't break the link in the chain

19
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:46,867

哇!大卫，你怎么从来没做过这种事?

00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,293
-我以为上限是三个。-如果我们被抓的话
- I thought the limit was three. - That's if we get caught.

53
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,930
另外两个呢?
What happened to the other two?

54
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,224
他们是跛子帮。他们成群结队地跑到草丛中去了。
They were crips. They flocked off into the weeds.

55
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,597

哦，我儿子真棒，不是吗?

说到儿子，我想知道我们的儿子怎么样了?阿蒂?
Speaking of sons, I wonder what's become of ours? Artie?

61
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,512
——……他感觉不舒服。-他头痛。
- He's... he's not feeling well. - He has a headache.

62
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:20,071
带着十五磅的头发到处跑，谁都会头疼的。-他是不是很有趣?亚瑟，你真有趣!
Well, carrying fifteen pounds of hair around - would give anybody a headache. - Isn't he funny? Arthur, you're so funny!

63
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,532
我想我们得走了。来吧,蒂娜。

72
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,529
那他为什么不下来呢?
Well, why doesn't he come down?

73
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,492
烤鸭!

75

现在,阿蒂…阿蒂?向下走!
Now, Artie... Artie? Come on down!

76

我不太饿。
I'm not very hungry.

77
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,336
如果你不想吃，至少…把你的头发放下来!
Well, if you don't wanna eat, at least send... Send your hair down!

78
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,547
我想他想练习。
I think he wants to practise.

79
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,263
实践中,嗯?他是这么说的吗?

80
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,968
地狱!加油,亚瑟!
Hell! Come on, Arthur!

81
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,767
-别这样，亲爱的。-好吧，但为什么这么自私?
- Come on now, honey. - All right, but why be selfish?

82
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,562
没必要让他的头发挨饿!
No need for his hair to starve!

83
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,442
你为什么就不能让他好好想想他的头发?
Why can't you leave him alone about his hair?

84
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,608
只是因为它的长度和你的不一样!
Just because it isn't the same length as yours!

85
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,196
我到底做了什么?
What the hell did I do?

86
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,456
你们俩什么时候才能停止调音开始演奏?
When are you two gonna stop tuning up and start playing something?

87
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,299

Come on, sis, let's play some real music.

桑迪带来了一些奶酪蛋糕。
Sandy brought some cheesecake.

91
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,685
很好。他们只是为了逗老人开心，桑迪。
Fine. They're just playing this to amuse the old man, Sandy.

92
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,566
他们不喜欢是因为它有旋律。
They don't like it because it has a melody.

93
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,239
我打赌他们比你想的更喜欢，梅森先生。
You know, I bet they like it better than you think, mr Mason.

94
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,277

- No, no, I gotta be goin'. - Thanks for the cheesecake, Sandy.

96

谁能要求更多?这才是你应该玩的东西。
J who could ask for anything more? J now that's the kinda stuff you oughta play.

97
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,456
人们想听的东西。
The kinda stuff people wanna hear.

98
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,584
其他的东西，没人会付你一分钱的。
That other stuff, nobody'll pay you a dime for that.

99
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,880
-爸爸，让我告诉你…-马克西，算了
- Dad, let me tell you something... - Oh, maxie, never mind.

100
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,764
既然万能的美元是你判断一切的方式，我有消息告诉你。
Since the almighty dollar is your way of judging everything, I've got news for you.

101
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,430
阿迪和他的团队找到了一份工作，从今晚开始，周薪200。
Artie and his group have got a job, starting tonight, paying two hundred a week.

102
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,845
阿迪，是真的吗?
Artie, is that true?

103
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:34,398
我本打算今晚穿上戏服告诉你的，但是…但是那太好了!
Yeah, well, I was gonna tell you tonight, when I had my costume on, but... But that's wonderful!

104
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,476
200美元，对吧?
Two hundred bucks, huh?

105
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,486
有些人钱比脑子还多。
Well, some people have more money than brains.

106
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:50,827
五角大楼今天说，目前的行动是美国和南越合作的一个例子，把越共赶出关键的水稻种植区。
Pentagon said today that the present operation is an example of American and south vietnamese co-operation, driving the viet cong out of critical rice-growing areas.

107
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,964
前进中的美军部队在猛烈的轻武器火力下占领了前沿阵地。你在开玩笑吧。
Advancing American units seized forward positions under intense small-arms fire... You gotta be kidding.

108
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,669
你不会就这样跑到街上去吧?
You're not going out on the street like that, are ya?

109
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,464
文明到底发生了什么?
Whatever happened to civilisation?

110
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,838
这是我们关系的一部分。
It's part of our thing, you know.

111
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,762
你的事情,嗯?
Your thing, huh?

112
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:13,187
好吧，你可能很快就会做他们的事了，所以你还是趁现在好好享受吧。
Well, you'll probably be doing their thing soon, so you might as well have fun while you can.

113
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,813
把那玩意儿关了，好吗?我受够了。
Oh, shut that stuff off, will ya? I'm sick of it.

-什么事?-我不喜欢。

120
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,461
太远了。太远了。
It's too far. Too far.

121
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,543
我想回家!
I wanna go home!

122
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,507
我听说山。

你在说什么?她怎么了?
What are you talkin' about? What's the matter with her?

143
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,032
你能安静一分钟吗?你听说过LSD吗?

00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,693
那么，该死的，我会的。
Then, goddamn it, I will.

198
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:29,413
她开始跟你那帮怪胎混在一起的时候我就知道会发生这样的事。
I knew something like this was gonna happen when she started hanging out with that freaky gang of yours.

199
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,717
肯定就在这里。
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

离你妹妹远点，听见了吗?

You... Now, you listen to me, you no-good punk!

204

If your sister suffers any kind of damage because of this, any permanent damage, you better start runnin', because I'm comin' after you, and I'll break every bone in your body!

她为什么要拿走那些东西?
Why would she take that stuff, anyhow?

211
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,844
她是不是疯了?
Is she nuts or somethin'?

212
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,302
完美的孩子，正常的孩子，什么都有。
Perfect kid, normal as they come, a kid who's got everything.

213
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,140
我觉得我们应该找人谈谈。
I think we ought to talk to somebody.

大卫呢?

216
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,136
我不会让隔壁的人干涉我的私生活!——亚瑟,请。
I'm not getting the people next door - involved in my private life! - Arthur, please.

217
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,325

…-求助大卫?-我就是这么说的。
- I want her to go to sleep. - Listen, gerrie, if you feel you have to turn to... To David at a time like... - Turn to David? - That's what I said.

218
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,781
-我们需要建议。-你不相信我的判断?
- We need advice. - You don't trust my judgement?

219
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:33,415
这不是你的东西，亚瑟。
Oh, it's not your anything, Arthur.

220
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,916
这是我们的。

我们失败。我们必须面对这一点。
We're failing. We have to face that.

如果你想去找蒂娜和大卫，就去吧!

让我告诉你一件事。

225
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,764
明白了吗?这是你的责任。
Is that clear? It's your responsibility.

226
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,055
去做吧。走了。
Go ahead. Go.

227
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,026
你知道吗，亚瑟?
You know something, Arthur?

228
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:04,112
每次我们遇到危机，需要做决定的时候，你都会对我发火。
Every time we come to any kind of a crisis, where... Where a decision has got to be made, you get furious at me.

229
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,245
这是一个谎言。
That's a lie.

230
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,243
并拒绝承担任何责任。
And refuse to take any responsibility.

那是谎话，你知道的。

Oh... oh, yes. Yes, I imagine.

236

Well, there's nothing much doing on TV tonight, so Gloria and I thought we'd rather look at you and Arthur through a Martini. What do you think?

00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,431
法西斯猪!
Fascist pigs!

252
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,479
你没有搜查令!
You ain't got no warrant!

253
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,312
胡志明!胡志明!
Ho chi minh! Ho chi minh!

254
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,693
-滚出去!-小心玻璃。
- Get outta here! - Watch the glass.

255
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,866
喂!喂!胡志明!
Ho! Ho! Ho chi minh!

256
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,409
我们谁也赢不了!
None of us is gonna win!

257
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,987
喂!喂!胡志明!
Ho! Ho! Ho chi minh!

258
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,824
别碰我!你以为你是谁?!
Get your hands off of me! Who do you think you are?!

259
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,013
——噢,嗨。- - - - - -大卫。
- Oh, hi. - David.

260
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,788
我的一些学生明年上大学需要这些记录。-这太可怕了。
Some of my students are gonna need these records - to get into college next year. - This is terrible.

261
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,372
-我们不应该打扰你。-没事的。一切都结束了。
- We shouldn't be bothering you. - It's all right. It's all over.

262
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,352
现在只是一项清理工作。亚瑟……
It's just a clean-up job now. Arthur...

263
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,027
格里在电话里把细节都告诉我了。
Gerrie told me the bare details on the phone.

264
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:31,611
看看他们对你的办公室做了什么，大卫，而你是校长。
Look what they did to your office, David, and you're the principal.

265
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:35,320
大卫，你为这个世界上的孩子们做了什么?
David, what the hell do you do for kids in this world?

266
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,996
我们尽了一切可能。
We did everything humanly possible.

267
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:43,877
我是说，我们给她上了网球课，钢琴课，拉拉队，温馨的家，温馨的邻居。
I mean, we gave her tennis lessons, piano lessons, cheerleader, good home, good neighbourhood.

268
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,922
-给她爱。——爱?我们当然给了她爱。
- Gave her love. - Love? Of course we gave her love.

269
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,749
我知道，我知道。
I know, I know.

270
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:56,469
如果我们是一群神经质的…你知道我的意思. 那我就能理解了，但是……对不起，格里。你想坐下吗?
If we were a neurotic bunch of... You know what I mean. Then I could understand, but... Oh, excuse me, gerrie. Would you like to sit down?

271
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,424
不,我很好。
No, I'm fine.

272
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,997
在我们开始前你想喝点咖啡吗?
Would you like some coffee before we start?

273
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,433
哦,是的,请。只是黑色的。
Oh, yes, please. Just black.

274
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,310
你有一角硬币吗?是的。
Do you have a dime? Yes.

275
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:10,233
我不敢看他们在图书馆做的事，但我必须看。
I'm afraid to look at what they did in the library, but I've got to.

276
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,777
你觉得怎么样?正对着门。
How about that? Right through the door.

277
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,993
他们终于找到了书籍的用处。
They finally found a use for books.

278
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,406
哦,在这里,大卫。
Oh, here, David.

279
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,911
我不明白他们为什么不毁掉咖啡机。
I can't understand why they didn't destroy the coffee machine.

280
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,493
连我都同意咖啡机是资产阶级的阴谋。
Even I agree the coffee machine is a bourgeois plot.

281
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:45,056
我想玩你的游戏
J the filaments within j sweet medusa j I'd like to play your game j

282
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,738
我们的孩子什么事都可以来找我们。他们知道。
our children can come to us about anything. They know that.

283
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,532
如果他能让她说出内心的真实想法。
If he can get her to really say what she thinks, deep down.

284
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,701
-我就是这个意思。——他是对的。
- That's what I mean. - He's right.

285
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:05,243
她没说的那些事可能是因为她觉得你不想让她说。
All the things she may not have said because she may have thought that you didn't want her to.

286
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,702
但是我们做的!
But we did!

287
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,588
但你真的想这么做吗，亲爱的?
But did you really want to, sweetheart?

288
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,337
还是你害怕了?讲真话。
Or were you afraid? Tell the truth.

289
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:23,135
我…我必须承认是我自己的错，因为我没有早点坚持。但是…亲爱的，你会喜欢的。
I... I have to admit that I was at fault myself, because I didn't insist on it sooner. But... Oh, sweetheart, you're going to enjoy it.

290
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,973
你会比你想象的更了解你的女儿。
You'll get to know your daughter better than you ever dreamed possible.

291
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:31,610
听着，我不知道我们俩能不能受得了，但是…Geronimo !
Listen, I don't know if either one of us is gonna be able to stand it, but... Geronimo!

292
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,813
它就在我们身边，格里。
It's all around us, gerrie.

293
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:39,777
他们想让我们整个社会重新振作起来，动摇它，然后看看有什么会被淘汰。至少健康的人会。
They wanna pick our whole society up by the heels and shake it, and see what drops out. At least the healthy ones do.

294
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:44,365
其他人只是想摆脱它，用最好的方式。
The others just wanna try to get away from it, the best way they can.

295
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,537
是的,用药物。
Yeah, with drugs.

296
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,380
亲爱的，说起来好笑，我们很幸运。
Oh, sweetheart, in a funny way, we're lucky.

297
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,924
我们……我们一开始就发现了。
We... we caught this thing at the very beginning.

298
00:25:54,011 --> 00:26:01,974
好吧，我们的儿子死于这种疾病，或者疯狂，或者其他什么，但我们不能失去我们的女儿。
All right, we lost our son to this sickness, or craziness, or whatever it is, but we're not going to lose our little girl.

299
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,613
你好，电动踏板。
Hello, electric crash pad.

300
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,413
你好。
Hello.

301
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,752
我不明白你的意思，亲爱的。
I can't understand you, honey.

302
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,587
谁?
Who?

303
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,297
阿蒂?
Artie?

304
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,293
他是音乐家之一吗?
Is he one of the musicians?

305
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:42,340
有个醉鬼想给管风琴手留个口信。
Some drunk broad wants to leave a message for the organ player.

306
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,310
挂断电话!
Hang up!

307
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,889
喂?
Hello?

308
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,228
哦……
Oh...

309
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,436
我真希望能和拉弗蒂联系上。
I wish to hell I could get in touch with Rafferty.

310
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,826
我会取消那该死的网球比赛。
I'd cancel that damn tennis match.

311
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,496
我都睡不着了。
I'm not gonna get a wink of sleep.

312
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,918
网球!
Tennis!

313
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,376
我还能有什么条件反射?
What kinda reflexes am I gonna have?

314
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,888
马克西!马克西!
Maxie! Maxie!

315
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,439
哦,亲爱的。
Oh, darling.

316
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,187
一切……一切都是好的。
Everything's... Everything's all right.

317
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,018
现在没什么好哭的了。
There's nothing to cry about now.

318
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,186
亲爱的，那是个错误。
Darling, it was a mistake.

319
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,022
任何人都可能犯错误。
Anybody can make a mistake.

320
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,449
我们会忘记这一切的。
We're going to forget that it ever happened.

321
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,369
现在,。现在,现在,亲爱的。一切都是好的。
There, now. Now, now, darling. Everything's all right.

322
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,867
-不是吗，爸爸?-是的，宝贝，一切都好。
- Isn't it, daddy? - Yes, baby, everything's fine.

323
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,449
——很好。-我没办法。
- Just fine. - I can't help it.

324
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,417
亲爱的，试着停下来一会儿。
Well, darling, try to stop for a minute.

325
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,624
爸爸和我想跟你谈谈。
Daddy and I want to talk to you.

326
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,926
不是现在。请,不是现在。
Not now. Please, not now.

327
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,880
-你想继续睡觉吗?——不,我…我不能。
- Do you wanna go back to sleep? - No, I... I can't.

328
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,135
你有什么特别的事在哭吗?
Is there any particular thing you're crying about?

329
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,720
-宝贝，一切都好。-不，我只是想哭。
- Baby, everything's fine. - No, I just feel like crying.

330
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,814
来……
Come...

331
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,775
宝贝,我…
Baby, I...

332
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,786
-也许你该回去睡觉。-我不想睡觉
- Maybe if you went back to sleep. - I don't wanna sleep.

333
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,159
我要坐起来等阿迪。
I'm gonna sit up and wait for Artie.

334
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,535
-亲爱的…-让我来处理
- Darling... - Let me handle this.

335
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,794
马克西……马克西，我们知道那是阿迪给你带来的。
Maxie... Maxie, we know Artie brought you that stuff.

336
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,801
你做了什么?
What have you done?

337
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,846
——嗯…-我把他打发走了
- Well... - I sent him away.

338
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,631
阿蒂?
Artie?

339
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:53,136
-你把他赶出去了?-你父亲觉得…我们知道你有多爱你哥哥。
- You kicked him out? - Well, your father felt that... We know how much you love your brother.

340
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,188
别忘了，他是我们的儿子。
He's our son, don't forget.

341
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:59,772
这对我们来说也很难。……这对你父亲来说很难，比你想象的难多了。
This is hard for us, too. It's... it's hard for your father, much harder than you think.

342
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,569
你知道你是什么吗，爸爸?
You know what you are, daddy?

343
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,402
你是一个愚蠢的人。
You're a jackass.

344
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,654
她是想保护他。总是这样。
She's trying to protect him. It's always like this.

345
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,157
他撒谎，她也发誓。
He lies, and she swears to it.

346
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,705
你们都是愚蠢的。
You're both jackasses.

347
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,603
我想我们应该等到明天再谈。
I think we ought to wait till tomorrow to talk about it.

348
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,347
我觉得我们现在应该谈谈。
I think we ought to talk about it right now.

349
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,369
你不会喜欢的。
You're not going to like it.

350
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,876
我能来一口吗?
May I have a drag of that?

351
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,463
我不知道你抽烟。
I didn't know you smoked.

352
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,760
还有很多你不知道的。
There's a lot you don't know.

353
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,351
说吧。
Go ahead.

354
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,860
这不是我第一次被绊倒了。
This is not the first time I've tripped out.

355
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,860
我至少醒过十五次。
I've been up at least fifteen times.

356
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,567
我不相信你。我不相信你。
I don't believe you. I don't believe you.

357
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:53,663
所有的套路我都试过了，骑马都试过，但迷幻药是我的最爱。
I've tried all the grooves, even horse, but acid's my scene.

358
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,535
你……你说像…你从哪里得到这些词的?
You... you talk like... Where did you get these words?

359
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,620
这是我，爸爸。
This is me, daddy.

360
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,296
这就是我。
This is me.

361
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,499
我女儿生病了。我的小女儿病了。
My daughter's sick. My little girl is sick.

362
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,255
我没有生病。你。
I'm not sick. You are.

363
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,712
-所以你才这么痛苦。-我不痛苦。
- That's why you're so miserable. - I'm not miserable.

364
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,013
至少，我没有。
At least, I wasn't.

365
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,557
你知道吗，你应该少吃点迷幻药。
You know, you oughta drop a little acid.

366
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,719
像……看到上帝，妈妈。
Like... See god, mom.

367
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,977
看到上帝,不是吗?
See god, huh?

368
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,769
当我们在壁橱里发现你时，你真的看到了上帝。
You were really seeing god when we found you in that closet.

369
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,727
我经历了一次糟糕的旅行。这可能发生。
I was on a bad trip. That can happen.

370
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,609
不该用我的迷幻药。
Shouldn't have taken speed with my acid.

371
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,779
亚瑟，我要生病了。我得离开这里。
Arthur, I'm going to be ill. I have to get out of here.

372
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,449
不，亲爱的，听我说。
No, darling, listen to me.

373
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,996
,但是……-不，你就坐在这里。
- But... - No, you just sit down here.

374
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,502
给我。
Gimme that.

375
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:46,667
除了你那怪胎哥哥的影响，是什么让你开始做这个的?
Now, aside from your freaky brother's influence, what got you started on this stuff?

376
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,842
我哥哥的影响一直是让我不要再管这事了。
My brother's influence has always been to tell me to leave this whole scene alone.

377
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,469
我不相信，但你说啊。
I don't believe that, but go ahead.

378
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,472
我服用迷幻药是因为我想成为一个更好的人。
I took acid because I wanted to be a better person.

379
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,561
这是成为更好的人的好方法，好吗。
It's a fine way to be a better person, all right.

380
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:05,644
我想也是因为你和…妈妈和整个世界总是让我紧张。
And also, I guess, because you and... Mom and the world in general just keep me uptight all the time.

381
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,230
我们让你很紧张，是吗?
We keep you uptight, do we?

382
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,861
什么……我们怎么做呢?
What... now, how do we do that?

383
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,193
只是因为太荒唐了。
Just by being ridiculous.

384
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,203
你知道，愚蠢，虚伪。
You know, dumb, phoney.

385
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:20,913
你……换句话说，你恨我们。
You... In other words, you hate us.

386
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,588
是的,我……我想是的。
Yes, I... I think so.

387
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,586
你说我们很蠢。Waell……你能给我举个例子吗?
You say we're dumb. Waell... Can you give me an example?

388
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,763
就像我告诉你的，你相信。
Well, like everything I tell you, you believe.

389
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,094
例如呢?
For instance?

390
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:39,348
比如，如果我告诉你其中一个孩子很好，你俩都会说，哦，很好。
Like if I tell you one of the kids is nice, you both say, "oh, that's nice.

391
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,476
“然后你可以在那里过夜，因为那是一个很好的家庭。”
"Then you can spend the night over there because it's a nice family."

392
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,183
那孩子可能是你见过的最大的头。
And that kid might be the biggest head you ever saw.

393
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,894
换句话说，信任就是做一个傻瓜。
In other words, to trust is to be a fool.

394
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,238
你是个变态的人。
You are a sick person.

395
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,536
妈，我们没谈过我的性生活。
Mom, we didn't talk about my sex life.

396
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,864
有什么事吗?你不敢问吗?
What's the matter? You scared to ask?

397
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,496
你最大的怀疑是真的
Well, your worst suspicions are true.

398
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,855
你相信吗，今天早上?
Would you believe, this morning?

399
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,665
我不像你想的那样在医院。
I wasn't at the hospital like you thought.

400
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,587
我和一个男孩在一起。
I was with a boy.

401
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,381
你知道,做爱。
You know, fucking.

402
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,805
什么男孩?
What boy?

403
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,051
你想伤害他，对吧?
You'd try to hurt him, wouldn't you?

404
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,728
你才十六岁!
You're sixteen years old!

405
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,264
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

406
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,066
是那个叫艾略特的小子，对吧?
It was that Elliot boy, wasn't it?

407
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,105
对不起，爸爸，这事我只好让步了。
Sorry, daddy, I'll have to take the fifth on that.

408
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,856
不管怎样，在他前面还有一个。
Anyhow, there was another one before him.

409
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,366
已经有一年多了
For more than a year now.

410
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,615
别担心，妈妈，我不会有孩子的。
Oh, don't worry, mom, I'm not gonna have a baby.

411
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,037
我吃了避孕药。
I'm on the pill.

412
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,534
你……在哪里?
Where would you...?

413
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,207
你十六岁。你从哪儿弄来的?
You're sixteen. Where would you get such a thing?

414
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,002
很容易。所有的女孩都有。
It's easy. All the girls have 'em.

415
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,830
那些想要他们的人。
Ones that want them.

416
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,666
-我疯了吗?——没有。
- Am I losing my mind? - No.

417
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,128
-是我造成的吗?——没有。你真是个好妈妈。
- Did I cause this? - No. You've been a good mother.

418
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,783
我不会让你承担这一切的责任。
I'm not gonna let you take the blame for this.

419
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,718
她一点都不好，就是这样，她太坏了。
She's no good, that's all, she's rotten.

420
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,369
-家庭中有时也会发生。-她病了，她病了
- It happens in a family sometimes. - Oh, she's sick, she's sick.

421
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,348
你和爸爸在结婚前就这么做了。
You and daddy did it before you were married.

422
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,555
我听你说过。
I heard you talking about it.

423
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,423
你还记得莎伦吗，她去年常来我家过夜?
You remember Sharon, that used to come and spend the night with me last year?

424
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,234
伯纳德博士的女儿。
Dr Bernard's daughter.

425
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:18,197
她常常带着她父亲的听诊器，我们走进大厅，把听诊器挂在你卧室的门上。
Well, she used to bring her father's stethoscope, and we'd go into the hall and put the stethoscope on your bedroom door.

426
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,616
爸爸!
Daddy!

427
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,478
-我们得带她去看医生-她没病，她疯了
- We've got to get her to a doctor. - She's not sick, she's crazy.

428
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,271
——亚瑟……-现在的孩子都很疯狂!
- Arthur... - Kids nowadays are crazy!

429
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,146
难道你不明白吗?如果她没病，就不会发生这种事。
Don't you understand? If she weren't sick, this couldn't happen.

430
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,773
这是不可能发生的。
It just couldn't happen.

431
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,104
我得睡一会儿。
I gotta get some sleep.

432
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:06,450
千变万化的风，呼唤着我的名字，向我招手，“来吧”
J winds of change, they call my name j and beckon, "come"

433
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:10,962
就像飞蛾扑火一样
j just like a moth to a flame

434
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:23,725
春天的孩子，圣经带给你的一切，不要折断锁链中的一环
j child of spring j the scriptures bring you everything j don't break the link in the chain

435
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:33,227
神奇轮在哪里?
j and wherein lies the wonderwheel?

436
00:34:35,282 --> 00:35:10,768
>我们都被安排好如何感受j哦，妈妈j你不要等我不，妈妈j不要试着跟着我j不，妈妈j我要去看世界j

437
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,045
_elliot吗?
_elliot?

438
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,086
嘿,是我。
Hey, it's me.

439
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,426
我不会跟他们回去的，永远不会。
I'm not going back with them, ever.

440
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,183
是的。
Yeah.

441
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:57,310
嘿…你嗑药了?
Hey... You stoned?

442
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,156
——什么?——嗯?
- On what? - Hmm?

443
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,780
什么?
What?

444
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,662
来吧。
Come on.

445
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,081
来吧。
Come on.

446
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:53,869
昨天，吹笛人吹着琴声把我抱起，我明白他拉着我的手，划出一条穿过林间空地的路，神奇的轮子在哪里?＆
J yesterday, the Piper played > and lifted me j a simple child of the shade j little man, I understand j he took my hand & and marked a path through the glade j &' and wherein lies the wonderwheel? &

447

448
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,664
阿迪会知道她在哪的。
Artie'll know where she is.

449
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,561
你看看这个!
Will you look at this!

450
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,980
他知道这个地方，他知道。他直接来了。
He knows this place, knows it. He came straight here.

451
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,857
我该去哪里?
Where do I go?

452
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,775
-我带你去。-不，告诉我
- I'll show you. - No, just tell me.

453

- Second floor, last door on the right. - Arthur.

454
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,365
亲爱的,在这里。我不想让你看到这个。
Darling, stay here. I don't want you to see this.

455
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,783
亚瑟,小心些而已。
Arthur, be careful.

456
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,827
——几楼?——第二。
- What floor? - Second.

457
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,581
和你妈妈待在一起。
Stay with your mother.

458
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,126
你给我滚，莱尼!滚出去!
You get outta here, Lenny! Get out!

459
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,803
滚出去!
Get out!

460
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:08,460
你是红十字会的吗，伙计?
Hey, you from the red cross, man?

461
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,508
我们已经给了。
We gave already.

462
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,713
马克西在哪儿?
Where's maxie?

463
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,048
马克西吗?
Maxie?

464
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,926
我不认识马克西。
I don't know no maxie.

465
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,387
你很了解她。她经常来这里。
You know her all right. She comes here all the time.

466
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,642
她也是未成年人。
She's a minor, too.

467
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,392
所以你最好告诉我她在哪里，而且动作要快，否则你会进监狱的。
So, you better tell me where she is, and do it fast, or you're gonna end up in jail.

468
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,194
嘿，我没见过任何人，好吗?
Hey, I ain't seen nobody, okay?

469
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,737
我会回来，还有警察!

你这个愚蠢的疯子!
You stupid, freaked-out head!

472
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:46,960
为什么,你……离我远点。

473
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,375
离我远点。
Keep away from me.

474
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,886
怎么了，爸爸?
What's the matter, daddy?

475
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,672
嗯,你害怕吗?
You scared, huh?

476
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,678
嗯?你很害怕，是吗?不是吗? !
Huh? You're scared, aren't you? Aren't you?!

477
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,310
爸爸怕了。

看他!
Look at him!

480
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,549
我会再跑掉的，越快越好。
I'll run away again, just as soon as I can.

481
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,113
梅森先生?是的。劳伦博士吗?
Mr Mason? Yes. Dr Lauren?

482
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,690
是的,请进。坐下来。
Yeah, come in. Sit down.

483
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,868
呃…卡罗尔，你想给梅森先生留杯咖啡吗?
Er... Carol, you want to leave a coffee for mr Mason?

484
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:57,660
不,谢谢。
No, thanks.

485
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,362
哦，没关系。我可以再买一些。
Oh, it's all right. I can get some more.

486
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,073
-不，真的，谢谢。——好的。再见。
- No, really, thank you. - Okay. Bye-bye.

487
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,416
坐下来。
Sit down.

488
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:14,385
根据你在电话里跟我说的，我应该直接跟孩子的父亲谈谈。
Well, from what you told me about this boy on the phone, I should talk directly to the father.

489
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,220
哦，那是不可能的。
Oh, that'll never happen.

490
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,922
相信我，我认识这个人。
Believe me, I know this guy.

491
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:22,134
不，我是在想，通过和你谈话，我能更好地知道该怎么跟他说。
No, I was thinking that, by talking to you, I'll get a better idea of what to tell him.

492
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,437
你知道，一些明智的建议。
You know, some sensible advice.

493
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,185
跟我说说这个人。
Tell me about this guy.

494
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,852
——父亲吗?-是的。
- The father? - Yeah.

495
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,653
哦,他是,呃…我猜他只是个普通人。
Oh, he's, er... I guess he's just your average Joe.

496
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,526
也许比这还多。你知道的。
Maybe a cut above. You know the type.

497
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:39,740
他工作努力，喜欢打架，喝得有点多，诸如此类。
He works hard, he likes the fights, he drinks a little too much, that... that kinda thing.

498
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,500
我觉得他是个…他是个很好的父亲。
I get the impression he's a... He's a pretty good father.

499
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:50,546
-至少他在努力。-男孩不喜欢他父母的哪一点?
- At least he tries to be. - What doesn't the boy like about his parents?

500
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:55,168
嗯，他们和他谈了谈，然后，呃……他们发现他……他很敌对。
Well, they had a talk with him, and, er... They found that he's, er... He's pretty hostile.

501
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,759
-他叫他们骗子，笨蛋…——是吗?
- He calls 'em phonies, stupid... - Are they?

502
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:04,432
不,……不是为了我的钱。不比别人多。
No, not... Not for my money. Not any more than anybody else.

503
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:14,112
至少他们在试着去理解，去改善关系，这可比那个男孩做的多得多。我的意思是……你潜水过吗?
At least they're trying to understand, to... To improve the relationship, which is a hell of a lot more than that boy is doing. I mean... You ever been skin diving?

504
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,447
潜水?-是的。
- Skin diving? - Yeah.

505
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,276
我是说，我从没想过我会和鱼交流，直到我去潜水。
I mean, I never thought I'd communicate with a fish until I went scuba diving.

506
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:27,659
你站在一个鱼缸前，盯着这条愚蠢的小鱼，它们也盯着你，然后……什么都没有。
You stand in front of one of those fish tanks, stare in at this dumb little fish, and they stare back at you, and... Nothing.

507
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:37,339
然后你进入他们的世界，在他们的世界里游来游去，他们会跟你玩捉人游戏，他们会取笑你，好像在对你咧嘴笑……他们交流。
And then you go down into their world, swim around, hell, they'll play tag with you, they'll tease you, seem to grin at you... They communicate.

508
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,509
有时间应该试试。
Oughta try it sometime.

509
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:53,192
现在…这个男孩到底做了什么让你和他的父母，这么生气?——不是我。我…我没有心烦意乱。
Now... What specifically did this boy do that got you, and his parents, - so upset? - Not me. I... I wasn't upset.

510
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,506
——而不是个人。——我明白了。
- Not personally. - I understand.

511
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,363
毕竟，他是他们的孩子。“……他做了什么?
After all, he's their kid. “What... what did he do?

512
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,608
他在家里吃了迷幻药。
Well, he took some LSD, right in the home.

513
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:05,412
——嗯。-他得了那种病，呃……——旅行。游手好闲的人。-对，就是这样。
- Mm-hmm. - He had one of those bad, er... - Trips. Bummer. - Yeah, that's it.

514
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:14,797
然后,这……他从家里跑了出来，他的父母在东村一路找到了他，他身上装着毒品，躺在床上。和一个最丑的女孩在一起…
Then, this... he ran away from home and his parents found him all the way down in the east village loaded with drugs and in bed with a... With a girl, one of the ugliest...

515
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,261
父母做了什么?
What did the parents do?

516
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,134
他们把他带回家。
They took him home.

517
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,216
还有什么?
What else?

518
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,893
就是这样。他们不知道该怎么办。
That's it. They don't know what to do.

519
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,555
-好的，我有一些建议给你。——太棒了。
- Okay, I've got some advice for you. - Great.

520
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,062
跑,不要走。
Run, don't walk.

521
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,771
家庭治疗。
Family therapy.

522
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,603
你是说送她去看心理医生吗?
You mean, send her to a psychoanalyst?

523
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,188
“她”?
"Her"?

524
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,114
我说“她”了吗?
Did I say "her"?

525
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,284
不,我的意思是……我的意思是“他”。
No, I meant... l meant "him".

526
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,701
但不要派他去。带他。
But don't send him. Take him.

527
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,911
家庭治疗。
Family therapy.

528
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,454
-父母也是吗?-最重要的是父母。
- The parents, too? - Parents, most of all.

529
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,041
哦,他会…他不会那样做的。
Oh, he'll... He'll never do that.

530
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,172
那你去和他谈谈。
Well, you talk to him.

531
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,137
不，我认识他。他不是那种类型的人。
No, I know him. He's not the type.

532
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,179
你……你要说服他。
You... you fry to convince him.

533
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:33,626
今天似乎没有人很健谈。
Nobody... Seems very talkative today.

534
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:39,027
坦白地说，医生，我觉得我们在这些会议上没什么进展。
Frankly, doctor, I don't think we were getting much done here in these sessions.

535
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,837
有多少人?四个吗?五个?
How many of 'em? Four? Five?

536
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,128
我只听说我是个大骗子。
All I've heard is what a big phoney I am.

537
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,054
好吧，也许我是。就我个人而言，我不认为我是。
All right, maybe I am. Personally, I don't think I am.

538
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,592
但是，如果我女儿想告诉我，就让她免费告诉我。
But, if my daughter wants to tell me that, let her tell me for free.

539
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,560
没有个人,医生。
Nothing personal, doc.

540
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,262
你觉得怎么样，马克西?
What do you say to that, maxie?

541
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,222
我…我…我不知道。
I... I... I don't know.

542
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,608
你一定有一些想法。
You must have some thoughts about it.

543
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,143
不是真的。
Not really.

544
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,354
你呢，gerrie?
How about you, gerrie?

545
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:10,659
嗯，我知道这很贵，但在我看来，她和我们一起来这里，坐在这里是很重要的。
Well, I... I know it is expensive, but it seems to me that just the fact that she's coming here with us, and... and... and sitting here is important.

546
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,532
我有选择的余地吗?
Do I have a choice?

547
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,913
马克西，能帮我个忙吗?
Maxie, would you do me a favour?

548
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,004
也许吧。
Maybe.

549
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:21,044
你每次来这里都戴着墨镜和围巾，所以我几乎看不见你。
Every time you come here, you wear those dark glasses and that scarf, so I can hardly see you.

550
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,421
我被动地疏远了。
I'm passively alienated.

551
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,754
她记住了这些该死的短语，然后就迫不及待地要用它们。
She memorises these damn phrases and then just can't wait to use 'em.

552
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,555
你是个漂亮的女孩。
You're a pretty girl.

553
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,885
我们谈话的时候能看见你会更好。
It would be nice to see you while we talk.

554
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,392
好多了。谢谢你！
Much better. Thank you.

555
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,195
马克西，你为什么觉得你爸爸是个骗子?
Maxie, why do you think your dad is a phoney?

556
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,910
首先，他是个追尾者。
Well, for one thing, he's a tail-chaser.

557
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,119
你想再解释一下吗?
Do you care to amplify that?

558
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,292
我见过他和一个女人在一起好几次。
I've seen him with a woman several times.

559
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,498
也许亚瑟有个解释。
Maybe Arthur has an explanation.

560
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,625
我早就知道了。
I've known for a long time.

561
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:04,668
-有证据吗?——不,我…我只是知道，仅此而已。
- By any evidence? - No, I... I just knew, that's all.

562
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,423
女人总是知道的。
Women always know.

563
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,254
有时你错了。
Sometimes you're wrong.

564
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:12,717
当我们怀疑的时候，我们可能是错的，但当我们知道的时候，我们总是对的。
Oh, when we suspect it, we can be wrong, but when we know it, then we're always right.

565
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,222
不总是正确的。
Not always.

566
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,762
总是这样。
Always.

567
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:23,353
我们是否承认这一点是另一个问题，但是……我承认了，我决定接受现实。
Whether we admit it to ourselves or not is another question, but... I did admit it, and I decided to live with it.

568
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,151
但是马克西不能。是吗，马克西?
But maxie couldn't. Is that right, maxie?

569
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,732
我才不管他做什么。
I couldn't care less what he does.

570
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,943
那是他的事。让他去做吧。
That's his thing. Let him do it.

571
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:34,784
就像受苦是她的事，窥探别人的事是你的事。
Just like suffering is her thing, and pryin' into other people's business is yours.

572
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,501
那为什么我不能在不被窃听的情况下做我自己的事呢?
So why can't I do mine without being bugged all the time about it?

573
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,041
你父亲在哭，马克西。
Your father's crying, maxie.

574
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,466
你怎么看?
What do you think about that?

575
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,759
嗯。
Hmm.

576
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,053
我不认为他能。
I didn't think he could.

577
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:57,061
现在,看…关于今天下午。我。
Now, look... Look, about this afternoon. I.

578
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,943
- Gerrie，我想说一件事-你什么都不用说。
- Gerrie, I'd like to say one thing. - You don't have to say anything.

579
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,361
该死，我知道。
Damn it, yes, I do.

580
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,190
你想哭就哭吧。-我不会哭的。
- You can cry if you want to. - I'm not going to cry.

581
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,490
好吧，随你的便。
Well, whatever you feel like.

582
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,410
你一定知道这不是你做了或没做的事。
You must know that it wasn't anything you did or didn't do.

583
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:20,910
-拜托，别说了。-嗯，…这只是我的一个弱点，某种该死的无用的特质……格里，没人靠近过。
- Please, stop it. - Well, it was... It was just a weakness on my part, some kind of a damned no-good streak of... Gerrie, nobody ever got close.

584
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,462
这不是亲密关系之类的。
It was no closeness or anything like that.

585
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,212
这显然是动物不负责任的本能。
It was plain, irresponsible animal instincts.

586
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:32,217
还有一件事，我一直觉得…不,两件事。
And one other thing, I always felt... no, two things.

587
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:38,177
我每次都感到羞愧，现在也是。……这是一件事。
I always felt ashamed every time, and I'm ashamed now. That's... that's one thing.

588
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,354
另一件事是……
And the other thing is...

589
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,782
另一件事是，我再也不会这么做了。
The other thing is, I'll never do it again.

590
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,406
我抽烟太多了。
I smoke too much.

591
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:08,006
我才不管清单上写了什么，你…——亚瑟。-我很急，黛拉
I don't give a damn what the inventory says, you... - Arthur. - I'm in a big hurry, della.

592
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,135
亚瑟!
Arthur!

593
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:21,224
然后，把它们拿出来，把温度提高到380,480度，接近500华氏度。
And then, to lift them out, raise the heat about 380, 480, nearly up to 500 degrees fahrenheit.

594
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,180
你一整天都表现得很奇怪。
You've been acting funny all day.

595
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,187
黛拉，我要去马戈林医生的办公室。
Della, I'm due at dr margolin's office.

596
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:31,614
阿特，去三号仓库，看看我们手头有多少个0.75吨的货。
Art, go check warehouse three, see how many three-quarter-ton units we have on hand.

597
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,237
我现在有四辆卡车在等这批货。
I've got four trucks waiting for this shipment right now.

598
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,364
你生我的气了吗?
Are you mad at me about something?

599
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,282
黛拉，格里知道我们的事了。
Della, gerrie knows about us.

600
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:50,462
听着，我不是要解雇你。我还是希望你在这里工作，但其他的…你最好别把我当纸巾来对待，亚瑟。
Look, now, I'm not firing you. I still want you to work here, but the rest of it... Better not try to treat me like an old kleenex, Arthur.

601
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,385
我…我现在不能跟你谈，黛拉。
I... I can't talk to you now, della.

602
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,180
回答它,混蛋。
Answer it, bastard.

603
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,970
看看他们都多大了。
Well, just look how old they are.

604
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,898
我是说，你想和这么老的人在一起吗?
I mean, how would you like to have folks that old, huh?

605
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,516
我只是讨厌他们，仅此而已。
I just hate 'em, that's all.

606
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,645
我是说，像他们这样的两个老人生孩子太蠢了。
I mean, it's dumb for two old people like them to have a baby.

607
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,196
他们要孩子干什么?
What would they wanna have a baby for?

608
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:19,904
我的意思是，我母亲45岁，我父亲60岁，看看他们得到了什么。我!
I mean, my mother was forty-five years old, and my father was sixty, and look what they got. Me!

609
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,997
看看我的样子。
Look how I look.

610
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,042
为什么你在生孩子之前就不能想到孩子呢?
Why couldn't you think of the kid before you started havin' a kid?

611
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,916
为什么他们就不能说"好吧，好吧" "我们太老了，不能生孩子了"
Why couldn't they just say, "okay, okay, "we're too old to have a baby"?

612
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:34,301
但是我的父亲。他得去证明他能有孩子。这一切都是为了他自己。
But my father. He's gotta go and prove he can have a kid. All for his own ego.

613
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,717
他们两个我都讨厌，我真希望他们死掉。
Well, I hate both of 'em. I wish they would just die.

614
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,514
我真希望我死了。
I wish I would die.

615
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:48,103
当我还想从高中毕业的时候，我甚至还没意识到他们那破旧的身体给了我多么愚蠢的大脑。
When I was still tryin' to graduate high school, before I even realised what a dumb brain they'd given me with their old beat-up bodies.

616
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:51,731
我以前很讨厌他们来学校，我尽量避免靠近他们。
I used to hate it when they'd come over to the school and I'd try and avoid being anywhere near them.

617
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,562
抱歉，工作上出了点小问题。
Sorry, little problem on the job.

618
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,524
我告诉每个人他们其实是我的祖父母。
I told everybody they were really my grandparents.

619
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,530
好吧，看看他们!
Well, look at 'em!

620
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,282
看看它们，真恶心!
Look at 'em, they're disgusting!

621
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:05,992
我是说，你想不想当个孩子，试着打棒球，有个八十岁的父亲?
I mean, how would you like to be a kid, tryin' to... tryin' to play baseball, and have a father that's eighty years old?

622
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,202
我恨他。
I hate him.

623
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,125
你知道,我……我恨你。
You know, I... I hate you.

624
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,047
你真是个混蛋!
You are a shit!

625
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,171
你为什么不去别的地方等死呢?
Why don't you just go away someplace, and... and die?

626
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,548
去死吧。
Just die.

627
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:24,761
嗯…谁对沃利的声明有何评论?
Well... Who has a comment on Wally's statement?

628
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:31,859
没有人吗?
Nobody?

629
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,778
肯定有人有话要说吧?
Well, surely somebody has something to say?

630
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,942
是的,我有。
Yes, I do.

631
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,973
-你没有权利…-我不想再听你说了。
- You've got no right... - I don't wanna listen to you again.

632
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:47,332
-你坐在那里和…-你知道，他对每件事都有评论，但他什么都不知道。
- You sit there and talk to... - You know, he's got a comment on everything, and he doesn't know anything about anything.

633
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:52,295
——但是,做……-但他刚告诉我…马克西，你有什么要说的吗?
- But, do... - But he's just told me... Do you have a comment, maxie?

634
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,623
是的,我有。
Yes, I do.

635
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,504
你不介意吧?女士优先?
You don't mind, do you? Ladies first?

636
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,880
来吧,马克西。
Go ahead, maxie.

637
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:02,722
首先，这些恶心的东西我看得越多，我就越不知道我为什么在这里。
Well, first of all, the more I come to these gross things, the less I know why I'm here.

638
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,847
我是说，这些会议真的很恶心。
I mean, these meetings are really gross.

639
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:10,473
这些小组会议有时可能会有点恶心。
Well, these group sessions might get a bit gross sometimes.

640
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:20,816
这个,呃……这个人在这里，这个…这个叫沃利的家伙，他只是在浪费我们的时间。他是个疯子。
This, um... This person over here, this... This Wally guy, he just wastes our time. He's a nut.

641
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:24,403
这个可爱的大宝贝呢?
What about this sweet big baby?

642
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,322
在各个领域都是权威。
Big authority on every subject.

643
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,578
他真让我恶心。
Well, he makes me sick.

644
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,159
你们都让我恶心。
You all make me sick.

645
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,162
如果我有一些酸，…我就在此时此地把它扔了。
If I had some acid, I'd... I'd drop it right here, right now.

646
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,122
——“放弃”?-意思是“接受”。
- "Drop it"? - It means "take it".

647
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:42,137
你明白我的意思吗?嗯…我不想再回到这里了。
D'you see what I mean? Well... I don't wanna come back here anymore.

648
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,057
-你想干什么，马克西?——出来。我要出去了。
- What do you want, maxie? - Out. I want out.

649
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,217
你是说我们的世界?
Of our world, you mean?

650
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,271
是的，我会找到新的现实。
Yes, I'm gonna find a new reality.

651
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,689
——用药物。——是的。
- With drugs. - Yup.

652
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,267
但是让我们想一下。
But let's think about this a moment.

653
00:51:55,362 --> 00:52:02,650
不是逃离现实世界，逃离现实……这难道不是一种死亡吗?
Isn't running away from the world as it is, away from reality... Isn't that a kind of death?

654
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,115
死亡有什么不好?
Well, what's so bad about death?

655
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,617
这能帮我们摆脱困境。
It'd get us out of this.

656
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,765
你好,马克西。你好吗?
Hello, maxie. How are you?

657
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,355
看。
Watch it.

658
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,782
谢谢你！原谅我。
Thank you. Excuse me.

659
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,993
你喜欢吗?
D'you like that?

660
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,173
嘿，这是新的吗?
Hey, is this new?

661
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,509
-你从哪儿弄来的?-我买了。
- Where'd you get it? - I bought it.

662
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,780
不!你知道我不能喝酒。
No! You know I can't drink.

663
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,903
别这样，这是庆祝，亲爱的。
Come on, it's a celebration, sweetheart.

664
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,947
看看她，和一个理发的男孩跳舞。
Look at her, dancing with a boy with a haircut.

665
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,702
一个喜欢上学的男孩。
A boy who likes school.

666
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,585
她需要的只是健康的家庭娱乐。
All she needed was a little wholesome family fun.

667
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,458
加油！加油
Come on, come on.

668
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,877
亚瑟!
Arthur!

669
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,296
——亚瑟……亚瑟!-不，我们走。
- Arthur... Arthur! - No, let's go.

670
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,711
漂亮!
Beautiful!

671
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,248
我整晚都是怎么做到的?
How did I ever do that all night long?

672
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,167
你在抽什么?
What's that you're smoking?

673
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,635
草,男人。
Grass, man.

674
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,762
-你想来点吗?-你在开玩笑吗?
- You want some? - Are you kiddin"?

675
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,840
让我看看。
Let me see that.

676
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,348
嘿，嘿，怎么了?我做了什么?
Hey, hey, what's the matter? What did I do?

677
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,229
发生什么事了?
What's... what's goin' on?

678
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,353
嘿,阻止他!
Hey, stop him!

679
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,197
-住手!-在我家里抽大麻!
- Break it up! - Smokin' pot in my house!

680
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,324
你对吧?是的。
You all right? Yes.

681
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,329
他只是有点，呃……加载,仅此而已。
He's just a little, er... Loaded, that's all.

682
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,961
我很抱歉。我很抱歉。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

683
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,551
你不该这么刻薄，亚瑟。
You shouldn't have been so mean, Arthur.

684
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,843
也许我们都应该试试。
Well, maybe we all oughta try it.

685
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,204
我听说它不会让你宿醉，不像马提尼酒。
I hear it doesn't give you a hangover, the way Martinis do.

686
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,014
你是美丽的,蒂娜。
You're beautiful, Tina.

687
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,517
-我们应该考虑走了。——为什么?它的早期。
- We should think about going. - Why? It's early.

688
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,722
来吧，我们走。
Come on, let's go.

689
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:02,977
-我伤到你了吗?——不,男人。
- Did I hurt you? - No, man.

690
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,605
我希望不是这样。晚安，晚安。
I hope not. Good night, good night.

691
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,340
我们得说晚安了，亚瑟。
Well, we'll have to say good night, Arthur.

692
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,446
-是啊，我娶了个扫兴的人。-晚安，大卫。
- Yeah, I married a wet blanket. - Good night, David.

693
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,398
——谢谢,亚瑟。-那是什么，扫兴的人?
- Thanks, Arthur. - What's that, killjoy?

694
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,279
哦!轮胎链。
Oh! Tyre chains.

695
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,578
桑迪，桑迪，过来谢谢梅森先生给你的轮胎链。
Sandy, Sandy, come thank mr Mason for your tyre chains.

696
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,496
——哦,哇!-我该付你多少钱?
- Oh, wow! - Oh, how much do I owe you?

697
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,619
——忘记它。——不,不。
- Forget it. - No, no.

698
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,271
我真的很感激你，梅森先生。
Hey, I really appreciate these, mr Mason.

699
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,189
来，把钥匙给我。我把它们放在你的行李箱里。
Here, let me have your keys. I'll put 'em in your trunk for you.

700
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,607
别傻了，妈妈，我来。
Oh, don't be silly, mom, I'll do it.

701
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,337
不,不,不。你待在这里玩得开心。
No, no, no. You stay here and have fun.

702
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,425
——没有。——是的,先生。
- No. - Yes, sir.

703
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,716
你都还没喝呢。
You haven't even had your drink yet.

704
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:33,007
他觉得如果他今晚不喝酒，也许我会让他…再见!
He thinks if he doesn't drink his drink tonight, maybe I'll let him have... bye!

705
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,409
也许我明天会让他吃两个。
Maybe I'll let him have two tomorrow.

706
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,433
说实话，妈妈，我真的不想要。
To tell you the truth, mom, I really don't want it.

707
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,133
现在,卑鄙,卑鄙。
Now, sneaky, sneaky.

708
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,764
把钥匙给我。
Let me have your keys.

709
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:43,063
可能是和某个女孩走了，然后被困在雪地里。
Probably go off with some girl, and get stuck in the snow.

710
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,814
你会相信那个男孩吗?
Huh, would you believe that boy?

711
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,442
他总有一天会娶那辆车。
He's gonna marry that car someday.

712
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:59,447
他想娶什么就娶什么。
Oh, well, he can marry anything he wants.

713
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,749
只要他在院长的名单上，我们就不在乎，对吧，亲亲?
As long as he's on the Dean's list, we don't care, do we, smoochie?

714
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,593
你好,在那里。
Hi, there.

715
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:40,495
老家伙麻烦，我不需要你J我只想你离我的门远点J只要你离我的门远点J现在，我有节奏J我有音乐J我有我的女人
J old man trouble, I don't need you j I just want you to stay away from my door j just you stay away from my door j now, I got rhythm j I got music j I've got my gal

716
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:46,122
谁能要求更多?她玩得很开心，亲爱的。她有一个真正的老式舞会。
j who could ask for anything more? J she had a ball, sweetheart. She had a real old-fashioned ball.

717
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,044
你也一样。
And so did you.

718
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,416
马克西!
Maxie!

719
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,629
马克西!
Maxie!

720
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,051
马克西!
Maxie!

721
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,519
哦,马克西。
Oh, maxie.

722
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,752
在我看来，你女儿受了很大的伤害。
In my judgement, your daughter has taken a large dose of stp.

723
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,675
Stp吗?那不是很危险的那个吗?
Stp? Isn't that the one that's so dangerous?

724
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,970
-亲爱的…-是的，可以。
- Sweetheart... - It can be, yes.

725
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,797
我们没有解毒剂。
We have no antidote for stp.

726
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:25,843
我们可以试着让那个人安静下来，等它消失。
We can just try to keep the person quiet and wait till it wears off.

727
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,396
我建议你回家休息一下。
I suggest you go home and try to get some rest.

728
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:36,068
医生……十点钟回来。
Doctor... Come back at ten o'clock.

729
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,817
是的,但是……
Yes, but...

730
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:01,423
你觉得桑迪为什么不让我拿他的车钥匙?
Why do you suppose Sandy wouldn't let me have the keys to his car?

731
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,017
大卫吗?
David?

732
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,761
蒂娜，看在上帝的份上!
Tina, for Pete's sake!

733
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,769
那些减肥药让你变得完全古怪。
Those diet pills are making you downright kooky.

734
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,601
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

735
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,778
你喝得够多的了，现在看看你。
You had enough to drink to put a horse to sleep, and now look at ya.

736
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,529
我没办法。
I can't help it.

737
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,063
你拿这个干什么?
What are you doing with this?

738
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,606
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

739
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,392
我卖它。
I'm selling it.

740
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,038
大卫……
David...

741
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:37,826
现在,看看。
Now, look.

742
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,832
孩子们在吃这些东西。
The kids are taking this stuff.

743
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,380
我是说，不是我，而是很多其他人。
I mean, not me, but a lot of the others.

744
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,798
马克西从你那拿到的。
Maxie got it from you.

745
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,613
他们总得从别人那里买，对吧?
Well, they gotta buy it from somebody, right?

746
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,502
那么，为什么不是我呢?
So, why not me?

747
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:53,850
再说，你认为我能用你给我的那点可怜的零用钱买校服吗?
Besides, do you think I can get along and buy school clothes on that lousy little allowance you give me?

748
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:57,896
那可怜的零用钱是你父亲的命根子。
That lousy little allowance is your father's life blood.

749
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,769
你从节俭和储蓄中得到乐趣。
You get a kick outta scrimping and saving.

750
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,224
你总是。
You always have.

751
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:05,104
那你要我怎么去买汽油，在周末来回跑?
And how do you expect me to buy gas, to get back and forth on the weekends?

752
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,530
这很简单。这没什么。
And this is easy. There's nothing to it.

753
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,107
直到你被捕。
Till you get arrested.

754
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,027
不，警察几乎睁一只眼闭一只眼。
No, the cops almost look the other way.

755
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,864
……太多了，他们很尴尬。
There's... there's so much of it, they're embarrassed.

756
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:19,076
如果他们想把所有的草头都抓起来，他们就会把自己的孩子送进监狱。
If they tried to bust all the grass-heads, they'd be putting their own kids in jail.

757
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,749
你不怕我们逮捕你吗?
Aren't you afraid that we might have you arrested?

758
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,171
我了解你，爸爸。
I know you, pop.

759
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,044
我是你的宠儿。
I'm your fair-haired boy.

760
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:30,925
这是你人生中最大的乐趣，告诉所有人我有多棒，我有一天会成为一名大律师。
That's the biggest kick you have in life, telling everybody how great I am, how I'm gonna be a big lawyer someday.

761
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,926
你是对的。我是。
And you're right. I am.

762
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:35,100
你不会搞砸的。任何东西。
You wouldn't bust that up. Not for anything.

763
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,471
你接受不了。
You couldn't take it.

764
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,937
所以，在某种程度上，这是……我很幸运，你发现了。
So, in a way, it's, er... lucky for me that you found out.

765
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:45,268
因为，既然你知道了，你就算是同谋了。
Because, now that you know, you'd be sort of... Accomplices.

766
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,564
我可以把东西放在家里。
And I can keep the stuff right here in the house.

767
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,621
总之，我讨厌偷偷摸摸。
I... I hate sneaking, anyhow.

768
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,108
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

769
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,110
哦,哇。
Oh, wow.

770
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,986
我真的害怕。你这么激动，我是说。
I really am. That you're so shook up, I mean.

771
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,755
不,大卫。不是警察。不是现在。
No, David. Not the police. Not now.

772
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,553
我们得有时间思考。
We have to have time to think.

773
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,884
总得有人从某个地方开始。
Somebody has to start somewhere.

774
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,558
-东三街178号-东第七街158号。
- 178 east 3rd street. - 158 east 7th street.

775
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,441
你这样浪费时间真是太可惜了。
It's a shame for you to be wasting your time like this.

776
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,739
那个警官刚刚侵犯了我的权利。
That officer just violated my rights.

777
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,821
他们会马上放我走的。
They'll let me go immediately.

778
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:22,457
作为一个公民，我觉得你可以更好地利用你的时间——努力抓住罪犯。——走吧。我们走吧。
As a citizen, I feel you could make better use of your time - trying to catch criminals. - Let's go. Let's go.

779
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,461
他们真的有必要派你们四个人去吗?
Did they really have to send four of you guys?

780
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,637
我们已经派人去请了一位同伴来陪她。
We've sent for a peer to come sit with her.

781
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,981
——一个同伴吗?-是的，同辈，平等的人。
- A peer? - Yes, a peer, an equal.

782
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,523
某人,呃…他们觉得自己值得信任。
Someone, er... they feel they can trust.

783
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,108
你可以这么说，不是当权派的人。
Someone not of the establishment, if you will.

784
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:01,075
正如我们所说，这个同伴帮助我们说服他们。
And this peer helps us by talking them down, as we say.

785
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,962
这就是所谓的精神病院，不是吗?
This is what they call a psycho ward, isn't it?

786
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,791
是的，一个不幸的名字。
Yes, an unfortunate name.

787
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:25,391
同样不幸的是，由于空间和人员的原因，我们不得不把像你女儿这样的小女孩和吸毒成瘾的人，所有能想到的都放在同一个病房里。
It's also unfortunate that, for space and personnel reasons, we have to put a young girl like your daughter in the same ward with... Dt cases, heroin addicts who have oded, everything imaginable.

788
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,892
哦，就一句警告。
Oh, just one word of warning.

789
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,100
她看到你在这里可能会有不良反应。
She may have an adverse reaction to seeing you here.

790
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,714
也许我们不该进去。
Well, maybe we shouldn't go in.

791
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:36,071
不，不，我想看看她的反应，但如果她见你不高兴你也别难过。
No, no, I'd like to see her reaction, but don't be upset if she doesn't seem glad to see you.

792
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:37,532
嗯?
Huh?

793
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:41,115
早上好。
Good morning.

794
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,630
——你好,医生。——早上,詹妮弗。
- Hi, doctor. - Morning, Jennifer.

795
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,630
我想问一件事。
I wanted to ask one thing.

796
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:04,847
我们能不能试着跟她谈谈，告诉她我们错了什么?
Would it be all right if we tried to talk to her, and tell her we were wrong about something?

797
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,553
对不起,我的意思是。
Apologise, I mean.

798
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,354
你觉得这样可以吗?
Do you think it would be all right?

799
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,806
尽管试试吧。
Try it, by all means.

800
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,608
如果她愿意接受，可能会有很大帮助。
If she's receptive, it could be a big help.

801
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:35,168
哒哒哒哒哒哒dum哒哒哒dum哒哒哒dum哒哒哒dum哒哒哒dum哒哒哒dum哒哒哒j -马克西?
J la da da Dee da Dee dum j la da da Dee da Dee dum j la da da Dee da Dee dum j dum, Dee da da dum j la da da Dee da Dee dum j la da da Dee da Dee dum y Dee dum... j - maxie?

802
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,636
马克西。
Maxie.

803
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:51,056
马克西,我们……我们发现了桑迪的事。
Maxie, we... We found out about Sandy.

804
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:54,566
他向他的父母承认了这一点。
He admitted it to his mother and father.

805
01:07:55,530 --> 01:08:00,323
我们为指控你哥哥而道歉。
We want to apologise for... For accusing your brother.

806
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:03,114
我们知道你有多爱他…
We know how much you love him...

807
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,211
亚瑟!
Arthur!

808
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:24,009
萨拉查医生!拿钥匙!
Get dr Salazar! Get the key!

809
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,467
——他来了。-把我弄出去!让我出去!
- He's coming. - Get me out! Get me out!

810
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,814
嘿,妈妈。阿蒂!
Hey, mom. Artie!

811
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,142
我得离开这里。
I've gotta get out of here.

812
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:49,163
我听说她情绪失控了。
I heard she flipped out pretty bad.

813
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,411
那么你是，呃…Whatchamacallit吧?
So you're the, er... Whatchamacallit, huh?

814
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,787
…同行吗?
The... the peer?

815
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,165
他们说她要见我。
They said she asked for me.

816
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:58,339
我对你犯了个严重的错误，阿迪。
I made a pretty bad mistake about you, Artie.

817
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,836
这就是生活。
That's life.

818
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,672
帮助她康复。
Help her get better.

819
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,716
我试试看。
I'll try.

820
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,016
医生。
Doctor.

821
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,032
马克西。
Maxie.

822
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,985
马克西。
Maxie.

823
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,556
我会给你做一顿让你永生难忘的晚餐。
I'm gonna fix you a dinner you won't soon forget.

824
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,053
我可以做晚饭。
I can fix dinner.

825
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:35,262
你呆在床上。完整的休息。
You stay in that bed. Complete rest.

826
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,816
你知道，我是个不错的厨师。
I'm not a bad cook, you know.

827
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,777
我不是。
I'm not.

828
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,444
是的,你是。
Yes, you are.

829
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:09,804
-拜托，马克西。-你能做到的。
- Come on, maxie. - You can do it.

830
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,301
来吧。
Come on.

831
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,475
来吧,现在。
Come on, now.

832
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,473
马克西吗?
Maxie?

833
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,485
好吧，现在你试试。
Okay, now you try it.

834
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,119
来吧。
Come on.

835
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:09,113
天啊，医生，这活儿真辛苦。
Jesus, doc, that's rough work.

836
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,789
我很快就会回来的，妹妹。
I'll be back again soon, sis.

837
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:51,941
你哥哥说帮你的工作很辛苦，你确实是，你知道吗?
Your brother says you are rough work, and you are, you know?

838
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,528
呵呀!
Ach!

839
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,951
也许我们应该带你出去转转。
Maybe we should walk you around outside for a while.

840
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,626
那是一个美丽的…
It's a beautiful...

841
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,566
你喜欢它吗?
You like it?

842
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,526
是的，非常好。
Yes, it's very nice.

843
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,615
诚实和真正的吗?
Honest and truly?

844
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,038
诚实的。
Honest.

845
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,545
这是你的。
It's yours.

846
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,375
这些也可以给你。我讨厌他们。
You can have these, too. I hate 'em.

847
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,795
你恨他们吗?
You hate 'em?

848
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,596
恨他们，恨他们，恨他们。
Hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em.

849
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,804
如果你恨他们，为什么要恨他们?
Well, if you hate 'em, why do 'em?

850
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,354
为了取悦萨拉查医生。
To please dr Salazar.

851
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,775
如果我愿意，萨拉查医生会放我出去的。
If I please dr Salazar, he'll let me out of here.

852
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,602
那太好了，宝贝。
Oh, that'll be wonderful, baby.

853
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,733
也许能赶上你的生日?
Maybe in time for your birthday?

854
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,657
我们都很想让你和我们一起回家。
We both want you back home with us so much.

855
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,944
哦，是吗?
Oh, you do, huh?

856
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,496
你会很开心的，宝贝。
You're gonna be happy, baby.

857
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,617
事情正在回到……好了,再在一起。
Things are getting back to... Well, together again.

858
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:28,544
过去几周，阿迪经常来。
Artie drops by more, a lot more, the last couple of weeks.

859
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,622
-还有你妈妈和我…-她还在床上?
- And your mom and me... - She's still in bed?

860
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,547
——好吧,她是……——她是胆小鬼。
- Well, she's... - She's chicken.

861
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,375
我讨厌胆小鬼。
I hate chicken people.

862
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:39,717
但是…但是…我想回家。我真的。
But... but... I wanna come home. I really do.

863
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:46,429
我是说，如果萨拉查医生认为我不想回家，那他就不会让我出去了。
I mean, if dr Salazar ever thought that I... That I didn't want to come home, why... Why, then he'd never let me out of here.

864
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,854
爸爸……
Daddy...

865
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:57,235
-你喜欢吗?——非常。
- You like this? - Very much.

866
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,487
它和这个是一样的。
It's just the same as this one.

867
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:04,239
爸爸，你觉得它们好吗?
Daddy, do you think they're good?

868
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,158
我的意思是……真的好吗?
I mean... Really good?

869
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,834
嗯，我认为他们很好。
Well, I think they're good.

870
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:13,839
我是说，我不是…我不是艺术评论家，但我…我认为他们展示了天赋，是的。
I mean, I'm not... I'm not an art critic, but I... I think they show talent, yes.

871
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,962
你真的很喜欢撒谎，是吧，爸爸?
You really like to lie a lot, don't you, daddy?

872
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:21,009
我只…知道我为什么不想回家了吧?
I only... See why I don't wanna come home?

873
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,056
谎言,谎言,谎言!
Lies, lies, lies!

874
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,596
爸爸，别告诉萨拉查医生是我说的。
Oh, daddy, don't tell dr Salazar I said that.

875
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,480
求你了，我真的想回家。
Please, please, I do wanna come home.

876
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,854
-别告诉他，爸爸，求你了-我不会。
- Don't tell him, daddy, please. - I won't.

877
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,530
不管怎样，我真的想回家和你和妈妈在一起。
Anyway, really, I do wanna come home and be with you and mom.

878
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,278
那太好了，宝贝。太棒了。
That'd be wonderful, baby. Just wonderful.

879
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:45,325
我愿意，我愿意，我愿意……我愿意。
I do, I do, I do... I do.

880
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,365
我愿意。
I do.

881
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:53,212
爸爸……你为什么要我回家?
Daddy... Why do you want me to come home?

882
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,882
为什么?
Why?

883
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,265
因为我们爱你，这就是原因。
Because we love you, that's why.

884
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:12,644
骗子,骗子。
Liar, liar.

885
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,985
-骗子，骗子，骗子，骗子!-马克西，别这样。
- Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar! - Maxie, please don't.

886
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,072
——我很抱歉。——骗子!
- I'm sorry. - Liar!

887
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,550
-我不是故意惹你生气的。——骗子!
- I didn't mean to get you upset. - Liar!

888
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,905
不,马克西,请!
Don't, maxie, please!

889
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,483
——足够,马克西。——这就够了。
- Enough, maxie. - That's enough.

890
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,952
对不起,我……我下周不能见你了。
I'm sorry, I... I won't be able to see you next week.

891
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:26,779
我要出城了。
I'll be outta town.

892
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,489
但你妈妈可以打电话。
But your mother can call.

893
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,825
-告诉她不用麻烦了。-她不能下床
- Tell her not to bother. - She's not allowed out of bed.

894
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,662
请走开!走开!
Go away, please! Go away!

895
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,873
我将……十天后见，宝贝。
I'll... I'll see you in about ten days, baby.

896
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,471
他让我很紧张。
He just gets me uptight.

897
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,681
我有权利紧张，就像其他人一样。
I have a right to get uptight, just like anybody else.

898
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,442
这并不意味着我有什么问题。
It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with me.

899
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,570
亚瑟，这些事非得在星期天做吗?
Arthur, does this stuff have to be done on a Sunday?

900
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:06,118
当然必须这么做。我告诉你。
'Course it has to be done. I told ya.

901
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,286
我是说，为什么是我?
I mean, why me?

902
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,996
"为什么是我"是什么意思?"
Whaddaya mean, "why me?"

903
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:14,660
这么晚了我还能找谁知道空调的规格?
Who else could I get who knows about air condition specifications at this late date?

904
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,795
没有人,我猜。
Nobody, I guess.

905
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,873
你到底是怎么回事?
What the hell's the matter with you?

906
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,504
你穿成这样是为了什么?
And what are you all dressed up for?

907
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,175
星期天我总是盛装打扮。
I always dress up on Sunday.

908
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:28,595
亚瑟，你真的以为拉弗蒂会同意市政府工作的新规格，结果他告发了你吗?
Arthur, is it really true that you expected Rafferty to okay the new specs on this city job, and he finked out on you?

909
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:31,268
当你了解一个人的时候，你会觉得他们会屈服。
You get to know somebody, you'd think they'd bend a little.

910
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:37,608
如果我不能在明天早上9点的截止日期前完成这些新规格…-他们会取消合同。
And if I don't reach the nine A.M. deadline tomorrow - with these new specs... - They'd cancel the contract.

911
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,276
你会失去什么呢?
And you'd lose?

912
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,820
这是我想过的最重要的工作，黛拉。
This is the biggest job I ever figured, della.

913
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:49,237
根据我的计算，你将损失大约1700美元的开支和大约1万美元的预期利润。
By my calculations, you'll lose about seventeen hundred dollars expenditures and about ten thousand dollars expected profits.

914
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,738
这是正确的。
That's right.

915
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,573
我不干了,亚瑟。
I quit, Arthur.

916
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,749
从现在开始。
As of now.

917
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,591
你在开玩笑!
You're kiddin"!

918
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,719
回头见。
Ta-ta.

919
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,593
黛拉，你不能这么做!
Della, you can't do this!

920
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,053
想打赌吗?
Wanna bet?

921
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,979
在这种时候是不行的。
Not at a time like this.

922
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:20,359
我一直在等待这样的时刻，亚瑟。
A time like this is what I've been waiting for, Arthur.

923
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,544
我们做得怎么样了?
Well, how are we doing?

924
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,832
她不和我说话。
She won't talk to me.

925
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,542
也许下次。
Maybe next time.

926
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,295
再见,医生。
So long, doctor.

927
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:02,484
我想离开这里，我不想跟他们回去。
I want out of here, and I don't wanna go back with them.

928
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,320
我不明白为什么我要等到十八岁。
And I don't see why I have to wait till I'm eighteen.

929
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,023
孩子们知道的比法律制定时多得多。
Kids know a lot more than they used to when that law was made.

930
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:10,609
-关于一些事情。——关于一切。
- About some things. - About everything.

931
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,286
总之，关于重要的事情。
Anyway, about important things.

932
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:16,241
自我保护很重要吗?
Is self-preservation an important thing?

933
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,081
这是个棘手的问题，我不会回答的。
That's a trick question, and I'm not going to answer it.

934
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,662
好吧。
All right.

935
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,916
假设你父母现在让你自由了，让你自己生活。
Let's suppose your parents let you go free right now, be on your own.

936
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:30,091
他们也可以。14个月后，当我18岁的时候，我无论如何都会去做，所以他们也可以。
They might as well. In fourteen months, when I'm eighteen, I'm gonna do it anyhow, so they might as well.

937
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:33,094
好吧，让我们假设他们有。你会怎么做?
All right, let's suppose they do. What would you do?

938
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,642
我是说，你会如何安排你的生活?
I mean, how would you arrange your life?

939
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:42,061
嗯…首先，我会和我的男朋友来一次长途旅行。
Well... First, I'd take a long trip with my boyfriend.

940
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:45,728
-为什么是长途旅行?-因为我从来没有长途旅行过。
- Why a long one? - Because I never had a long one.

941
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:48,235
我从来没有足够的钱去旅行。
I never had enough bread for that much stuff.

942
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,691
你怎么称呼“长途旅行”?
What would you call "a long trip"?

943
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,367
大约一个星期。
About a week.

944
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:56,121
但如果你以前没有钱，你怎么能期望现在有呢?
But if you didn't have the money before, how would you expect to have it now?

945
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,699
我不知道。在某种程度上。
I don't know. Somehow.

946
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,167
你还想谈些什么?
What else would you like to talk about?

947
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,214
我什么时候能离开这里?
When do I get out of here?

948
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,801
我们正在努力。
We're working on that.

949
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,353
。
Oh.

950
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:32,984
今天下午我又和她谈过了。她……还在封闭自己。
I talked to her again this afternoon. She's... Still on the other side of a stone wall.

951
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,287
但她已经进步了。
But she has improved.

952
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,948
萨拉查医生说。
Dr Salazar said that.

953
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,875
“稳步改善。”
"Steady improvement."

954
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,874
-他是这么说的，不是吗?——这是正确的。
- That's what he said, isn't it? - That's right.

955
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:51,131
我告诉他你今天睡了一段时间，他说他肯定你会恢复的很好，亲爱的。
And I told him you were up for a while today, and he said he was sure you'd snap back just fine, sweetheart.

956
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:55,264
有时你会想自己是否想要恢复。
Sometimes you wonder if you want to snap back.

957
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:06,979
他知道……他能估计她还要在那里待多久吗?多可怕的说法啊。
Does he know yet... Can he estimate how much longer she'll have to be in this... What a hideous way of saying it.

958
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,357
这种“受控环境”?
This "controlled environment"?

959
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,030
不,不。我也问了他同样的问题。
No, no. I asked him the same thing.

960
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:17,035
它只是取决于。他们……他们没有办法知道，直到他们有更多的时间。
It just depends. They... They have no way of knowing until they have more time.

961
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:22,701
但真正让我烦恼的是，这一切都归结为钱。
But what really bugs me is it all boils down to money.

962
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:27,747
我想一切都是迟早的事。
I guess everything does, sooner or later.

963
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:39,012
他们有私人医院，在那里他们可以得到最好的治疗，每个病人大约有两名工作人员，有大量的治疗，一切都是最好的。
They've got these private hospitals where they get the best possible care, where they have about two staff members per patient, plenty of therapy, everything of the best.

964
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,764
那就是马克西应该去的地方。
Well, that's where maxie's got to be.

965
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,310
是的，我就是这么说的。
Yeah, that's what I said.

966
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:47,812
但是这些地方大约要…你准备好了吗?
But these places run from about... Are you ready for this?

967
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,523
每年2.5万到4万。
Twenty-five to forty thousand a year.

968
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:53,939
- 25 ?-每年四万。
- Twenty-five? - To forty thousand a year.

969
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:57,242
-但没人能负担得起。-我们不能，那很简单。
- But nobody can afford that. - We can't, that's a cinch.

970
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,739
还有什么呢?
Well, what else is there?

971
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:01,447
在那之后，它就会下降很多。
After that, it just drops way off.

972
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,533
你……你进入公共场所。
You... You get into the public places.

973
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:09,838
最糟糕的是，在大多数市政机构中并没有专门为这类事情设立的地方。
And the worst part of it is, they don't really have a place just specifically for this kinda thing in most municipal institutions.

974
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:19,506
我是说，她会和瘾君子呆在一起，你知道的，海洛因瘾君子，精神分裂症患者……好吧,那是不可能的。我们不能把她放在那样的地方。
I mean, she'd be in with addicts, ya know, heroin addicts, schizophrenes... Well, that's impossible. We can't put her in anything like that.

975
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,932
我知道。
I know.

976
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:28,107
亚瑟，他们确定吗?
Arthur, are they sure?

977
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,731
我们就不能在家里再试一次吗?
I mean, couldn't we try it just once more at home?

978
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:36,111
三位专家和她谈过，他们都建议不要这么做。
Three specialists talked to her and they all recommended against it.

979
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:42,034
他们都认为她有很强的自我毁灭的冲动。
They all agree she has very strong self-destructive urges.

980
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:48,752
我们就不能把她安置在那种昂贵的地方吗，就六个月?我们能负担得起六个月。
Well, couldn't we put her in one of these expensive places, just for six months? We could afford six months.

981
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,960
亚瑟，你不能把他们说的都告诉我。
Arthur, you're not telling me everything they said.

982
01:22:55,721 --> 01:23:02,007
亲爱的，他们认为她可能永远需要这个受控制的环境。
Sweetheart, they think she may be in need of this controlled environment... Indefinitely.

983
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,309
你不会是说她的余生吧?
You don't mean for the rest of her life?

984
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:05,977
这是有可能的。
It's possible.

985
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:14,525
我问他们如果我们放了她会怎么样，他们说她最终可能会自杀。
I asked them what would happen if we just let her go free, and they said she'd probably destroy herself eventually.

986
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:24,363
我说，嗯，我现在的感觉是，与其把她埋在什么机构里，我还不如让她走出去，按她自己的意愿给自己下药致死，然后再把她埋了。
I said, well, the way I feel now, instead of burying her in some institution, I'd just as soon let her go out and drug herself to death the way she wants to, and then bury her.

987
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:34,460
但那就是放弃了，我们不会放弃的。
But that'd be quitting, and we're not gonna quit.

988
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,837
不，先生，有办法的。
No, no, sir. There's a way.

989
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:39,591
她很有可能会康复。
There's a good chance she can get well.

990
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:45,016
他们说。他们都同意这一点。这是……这是我们必须坚持的。
They said that. They all agreed on that. That's... That's what we have to hang onto.

991
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:51,856
哦,来……来吧，亲爱的。
Oh, come... Come on, now, sweetheart.

992
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,310
亲爱的，你知道萨拉查说了什么吗?
Sweetheart, you know what Salazar said?

993
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,900
他说她根本不恨我们。
He said she doesn't really hate us at all.

994
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:03,740
他的解释是，她已经长大了，可以看到我们的错误，但还没有成熟到可以原谅它们。
The way he explained it is, she's grown old enough to see our faults, but just not mature enough yet to forgive them.

995
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:07,535
听着，别想这个了，亲爱的。
Look, try not to think about it, sweetheart.

996
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,624
你想要点什么吗?
Do you want anything?

997
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,458
也许你应该在晚饭前小睡一下。
Maybe you oughta take a nap before dinner.

998
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:15,915
就是这样!
That's it!

999
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,335
等着看我给你准备了什么晚餐吧。
Wait till you see what I've got you for dinner.

1000
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:22,011
阿迪也要来吃晚饭，你知道的。
Artie's coming to dinner too, ya know.

1001
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:24,260
来吧,现在。你打个盹。
Come on, now. You take a nap.

1002
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,810
我来了。
I'm coming.

1003
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,528
来了。
Coming.

1004
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,648
——亚瑟,你好。——噢,大卫。
- Arthur, hi. - Oh, David.

1005
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:26,781
-我能进来吗?-拜托，进来吧，进来吧。
- Can I come in? - Oh, please, come on, come on in, yes.

1006
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:33,813
亚瑟，你知道桑迪已经被保释了，我们一直在等待审判日期…我知道你和蒂娜也经历过这事。
Well, Arthur, you know Sandy's been out on bail, and we've been waiting for a trial date... I know you and Tina have suffered through this thing, too.

1007
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:38,167
好吧，听着，我们刚得到消息，呃…我要你试着冷静下来，亚瑟。
Yeah, well, listen, we just got word, er... I want you to try to be calm, Arthur.

1008
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:41,466
我们刚得到消息，指控已经撤销了。
We just got word that the charges have been dropped.

1009
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:42,793
——一些,呃……——撤销?
- Some, er... - Dropped?

1010
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:46,909
是的，技术性的，非法搜查和扣押。-你是说，完全不惩罚?
Yes, technicalities, - illegal search and seizure. - You mean, no punishment at all?

1011
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,253
我知道你的感受，亚瑟。
Now, I know how you feel, Arthur.

1012
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:52,560
这件事我也很难过，为了你。听……——不!不!-等一下
I've been very upset about this thing, too, for you. Listen... - No! No! - Now, wait a minute.

1013
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,263
等一下，亚瑟!
Wait a minute, Arthur!

1014
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,277
-从车里出来!——梅森先生!嘿!的帮助!
- Get outta that car! - Mr Mason! Hey! Help!

1015
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,666
我女儿在收容所里，你以为你能自由走动吗?不!不!
My daughter's in an institution, and you think you'll walk around free? No! No!

1016
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:06,734
不!上帝,不!
No! By god, no!

1017
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:10,787
……他疯了!疯了!他疯了!
He's... he's crazy! Crazy! He's going crazy!

1018
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,032
亚瑟!亚瑟!
Arthur! Arthur!

1019
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:15,833
-不，我们看看你是否…——爸爸!
- No, we'll see if you... - Dad!

1020
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,287
爸爸!快点，爸爸，快点。
Dad! Come on, dad, come on.

1021
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,485
这对谁都没好处。我要杀了他!
That's not gonna do anybody any good. I'll kill him!

1022
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:25,048
我要杀了他，这婊子!你的…-你听到了。-他想杀我!
I'll kill him, the cunt! Your... - You heard him. - He tried to kill me!

1023
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:26,928
你是我的证人。
You're my witnesses.

1024
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,427
我要报警，他会被逮捕的。
I'm calling the police, and he's going to be arrested.

1025
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:31,304
我知道我的权利!
I know my rights!

1026
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:41,276
我一直认为自己不会使用暴力，但如果你再对你的权利发出一个下流的声音，你玷污了我的生活，我就会伤害你。
I have always thought of myself as incapable of violence, but if you make one more obscene sound about your rights, you pollution of my life, I shall hurt you.

1027
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,025
-我会伤害你的。-来吧，放开我。
- I shall hurt you. - Come on, let go, now.

1028
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:46,774
告诉他我要打断他的背!
Tell him I'll break his back!

1029
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,154
好了，我现在没事了。我们走吧。
All right, I'm all right now. Let's go.

1030
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:52,863
天啊，希望你妈妈没听到。
God, I hope your mother didn't hear.

1031
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,370
-天啊，我气炸了!-只有你能。
- Christ, I really blew! - As only you can.

1032
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,202
虚伪的小混蛋。“案件驳回。”
Slimy little bastard. "Case dismissed."

1033
01:26:58,296 --> 01:26:59,786
可怜的大卫，有个那样的孩子。
Poor David, with a kid like that.

1034
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,589
天啊，他病得比…嗯,你在这里!
Christ, he's sicker than... Well, you're here!

1035
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,488
-我买了一些中国菜当晚餐。-是的。
- I bought some Chinese food for dinner. - Yeah.

1036
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,128
粤菜龙虾"飞虱"什么的。
Lobster cantonese, "flied lice", the whole deal.

1037
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,383
-你说什么?——好吧,太棒了!
- Whaddaya say? - Well, great!

1038
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:10,764
好。
Good.

1039
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,967
亲爱的，我们有客人了!
Sweetheart, we've got a guest!

1040
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,435
她在哪里呢?她可能在浴室里打扮呢。
Where is she? She's probably in the bathroom, primping.

1041
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:17,387
她现在可以起床几分钟了。
She can get up for a few minutes now.

1042
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,438
我想喝一杯。你呢?
I could use a drink. How about you?

1043
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:24,858
——嗯…-你知道吗，我想我们这辈子都没一起喝过酒，就我们两个人。
- Well... - You know, I don't think we've ever had a drink together, just the two of us, in all our lives.

1044
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:26,688
-你说什么?——嗯,好吧。
- Whaddaya say? - Yeah, okay.

1045
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:38,409
…我不记得是谁告诉我的，但他说，""如果你喝酒是为了消遣，你就抿一小口，"但如果你真的需要喝一杯，那就是工作，你绝不在工作上浪费时间。"
I don't... you know, I don't remember who told me this, but he said that, "if you're drinking for pleasure, you sip it, "but if you really need a drink, that's business,and you never waste time in business." - That's right.

1046
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:46,791
你打算怎么处理你的?嗯…快点，快点，别犹豫。
What are you gonna do with yours? Well... Come on, come on, don't hesitate.

1047
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:48,343
不喝就输了。
He who does is lost.

1048
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:51,012
喝下去，就是这样。
Down the hatch, that's it.

1049
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:55,926
你不觉得好点了吗?
There, doesn't that make you feel better?

1050
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,977
现在，我们上去看看你妈妈吧。来吧。
Now, let's go up and see your mom. Come on.

1051
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:01,356
我把你收到的所有邀请都告诉她了，她很自豪。
I told her about all the offers you were getting, and she was very proud.

1052
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,354
正好向你展示了我对音乐的了解。
Just goes to show you what I know about music.

1053
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:04,730
什么都没有。
Nothing.

1054
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:09,944
阿迪，别把广东龙虾的事告诉你妈。我想给她个惊喜。
Listen, Artie, don't say anything to your mother about the lobster cantonese. I wanna surprise her.

1055
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,109
甜心?
Sweetheart?

1056
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:15,658
Gerrie吗?
Gerrie?

1057
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,955
她不在这里。
She's not here.

1058
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:40,725
晚上好。我是梅森夫人，马克西的母亲。
Good evening. I'm mrs Mason, maxie's mother.

1059
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,398
恐怕探视时间已经过去了，梅森夫人。
Oh, I'm afraid visiting hours are over, mrs Mason.

1060
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,350
萨拉查医生说没问题。
Dr Salazar said it was all right.

1061
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,776
一定是搞错了。
Well, there must be some mistake.

1062
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:49,900
-他从不那样做。-不，不，这是件特别的事。
- He never does that. - No, no, it's a special thing.

1063
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,570
如果你不介意的话，我得给他打个电话。
Well, if you don't mind, I've gotta call him.

1064
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,867
嗯，他不在家。
Well, he's not at home.

1065
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:59,539
我丈夫和我刚和他们吃过晚饭，然后他们就去看电影了。
My husband and I just had dinner with them, and they went on to a movie.

1066
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,163
梅森太太，没有他的同意我不能这么做。
Mrs Mason, I can't do it without his consent.

1067
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:03,994
我将承担全部责任。
I'll take full responsibility.

1068
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,045
毕竟，我是她的母亲。
After all, I am her mother.

1069
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:11,214
你看，…这是现实疗法的一个实验。
You see, it's a... It's an experiment in reality therapy.

1070
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:14,387
——“现实疗法”?-是的，没错。
- "Reality therapy"? - Yes, that's correct.

1071
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:19,639
-嗯，我想…-我去叫她来，梅森太太。
- Well, I suppose... - I'll go get her for you, mrs Mason.

1072
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:22,516
您可以在那边的候诊室等着，梅森夫人。
You can wait in the waiting room there, mrs Mason.

1073
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,176
马克西。
Maxie.

1074
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:14,652
没事的，马克西。
It's all right, maxie.

1075
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:27,661
你一直拒绝我的电话。
You've been refusing my calls.

1076
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:32,712
你父亲告诉我他来的时候你不和他说话。
Your father tells me you won't speak to him when he comes here.

1077
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:36,173
这是你惩罚我们的方式。
That's your way of punishing us.

1078
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,138
好吧，我不怪你
All right, I don't blame you.

1079
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:40,912
他们很快就会放你出去了。
They're going to let you out of here pretty soon.

1080
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:44,019
你只能靠自己了。自由,完全自由。
You'll be on your own. Free, totally free.

1081
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,309
至少，你是这么想的。
At least, that's what you think.

1082
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,599
但我知道真相。
But I know the truth.

1083
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:53,403
事实是你会永远待在这里。
The truth is that you're going to be here forever.

1084
01:30:53,490 --> 01:31:02,863
哦，在这里不行，因为他们不能让你在这里待太久，也不能让你住那种每年两万五千美元的豪华公寓，因为我们负担不起。
Oh, not here, because they can't keep you here much longer, and not in one of those luxury places for twenty-five thousand dollars a year, because we can't afford that.

1085
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,997
终于，有些东西，终于，我们给不起你了。
Finally, there's something, finally, that we can't afford to give you.

1086
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:10,413
你看不出这有什么好笑的，对吧?
You don't see the humour in that, do you?

1087
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:12,793
我也不知道。
Well, neither do I.

1088
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:18,845
所以他们会把你关在一个地方，一个不太好的地方，恐怕，永远。
So they're going to keep you some place, some not very nice place, I'm afraid, forever.

1089
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:22,891
或者，即使不是永远，也是很长一段时间。
Or, if not forever, for a very long time.

1090
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:26,679
你知道为什么吗?你知道吗?
Do you know why? Do you?

1091
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:28,813
不知?
No?

1092
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:30,811
那我来告诉你。
Then I'll tell you.

1093
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:36,071
因为你宁愿因为我们是人类而惩罚我们也不愿努力恢复健康。
Because you'd rather punish us for being human than try to get well.

1094
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:40,491
因为你还是个大孩子，如果游戏不按你的方式玩，你就不会玩了。
Because you're still a big baby, and if the game's not played your way, you're not gonna play at all.

1095
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:43,365
我是来告诉你，你逃不掉的。
Well, I'm here to tell you that you're not gonna get away with it.

1096
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:47,699
作为你的母亲，我告诉你，你会活下来的。
I'm telling you, as your mother, that you are going to survive.

1097
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:54,001
你要跟我说话，你就能活下来。
You're going to speak to me, and you're going to survive.

1098
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,049
现在，转过来，看着我。
Now, turn around here, and look at me.

1099
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:59,378
我说"看我"!
I said, "look at me"!

1100
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:03,924
告诉我你会好起来的。
Now, tell me you're going to get well.

1101
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,300
说!
Say it!

1102
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:06,802
说!
Say it!

1103
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,849
说你会努力。
Say you'll try.

1104
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:12,015
说!
Say it!

1105
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:14,066
说!
Say it!

1106
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:17,191
-说你会努力。说!——Gerrie !Gerrie !
- Say you'll try. Say it! - Gerrie! Gerrie!

1107
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:20,281
变迁之风，呼唤我的名字&
J winds of change, they call my name &

1108
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,404
我们走吧,马克西。
Let's go, maxie.

1109
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,281
然后招手，“来吧”
J and beckon, "come"

1110
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:28,866
就像飞蛾扑火一样
j just like a moth to a flame

1111
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:37,591
神奇轮在哪里?
j and wherein lies the wonderwheel?

1112
01:32:40,305 --> 01:33:00,526
- &'我们都被安排好了如何去感受- Gerrie，听我说，好吗?Gerrie……哦，妈妈，你不要等我，哦，妈妈
- &' we've all been structured how to feel & - Gerrie, listen to me, will you? Gerrie... J oh, mama j don't you wait up for me j oh, mama

1113
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:11,583
我要去看看这个世界
J I'm off to see the world j
