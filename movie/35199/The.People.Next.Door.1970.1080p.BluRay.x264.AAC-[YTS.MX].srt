7

You can't dance to it.

You can't dance to it.

29
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,051
Well, you see, er...

30
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,802
- This is a different sound.
- Well, I don't want a different sound.

31
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,183
- Well, can we just play breaks?
- No.

32
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,386
- We'll give you a week for fifty bucks.
- Forget it!

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,000
- Look, we'll give you a week for nothing!
- You ain't worth it.

34
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,771
We'll give him something he can dance to!

35
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,485
You're gonna have
the most famous club in town!

36

- I'll help!

- Drop dead, you ugly bastard.

spelled right now.

Come see the ducks!

00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,156
Hey, David, how about that?

90
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,956
Oh, maxie!

91
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,707
Whoops, I gotta be careful.
I'll get you all bloody.

92
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,609
- Sandy: How many d'you get?
- Arthur: Twelve, altogether.

93
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,778
Tina: Wow! David, why don't
you ever do a thing like that?

94
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,293
- I thought the limit was three.
- That's if we get caught.

95
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,380
Actually, there were fourteen!

96
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,930
What happened to the other two?

97
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,224
They were crips.
They flocked off into the weeds.

98
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,597
Gerrie: Arthur, they won't
suffer long, will they?

99
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,351
Oh, no, no.
Some fox'll probably get 'em.

100
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,711
- Foxes have to eat too, ya know.
- Sandy: Here, mr Mason.

101
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,463
- Let me take 'em into the kitchen for you.
- Oh, thank you, Sandy.

102
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,193
Oh, isn't my son wonderful?

103
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,272
Speaking of sons, I wonder
what's become of ours? Artie?

104
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,512
Gerrie: He's... he's not feeling well.
He has a headache.

105
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,492
Well, carrying fifteen pounds
of hair around

106
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,071
- would give anybody a headache.
- Tina: Isn't he funny? Arthur, you're so funny!

107
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,532
Well, I think we gotta go.
Come on, Tina.

108
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,622
Let's go. It's time to go.

109
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,829
Tina:
J he loves me, yeah, yeah, yeah j

110
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,459
j loves me, yeah, yeah... j

111
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,347
Arthur: Art? Artie?

112
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,773
Artie?

113
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,851
Hey, shrubbery skull!

114
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,936
Come on down, we're having dinner.

115
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,737
Hey, mop-head! “Arthur...

116
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,529
Now, what I'm...

117
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,732
All I'm doing
is asking him to come down.

118
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,442
Come on down, Arturo!

119
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,529
Well, why doesn't he come down?

120
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,492
Roast duck!

121
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,287
And happiness.

122
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,748
Arthur: Now, Artie...

123
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,588
Artie? Come on down!

124
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,332
I'm not very hungry.

125
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,196
Well, if you don't wanna eat,
at least send...

126
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,336
Send your hair down!

127
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,547
I think he wants to practise.

128
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,263
Arthur:
Practice, huh? Is that what he calls it?

129
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,968
Hell! Come on, Arthur!

130
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,767
- Gerrie: Come on now, honey.
- All right, but why be selfish?

131
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,562
No need for his hair to starve!

132
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,442
Why can't you leave him alone
about his hair?

133
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,608
Just because it isn't
the same length as yours!

134
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,196
What the hell did I do?

135
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,370
When are you two
gonna stop tuning up

136
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,456
and start playing something?

137
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,299
Come on, sis, let's play
some real music.

138
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,887
J I got music

139
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,465

- J I got daisies... j

142
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,020
that's what I call music!

143
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,099
Sandy brought some cheesecake.

144
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,685
Fine. They're just playing this
to amuse the old man, Sandy.

145
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,566
They don't like it
because it has a melody.

146
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,239
You know, I bet they like it
better than you think, mr Mason.

147
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,947
J' I got starlight,
I got sweet dreams j

148
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,277

149
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,076
- No, no, I gotta be goin'.
- Thanks for the cheesecake, Sandy.

150
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,607
J who could ask for anything more? J

151
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,575
now that's the kinda stuff
you oughta play.

152
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,456
The kinda stuff
people wanna hear.

153
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,584
That other stuff, nobody'll
pay you a dime for that.

154
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,880
- Dad, let me tell you something...
- Oh, maxie, never mind.

155
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,217
Since the almighty dollar
is your way of judging everything,

156
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,764
I've got news for you.

157
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,432
Artie and his group have got a job,

158
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,430
starting tonight, paying
two hundred a week.

159
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,845
Artie, is that true?

160
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,417
Yeah, well, I was gonna
tell you tonight,

161
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,668
when I had my costume on, but...

162
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,398
But that's wonderful!

163
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,476
Two hundred bucks, huh?

164
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,486
Well, some people have
more money than brains.

165
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,597
Newsreader: Pentagon said today
that the present operation

166
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,704
is an example of American and
south vietnamese co-operation,

167
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,827
driving the viet cong out of
critical rice-growing areas.

168
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,042
Advancing American units
seized forward positions

169
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,869
under intense small-arms fire...

170
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,964
You gotta be kidding.

171
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,669
You're not going out on the
street like that, are ya?

172
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,464
Whatever happened to civilisation?

173
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,838
It's part of our thing, you know.

174
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,762
Your thing, huh?

175
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,889
Well, you'll probably be
doing their thing soon,

176
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,187
so you might as well
have fun while you can.

177
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,813
Oh, shut that stuff off,
will ya? I'm sick of it.

178
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,611
Bang, bang, bang.

179
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,034
Well, so long.

180
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,783
Gerrie: Arthur!

181
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,036
Arthur! Will you come here,
please? Quickly!

182
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,107
- What's the matter?
- Please, hurry.

183
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,247
- What is it?
- Maxie: I don't like it.

184
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,461
It's too far. Too far.

185
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,543
I wanna go home!

186
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,507
I hear mountains.

187
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,302
- What the hell?
- I hear mountains. I...

188
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,724
- Darling, darling...
- Mountains! Mountains!

189
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,053
Go back, sweetheart.
Don't even look. Let me handle this.

190
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,145
I'm all right. I really am.

191
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,189
I'll be back. Don't worry.

192
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,108
What the devil
are you doing in there?

193
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,151
I'm looking. I see.

194
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,987
Look at me.

195
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,692
Oh, way, way up! See me!

196
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,576
- Look!
- Maxie, come on outta there.

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,366
- Gerrie: Arthur...
- She's drunk.

198
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,335
Gerrie: Darling, darling...

199
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,084
I see music.

200
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,006
Look!

201
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,380
Look! Look at the music!

202
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,836
She's tripping.
“What? She's what?

203
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,421
Artie: It's okay, maxie.

204
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,303
Artie's here. Don't worry.

205
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,849
Artie!

206
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,099
Sweet guitar!

207
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,855
Sweet, sweet, sweet guitar.

208
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,845
What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter with her?

209
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,032
Can you be quiet for a minute?
Have you ever heard of LSD?

210
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,114
- Maxie: I wanna go home.
- Artie: It's okay, maxie. It's okay.

211
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,290
Maxie, how much did you take?

212
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,208
Not much. I didn't take much.

213
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,703
LSD?!

214
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,381
Bring me back.
I wanna come back. I'm scared.

215
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,380
The mountain's coming.

216
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,508
The mountain's coming!

217
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,301
God...

218
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,767
I'm electric!

219
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,266
I'm electric! I'm...

220
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,063
Artie:
Artie's with ya. Don't worry.

221
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,482
The mountain won't hurt you.

222
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,435
Come on, now.

223
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,316
Walk with Artie,
to your own bed.

224
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,523
- Come on, now.
- Arthur: Come on, baby.

225
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,952
I wanna go home.
I want my daddy.

226
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,038
I want my daddy. Daddy!

227
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,537
Your daddy's here, baby.
Right here.

228
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,204
Razor blades!

229
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,715
It's okay.
It's okay, Artie's with ya.

230
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,678
Artie's gonna get ya home.

231
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,303
- Get some sleeping pills.
- Shouldn't I call the doctor?

232
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,761
Don't call anybody. Do like he says.
Get the sleeping pills.

233
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,357
Maxie, come on.

234
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,108
Your own little bed.

235
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,319
Safe at home. Come on.

236
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,448
Safe at home. Nice and soft,
in your own little bed.

237
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,076
Bed? Bed?!

238
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,287
Artie: Artie's gonna get you home.
Just... just try...

239
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,799
- How strong are they?
- Gerrie: It says one for sleep.

240
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,466
Let me have two.

241
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,266
Who's that?

242
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,681
Who's that?!

243
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,271
Arthur: I wanna talk to you.

244
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,836
Dad, you're just gonna
have to be quiet

245
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,272
while I'm talking her down.
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,942
Here ya are, maxie.

247
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,031
Couple of caps for ya.

248
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,988
Hey, tickets home.

249
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,110
Come on, now.

250
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,416
Tickets home.

251
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,129
Now, you know who's here?

252
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,256
Your mom's here.

253
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,434
Isn't that nice?

254
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,195
Mom...

255
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,492
- I'm cold, mom.
- Mommy's with you. Sssssh.

256
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,203
Just keep talking to her, mom.
If we can get her to sleep,

257
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,879
she oughta be okay
in a couple of hours.

258
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,548
- I'm cold...
- Mommy's got a warm blanket for you.

259
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,627
- Goin' home?
- Yes, darling, going home.

260
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,302
- Goin' home, momma?
- Yes, sweetheart.

261
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,927
- Goin' home?
- Yes, my darling. Sssh. Yes, baby.

262
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,972
- Sssssh...
- I wanna talk to you. Now!

263
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,396
- Yes, my darling.
- I'm cold, mom.

264
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,561
Ssh...

265
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,233
Arthur: Hey...

266
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,507
- Hey, you got any more of that stuff?
- Dad, you gotta believe me...

267
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,896
I don't. Empty your pockets.

268
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,981
- I swear...
- I said empty 'em!

269
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,489
No.

270
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,693
Then, goddamn it, I will.

271
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,707
I knew something like this
was gonna happen

272
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,413
when she started hanging out
with that freaky gang of yours.

273
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,717
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

274
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,008
Your mother'll send your clothes
to that freak joint where you work.

275
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,569
You're not comin' back here, ever.
For anything!

276
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,193
And stay away from
your sister, do you hear?

277
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,323
You...

278
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,240
Now, you listen to me,
you no-good punk!

279
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,620
If your sister suffers
any kind of damage because of this,

280
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,122
any permanent damage,

281
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,108
you better start runnin',
because I'm comin' after you,

282
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,498
and I'll break
every bone in your body!

283
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,543
I don't respect you anymore.

284
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,334
I think she's going to sleep.

285
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,421
What happened?

286
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,916
- I kicked him out.
- No!

287
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,002
Freaky little punk. Artie!

288
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,472
Why would she
take that stuff, anyhow?

289
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,844
Is she nuts or somethin'?

290
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,302
Perfect kid, normal as they come,
a kid who's got everything.

291
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,140
I think we ought to
talk to somebody.

292
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,690
Who? Who? A head shrinker?
Absolutely not.

293
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,781
What about David?

294
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,654
I'm not getting the people next door

295
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,136
- involved in my private life!
- Arthur, please.

296
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,596
- I want her to go to sleep.
- Listen, gerrie,

297
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,765
if you feel you have to turn to...
To David at a time like...

298
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,325
- Turn to David?
- That's what I said.

299
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,781
- We need advice.
- You don't trust my judgement?

300
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:33,415
Oh, it's not your anything, Arthur.

301
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,916
It's our.

302
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,502
We're failing.
We have to face that.

303
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,175
Look, if you wanna go to
Tina and David, you go!

304
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,883
Lemme tell you one thing.

305
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,328
I'm not taking the responsibility
for anything that happens after that.

306
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,764
Is that clear?
It's your responsibility.

307
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,055
Go ahead. Go.

308
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,026
You know something, Arthur?

309
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,654
Every time we come to
any kind of a crisis, where...

310
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,356
Where a decision has got to be made,

311
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,112
you get furious at me.

312
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,245
That's a lie.

313
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,243
And refuse to take any responsibility.

314
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,572
That's a damn lie,
and you know it.

315
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,289
I'm going next door.

316
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,841
You do that.

317
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,806
Neighbour: Hey there, gerrie,

318
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,308
are you and Arthur
going to be home later?

319
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,731
Oh... oh, yes. Yes, I imagine.

320
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,671
Well, there's nothing much
doing on TV tonight,

321
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,061
so Gloria and I thought
we'd rather look at you and Arthur

322
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,488
through a Martini.
What do you think?

323
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,909
In about a half hour, okay?
Okay, gerrie?

324
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,863
Is she mad at us?

325
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,079
Have you been eating her geraniums again?

326
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,047
- Mrs Mason!
- Oh, Sandy.

327
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,377
- Is there something wrong?
- Oh, well... sort of.

328
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,804
Is your father home?

329
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,718
You know mom, she gets
kinda sleepy after dinner sometimes.

330
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,100
Er... gee, no,
dad's over at the school.

331
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,727
There's been a riot.

332
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,331
What did he say?

333
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,503
He's at the school.

334
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,170
Let's go.

335
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,599
Do you think we ought to?

336
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,486
J towers made of ice

337
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:10,618

342
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,431
Fascist pigs!

343
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,479
You ain't got no warrant!

344
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,312
Man: Ho chi minh! Ho chi minh!

345
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,693
- Get outta here!
- Watch the glass.

346
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,866
Several people:
Ho! Ho! Ho chi minh!

347
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,409
None of us is gonna win!

348
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,987
Ho! Ho! Ho chi minh!

349
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,824
Get your hands off of me!
Who do you think you are?!

350
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,013
- Oh, hi.
- David.

351
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,744
Some of my students
are gonna need these records

352
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,788
- to get into college next year.
- This is terrible.

353
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,372
- We shouldn't be bothering you.
- It's all right. It's all over.

354
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,352
It's just a clean-up job now.
Arthur...

355
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,027
Gerrie told me the bare details
on the phone.

356
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,605
Look what they did
to your office, David,

357
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,611
and you're the principal.

358
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:35,320
David, what the hell do you
do for kids in this world?

359
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,996
We did everything
humanly possible.

360
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,951
I mean, we gave her tennis lessons,
piano lessons, cheerleader,

361
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,877
good home, good neighbourhood.

362
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,922
- Gave her love.
- Love? Of course we gave her love.

363
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,749
I know, I know.

364
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,176
If we were a neurotic bunch of...

365
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,720
You know what I mean.
Then I could understand, but...

366
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,469
Oh, excuse me, gerrie.
Would you like to sit down?

367
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,424
No, I'm fine.

368
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,997
Would you like some coffee
before we start?

369
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,433
Oh, yes, please. Just black.

370
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,310
David: Do you have a dime? Yes.

371
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,148
David: I'm afraid to look at
what they did in the library,

372
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,233
but I've got to.

373
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,777
How about that?
Right through the door.

374
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,993
They finally found
a use for books.

375
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,406
Oh, here, David.

376
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,911
I can't understand why they didn't
destroy the coffee machine.

377
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,493
Even I agree the coffee machine
is a bourgeois plot.

378
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,504
J the filaments within

379
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:39,054
j sweet medusa

380
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:45,056
j I'd like to play your game j

381
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,738
our children can come to us
about anything. They know that.

382
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,532
If he can get her to really say
what she thinks, deep down.

383
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,701
- That's what I mean.
- He's right.

384
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,915
All the things
she may not have said

385
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,243
because she may have thought
that you didn't want her to.

386
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,702
But we did!

387
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,588
But did you really
want to, sweetheart?

388
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,337
Or were you afraid?
Tell the truth.

389
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,594
I... I have to admit
that I was at fault myself,

390
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,640
because I didn't insist
on it sooner. But...

391
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,135
Oh, sweetheart,
you're going to enjoy it.

392
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,973
You'll get to know your daughter
better than you ever dreamed possible.

393
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,317
Listen, I don't know if either one of us
is gonna be able to stand it, but...

394
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,610
Geronimo!

395
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,813
It's all around us, gerrie.

396
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,819
They wanna pick our whole society
up by the heels and shake it,

397
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,777
and see what drops out.
At least the healthy ones do.

398
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,279
The others just wanna

399
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,365
try to get away from it,
the best way they can.

400
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,537
Yeah, with drugs.

401
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,380
Oh, sweetheart,
in a funny way, we're lucky.

402
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,924
We... we caught this thing
at the very beginning.

403
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,844
All right, we lost our son
to this sickness,

404
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,046
or craziness, or whatever it is,

405
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,974
but we're not going to
lose our little girl.

406
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,613
Hello, electric crash pad.

407
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,413
Hello.

408
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,752
I can't understand you, honey.

409
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,587
Who?

410
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,297
Artie?

411
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,293
Is he one of the musicians?

412
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:42,340
Some drunk broad wants to leave
a message for the organ player.

413
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,310
Man: Hang up!

414
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,889
Hello?

415
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,228
Oh...

416
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,436
I wish to hell I could
get in touch with Rafferty.

417
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,826
I'd cancel that damn tennis match.

418
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,496
I'm not gonna get a wink of sleep.

419
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,918
Tennis!

420
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,376
What kinda reflexes
am I gonna have?

421
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,888
Maxie! Maxie!

422
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,439
Oh, darling.

423
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,187
Everything's...
Everything's all right.

424
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,018
There's nothing to cry about now.

425
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,186
Darling, it was a mistake.

426
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,022
Anybody can make a mistake.

427
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,449
We're going to forget
that it ever happened.

428
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,369
There, now. Now, now, darling.
Everything's all right.

429
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,867
- Isn't it, daddy?
- Yes, baby, everything's fine.

430
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,449
- Just fine.
- I can't help it.

431
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,417
Well, darling, try to stop
for a minute.

432
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,624
Daddy and I want to talk to you.

433
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,926
Not now. Please, not now.

434
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,880
- Do you wanna go back to sleep?
- No, I... I can't.

435
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,135
Is there any particular thing
you're crying about?

436
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,720
- Arthur: Baby, everything's fine.
- No, I just feel like crying.

437
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,814
Arthur: Come...

438
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,775
Baby, I...

439
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,786
- Maybe if you went back to sleep.
- I don't wanna sleep.

440
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,159
I'm gonna sit up and wait for Artie.

441
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,535
- Darling...
- Let me handle this.

442
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,787
Maxie...

443
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,794
Maxie, we know
Artie brought you that stuff.

444
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,801
What have you done?

445
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,846
- Well...
- I sent him away.

446
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,631
Artie?

447
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,306
- You kicked him out?
- Well, your father felt that...

448
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,136
We know how much
you love your brother.

449
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,188
He's our son, don't forget.

450
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,017
This is hard for us, too.
It's... it's hard for your father,

451
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,772
much harder than you think.

452
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,569
You know what you are, daddy?

453
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,402
You're a jackass.

454
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,654
She's trying to protect him.
It's always like this.

455
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,157
He lies, and she swears to it.

456
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,705
You're both jackasses.

457
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,603
I think we ought to wait
till tomorrow to talk about it.

458
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,347
I think we ought to
talk about it right now.

459
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,369
You're not going to like it.

460
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,876
May I have a drag of that?

461
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,463
I didn't know you smoked.

462
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,760
There's a lot you don't know.

463
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,351
Go ahead.

464
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,860
This is not the first time
I've tripped out.

465
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,860
I've been up at least fifteen times.

466
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,567
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

467
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,244
I've tried all the grooves,
even horse,

468
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,663
but acid's my scene.

469
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,331
You... you talk like...

470
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,535
Where did you get these words?

471
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,620
This is me, daddy.

472
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,296
This is me.

473
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,499
My daughter's sick.
My little girl is sick.

474
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,255
I'm not sick. You are.

475
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,712
- That's why you're so miserable.
- I'm not miserable.

476
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,013
At least, I wasn't.

477
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,557
You know,
you oughta drop a little acid.

478
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,259
Like...

479
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,719
See god, mom.

480
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,977
Arthur: See god, huh?

481
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,769
You were really seeing god when we
found you in that closet.

482
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,727
I was on a bad trip.
That can happen.

483
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,609
Shouldn't have taken
speed with my acid.

484
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,779
Arthur, I'm going to be ill.
I have to get out of here.

485
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,449
No, darling, listen to me.

486
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,996
- But...
- No, you just sit down here.

487
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,502
Gimme that.

488
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,207
Now, aside from your
freaky brother's influence,

489
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,667
what got you started on this stuff?

490
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,465
My brother's influence
has always been

491
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,842
to tell me to leave
this whole scene alone.

492
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,469
I don't believe that,
but go ahead.

493
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,472
I took acid because
I wanted to be a better person.

494
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,561
It's a fine way to be
a better person, all right.

495
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,857
And also, I guess,
because you and...

496
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,644
Mom and the world in general
just keep me uptight all the time.

497
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,230
We keep you uptight, do we?

498
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,861
What... now, how do we do that?

499
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,193
Just by being ridiculous.

500
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,203
You know, dumb, phoney.

501
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,324
You...

502
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,913
In other words, you hate us.

503
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,588
Yes, I... I think so.

504
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,876
You say we're dumb. Waell...

505
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,586
Can you give me an example?

506
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,763
Well, like everything I tell you,
you believe.

507
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,094
For instance?

508
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,346
Like if I tell you
one of the kids is nice,

509
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,348
you both say, "oh, that's nice.

510
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,476
"Then you can spend the night over there
because it's a nice family."

511
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,183
And that kid might be
the biggest head you ever saw.

512
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,894
In other words, to trust
is to be a fool.

513
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,238
You are a sick person.

514
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,536
Mom, we didn't talk
about my sex life.

515
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,864
What's the matter?
You scared to ask?

516
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,496
Well, your worst suspicions are true.

517
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,855
Would you believe, this morning?

518
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,665
I wasn't at the hospital
like you thought.

519
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,587
I was with a boy.

520
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,381
You know, fucking.

521
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,805
What boy?

522
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,051
You'd try to hurt him,
wouldn't you?

523
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,728
You're sixteen years old!

524
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,264
Oh, shit.

525
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,066
It was that Elliot boy,
wasn't it?

526
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,105
Sorry, daddy, I'll have to
take the fifth on that.

527
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,856
Anyhow, there was
another one before him.

528
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,366
For more than a year now.

529
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,615
Oh, don't worry, mom,
I'm not gonna have a baby.

530
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,037
I'm on the pill.

531
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,534
Where would you...?

532
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,207
You're sixteen.
Where would you get such a thing?

533
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,002
It's easy.
All the girls have 'em.

534
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,830
Ones that want them.

535
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,666
- Am I losing my mind?
Arthur: No.

536
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,128
- Did I cause this?
- No. You've been a good mother.

537
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,783
I'm not gonna let you
take the blame for this.

538
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,718
She's no good, that's all,
she's rotten.

539
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,369
- It happens in a family sometimes.
- Oh, she's sick, she's sick.

540
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,348
You and daddy did it
before you were married.

541
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,555
I heard you talking about it.

542
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,853
You remember Sharon,
that used to come

543
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,423
and spend the night
with me last year?

544
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,234
Dr Bernard's daughter.

545
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,314
Well, she used to bring
her father's stethoscope,

546
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,065
and we'd go into the hall

547
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,197
and put the stethoscope
on your bedroom door.

548
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,616
Daddy!

549
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,478
- We've got to get her to a doctor.
- She's not sick, she's crazy.

550
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,271
- Arthur...
- Kids nowadays are crazy!

551
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,146
Don't you understand? If she
weren't sick, this couldn't happen.

552
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,773
It just couldn't happen.

553
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,104
I gotta get some sleep.

574
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,156

- Hmm?

575
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,780

Artie'll know where she is.

595
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,561
Will you look at this!

596
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,980
He knows this place, knows it.
He came straight here.

597
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,857
Where do I go?

598
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,775
- I'll show you.
- No, just tell me.

599
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,945
- Second floor, last door on the right.
- Gerrie: Arthur.

600
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,365
Darling, stay here.
I don't want you to see this.

601
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,783
Arthur, be careful.

602
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,827
- What floor?
- Second.

603
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,581
Stay with your mother.

604
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,126
Woman:
You get outta here, Lenny! Get out!

605
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,803
Woman: Get out!

606
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:08,460
Hey, you from the red cross, man?

607
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,508
We gave already.

608
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,713
Where's maxie?

609
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,048
Maxie?

610
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,926
I don't know no maxie.

611
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,387
You know her all right.
She comes here all the time.

612
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,642
She's a minor, too.

613
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,940
So, you better tell me
where she is, and do it fast,

614
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,392
or you're gonna end up in jail.

615
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,194
Hey, I ain't seen nobody, okay?

616
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,737
I'm comin' back, with cops!

617
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,321
Daddy!

618
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,577
You stupid, freaked-out head!

619
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,003
Why, you...

620
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,960
Keep away from me.

621
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,375
Keep away from me.

622
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,886
What's the matter, daddy?

623
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,672
You scared, huh?

624
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,678
Huh? You're scared, aren't you?
Aren't you?!

625
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,310
Daddy's scared.

626
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,310
Daddy's scared!

627
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,900
Look at him!

628
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,549
I'll run away again,
just as soon as I can.

629
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,113
Mr Mason? Yes. Dr Lauren?

630
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,690
Yeah, come in. Sit down.

631
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,868
Er... Carol, you want to leave
a coffee for mr Mason?

632
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:57,660
No, thanks.

633
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,362
Oh, it's all right.
I can get some more.

634
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,073
- No, really, thank you.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

635
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,416
Sit down.

636
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,091
Well, from what you told me
about this boy on the phone,

637
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,385
I should talk directly
to the father.

638
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,220
Oh, that'll never happen.

639
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,922
Believe me, I know this guy.

640
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,178
No, I was thinking that,
by talking to you,

641
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,134
I'll get a better idea of
what to tell him.

642
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,437
You know, some sensible advice.

643
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,185
Tell me about this guy.

644
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,852
- The father?
- Yeah.

645
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,653
Oh, he's, er... I guess
he's just your average Joe.

646
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,526
Maybe a cut above.
You know the type.

647
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,109
He works hard, he likes the fights,
he drinks a little too much,

648
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,740
that... that kinda thing.

649
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,500
I get the impression he's a...
He's a pretty good father.

650
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:50,546
- At least he tries to be.
- What doesn't the boy like about his parents?

651
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,665
Well, they had a talk with him,
and, er...

652
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,168
They found that he's, er...
He's pretty hostile.

653
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,759
- He calls 'em phonies, stupid...
- Are they?

654
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,053
No, not...

655
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:04,432
Not for my money.
Not any more than anybody else.

656
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,683
At least they're
trying to understand, to...

657
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,730
To improve the relationship,

658
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,935
which is a hell of a lot more
than that boy is doing. I mean...

659
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,112
You ever been skin diving?

660
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,447
- Skin diving?
- Yeah.

661
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,570
I mean, I never thought
I'd communicate with a fish

662
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,276
until I went scuba diving.

663
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,452
You stand in front of
one of those fish tanks,

664
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,953
stare in at this dumb little fish,
and they stare back at you, and...

665
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,659
Nothing.

666
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,836
And then you go down
into their world,

667
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,878
swim around,
hell, they'll play tag with you,

668
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,582
they'll tease you,
seem to grin at you...

669
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,339
They communicate.

670
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,509
Oughta try it sometime.

671
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,426
Now...

672
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,557
What specifically did this boy do
that got you,

673
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,639
and his parents,

674
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,192
- so upset?
- Not me. I... I wasn't upset.

675
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,506
- Not personally.
- I understand.

676
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,363
After all, he's their kid.
“What... what did he do?

677
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,608
Well, he took some LSD,
right in the home.

678
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,865
- Mm-hmm.
- He had one of those bad, er...

679
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,412
- Trips. Bummer.
- Yeah, that's it.

680
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,458
Then, this... he ran away from home
and his parents found him

681
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,751
all the way down in the east village
loaded with drugs

682
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,797
and in bed with a...
With a girl, one of the ugliest...

683
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,261
What did the parents do?

684
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,134
They took him home.

685
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,216
What else?

686
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,893
That's it.
They don't know what to do.

687
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,555
- Okay, I've got some advice for you.
- Great.

688
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,062
Run, don't walk.

689
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,771
Family therapy.

690
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,603
You mean, send her
to a psychoanalyst?

691
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,188
"Her"?

692
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,114
Did I say "her"?

693
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,284
No, I meant... l meant "him".

694
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,701
But don't send him. Take him.

695
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,911
Family therapy.

696
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,454
- The parents, too?
- Parents, most of all.

697
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,041
Oh, he'll...
He'll never do that.

698
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,172
Well, you talk to him.

699
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,137
No, I know him.
He's not the type.

700
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,179
You... you fry to convince him.

701
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,115
Nobody...

702
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,626
Seems very talkative today.

703
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,629
Frankly, doctor,

704
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:39,027
I don't think we were getting
much done here in these sessions.

705
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,837
How many of 'em? Four? Five?

706
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,128
All I've heard is
what a big phoney I am.

707
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,054
All right, maybe I am.
Personally, I don't think I am.

708
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,828
But, if my daughter wants
to tell me that,

709
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,592
let her tell me for free.

710
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,560
Nothing personal, doc.

711
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,262
What do you say to that, maxie?

712
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,222
I... I... I don't know.

713
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,608
You must have some thoughts about it.

714
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,143
Not really.

715
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,354
Dr margolin:
How about you, gerrie?

716
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:05,196
Well, I...
I know it is expensive,

717
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,653
but it seems to me that just the fact
that she's coming here with us,

718
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,659
and... and... and sitting here
is important.

719
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,532
Do I have a choice?

720
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,913
Dr margolin:
Maxie, would you do me a favour?

721
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,004
Maybe.

722
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,670
Every time you come here,
you wear those dark glasses

723
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:21,044
and that scarf,
so I can hardly see you.

724
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,421
I'm passively alienated.

725
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,754
She memorises these damn phrases
and then just can't wait to use 'em.

726
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,555
Dr margolin:
You're a pretty girl.

727
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,885
It would be nice to see you
while we talk.

728
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,392
Much better. Thank you.

729
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,195
Maxie, why do you think
your dad is a phoney?

730
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,910
Well, for one thing,
he's a tail-chaser.

731
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,119
Do you care to amplify that?

732
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,292
I've seen him with a woman
several times.

733
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,498
Maybe Arthur has an explanation.

734
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,625
Gerrie:
I've known for a long time.

735
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:04,668
- Dr margolin: By any evidence?
- No, I... I just knew, that's all.

736
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,423
Women always know.

737
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,254
Dr margolin:
Sometimes you're wrong.

738
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,135
Oh, when we suspect it,
we can be wrong,

739
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,717
but when we know it,
then we're always right.

740
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,222
Dr margolin: Not always.

741
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,762
Always.

742
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:20,065
Whether we admit it to ourselves
or not is another question, but...

743
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,353
I did admit it, and I
decided to live with it.

744
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,151
But maxie couldn't.
Is that right, maxie?

745
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,732
I couldn't care less
what he does.

746
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,943
That's his thing. Let him do it.

747
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,781
Just like suffering is her thing,

748
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,784
and pryin' into
other people's business is yours.

749
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,501
So why can't I do mine without being
bugged all the time about it?

750
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,041
Your father's crying, maxie.

751
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,466
What do you think about that?

752
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,759
Hmm.

753
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,053
I didn't think he could.

754
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,720
Now, look...

755
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,061
Look, about this afternoon. I.

756
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,943
- Gerrie, I'd like to say one thing.
- You don't have to say anything.

757
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,361
Damn it, yes, I do.

758
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,190
- You can cry if you want to.
- I'm not going to cry.

759
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,490
Well, whatever you feel like.

760
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,410
You must know that it wasn't
anything you did or didn't do.

761
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,952
- Please, stop it.
- Well, it was...

762
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,905
It was just a weakness on my part,

763
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,333
some kind of a damned
no-good streak of...

764
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,910
Gerrie, nobody ever got close.

765
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,462
It was no closeness
or anything like that.

766
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,212
It was plain, irresponsible
animal instincts.

767
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,589
And one other thing,

768
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,217
I always felt... no, two things.

769
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,470
I always felt ashamed every time,

770
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,177
and I'm ashamed now.
That's... that's one thing.

771
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,354
And the other thing is...

772
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,567
The other thing is,

773
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,782
I'll never do it again.

774
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,406
I smoke too much.

775
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,579
I don't give a damn
what the inventory says, you...

776
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:08,006
- Arthur.
- I'm in a big hurry, della.

777
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,135
Arthur!

778
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,095
Man on radio:
And then, to lift them out,

779
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:18,267
raise the heat about 380, 480,

780
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,224
nearly up to 500
degrees fahrenheit.

781
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,180
You've been acting funny all day.

782
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,187
Della, I'm due at
dr margolin's office.

783
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,320
Art, go check warehouse three,

784
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,614
see how many three-quarter-ton units
we have on hand.

785
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,237
I've got four trucks waiting for
this shipment right now.

786
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,364
Are you mad at me about something?

787
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,282
Della, gerrie knows about us.

788
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,868
Look, now, I'm not firing you.
I still want you to work here,

789
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,703
but the rest of it...

790
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,462
Better not try to treat me
like an old kleenex, Arthur.

791
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,385
I... I can't talk to you now, della.

792
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,180
Answer it, bastard.

793
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,970
Well, just look how old they are.

794
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,898
I mean, how would you like
to have folks that old, huh?

795
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,516
I just hate 'em, that's all.

796
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,645
I mean, it's dumb for two old people
like them to have a baby.

797
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,196
What would they
wanna have a baby for?

798
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,115
I mean, my mother was
forty-five years old,

799
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,113
and my father was sixty,

800
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,904
and look what they got. Me!

801
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,997
Look how I look.

802
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,042
Why couldn't you think of the kid
before you started havin' a kid?

803
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,689
Why couldn't they just say,
"okay, okay,

804
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,916
"we're too old to have a baby"?

805
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,999
But my father.
He's gotta go and prove

806
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,301
he can have a kid.
All for his own ego.

807
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,717
Well, I hate both of 'em.
I wish they would just die.

808
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,514
I wish I would die.

809
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,226
When I was still tryin' to
graduate high school,

810
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,226
before I even realised
what a dumb brain they'd given me

811
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,103
with their old beat-up bodies.

812
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,796
I used to hate it when they'd
come over to the school

813
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,731
and I'd try and avoid
being anywhere near them.

814
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,562
Sorry, little problem on the job.

815
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,524
I told everybody they were
really my grandparents.

816
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,530
Well, look at 'em!

817
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,282
Look at 'em, they're disgusting!

818
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,725
I mean, how would you
like to be a kid,

819
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,910
tryin' to... tryin' to play baseball,
and have a father

820
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,992
that's eighty years old?

821
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,202
I hate him.

822
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,125
You know, I... I hate you.

823
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,047
You are a shit!

824
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,171
Why don't you just go away
someplace, and... and die?

825
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,548
Just die.

826
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,048
Well...

827
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,761
Who has a comment
on Wally's statement?

828
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:31,859
Nobody?

829
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,778
Well, surely somebody
has something to say?

830
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,942
Yes, I do.

831
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,973
- You've got no right...
- I don't wanna listen to you again.

832
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,100
- You sit there and talk to...
- You know, he's got a comment on everything,

833
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,332
and he doesn't know
anything about anything.

834
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,501
- But, do...
- But he's just told me...

835
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,295
Do you have a comment, maxie?

836
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,623
Yes, I do.

837
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,504
You don't mind, do you?
Ladies first?

838
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,880
Go ahead, maxie.

839
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,805
Well, first of all, the more
I come to these gross things,

840
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,722
the less I know why I'm here.

841
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,847
I mean, these meetings
are really gross.

842
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,888
Well, these group sessions
might get a bit

843
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,473
gross sometimes.

844
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,897
This, um...

845
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,688
This person over here, this...
This Wally guy,

846
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,816
he just wastes our time.
He's a nut.

847
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:24,403
What about this sweet big baby?

848
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,322
Big authority on every subject.

849
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,578
Well, he makes me sick.

850
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,159
You all make me sick.

851
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,585
If I had some acid, I'd...

852
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,162
I'd drop it right here,
right now.

853
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,122
- "Drop it"?
- It means "take it".

854
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,258
D'you see what I mean? Well...

855
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,137
I don't wanna come back
here anymore.

856
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,057
- What do you want, maxie?
- Out. I want out.

857
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,217
Of our world, you mean?

858
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,271
Yes, I'm gonna find a new reality.

859
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,689
- With drugs.
- Yup.

860
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,267
But let's think about this a moment.

861
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,944
Isn't running away
from the world as it is,

862
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,772
away from reality...

863
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,650
Isn't that a kind of death?

864
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,115
Well, what's so bad about death?

865
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,617
It'd get us out of this.

866
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,765
Party guest:
Hello, maxie. How are you?

867
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,355
Watch it.

868
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,782
Thank you. Excuse me.

869
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,993
D'you like that?

870
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,173
Hey, is this new?

871
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,509
- Where'd you get it?
- I bought it.

872
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,780
No! You know I can't drink.

873
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,903
Come on, it's a celebration,
sweetheart.

874
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,947
Look at her, dancing with
a boy with a haircut.

875
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,702
A boy who likes school.

876
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,585
All she needed was
a little wholesome family fun.

877
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,458
Come on, come on.

878
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,877
Arthur!

879
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,296
- Arthur... Arthur!
- No, let's go.

880
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,711
Beautiful!

881
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,248
How did I ever do that all night long?

882
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,167
What's that you're smoking?

883
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,635
Grass, man.

884
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,762
- You want some?
- Are you kiddin"?

885
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,840
Let me see that.

886
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,348
Hey, hey, what's the matter?
What did I do?

887
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,229
Woman:
What's... what's goin' on?

888
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,353
Hey, stop him!

889
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,197
- David: Break it up!
- Smokin' pot in my house!

890
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,324
You all right? Yes.

891
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,329
He's just a little, er...
Loaded, that's all.

892
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,961
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

893
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,551
You shouldn't have
been so mean, Arthur.

894
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,843
Well, maybe we all oughta try it.

895
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,204
I hear it doesn't give you
a hangover, the way Martinis do.

896
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,014
You're beautiful, Tina.

897
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,517
- We should think about going.
- Why? It's early.

898
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,722
Come on, let's go.

899
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:02,977
- Did I hurt you?
- No, man.

900
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,605
I hope not.
Good night, good night.

901
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,340
Well, we'll have to
say good night, Arthur.

902
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,446
- Yeah, I married a wet blanket.
- Good night, David.

903
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,398
- Thanks, Arthur.
- What's that, killjoy?

904
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,279
Oh! Tyre chains.

905
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,578
Sandy, Sandy, come thank
mr Mason for your tyre chains.

906
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,496
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, how much do I owe you?

907
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,619
- Forget it.
- No, no.

908
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,271
Hey, I really appreciate these,
mr Mason.

909
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,189
Here, let me have your keys.
I'll put 'em in your trunk for you.

910
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,607
Oh, don't be silly, mom,
I'll do it.

911
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,337
No, no, no.
You stay here and have fun.

912
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,425
- No.
- Yes, sir.

913
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,716
You haven't even
had your drink yet.

914
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,447
He thinks if he doesn't
drink his drink tonight,

915
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,007
maybe I'll let him have... bye!

916
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,409
Maybe I'll let him
have two tomorrow.

917
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,433
To tell you the truth, mom,
I really don't want it.

918
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,133
Now, sneaky, sneaky.

919
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,764
Let me have your keys.

920
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:43,063
Probably go off with some girl,
and get stuck in the snow.

921
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,814
Huh, would you believe that boy?

922
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,442
He's gonna marry that car someday.

923
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:59,447
Oh, well, he can marry
anything he wants.

924
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,749
As long as he's on the Dean's list,
we don't care, do we, smoochie?

925
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,593
Hi, there.

926
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:28,183
Arthur:
J old man trouble, I don't need you

927
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,985
j I just want you to
stay away from my door

928
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,815
j just you stay away from my door

929
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,363
j now, I got rhythm

930
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,159
j I got music

931
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,495
j I've got my gal

932
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,573
j who could ask for anything more? J

933
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,122
she had a ball, sweetheart.
She had a real old-fashioned ball.

934
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,044
And so did you.

935
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,416
Arthur: Maxie!

936
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,629
Maxie!

937
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,051
Maxie!

938
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,519
Oh, maxie.

939
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,752
In my judgement, your daughter
has taken a large dose of stp.

940
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,675
Stp? Isn't that the one
that's so dangerous?

941
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,970
- Sweetheart...
- It can be, yes.

942
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,797
We have no antidote for stp.

943
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,757
We can just try to keep
the person quiet

944
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,843
and wait till it wears off.

945
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,396
I suggest you go home
and try to get some rest.

946
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,767
Doctor...

947
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,068
Come back at ten o'clock.

948
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,817
Yes, but...

949
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,363
Why do you suppose Sandy
wouldn't let me have

950
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,423
the keys to his car?

951
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,017
David?

952
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,761
Tina, for Pete's sake!

953
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,769
Those diet pills are
making you downright kooky.

954
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,601
I'm sorry.

955
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,029
David: You had enough to drink
to put a horse to sleep,

956
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,778
and now look at ya.

957
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,529
Tina: I can't help it.

958
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,063
What are you doing with this?

959
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,606
What do you think?

960
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,392
I'm selling it.

961
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,038
David...

962
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:37,826
Now, look.

963
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,832
The kids are taking this stuff.

964
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,380
I mean, not me,
but a lot of the others.

965
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,798
Maxie got it from you.

966
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,613
Sandy: Well, they gotta buy it
from somebody, right?

967
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,502
So, why not me?

968
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:51,431
Besides, do you think I can
get along and buy school clothes

969
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,850
on that lousy little allowance
you give me?

970
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:57,896
That lousy little allowance
is your father's life blood.

971
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,769
You get a kick outta
scrimping and saving.

972
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,224
You always have.

973
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,025
And how do you expect me
to buy gas,

974
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,104
to get back and forth
on the weekends?

975
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,530
And this is easy.
There's nothing to it.

976
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,107
Till you get arrested.

977
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,027
No, the cops almost look
the other way.

978
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,864
There's... there's so much of it,
they're embarrassed.

979
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,869
If they tried to bust
all the grass-heads,

980
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,076
they'd be putting
their own kids in jail.

981
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,749
Aren't you afraid that we
might have you arrested?

982
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,171
Sandy: I know you, pop.

983
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,044
I'm your fair-haired boy.

984
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,654
That's the biggest kick
you have in life,

985
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,293
telling everybody how great I am,

986
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,925
how I'm gonna be
a big lawyer someday.

987
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,926
And you're right. I am.

988
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:35,100
You wouldn't bust that up.
Not for anything.

989
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,471
You couldn't take it.

990
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,937
So, in a way, it's, er... lucky for me
that you found out.

991
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,937
Because, now that you know,
you'd be sort of...

992
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,268
Accomplices.

993
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,564
And I can keep the stuff
right here in the house.

994
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,621
I... I hate sneaking, anyhow.

995
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,108
I'm sorry.

996
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,110
Oh, wow.

997
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,986
I really am.
That you're so shook up, I mean.

998
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,755
No, David.
Not the police. Not now.

999
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,553
We have to have time to think.

1000
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,884
Somebody has to start somewhere.

1001
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,558
Police radio: 178 east 3rd street.
158 east 7th street.

1002
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,441
Sandy: It's a shame for you
to be wasting your time like this.

1003
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,739
That officer just violated my rights.

1004
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,821
They'll let me go immediately.

1005
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:20,162
As a citizen, I feel you could make
better use of your time

1006
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,457
- trying to catch criminals.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1007
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,461
Did they really have to send
four of you guys?

1008
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,637
We've sent for a peer
to come sit with her.

1009
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,981
- A peer?
- Yes, a peer, an equal.

1010
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,523
Someone, er... they feel they can trust.

1011
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,108
Someone not of the establishment,
if you will.

1012
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,318
And this peer helps us

1013
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,075
by talking them down, as we say.

1014
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,962
This is what they call
a psycho ward, isn't it?

1015
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,791
Yes, an unfortunate name.

1016
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:16,299
It's also unfortunate that,
for space and personnel reasons,

1017
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,300
we have to put a young girl
like your daughter

1018
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,382
in the same ward with...

1019
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,762
Dt cases,

1020
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:25,391
heroin addicts who have oded,
everything imaginable.

1021
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,892
Oh, just one word of warning.

1022
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,100
She may have an adverse reaction
to seeing you here.

1023
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,714
Arthur:
Well, maybe we shouldn't go in.

1024
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,274
No, no, I'd like to see her reaction,

1025
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,071
but don't be upset if she
doesn't seem glad to see you.

1026
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:37,532
Huh?

1027
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:41,115
Good morning.

1028
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,630
- Hi, doctor.
- Morning, Jennifer.

1029
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,630
I wanted to ask one thing.

1030
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,966
Would it be all right if we
tried to talk to her,

1031
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:04,847
and tell her we were
wrong about something?

1032
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,553
Apologise, I mean.

1033
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,354
Do you think it would be all right?

1034
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,806
Try it, by all means.

1035
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,608
If she's receptive,
it could be a big help.

1036
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,152

Maxie.

1044
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,227
Maxie, we...

1045
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,056
We found out about Sandy.

1046
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:54,566
He admitted it
to his mother and father.

1047
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,021
We want to apologise for...

1048
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,323
For accusing your brother.

1049
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:03,114
We know how much you love him...

1050
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,211
Arthur!

1051
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:24,009
Get dr Salazar! Get the key!

1052
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,467
- Arthur: He's coming.
- Get me out! Get me out!

1053
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,814
Hey, mom. Artie!

1054
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,142
I've gotta get out of here.

1055
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:49,163
I heard she flipped out
pretty bad.

1056
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,411
So you're the, er...
Whatchamacallit, huh?

1057
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,787
The... the peer?

1058
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,165
They said she asked for me.

1059
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:58,339
I made a pretty bad mistake
about you, Artie.

1060
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,836
That's life.

1061
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,672
Help her get better.

1062
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,716
I'll try.

1063
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,016
Doctor.

1064
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,032
Maxie.

1065
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,985
Maxie.

1066
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,556
I'm gonna fix you a dinner
you won't soon forget.

1067
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,053
I can fix dinner.

1068
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:35,262
You stay in that bed.
Complete rest.

1069
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,816
I'm not a bad cook, you know.

1070
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,777
I'm not.

1071
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,444
Yes, you are.

1072
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:09,804
Artie: Come on, maxie.
You can do it.

1073
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,301
Come on.

1074
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,475
Come on, now.

1075
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,473
Maxie?

1076
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,485
Okay, now you try it.

1077
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,119
Come on.

1078
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,025
Jesus, doc,

1079
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,113
that's rough work.

1080
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,789
I'll be back again soon, sis.

1081
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:51,941
Your brother says you are rough work,
and you are, you know?

1082
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,528
Ach!

1083
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,951
Maybe we should walk you
around outside for a while.

1084
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,626
It's a beautiful...

1085
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,566
You like it?

1086
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,526
Yes, it's very nice.

1087
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,615
Honest and truly?

1088
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,038
Honest.

1089
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,545
It's yours.

1090
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,375
You can have these, too.
I hate 'em.

1091
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,795
You hate 'em?

1092
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,596
Hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em.

1093
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,804
Well, if you hate 'em,
why do 'em?

1094
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,354
To please dr Salazar.

1095
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,775
If I please dr Salazar,
he'll let me out of here.

1096
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,602
Oh, that'll be wonderful, baby.

1097
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,733
Maybe in time for your birthday?

1098
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,657
We both want you back home
with us so much.

1099
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,944
Oh, you do, huh?

1100
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,496
You're gonna be happy, baby.

1101
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,617
Things are getting back to...
Well, together again.

1102
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:28,544
Artie drops by more,
a lot more, the last couple of weeks.

1103
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,622
- And your mom and me...
- She's still in bed?

1104
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,547
- Well, she's...
- She's chicken.

1105
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,375
I hate chicken people.

1106
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,385
But... but...

1107
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,717
I wanna come home. I really do.

1108
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,800
I mean, if dr Salazar
ever thought that I...

1109
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,101
That I didn't want to come home,
why...

1110
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,429
Why, then he'd never let me
out of here.

1111
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,854
Daddy...

1112
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:57,235
- You like this?
- Very much.

1113
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,487
It's just the same as this one.

1114
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:01,986
Daddy,

1115
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,239
do you think they're good?

1116
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,698
I mean...

1117
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,158
Really good?

1118
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,834
Well, I think they're good.

1119
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,412
I mean, I'm not...
I'm not an art critic, but I...

1120
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,839
I think they show talent, yes.

1121
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,962
You really like to lie a lot,
don't you, daddy?

1122
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,378
I only...

1123
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,009
See why I don't wanna come home?

1124
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,056
Lies, lies, lies!

1125
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,596
Oh, daddy, don't tell dr Salazar
I said that.

1126
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,480
Please, please,
I do wanna come home.

1127
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,854
- Don't tell him, daddy, please.
- I won't.

1128
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,530
Anyway, really, I do wanna come home
and be with you and mom.

1129
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,278
That'd be wonderful, baby.
Just wonderful.

1130
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,945
I do, I do, I do...

1131
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,325
I do.

1132
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,365
I do.

1133
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,500
Daddy...

1134
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:53,212
Why do you want me to come home?

1135
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,882
Why?

1136
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,265
Because we love you, that's why.

1137
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:12,644
Liar, liar.

1138
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,985
- Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar!
- Maxie, please don't.

1139
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,072
- I'm sorry.
- Liar!

1140
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,550
- I didn't mean to get you upset.
- Liar!

1141
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,905
Don't, maxie, please!

1142
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,483
Orderly: Enough, maxie.
That's enough.

1143
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,952
I'm sorry, I... I won't be able
to see you next week.

1144
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:26,779
I'll be outta town.

1145
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,489
But your mother can call.

1146
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,825
- Tell her not to bother.
- She's not allowed out of bed.

1147
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,662
Maxie: Go away, please! Go away!

1148
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,873
I'll... I'll see you in about
ten days, baby.

1149
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,471
He just gets me uptight.

1150
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,681
I have a right to get uptight,
just like anybody else.

1151
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,442
It doesn't mean there's
anything wrong with me.

1152
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,570
Arthur, does this stuff
have to be done on a Sunday?

1153
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:06,118
'Course it has to be done.
I told ya.

1154
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,286
I mean, why me?

1155
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,996
Whaddaya mean, "why me?"

1156
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,826
Who else could I get who knows
about air condition specifications

1157
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,660
at this late date?

1158
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,795
Nobody, I guess.

1159
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,873
What the hell's the matter with you?

1160
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,504
And what are you all
dressed up for?

1161
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,175
I always dress up on Sunday.

1162
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:25,221
Arthur, is it really true
that you expected Rafferty

1163
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,595
to okay the new specs on this city job,
and he finked out on you?

1164
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:31,268
You get to know somebody,
you'd think they'd bend a little.

1165
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:34,313
And if I don't reach the nine A.M.
deadline tomorrow

1166
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,608
- with these new specs...
- They'd cancel the contract.

1167
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,276
And you'd lose?

1168
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,820
This is the biggest job
I ever figured, della.

1169
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:46,776
By my calculations, you'll lose about
seventeen hundred dollars expenditures

1170
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:49,237
and about ten thousand dollars
expected profits.

1171
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,738
That's right.

1172
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,573
I quit, Arthur.

1173
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,749
As of now.

1174
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,591
You're kiddin"!

1175
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,719
Ta-ta.

1176
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,593
Della, you can't do this!

1177
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,053
Wanna bet?

1178
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,979
Not at a time like this.

1179
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:20,359
A time like this is what
I've been waiting for, Arthur.

1180
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,544
Well, how are we doing?

1181
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,832
She won't talk to me.

1182
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,542
Maybe next time.

1183
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,295
So long, doctor.

1184
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,936
I want out of here,

1185
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:02,484
and I don't wanna
go back with them.

1186
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,320
And I don't see why I have to
wait till I'm eighteen.

1187
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,023
Kids know a lot more than they used to
when that law was made.

1188
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:10,609
- About some things.
- About everything.

1189
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,286
Anyway, about important things.

1190
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:16,241
Is self-preservation
an important thing?

1191
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,081
That's a trick question,
and I'm not going to answer it.

1192
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,662
All right.

1193
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,339
Let's suppose your parents
let you go free right now,

1194
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:25,916
be on your own.

1195
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,156
They might as well.
In fourteen months, when I'm eighteen,

1196
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,091
I'm gonna do it anyhow,
so they might as well.

1197
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:33,094
All right, let's suppose they do.
What would you do?

1198
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,642
I mean, how would you
arrange your life?

1199
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,936
Well...

1200
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:42,061
First, I'd take a long trip
with my boyfriend.

1201
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:45,728
- Why a long one?
- Because I never had a long one.

1202
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:48,235
I never had enough bread
for that much stuff.

1203
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,691
What would you call "a long trip"?

1204
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,367
About a week.

1205
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,890
But if you didn't
have the money before,

1206
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,121
how would you expect
to have it now?

1207
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,699
I don't know. Somehow.

1208
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,167
What else would you
like to talk about?

1209
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,214
When do I get out of here?

1210
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,801
We're working on that.

1211
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,353
On.

1212
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:30,155
I talked to her again
this afternoon. She's...

1213
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,984
Still on the other side
of a stone wall.

1214
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,287
But she has improved.

1215
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,948
Dr Salazar said that.

1216
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,875
"Steady improvement."

1217
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,874
- That's what he said, isn't it?
- That's right.

1218
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,001
And I told him
you were up for a while today,

1219
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:51,131
and he said he was sure you'd
snap back just fine, sweetheart.

1220
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:55,264
Sometimes you wonder
if you want to snap back.

1221
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,309
Does he know yet...

1222
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:03,601
Can he estimate how much longer
she'll have to be in this...

1223
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,979
What a hideous way of saying it.

1224
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,357
This "controlled environment"?

1225
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,030
No, no.
I asked him the same thing.

1226
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,732
It just depends. They...

1227
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:17,035
They have no way of knowing
until they have more time.

1228
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:22,701
But what really bugs me is
it all boils down to money.

1229
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:27,747
I guess everything does,
sooner or later.

1230
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,718
They've got these private hospitals
where they get the best possible care,

1231
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:36,013
where they have about
two staff members per patient,

1232
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,012
plenty of therapy,
everything of the best.

1233
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,764
Well, that's where
maxie's got to be.

1234
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,310
Yeah, that's what I said.

1235
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:45,140
But these places run from about...

1236
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:47,812
Are you ready for this?

1237
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,523
Twenty-five to forty thousand a year.

1238
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:53,939
- Twenty-five?
- To forty thousand a year.

1239
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:57,242
- But nobody can afford that.
- We can't, that's a cinch.

1240
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,739
Well, what else is there?

1241
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:01,447
After that, it just drops way off.

1242
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,533
You...
You get into the public places.

1243
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,980
And the worst part of it is,
they don't really have a place

1244
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,838
just specifically for this kinda thing
in most municipal institutions.

1245
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:13,592
I mean, she'd be
in with addicts, ya know,

1246
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,920
heroin addicts, schizophrenes...

1247
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:19,506
Well, that's impossible.
We can't put her in anything like that.

1248
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,932
I know.

1249
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:28,107
Arthur, are they sure?

1250
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,731
I mean, couldn't we try it
just once more at home?

1251
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:36,111
Three specialists talked to her
and they all recommended against it.

1252
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:42,034
They all agree she has
very strong self-destructive urges.

1253
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,325
Well, couldn't we put her in
one of these expensive places,

1254
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:48,752
just for six months?
We could afford six months.

1255
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,960
Arthur, you're not telling me
everything they said.

1256
01:22:55,721 --> 01:23:00,306
Sweetheart, they think she may be
in need of this controlled environment...

1257
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,007
Indefinitely.

1258
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,309
You don't mean for
the rest of her life?

1259
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:05,977
It's possible.

1260
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:10,391
I asked them what would happen
if we just let her go free,

1261
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:14,525
and they said she'd probably
destroy herself eventually.

1262
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,568
I said,
well, the way I feel now,

1263
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,445
instead of burying her
in some institution,

1264
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,777
I'd just as soon let her go out
and drug herself to death

1265
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:24,363
the way she wants to,
and then bury her.

1266
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,337
But that'd be quitting,

1267
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,460
and we're not gonna quit.

1268
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,837
No, no, sir. There's a way.

1269
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:39,591
There's a good chance
she can get well.

1270
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,593
They said that.
They all agreed on that. That's...

1271
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,016
That's what we have to hang onto.

1272
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:51,856
Oh, come...
Come on, now, sweetheart.

1273
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,310
Sweetheart, you know
what Salazar said?

1274
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,900
He said she doesn't
really hate us at all.

1275
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,357
The way he explained it is, she's
grown old enough to see our faults,

1276
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,740
but just not mature enough yet
to forgive them.

1277
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:07,535
Look, try not to
think about it, sweetheart.

1278
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,624
Do you want anything?

1279
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,458
Maybe you oughta
take a nap before dinner.

1280
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:15,915
That's it!

1281
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,335
Wait till you see
what I've got you for dinner.

1282
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:22,011
Artie's coming to dinner too,
ya know.

1283
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:24,260
Come on, now. You take a nap.

1284
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,810
I'm coming.

1285
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,528
Coming.

1286
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,648
- David: Arthur, hi.
- Oh, David.

1287
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:26,781
- Can I come in?
- Oh, please, come on, come on in, yes.

1288
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,784
Well, Arthur, you know
Sandy's been out on bail,

1289
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,536
and we've been waiting
for a trial date...

1290
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:33,813
I know you and Tina have
suffered through this thing, too.

1291
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,169
Yeah, well, listen,
we just got word, er...

1292
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,167
I want you to try to
be calm, Arthur.

1293
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:41,466
We just got word that
the charges have been dropped.

1294
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:42,793
- Some, er...
- Dropped?

1295
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,424
Yes, technicalities,

1296
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:46,909
- illegal search and seizure.
- You mean, no punishment at all?

1297
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,253
Now, I know how you feel, Arthur.

1298
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,750
I've been very upset about
this thing, too, for you. Listen...

1299
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,560
- No! No!
- Now, wait a minute.

1300
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,263
Wait a minute, Arthur!

1301
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,277
- Get outta that car!
- Sandy: Mr Mason! Hey! Help!

1302
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:02,775
My daughter's in an institution,

1303
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,666
and you think you'll
walk around free? No! No!

1304
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:06,734
No! By god, no!

1305
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:10,787
He's... he's crazy! Crazy!
He's going crazy!

1306
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,032
Arthur! Arthur!

1307
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:15,833
- Arthur: No, we'll see if you...
- Dad!

1308
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,287
Dad! Come on, dad, come on.

1309
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,485
That's not gonna do anybody any good.
I'll kill him!

1310
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,545
I'll kill him, the cunt! Your...

1311
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:25,048
Sandy: You heard him.
He tried to kill me!

1312
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:26,928
You're my witnesses.

1313
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,427
I'm calling the police,
and he's going to be arrested.

1314
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:31,304
I know my rights!

1315
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:35,679
I have always thought of myself
as incapable of violence,

1316
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:38,732
but if you make one more
obscene sound about your rights,

1317
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,276
you pollution of my life,
I shall hurt you.

1318
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,025
- I shall hurt you.
- Arthur: Come on, let go, now.

1319
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:46,774
Tell him I'll break his back!

1320
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,154
All right, I'm all right now.
Let's go.

1321
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:52,863
God, I hope your mother didn't hear.

1322
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,370
- Christ, I really blew!
- As only you can.

1323
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,202
Slimy little bastard.
"Case dismissed."

1324
01:26:58,296 --> 01:26:59,786
Poor David, with a kid like that.

1325
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,917
Christ, he's sicker than...

1326
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:03,589
Well, you're here!

1327
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,488
- I bought some Chinese food for dinner.
- Yeah.

1328
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,128
Lobster cantonese, "flied lice",
the whole deal.

1329
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,383
- Whaddaya say?
- Well, great!

1330
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:10,764
Good.

1331
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,967
Sweetheart, we've got a guest!

1332
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,435
Where is she? She's probably
in the bathroom, primping.

1333
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:17,387
She can get up
for a few minutes now.

1334
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,438
I could use a drink.
How about you?

1335
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:21,357
- Well...
- You know, I don't think

1336
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:24,858
we've ever had a drink together,
just the two of us, in all our lives.

1337
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:26,688
- Whaddaya say?
- Yeah, okay.

1338
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:29,387
I don't... you know, I don't remember
who told me this, but he said that,

1339
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:32,528
"if you're drinking for pleasure,
you sip it,

1340
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:35,329
"but if you really need a drink,
that's business,

1341
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:38,409
- "and you never waste time in business."
- That's right.

1342
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,840
What are you gonna do with yours?
Well...

1343
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,791
Come on, come on,
don't hesitate.

1344
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:48,343
He who does is lost.

1345
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:51,012
Down the hatch, that's it.

1346
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:55,926
There, doesn't that make you
feel better?

1347
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,977
Now, let's go up and see your mom.
Come on.

1348
01:27:58,064 --> 01:27:59,876
I told her about all the offers
you were getting,

1349
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,356
and she was very proud.

1350
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,354
Just goes to show you
what I know about music.

1351
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:04,730
Nothing.

1352
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,062
Listen, Artie, don't say anything
to your mother

1353
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:09,944
about the lobster cantonese.
I wanna surprise her.

1354
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,109
Sweetheart?

1355
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:15,658
Gerrie?

1356
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,955
She's not here.

1357
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:40,725
Good evening.
I'm mrs Mason, maxie's mother.

1358
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,398
Oh, I'm afraid visiting hours
are over, mrs Mason.

1359
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,350
Dr Salazar said it was all right.

1360
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,776
Well, there must be some mistake.

1361
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:49,900
- He never does that.
- No, no, it's a special thing.

1362
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,570
Well, if you don't mind,
I've gotta call him.

1363
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,867
Gerrie: Well, he's not at home.

1364
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:57,116
My husband and I just had
dinner with them,

1365
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:59,539
and they went on to a movie.

1366
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,163
Mrs Mason, I can't do it
without his consent.

1367
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:03,994
I'll take full responsibility.

1368
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,045
After all, I am her mother.

1369
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,713
You see, it's a...

1370
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:11,214
It's an experiment
in reality therapy.

1371
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:14,387
- "Reality therapy"?
- Yes, that's correct.

1372
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:19,639
- Well, I suppose...
- I'll go get her for you, mrs Mason.

1373
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:22,516
You can wait in the waiting room
there, mrs Mason.

1374
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,176
Maxie.

1375
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:14,652
It's all right, maxie.

1376
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:27,661
You've been refusing my calls.

1377
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:32,712
Your father tells me you won't speak
to him when he comes here.

1378
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:36,173
That's your way of punishing us.

1379
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,138
All right, I don't blame you.

1380
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:40,912
They're going to let you
out of here pretty soon.

1381
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:44,019
You'll be on your own.
Free, totally free.

1382
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,309
At least, that's what you think.

1383
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,599
But I know the truth.

1384
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:53,403
The truth is that you're
going to be here forever.

1385
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,402
Oh, not here, because they can't
keep you here much longer,

1386
01:30:56,493 --> 01:31:00,657
and not in one of those luxury places
for twenty-five thousand dollars a year,

1387
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,863
because we can't afford that.

1388
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,997
Finally, there's something, finally,
that we can't afford to give you.

1389
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:10,413
You don't see
the humour in that, do you?

1390
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:12,793
Well, neither do I.

1391
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,795
So they're going to
keep you some place,

1392
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:18,845
some not very nice place,
I'm afraid, forever.

1393
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:22,891
Or, if not forever,
for a very long time.

1394
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:26,679
Do you know why? Do you?

1395
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:28,813
No?

1396
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:30,811
Then I'll tell you.

1397
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,894
Because you'd rather
punish us for being human

1398
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,071
than try to get well.

1399
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:38,957
Because you're still a big baby,
and if the game's not played your way,

1400
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,491
you're not gonna play at all.

1401
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:43,365
Well, I'm here to tell you that
you're not gonna get away with it.

1402
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:47,699
I'm telling you, as your mother,
that you are going to survive.

1403
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:54,001
You're going to speak to me,
and you're going to survive.

1404
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,049
Now, turn around here,
and look at me.

1405
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:59,378
I said, "look at me"!

1406
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:03,924
Now, tell me you're going to get well.

1407
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,300
Say it!

1408
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:06,802
Say it!

1409
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,849
Say you'll try.

1410
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:12,015
Say it!

1411
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:14,066
Say it!

1412
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:17,191
- Say you'll try. Say it!
- Gerrie! Gerrie!

1413
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:20,281
J winds of change, they call my name &

1414
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,404
orderly: Let's go, maxie.

1415
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,281
J and beckon, "come"

1416
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:28,866
j just like a moth to a flame

1417
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:37,591
j and wherein lies the wonderwheel?

1418
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:47,017
- &' we've all been structured how to feel &
- Gerrie, listen to me, will you? Gerrie...

1419
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:52,101
J oh, mama

1420
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:55,896
