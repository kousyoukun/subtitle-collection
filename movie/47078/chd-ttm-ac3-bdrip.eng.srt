I never knew the old Vienna before the war...

2
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,730
with its Strauss music,
its glamour and easy charm.

3
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,470
Constantinople suited me better.

4
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,980
I really got to know it in
the classic period of the black market.

5
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,010
We'd run anything if people wanted it
enough and had the money to pay.

6
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,950
Of course, a situation like that
does tempt amateurs...

7
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,140
but, well, they-you know,
they can't stay the course like a professional.

8
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,450
Now the city, it's divided
into four zones, you know...

9
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,250
each occupied by a power- the American,
the British, the Russian and the French.

10
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,790
But the center of the city,
that's international...

11
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,800
policed by an international patrol,
one member of each of the four powers.

12
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,460
Wonderfull What a hope they had,
all strangers to the place...

13
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,830
and none of them
could speak the same language...

14
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,130
except a sort of smattering
of German.

15
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,510
Good fellows, on the whole.
Did their best, you know.

16
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,640
Vienna doesn't really look any worse than a lot
of other European cities. Bombed about a bit.

17
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,840
Oh, I was gonna tell you- Wait.
I was gonna tell you about Holly Martins...

here to visit a friend ofhis.

The name was Lime.
Harry Lime.

20

Now, Martins was broke, and Lime had offered
him -I don't know-some sort of a job.

21
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,830
Anyway, there he was, poor chap,
happy as a lark and without a cent.

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,310
Austrians aren't allowed
in your hotel.

151
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,040
- Couldrt we meet at the Mozart Caf'e?
- Where?

152
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,050
- Just around the corner.
- How will I know you?

153
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,320
I'll carry a copy of one of your books.
Harry gave it to me.

154
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,020
Be there in a moment.
Wait a minute.

155
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,750
If I do this lecture business,
you'll put me up here a while?

156
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,760
- Certainly.
- It's a deal.

157
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,920
- Ever read a book of mine
called The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?
- No, not that one.

158
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,400
It's a story about a man who hunted down
a sheriff who was victimizing his best friend.

159
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,400
- Seems exciting.
- It is.

160
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,670
I'm gunning just the same way
for your Major Callaghan.

161
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,770
Sounds anti-British, sir.

162
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,960
- Baron Kurtz?
- Mr. Martins?

163
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,500
Delighted to meet you.
Come, let's sit down here.

164
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,530
[Speaking German]

165
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,330
- What would you like? Tea? Coffee?
- Coffee.

166
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,830
[Speaking German]

167
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,460
It's wonderful how
you keep the tension.

168
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,170
- Tension?
- Suspense.

169
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,680
- You really liked it?
- At the end of every chapter you are left guessing
what he'll be up to next.

170
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,010
So, you were a friend of Harry's?

171
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,360
I think his best.
Except you, of course.

172
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,260
The police have a crazy notion that he
was mixed up in some sort of a racket.

173
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,700
Everyone in Vienna is. We all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing.

174
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,710
I tell you, I've done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war.

175
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,710
Once when I was hard up,
I sold some tires on the black market.

176
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,610
I wonder what my father
would have said.

177
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,180
- I'm afraid the police meant more than that.
- They get rather absurd ideas sometimes.

178
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,050
He's somewhere now
he won't mind about that.

179
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
Even so, I'm not going to leave it at this.

180
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,560
Will you help me?

181
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,300
I wish I could.
But, you know, I am an Austrian.

182
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,430
I have to be
careful with the police.

183
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,530
I'm afraid I can't help you.

184
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,980
Except with advice, of course.

185
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,980
Advice.

186
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,790
We came out of his place
like this...

187
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,480
and were walking this way.

188
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,720
A friend of his called to him
from over there.

189
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,460
Harry went across, and
from up there came the truck.

190
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,540
It was just about here.

191
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,640
- Here?
- Yes.

192
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,340
His friend and I picked him up...

193
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,620
- carried him across over here.
- [Car Horn Honks]

194
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,020
It was a terrible thing. Terrible.

195
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,490
We laid him down just about here.

196
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,700
And this is where he died.

197
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,930
Even at the end,
his thoughts were of you.

198
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
What did he say?

199
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,270
I can't remember
the exact words, Holly.

200
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,140
- I may call you Holly, mayrt I?
He always called you that to us.
- [Dog Whimpers]

201
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,210
He was anxious I should
look after you when you arrived...

202
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,940
to see that you got safely home,
tickets, you know, and all that.

203
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,950
But he said he died instantaneously.

204
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,380
Well, he died before
the ambulance could reach us.

205
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,260
Well, there was only you and this, uh -
this friend of his. Uh, who was he?

206
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,660
A Romanian. Mr. Ropescu.

207
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,900
- I'd like to talk to him.
- H-He has left Vienna.

208
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,170
[Dog Whimpering]

209
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,470
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

210
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,640
- Did you know Mr. Lime well?
- Mr. Lime? Yes.

211
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,560
- You remember me. U-Upstairs.
- Yes, I remember you.

212
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,930
Who used to visit Mr. Lime?

213
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,090
Visit? Eh -

215
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,380
- What did he say?
- He says he doesn't know everybody.

Excuse me.

219
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,060
Who was at the funeral besides you?

220
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,790
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

221
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,230
Wasrt there a girl there?

222
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:09,500
Some girl of theJosefstadt Theater.
You know what Harry was.

223
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,570
You oughtrt to speak to her.
It would only cause her pain.

224
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,740
Not necessarily.
She'd probably want to help.

225
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,540
What's the good
of another postmortem?

226
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,380
Suppose you dig up something,
well, discreditable to Harry?

227
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,720
- Would you give me your address?
- I live in the Russian sector.

228
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,450
But you'll find me at
the Casanova Club every night.

229
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,050
One has to work the best way
one can, you know.

230
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,560
- What's the name of this girl?
- I don't know.

231
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,720
I don't think I ever heard it.

232
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,740
You did mention the theater.

233
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,970
Josefstadt.

234
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,520
But I still think
it won't do Harry any good.

235
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,420
You'd do better
to think of yourself.

236
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,290
[Chuckles]
I'll be all right.

237
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,990
Of course.
I'm so glad I've met you.

238
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,390

Such a good cover, I think.

- Number 8, please.
- Major Calloway's compliments, sir.

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,440
- Here's the ticket for the plane tomorrow.
- Tell the major I won't need it.

241

Oh, porter, order me a ticket tonight
for theJosefstadt Theater.

- Ah, Mr. Martinsl
- Good evening, Mr. Crabbin.

243

He said I was to drive you to the airfield
or take you to the bus, whichever you prefer.

244

Didrt you hear Mr. Crabbin offer me

- No, I - Excuse me. I could follow it fine.

- Oh, yes.
- Perhaps Harry told you about me.
My name is Holly Martins.

259
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,490
- No, he never told me about his friends.
- Oh.

260
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,510
- Would you like some tea?
- Thank you.

Someone threw me this packet last week.

Sometimes the British do instead of
flowers, you know, on the first night.

263

That was a bouquet from an American.
Would you rather have whiskey?

- Oh, tea's fine.
- Good. I wanted to sell it.

- Oh, there is some tea left.
- Had you known him some time?

- Yes.
- I wanted to talk to you - No, thank you.

There's nothing really to talk about,
is there? Nothing.

269
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,230
Well, I saw you at the funeral.

270
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm so sorry.
I didn't notice much.

You were in love with him,

I don't know. How can you know
a thing like that afterwards?

I don't know anything anymore,
except I want to be dead too.

No. No tea.

Oh, American.
Thank you. I like them.

I was talking to another friend
of Harry's, a Baron Kurtz.

- Do you know him?
- No.

279

- He's got a little dog.
- Oh, yes, yes.

280
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,580
Don't understand what Harry saw
in a fellow like that.

281
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,850
That was the man who brought me
some money when Harry died.

282
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,190
He said Harry had been
anxious at the last moment.

283
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Hmm.
He said he remembered me too.

284
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,790
Seems to show
he wasrt in much pain.

285
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,140
Dr. Winkel told me that.

286
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,870
Dr. Winkel?
Who's he?

287
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,640
A doctor Harry used to go to.
He was passing just after it happened.

288
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,080
- His own doctor?
- Yes.

289
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,520
Well, were you at the inquest?

290
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,520
Yes. They said it wasrt
the driver's fault.

291
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,530
Harry had often said what
a careful driver he was.

292
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,530
- He was Harry's driver?
- Mm-hmm.

Well, uh, I don't get it.

No strangers there at all.

298
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,670
I know. I've wondered
about it a hundred times...

299
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,250
if it really was an accident.

300
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,320

Yes. Would you mind, Mr., uh -

- Martins, coming to the point, please?

465
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,510
- Thank you.
- I have guests waiting.

466
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,180
- We were both friends of Harry Lime.
- I was his medical adviser.

467
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,280
- I want to find out all I can.
- Find out?

468
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,360
- Hear the details.
- I can tell you very little.

469
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,520
He was run over by a car.
He was dead when I arrived.

470
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,400
- Who was with him?
- Two friends of his.

471
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,100
You sure? Two?

472
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,180
Quite sure.

473
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,440
Could he have been at all conscious?

474
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,410
I understand he was, yes,
for a short time...

475
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,920
while they carried him
across the road.

476
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,990
- In great pain?
- Mmm, not necessarily.

477
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,180
Could he have been capable
of making plans...

478
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:41,730
for me and others just-
just during those few moments?

479
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,730
I understand he left some
instructions before he died.

480
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,060
I cannot give an opinion.
I was not there.

481
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,500
My opinion is, uh,
limited to the causes of death.

482
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,280
Have you any reason
to be dissatisfied?

483
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,440
Was it possible that his death
might have been...

484
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,460
not accidental?

485
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,490
Could he have been-

486
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,700
Could he have been...

00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,380
The injuries to the head and skull
would have been the same.

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,220
Major, may I see you
for a moment, please?

Certainly, Brodsky.
What is it?

and we are interested in this case.

- No, not yet.

Please, keep this passport to yourself until
I will make some inquiries. Will you, Major?

We loved each other.
Do you mean that?

- No.

- He works in a military hospital.
- No.

It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt.
I'm in a position to help you.

I'm not lying.

You're wrong about Harry.
You're wrong about everything.

510

In one of his letters, he asked you to telephone
a good friend of his called Joseph.

511
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,270
He gave you the number
of the Casanova Club.

512
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,600
That's where a lot of friends
of Lime used to go.

- It wasrt important.
- What was the message?

Something about
meeting Harry at his home.

515
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,380
Harbin disappeared
the day you telephoned.

got everything upside down.

He and the baron
were on the sidewalk.

Oh, I don't know how you got that idea.
You'll find all about it in the police report.

There was just the two of us.
Me and the baron.

Who could have told you
a story like that?

00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:11,030
The porter at Harry's place.
He was cleaning the window at the time.

589
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,040
And saw the accident?

590
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,020
No, he didn't see the accident,
but he saw three men carrying the body.

Why wasrt he at the police inquiry?

He doesn't want to get involved.

You'll never teach these
Austrians to be good citizens.

It was his duty
to give the evidence.

Even so, he remembers wrong.

596

What else did he tell you?

That Harry was dead before
you got him to that statue.

He probably knows
a lot more than that.

- Hmm, not necessarily.

mixed up in some, uh, racket?

Oh, that's quite impossible.
He had a great sense of duty.

602
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,610
Your friend Kurtz seems
to think it was possible.

I understand how an Anglo-Saxon feels.
The baron hasn't traveled, you know?

He seems to have been around a bit.

605
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,830
Do you know a man
called, uh, Harbin?

606
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,760
- No.
- Joseph Harbin.

607
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,060
Joseph Harbin? No.

608
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,570
That's a nice girl, that,
but she ought to go careful in Vienna.

609
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,470
Everybody ought to go careful
in a city like this.

610
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,010
He will meet us at the bridge. Good.

611
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,860
Hellol
Is it so very important for you?

612
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,460
- Yes, it is.
- I am not a bad man.

613
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,840
I'd like to tell you something.

614
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,840
Tell me, how did the car-

615
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,040
Shh, shh. Come tonight.
My wife goes out.

616
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,510

Oh, yes, yes. Come in.

620
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,540
The porter's going
to talk to us tonight.

621

Need we go through it all again?

622
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,310
I can manage by myself.
You busy?

623
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,850
Just another part I've got to learn.

624
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,080
Can I hear you?

625
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,220
- In German?
- I can try.

626
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,920
- Is it comedy or tragedy?
- Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

627
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,430
- Do I, uh, read -
- Well, you read this.

Oh, let me see.
No, no, that's not the cue.

633
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,210
It means she has to sit down.

634
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,190
Well, uh, Frau Hausman-

635
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,990
No, no.

636
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,060
It's no good.

637
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,630
Bad day?

638
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,930
It's always bad around this time.

639
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,640
He used to look in around 6:00.

640
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,500
I've been frightened. I've been alone
without friends and money.

641
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,880
But I've never known
anything like this.

642
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,990
- Please talk. Tell me about him.
- Tell you what?

643
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,180
Oh, anything. Just talk.

644
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,670
Where did you see him last?
When? What did you do?

645
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh, we didn't make much sense.
We drank too much.

646
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,810
- Once he tried to steal my girl.
- Where is she?

647
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,850
Oh, that was nine years ago.

648
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,920
- Tell me more.
- [Clears Throat]

649
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,280
Well, it's very difficult.
You knew Harry.

650
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,020
We didn't do anything very amusing.

651
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,060
He just made everything
seem like such, uh, fun.

652
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,030
- Was he clever when he was a boy?
- I suppose so. He could fix anything.

653
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,960
- What sort of things?
- Oh, little things.

How to put your temperature up
before exam. The best crib.

How to avoid this and that.

656
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,470
He fixed my papers for me.

657
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:43,310
He heard the Russians were repatriating
people like me who came from Czechoslovakia.

658
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,510
He knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps.

659
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,140
Yeah.

660
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,280
When he was 14, he taught me
the three-card trick.

661
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,760
- That's growing up fast.
- He never grew up.

662
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,660
The world grew up
around him, that's all.

663
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,820
- And buried him.
- Anna.

664
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,060
- You'll fall in love again.
- Don't you see I don't want to?

665
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,070
I don't ever want to.

666
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,710
Come on out and have a drink.

667
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,290
Why did you say that?

668
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,820
Seemed like a good idea.

669
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,620
It was just what he used to say.

670
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,690
Well, uh, I didn't
learn that from him.

671
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,360
If we have to see the porter,
we'd better go.

672
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,530
What's the hurry? Can't we talk
quietly for a couple of minutes?

673
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,870

- A moment ago, you said you
didn't want to see the porter.

- We're both in it, Harry.
- Holly.

I'm so sorry.

00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,720
It's all right.
You might get my name right.

You know, you ought
to find yourself a girl.

678
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,650
His English is so very bad,
we'll let him talk German.

- Look.

- Yes.

Yes. It's called The Third Man.

Victims?
Don't be melodramatic.

1059
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,500
Tell me.

1060
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:02,410
Would you really feel any pity if one
of those dots stopped moving forever?

1061
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:05,680
If I offered you £20,000
for every dot that stopped...

1062
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:08,180
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

1063
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:12,280
Or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spend?

1064
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:15,290
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax -

1065
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:18,090
the only way
you can save money nowadays.

1066
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,630
- A lot of good your money will do you in jail.
- That jail's in another zone.

1067
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:25,630
There's no proof against me...

1068
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,640
besides you.

1069
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,110
I should be pretty easy
to get rid of.

1070
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,390
- Pretty easy.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

1071
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:45,330
I carry a gun.

1072
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:48,870
I don't think they'd look for a bullet
wound after you hit that ground.

1073
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:53,730
They dug up your coffin.

1074
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,480
And found Harbin?

1075
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,020
Mm-hmm.

1076
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,160
Pity.
[Chuckles] Holly.

1077
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:13,820
What fools we are
talking to each other this way...

1078
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:16,660
as though I'd do anything to you
or you to me.

1079
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,530
You're just a little mixed up
about things in general.

1080
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:23,370
Nobody thinks in terms
ofhuman beings.

1081
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:25,370
Governments don't.
Why should we?

1082
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:29,100
They talk about the people and the proletariat.
I talk about the suckers and the mugs.

1083
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:35,050
It's the same thing. They have their
five-year plans, and so have I.

1084
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:36,780
You used to believe in God.

1085
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,650
I still do believe in God, old man.

1086
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:45,490
I believe in God and mercy
and all that.

1087
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,930
But the dead are happier dead.

1088
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:51,090
They don't miss much here,
poor devils.

1089
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,700
What do you believe in?

1090
01:20:56,810 --> 01:21:00,250
Oh, if you ever get Anna out
of this mess, be kind to her.

1091
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,320
I think you'll find she's won'th it.

1092
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:05,480
I wish I'd asked you to bring me
some of these tablets from home.

1093
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:09,320
Holly, I'd like to cut you in,
old man.

1094
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:13,460
There's nobody left in Vienna I can really trust,
and we've always done everything together.

1095
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:16,930
When you make up your mind, send me a message.
I'll meet you anyplace, anytime.

1096
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,970
And when we do meet, old man,
it's you I want to see...

1097
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:22,200
not the police.

1098
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,210
Remember that, won't you?

1099
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:27,840
[Chuckling] And don't be so gloomy.
After all, it's not that awful.

1100
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,380
Remember what the fella said:

1101
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:35,110
In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias, they had
warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed...

1102
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,820
but they produced Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.

1103
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,290
In Switzerland,
they had brotherly love.

1104
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:45,890
They had 500 years of democracy
and peace, and what did that produce?

1105
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,760
The cuckoo clock.
So long, Holly.

1106
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,770
But look here, Martins.
You can always arrange to meet him at -

1107
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,400
at some little caf'e here
in the international zone.

1108
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,570
- Wouldrt work.
- We'll never get him in the Russian zone.

1109
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,450
Calloway, you expect too much.

1110
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:10,490
Oh, I know he deserves to hang.
You've proved your stuff...

1111
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:14,040
but 20 years is a long time.

1112
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,730
Don't ask me to tie the rope.

1113
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,070
Okay. Forget it.

1114
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:22,300
- Busy, Major?
- What is it, Brodsky?

1115
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:26,070
We have identified the girl.
Here is her report.

1116
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,580
[Calloway] I've questioned her.
We've got nothing against her.

1117
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:33,120
We shall apply for her at
the Four Rower meeting tomorrow.

1118
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,820
She has no right to be here.

1119
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:40,260
I've asked your people
to help with Lime.

1120
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,030
That's a different case.
It is being looked into.

hang his opponent's picture on the wall.

1123
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,930
He got to know him that way.

1124
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,910
I'm beginning to know Lime.

1125
01:22:57,010 --> 01:23:01,070
I think this would've worked,
with your help.

Major Calloway. I -

1132
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:59,450
- I expect he's got a soft spot for you, miss.
- Why has he done all this?

Don't you worry, miss.
You're well out of things.

See me off?
From here?

Oh, I watched you onto the train, uh -

Of course not.

Harry, what is it?

1152

Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here. It'll be cold on that train.

- He can look after himself. Don't worry.

are you going to sit here?

No. No, leave them for a while.
