Long ago I began my one-man crusade

to protect her from crime and injustice
and then along came Robin.

Together we were a dynamic duo of justice

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,802
defending Gotham from villainous rogues
until young Robin grew up.

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,565
He took the name Nightwing and set out
to fight crime on his own in Gotham.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,362
But that wasn't the end of Robin's story.

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,323
A new Robin would soon join our ranks,

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,801
strengthening our team
and extending the reach

10

Thank you, Batman!

16
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,042
With Gotham's
vilest villains on the loose,

17
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,131
it's good to know our city is
in the capable hands of heroes like...

he can't trust Gotham City to an outsider.

Nostalgia is the path

Yes. I see...

Wait, what? What are you trying
to teach me, Madame Mantis?

"Forbidden move"?

317
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,206
Nightwing, what is that?
What's the "forbidden move"?

318
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,681
I'm not completely sure,

319
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,286
but I think it's some kind of move that,
for reasons unknown,

320
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,726
has been completely forbidden.

321
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,521
Thanks.

322
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,650
It is the only way
to save yourself, Batface.

323
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,769
No, stay back. This is my fight.

324
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,203
And it's about to end.

325
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,962
Ooh! Batface is finally ready to fight!

Do it! Finish me
and your training will be complete.

330
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,088
(GASPS) Batman, you can't!

331
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,241
No!

332
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,483
Whoa! Madame Mantis is really a man?

333
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,927
A very, very, very, ugly man.

334
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,244
"Man"? Hardly!

335
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,843
It just so happens that I am a Trogowog,
and I'll thank you not to forget it.

336
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,765
Obviously, I immediately knew
from your clumsy attack

337
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,088
that you couldn't be
the real Madame Mantis.

338
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,727
But I played along to find out
what you were up to.

339
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,927
But who are you?

340
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,122
And why did you impersonate
Batman's old master?

341
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,602
(GRUNTS) I shan't tell you.

342

tell you, Batman?

345
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,281
I know only that he's working for a
highly-trained and well-equipped mercenary.

346
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,641
How can you possibly know that?

347
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,849
From the hi-tech smoke bomb
that just landed at our feet.

348

349

Look!

350
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,045
Just as I suspected. Deathstroke.

351
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,970
Deathstroke? Here?

352
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,440
Isn't he some kind of mercenary?

353
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,486
Uh, yeah. He's only the most
deadly mercenary in the world.

354
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,961
Disguised killers. Deadly mercenaries.

I never thought I'd be homesick
for the peace and quiet of Gotham City.

We mustn't lose them.

357
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,571
They're our only hope
of finding the real Madame Mantis.

358
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,330
Less talk. More Bat-pursuit.

359
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,843
I guess I have time to brew
a fresh pot of coffee before he gets here.

360
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,647
My goodness, Batman,
that was faster than...

361
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,810
You must be Commissioner Gordon.
I'm Superman.

362
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,809
Yes, I know who you are.

363
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,566
I'm filling in for the Dark Knight
while he's away on vacation.

364
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,841
Vacation?

365
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,890
You know, Batman cannot say
enough good things about you.

366
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,368
He's practically chatty about it!
Well, for Batman, anyway.

367
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,529
Are we talking about the same guy?

368
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,762
What seems to be the problem,
Commissioner?

369
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,244
- Robin? I thought you were...
- Homework done!

370
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,204
Time to fight some crime.

371
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,407
It's the Joker.

372
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,161
That madcap madman
has escaped from Arkham Asylum. Again!

373
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,170
The Joker!
That's about as serious as it can get.

374
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,562
We'd better contact Batman
and inform him of...

375
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,769
What? And ruin his vacation? Nonsense!

376
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,804
The Joker's the guy
in the clown makeup, right?

377
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,443
He may look like a clown,
but he's no joke.

378
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,809
Batman has a specific
Joker protocol to follow.

379
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,840
First we round up his known associate...

380
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,480
We are not rounding up anything,
Boy Wonder.

381
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,047
Hello? It's a school night.

382
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,083
A growing boy needs eight hours of sleep.

383

I think I can handle this non-powered
clown all by myself, thank you.

(GROANS)

385
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,887
Well, if Batman must be out of town,

386
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,010
it's good to know he left Gotham
in the capable hands of a hero like...

387
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,761
Oh.

388
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,929
- You're still here.
- Why wouldn't I be?

389
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,764
I don't know, I thought you'd be gone.

390
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,770
You were still talking.
That'd be incredibly rude.

391
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,247
Besides, what if you said
something important?

392
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,888
Well, I try not to save
any important information till the end.

393
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,971
Never mind. Just go get the Joker.
And good luck!

394
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,044
No need for luck, Commissioner.
Superman is on the case!

395
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,684
I'll have the Joker back in Arkham
and Robin off to bed in no time.

396
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,441
Come, Boy Wonder.

397
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,365
So, that's what it's like
to finish a conversation.

398
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,124
Hmm. Not bad.

399
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,081
Hmm.

400
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,888
Deathstroke's tracks lead here.
Just as I feared.

401
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,926
Holy hole in the wall!

402
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,447
Wow. You actually say things like that.

403
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,483
I do not say "Holy" all the time.

404
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,327
I said it a couple times back when
I was Robin and it became a "thing."

405
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,966
I really never do it.
But, come on, I mean, look at this.

406
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,043
We'll need the Bat Hover Boat
to follow Deathstroke

407
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,641
and his Trogowog accomplice
where they're going.

408
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,089
Where are we going to get a hovercraft
in the middle of, uh, nowhere?

409
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,121
Wow.

410
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,766
This sort of thing really shouldn't come
as a surprise to you by now.

411
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,400
Listen carefully.

412
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,450
Where we're about to go
will test the limits of your mind.

413

What we're about to experience
will test the fortitude of your very soul.

414
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,207
You will not simply gaze
upon the secrets and mysteries

415

You know, your secrets have gazed into me,
enough already.

472

When are you going to tell us
what's really going on here?

473
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,402
I've not yet deduced the end
of this mystery.

474
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,642
But the beginning of it began long ago,

475
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,883
- when Deathstroke and I were best friends.
- BOTH: Huh?

476
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,847
It all started when I had just become
a student at Madame Mantis' dojo.

477
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,402
I remember it so clearly.

Time's up, miserable rookies.
Show me your art now.

00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,086
Hmm. Not bad, rich kid.

481
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,045
You are a regular Michelangelo
in papier-mâché.

482
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,929
From now on, I'll call you Batface.

483
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,243
Show me yours, sourpuss.

484
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,568
Ah! Scary.

485
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,768
I'm not finished,
I only painted half of it.

486
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,009
Believe me, it won't help.

487
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,850
You'll be the death of me, boy.

488
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,810
That's so terrifying,
it almost gave me a stroke.

489
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,483
From now on, I'll call you Strokedeath.

490
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,043
Oh. That sounds weird.
How about Deathstroke?

491
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,885
- Strokedeath!
- Ow!

492
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,082
BATMAN:
Madame Mantis' preferential treatment of me

493
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,642
eventually set the stage
for my relationship with Slade.

Very good, Batface.

496

You have mastered all the techniques
I have given you.

497
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,448
There is but one skill left...

499

whatever Madame Mantis deems fit.

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,007
No, I have been here longer.
I am the senior student.

501
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,969
You have to teach me the technique first.

502
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,168
I teach what I teach
to those ready to be taught.

503
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,249
And you are not ready, Strokedeath.

504
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,369
It's Deathstroke
and I'm ready for anything.

505
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,364
I am Slade Wilson.

506

I am the best at everything I do,

on this fool?

I don't need you
or your stupid forbidden move.

the world has ever known,

BATMAN:
I didn't see Slade again for years.

512
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,369
The next time I saw him,
he had become Deathstroke,

It's only a matter of time
before the Psyche Stone

rips the information we want
directly from your mind.

But I told you, Master,
I've vowed never to take a life.

It is worse.

654
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,001
It splits the body into pieces,

I know, that's why it's called
the forbidden move.

- Then why show me it at all?
- Hey, who's the master here?

We Trogowogs have always been
a peaceful people.

We used the sacred stone

He had heard whispers of our existence,
rumors of our great wealth.

Finally, after a long search, he found us

00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,485
and used the Psych Stone
to teach our people to hate.

00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,562
As you know, Batface, my family
befriended Trogowogs centuries ago.

00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,011
We perfected our martial arts

discovered the secret of the Trogowogs.

so we can liberate the Trogowogs
from Bane's rule.

00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,203
he overlooked the one thing
that can get us out of here.

769
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,120
- What?
- He missed that?

770
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,688

now that your honor has been restored...

1254
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,250
Look. Batface, our little class reunion

1255
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:53,405
has been just great,
but we're still not friends.

1256
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,163
And when next we meet,
it will be as true equals.

1257
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,201
That went well.

1258
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,249
He may not be a hero, Nightwing,

1259
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,966
but Deathstroke once again
walks the path of honor.

1260
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,724
And that may be enough.

1261
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,682
- (COMPUTER BEEPING)
- (ALL GROANING)

1262
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,401
Outsmarted by an oversized boy scout.
I'll never live it down.

1263
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,080
Never, never, never!

1264
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,646
SUPERMAN: Well, that's the last of them.

1265
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,322
Behind the walls of a completely reliable
mental health facility.

1266
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,006
And not a moment too soon. Look.

1267
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,161
Hi, guys.

1268
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,569
- Robin, listen...
- I know.

1269
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,081
Don't worry.

1270
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,368
There's really no reason
to let Batman know how...

1271
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,444
How Superman released all the inmates
from Arkham Asylum?

1272
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,206
The Joker outsmarted Superman
with a spoon?

1273
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,682
How the super-criminals almost succeeded
in the wrecking of the city?

1274
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,047
Yes, yes, that's it exactly.

1275
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,646
Batman. Welcome home, Dark Knight.

1276
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,041
Any trouble while I was away?

1277
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,201
No.

1278
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,125
Well, I mean, you know,
I mean, nothing out of the ordinary.

1279
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,328
I, uh... (STAMMERING)

1280
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,126
I cannot tell a lie!

1281
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,362
Joker outsmarted me with a spoon

1282
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,801
and tricked me into releasing
Arkham's criminals

1283
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,770
who almost succeeded
in wrecking Gotham City.

1284
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,886
It's true, Gotham's criminals are
an entirely new level of weird.

1285
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,724
They almost turned us into soup.

1286
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,522
Don't worry, I anticipated every part
of that, except the spoon.

1287
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,009
All that matters now is that
the city is safe once again

1288
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,889
thanks to the four of you.

1289
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,447
Excellent rescue
at Joker's Fun House, Robin.

1290
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,085
Great job, kid.

1291
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,244
I set a pretty high standard
when I was Robin,

1292
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,767
but you're taking it to a whole new level.

1293
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,288
Thanks, Nightwing. Thanks, Batman.

1294
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,920
But how did you know what happened
at Joker's Fun House?

1295
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,600
Because I'm...

1296
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,247
Batface.

1297
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,401
- Uh...
- Huh?

1298
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,450
BATMAN:
And so ends another heroic adventure.

1299
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,609
Justice has been served

1300
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,890
and our beloved Gotham City
is once again safe.

1301
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,805
Thanks to...
