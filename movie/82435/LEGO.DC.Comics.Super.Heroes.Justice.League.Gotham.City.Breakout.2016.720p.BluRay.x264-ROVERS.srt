1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,446
Gotham City, my city.

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,891
Long ago I began my one-man crusade

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,128
to protect her from crime and injustice
and then along came Robin.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,885
Together we were a dynamic duo of justice

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,802
defending Gotham from villainous rogues
until young Robin grew up.

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,565
He took the name Nightwing and set out
to fight crime on his own in Gotham.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,362
But that wasn't the end of Robin's story.

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,323
A new Robin would soon join our ranks,

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,801
strengthening our team
and extending the reach

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,008
of our protective cloak of justice

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,466
over every dark corner of our
beloved Gotham City.

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,281
Don't worry, Commissioner.
Batman and Robin are on the case!

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,846
Thank you, Batman!

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,042
With Gotham's
vilest villains on the loose,

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,131
it's good to know our city is
in the capable hands of heroes like...

16
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,567
You two?

17
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,403
Gone again.

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,920
That's it.
The last of the precious stones.

19
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,766
The rest of them are only
semi-precious stones.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,451
Not even worth the time
it'd take us to steal them.

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,524
Time, Penguin, is the one thing
you'll have plenty of

22
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,167
once you're back in your cell
at Arkham Asylum.

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,044
But first, let's see how you fit
in my new Bat-magnet cage.

24
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,924
Bull's-eye! I mean, Penguin's-eye!

25
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,206
Good shot, Robin.

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,761
That should keep him grounded
until the police arrive.

27
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,810
And that's the reason
I'm always the designated driver.

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,008
Ta-ta, Pengie!

29
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,609
You'll be catching a ride
back to Arkham together, Harley.

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,441
Carpooling is vital
to a healthy environment.

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,044
Hey, watch where you're driving!

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,961
Whoa!

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,605
Not you, Batman, you're good.

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,362
Poor Batman, you'll never catch me.

35
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,649
But maybe you'll catch a fish.

36
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,640
Like shooting fish in a barrel...
Without the barrel.

37
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,167
Give it up, Harley!

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,403
You're wanted for grand theft,
receiving stolen goods

39
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,608
and egregious prop comedy.

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,960
What's the matter, Batman?
My jokes driving you bananas?

41
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,843
Betrayed by my own bananas. Huh?

42
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,800
I may be going out on a limb here, Batman.

43
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,749
No, wait!
I'm definitely going out on a limb!

44
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,761
You're late, Harl.

45
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,965
Sorry, traffic in Gotham
will drive you batty.

46
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,051
Poison Ivy.

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,403
Keep your distance from her, Robin.

48
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,131
Associating with common
jewel thieves now, are we?

49
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,681
"Common"?

50
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,627
My share of the gems will go to ensuring the
well-being of plants everywhere, Batman.

51
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,531
A green thumb doesn't make up
for your black heart.

52
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,604
Weed killer? Who carries weed killer?

53
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,000
The Batman.

54
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,686
And also the Robin.

55
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,551
My babies!

56
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,447
Perhaps another trip to Arkham
will teach you the error of your ways.

57
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,602
And help you turn over a new leaf.

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,448
Robin, cover these two
until the authorities arrive.

59
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,047
Looks like there's one last villain
to wrangle.

60
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,763
I love it when a plan comes together.

61
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,486
Hey, look at that!

62
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,926
Whoa, cool!

63
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,491
In Gotham, everybody pays bus fare.

64
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,363
Aren't you the agile one?

65
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,681
Hmm.

66
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,691
What? Batman! But how?

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,161
Quite simple, really.

68
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,370
You uncannily anticipated
my every move as you fled.

69
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,086
I simply anticipated
you anticipating my every move

70
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,967
and adjusted accordingly, beating you
to the place I would've chased you to.

71
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,007
Impressive.

72
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,130
You shouldn't be too surprised, Nightwing!

73
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,010
Aw. How did you...

74
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,722
Oh, I bet it was my circus aerialist moves
that gave me away, right?

75
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,249
As well as a few special moves
that only I could have taught you.

76
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,201
Furthermore, I have deduced the reason
for your theatrical game of tag.

77
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,967
As today marks the anniversary of
the first appearance of the Batman,

78
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,726
and as most superheroes are
a highly emotional, sentimental lot,

79
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,649
you have obviously lured me
to this location

80
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,003
to set me up for some kind of
surprise party.

81
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,890
Surprise.

82
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,285
You shouldn't have.

83
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,644
I can't believe
he guessed our plan. Again!

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,049
You know, Batman, you take the fun
out of being your friend sometimes.

85
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,321
How so?

86
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,241
Happy Bat-Birthday, Batman!

87
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,441
You see what I did there?

88
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,002
Because you put "bat"
before "mobile" and "cave"?

89
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,483
The rest of the League wanted to be here,
but duty calls. Hey, look!

90
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,250
Most of the Teen Titans showed up!

91
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,985
Milkshake-consuming contest begin!

92
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,386
- I win!
- Aw.

93
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,526
So I see.

94
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,085
Happy anniversary, Bruce.

95
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,290
It's hardly happy for
the criminals of Gotham City, Diana.

96
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,408
I mean, thank you.

97
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,566
So, I know you don't want presents,

98
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,690
but Robin, Nightwing and I all chipped in
and got you something,

99
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,046
which is not easy,

100
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,323
because what do you buy for a guy
who literally has one of everything?

101
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,451
Batgirl, he can't literally have
one of everything.

102
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,445
That's true. I've inventoried the Batcave,
there are some things he has two of.

103
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,760
Boy, you are rich. Am I in your will?

104
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,210
Anyway, we realized there's not
some thing we can buy you

105
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,771
that you can't buy for yourself.

106
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,885
So, your present is something even better.

107
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,122
Quality time with us!

108
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,282
You're suggesting we take a vacation?

109
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,040
Surprise!

110
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,727
Very thoughtful.

111
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,730
Unfortunately,
crime doesn't take vacations.

112
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,961
Gotham needs me.

113
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,645
Well, of course it does!

114
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,168
But you need a break,
and I'll be happy to babysit your fair...

115
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,488
Fair-ish city while you're gone.

116
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,126
I don't know.

117
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,086
The villains in Gotham are a bit different
than the ones you're used to.

118
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,801
Well, sure, they're different.

119
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,008
For one thing, most of them
don't even have superpowers.

120
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,131
I don't think they'll be
too big a problem for me.

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,641
Don't underestimate Gotham's...

122
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,644
Bruce, Clark really can handle it.

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,844
And the rest of the Justice League
is only a phone call away.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,161
Oh, come on, Batman!

125
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,211
If there is one hero in this world
that deserves and needs a vacay,

126
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,765
it is definitely you.

127
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,726
- Fine.
- What? You'll do it?

128
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,122
Of course he said the yes.

129
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,685
How could one say no to Nightwing's
dreamy eyes of the puppy dog? Hmm-hmm.

130
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,010
Periods of rest are required to operate
at peak efficiency.

131
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,091
Besides, I'm a fun guy.

132
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,370
- When do we leave?
- Right now.

133
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,449
Before you change your mind.

134
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,286
Oh, man, I wanted
one of those freezer pops.

135
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,321
Thanks, Beast Boy!

136
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,881
Mmm.

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,488
I usually hate the lime ones.
This one's way better.

138
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,689
That's because it has my spit on it.

139
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,881
- Hmm.
- Ugh.

140
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,281
Whoa. Now I am feeling
the sickness of the stomach.

141
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,524
Here on the Bat-refrigerator
is a list of emergency numbers,

142
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,802
including Commissioner Gordon's cell.

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,606
If you can't reach me,
call him day or night.

144
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,247
No problem, worrywart.
Just try and have a good time.

145
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,962
Also, no video games for Robin after 8:30.

146
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,929
It gets him all wound up
before his bedtime.

147
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,682
What? This whole party was my idea!
I'm totally coming, too!

148
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,406
On a school night? I don't think so.

149
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,081
Aw.

150
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,651
Positive reinforcement?
Self-esteem building?

151
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,001
We talked about this.

152
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,087
Robin, I think what Batman is saying is that
he can't trust Gotham City to an outsider.

153
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,601
You know this town
and need to look out for Superman.

154
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,285
Isn't that right, Batman?

155
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,767
Sure.

156
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,929
Okay, Batman. Gotcha.

157
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,088
Keep the Big Blue Boy Scout
out of trouble.

158
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,880
Indeed. Hey, are you still here?

159
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,289
Because Robin and I really need
to get on with our duties. Right, pally?

160
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,721
Right, Superman!

161
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,329
So long! Farewell! Happy travels!

162
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,489
Ready to patrol the city, Superman?

163
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,327
I can show you where all the
most dangerous criminals like to lurk.

164
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,485
No, Robin, I'm afraid your first duty
tonight is to complete your homework!

165
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,721
- But...
- Uh-uh-uh.

166
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,566
Butts are for sittin'. Not for sassin'.

167
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,205
'Least that's what my ma used to say.
Never understood it. Let's go, youngster.

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,923
You might as well send me to jail.

169
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,691
We kept your old cell warm for ya, Harley.

170
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,684
Hey, for a girl who likes to play jokes,

171
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,004
why is it that Batman always gets
the last laugh?

172
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,521
Ha! See what you did there. Good one.

173
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,527
Ha. Everyone's a comedian.

174
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,247
Hey, Mr. J! I'm home! Whoo!

175
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,361
Huh?

176
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,089
Ooh. What's this?

177
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,643
Looks like the Bats
are leaving the belfry!

178
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,646
Well, while the Bats are away,
the Joker will play!

179
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,926
That's really not very funny.

180
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,391
No, it's not even a clever twist on
the popular idiom involving cats and mice.

181
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,462
Agreed.

182
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,610
Everyone's a critic.

183
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,882
It's you and me now, Spoony.
I liberated you from the kitchen.

184
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,204
Time to return the favor. Can you do it?

185
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,604
Sure thing, loser!

186
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,764
Oh, Spoony, you're the greatest.

187
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,607
We're going on vacation!
We're going on vacation!

188
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,566
We're on vacation!

189
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,681
Admit it, this was the best idea ever!

190
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,968
Yes, and it's been quite refreshing.

191
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,285
Time to head back to Gotham.

192
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,330
Oh, relax, Batman,
you're going to have a great time.

193
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,568
You'll never guess
what we've got lined up for you.

194
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,286
Based on your excessive sentimentality,

195
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,286
I theorize that you are taking me
on a trip down memory lane,

196
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,046
retracing my formative steps
with the various mentors

197
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,288
who helped me to become the Batman.

198
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,090
Ha! Wrong! We're taking you on
a trip down memory lane!

199
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,966
Retracing your formative steps
with the various mentors who... Gah!

200
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,487
Don't be too hard on yourself,
former Boy Wonder.

201
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,047
The only possible destination
in this part of the world

202
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,964
is this tiny uncharted atoll,

203
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,091
the home of my old instructor,
the venerable Madame Mantis.

204
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,729
We've been exchanging emails
with Madame Mantis for weeks now.

205
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,730
She seems like such a sweet old lady.
You're her all-time favorite student.

206
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,081
I just knew you'd want to see her.

207
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,801
"Sweet old lady"?
What did she teach you, Bats?

208
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,048
- Table manners and etiquette?
- Ow!

209
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,165
I think you could do with a lesson
in manners, sonny.

210
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,926
Hey! Where'd you come from?
I didn't hear you...

211
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,926
- Pointing?
- Ah! Ooh! Ahhh! Ow!

212
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,521
Uncle! Uncle!

213
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,968
I couldn't help but hear you
clomping around, bird boy.

214
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,561
Madame Mantis.

215
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,610
Please forgive the brash rudeness
of my former apprentice.

216
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,803
His youth leads him to foolishness.

217
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,250
He is no more brash or foolhardy
than you were, my former student.

218
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,450
I welcome you back
with gladness in my heart, Batface.

219
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,166
"Batface"?

220
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,683
Madame Mantis, it is so good to... Ow!

221
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,247
You lowered your eyes during your bow.

222
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,523
Your easy life in Gotham City
has made you soft!

223
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,160
Forgive me, sensei.

224
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,926
"Forgive me"?

225
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,886
Madame Mantis, this is Batgirl.

226
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,083
Hi, we met online.

227
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,882
And you've already hit...
Uh, met Nightwing.

228
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,803
Allow me to demonstrate to these
young ones the art of hospitality.

229
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,243
May I offer you some refreshing tea
after your long journey?

230
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,409
No, no, no. We're fine.

231
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,721
We had some on the plane. Really...

232
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,804
Why that sounds just lovely,
Madame Mantis.

233
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,844
Tea? Now that's more like it.
I would love some nice, hot... Tea!

234
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,840
Please, Madame Mantis!

235
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,526
On second thought,
I'm more of a coffee person.

236
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,568
You want one lump or two?

237
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,087
You must be the space between the teacups.

238
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,041
Madame Mantis'
unconventional teaching methods

239
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
instill absolute situational awareness
at all times.

240
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,206
You're telling me?

241
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,804
And I thought you were a tough teacher.

242
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,081
I did my best,

243
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,449
but my training doesn't hold a candle
to the instruction I received here.

244
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,046
You wallow in nostalgia, Batface.

245
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,284
Nostalgia is the path
a fool walks to a pity party.

246
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,041
And a pity party is nothing but
a stuffed bird in a cage with no door.

247
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,966
Or is it?

248
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,531
Yes. I see...

249
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,283
Wait, what? What are you trying
to teach me, Madame Mantis?

250
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,606
Only this,

251
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,129
a man who does not expect a surprise
attack in the middle of hearing wisdom

252
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,711
is like a worm who...

253
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,926
And you wonder why
I never come to class reunions.

254
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,131
Come now, student.
It will be just like old times.

255
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,971
That's what I'm afraid of.

256
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,970
Go get her, Batman!

257
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,166
No giggling.

258
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,930
You have kept much of the skill
you learned here,

259
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,771
but you still lack
the ability to defeat me.

260
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,641
Hmm.

261
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,767
For your final test,
you must attack without mercy!

262
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,126
Never!

263
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,967
Either you destroy me or I destroy you!

264
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,923
Madame Mantis, stop this madness!

265
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,520
The only way to stop anything
is for you to use the forbidden move!

266
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,561
"Forbidden move"?

267
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,206
Nightwing, what is that?
What's the "forbidden move"?

268
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,681
I'm not completely sure,

269
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,286
but I think it's some kind of move that,
for reasons unknown,

270
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,726
has been completely forbidden.

271
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,521
Thanks.

272
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,650
It is the only way
to save yourself, Batface.

273
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,769
No, stay back. This is my fight.

274
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,203
And it's about to end.

275
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,962
Ooh! Batface is finally ready to fight!

276
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,601
Do it! Finish me
and your training will be complete.

277
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,838
Batman, you can't!

278
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,241
No!

279
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,483
Whoa! Madame Mantis is really a man?

280
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,927
A very, very, very, ugly man.

281
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,244
"Man"? Hardly!

282
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,843
It just so happens that I am a Trogowog,
and I'll thank you not to forget it.

283
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,765
Obviously, I immediately knew
from your clumsy attack

284
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,088
that you couldn't be
the real Madame Mantis.

285
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,727
But I played along to find out
what you were up to.

286
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,927
But who are you?

287
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,122
And why did you impersonate
Batman's old master?

288
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,602
I shan't tell you.

289
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,085
I am an enigma wrapped in a riddle
wrapped in a stifling old woman costume.

290
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,526
What do your powers of deduction
tell you, Batman?

291
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,281
I know only that he's working for a
highly-trained and well-equipped mercenary.

292
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,641
How can you possibly know that?

293
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,949
From the hi-tech smoke bomb
that just landed at our feet.

294
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,966
Look!

295
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,045
Just as I suspected. Deathstroke.

296
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,970
Deathstroke? Here?

297
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,440
Isn't he some kind of mercenary?

298
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,486
Uh, yeah. He's only the most
deadly mercenary in the world.

299
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,961
Disguised killers. Deadly mercenaries.

300
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,971
I never thought I'd be homesick
for the peace and quiet of Gotham City.

301
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,647
We mustn't lose them.

302
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,571
They're our only hope
of finding the real Madame Mantis.

303
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,330
Less talk. More Bat-pursuit.

304
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,843
I guess I have time to brew
a fresh pot of coffee before he gets here.

305
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,647
My goodness, Batman,
that was faster than...

306
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,810
You must be Commissioner Gordon.
I'm Superman.

307
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,809
Yes, I know who you are.

308
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,566
I'm filling in for the Dark Knight
while he's away on vacation.

309
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,841
Vacation?

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,890
You know, Batman cannot say
enough good things about you.

311
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,368
He's practically chatty about it!
Well, for Batman, anyway.

312
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,529
Are we talking about the same guy?

313
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,762
What seems to be the problem,
Commissioner?

314
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,244
- Robin? I thought you were...
- Homework done!

315
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,204
Time to fight some crime.

316
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,407
It's the Joker.

317
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,161
That madcap madman
has escaped from Arkham Asylum. Again!

318
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,170
The Joker!
That's about as serious as it can get.

319
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,562
We'd better contact Batman
and inform him of...

320
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,769
What? And ruin his vacation? Nonsense!

321
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,804
The Joker's the guy
in the clown makeup, right?

322
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,443
He may look like a clown,
but he's no joke.

323
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,809
Batman has a specific
Joker protocol to follow.

324
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,840
First we round up his known associate...

325
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,480
We are not rounding up anything,
Boy Wonder.

326
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,047
Hello? It's a school night.

327
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,083
A growing boy needs eight hours of sleep.

328
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,966
I think I can handle this non-powered
clown all by myself, thank you.

329
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,887
Well, if Batman must be out of town,

330
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,010
it's good to know he left Gotham
in the capable hands of a hero like...

331
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,761
Oh.

332
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,929
- You're still here.
- Why wouldn't I be?

333
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,764
I don't know, I thought you'd be gone.

334
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,770
You were still talking.
That'd be incredibly rude.

335
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,247
Besides, what if you said
something important?

336
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,888
Well, I try not to save
any important information till the end.

337
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,971
Never mind. Just go get the Joker.
And good luck!

338
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,044
No need for luck, Commissioner.
Superman is on the case!

339
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,684
I'll have the Joker back in Arkham
and Robin off to bed in no time.

340
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,441
Come, Boy Wonder.

341
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,365
So, that's what it's like
to finish a conversation.

342
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,124
Hmm. Not bad.

343
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,081
Hmm.

344
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,888
Deathstroke's tracks lead here.
Just as I feared.

345
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,926
Holy hole in the wall!

346
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,447
Wow. You actually say things like that.

347
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,483
I do not say "Holy" all the time.

348
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,327
I said it a couple times back when
I was Robin and it became a "thing."

349
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,966
I really never do it.
But, come on, I mean, look at this.

350
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,043
We'll need the Bat Hover Boat
to follow Deathstroke

351
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,641
and his Trogowog accomplice
where they're going.

352
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,089
Where are we going to get a hovercraft
in the middle of, uh, nowhere?

353
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,121
Wow.

354
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,766
This sort of thing really shouldn't come
as a surprise to you by now.

355
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,400
Listen carefully.

356
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,450
Where we're about to go
will test the limits of your mind.

357
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,690
What we're about to experience
will test the fortitude of your very soul.

358
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,207
You will not simply gaze
upon the secrets and mysteries

359
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,289
that lie beyond these walls.

360
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,608
They will gaze into you.

361
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,004
There's no dishonor in backing out...

362
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,844
- I'm in!
- Let's do this!

363
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,205
Joker, Joker, Joker.

364
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,204
Where is the Joker?

365
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,046
Superman's cell phone.
Superman speaking, how can I help you?

366
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,884
- It's Robin.
- Hi, Robin.

367
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,042
Wait. Isn't it your bedtime?

368
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,566
Working on it.
Have you found the Joker yet?

369
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,760
It's not easy.
It's so dark and gritty here in Gotham.

370
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,763
Metropolis is all clean and white.

371
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,501
It's easier to pick out the criminals.

372
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,007
Bingo! There he is.
I'll have him locked up in no time.

373
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,686
Be careful, Superman.

374
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,684
The Joker is one of
Batman's trickiest foes.

375
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,370
Yes, I'm sure a non-powered foe
can be a challenge for a non-powered hero.

376
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,885
Gotta go, bad guy to catch.

377
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,921
Oh, Spoony, isn't it wonderful?

378
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,285
With Batsy gone,
all of Gotham is our own funhouse.

379
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,807
There's nothing fun about crime, Joker.

380
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,202
Look, Spoony.

381
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,526
Batsy decided to leave Little Boy Blue
to watch the house while he's away.

382
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,081
This is gonna be fun.

383
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,447
Uh, yes, well, the only fun you
and your, uh, spoon will be having

384
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,931
is back in your cell at Arkham.

385
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,731
No, you'll never take us back there.

386
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,962
Spoony will never allow it.

387
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,802
Give up now, Joker. I have superpowers,

388
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,610
and all you have is a...

389
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,283
- A spoon.
- Superpowers? Like what?

390
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,127
Can you grow money from trees?

391
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,601
Well, no.

392
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,041
Can you make dogs invisible?

393
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,601
Spoony, that's not even a real superpower.

394
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,282
Perhaps a demonstration for Spoony?

395
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,889
Well, I can shoot super-hot beams
from my eyes with super-accuracy.

396
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,368
Oh, really? Prove it, you big goof.

397
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,327
Oh, well done, Spoony.

398
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,042
Thanks, Super-sucker.

399
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,687
Batman will not be happy about this.

400
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,767
All right, Joker, you may have tricked me
once or twice.

401
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,162
I'm starting to see why
the Bat bunch wanted that vacation.

402
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,887
How do you like your vacation so far?

403
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,523
Beautiful surroundings,
a touch of adventure.

404
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,523
- Waterfall!
- Waterfall?

405
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,089
- Come on.
- Okay, this thing is bottomless.

406
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,761
A bottomless pit
is a spatial impossibility.

407
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,890
This is just a very, very, very deep hole.

408
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,847
You know, your secrets have gazed into me,
enough already.

409
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,208
When are you going to tell us
what's really going on here?

410
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,402
I've not yet deduced the end
of this mystery.

411
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,642
But the beginning of it began long ago,

412
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,883
- when Deathstroke and I were best friends.
- Huh?

413
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,847
It all started when I had just become
a student at Madame Mantis' dojo.

414
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,402
I remember it so clearly.

415
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,562
Our very first class together was
Arts and Crafts.

416
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,808
Time's up, miserable rookies.
Show me your art now.

417
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,086
Hmm. Not bad, rich kid.

418
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,045
You are a regular Michelangelo
in papier-mâché.

419
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,929
From now on, I'll call you Batface.

420
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,243
Show me yours, sourpuss.

421
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,568
Ah! Scary.

422
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,768
I'm not finished,
I only painted half of it.

423
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,009
Believe me, it won't help.

424
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,850
You'll be the death of me, boy.

425
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,810
That's so terrifying,
it almost gave me a stroke.

426
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,483
From now on, I'll call you Strokedeath.

427
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,043
Oh. That sounds weird.
How about Deathstroke?

428
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,885
- Strokedeath!
- Ow!

429
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,082
Madame Mantis' preferential treatment of me

430
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,642
eventually set the stage
for my relationship with Slade.

431
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,769
Very good, Batface.

432
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,810
You have mastered all the techniques
I have given you.

433
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,448
There is but one skill left...

434
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,650
The forbidden move.

435
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,129
I would be honored to learn
whatever Madame Mantis deems fit.

436
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,007
No, I have been here longer.
I am the senior student.

437
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,969
You have to teach me the technique first.

438
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,168
I teach what I teach
to those ready to be taught.

439
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,249
And you are not ready, Strokedeath.

440
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,369
It's Deathstroke
and I'm ready for anything.

441
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,364
I am Slade Wilson.

442
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,927
I am the best at everything I do,

443
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,050
and you waste your senile talents
on this fool?

444
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,764
I don't need you
or your stupid forbidden move.

445
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,327
I'll become the greatest fighter
the world has ever known,

446
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,404
and I'll do it on my own.

447
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,042
I didn't see Slade again for years.

448
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,369
The next time I saw him,
he had become Deathstroke,

449
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,682
the world's most deadly mercenary.

450
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,084
- Okay, wow, you were a kid once?
- What about that Trogowog dude?

451
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,360
To be continued.

452
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,086
Welcome to the land of the Trogowogs.

453
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,647
A secret world protected by Madame Mantis

454
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,010
and hidden from the corruptive
influence of mankind.

455
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,609
Welcome, Batman.

456
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,164
Don't move, I've got you
right where I want you.

457
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,161
Huh?

458
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,284
- Who's got who?
- I've got you.

459
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,169
Oh, how I love a surprise party.
Wouldn't you agree?

460
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,806
Indubitably, they were
wonderfully surprised.

461
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,724
Good show, Master Deathstroke.

462
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,966
Batman, Batgirl and Nightwing...

463
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,971
So nice of you to...

464
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,248
If you say, "Nice of you to drop in,"

465
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,688
you immediately lose all credibility
as a supervillain.

466
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,087
- That's not what I was going to say.
- Oh, what were you going to say?

467
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,763
Well, I don't want to tell you now.

468
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,843
And as for you, Batface,

469
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,083
if you want your junior helpers
to survive the next five seconds,

470
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,730
you know what to do.

471
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,606
Ha! If you think the mighty Dark Knight
is about to surrender,

472
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,081
- you've got another...
- Heh.

473
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,611
I stand corrected.

474
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,163
Come to me, my yummy piece of pepperoni.

475
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,487
Hey, there... Uh, Cyborg.

476
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,290
Wow, Superman, hi.

477
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,649
I definitely wasn't eating pizza
at the Hall of Justice very special table.

478
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,485
Ah. Good, good. Fantastic.

479
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,407
Superman, is anything...

480
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,961
- Wrong?
- What?

481
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,322
No, no, everything's great.

482
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,885
I just thought maybe you might
want to uh, hang out a little.

483
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,311
You know, like you kids say.

484
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,324
You know what?
Maybe a little help around here

485
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,006
- wouldn't be completely unwelcome.
- Hey, Wonder Woman's here.

486
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,288
- You want to ask her?
- No! No, no, no.

487
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,365
No need to bother her, we got this.

488
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,883
No real reason to mention it to anyone
in the League, ever.

489
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,485
Oh. Okay. Whatever. Happy to help.
Just you and me, taking on crime.

490
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,483
- We'll be a great team.
- Absolutely.

491
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,610
Just like Batman and Robin.
Fine, see you soon.

492
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,928
Very soon. Please hurry.

493
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,167
"Just like Batman and Robin."

494
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,811
Quit it, you little cave-monkey-thing.

495
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,242
Cave-monkey-thing?

496
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,281
- Well, I never.
- Dear sir, we are Trogowogs.

497
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,143
An ancient species that walked the Earth
long before you surface dwellers arrived.

498
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,011
And your brash words
have vexed our refined sensibilities.

499
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,961
What have you done
with our sensei, Deathstroke?

500
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,726
The old Mantis is fine, Batman.

501
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,127
For now.

502
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,847
Madame Mantis guarded the secret of the
Trogowogs like a pearl inside an oyster,

503
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,924
inside a safe, inside a vault,
inside a mountain with no door.

504
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,528
But somehow you found a way in.

505
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,561
Not me, Batman.

506
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,802
The mystery is just killing you isn't it?

507
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,526
I'm enjoying that.

508
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,884
But I'm not the villain
who will be monologuing the plot details.

509
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,562
You'll meet him soon enough.

510
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,929
"Monologuing"?
That's not a proper word, is it?

511
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,241
Well, I should say not.

512
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,847
Surface dwellers seem to
have a mania for slang.

513
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,581
Bane.

514
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,764
I think you mean "Lord Bane," Batman.

515
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,209
Deathstroke and Bane? Working together?

516
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,089
Maybe they met while mask shopping.

517
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,841
Welcome to my underground nation.

518
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,449
- The newly named Bane-donia.
- Uh...

519
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,369
- Bane-landia?
- Mmm...

520
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,045
- Bane-sylvania.
- Blech.

521
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,009
- Bane-danistan?
- Needs work.

522
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,966
Whatever you call it, Bane, your
totalitarian occupation of these Trogowogs

523
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,610
is destined to fail.

524
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,526
Despite your fiendish use
of their mind-influencing crystal,

525
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,524
the Psyche Stone.

526
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,203
You see? I told you.

527
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,450
The old Mantis shared all of her secrets
with him.

528
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,321
Well, I wish would share some
secrets with us because I got nothing.

529
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,686
I got no idea what's going on here.

530
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,842
And cue monologue.

531
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,125
- Ooh! I do so love a good story.
- Ssh! It's about to begin.

532
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,201
- Well, you see...
- Bane must be using that Psyche Stone

533
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,331
to mentally transform the Trogowogs
into assassins infused with his fury

534
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,369
and Deathstroke's martial arts skills.

535
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,325
- Ah. But that's only part...
- Ooh. Of course.

536
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,847
He's creating an army
to conquer the world, no doubt.

537
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,641
And in order to make his army undefeatable
he needs them to learn the forbidden move.

538
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,569
- But...
- So they kidnapped Madame Mantis

539
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,451
and tried to extract the forbidden move
from her mind using the Psyche Stone.

540
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,125
- Yes, and...
- But they failed

541
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
because her will is too strong.

542
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,247
So they lured me here to try to pry
the secret from my mind.

543
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,368
- Brilliant.
- Well played.

544
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,366
You know, detectives, you take the fun
out of being a villain sometimes.

545
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,967
But only sometimes.

546
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,684
- Good day to you.
- And you.

547
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,766
- I'll never talk.
- You won't have to.

548
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,646
It's only a matter of time
before the Psyche Stone

549
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,929
rips the information we want
directly from your mind.

550
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,163
Come now, Batman. Share and share alike.

551
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,803
- Over my dead body.
- That can be arranged.

552
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
The Psyche Stone energy is deadly,

553
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,383
and you've been bathing in it
for quite some time.

554
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,403
Yes, show us.
Show us what we want to know.

555
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,909
Show us the forbidden move.

556
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,642
Oh, it's a motion picture story.

557
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,569
Mmm. This is such an exciting day.

558
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,321
Watch carefully, Batface.

559
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,370
I don't go around showing
the forbidden move every day.

560
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,366
- Is this going to be on the test?
- Yes, the test of life!

561
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,371
Observe and marvel at the forbidden move.

562
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,961
Oh! Here it comes.

563
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,011
Whoa...

564
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,160
Amazing.

565
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,531
But I told you, Master,
I've vowed never to take a life.

566
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,003
This move does not kill.

567
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,601
It is worse.

568
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,001
It splits the body into pieces,

569
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,488
but life remains.

570
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,563
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

571
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,566
- That's horrible.
- Duh!

572
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,451
I know, that's why it's called
the forbidden move.

573
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,683
- Then why show me it at all?
- Hey, who's the master here?

574
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,687
Now, it's very simple,
you just form your hand into a C-shape

575
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,921
and...

576
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,531
No!

577
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,888
Oh, I say, it was only just arriving
at the good part.

578
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,561
- Mmm, how very anticlimactic.
- Tut-tut.

579
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,284
Get back in that beam.
We must have that secret.

580
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,608
No, he's barely surviving now.

581
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,089
If the beam destroys him before we have
our prize, it is lost to us forever.

582
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,361
Come now, Deathstroke,
where is your spirit of hospitality?

583
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,881
Put him in the Presidential Suite.

584
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,801
Holy garbage truck,
Gotham City is filthy with criminals.

585
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,680
Holy what? Why are you talking like that?

586
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,130
Wait, you don't usually wear a cape,
do you, Cyborg?

587
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,768
Uh. Yes.

588
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,446
Yes, I do.

589
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,763
And would you please call me Boy Wonder?

590
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,409
Mmm. X-ray vision reveals...

591
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,649
I believe we've found the lady criminal
called Poison Ivy.

592
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,611
Holy horticulture, Bat... I mean Superman.

593
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,802
- What do we do now?
- Follow my lead.

594
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,182
We'll have this plant back in her pot
before you can say "evergreen."

595
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,322
Not bad.

596
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,922
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm afraid
your thieving days are over.

597
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,647
You wouldn't hit a lady, would you, boys?

598
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,371
Why, no. Of course not.

599
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,564
- But I mean...
- Good.

600
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,448
This may be more difficult than I thought.

601
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,190
- Wonder Woman?
- Okay. Call Wonder Woman.

602
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,005
With the light of the underworld
coming from bioluminescent plants

603
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,642
and strange phosphorescent stones,
it's a land of perpetual day,

604
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,530
impossible to keep time, yet...

605
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,921
We must try.

606
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,600
- We've been here for about an hour.
- That sounds about right.

607
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,366
Is someone there?

608
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,606
Monstrous humans, stay back!

609
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,365
Madame Mantis.

610
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,003
- It must be the real one.
- She's quite real and quite weak.

611
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,810
My cane.

612
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,491
My cane.

613
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,086
Here it is.

614
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,924
Are you all right? Ow!

615
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,767
Of course I'm not all right, dumbo.

616
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,287
I've been tortured by a magic rock
for two weeks.

617
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,444
But I didn't break.

618
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,651
I don't know how she endured it.
Mantis is so very strong.

619
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,451
I, on the other hand, am so very weak.

620
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,008
Oh, you're not so bad, kid.

621
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,408
You take good care of Madame Mantis.

622
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,041
This is Prince Grungle,
rightful ruler of this place.

623
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,246
They're coming. Quickly, we must cower.

624
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,562
Batman!

625
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,883
Stay away from her, you brute.

626
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,450
Some prince you turned out to be.

627
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,729
Yes, all the backbone of a jellyfish.

628
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,111
Lucky for us, Bane showed up when he did.

629
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,321
Never

630
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,444
tell forbidden move.

631
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,883
Oh, I'm sorry, but you will, Batface.

632
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,488
Madame Mantis.

633
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,927
That stone of theirs is strong.

634
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,606
Almost too strong, even for me.

635
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,888
Oh, this is all my fault.

636
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,284
When Bane arrived here,
I was too weak to stop him.

637
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,966
- Also a little bit chicken.
- Nightwing.

638
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,083
Prince Grungle
is clearly one of the good guys.

639
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,605
A little respect?

640
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,450
No, no, he's quite right.

641
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,324
I am no real prince.

642
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,086
A proper prince would've been brave,
put up a fight.

643
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,130
But I didn't know how.

644
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,011
We Trogowogs have always been
a peaceful people.

645
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,051
We used the sacred stone
to spread friendship and love.

646
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,483
Until Bane arrived.

647
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,288
He had heard whispers of our existence,
rumors of our great wealth.

648
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,565
Finally, after a long search, he found us

649
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,485
and used the Psych Stone
to teach our people to hate.

650
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,760
He destroyed my father, the king,
while I watched,

651
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,809
frozen in fear.

652
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,165
Now the Trogowogs are a violent mob
and follow a king of hate.

653
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,603
Don't be too hard on your people, Grungle.

654
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,404
Bane is pretty scary.

655
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,403
And everyone is afraid sometimes.

656
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,766
Bravery is just fighting for what you know
is right even when you're afraid.

657
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,766
Bane's corruption of the Trogowogs
is a travesty of justice.

658
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,562
As you know, Batface, my family
befriended Trogowogs centuries ago.

659
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,011
We perfected our martial arts
to protect and defend them.

660
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,807
I don't know how Bane
discovered the secret of the Trogowogs.

661
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,687
Well, maybe you talked in your sleep? Ow!

662
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,809
Batman, we've got to find a way to escape

663
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,367
so we can liberate the Trogowogs
from Bane's rule.

664
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,007
Hello, escape-proof cage,
confiscated utility belts.

665
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,091
- We're all helpless here.
- Not quite.

666
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,961
Deathstroke was so focused
on getting my utility belt,

667
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,203
he overlooked the one thing
that can get us out of here.

668
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,120
- What?
- He missed that?

669
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,688
I say, what is that?

670
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,407
This, Prince Grungle,
is my Bat-brick separator.

671
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,960
Observe.

672
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,040
Holy crowbar.

673
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,563
That titanic tool could topple a tower.
I did it again, didn't I?

674
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,846
Focus.

675
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,651
Once I break through,
we'll have to move quickly to stop Bane.

676
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,567
Because if we don't, no force on Earth
will be able to stop his Trogowog army.

677
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,729
Not even the Justice League.

678
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,521
So kind of you gentlemen
to provide dinner on our first date,

679
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,611
- especially when you're the main course.
- Mighty Aphrodite.

680
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,603
It's a good thing
you boys called for backup.

681
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,090
Now, tell me what you've done
to my friends.

682
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,928
My special plant pheromones
have intoxicated your friends

683
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,168
and placed them under my control.

684
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,570
And now I have you, too.

685
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,602
We overheard Cyborg's pathetic call
for your help.

686
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,843
We've been waiting for you.

687
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,930
Now the real fun begins.

688
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:06,126
Ladies and gentlemen, Cyborgs,
Supermen and Wonder Women.

689
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,682
Welcome to Gotham's
preeminent party palace,

690
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,684
the Joker Fun House.

691
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,430
Fun for us, anyway.

692
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,202
Oh, Spoony, you're so bad.

693
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,050
Whoa. Is that a talking spoon?

694
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,646
I've had enough of this nonsense, Joker.

695
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,803
I'm not falling for any more tricks.

696
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,144
Did somebody say "falling"?

697
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,245
You two need to work on
your emergency stops.

698
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,608
Out of the water and into the frying pan.

699
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,687
Give it up, Penguin.
Unlike Batman, bullets have no effect on...

700
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,571
What is that?

701
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,001
A fish?

702
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,404
I hate Gotham City. Ugh.
Its criminals are so weird.

703
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,450
Don't worry, Superman,
I've activated my internal nose plugs

704
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,648
and deactivated my gag reflex.

705
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,161
I'll pluck that foul fish-flinging fowl.

706
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,361
Whoa!

707
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,729
Unlike real penguins, this one can fly.

708
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,364
Scarecrow, hit 'em with your fear gas.

709
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,561
Huh?

710
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,251
- Look how high up we are.
- No, no, no.

711
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,968
I'm suddenly afraid of heights.

712
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,649
Ha-ha! Looks like you forgot to buckle up.

713
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,921
Too bad, because the ride's
only just beginning.

714
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,968
- Hello.
- Hey, Robin.

715
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,442
Starfire and I are about to finish off
Giganta here in Metropolis.

716
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,641
How about you ditch the cave and join us
for our next adventure, Pizza Pandemonium.

717
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,968
Sorry, Beast Boy, no can do.

718
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,971
What? Because it's a school night?

719
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,982
Or is it really because you're a...

720
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,569
Chicken, get it?
Because I became a chicken?

721
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,886
Save some pizza for me.

722
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,191
I have to stay here in Gotham
and handle a big problem.

723
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,321
The air is just electric today, isn't it?

724
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,290
It's as though something exciting
will happen at any moment.

725
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,807
- Scintillating.
- I'm all a-tingle.

726
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,684
The coast is clear. Come quickly.

727
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,571
Thank you, old friend.

728
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,764
What now? Find our way back up
the nearly bottomless pit?

729
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,286
Once we climb up a few miles,

730
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,569
we should be able to signal the rest
of the Justice League for help.

731
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,449
Ow! What was that for?

732
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,729
A book with no pages
is never overdue from the library.

733
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,205
Right. What?

734
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,767
Madame Mantis is saying that
Bane is a bully.

735
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,250
And the only way to deal with a bully
is to stand up to them.

736
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,642
Our decampment from that ghastly Gulag
has been discovered.

737
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,370
What shall we do?

738
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,230
Remember, Grungle, bravery isn't
what you feel, it's what you do.

739
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,121
Batman, hear me.
There is no escape for you.

740
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,683
The tyrant.
He's grown to gargantuan proportions.

741
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,081
Flee!

742
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,925
Calm yourself, Prince Grungle.

743
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,402
Bane's merely using the Psyche Stone
to project this image of himself.

744
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,801
Turn yourself in
and I may spare the lives of your friends.

745
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,082
Prince Grungle! Wait, it's nothing.

746
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,442
Wrong. It is something.

747
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,461
It is a trap.

748
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,410
Well, well, well.

749
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,966
The prince.

750
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,445
Or should I say,
the former prince, future sushi.

751
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,285
Ugh. We've been searching forever.

752
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,407
We should forget looking for him and get back
to the surface world for reinforcements.

753
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,847
Grungle is alone and he's frightened.

754
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,363
This whole weird underworld plus our world
is doomed

755
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,443
if Bane gets his hands on Bats again.

756
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,926
Now that's frightening.

757
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,402
It's too late.
Grungle has certainly been recaptured.

758
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,485
- Oh, come on, you can't possibly know...
- Batman.

759
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,881
I have a friend here
who'd like to talk to you.

760
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,126
On second thought,
he's not much of a talker.

761
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,785
More of a whimperer.

762
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,448
And he won't even be
doing that much longer.

763
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,125
I will see you soon.

764
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,763
You can't go back for him.
You're playing right into his hands.

765
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,928
But we can't leave Grungle for dead.

766
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,567
You go, I'll try to free Grungle.

767
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,165
He can't get the secret from me.
No one can crack this old nut.

768
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,290
No, there's only one way to stop Bane.

769
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,841
How?

770
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,602
By giving him the secret of
the forbidden move.

771
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,849
This Kryptonite bathtub
is strangely soothing.

772
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,766
Must be those vegetables Poison Ivy added
to this soup we're sitting in.

773
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,605
Despite our certain demise
I just feel so calm right now.

774
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,683
I blame the spoon.

775
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,521
- Why's that?
- It's a soup spoon.

776
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,004
And very soon now, Spoony,
they'll be boiled away into vapors.

777
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,127
And we'll be rid of half of the world's
most annoying superheroes.

778
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,644
Emphasis on the soup.

779
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,051
He's breaking.

780
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,687
Must fight stone.

781
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,401
Dance.

782
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,800
Dance!

783
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,525
He wants to dance?

784
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,241
The mind is like
a brain-shaped piñata, Deathstroke.

785
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,528
As we beat it to shreds,
the hard candies of random memory spills

786
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,489
on the lawn of destiny.

787
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,165
Increase the power.

788
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,123
This move does not kill.

789
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,726
It is worse.

790
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,488
It splits the body into pieces,
but life remains.

791
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,087
- That's horrible.
- Duh!

792
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,005
I know. That's why it's called
the forbidden move.

793
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,611
Then why show me it at all?

794
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,524
Hey, who's the master here?

795
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,041
Now, it's very simple.

796
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,447
You just form your hand into a C-shape

797
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,288
and will all your chi
into one tiny stud of power.

798
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,646
Incredible.

799
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,367
Now, hurl the stud of power
toward the dummy of practice.

800
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,481
Finally, I have the forbidden move!

801
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,960
What are we laughing at?

802
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,006
I don't know, I think he's just creating
a fun work environment.

803
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,127
It is done. They now know all.

804
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,611
Wonder Woman, Cyborg, it was my pleasure
to fight alongside you.

805
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,762
Me, too.

806
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,048
Oh, no, it's Batman. He's back.

807
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,562
Pull yourself together.
It's only the Brat Wonder.

808
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,001
That's right.

809
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,081
And I wonder how you're going to like me
shutting down your hot tub of horror.

810
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,603
You butting-in bird boy.

811
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,490
Wish I could stay and chat,
but I have some friends to save.

812
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,000
Out of the pool, Justice League.
Adult swim is over.

813
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,929
Come on, before they regroup.

814
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,950
Right in the funny bone.

815
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,962
I just had the strangest dream.

816
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,328
There was a hot tub and Wonder Woman.

817
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,563
- Wha...?
- No time for that now, Cyborg.

818
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,449
Up, up and away.

819
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,729
Look, the Justice League is running away.

820
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,447
Gotham is ours.

821
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,840
Poison Ivy's soup made my servos squeak.

822
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,005
- Thanks for coming to save us, Robin.
- You really are the Boy Wonder.

823
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,729
I wouldn't have had to save you if you
had listened to me in the first place.

824
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,086
Tell me about it.

825
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,528
And when Batman gets back,
he's going to give me "the look."

826
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,043
Because he loaned me a perfectly good city
and I broke it.

827
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,607
Oh, yes, I know that look.

828
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,046
Okay, I'm going to help you
clean up this mess.

829
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,443
But just because some of our criminals
don't have superpowers

830
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,728
doesn't mean they're not super-dangerous.

831
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,120
You got that right.

832
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,841
They're unpredictable, diabolical,
dangerous villains.

833
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,368
And there's only one way to stop them.

834
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,965
What way is that?

835
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,605
The Bat-way.

836
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,650
One to a customer.
Keep the line moving, please.

837
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,321
That's it.

838
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,768
Let the Psyche Stone
fill your little minds with the deadly

839
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,924
forbidden move.

840
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,122
Oh! I say, the forbidden move
is jolly easy once you know the secret.

841
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,403
Yes, yes, move along.

842
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,963
Hmm. Where did Deathstroke sneak off to?

843
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,164
Deathstroke, what do you want?

844
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,321
The only thing he's ever wanted.

845
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,847
That's right. To prove she's wrong.

846
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,242
To prove I'm better than you.

847
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,010
There was no "better."

848
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,687
Only those that are ready to learn.
And you are not ready, Strokedeath.

849
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,808
- It's Deathstroke.
- Wait a minute.

850
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,088
Batman said
you were best friends at school.

851
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,686
- Wait, what?
- We were also worst enemies.

852
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,890
- There were only two of us in the class.
- Grr!

853
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,049
This is on your head.

854
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,850
You preferred him over me.

855
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,526
Just because you thought his mask
was better than mine.

856
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,000
I never got the purple/orange thing.

857
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,168
- It is better.
- There's really not much to yours.

858
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,244
It is not me who determined your destiny.
It was only ever you, Strokedeath.

859
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,364
Argh! I told you, it's Deathstroke.

860
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,688
No, you picked him over me.

861
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,201
And you were wrong.

862
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,285
Now that I know the forbidden move,
I'll show you who's really the best.

863
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,527
That's hardly fair.

864
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,371
Batman is zonked out of his ears
and you want to fight him?

865
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,045
Enough talk.

866
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,646
Come, Batman. Fight me.

867
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,688
Prove that you were worthy
of Madame Mantis' skills.

868
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,045
Give it up, Deathstroke.

869
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,488
True victory only comes
when you fight for a good cause.

870
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,049
I fight for the best cause of all.

871
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,241
Myself.

872
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,970
Then you have already lost.

873
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,403
Gah! I'll show you who's lost.

874
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,885
You've done it. You've bested me.

875
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,489
With the power of the forbidden move,
the world is yours.

876
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,003
You'll never be challenged again.

877
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,171
Now, finish it, old friend.

878
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,401
Hmm.

879
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,763
No, I can't do it.

880
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,441
It's just too easy.

881
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,687
I envy you, Batman,
for being everything I'm not.

882
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,522
You could have used the forbidden move
against me all these years.

883
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,211
But you didn't.

884
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,284
You're just too darned honorable.

885
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,008
You don't deserve to be destroyed
by such a despicable technique.

886
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,969
- Thank you, Slade.
- It is done.

887
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,761
- Uh, she's free?
- Wait a minute.

888
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,520
You could have gotten out of those ropes
anytime you wanted.

889
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,446
Your lesson is completed, Strokedeath.

890
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,849
You have now earned the knowledge
of the forbidden move.

891
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,165
I don't understand.
I just failed to use the forbidden move.

892
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,008
- I don't think I'll ever use it.
- That is how I know you are ready for it.

893
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,484
All have the potential
to be an honorable warrior,

894
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,008
but only through an act of honor
could it be attained.

895
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,169
You... You're right, Madame Mantis. Ow!

896
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,526
Of course.

897
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,044
- Madame Mantis is always right.
- But it's too late.

898
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,045
I've done everything wrong.

899
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,648
Bane's army is ready to invade
the world above

900
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,484
and there is nothing I can do to stop it.

901
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,369
Maybe you can't do it alone.

902
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,571
But we can do it together, classmate.

903
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,803
It would be an honor.

904
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,245
And now, newly appointed
Police Commissioner Spoony

905
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,891
shall review my suggestions
for the new rules of Gotham City.

906
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,922
Amnesty for all criminals?

907
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,362
Approved.

908
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,928
Imprisonment for all superheroes?

909
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,089
Double approved.

910
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,566
Hooray!

911
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,367
Commissioner Spoony,
oh, you're the greatest.

912
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,451
Knock, knock.

913
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,965
Who's there?

914
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,121
Ima.

915
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,220
Ima who?

916
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,787
Ima send you right back to Arkham
where you belong, Joker.

917
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,367
Oh, knocked out by a knock-knock joke.

918
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,562
From the Big Blue Bore Scout.

919
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,591
Now that's a laugh.

920
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,271
Where's Spoony?

921
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,046
Spoony won't be joining you
back in Arkham, Joker.

922
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:09,210
Hope you enjoy eating
the Asylum oatmeal with your hands.

923
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,321
Underlings.

924
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,321
It is time for us to take our rightful place
as the rulers of the surface world.

925
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,084
Frankly, it'll be me doing most of the ruling
and you doing most of the oppressing.

926
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,322
We all have our jobs to do. C'est la vie.

927
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,360
Now, go forth and fulfill your destiny.

928
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:45,808
Bane!

929
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,089
I must say, I'm so excited
to get to the surface world.

930
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,645
Because of all the conquering?

931
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,724
No, frankly, I'm just looking forward
to getting a tan.

932
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,370
For countless millennia your family could
have ordered a wave of Trogowog might

933
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,727
to sweep the armies
of the surface world aside.

934
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,049
But you did nothing.

935
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,521
It took Bane to make something of you.

936
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,729
We were a peaceful people

937
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,248
until you poisoned us
with your vile destructiveness.

938
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,362
Peace is like a stale potato chip
left out in the rain

939
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,444
and stepped on by a group of schoolgirls.

940
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,331
You deserve your fate, you cowering dog.

941
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,483
Your people marching on my orders

942
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,486
will be the final thing you see
before I destroy you.

943
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,127
Well, better that than you, Bane.

944
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,121
You're hard to look at
even with the mask on.

945
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,362
- Who dares?
- We dare.

946
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,721
Oh!

947
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,606
Do you expect me to lose to
two tiny heroes?

948
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,840
No, we expect you to lose
to one medium-sized hero.

949
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,121
How rude of me.
I should have offered you a chair.

950
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,366
No.

951
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,447
Time for a little rodent control.

952
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,404
- Oh, we're going into a tunnel.
- I do hope no one tries to text me.

953
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,609
That's far enough.

954
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,867
- Oh, look, our first victims.
- For the glory of Bane!

955
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,042
This is going to be harder
than we thought.

956
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,804
Maybe not as hard as you think.

957
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,484
What? How?

958
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,122
I took the liberty of summoning
my Bat-drill with this.

959
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,289
It's been digging ever since.

960
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,169
I suspected it might come in handy.

961
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,691
That ghastly machine gave me a turn.

962
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,765
Destroy it!

963
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,481
- These little guys don't give up easily.
- Neither do we.

964
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,961
Ha!

965
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,369
As good as we are,
we can't defeat an entire army.

966
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,641
Not at this rate.

967
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,407
Oh, emancipated.

968
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,249
But what do I do now?

969
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,210
That is for you to decide.

970
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,126
What?

971
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,084
Unhand her, you cur.

972
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,251
Oh, so the little prince has grown
a backbone?

973
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,884
Allow me to help you with that.

974
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,084
I destroyed your father
and I will destroy you.

975
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:00,211
Then I shall die like a king.

976
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,567
I have one more card to play.

977
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,246
Okay.

978
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,204
I'll just be here if you need me.

979
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,445
Trogowogs, listen to me.

980
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,806
The criminal Bane has altered your minds
to use you for his own evil ends.

981
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,727
But you can fight it.
Assert your free will.

982
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,247
I know you can do it.
I know you will choose peace.

983
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,646
Thanks awfully.

984
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,963
But I think instead
we shall obliterate you completely.

985
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,208
- Don't you think we should?
- You know I do.

986
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,802
Just to show there's no hard feelings,
have you any final words?

987
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,805
Just one...

988
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:57,802
Batoosie, Batoosie, Batoosie.

989
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,441
Huh?

990
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,409
I didn't see this coming.

991
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,683
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Hey, look at Grungle go.

992
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,889
He's so small, Bane can't even touch him.

993
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,930
Yes, Prince Grungle has passed his test.

994
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,608
If only the other Trogowogs
could see him now.

995
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,644
Yeah, of course. The Psyche Stone.

996
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,689
- Nightwing.
- Got it, let's do it.

997
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,410
Here, kid.
Walk softly and carry a big stick.

998
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,651
That is a very small stick
and I am a very big man.

999
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,246
No!

1000
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,089
You're finished, Bane.

1001
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:48,808
I may no longer be grande
but you will find I am still supreme.

1002
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,647
I say, Prince Grungle is certainly
no slouch in the fisticuffs department.

1003
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,344
Bane, however folded like a cloth napkin.

1004
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,811
Good show.

1005
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,122
Encore, encore.

1006
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,811
Oh, I see.

1007
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:38,962
You knew the Psyche Stone would eventually
steal the forbidden move from your mind.

1008
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,681
So you simply added
a mental suggestion to dance.

1009
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,601
Activated when I said the word "Batoosie."

1010
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,562
Well played, Batface.

1011
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,166
Not bad.

1012
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,131
Not exactly martial arts, but not bad.

1013
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,771
My only question,
why is Strokedeath not dancing?

1014
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,171
Madame Mantis,
even with your incomplete teaching,

1015
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,966
I have become
the world's greatest mercenary.

1016
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,284
But there is still one thing
Deathstroke cannot and will not do.

1017
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,126
Dance.

1018
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,441
What?

1019
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,609
No wonder you're so bad.

1020
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,882
Dancing is good for the soul.

1021
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,767
You come back to my dojo.
It is also Madame Mantis' dance academy.

1022
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,044
The forbidden move has been erased.

1023
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,684
Yep, that's the last of them.

1024
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,549
Back to their little peace-loving lives
in their little secret cave.

1025
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,966
Batgirl... A moment?

1026
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,691
Here comes Prince Charming.
I've got to go...

1027
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,765
Do something...

1028
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,725
Somewhere...

1029
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,803
You have my eternal gratitude.

1030
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,804
You saved both my people and myself.

1031
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,764
Hey, you saved your kingdom,

1032
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,890
and from the sound of things,
I think your people agree.

1033
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,885
Batgirl, you're beautiful, you're brave,

1034
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,931
and what's more,
you inspire me to be brave.

1035
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,881
I want nothing more than to go with you
and stay by your side forever.

1036
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,809
Oh, that is so sweet, Prince Grungle.

1037
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,925
Um, you are really wonderful, but...

1038
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,643
Unfortunately, I am now king,

1039
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,770
and my needs are always secondary
to those of my subjects.

1040
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,082
Alas, here I must remain.

1041
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,448
As for Bane, he will now reside
in our dungeon, forever captive.

1042
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,162
Not unlike my heart.

1043
01:12:34,807 --> 01:12:36,976
Oh, stop.

1044
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,128
Well, Deathstroke,
now that your honor has been restored...

1045
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,250
Look. Batface, our little class reunion

1046
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:53,405
has been just great,
but we're still not friends.

1047
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,163
And when next we meet,
it will be as true equals.

1048
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,201
That went well.

1049
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,249
He may not be a hero, Nightwing,

1050
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,966
but Deathstroke once again
walks the path of honor.

1051
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,724
And that may be enough.

1052
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,401
Outsmarted by an oversized boy scout.
I'll never live it down.

1053
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,080
Never, never, never!

1054
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,646
Well, that's the last of them.

1055
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,322
Behind the walls of a completely reliable
mental health facility.

1056
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,006
And not a moment too soon. Look.

1057
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,161
Hi, guys.

1058
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,569
- Robin, listen...
- I know.

1059
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,081
Don't worry.

1060
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,368
There's really no reason
to let Batman know how...

1061
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,444
How Superman released all the inmates
from Arkham Asylum?

1062
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,206
The Joker outsmarted Superman
with a spoon?

1063
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,682
How the super-criminals almost succeeded
in the wrecking of the city?

1064
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,047
Yes, yes, that's it exactly.

1065
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,646
Batman. Welcome home, Dark Knight.

1066
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,041
Any trouble while I was away?

1067
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,201
No.

1068
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,125
Well, I mean, you know,
I mean, nothing out of the ordinary.

1069
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,328
I, uh...

1070
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,126
I cannot tell a lie!

1071
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,362
Joker outsmarted me with a spoon

1072
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,801
and tricked me into releasing
Arkham's criminals

1073
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,770
who almost succeeded
in wrecking Gotham City.

1074
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,886
It's true, Gotham's criminals are
an entirely new level of weird.

1075
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,724
They almost turned us into soup.

1076
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,522
Don't worry, I anticipated every part
of that, except the spoon.

1077
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,009
All that matters now is that
the city is safe once again

1078
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,889
thanks to the four of you.

1079
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,447
Excellent rescue
at Joker's Fun House, Robin.

1080
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,085
Great job, kid.

1081
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,244
I set a pretty high standard
when I was Robin,

1082
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,767
but you're taking it to a whole new level.

1083
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,288
Thanks, Nightwing. Thanks, Batman.

1084
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,920
But how did you know what happened
at Joker's Fun House?

1085
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,600
Because I'm...

1086
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,247
Batface.

1087
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,401
- Uh...
- Huh?

1088
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,450
And so ends another heroic adventure.

1089
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,609
Justice has been served

1090
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,890
and our beloved Gotham City
is once again safe.

1091
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,805
Thanks to...
