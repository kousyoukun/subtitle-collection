1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:04,054
(Eerie music)

2
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,238
(Eerie music grows louder)

3
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,660
<i>(Man)
Adam and Eve just had sex, right.</i>

4
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,488
<i>And God says to Adam,
"Where's Eve?"</i>

5
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,041
<i>So Adam says, "She's down
at the stream, washing off."</i>

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:37,667
<i>God says, "Damn, now I'll never get
that smell out of those fish."</i>

7
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,373
(Group of people laughing)

8
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,504
<i>(Woman) You really think
that's funny, don't you?</i>

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,302
<i>I bet every man here
thinks that's funny.</i>

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,554
<i>(Man) Ease up, huh?
All of you. Women, Christ!</i>

11
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,135
<i>Getting to be a real pain in the ass.
You know that?</i>

12
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,346
<i>I don't know what's wrong
with the way it used be</i>

13
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,430
<i>when you just did what you were told?</i>

14
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,232
<i>(Woman)
Fuck you, Hopper.</i>

15
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,060
(Man) <i>I do, every night.
Me and my jar of Vaseline.</i>

16
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,147
<i>I can fuck any woman I want.
I don't even have to make her cum.</i>

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>(Woman) Really? I'd rather get fucked
by</i> a <i>vibrator than your cock any day.</i>

18
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,288
<i>It's honest, loving and I don't have
to make breakfast for it in the morning.</i>

19
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,489
(Laughter)

20
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,328
You remind me of my ex-wife.
She had an answer for everything.

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,879
Like whenever people
would ask her what I did.

22
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,456
She'd say, "He struggles."

23
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,133
(Woman) You guys,
you all think you are the victim.

24
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,178
Hey, wait a minute.
I think we're taking a bum rap here.

25
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,096
I happen to be a very giving lover.

26
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,051
(Woman) Yeah, you're giving alright.
You gave half the city the clap.

27
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,104
- (Laughter)
- (Man) Alright, enough.

28
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,432
Mr Grady.
You've been awfully quiet.

29
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:43,066
I know it's your first night with the group
but is there anything you'd like to say.

30
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:49,778
No, I just came as a guest.
My buddy Hopper over here brought me.

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,865
(Man) I know. But surely you must
have something to say about all this.

32
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,416
I mean, you are planning
to stay with us?

33
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,916
Me? Why, me, I'm happy.

34
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,882
Been married to the same woman
for 11 years.

35
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,127
Been together since high school.
We have two kids.

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,680
(Woman) Cut the crap. You wouldn't be
here if something wasn't bugging you.

37
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,511
I told you, I'm here with Hopper.
I have a great marriage.

38
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:20,228
I don't understand all these...
hang-ups with you people.

39
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,564
I've never cheated on my wife
in ten years.

40
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,271
(Woman) I thought it was 11?

41
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,574
(Woman 2) I've never met a man
yet who'd admit he was a lousy lay.

42
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,949
What's that supposed to mean?
You think everything has to do with sex?

43
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,327
(Woman) Admit it. You're a lousy lay
and she's learn t to accept it.

44
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,579
- (Woman 2) Like we all had to.
- Wait a minute!

45
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,248
- You think I'm a lousy lay?
- (Woman) You got it.

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,051
I'm not the one who complains
how tired I am every night.

47
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,843
Getting her to make love...

48
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,014
It's like asking her to run
the Boston Marathon.

49
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,309
And then when we actually
go through with it,

50
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,807
I don't know whether
to embrace her or embalm her.

51
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,480
So don't tell me that I'm a lousy lay.

52
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,270
What am I saying?
What the hell am I doing here?

53
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,606
(High pitched trumpet)

54
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,743
Oh, thank you, ladies and gentleman.

55
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,035
(Gentle music)

56
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,786
I'm grateful
from the bottom of my heart.

57
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:23,086
It is truly an honour
to be named Miss Liberty 1984.

58
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,549
I have dreamed
of this moment all my life.

59
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:32,630
And I promise I shall carry the name
with dignity and with pride.

60
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:38,936
I will always serve my country
and be a shining beacon of hope

61
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,308
to nations the world over.

62
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:48,192
Spreading the true spirit
of freedom and liberty that is America.

63
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,443
(Man)
Oh, we're proud of you, Miss Liberty.

64
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,944
(Giggles)

65
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,196
What do you plan to do
with your scholarship money?

66
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,997
Well. I plan to study music, sir.

67
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,497
Music, do you say?
What kind of instrument do you play?

68
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,499
I play the flute, sir.

69
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:09,800
In honour of our forefathers
who died at Concord and Lexington.

70
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,133
Would you like to see
how Miss Liberty plays the flute?

71
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,307
Oh, yes. Yes, very much.

72
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,104
First, I unzip the case.

73
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:31,440
And then I take out the instrument
very carefully. I'm very gentle.

74
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,401
And then I run my little hand all over it.

75
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:40,035
Up and down. Then up and down.

76
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:47,079
(Seductive) And then I fondle it so softly.
So softly.

77
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,756
(Groans)

78
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,754
I love the look of it.

79
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:59,767
Oh, I love the feel of it.
So smooth and firm.

80
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,605
I like to wrap my fingers around it
and tenderly caress it.

81
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,363
Then I like to lift it to my mouth.

82
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,705
And wrap my lips around it.

83
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:29,247
And then I just wait for that sweet,
sweet music to come pouring out.

84
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,546
(Ecstatic cries)

85
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,626
Fucking incredible. Oh!

86
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,335
(Soft rock music)

87
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,602
(Panting)

88
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,268
(Low repetitive grunts)

89
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,576
(Sniffing)

90
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,507
(Loud ecstatic groan)

91
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,712
Fucking incredible!

92
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,421
(Music grows louder)

93
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,638
Fucking incredible!

94
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,014
I knew it would be.

95
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,317
You knew it would be too, didn't you?
Ha-ha.

96
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,696
We know each other so well.
You know what I mean?

97
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,734
What did you say your name was?

98
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,161
China Blue.

99
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,995
No, I mean your real name.

100
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,377
Miss Liberty.

101
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,832
Well, that was some game of yours,
Miss Liberty!

102
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,509
You wanted romance.

103
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,214
My name is Carl
and I just split up with my wife.

104
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,469
It's gettin'' late babe. Got to move.

105
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,056
Can I see you again?

106
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,684
I work the street. Keep an eye out.

107
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,022
It's just that it's been so long
since I got a hard-on just...

108
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,691
...looking at someone.

109
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,782
We were married 12 years.

110
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,616
She just walked out on me.
Just like that.

111
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,702
I don't know what it was I did wrong.

112
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,662
I know what you mean.

113
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,215
My ex beat it out the door
when he was tired of beating me.

114
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,917
Is that true?

115
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,505
Does it matter?

116
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,562
Yeah, well.
I'll see you around, China Blue.

117
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,266
Oh, put the cash on the dresser.

118
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,811
(Door creaks shut)

119
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,781
(Gentle gasp)

120
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,450
(Loud upbeat music)

121
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,493
(Sniffs)

122
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,096
Hey! Shit!

123
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,312
(Eerie electronic music)

124
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:37,564
"Dear God! The heathen are come
unto thine inheritance.

125
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,896
"Thy holy temple, have they defiled.

126
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,198
"They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

127
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,447
"Their blood have they shed
like water round Jerusalem."

128
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,325
- Like, like, like...
- (Man in background) This guy is crazy.

129
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,284
They fuck and they piss and they shit
like the fucking scum they are.

130
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,663
(Laughter in the background)

131
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:59,715
Dear God, hallowed is Thy name...
In the spirit of Lucifer.

132
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,962
Forgive me Lord. Forgive me.

133
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,969
How long, Lord,
shalt thou be angry forever?

134
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,471
Shall they jealously burn like fire?

135
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,602
Shall we keep on
fucking and pissing into this.

136
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,728
(Sobbing)

137
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:23,439
Forgive me, Lord.
That was... that was not me.

138
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,612
(Gentle saxophone music)

139
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,418
You child, victim of the night.

140
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,542
I am the Reverend Peter Shayne
and I know the plague that cripples you.

141
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:44,172
I've been sent by the Lord to save you
and to rid the earth of that plague.

142
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,127
I am His holy messenger.

143
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,173
(Music grows louder)

144
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,468
Do you recognise me, child?

145
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,976
Sorry, I never forget a face.

146
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,524
Especially when I've sat on it.

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,819
(Discordant music)

148
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,190
(Sinister laughter)

149
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,028
- Save your soul, whore.
- Save your money, shithead.

150
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,832
(Discordant music)

151
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,764
(Gentle electronic music)

152
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,557
I'm sorry, man. I didn't think
they'd come down on you so hard.

153
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,769
Forget it. Come on in and see the shop.
You haven't seen it for a while.

154
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,316
- (Loud voice) Hey, Jerry!
- Good to see you, Grady.

155
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,868
How come you're still here?
I thought Mollie was sick.

156
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,945
They're coming
to pick this up tomorrow.

157
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,076
Can't afford to lose customers,
you know.

158
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,376
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll finish it up. Now, get out of here.

159
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,454
- Your wife is sick. You should be home.
- Well, thanks, Grady.

160
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,585
You know, you're the only one left
who gives a damn.

161
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,588
<i>'</i> What do
- erry!

162
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,728
- Step on it.
- (Nervous laughter)

163
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,056
What you afraid of? Step on it!

164
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,943
(Recorded voice)
Got you surrounded.

165
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,023
- Still playing games?
- It'll scare the hell out of any thief.

166
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,450
<i>Do not attempt to escape.
Keep your hands up.</i>

167
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,280
Bobby, about that session.
Things must be pretty rough at home.

168
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,833
Things are great.
Just got a little wound up, that's all.

169
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,662
Like I said, still playing games.

170
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,295
You should talk. All the bodies
floating in and out of that bed.

171
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,423
That's some kind of life, pal.
Spend half of it changing sheets.

172
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,928
Sheila called me yesterday
for the first time since the divorce.

173
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,052
Still can't let her go, Bobby.

174
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,308
(Bobby) Well, I got a great idea.

175
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,187
Amy invited Sheila to the barbecue
on Sunday with Tommy and Patty.

176
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,940
So why don't you come?
It'll just be like old times.

177
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,943
(Energetic drum music)

178
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,610

Who's there?

(Grunting)

190
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,825
I didn't hurt you, did I?

191
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,495
A little rougher this time
than usual.

192
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,704
Don't worry, 'sweet dick'. I'm tough.

193
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,161
"Sweet dick"?

194
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,749
Do me a favour next time.
Don't walk so fast. Hard to keep up.

195
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,922
Maybe I should rape you, huh?

196
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,379
One way to get back at your old man.

197
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,885
- Sorry?
- Your father.

198
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,262
I know he raped you
when you were a kid.

199
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,811
You told me the first time
we were at it together.

200
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,139
<i>Oh, yeah. I forgot.</i>

201
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,977
- <i>You said</i> you <i>trusted me.</i>
- <i>I do. You're the only one I told.</i>

202
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,895
It is true, isn't it?

203
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,901
- Sure it's true.
- Well, you don't seem too upset.

204
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,031
You were almost in tears
when you told me.

205
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:07,241
I'm trying to block it out of my mind.
Can't you understand?

206
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,873
I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was still a sore spot.

207
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,579
Not as sore as it was then.

208
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,630
(Laughs)

209
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:23,223
Maybe, if you're real nice to me
I'll tell you all about the time

210
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,221
he tied my arms to the bed
with black twine.

211
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,644
Did he really do that?

212
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,438
He did that
to a sweet little thing like you?

213
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,391
See the scars.

214
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,228
- Where?
- Look closer.

215
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,072
Oh, yeah. I see.

216
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,989
How low can you get?

217
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,284
As low as you can afford.
And your meter's up pal.

218
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,585
That's the bitter truth.

219
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,754
Can I keep these?

220
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,877
For ten bucks.

221
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,254
Keep the trust.

222
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,936

(Door slams shut)

226
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,343
I'm sorry I'm late honey.
I had to finish up.

227
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,302
- I ate with the kids.
- Well, I brought dessert.

228
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,230
- Thanks. You know I'm on a diet.
- Open it.

229
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,898
Da-da!

230
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,029
- (Loud crunch)
- Have you eaten?

231
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm not hungry.
I'll fix something later.

232
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,987
Dinner's still warm.

233
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,698
Listen, I invited Donny
to the party on Sunday.

234
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,829
You know, he and Sheila
have been speaking.

235
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,082
- Or at least she called him.
- Are you crazy?

236
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,256
She only called him
'cause he was late with the alimony.

237
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,092
So how are the kids?

238
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,928
Jimmy needs braces. The dentist
says he has an overlapping bite.

239
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,428
Will they hurt?

240
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,478
I'm not concerned
whether it will hurt or not.

241
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,268
Well, if he needs braces, honey,
give him the braces.

242
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,738
- Just like that.
- Yeah, just like that.

243
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,988
So we'll go another year without
a hot tub. We can use Larson's.

244
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,947
Sure, and when we need a new car
we can just borrow the Murphys'.

245
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,533
I can borrow my sister's Cuisinart
and Sally's microwave.

246
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,086
And Kathy just got a new video recorder.
It cost 1,000 bucks.

247
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,710
She says it'll do anything she wants.

248
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,383
Well, for that price,
she should go down on him.

249
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,299
Very funny.

250
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,685
Did you talk to Jerry?

251
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,273
So where's the salt?

252
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,442
- You didn't, did you?
- Don't we have any salt?

253
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,611
- Bobby!
<i>'</i> Amy, I told you!

254
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,526
I am not letting the guy go.
I don't care how slow things are.

255
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,782
He's got a wife and kids.

256
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,364
And what do you have?

257
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,327
Maybe if you'd gone into a real business
like a normal person...

258
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,503
It's on the stove.

259
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,672
No wonder we never have any money!

260
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,093
Amy, look, I love that business.
I'm proud of it.

261
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,427
I work damn hard at it.
We'll make out OK.

262
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,853
Haven't let you down yet, have I?

263
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,728
So, who the hell needs a hot tub?
Who needs a bathtub?

264
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,988
Thinking of which,
why don't you and I...

265
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,075
...go upstairs
and take a bath together?

266
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,994
We could certainly use a bit
of adventure in our lives.

267
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,657
I'm really not in the mood
for a little adventure.

268
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,792
So what kind of lousy mood are you in?
Did you get your period today?!

269
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,840
No, I did not get my period today.

270
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,966
Every time I'm in a lousy mood,
you think I've got my period.

271
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,797
I wish.

272
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,929
By stocking Tampax I'll retire.

(Gentle electronic music)

274
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,697
There is nothing
that means more to me...

275
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,196
...than this family.

276
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,408
Not even some stupid hot tub.

277
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,295
I have to clean up.

(Upbeat music)

Hey! What are you guys still doing up?
Do you know what time it is?

280
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,272
Mum said we can stay up
till the next commercial.

281
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,190
No, you can't,

282
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,857
'cause you're under attack.
It's bombs away!

283
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,155
Watch out, here it comes!

284
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,586
Why don't you give your sister
time on it, cowboy?

285
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,379
Come on, you too. March, up!

286
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,332
Did you hear the joke about...?

287
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,670
Yeah, well don't worry about it,
because it's bedtime. Isn't it, Daddy?

288
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,013
- Come on. Let's go!
- Give Daddy a big hug.

289
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,567
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

- Great. You?

292
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,320
Yeah, I'm just fine, thanks.

293
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:24,705
Urn, listen. You asked me about doing
some night time surveillance for you.

294
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,082
<i>Yes. Do you think
you might still be interested?</i>

295
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:32,383
Yeah. Well, I was wondering
is the offer still good?

296
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,335
<i>You got to work nights, though.</i>

297
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,924
No problem. I could use the money.

- You do? Terrific.</i>

- No, <i>I</i> didn't.

301
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,446
Neither did I.
I guess it just comes with poverty.

and you take it easy.

Well, I'll put them to bed.

What, and keep them up
half the night with your stories?

It's good for the imagination.

309
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,090
Theirs or yours?

310
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,471
I'm going to be doing
some tracking for Walt Pierson,

311
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,555
so it means you can make room
for that hot tub.

312
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:32,902
You act like I've... forced you.
I don't even want it anymore.

313
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,739
Well, what do you want?
Do you know?

314
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,816
And you didn't force me.

315
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,993
(TV on in background)

316
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,540
Maybe I'll do the magic act at the party.

317
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,292
You know, for laughs.
What do you think?

318
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,596
Whatever you want.

319
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,263
(I "it's a Lovely Life", Rick Wakeman,
based on "New World", Antonio Dvorék)

320
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,139
Oh, Bobby, come on. Stop it.
We just got the cable.

321
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,022
Walt Pierson speaks very highly of you.

322
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,197
I've a lot of respect for Walt.
His word's good enough for me.

323
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:45,651
I'm damn good at what I do, Mr Bateman,
but I'll only take a job if I can do it right.

324
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,705
As long as you keep it quiet. I don't
want to turn this into a major event.

325
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,829
I've always been a pushover
for industrial espionage.

326
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,287
I'd like to help you.
Just tell me what the facts are.

327
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:02,173
I'm one of the largest manufacturers of
ladies' sportswear outside of New York,

328
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,721
but I'm falling behind
for the first time in 2O years.

329
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,720
Last week's orders
were at an all-time low.

330
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,474
I believe someone
in my organisation is selling patterns

331
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,226
to one of my competitors.

332
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,478
- I want you to follow her.
- Who is she?

333
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,560
The young woman's
been with me about two years.

334
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,738
Very talented designer.
Hell of a future, if she hasn't blown it.

335
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,942
- What makes you think it's her?
- I don't know. Gut feeling.

336
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,574
There's something about her.
I'll point her out to you.

337
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,247
Try and save some yardage
in the sleeve, OK?

338
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,074
(Pierson) That's her, in the grey suit.

339
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,537
(Bobby) How could someone
that looks like that be a criminal?

340
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,465
That's what I'm paying you to find out.

341
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,464
Follow her, where she goes at night,
what she does.

342
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,887
- Morning, Lou.
- Phil.

343
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,345
What do you mean,
"there's something about her"?

344
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,268
She's a mystery. Divorced.
Lives alone.

345
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,687
No boyfriends I know of. A real loner.

346
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,937
- What's she like in here?
- Impulsive, ambitious.

347
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,734
Never stops working,
never satisfied.

348
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,811
You know the type.
Always proving themselves.

349
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,398
- Perfection or bust.
- Any friends?

350
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,483
She gets along fine
with the other women.

351
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,445
But if you've got a penis,
you're in trouble. She turns to ice.

352
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,531
- That still doesn't make her a criminal.
- It makes her a suspect.

353
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:17,790
I don't trust anyone that works that hard.
She must be hiding something.

354
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,963
- I want you to nail her lily white ass.
- What the hell is this?

355
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,009
- You think she's that dangerous?
- It depends on what you discover.

356
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,557
(Whistling)

357
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,406
(Electronic music
of the same tune being whistled)

358
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,827
(Car screeches)

359
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,204
(Music continues)

360
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,267
(Door slams)

361
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,437
Paradise Hotel. 4th and Main.

362
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,201
(Car engine starts)

363
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,543
(Woman) Hey, this is a fucking pain
in my ass.

364
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,145
(Gentle electronic music)

365
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,867
(Soft saxophone music)

366
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,470
(Sirens in background)

367
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:23,559
- Do you recognise me tonight, child?
- Ha! Well, if it isn't my saviour!

368
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:29,230
The Reverend Peter Shayne requests
a few moments of repose upstairs,

369
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,152
in your holy of holies.

370
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,276
A reverend, no less.

371
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:39,203
You know, the last reverend who
tried t0, er, save me... lived to regret it.

372
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,407
I chased him all around the church
until I caught him by the organ.

373
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,241
(Organ playing
"Onward, Christian Soldiers")

374
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,418
- Come on.
- (Laughs)

375
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,376
I make a great Joan of Arc.
Can't you tell?

376
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,757
I imagine you do spend a good deal
of your time on your knees, my child.

377
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,389
(Organ music continues)

378
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,601
Excuse us.
We've got business to conduct here.

379
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,942
Hi, baby! How about a shot
of the Grand Canyon, huh?

380
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,902
Holy shit!

381
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,791
(Playful electronic music)

382
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,712
Stick it there, Rev.

383
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,544
What do you want?

384
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,048
I want t0 help you.
Admit you need it.

385
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,004
I need it.

386
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,057
With conviction.
Make me believe.

387
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,636
Oh, please, Reverend.
You're so good and wise and strong.

388
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,394
Please help this sick,
disgusting degenerate.

389
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,728
I deal in truth. I'm bringing you
something greater than a hard-on,

390
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,313
assuming you consider truth
to be greater than a hard-on.

391
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,069
(Clattering of coins on floor)

392
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,740
- Depends on the hard-on.
- Try it again, sinner.

393
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:14,131
First month I was married, I tried t0
make my husband's favourite casserole.

394
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,004
I made a mess.

395
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,212
So I cried to my best friend Peggy
all week about it,

396
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,888
till I found out that
when I was in the kitchen making it,

397
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,386
he was in the bedroom
making Peggy.

398
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,766
Don't stare at me.

399
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,475
You're wearing your anguish
like a breakaway chastity belt.

400
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,400
You wanted the truth.

401
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,729
What else are you selling?

402
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,075
This is a fantasy business, Reverend.

403
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,245
You can have any truth you want.

404
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,574
And so can you.
Isn't that why you're here?

405
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,628
- Isn't that why you are?
- I'm here to save you.

406
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,922
Why don't you fuck me?
That'll save me.

407
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,920
Not from your disease.

408
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,344
What disease?
I'm healthy as a horse.

409
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,549
I'm fit as a fiddle and ready for cock.

410
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,226
Whores and metaphors don't mix.
Who are you?

411
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,271
I'm Cinderella, Cleopatra,

412
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:15,226
Goldie Hawn, Eva Braun.
I'm Little Miss Muffin, Pocahontas.

413
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,310
I'm whoever you want me to be,
Reverend.

414
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,692
But what are you doing here?

415
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,820
- Satisfying.
- Who?

416
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,745
- I think the confessional is about over.
- Don't you want to be saved?

417
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,868
- Do you get that much out of this?
- I get paid.

418
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,951
I'm not interested in what you're selling,
only what you're buying.

419
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,832
Why don't you assume
the missionary position, Reverend?

420
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,039
My purpose here is totally humanitarian.

421
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,377
- To make me see the light?
- To make you see through the bullshit.

422
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,555
<i>You want truth, Father?
I give the best truth in town.</i>

423
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,973
<i>So good, you wouldn't
know it from make believe.</i>

424
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,302
<i>- Is it?
- If you believe it is.</i>

425
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,481
Everybody needs something
to believe in, don't they, Reverend?

426
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,901
Bow down, 0 Lord, and hear me
for I am poor and needy.

427
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,479
Preserve my soul, for I am holy.

428
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,442
O Thou, my God.
Save thy servant, that trusteth in Thee.

429
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:09,655
Save him from this bigmouth cooze
with a motor driven ass.

430
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:14,039
Forgive me, Lord. I speak not in vain
but this little bitch provokes me so.

431
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,042
Oh, Jesus!
At least I can stay in character.

432
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,547
You couldn't even get a walk-on, unless
it was you that was being walked on.

433
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,720
I am a messenger of God,
you little cocksucker!

434
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,796
What's this, your mail bag?
Let's see what's in it

435
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,927
No!

436
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,384
- What is this, top secret?
- No.

437
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,265
Let Mama have a little peak.

438
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,847
What have you got in here,
the Holy Grail?

439
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:40,186
Oh, my God! Oh, excuse me, oh God!

440
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,818
Need I remind you, Jezebel,
that curiosity killed the cat.

441
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,400
Not until it got out of the bag.

442
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,487
These are the Devil's playthings.
Those who touch them will burn.

443
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,493
Put another log on the fire, Reverend.
Let's see a sample.

444
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,293
- It's a disgusting array.
- Disgusting's my middle name, honey.

445
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,747
- What have you got in the bag?
- God, forgive me.

446
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,672
A tit pacifier.

447
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,880
That milk of human kindness,
remedial, even in simulation.

448
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:14,808
A foam rubber pretty kitty, already house
broken. You can teach it new tricks.

449
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,935
It comes with a battery pack.
It's in here somewhere.

450
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,101
An auto-suck.

451
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,984
Modern technology at its most
compassionate, and it swallows.

452
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,033
This one is a little on the blink.

453
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:33,330
Oh, are you hungry? How about
a beat-me-eat-me liquorice whip?

454
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,284
The taste that leaves its mark forever.

455
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:40,621
Hey, no. Wait a minute.
I'm not through here. What else you got?

456
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,416
What?

457

- (Sudden burst of sinister organ music)
- What the hell?

458
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,849
Is this a cruise missile or a Pershing?

459

What are you gonna do?
Fuck someone to death?

462
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,531
You'd like to, wouldn't you?

463
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,829
Only the right woman.

464
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,660
I've got to go.

465
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,834
Just when we're making progress.

466
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,832
I can only handle
one revelation a night.

467
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,711
Enough of them
and you might be able to handle real life.

468
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,384
Real life, Reverend?

469
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,680
Tell me your name,
or is that a tough one?

470
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,760
China Blue.

471
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:40,393
I like it. It's rather exotic,
like something out of Charlie Chan.

472
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,725
B-movies have always
been my inspiration.

473

<i>What's yours'?
Going My Way?</i>

474
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,907
All you need to know about me
is that I intend to save you.

475
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,653
And all you need to do is... be there.

476
00:35:56,196 --> 00:36:00,576
Stay with me, China Blue.
Trust me. I'll free you.

477
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,043
Who are you?
You're not a Reverend. Who are you?

478
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,796
<i>I'm you.</i>

484

I know her cowardly game.</i>

only feel strength behind her facade.</i>

will I cut off."

492
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,387
I'll cut off, alright.

493
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,470
I'll cut off... her little tits.

494
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,820
(Gentle electronic music)

495
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,745
Why didn't you come to me, Phil?
I would have loaned you the money.

496
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,673
- Hell, I would have given you the money.
- Goddamn pride.

497
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,592
What about jail? No pride in there.

498
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,798
Who thinks? Cooper offered me
a fortune for the patterns.

499
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,224
I lost control!

500
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,558
Please, Lou.
I'll work for nothing.

501
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,898
Anything you want.

502
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,944
What this would do
to Sarah and my boy...

503
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,899
- (Phone rings in the background)
- I'll have to think about it, Phil.

504
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:42,259
I had to have someone around here
to talk to about this whole damn thing.

505
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,758
The man's been with me 18 years.
I trusted him.

506
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:51,392
He was so moved that I did
that he broke down and confessed.

507
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,141
That's gratitude for you.

508
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,814
I didn't know my trust meant that much.

509
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,771
What do I do now?

510
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,450
- Give him another chance.
- The man is a criminal.

511
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,653
Come on. You heard his motive.

512
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:12,410
The guy's only human.
He knows he was wrong.

513
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:16,584
God knows we've all made mistakes.
Why ruin his life over one mistake?

514
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,833
- What about the law?
- Screw the law.

515
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,464
What good is he in jail?

516
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,168
Beside, he'll work twice
as hard for you here.

517
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,596
And you can feel like the king of hearts.

518
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,554
I don't know
what's right or wrong anymore.

519
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,355
- Did you really believe it was her?
- So I'm a lousy guesser.

520
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,353
What did you get on her?

521
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,645
Not much. She stayed home all night.

522
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,189
(Knocking)

523
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,243
- Is that you, Joe?
- (Man) Are you <i>free?</i>

524
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,449
No, but I'm one hell of a bargain.

525
00:42:55,531 --> 00:43:00,128
I meant, are you available.
You know... for action.

526
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:05,505
Action? Soldier, for 5O bucks,
you can name your own battlefield.

527
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:19,355
I'm sorry! I'm not too good at this.
It's my first time.

528
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,650
Oh? Are you that desperate
or that horny?

529
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,897
- I'm married.
- Oh, that desperate and that horny.

530
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,114
Go slow! I'm just... a boy scout.

531
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:37,791
(Laughs) Well, baby,
you are about to become an explorer.

532
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,084
Oh, hot body!

533
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,673
- Are you an athlete?
- Yeah.

534
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,965
Played varsity football, high school.

535
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,019
- Quarterback.
- Mm.

536
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:03,020
Well, Quarterback,
you can have the ride of your life,

537
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,851
if you trust me at the wheel.

539
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,278
Sit down.

540
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,740
How, er, good a driver are you?

541
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,574
Who said anything about driving?
Driving's what you do with your wife.

542
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,000
Here, we fly.

543
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,918
Sound good, lover?

544
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,463
Bet you and your wife
haven't done much flying, right?

545
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,883
Shit, me and my wife haven't
been doing much driving lately.

546

Who are you?

550
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,943
It's not a prom date, sweetie.
I'm a hooker, you're a trick.

551
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,241
Why ruin a perfect relationship?

552
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,453
Here, have a Quaalude.

553
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,957
To float. You'll love it, I promise.
Flyer never lies.

Fasten your seatbelt, honey,

556
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,765

00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,674
Just leave me alone.

611
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,755
I would if I thought you wanted me to.

612
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,432
Get out.

613
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,350
Women, you mystify me.

614
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:44,681
The extremes you go to for a little
validation, but you still go home alone.

615
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,818
What's your mystery, Reverend?

616
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,987
Authority never reveals itself.

617
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,064
Huh. Why?

618
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:59,154
Are you afraid I'll stop believing,
or afraid you will?

619
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,831
Those are the rules.
My 50, my game, my rules.

620
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,579
Game's over, fraud.

621
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,632
The game's never over.

622
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,835
That's what you're here for, isn't it?

623
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,547
- I don't feel like playing games.
- I think you do.

624
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,802
Consider the alternative.

625
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:25,638
You want a game? Go sit down!

Give it to me. It's all a game.

633
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,961
Fly! Do what you want!
You want freedom?

634
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,038
You need to manipulate
women to feel like a man?

635
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,748
Do it! That's what we're here for.

636
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,833
Like you manipulate men
to feel like a woman?

637
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:56,919
- Let go, damn you.
- Why, it's only a game.

638
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,845
- Let go, I said.
- It hurts, doesn't it?

639
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,969
- Let go, you fuck!
- Tell me it hurts.

640
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,516
Yes, it hurts!

641
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,014
You see, you can feel.

How was it, huh? Not bad?

647

PhD in emotionalism, huh?

648
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,794
I have accepted reality.
I'm cured.

649
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,719
Free at last!

650
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,172
Shit!

651
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,054
You self-righteous son of a bitch!

652
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,601
I can play your goddamn game
as well as you can

653
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,476
and I don't use religion
t0 pump myself up.

654
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,275
If you're a minister, I'm Snow White.

655
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,105
Yes, but, what fun
it is playing the part.

656
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,361
- Would you leave now, please?
- That was quite a performance.

657
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,534
There's no limit t0 my talents.

658
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,112
You're the head of your class,
or is it the...

659
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,540
- ...class of your head?
- Oh, a man of words.

660
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,869
He makes up in diction
what he lacks in click.

661
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,798
Lesson for today.

662
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,501
I've written you a poem.
Would you like t0 hear it?

663
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,678
<i>Behold this wicked woman</i>

664
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:25,098
<i>She falls, she mends,
she crawls, she bends</i>

665
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,268
<i>She sucks it, fucks it,
picks it up and licks it</i>

666
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,313
<i>You can whip her, beat her,
maul her, mistreat her</i>

667
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,062
<i>Anything you want
as long as you don't touch her</i>

668
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:37,566
Get out of here. Take your
goddamn truth and get out of here!

669
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,646
Show her affection, she turns to stone.

670
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,607
You haven't had
your 50 dollars worth yet!

671
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,443
- Come back her, listen to me!
- Get away from me!

672
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:49,122
- Urgh! You...!
- Do you know what you are?

673
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:53,873
A cheap painted slut
who makes a fortune selling illusions.

674
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,750
Ah!

675
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,666
One of your regulars, my dear?

676
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,626
Rather eager tonight, isn't he?

677
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:09,719
I guess I taught that guy a lesson.

678
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:13,681
That was no guy.
That was my saviour.

679
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,277
I've never been fought over before.
Only been fought.

680
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,777
Yeah, well, it's tough work.
You can't please everyone.

681
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,530
Oh, I didn't mean this work.
In this work, I can please everyone.

682
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,988
Come on. What are you still doing
hanging around here anyway?

683
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,870
It's OK. I'm not helpless.

684

(Gentle electronic music)

685
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,329
I guess I could use some help.

686
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:45,508
Thanks for the help just then.
Or the attempt anyway.

687
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,760
Yeah, we're not all out t0 get you.

688
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,098
Now go on home to your wife.

689
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,817
I wish I could tell her,

690
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,441
the way you made me feel.

691
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,190
She'll say it's part of my imagination.

692
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,910
It was.

693
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,341
Can I have another pancake?

694
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,426
No, you cannot have another pancake.

695
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:36,264
You had two already.
Fat girls do not get married.

696
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,189
Bobby, are you OK?

697
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,021
What? Yeah, I'm fine.

698
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,359
Did you do something to your hair?

699
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,832
Yeah, I cut it last week.
Glad you noticed.

700
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,003
Excuse me. Here you go, Dad.

701
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,629
When are you going to fix
my garbage disposal?

702
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,836
I'll have a look at it.
It might need a plumber.

703
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,386
You can fix it, Dad.

704
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,432
Daddy, will you teach me
how to plant a garden?

705
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,055
Why me, Kiddo? Your mom'll teach you.

706
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,228
Daddy doesn't know
how to plant a garden.

707
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,185
Amy, it's really not that hard.

708
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,982
Honey, easy!
You know I don't like maple syrup.

709
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,404
Of course you like maple syrup.

710
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:28,107
When have you known me
t0 like maple syrup?

711
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,238
I don't want to argue with you.

712
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,365
I'm not arguing.

713
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,572
Dad, what's strontium-90.

714
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,748
It's a term for a radioactive fallout.

715
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,451
- He asked me, Amy.
- I didn't think you'd know what it is.

716
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,208
- Of course I know what it is.
- What is it?

717
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,382
It's a term for a radioactive fallout.

718
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:48,301
Brilliant. Isn't your daddy brilliant?

719
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:54,429
- What does the 90 mean?
- Yeah, hon, what does the 90 mean?

720
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:57,387
Tell us, Daddy, hm? You're the expert.

721
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,265
It means... that er...

722
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:06,695
...that you have 90 days
to get an antidote or you die.

I think you'd better ask
your teacher, Jimmy.

01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,162
I've got to get to work.

726
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,532
Daddy left food on his plate.

727
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,668
Daddy doesn't follow the rules.
He only makes them.

728
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,468
Goodbye. Give Daddy a kiss.

He's got so much stock already,

767
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,936
Guess who we just saw.
Janey Durant.

768
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,015
Remember, Amy? She beat you out
for head cheerleader.

769
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,442
- What a slut.
- She's not a slut.

770
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,315
She went to Ohio State.

771
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,238
Every two years they let a slut
into Ohio State.

772
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,692
Her timing was good.

773
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,655
I sat next to her in Biology.
She was always dropping her frog.

774
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:30,493
- What's she doing now?
- She's a waitress at Seafood Heaven.

775
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,374
- Didn't she marry Lenny Harris?
- That nerd?

776
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,797
He sat behind me in English
and tied mirrors to his shoes

777
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,795
so he could look up my dress.

778
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,127
Shit! What are you talking about?
That was me!

779
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,008
(Laughs) I knew it was some nerd.

780
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:45,014
It's OK. I've got one.

781
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,343
- Isn't it flat?
- I like it flat.

782
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,427
You never liked it flat
when we were married.

783
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,605
I never liked anything
when we were married.

784
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,478
OK, team. Get it while it's hot.

785
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,527
- (Laughter)
- He thinks he's still in high school.

786
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,318
Alright!

787
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,276
You've got mustard all over!

788
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,244
OK, everybody.
Look at me and smile.

789
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,163
One or the other. We can't do both.

790
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:14,662
(I "it's a Lovely Life", Rick Wakeman)

791
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,837
One more for posterity.

792
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,556
Promise me
you won't do the magic act.

793
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,688
- What? You told me you liked it.
- I lied.

794
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,861
Donny... Donny!

795
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,692
I think it's time for the old HP.
A little nostalgia for the gang.

796
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,197
You rat porker!

797
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:51,623
- Does Amy know?
- I thought I'd surprise her.

798
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:56,579
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention
please. We have a treat in store.

799
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,459
That dumb magic act.

800
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,131
It's no magic act.

801
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,882
Live on our stage,
direct from the wild jungles of Borneo...

802
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,840
Ah, damn! It's the old ace pick.

803
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,720
- (Laughs)
- Skill and daring,

804
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,847
ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves,

805
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,647
you're about t0 experience...
the human penis.

806
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:18,396
(Applause)

807
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,853
Bobby, don't. I mean it!

808
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:27,359
(Hums theme to
"2001: A Space Odyssey")

809
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:51,133
(Laughter)

810
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:59,975
(Music reaches crescendo)

811
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,733
(Applause)

812
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,734
Bravo, bravo!

813
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,541
Did your mother teach you
to wash your hands

814
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,797
after you go to the bathroom?

815
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,095
She taught me not to piss on my fingers.

816
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,932
- Did it feel good to get even?
- Did it feel good to lie?

817
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,186
I thought you liked the magic act.

818
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:43,144
I just didn't want to hurt your feelings.

819
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,228
I guess you can't win.

820
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:51,110
You can win by being honest with me
instead of humouring me.

821
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,659
What do we have
if we can't be honest with each other?

822
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,240
I don't know, Bobby. What do we have?

823
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,246
I don't know, Amy.

824
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,378
What else have you
been humouring me about?

825
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,750
Go to sleep.

826
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,629
No, I want to know what else
you've been sparing me from.

827
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:09,882
I'm really not in the mood for this.

828
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,840
Are you ever in the mood for anything?

829
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,722
Don't turn away from me.
I want to know what's bugging you.

830
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,644
Is it the way I eat?

831
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,725
Why did you pour
all that maple syrup on my pancakes?

832
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,435
It was a mistake, alright?

833
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,896
- Was it?
- What do you think?

834
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,903
I'm trying t0 poison you
with maple syrup?

835
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,323
If you're unhappy about something,
just tell me.

836
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,404
Don't take it out on me.

837
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:40,033
I'm really tired.

838
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,744
(Loud) No, damn it! Stop avoiding this.

839
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:48,626
You've been acting like
I have the plague or something.

840
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,587
I want to know
what the hell is bothering you.

841
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,720
Is it money again?

842
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,436
Nuclear war?

843
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:06,185
What about the way we make love,
if you can remember back that far?

844
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,941
All your ooh-ing and ah-ing.

845
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,149
Is that so you just
don't hurt my feelings?

846
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,576
- Stop!
- Come on, I want to know. Tell me.

847
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,997
- Bobby, don't do this.
- Tell me, damn it!

848
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,121
Be honest for once. I can take it.

849
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:26,000
Have you been getting off too?

850
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:30,209
- You've just been humouring me.
- I really hate this kind of talk.

851
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:36,840
It's not the HP
and it's not the magic act.

852
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,810
It's just us.

853
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,226
I want the truth.

854
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,456
You wanted the truth.

855
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,580
I'm sorry.

856
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,254
You're sorry.

857
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:11,253
(Crying) What do you want me to say?

858
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:23,390
Why couldn't you just tell me this before?

859
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,354
All this time
it hasn't been good for you.

860
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,232
Why did you have to lie about it?

861
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,073
(sighs)

862
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:43,039
I am your husband. Don't you think
I would care about something like that?

863
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,997
That I'd want to do something about it?

864
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:52,298
Didn't you trust me enough
to believe that?

865
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,215
(sighs)

866
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,646
I didn't say it wasn't good for me.

867
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:18,279
I just don't need the same thing
from it that you do.

868
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,445
It's never been important to me.

869
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:29,036
And you know
I feel funny talking about it.

870
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,496
Do you feel better faking it?

871
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,421
You were satisfied.

872
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,344
Satisfied?!

873
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:44,976
What do you think I am?
Some kind of machine?

874
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:47,600
That I just need a hole to cum in?

875
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:53,101
I mean, what do you think
makes me cum?

876
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,731
- Stop!
- No.

877
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,736
- What do you think makes me cum?
- I don't care!

878
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:06,911
I'll tell you. I thought it was
being inside the woman that I love.

879
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:12,542
And giving her as much pleasure
as she was giving to me.

880
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,125
You know, the two of us, together.

881
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:32,640
Some kind of magician I turned out to be.

882
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:38,146
So good, I conned myself.

883
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,654
Maybe it's time
we both stopped the conning.

884
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:50,082
Started learning again.

885
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:55,539
On our own.

886
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,336
(Knocking)

887
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:06,716
I know you're pissed, but before
you go crazy, just let me explain.

888
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,894
You followed me!
I don't fucking believe this.

889
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:13,018
I just want t0 talk t0 you.
I don't to make any trouble. I promise.

890
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:16,397
- I have to go to work.
- It won't take long. Please.

891
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,896
Thank you.

892
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,994
- Well?
- It's a great apartment.

893
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,323
What are you, a real estate agent?

894
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,953
I saw these in a book once.

895
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,924
They say that in the East,
it's forbidden to have sex with someone

896
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,094
who knows your secrets,
or shortcomings.

897
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,797
(Laughs) You'd never be horny there.

898
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,882
I'm never horny here.

899
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,222
I guess not.

900
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,178
Cut the crap.

901
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,935
What do you want from me?

902
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,437
What makes you think
I want something?

903
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,939
Everybody wants something.

904
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,192
Why did you come here?

905
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:05,237
I wanted to see you again.

906
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,581
Look, if you think you're gonna
get back in my panties forget it.

907
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,250
There's one asshole
in there already.

908
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,498
Maybe I just want to know you.

909
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,296
I mean, I've never met anyone like you.

910
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,340
Who has?

911
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:25,261
I just thought after last week
maybe we could be friends.

912
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,714
You really think we could be friends
after last week?

913
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:31,051
Yeah, I can't think of a better way
to start a friendship.

914
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,095
We haven't met. I'm Bobby Grady.

915
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,647
Joanna Crane, I saw it on the mailbox.

916
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:40,192
What are you, about 30?
Still call yourself Bobby?

917
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,771
- I'll grow up when I'm ready.
- Oh, I think you're ready.

918
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,532
Are you alone?

919
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,076
Aren't we all?

920
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:53,247
You remind me of this hamster I had
when I was a kid.

921
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,871
- I remind you of a hamster?
- Yep.

922
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:59,170
He ran away
whenever you tried to touch him.

923
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,748
So I wanted to show him
there's nothing to be afraid of.

924
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:04,380
So one day, I just picked him
real fast and I held him.

925
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:08,759
- And he turned tender and loving?
- No, he shit in my hand.

926
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,057
(Laughs)

927
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,478
Well, I'd better get going
'cause you're gonna be late for work.

928
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:19,308
It's OK. I'm used to breaking rules.
I'm a criminal at heart.

929
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,643
You meant you had one.

930
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:27,779
Thanks a lot, and I'm sorry
for busting in on you like this.

931
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:30,656
I really appreciate you listening
and I won't bother you again.

- (Door slams)
- Joanna Crane.

936
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,425
- Hello?
- (Phone rings off)

937
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:55,346
Hey, cowboy.

938
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

939
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,516
Dad, Morn said you've moved out.

940
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:08,360
Well, your mom and I,
we have to be on our own for a while.

941
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:13,195
I swear, that doesn't mean we've
stopped caring about you and Lisa.

942
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:19,626
Dad, if Mom gets married again, I don't
have to call the other guy Dad, do I?

943
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:27,501
Oh, Jimmy. No matter what happens,
I'm always gonna be your dad.

944
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,930
Why do you have to go?

945
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,638
Promise you won't be
any trouble t0 your mother.

946
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:39,311
- You watch out for your sister.
- (Child) Jimmy, come on!

947
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:42,310
- I will, don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

Hello, Joanna.

955
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,417
What are you doing here?
You have no right to be here.

956
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,590
I had to.

957
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,376
For both of us.

958
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,086
Get away from me.

959
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,514
I don't even want to know you.

960
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,637
No more deceptions, Joanna.

961
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:02,061
I know who you are.
We're the same, don't you see?

962
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,434
The same rage, the same fear.

963
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,982
We hurt the same,
we escape the same.

964
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:11,688
But we don't have to any more.
We have a chance. Both of us, together.

965
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:16,408
- No more disguises.
- I don't need you!

966
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,485
I'm crying out to you, for God's sake.

967
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,163
- (Thud)
- Is everything a negotiation here too?

968
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,742
- Stop it. Just shut up!
- Listen to me. Help me.

969
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,123
I'm tired of standing at street corners.

970
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:31,083
I want t0 love and care and need,
just like you do.

971
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:34,044
We can help each other.
We don't have to grow old...

972

- (Gasps)
- It's alright. Joanna?

973
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,181
Run away. Turn on me.

974
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,598
I was only trying to save you.

975
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,935
Well... the game's not over.

976
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:55,022
The messenger of God will return.

977

Drive on, lady.

1001

Please, it's not for me,
it's for my husband.

1002

Just the two of you.

1003
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,300
I want to buy you for an hour,
if that's what you call it.

1004
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:10,380
- Is this some kind of freak trick?
- Nothing like that, I swear.

1005
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,807
You know what it'll cost?
I'm the hottest piece of life on this street.

1006
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,931
It'll cost you 100 bucks.
Have you got 100 bucks?!

1007
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,067
I'll drive you there and bring you back.
Ten minutes on the expressway.

I just need someone to be with him.

My husband is dying.

1010
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:35,700
Maybe another three months.

1011
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:42,336
He's still functioning.
In fact, you'd hardly know he was sick.

1012
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,839
We've been married for 28 years.

1013
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:49,794
But since I found out,
I haven't been able to go near him.

1014
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:54,131
He needs me so badly.
I just can't do it.

1015
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:59,140
I want you t0 make him
feel like a man again.

His name is Ben.

01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,839
- I'm sure she told you I'm sick.
- Yes.

I didn't want her to do this.

1021
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,648
I haven't been with another woman
in 28 years.

1022
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:49,353
But she insisted.

1023
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:53,824
Yes, ma'am. She insisted.

1024

Charity really does begin at home.

1025

My God, you're lovely.

1026

What's your name?

1027
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,627
China Blue.

My body's not in the greatest shape,
as you know.

1031
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:28,149
I'll try and not make it too painful for you.

1032
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:31,069
No, don't say that.

1033
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,939

Well, your wife got you the best.
I'm the best there is.

1041

I'm gonna give you
the hottest night of your life.

I'm sorry... I'm so sorry
you have to see me like this.

Don't be sorry.

You have a lot more courage
than I have.

she asked me if I still respected her.

Hell, I thought
that's the reason we did it.

Well, it's all over.

1069
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:24,109
Go and sit down.
Do you want some coffee?

1070
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:28,823
No, I could use a shot of morphine,
if you've got it!

1071
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:33,251
I'd love to kill the last 12 years.

and I have a lot that I have to do.

01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,511
Don't judge me, Grady, huh?

1078
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:54,269
- We both live our fantasies.
- (Shouts) Only mine's over!

1079
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,441
And you're just still hanging around.

1080
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:00,528
Come on.

1081
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,698
What the hell is the point, Joanna?

1082
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,616
You work so hard
at getting these people who want you

1083
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:08,411
when it's not even you that they want!

1084
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,113
Well, I do!

1085
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:14,000
You're the one that said,
"When are you gonna grow up?"

1086
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,919
Well, I think it's about time
that we both did.

1087
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,464
It's so hard, Bobby.

1088
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:23,965
No man's ever given me that kind
of faith before, that kind of respect.

1089
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:27,464
But that hotel
is the safest place in the world.

1090
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:30,642
I can do anything there,
I can be anything I can dream of

1091
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:32,765
because it's not me.

1092
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,437
Don't you see?

1093
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,772
- I'd only end up disappointing you.
- I can chance it.

1094
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,070
I'm tough.

1095
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,193
- I'm not.
- Wait a second.

1096
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,904
Just remember one thing.

1097
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,116
We're friends.

1098
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:53,449
What we did in that hotel room
we can do here.

1099
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:58,082
We're the same people.
We've done as much as two people can.

1100
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:00,835
Only now it'll be for each other
instead of to each other.

1101
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,633
And you can't buy any higher than that.

1102
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:12,342
(Gentle music)

1103
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:31,929
O God, to whom vengeance belongs.

1104
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:36,017
How long shall the wicked triumph?

1105
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:41,356
How long shall the utterance speak
hard things?

1106
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,901
How long shall they turn 50 buck tricks

1107
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:48,776
and strut their evil bodies
in smelly silk underwear?

1108
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:53,405
Tear off that dress
and she's <i>as</i> helpless <i>as</i> I am.

1109
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:56,909
China Blue,

1110
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,745
alias Joanna Crane.

1111
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,543
Alias Peter Shayne.

1112
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:07,086
They'll all be saved.

1113
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:11,048
(Eerie music)

1114
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,286
I have to talk to you.

1115
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:38,534
What is it? Is it the kids?
What's wrong?

1116
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,286
Nothing's wrong.

1117
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:44,043
I wanna talk to you.

1118
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:46,792
About what?

1119
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:56,389
Didn't you used to have
a funny painting on that wall?

1120
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:58,808
Yeah. I took it down two years ago.

1121
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,806
Now what's up?

1122
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:09,527
I've been doing a lot of thinking,

1123
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,240
and I think I made a mistake.

1124
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:19,405
I'd like us to give it another try.

1125
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,329
Women! I give up.

1126
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,921
What do you mean, "women"?

1127
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:30,465
Who else?

1128
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,669
Amy, Why?

1129
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:39,549
You love me so much
you can't stand being apart,

1130
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,511
or you're having trouble
getting a plumber?

1131
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,849
It's hard being alone, Bobby.

1132
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,686
Me in that big bed.

1133
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:55,490
Last night I thought
I heard somebody trying to break in.

1134
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,073
I'll rig up another alarm system.

1135
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:03,490
I don't want another alarm system.

1136
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:07,494
I don't want that damn hot tub. Really...

1137
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,712
...all I want is my husband.

1138
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:20,098
And the kids really need
a mother and a father.

1139
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:22,429
For what?

1140
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:26,975
To watch them murder each other...

1141
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:30,692
...and teach them about... hate?

1142
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,022
How about teaching them responsibility?

1143
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,491
What about letting them
learn it for themselves?

1144
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:42,746
You only learn if you're taught.

1145
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:47,417
Oh yeah?
Well, we were taught everything,

1146
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,961
and we didn't learn shit!

1147
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:53,415
I happen to think
there are some values left to believe in.

1148
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:56,092
(Laughs sarcastically)
That's great, Amy!

1149
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,922
Just keep believing. I can't anymore.

1150
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:03,053
What was so wrong
with the way we lived?

1151
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:06,727
Do you know what scared me the most
during our whole marriage?

1152
01:36:06,803 --> 01:36:08,851
Do you?

1153
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,353
It's not the mortgage.

1154
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:14,026
It's not this shop.

1155
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:16,776
It was just admitting I was scared

1156
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:20,905
and letting you and the kids down.

1157
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,622
You've met somebody, haven't you?

1158
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:32,079
Of course you have.
I can smell her all over you.

1159
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:35,673
I am so dumb!

1160
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:40,257
Who is she?

1161
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:43,010
One of those swinging singles?

1162
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:45,262
Boobs out to here.

1163
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:47,469
The morals of a bitch in heat?

1164
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,975
It may come as a shock to you,

1165
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:55,102
but sex is one hell of a way
to show what you feel.

1166
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:59,230
It's no crime to enjoy it, Amy.

1167
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:02,192
It's only a crime...

1168
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,070
...when you lie about it.

1169
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:08,828
Well, I think you'd better
just get yourself out of that bed of roses

1170
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:13,332
and remember the responsibility
you have t0 your wife and your children.

1171
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:18,383
You have t0 make a very tough decision.

1172
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:24,636
I suggest you think very hard about
the things in your life that really count.

1173
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:37,603
I understand, Bobby. It's your family.
If you can't stay, you can't stay.

1174
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:41,656
I'm going t0 dinner, that's all.
It doesn't mean I'm not gonna be back.

1175
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:44,780
No matter what Amy says,
I can't go back to that life.

1176
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,907
Maybe you'd better
not come back here either.

1177
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:48,659
What's that supposed to mean?

1178
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,663
Maybe in a month or so, you'll start
feeling guilty about leaving the kids.

1179
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,666
Maybe I'll start feeling
crowded and trapped.

1180
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:59,500
Maybe you'll start resenting my past,
the time I put in on my work.

1181
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:04,088
You'll want a good meal, I can't cook.
Why don't you just go, goddamn it?!

1182
01:38:05,338 --> 01:38:08,387
You don't know what it took, Bobby.

1183
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:11,891
How long I wanted and hoped
for somebody to care for.

1184
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:14,597
- To let somebody care for me.
- I'll be back.

1185
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,900
Oh yeah, you say that. I know that.
But you're just so fucking honourable.

1186
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:23,114
Sheila told me a good one
the other day.

1187
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:28,616
She says, er,
the secretary says to the boss,

1188
01:38:28,694 --> 01:38:31,618
"So, could I use your dictaphone?"

1189
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:36,874
And he says, "No. Use your finger,
like everybody else."

1190
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,299
(Laughs)

1191
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:46,049
(Kids talking in the background)

1192
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,882
I made a new recipe tonight...

1193
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:54,016
It has all your favourite vegetables in it.
It looks pretty good.

1194
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:05,277
Oh, you know, listen, don't er...

1195
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:08,826
Don't forget it's Parents' Night
at Lisa's school next week.

1196
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,409
Well, I was gonna save this
until later, but...

1197
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,253
Here.

1198
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:22,502
Why don't you go on, open it?

1199
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:32,725
(Soft music)

1200
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,640
I found it in the garage.

1201
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:43,102
I bet you forgot that was still around.

1202
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:48,571
I washed it up and had to sew up
a couple of places on it...

1203
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:53,996
Put it on.

1204
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:04,628
Oh, I used to get
so turned on with you... in this.

1205
01:40:13,716 --> 01:40:16,094
(Music grows louder)

1206
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:40,793
(Knocking)

1207
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:44,630
Bobby?

1208
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:47,838
Last rites.

1209
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:50,170
- (Thud)
- (Glass smashing)

1210
01:40:57,343 --> 01:41:00,893
Lovely apartment.
What do you call it, Paradise Lost?

1211
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:04,897
The Reverend's
gonna save you tonight.

1212
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:08,321
Who are you? You son of a bitch!

1213
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:11,616
Don't fight me, child. I'm the messenger
of God. I only want to heal you.

1214
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:13,910
Heal thyself, pimp shit!

1215
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:16,492
(Glass smashing)

1216
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:19,996
You're opposing me, Joanna.
You have to trust me.

1217
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:24,580
One more game. The final one
that will free you forever.

1218
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:27,632
- (Sinister organ music)
- Do I have your trust?

1219
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:30,711
Because we can only play
if I have your trust.

1220
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:32,921
Do I have it?

1221
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:36,633
You are out of your fucking...

1222
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:40,437
Now listen to me. I want your trust
and I'm gonna have it any way I can.

1223
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:41,933
(Anguished cry)

1224
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:44,732
Now, you will follow
the Reverend's orders.

1225
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:46,809
Is that clear?

1226
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:51,272
- Good.
- (Blows a kiss)

1227
01:41:51,897 --> 01:41:54,400
I believe you'll find this game unique.

1228
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:58,533
It's one you've never played before and
never will again, so make the most of it.

1229
01:41:58,613 --> 01:42:01,116
It's known <i>as</i> 'exorcising the demons'.

1230
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:03,909
In my calling,
it's the ultimate salvation.

1231
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:06,462
And its ends are sacrosanct.

1232
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:11,543
With my ecclesiastic gift,
plus the grace of God,

1233
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:14,846
and a little help from... Superman here,

1234
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:20,181
I shall bestow upon you
the supreme humanitarian blessing

1235
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:22,512
and give you your freedom.

1236
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:25,644
You, er, do want that, don't you?

1237
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:30,524
I knew you would.

What's the game... Reverend?

1239
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,995
Sudden death. Now smile.

- Why?

1242
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:49,206
My mission
has always been your salvation,

1243
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,256
but you never trusted me.

1244
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:54,962
You refused to see.
But I saw.

1245
01:42:55,044 --> 01:42:57,467
I looked at you and I saw myself.

1246
01:42:57,546 --> 01:43:00,140
I saw the same escape,
the same malignancy.

1247
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:04,517
But I know the cure and I know
how desperately you need it.

1248
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,893
And only I can give it to you.

1249
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:10,021
- I want to, Joanna.
- Why?

1250
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:13,071
Because it's my gift to you.

1251
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:16,490
Freedom.
The only thing I have left to give.

1252
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:20,411
You refused it once
but this time you have no choice.

1253
01:43:20,486 --> 01:43:24,457
Getting into the part, my love?
I know I am.

1254
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:27,752
- Go fuck yourself.
- (Spits)

1255

- (Chuckles)

1256
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:33,629
Not a very nice thing
to say to a man of the cloth.

You must water them diligently.

1261
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,649
I've always preferred
plastic flowers myself.

1262
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:58,317
I could never bear
to watch the real ones die.

1263
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:01,369
But that's the trouble with living things,
I suppose.

1264
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:03,538
Inevitably they die.

1265
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,829
You've never seen anyone die,
have you?

1266
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,830
Certainly not up close.

...absolute silence.

1269
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:17,460
The stillness of the body
as the flesh turns white.

1270
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:21,548
You're terrified right now
because you think of it as death.

1271
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:24,474
But, er, think of it as...

that Amy and I

during my marriage

01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:39,744

I told Joanna.

1342
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:59,351
And she took me in her arms

1343
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:03,314
and she said,

1344
01:50:03,388 --> 01:50:06,392
"it's OK to be scared."

1345
01:50:09,686 --> 01:50:12,656
I felt... stronger.

1346
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:16,318
And freer.

1347
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:22,538
And more like a man
than I've ever felt before in my life.

1348
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:28,547
Then we fucked our brains out.
