1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,660
<i>Adam and Eve just had sex, right.</i>

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,488
<i>And God says to Adam,
"Where's Eve?"</i>

3
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,041
<i>So Adam says, "She's down
at the stream, washing off."</i>

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:37,667
<i>God says, "Damn, now I'll never get
that smell out of those fish."</i>

5
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,504
<i>You really think
that's funny, don't you?</i>

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,302
<i>I bet every man here
thinks that's funny.</i>

7
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,554
<i>Ease up, huh?
All of you. Women, Christ!</i>

8
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,135
<i>Getting to be a real pain in the ass.
You know that?</i>

9
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,346
<i>I don't know what's wrong
with the way it used be</i>

10
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,430
<i>when you just did what you were told?</i>

11
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,232
<i>Fuck you, Hopper.</i>

12
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,060
<i>I do, every night.
Me and my jar of Vaseline.</i>

13
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,147
<i>I can fuck any woman I want.
I don't even have to make her cum.</i>

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>Really? I'd rather get fucked
by</i> a <i>vibrator than your cock any day.</i>

15
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,288
<i>It's honest, loving and I don't have
to make breakfast for it in the morning.</i>

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,328
You remind me of my ex-wife.
She had an answer for everything.

17
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,879
Like whenever people
would ask her what I did.

18
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,456
She'd say, "He struggles."

19
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,133
You guys,
you all think you are the victim.

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,178
Hey, wait a minute.
I think we're taking a bum rap here.

21
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,096
I happen to be a very giving lover.

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,051
Yeah, you're giving alright.
You gave half the city the clap.

23
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,104
Alright, enough.

24
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,432
Mr Grady.
You've been awfully quiet.

25
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:43,066
I know it's your first night with the group
but is there anything you'd like to say.

26
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:49,778
No, I just came as a guest.
My buddy Hopper over here brought me.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,865
I know. But surely you must
have something to say about all this.

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,416
I mean, you are planning
to stay with us?

29
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,916
Me? Why, me, I'm happy.

30
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,882
Been married to the same woman
for 11 years.

31
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,127
Been together since high school.
We have two kids.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,680
Cut the crap. You wouldn't be
here if something wasn't bugging you.

33
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,511
I told you, I'm here with Hopper.
I have a great marriage.

34
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:20,228
I don't understand all these...
hang-ups with you people.

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,564
I've never cheated on my wife
in ten years.

36
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,271
I thought it was 11?

37
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,574
I've never met a man
yet who'd admit he was a lousy lay.

38
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,949
What's that supposed to mean?
You think everything has to do with sex?

39
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,327
Admit it. You're a lousy lay
and she's learnt to accept it.

40
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,579
- Like we all had to.
- Wait a minute!

41
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,248
- You think I'm a lousy lay?
- You got it.

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,051
I'm not the one who complains
how tired I am every night.

43
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,843
Getting her to make love...

44
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,014
It's like asking her to run
the Boston Marathon.

45
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,309
And then when we actually
go through with it,

46
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,807
I don't know whether
to embrace her or embalm her.

47
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,480
So don't tell me that I'm a lousy lay.

48
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,270
What am I saying?
What the hell am I doing here?

49
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,743
Oh, thank you, ladies and gentleman.

50
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,786
I'm grateful
from the bottom of my heart.

51
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:23,086
It is truly an honour
to be named Miss Liberty 1984.

52
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,549
I have dreamed
of this moment all my life.

53
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:32,630
And I promise I shall carry the name
with dignity and with pride.

54
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:38,936
I will always serve my country
and be a shining beacon of hope

55
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,308
to nations the world over.

56
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:48,192
Spreading the true spirit
of freedom and liberty that is America.

57
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,443
Oh, we're proud of you, Miss Liberty.

58
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,196
What do you plan to do
with your scholarship money?

59
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,997
Well. I plan to study music, sir.

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,497
Music, do you say?
What kind of instrument do you play?

61
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,499
I play the flute, sir.

62
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:09,800
In honour of our forefathers
who died at Concord and Lexington.

63
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,133
Would you like to see
how Miss Liberty plays the flute?

64
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,307
Oh, yes. Yes, very much.

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,104
First, I unzip the case.

66
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:31,440
And then I take out the instrument
very carefully. I'm very gentle.

67
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,401
And then I run my little hand all over it.

68
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:40,035
Up and down. Then up and down.

69
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:47,079
And then I fondle it so softly.
So softly.

70
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,754
I love the look of it.

71
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:59,767
Oh, I love the feel of it.
So smooth and firm.

72
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,605
I like to wrap my fingers around it
and tenderly caress it.

73
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,363
Then I like to lift it to my mouth.

74
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,705
And wrap my lips around it.

75
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:29,247
And then I just wait for that sweet,
sweet music to come pouring out.

76
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,626
Fucking incredible. Oh!

77
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,712
Fucking incredible!

78
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,638
Fucking incredible!

79
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,014
I knew it would be.

80
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,317
You knew it would be too, didn't you?
Ha-ha.

81
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,696
We know each other so well.
You know what I mean?

82
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,734
What did you say your name was?

83
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,161
China Blue.

84
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,995
No, I mean your real name.

85
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,377
Miss Liberty.

86
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,832
Well, that was some game of yours,
Miss Liberty!

87
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,509
You wanted romance.

88
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,214
My name is Carl
and I just split up with my wife.

89
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,469
It's gettin' late babe. Got to move.

90
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,056
Can I see you again?

91
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,684
I work the street. Keep an eye out.

92
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,022
It's just that it's been so long
since I got a hard-on just...

93
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,691
...looking at someone.

94
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,782
We were married 12 years.

95
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,616
She just walked out on me.
Just like that.

96
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,702
I don't know what it was I did wrong.

97
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,662
I know what you mean.

98
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,215
My ex beat it out the door
when he was tired of beating me.

99
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,917
Is that true?

100
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,505
Does it matter?

101
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,562
Yeah, well.
I'll see you around, China Blue.

102
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,266
Oh, put the cash on the dresser.

103
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,096
Hey! Shit!

104
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:37,564
"Dear God! The heathen are come
unto thine inheritance.

105
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,896
"Thy holy temple, have they defiled.

106
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,198
"They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

107
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,447
"Their blood have they shed
like water round Jerusalem."

108
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,325
- Like, like, like...
- This guy is crazy.

109
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,284
They fuck and they piss and they shit
like the fucking scum they are.

110
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:59,715
Dear God, hallowed is Thy name...
In the spirit of Lucifer.

111
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,962
Forgive me Lord. Forgive me.

112
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,969
How long, Lord,
shalt thou be angry forever?

113
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,471
Shall they jealously burn like fire?

114
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,602
Shall we keep on
fucking and pissing into this.

115
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:23,439
Forgive me, Lord.
That was... that was not me.

116
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,418
You child, victim of the night.

117
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,542
I am the Reverend Peter Shayne
and I know the plague that cripples you.

118
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:44,172
I've been sent by the Lord to save you
and to rid the earth of that plague.

119
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,127
I am His holy messenger.

120
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,468
Do you recognise me, child?

121
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,976
Sorry, I never forget a face.

122
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,524
Especially when I've sat on it.

123
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,028
- Save your soul, whore.
- Save your money, shithead.

124
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,557
I'm sorry, man. I didn't think
they'd come down on you so hard.

125
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,769
Forget it. Come on in and see the shop.
You haven't seen it for a while.

126
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,316
- Hey, Jerry!
- Good to see you, Grady.

127
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,868
How come you're still here?
I thought Mollie was sick.

128
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,945
They're coming
to pick this up tomorrow.

129
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,076
Can't afford to lose customers,
you know.

130
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,376
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll finish it up. Now, get out of here.

131
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,454
- Your wife is sick. You should be home.
- Well, thanks, Grady.

132
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,585
You know, you're the only one left
who gives a damn.

133
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,588
<i>'</i> What do
- erry!

134
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,728
Step on it.

135
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,056
What you afraid of? Step on it!

136
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,943
Got you surrounded.

137
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,023
- Still playing games?
- It'll scare the hell out of any thief.

138
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,450
<i>Do not attempt to escape.
Keep your hands up.</i>

139
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,280
Bobby, about that session.
Things must be pretty rough at home.

140
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,833
Things are great.
Just got a little wound up, that's all.

141
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,662
Like I said, still playing games.

142
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,295
You should talk. All the bodies
floating in and out of that bed.

143
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,423
That's some kind of life, pal.
Spend half of it changing sheets.

144
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,928
Sheila called me yesterday
for the first time since the divorce.

145
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,052
Still can't let her go, Bobby.

146
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,308
Well, I got a great idea.

147
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,187
Amy invited Sheila to the barbecue
on Sunday with Tommy and Patty.

148
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,940
So why don't you come?
It'll just be like old times.

149
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,920
Who's there?

150
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,825
I didn't hurt you, did I?

151
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,495
A little rougher this time
than usual.

152
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,704
Don't worry, 'sweet dick'. I'm tough.

153
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,161
"Sweet dick"?

154
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,749
Do me a favour next time.
Don't walk so fast. Hard to keep up.

155
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,922
Maybe I should rape you, huh?

156
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,379
One way to get back at your old man.

157
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,885
- Sorry?
- Your father.

158
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,262
I know he raped you
when you were a kid.

159
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,811
You told me the first time
we were at it together.

160
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,139
<i>Oh, yeah. I forgot.</i>

161
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,977
- <i>You said</i> you <i>trusted me.</i>
- <i>I do. You're the only one I told.</i>

162
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,895
It is true, isn't it?

163
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,901
- Sure it's true.
- Well, you don't seem too upset.

164
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,031
You were almost in tears
when you told me.

165
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:07,241
I'm trying to block it out of my mind.
Can't you understand?

166
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,873
I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was still a sore spot.

167
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,579
Not as sore as it was then.

168
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:23,223
Maybe, if you're real nice to me
I'll tell you all about the time

169
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,221
he tied my arms to the bed
with black twine.

170
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,644
Did he really do that?

171
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,438
He did that
to a sweet little thing like you?

172
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,391
See the scars.

173
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,228
- Where?
- Look closer.

174
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,072
Oh, yeah. I see.

175
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,989
How low can you get?

176
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,284
As low as you can afford.
And your meter's up pal.

177
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,585
That's the bitter truth.

178
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,754
Can I keep these?

179
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,877
For ten bucks.

180
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,254
Keep the trust.

181
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,343
I'm sorry I'm late honey.
I had to finish up.

182
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,302
- I ate with the kids.
- Well, I brought dessert.

183
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,230
- Thanks. You know I'm on a diet.
- Open it.

184
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,898
Da-da!

185
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,029
Have you eaten?

186
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm not hungry.
I'll fix something later.

187
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,987
Dinner's still warm.

188
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,698
Listen, I invited Donny
to the party on Sunday.

189
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,829
You know, he and Sheila
have been speaking.

190
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,082
- Or at least she called him.
- Are you crazy?

191
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,256
She only called him
'cause he was late with the alimony.

192
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,092
So how are the kids?

193
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,928
Jimmy needs braces. The dentist
says he has an overlapping bite.

194
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,428
Will they hurt?

195
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,478
I'm not concerned
whether it will hurt or not.

196
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,268
Well, if he needs braces, honey,
give him the braces.

197
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,738
- Just like that.
- Yeah, just like that.

198
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,988
So we'll go another year without
a hot tub. We can use Larson's.

199
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,947
Sure, and when we need a new car
we can just borrow the Murphys'.

200
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,533
I can borrow my sister's Cuisinart
and Sally's microwave.

201
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,086
And Kathy just got a new video recorder.
It cost 1,000 bucks.

202
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,710
She says it'll do anything she wants.

203
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,383
Well, for that price,
she should go down on him.

204
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,299
Very funny.

205
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,685
Did you talk to Jerry?

206
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,273
So where's the salt?

207
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,442
- You didn't, did you?
- Don't we have any salt?

208
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,611
- Bobby!
<i>'</i> Amy, I told you!

209
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,526
I am not letting the guy go.
I don't care how slow things are.

210
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,782
He's got a wife and kids.

211
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,364
And what do you have?

212
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,327
Maybe if you'd gone into a real business
like a normal person...

213
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,503
It's on the stove.

214
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,672
No wonder we never have any money!

215
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,093
Amy, look, I love that business.
I'm proud of it.

216
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,427
I work damn hard at it.
We'll make out OK.

217
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,853
Haven't let you down yet, have I?

218
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,728
So, who the hell needs a hot tub?
Who needs a bathtub?

219
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,988
Thinking of which,
why don't you and I...

220
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,075
...go upstairs
and take a bath together?

221
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,994
We could certainly use a bit
of adventure in our lives.

222
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,657
I'm really not in the mood
for a little adventure.

223
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,792
So what kind of lousy mood are you in?
Did you get your period today?!

224
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,840
No, I did not get my period today.

225
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,966
Every time I'm in a lousy mood,
you think I've got my period.

226
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,797
I wish.

227
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,929
By stocking Tampax I'll retire.

228
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,697
There is nothing
that means more to me...

229
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,196
...than this family.

230
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,408
Not even some stupid hot tub.

231
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,295
I have to clean up.

232
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,096
Hey! What are you guys still doing up?
Do you know what time it is?

233
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,272
Mum said we can stay up
till the next commercial.

234
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,190
No, you can't,

235
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,857
'cause you're under attack.
It's bombs away!

236
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,155
Watch out, here it comes!

237
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,586
Why don't you give your sister
time on it, cowboy?

238
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,379
Come on, you too. March, up!

239
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,332
Did you hear the joke about...?

240
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,670
Yeah, well don't worry about it,
because it's bedtime. Isn't it, Daddy?

241
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,013
- Come on. Let's go!
- Give Daddy a big hug.

242
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,567
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

243
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,355
- Hello?
- <i>Walt Pierson here.</i>

244
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,364
- Bobby Grady! How are you doin'?
- Great. You?

245
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,320
Yeah, I'm just fine, thanks.

246
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:24,705
Urn, listen. You asked me about doing
some night time surveillance for you.

247
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,082
<i>Yes. Do you think
you might still be interested?</i>

248
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:32,383
Yeah. Well, I was wondering
is the offer still good?

249
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,335
<i>You got to work nights, though.</i>

250
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,924
No problem. I could use the money.

251
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,510
<i>- I think I've got something for you.
- You do? Terrific.</i>

252
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,142
<i>- You got to work nights, though.</i>
- <i>No, no, that's</i> great.

253
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,521
- You didn't think I had the nerve!
- No, <i>I</i> didn't.

254
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,446
Neither did I.
I guess it just comes with poverty.

255
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,865
<i>Come on in and we'll talk about it.</i>

256
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,285
Yeah, well, thank you very much
and you take it easy.

257
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,239
<i>- Yeah, right. See you tomorrow.
- Fine. Bye.</i>

258
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,668
You tell them jokes and I'm the wicked
witch who sends them to bed.

259
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,412
Well, I'll put them to bed.

260
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,046
What, and keep them up
half the night with your stories?

261
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,220
It's good for the imagination.

262
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,048
Theirs or yours?

263
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,429
I'm going to be doing
some tracking for Walt Pierson,

264
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,513
so it means you can make room
for that hot tub.

265
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:32,861
You act like I've... forced you.
I don't even want it anymore.

266
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,697
Well, what do you want?
Do you know?

267
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,774
And you didn't force me.

268
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,498
Maybe I'll do the magic act at the party.

269
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,250
You know, for laughs.
What do you think?

270
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,338
Whatever you want.

271
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,757
Oh, Bobby, come on. Stop it.
We just got the cable.

272
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,347
Walt Pierson speaks very highly of you.

273
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,521
I've a lot of respect for Walt.
His word's good enough for me.

274
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,976
I'm damn good at what I do, Mr Bateman, but
I'll only take a job if I can do it right.

275
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,030
As long as you keep it quiet. I don't
want to turn this into a major event.

276
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:44,154
I've always been a pushover
for industrial espionage.

277
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,612
I'd like to help you.
Just tell me what the facts are.

278
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:53,497
I'm one of the largest manufacturers of
ladies' sportswear outside of New York,

279
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:57,045
but I'm falling behind
for the first time in 20 years.

280
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,045
Last week's orders
were at an all-time low.

281
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,799
I believe someone
in my organisation is selling patterns

282
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,550
to one of my competitors.

283
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,803
- I want you to follow her.
- Who is she?

284
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,884
The young woman's
been with me about two years.

285
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:14,063
Very talented designer.
Hell of a future, if she hasn't blown it.

286
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,267
- What makes you think it's her?
- I don't know. Gut feeling.

287
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,898
There's something about her.
I'll point her out to you.

288
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,572
Try and save some yardage
in the sleeve, OK?

289
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,399
That's her, in the grey suit.

290
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,861
How could someone
that looks like that be a criminal?

291
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,790
That's what I'm paying you to find out.

292
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,789
Follow her, where she goes at night,
what she does.

293
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,212
- Morning, Lou.
- Phil.

294
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,669
What do you mean,
"there's something about her"?

295
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,593
She's a mystery. Divorced.
Lives alone.

296
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,012
No boyfriends I know of. A real loner.

297
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,261
- What's she like in here?
- Impulsive, ambitious.

298
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,058
Never stops working,
never satisfied.

299
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,136
You know the type.
Always proving themselves.

300
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,722
- Perfection or bust.
- Any friends?

301
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,807
She gets along fine
with the other women.

302
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,770
But if you've got a penis,
you're in trouble. She turns to ice.

303
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,856
- That still doesn't make her a criminal.
- It makes her a suspect.

304
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:09,114
I don't trust anyone that works that hard.
She must be hiding something.

305
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,288
- I want you to nail her lily white ass.
- What the hell is this?

306
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:16,333
- You think she's that dangerous?
- It depends on what you discover.

307
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,761
Paradise Hotel. 4th and Main.

308
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,868
Hey, this is a fucking pain
in my ass.

309
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,883
- Do you recognise me tonight, child?
- Ha! Well, if it isn't my saviour!

310
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,555
The Reverend Peter Shayne requests
a few moments of repose upstairs,

311
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,477
in your holy of holies.

312
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,600
A reverend, no less.

313
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,528
You know, the last reverend who tried
to, er, save me... lived to regret it.

314
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,731
I chased him all around the church
until I caught him by the organ.

315
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,743
Come on.

316
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,701
I make a great Joan of Arc.
Can't you tell?

317
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:51,082
I imagine you do spend a good deal
of your time on your knees, my child.

318
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,925
Excuse us.
We've got business to conduct here.

319
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:09,267
Hi, baby! How about a shot
of the Grand Canyon, huh?

320
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,226
Holy shit!

321
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,036
Stick it there, Rev.

322
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,869
What do you want?

323
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,373
I want to help you.
Admit you need it.

324
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,329
I need it.

325
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,382
With conviction.
Make me believe.

326
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,961
Oh, please, Reverend.
You're so good and wise and strong.

327
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:40,719
Please help this sick,
disgusting degenerate.

328
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:45,052
I deal in truth. I'm bringing you
something greater than a hard-on,

329
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,638
assuming you consider truth
to be greater than a hard-on.

330
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,064
- Depends on the hard-on.
- Try it again, sinner.

331
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:05,456
First month I was married, I tried to
make my husband's favourite casserole.

332
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,328
I made a mess.

333
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,536
So I cried to my best friend Peggy
all week about it,

334
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,213
till I found out that
when I was in the kitchen making it,

335
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,711
he was in the bedroom
making Peggy.

336
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,091
Don't stare at me.

337
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,800
You're wearing your anguish
like a breakaway chastity belt.

338
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,725
You wanted the truth.

339
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,054
What else are you selling?

340
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,400
This is a fantasy business, Reverend.

341
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,570
You can have any truth you want.

342
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,899
And so can you.
Isn't that why you're here?

343
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,952
- Isn't that why you are?
- I'm here to save you.

344
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,247
Why don't you fuck me?
That'll save me.

345
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,245
Not from your disease.

346
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,669
What disease?
I'm healthy as a horse.

347
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,873
I'm fit as a fiddle and ready for cock.

348
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:59,551
Whores and metaphors don't mix.
Who are you?

349
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,596
I'm Cinderella, Cleopatra,

350
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,551
Goldie Hawn, Eva Braun.
I'm Little Miss Muffin, Pocahontas.

351
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,635
I'm whoever you want me to be,
Reverend.

352
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,016
But what are you doing here?

353
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,145
- Satisfying.
- Who?

354
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:18,070
- I think the confessional is about over.
- Don't you want to be saved?

355
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,193
- Do you get that much out of this?
- I get paid.

356
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,276
I'm not interested in what you're selling,
only what you're buying.

357
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,157
Why don't you assume
the missionary position, Reverend?

358
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,364
My purpose here is totally humanitarian.

359
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:32,702
- To make me see the light?
- To make you see through the bullshit.

360
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,879
<i>You want truth, Father?
I give the best truth in town.</i>

361
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,298
<i>So good, you wouldn't
know it from make believe.</i>

362
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,627
<i>- Is it?
- If you believe it is.</i>

363
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,806
Everybody needs something
to believe in, don't they, Reverend?

364
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:49,226
Bow down, 0 Lord, and hear me
for I am poor and needy.

365
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,804
Preserve my soul, for I am holy.

366
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:55,767
O Thou, my God.
Save thy servant, that trusteth in Thee.

367
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:00,980
Save him from this bigmouth cooze
with a motor driven ass.

368
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:05,363
Forgive me, Lord. I speak not in vain
but this little bitch provokes me so.

369
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:09,367
Oh, Jesus!
At least I can stay in character.

370
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:13,872
You couldn't even get a walk-on, unless
it was you that was being walked on.

371
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,044
I am a messenger of God,
you little cocksucker!

372
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,121
What's this, your mail bag?
Let's see what's in it

373
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,252
No!

374
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,709
- What is this, top secret?
- No.

375
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,589
Let Mama have a little peak.

376
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,171
What have you got in here,
the Holy Grail?

377
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,511
Oh, my God! Oh, excuse me, oh God!

378
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:35,143
Need I remind you, Jezebel,
that curiosity killed the cat.

379
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,725
Not until it got out of the bag.

380
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,811
These are the Devil's playthings.
Those who touch them will burn.

381
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,818
Put another log on the fire, Reverend.
Let's see a sample.

382
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,618
- It's a disgusting array.
- Disgusting's my middle name, honey.

383
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,071
- What have you got in the bag?
- God, forgive me.

384
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,997
A tit pacifier.

385
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,205
That milk of human kindness,
remedial, even in simulation.

386
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:06,132
A foam rubber pretty kitty, already house
broken. You can teach it new tricks.

387
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,260
It comes with a battery pack.
It's in here somewhere.

388
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,426
An auto-suck.

389
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:16,309
Modern technology at its most
compassionate, and it swallows.

390
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,358
This one is a little on the blink.

391
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:24,654
Oh, are you hungry? How about
a beat-me-eat-me liquorice whip?

392
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,608
The taste that leaves its mark forever.

393
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:31,946
Hey, no. Wait a minute.
I'm not through here. What else you got?

394
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,740
What?

395
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,959
What the hell?

396
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,174
Is this a cruise missile or a Pershing?

397
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,479
What are you gonna do?
Fuck someone to death?

398
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,855
You'd like to, wouldn't you?

399
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,153
Only the right woman.

400
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,985
I've got to go.

401
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,158
Just when we're making progress.

402
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,157
I can only handle
one revelation a night.

403
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:17,036
Enough of them
and you might be able to handle real life.

404
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,709
Real life, Reverend?

405
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,004
Tell me your name,
or is that a tough one?

406
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,084
China Blue.

407
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:31,718
I like it. It's rather exotic,
like something out of Charlie Chan.

408
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,049
B-movies have always
been my inspiration.

409
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,305
<i>What's yours'?
Going My Way?</i>

410
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,232
All you need to know about me
is that I intend to save you.

411
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,977
And all you need to do is... be there.

412
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,900
Stay with me, China Blue.
Trust me. I'll free you.

413
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,367
Who are you?
You're not a Reverend. Who are you?

414
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,121
<i>I'm you.</i>

415
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,295
<i>I will sing of mercy and judgment.</i>

416
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,873
<i>Unto thee, o Lord, will I sing.</i>

417
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,176
<i>I will behave myself wisely
in a perfect way.</i>

418
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,253
<i>I will walk within my house
with a perfect heart</i>

419
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,840
<i>and I will set no wicked thing
before mine eyes.</i>

420
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:24,603
<i>Not even the stupid douchebag
who's luring me into her rotten spell.</i>

421
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,930
<i>The snatch can't fool me, Lord.</i>

422
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,937
<i>I'm not like the others.
I know her cowardly game.</i>

423
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:34,146
<i>A fear of men so great, she can
only feel strength behind her facade.</i>

424
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,408
"Who so slandereth his neighbour,
will I cut off."

425
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,367
I'll cut off, alright.

426
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,167
I'll cut off... her little tits.

427
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,726
Why didn't you come to me, Phil?
I would have loaned you the money.

428
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,654
- Hell, I would have given you the money.
- Goddamn pride.

429
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,573
What about jail? No pride in there.

430
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,778
Who thinks? Cooper offered me
a fortune for the patterns.

431
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,205
I lost control!

432
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,539
Please, Lou.
I'll work for nothing.

433
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,879
Anything you want.

434
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,924
What this would do
to Sarah and my boy...

435
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,879
I'll have to think about it, Phil.

436
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:41,239
I had to have someone around here
to talk to about this whole damn thing.

437
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,739
The man's been with me 18 years.
I trusted him.

438
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:50,373
He was so moved that I did
that he broke down and confessed.

439
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,122
That's gratitude for you.

440
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,795
I didn't know my trust meant that much.

441
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,752
What do I do now?

442
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,431
- Give him another chance.
- The man is a criminal.

443
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,634
Come on. You heard his motive.

444
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,390
The guy's only human.
He knows he was wrong.

445
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,565
God knows we've all made mistakes.
Why ruin his life over one mistake?

446
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,814
- What about the law?
- Screw the law.

447
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,445
What good is he in jail?

448
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,149
Beside, he'll work twice
as hard for you here.

449
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,576
And you can feel like the king of hearts.

450
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,535
I don't know
what's right or wrong anymore.

451
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,336
- Did you really believe it was her?
- So I'm a lousy guesser.

452
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,334
What did you get on her?

453
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,626
Not much. She stayed home all night.

454
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:49,224
- Is that you, Joe?
- Are you <i>free?</i>

455
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:54,430
No, but I'm one hell of a bargain.

456
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:59,109
I meant, are you available.
You know... for action.

457
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:04,485
Action? Soldier, for 50 bucks,
you can name your own battlefield.

458
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:18,336
I'm sorry! I'm not too good at this.
It's my first time.

459
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,631
Oh? Are you that desperate
or that horny?

460
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,877
- I'm married.
- Oh, that desperate and that horny.

461
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:31,095
Go slow! I'm just... a boy scout.

462
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:36,772
Well, baby,
you are about to become an explorer.

463
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,065
Oh, hot body!

464
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,654
- Are you an athlete?
- Yeah.

465
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,946
Played varsity football, high school.

466
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,000
- Quarterback.
- Mm.

467
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:02,001
Well, Quarterback,
you can have the ride of your life,

468
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,832
if you trust me at the wheel.

469
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,259
Sit down.

470
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,721
How, er, good a driver are you?

471
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,555
Who said anything about driving?
Driving's what you do with your wife.

472
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,981
Here, we fly.

473
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,899
Sound good, lover?

474
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,443
Bet you and your wife
haven't done much flying, right?

475
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,864
Shit, me and my wife haven't
been doing much driving lately.

476
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,409
<i>I'm ready for take-off.</i>

477
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,658
You're on standby, babe.
I got a full load.

478
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,741
<i>OK, but next week it's first class.</i>

479
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,254
Who are you?

480
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,924
It's not a prom date, sweetie.
I'm a hooker, you're a trick.

481
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,221
Why ruin a perfect relationship?

482
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,433
Here, have a Quaalude.

483
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:03,938
To float. You'll love it, I promise.
Flyer never lies.

484
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,542
Fasten your seatbelt, honey,

485
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,745
and say hello to freedom.

486
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,355
Good evening.
Welcome to China Blue Airlines flight 69,

487
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,432
non-stop service to paradise.

488
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,689
We'll be taking off shortly.
I'll be unbuckling your belt

489
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:54,241
and seeing that big bird rise and rise,

490
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:59,619
finally settling into the comfort
only this wide body can provide.

491
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,793
We're here to serve you.

492
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:09,082
Please remember that although
we may run out of Panam coffee,

493
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:14,171
we'll never run out of TWA tea.

494
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,306
<i>Hey, Ivory soap.</i>

495
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:16,355
<i>99 and 44/100% pure.
Kind of funny, isn't it?</i>

496
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:29,364
<i>- That guy...
- Don't say it.</i>

497
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,445
<i>You don't even know
what I was going to say.</i>

498
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,156
Do you?

499
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,287
- Why are you <i>in</i> a hurry?
- Me?

500
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,745
<i>You raced for that shower
like it was the Indy 500.</i>

501
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,046
<i>You couldn't wait to wash it off,
could you?</i>

502
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,964
- <i>Now wait</i> a <i>minute...</i>
<i>- No problem.</i>

503
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,419
<i>Hey, I know the boy scout oath.
"Cleanliness is next to godliness."</i>

504
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,129
<i>How the hell would you know?</i>

505
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,714
<i>You haven't been
next to one in years.</i>

506
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,733
<i>What I do in this room
might not win me a Purple Heart</i>

507
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,976
<i>but it sure as shit
beats the PTA meeting.</i>

508
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,312
Why are we acting like this?

509
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,187
I thought fucking was supposed
to bring people closer together,

510
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:04,396
- not drive them apart.
- Is that what it did for your marriage?

511
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,075
What we did tonight...

512
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:15,657
You felt it too, didn't you?
You weren't just acting.

513
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,242
You felt what I did.

514
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,629
Tell me, please. I have to know.

515
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,800
Would you, um...?

516
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,592
Would you maybe
like to see me again?

517
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,550
Yes.

518
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,934
But I can't.

519
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,147
Well, you know there are three things

520
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,371
you have to know to be able
to make it as 50 buck hooker.

521
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:49,490
You have to act, fuck
and know how to count to 50.

522
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,659
You're lucky, you've seen all three.

523
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,409
<i>Close the door on your way out.
There are a lot of creeps around here.</i>

524
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,681
Ready when you are, CB.

525
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,399
Not tonight, OK.

526
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,823
Freedom requires treatment.

527
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,655
Just leave me alone.

528
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,736
I would if I thought you wanted me to.

529
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,412
Get out.

530
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,331
Women, you mystify me.

531
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,661
The extremes you go to for a little
validation, but you still go home alone.

532
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,799
What's your mystery, Reverend?

533
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,968
Authority never reveals itself.

534
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,045
Huh. Why?

535
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:58,134
Are you afraid I'll stop believing,
or afraid you will?

536
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,812
Those are the rules.
My 50, my game, my rules.

537
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,560
Game's over, fraud.

538
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,613
The game's never over.

539
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,816
That's what you're here for, isn't it?

540
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:16,528
- I don't feel like playing games.
- I think you do.

541
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,783
Consider the alternative.

542
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:24,619
You want a game? Go sit down!

543
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:29,840
♪ Onward, Christian soldiers!

544
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,089
♪ Marching as to war

545
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,546
♪ With the cross of Jesus... ♪

546
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,256
Stop it!

547
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,388
♪ Going on before ♪

548
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,220
Come on, stud!

549
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,397
Give it to me. It's all a game.

550
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,941
Fly! Do what you want!
You want freedom?

551
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,018
You need to manipulate
women to feel like a man?

552
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,729
Do it! That's what we're here for.

553
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,814
Like you manipulate men
to feel like a woman?

554
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,899
- Let go, damn you.
- Why, it's only a game.

555
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,826
- Let go, I said.
- It hurts, doesn't it?

556
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,949
- Let go, you fuck!
- Tell me it hurts.

557
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,496
Yes, it hurts!

558
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,995
You see, you can feel.

559
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,555
I'm sorry...

560
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,185
How was it, huh? Not bad?

561
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,066
PhD in emotionalism, huh?

562
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:36,775
I have accepted reality.
I'm cured.

563
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,700
Free at last!

564
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,153
Shit!

565
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:43,034
You self-righteous son of a bitch!

566
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,582
I can play your goddamn game
as well as you can

567
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,456
and I don't use religion
to pump myself up.

568
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:52,256
If you're a minister, I'm Snow White.

569
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:56,086
Yes, but, what fun
it is playing the part.

570
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:59,342
- Would you leave now, please?
- That was quite a performance.

571
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,515
There's no limit to my talents.

572
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,093
You're the head of your class,
or is it the...

573
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:07,521
- ...class of your head?
- Oh, a man of words.

574
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,850
He makes up in diction
what he lacks in click.

575
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,778
Lesson for today.

576
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,481
I've written you a poem.
Would you like to hear it?

577
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,658
<i>Behold this wicked woman</i>

578
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:24,079
<i>She falls, she mends,
she crawls, she bends</i>

579
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,249
<i>She sucks it, fucks it,
picks it up and licks it</i>

580
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,294
<i>You can whip her, beat her,
maul her, mistreat her</i>

581
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,043
<i>Anything you want
as long as you don't touch her</i>

582
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,546
Get out of here. Take your
goddamn truth and get out of here!

583
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,627
Show her affection, she turns to stone.

584
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,587
You haven't had
your 50 dollars worth yet!

585
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,424
- Come back her, listen to me!
- Get away from me!

586
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:48,103
- Urgh! You...!
- Do you know what you are?

587
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,854
A cheap painted slut
who makes a fortune selling illusions.

588
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,731
Ah!

589
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,647
One of your regulars, my dear?

590
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,606
Rather eager tonight, isn't he?

591
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:08,700
I guess I taught that guy a lesson.

592
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,662
That was no guy.
That was my saviour.

593
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,257
I've never been fought over before.
Only been fought.

594
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,757
Yeah, well, it's tough work.
You can't please everyone.

595
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:24,511
Oh, I didn't mean this work.
In this work, I can please everyone.

596
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,969
Come on. What are you still doing
hanging around here anyway?

597
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,850
It's OK. I'm not helpless.

598
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,310
I guess I could use some help.

599
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:44,489
Thanks for the help just then.
Or the attempt anyway.

600
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,741
Yeah, we're not all out to get you.

601
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,078
Now go on home to your wife.

602
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,798
I wish I could tell her,

603
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,422
the way you made me feel.

604
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,171
She'll say it's part of my imagination.

605
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,890
It was.

606
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,486
- The kids hate this salad.
- Where are they?

607
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,238
They're at my mom's.

608
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:28,787
Guess who we just saw.
Janey Durant.

609
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,866
Remember, Amy? She beat you out
for head cheerleader.

610
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:35,294
- What a slut.
- She's not a slut.

611
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,167
She went to Ohio State.

612
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,089
Every two years they let a slut
into Ohio State.

613
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,543
Her timing was good.

614
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,506
I sat next to her in Biology.
She was always dropping her frog.

615
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:51,344
- What's she doing now?
- She's a waitress at Seafood Heaven.

616
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,225
- Didn't she marry Lenny Harris?
- That nerd?

617
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,648
He sat behind me in English
and tied mirrors to his shoes

618
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,646
so he could look up my dress.

619
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,978
Shit! What are you talking about?
That was me!

620
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,859
I knew it was some nerd.

621
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,865
It's OK. I've got one.

622
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,194
- Isn't it flat?
- I like it flat.

623
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,278
You never liked it flat
when we were married.

624
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,456
I never liked anything
when we were married.

625
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,330
OK, team. Get it while it's hot.

626
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:18,379
He thinks he's still in high school.

627
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,169
Alright!

628
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,127
You've got mustard all over!

629
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,095
OK, everybody.
Look at me and smile.

630
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,014
One or the other. We can't do both.

631
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,688
One more for posterity.

632
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,719
200 for a three-way.

633
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,472
- You got a radio?
- We've got whatever you want.

634
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,428
Health insurance?

635
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,824
Want to get to heaven early?

636
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,853
Maybe we should make him
an offer at 14.

637
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:01,102
He's got so much stock already,
he might cooperate.

638
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,434
We can't go lower than 18.
It's an insult.

639
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:07,238
I refuse to pay that opportunistic
bastard more than he deserves.

640
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,735
It's a matter of principle.

641
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:15,120
I'm still worried
about Fenley coming through, though.

642
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,825
The man has absolutely no sense
of morality. Don't you agree, dear?

643
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,875
<i>Mmhm.</i>

644
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:27,045
I'd like to finalise this
before Laurie comes home for vacation.

645
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:30,549
Hope she isn't bringing that boy
she's seeing. You know, the Jew.

646
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,470
Not that I'm a bigot or anything.

647
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,799
You know the work
I've done for crippled children.

648
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,304
If he's Jewish,
what are we gonna do with him?

649
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,557
God knows we can't take him
to the country club.

650
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,685
Claudia, have you ever heard
of a Jew who didn't play golf?

651
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,870
Arthur, don't stick your tongue in her ear.

652
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,164
You have to be careful
with these people.

653
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,334
You don't know what kind of germs
they could be carrying.

654
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,958
Stop this crate!

655
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:52,172
Close the deal quick
before your tongue drops off.

656
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,430
Promise me
you won't do the magic act.

657
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,562
- What? You told me you liked it.
- I lied.

658
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,736
Donny... Donny!

659
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:15,566
I think it's time for the old HP.
A little nostalgia for the gang.

660
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:18,072
You rat porker!

661
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:22,497
- Does Amy know?
- I thought I'd surprise her.

662
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:27,453
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention
please. We have a treat in store.

663
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,333
That dumb magic act.

664
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,005
It's no magic act.

665
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:35,757
Live on our stage,
direct from the wild jungles of Borneo...

666
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,714
Ah, damn! It's the old ace pick.

667
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,595
Skill and daring,

668
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,722
ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves,

669
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:46,522
you're about to experience...
the human penis.

670
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,727
Bobby, don't. I mean it!

671
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,608
Bravo, bravo!

672
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,415
Did your mother teach you
to wash your hands

673
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,671
after you go to the bathroom?

674
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,970
She taught me not to piss on my fingers.

675
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,806
- Did it feel good to get even?
- Did it feel good to lie?

676
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,060
I thought you liked the magic act.

677
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:14,018
I just didn't want to hurt your feelings.

678
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,102
I guess you can't win.

679
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,984
You can win by being honest with me
instead of humouring me.

680
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,533
What do we have
if we can't be honest with each other?

681
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,115
I don't know, Bobby. What do we have?

682
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,121
I don't know, Amy.

683
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,253
What else have you
been humouring me about?

684
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,625
Go to sleep.

685
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,503
No, I want to know what else
you've been sparing me from.

686
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,756
I'm really not in the mood for this.

687
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,714
Are you ever in the mood for anything?

688
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:47,597
Don't turn away from me.
I want to know what's bugging you.

689
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,518
Is it the way I eat?

690
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,599
Why did you pour
all that maple syrup on my pancakes?

691
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,309
It was a mistake, alright?

692
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,771
- Was it?
- What do you think?

693
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,777
I'm trying to poison you
with maple syrup?

694
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,198
If you're unhappy about something,
just tell me.

695
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,278
Don't take it out on me.

696
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,907
I'm really tired.

697
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,618
No, damn it! Stop avoiding this.

698
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,500
You've been acting like
I have the plague or something.

699
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,461
I want to know
what the hell is bothering you.

700
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,594
Is it money again?

701
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:30,310
Nuclear war?

702
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:37,060
What about the way we make love,
if you can remember back that far?

703
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,816
All your ooh-ing and ah-ing.

704
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,023
Is that so you just
don't hurt my feelings?

705
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,451
- Stop!
- Come on, I want to know. Tell me.

706
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:49,871
- Bobby, don't do this.
- Tell me, damn it!

707
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,995
Be honest for once. I can take it.

708
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,874
Have you been getting off too?

709
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:01,083
- You've just been humouring me.
- I really hate this kind of talk.

710
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:07,715
It's not the HP
and it's not the magic act.

711
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:11,685
It's just us.

712
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,100
I want the truth.

713
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,331
You wanted the truth.

714
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,454
I'm sorry.

715
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,128
You're sorry.

716
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:42,128
What do you want me to say?

717
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:54,265
Why couldn't you just tell me this before?

718
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,228
All this time
it hasn't been good for you.

719
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,107
Why did you have to lie about it?

720
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:13,914
I am your husband. Don't you think
I would care about something like that?

721
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,871
That I'd want to do something about it?

722
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:23,172
Didn't you trust me enough
to believe that?

723
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,520
I didn't say it wasn't good for me.

724
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:49,153
I just don't need the same thing
from it that you do.

725
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:53,320
It's never been important to me.

726
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,911
And you know
I feel funny talking about it.

727
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,371
Do you feel better faking it?

728
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,295
You were satisfied.

729
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,218
Satisfied?!

730
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,850
What do you think I am?
Some kind of machine?

731
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,474
That I just need a hole to cum in?

732
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:23,976
I mean, what do you think
makes me cum?

733
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,605
- Stop!
- No.

734
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:29,610
- What do you think makes me cum?
- I don't care!

735
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:37,786
I'll tell you. I thought it was
being inside the woman that I love.

736
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,416
And giving her as much pleasure
as she was giving to me.

737
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:48,000
You know, the two of us, together.

738
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:03,515
Some kind of magician I turned out to be.

739
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,020
So good, I conned myself.

740
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,528
Maybe it's time
we both stopped the conning.

741
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,957
Started learning again.

742
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,413
On our own.

743
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:37,591
I know you're pissed, but before
you go crazy, just let me explain.

744
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:40,769
You followed me!
I don't fucking believe this.

745
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,892
I just want to talk to you.
I don't to make any trouble. I promise.

746
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:47,271
- I have to go to work.
- It won't take long. Please.

747
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,770
Thank you.

748
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,868
- Well?
- It's a great apartment.

749
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,198
What are you, a real estate agent?

750
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,827
I saw these in a book once.

751
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:10,799
They say that in the East,
it's forbidden to have sex with someone

752
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,968
who knows your secrets,
or shortcomings.

753
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,671
You'd never be horny there.

754
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,756
I'm never horny here.

755
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,097
I guess not.

756
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,052
Cut the crap.

757
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,809
What do you want from me?

758
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,311
What makes you think
I want something?

759
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,814
Everybody wants something.

760
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,066
Why did you come here?

761
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,111
I wanted to see you again.

762
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:42,456
Look, if you think you're gonna
get back in my panties forget it.

763
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,124
There's one asshole
in there already.

764
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,372
Maybe I just want to know you.

765
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:50,171
I mean, I've never met anyone like you.

766
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,214
Who has?

767
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:56,136
I just thought after last week
maybe we could be friends.

768
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,588
You really think we could be friends
after last week?

769
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,925
Yeah, I can't think of a better way
to start a friendship.

770
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,969
We haven't met. I'm Bobby Grady.

771
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,521
Joanna Crane, I saw it on the mailbox.

772
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:11,067
What are you, about 30?
Still call yourself Bobby?

773
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:14,646
- I'll grow up when I'm ready.
- Oh, I think you're ready.

774
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,406
Are you alone?

775
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,950
Aren't we all?

776
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:24,121
You remind me of this hamster I had
when I was a kid.

777
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,746
- I remind you of a hamster?
- Yep.

778
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,044
He ran away
whenever you tried to touch him.

779
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,622
So I wanted to show him
there's nothing to be afraid of.

780
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:35,254
So one day, I just picked him
real fast and I held him.

781
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:39,634
- And he turned tender and loving?
- No, he shit in my hand.

782
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:46,352
Well, I'd better get going
'cause you're gonna be late for work.

783
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:50,182
It's OK. I'm used to breaking rules.
I'm a criminal at heart.

784
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,517
You meant you had one.

785
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:58,653
Thanks a lot, and I'm sorry
for busting in on you like this.

786
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,530
I really appreciate you listening
and I won't bother you again.

787
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,407
Oh, Bobby, if you, um...

788
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:08,370
If you ever really need me...

789
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,827
- ...to talk or whatever, I'm here.
- I know.

790
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,039
Joanna Crane.

791
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,300
Hello?

792
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,221
Hey, cowboy.

793
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,394
- Hi.
- Hi.

794
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,391
Dad, Morn said you've moved out.

795
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:39,235
Well, your mom and I,
we have to be on our own for a while.

796
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:44,069
I swear, that doesn't mean we've
stopped caring about you and Lisa.

797
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:50,500
Dad, if Mom gets married again, I don't
have to call the other guy Dad, do I?

798
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:58,376
Oh, Jimmy. No matter what happens,
I'm always gonna be your dad.

799
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,804
Why do you have to go?

800
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,513
Promise you won't be
any trouble to your mother.

801
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:10,186
- You watch out for your sister.
- Jimmy, come on!

802
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:13,185
- I will, don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

803
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,578
Hello, Joanna.

804
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,291
What are you doing here?
You have no right to be here.

805
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,465
I had to.

806
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,251
For both of us.

807
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:24,961
Get away from me.

808
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,388
I don't even want to know you.

809
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,511
No more deceptions, Joanna.

810
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,935
I know who you are.
We're the same, don't you see?

811
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,308
The same rage, the same fear.

812
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,857
We hurt the same,
we escape the same.

813
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:42,563
But we don't have to any more.
We have a chance. Both of us, together.

814
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:47,283
- No more disguises.
- I don't need you!

815
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,360
I'm crying out to you, for God's sake.

816
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:52,037
Is everything a negotiation here too?

817
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:55,617
- Stop it. Just shut up!
- Listen to me. Help me.

818
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,998
I'm tired of standing at street corners.

819
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,957
I want to love and care and need,
just like you do.

820
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,918
We can help each other.
We don't have to grow old...

821
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:08,847
It's alright. Joanna?

822
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,055
Run away. Turn on me.

823
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,472
I was only trying to save you.

824
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:21,810
Well... the game's not over.

825
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:25,897
The messenger of God will return.

826
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:31,240
And this time...
he'll bring the final word.

827
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:58,572
There's Ivory soap in the shower.
It's... 99 and 44/100% pure.

828
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,198
Isn't that funny?

829
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,030
Yeah?

830
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:29,743
I don't know how to do this sort of thing.
I've been driving around for an hour.

831
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:30,917
Drive on, lady.

832
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,995
Please, it's not for me,
it's for my husband.

833
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,751
Just the two of you.

834
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,174
I want to buy you for an hour,
if that's what you call it.

835
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:41,254
- Is this some kind of freak trick?
- Nothing like that, I swear.

836
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,682
You know what it'll cost? I'm the
hottest piece of life on this street.

837
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,806
It'll cost you 100 bucks.
Have you got 100 bucks?!

838
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,941
I'll drive you there and bring you back.
Ten minutes on the expressway.

839
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,565
I just need someone to be with him.

840
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,532
My husband is dying.

841
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,574
Maybe another three months.

842
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:13,210
He's still functioning.
In fact, you'd hardly know he was sick.

843
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,714
We've been married for 28 years.

844
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:20,669
But since I found out,
I haven't been able to go near him.

845
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:25,006
He needs me so badly.
I just can't do it.

846
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:30,014
I want you to make him
feel like a man again.

847
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,329
His name is Ben.

848
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:02,380
My wife takes her guilt very seriously.

849
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,713
- I'm sure she told you I'm sick.
- Yes.

850
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,931
I didn't want her to do this.

851
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:15,523
I haven't been with another woman
in 28 years.

852
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,228
But she insisted.

853
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:24,698
Yes, ma'am. She insisted.

854
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:36,418
Charity really does begin at home.

855
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:39,459
My God, you're lovely.

856
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,800
What's your name?

857
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,502
China Blue.

858
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:47,213
I see. Image and all, eh?

859
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,259
Well... China Blue.

860
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:55,646
My body's not in the greatest shape,
as you know.

861
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,024
I'll try and not make
it too painful for you.

862
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,943
No, don't say that.

863
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,813
I want to make it good for you.

864
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:20,750
Oh, I want you so.

865
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,832
You're my master, my king.

866
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,212
Please let me have it. I wanna feel
that big strong man inside me.

867
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:31,139
- Please, I want you so bad.
- Don't.

868
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,559
Alright.

869
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:39,648
Well, your wife got you the best.
I'm the best there is.

870
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,602
I'm gonna give you
the hottest night of your life.

871
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,988
Do you think you can raise the dead?

872
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,031
Oh no, Ben, don't.

873
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:57,286
Don't be afraid.

874
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,744
It was only a game.

875
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:05,799
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry
you have to see me like this.

876
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,922
Don't be sorry.

877
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,675
You have a lot more courage
than I have.

878
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:14,220
At least you've stopped pretending.

879
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:20,397
Well, so long, China Blue.

880
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,778
Joanna.

881
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:29,865
Joanna.

882
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,192
<i>- Yeah'?
- It's Bobby.</i>

883
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:10,815
Look, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

884
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:14,527
Remember when you said,
"if you need me, I'm here."

885
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,161
Well, I need you.

886
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:21,120
Come on in.

887
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,630
God, I don't believe
that you're still working.

888
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,707
When do you sleep?

889
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,383
Valentine's Day.

890
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:34,217
- Is it your wife?
- Is it my wife?

891
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,889
The first time Amy and I made love,

892
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:44,269
she asked me if I still respected her.

893
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,567
Hell, I thought
that's the reason we did it.

894
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:50,729
Well, it's all over.

895
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,984
Go and sit down.
Do you want some coffee?

896
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:59,698
No, I could use a shot of morphine,
if you've got it!

897
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:04,125
I'd love to kill the last 12 years.

898
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,163
You'll survive.

899
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,714
I'm a goddamn fool.

900
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,918
Why did I believe so hard?

901
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:15,212
Now what do I have to believe in?

902
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:19,345
Bobby, come on. it really is late
and I have a lot that I have to do.

903
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,386
Don't judge me, Grady, huh?

904
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:25,143
- We both live our fantasies.
- Only mine's over!

905
01:26:25,222 --> 01:26:27,316
And you're just still hanging around.

906
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,403
Come on.

907
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:33,572
What the hell is the point, Joanna?

908
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:36,491
You work so hard
at getting these people who want you

909
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,285
when it's not even you that they want!

910
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:40,988
Well, I do!

911
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:44,874
You're the one that said,
"When are you gonna grow up?"

912
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,794
Well, I think it's about time
that we both did.

913
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,338
It's so hard, Bobby.

914
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:54,840
No man's ever given me that kind
of faith before, that kind of respect.

915
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:58,339
But that hotel
is the safest place in the world.

916
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:01,517
I can do anything there,
I can be anything I can dream of

917
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,639
because it's not me.

918
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,312
Don't you see?

919
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:10,647
- I'd only end up disappointing you.
- I can chance it.

920
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:12,945
I'm tough.

921
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:15,067
- I'm not.
- Wait a second.

922
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,779
Just remember one thing.

923
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,990
We're friends.

924
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:24,323
What we did in that hotel room
we can do here.

925
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:28,957
We're the same people.
We've done as much as two people can.

926
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:31,709
Only now it'll be for each other
instead of to each other.

927
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:34,507
And you can't buy any higher than that.

928
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:02,804
O God, to whom vengeance belongs.

929
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,891
How long shall the wicked triumph?

930
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:12,231
How long shall the utterance speak
hard things?

931
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:15,775
How long shall they turn 50 buck tricks

932
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:19,651
and strut their evil bodies
in smelly silk underwear?

933
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:24,280
Tear off that dress
and she's <i>as</i> helpless <i>as</i> I am.

934
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:27,784
China Blue,

935
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,620
alias Joanna Crane.

936
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,418
Alias Peter Shayne.

937
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:37,961
They'll all be saved.

938
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,160
I have to talk to you.

939
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,408
What is it? Is it the kids?
What's wrong?

940
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,160
Nothing's wrong.

941
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:14,917
I wanna talk to you.

942
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,666
About what?

943
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:27,389
Didn't you used to have
a funny painting on that wall?

944
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:29,808
Yeah. I took it down two years ago.

945
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:31,806
Now what's up?

946
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,527
I've been doing a lot of thinking,

947
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:45,240
and I think I made a mistake.

948
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:50,404
I'd like us to give it another try.

949
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:54,328
Women! I give up.

950
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:59,921
What do you mean, "women"?

951
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:01,464
Who else?

952
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:05,669
Amy, Why?

953
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:10,549
You love me so much
you can't stand being apart,

954
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:13,511
or you're having trouble
getting a plumber?

955
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:17,848
It's hard being alone, Bobby.

956
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:21,685
Me in that big bed.

957
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:26,489
Last night I thought
I heard somebody trying to break in.

958
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:30,073
I'll rig up another alarm system.

959
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:34,490
I don't want another alarm system.

960
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,494
I don't want that damn hot tub. Really...

961
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,711
...all I want is my husband.

962
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:48,880
I understand, Bobby. It's your family.
If you can't stay, you can't stay.

963
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:52,933
I'm going to dinner, that's all.
It doesn't mean I'm not gonna be back.

964
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:56,057
No matter what Amy says,
I can't go back to that life.

965
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,184
Maybe you'd better
not come back here either.

966
01:31:58,263 --> 01:31:59,936
What's that supposed to mean?

967
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:03,940
Maybe in a month or so, you'll start
feeling guilty about leaving the kids.

968
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:06,943
Maybe I'll start feeling
crowded and trapped.

969
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:10,777
Maybe you'll start resenting my past,
the time I put in on my work.

970
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:15,365
You'll want a good meal, I can't cook.
Why don't you just go, goddamn it?!

971
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:19,663
You don't know what it took, Bobby.

972
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:23,168
How long I wanted and hoped
for somebody to care for.

973
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:25,874
- To let somebody care for me.
- I'll be back.

974
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:29,177
Oh yeah, you say that. I know that.
But you're just so fucking honourable.

975
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:34,307
Sheila told me a good one
the other day.

976
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:39,809
She says, er,
the secretary says to the boss,

977
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:42,812
"So, could I use your dictaphone?"

978
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:48,068
And he says, "No. Use your finger,
like everybody else."

979
01:32:57,322 --> 01:33:00,075
I made a new recipe tonight...

980
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:05,209
It has all your favourite vegetables in it.
It looks pretty good.

981
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:16,470
Oh, you know, listen, don't er...

982
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:20,019
Don't forget it's Parents' Night
at Lisa's school next week.

983
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,602
Well, I was gonna save this
until later, but...

984
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:30,446
Here.

985
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:33,696
Why don't you go on, open it?

986
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,834
I found it in the garage.

987
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,296
I bet you forgot that was still around.

988
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:59,764
I washed it up and had to sew up
a couple of places on it...

989
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,189
Put it on.

990
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:15,822
Oh, I used to get
so turned on with you... in this.

991
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,823
Bobby?

992
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,031
Last rites.

993
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:12,086
Lovely apartment.
What do you call it, Paradise Lost?

994
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:16,090
The Reverend's
gonna save you tonight.

995
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:19,514
Who are you? You son of a bitch!

996
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:22,809
Don't fight me, child. I'm the messenger
of God. I only want to heal you.

997
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:25,103
Heal thyself, pimp shit!

998
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:31,189
You're opposing me, Joanna.
You have to trust me.

999
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:35,773
One more game. The final one
that will free you forever.

1000
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,825
Do I have your trust?

1001
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,904
Because we can only play
if I have your trust.

1002
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:44,114
Do I have it?

1003
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,826
You are out of your fucking...

1004
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,630
Now listen to me. I want your trust
and I'm gonna have it any way I can.

1005
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:55,925
Now, you will follow
the Reverend's orders.

1006
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,002
Is that clear?

1007
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:02,465
Good.

1008
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:05,594
I believe you'll find this game unique.

1009
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:09,727
It's one you've never played before and
never will again, so make the most of it.

1010
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:12,309
It's known <i>as</i> 'exorcising the demons'.

1011
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:15,103
In my calling,
it's the ultimate salvation.

1012
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,655
And its ends are sacrosanct.

1013
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:22,736
With my ecclesiastic gift,
plus the grace of God,

1014
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:26,039
and a little help from... Superman here,

1015
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:31,374
I shall bestow upon you
the supreme humanitarian blessing

1016
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,705
and give you your freedom.

1017
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,837
You, er, do want that, don't you?

1018
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,717
I knew you would.

1019
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:47,518
What's the game... Reverend?

1020
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:51,188
Sudden death. Now smile.
Smile, pig!

1021
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:53,358
<i>- ~</i> Ah!
<i>- ~</i>

1022
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:57,438
- Why are you doing this?
- Why?

1023
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,399
My mission
has always been your salvation,

1024
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,449
but you never trusted me.

1025
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:06,155
You refused to see.
But I saw.

1026
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,660
I looked at you and I saw myself.

1027
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,334
I saw the same escape,
the same malignancy.

1028
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:15,710
But I know the cure and I know
how desperately you need it.

1029
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:18,086
And only I can give it to you.

1030
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:21,215
- I want to, Joanna.
- Why?

1031
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:24,264
Because it's my gift to you.

1032
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:27,684
Freedom.
The only thing I have left to give.

1033
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:31,605
You refused it once
but this time you have no choice.

1034
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,650
Getting into the part, my love?
I know I am.

1035
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:38,945
Go fuck yourself.

1036
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,318
"Go fuck yourself“?

1037
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:44,822
Not a very nice thing
to say to a man of the cloth.

1038
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:49,281
Remember, scumbag,
I'm here for your benefit. Got that?!

1039
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,041
Healthy looking plants.

1040
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,343
You must water them diligently.

1041
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:05,842
I've always preferred
plastic flowers myself.

1042
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:09,510
I could never bear
to watch the real ones die.

1043
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:12,562
But that's the trouble with living things,
I suppose.

1044
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,731
Inevitably they die.

1045
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:18,022
You've never seen anyone die,
have you?

1046
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:20,024
Certainly not up close.

1047
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:22,572
The swift final gasp and then...

1048
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:25,446
...absolute silence.

1049
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:28,654
The stillness of the body
as the flesh turns white.

1050
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,741
You're terrified right now
because you think of it as death.

1051
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:35,668
But, er, think of it as...

1052
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:38,705
...freedom.

1053
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,755
♪ Forget your troubles,

1054

1059

There's somebody

1060
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:24,797
Then let's not waste any time.

1061
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:31,591
Kill me, Joanna!

1062
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:34,302
Give my life value.
Give me something to die for!

1063
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,934
Save me. You are me!

1064
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:39,766
One of us has to die
so the other can live.

1065
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,997
Kill me, you worthless cunt.

1066
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:59,122
I'm all the men who ever hurt you,
who made you feel like shit.

1067
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:03,082
Who stole your self-respect
and turned you into China Blue. Kill me!

1068
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:06,088
Release the rage.
Get it out. Get even!

1069
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:09,762
Too late.

1070
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,273
Take it out.

1071
01:40:25,478 --> 01:40:27,731
China Blue lives.

1072
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:34,746
Strip, bitch.

1073
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,593
- No!
- Come on.

1074
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:51,296
- I can't.
- Joanna?

1075
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,632
<i>Do it, you bitch!
What are you waiting for?</i>

1076
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:55,887
Joanna?

1077
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:16,370
Jo, are you OK? You OK?

1078
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:34,054
No!

1079
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,329
Goodbye, China Blue.

1080
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,603
I'm here tonight...

1081
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:32,985
...because I wanted
to finally start telling the truth.

1082
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:37,736
My wife and I,
we've split up for good.

1083
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,990
That's right. Me, the boy scout.

1084
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:47,579
I just never had the guts
to admit the truth,

1085
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:51,837
that Amy and I
had just stopped loving each other.

1086
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:56,007
There's nobody to blame.

1087
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:59,298
That's just what happened.

1088
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:03,015
Then...

1089
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:05,892
...I met this woman,

1090
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:08,149
Joanna.

1091
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:13,195
She saved my life.

1092
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,784
We're together now.

1093
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:21,996
I'm not sure if it's gonna work out.

1094
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:26,785
We don't have
a whole hell of a lot in common

1095
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:28,961
other than the fact that...

1096
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:34,338
...we both need help and each other.

1097
01:43:40,256 --> 01:43:43,601
The thing that scared me the most

1098
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,097
during my marriage

1099
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:50,937
was just admitting that I was scared,

1100
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,569
and letting Amy down.

1101
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:59,367
Well, I can't pretend anymore.

1102
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:03,659
I was scared shitless
to come back here.

1103
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,581
I told Joanna.

1104
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:10,545
And she took me in her arms

1105
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,507
and she said,

1106
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:17,586
"it's OK to be scared."

1107
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,850
I felt... stronger.

1108
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:27,512
And freer.

1109
01:44:29,555 --> 01:44:33,731
And more like a man
than I've ever felt before in my life.

1110
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:39,740
Then we fucked our brains out.
