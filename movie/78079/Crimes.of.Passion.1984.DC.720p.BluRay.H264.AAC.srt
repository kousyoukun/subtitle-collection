1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,660
<i>Adam and Eve just had sex, right.</i>

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,488
<i>And God says to Adam,
"Where's Eve?"</i>

3
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,041
<i>So Adam says, "She's down
at the stream, washing off."</i>

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:37,667
<i>God says, "Damn, now I'll never get
that smell out of those fish."</i>

5
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,504
<i>You really think
that's funny, don't you?</i>

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,302
<i>I bet every man here
thinks that's funny.</i>

7
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,554
<i>Ease up, huh?
All of you. Women, Christ!</i>

8
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,135
<i>Getting to be a real pain in the ass.
You know that?</i>

9
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,346
<i>I don't know what's wrong
with the way it used be</i>

10
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,430
<i>when you just did what you were told?</i>

11
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,232
<i>Fuck you, Hopper.</i>

12
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,060
<i>I do, every night.
Me and my jar of Vaseline.</i>

13
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,147
<i>I can fuck any woman I want.
I don't even have to make her cum.</i>

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>Really? I'd rather get fucked
by a vibrator than your cock any day.</i>

15
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,288
<i>It's honest, loving and I don't have
to make breakfast for it in the morning.</i>

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,328
You remind me of my ex-wife.
She had an answer for everything.

17
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,879
Like whenever people
would ask her what I did.

18
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,456
She'd say, "He struggles."

19
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,133
You guys, you all think
you are the victim.

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,178
Hey, wait a minute.
I think we're taking a bum rap here.

21
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,096
I happen to be a very giving lover.

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,051
Yeah, you're giving alright.
You gave half the city the clap.

23
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,104
Alright, enough.

24
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,432
Mr Grady.
You've been awfully quiet.

25
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:43,066
I know it's your first night with the group
but is there anything you'd like to say.

26
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:49,778
No, I just came as a guest.
My buddy Hopper over here brought me.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,865
I know. But surely you must
have something to say about all this.

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,416
I mean, you are planning
to stay with us?

29
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,916
Me? Why, me, I'm happy.

30
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,882
Been married to the same woman
for 11 years.

31
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,127
Been together since high school.
We have two kids.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,680
Cut the crap. You wouldn't be
here if something wasn't bugging you.

33
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,511
I told you, I'm here with Hopper.
I have a great marriage.

34
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:20,228
I don't understand all these...
hang-ups with you people.

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,564
I've never cheated on my wife
in ten years.

36
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,271
I thought it was 11?

37
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,574
I've never met a man
yet who'd admit he was a lousy lay.

38
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,949
What's that supposed to mean?
You think everything has to do with sex?

39
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,327
Admit it. You're a lousy lay
and she's learnt to accept it.

40
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,579
- Like we all had to.
- Wait a minute!

41
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,248
- You think I'm a lousy lay?
- You got it.

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,051
I'm not the one who complains
how tired I am every night.

43
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,843
Getting her to make love...

44
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,014
It's like asking her to run
the Boston Marathon.

45
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,309
And then when we actually
go through with it,

46
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,807
I don't know whether
to embrace her or embalm her.

47
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,480
So don't tell me that I'm a lousy lay.

48
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,270
What am I saying?
What the hell am I doing here?

49
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,743
Oh, thank you, ladies and gentleman.

50
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,786
I'm grateful
from the bottom of my heart.

51
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:23,086
It is truly an honour
to be named Miss Liberty 1984.

52
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,549
I have dreamed
of this moment all my life.

53
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:32,630
And I promise I shall carry the name
with dignity and with pride.

54
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:38,936
I will always serve my country
and be a shining beacon of hope

55
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,308
to nations the world over.

56
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:48,192
Spreading the true spirit
of freedom and liberty that is America.

57
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,443
Oh, we're proud of you, Miss Liberty.

58
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,196
What do you plan to do
with your scholarship money?

59
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,997
Well. I plan to study music, sir.

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,497
Music, do you say?
What kind of instrument do you play?

61
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,499
I play the flute, sir.

62
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:09,800
In honour of our forefathers
who died at Concord and Lexington.

63
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,133
Would you like to see
how Miss Liberty plays the flute?

64
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,307
Oh, yes. Yes, very much.

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,104
First, I unzip the case.

66
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:31,440
And then I take out the instrument
very carefully. I'm very gentle.

67
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,401
And then I run my little hand all over it.

68
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:40,035
Up and down. Then up and down.

69
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:47,079
And then I fondle it so softly.
So softly.

70
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,754
I love the look of it.

71
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:59,767
Oh, I love the feel of it.
So smooth and firm.

72
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,605
I like to wrap my fingers around it
and tenderly caress it.

73
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,363
Then I like to lift it to my mouth.

74
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,705
And wrap my lips around it.

75
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:29,247
And then I just wait for that sweet,
sweet music to come pouring out.

76
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,626
Fucking incredible. Oh!

77
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,712
Fucking incredible!

78
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,638
Fucking incredible!

79
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,014
I knew it would be.

80
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,317
You knew it would be too, didn't you?
Ha-ha.

81
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,696
We know each other so well.
You know what I mean?

82
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,734
What did you say your name was?

83
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,161
China Blue.

84
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,995
No, I mean your real name.

85
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,377
Miss Liberty.

86
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,832
Well, that was some game of yours,
Miss Liberty!

87
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,509
You wanted romance.

88
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,214
My name is Carl
and I just split up with my wife.

89
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,469
It's gettin" late babe. Got to move.

90
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,056
Can I see you again?

91
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,684
I work the street. Keep an eye out.

92
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,022
It's just that it's been so long
since I got a hard-on just...

93
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,691
looking at someone.

94
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,782
We were married 12 years.

95
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,616
She just walked out on me.
Just like that.

96
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,702
I don't know what it was I did wrong.

97
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,662
I know what you mean.

98
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,215
My ex beat it out the door
when he was tired of beating me.

99
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,917
Is that true?

100
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,505
Does it matter?

101
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,562
Yeah, well.
I'll see you around, China Blue.

102
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,266
Oh, put the cash on the dresser.

103
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,096
Hey! Shit!

104
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:37,564
"Dear God! The heathen are come
unto thine inheritance.

105
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,896
"Thy holy temple, have they defiled.

106
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,198
"They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

107
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,447
"Their blood have they shed
like water round Jerusalem."

108
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,325
- Like, like, like...
- This guy is crazy.

109
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,284
They fuck and they piss and they shit
like the fucking scum they are.

110
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:59,715
Dear God, hallowed is Thy name...
In the spirit of Lucifer.

111
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,962
Forgive me Lord. Forgive me.

112
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,969
How long, Lord,
shalt thou be angry forever?

113
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,471
Shall they jealously burn like fire?

114
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,602
Shall we keep on
fucking and pissing into this.

115
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:23,439
Forgive me, Lord.
That was... that was not me.

116
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,418
You child, victim of the night.

117
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,542
I am the Reverend Peter Shayne
and I know the plague that cripples you.

118
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:44,172
I've been sent by the Lord to save you
and to rid the earth of that plague.

119
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,127
I am His holy messenger.

120
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,468
Do you recognise me, child?

121
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,976
Sorry, I never forget a face.

122
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,524
Especially when I've sat on it.

123
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,028
- Save your soul, whore.
- Save your money, shithead.

124
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,557
I'm sorry, man. I didn't think
they'd come down on you so hard.

125
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,769
Forget it. Come on in and see the shop.
You haven't seen it for a while.

126
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,316
- Hey, Jerry!
- Good to see you, Grady.

127
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,868
How come you're still here?
I thought Mollie was sick.

128
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,945
They're coming
to pick this up tomorrow.

129
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,076
Can't afford to lose customers,
you know.

130
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,376
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll finish it up. Now, get out of here.

131
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,454
- Your wife is sick. You should be home.
- Well, thanks, Grady.

132
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,585
You know, you're the only one left
who gives a damn.

133
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,588
<i>' What do
- Erry!</i>

134
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,728
Step on it.

135
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,056
What you afraid of? Step on it!

136
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,943
Got you surrounded.

137
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,023
- Still playing games?
- It'll scare the hell out of any thief.

138
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,450
<i>Do not attempt to escape.
Keep your hands up.</i>

139
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,280
Bobby, about that session.
Things must be pretty rough at home.

140
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,833
Things are great.
Just got a little wound up, that's all.

141
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,662
Like I said, still playing games.

142
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,295
You should talk. All the bodies
floating in and out of that bed.

143
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,423
That's some kind of life, pal.
Spend half of it changing sheets.

144
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,928
Sheila called me yesterday
for the first time since the divorce.

145
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,052
Still can't let her go, Bobby.

146
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,308
Well, I got a great idea.

147
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,187
Amy invited Sheila to the barbecue
on Sunday with Tommy and Patty.

148
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,940
So why don't you come?
It'll just be like old times.

149
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,920
Who's there?

150
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,825
I didn't hurt you, did I?

151
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,495
A little rougher this time
than usual.

152
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,704
Don't worry, 'sweet dick'. I'm tough.

153
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,161
"Sweet dick"?

154
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,749
Do me a favour next time.
Don't walk so fast. Hard to keep up.

155
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,922
Maybe I should rape you, huh?

156
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,379
One way to get back at your old man.

157
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,885
- Sorry?
- Your father.

158
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,262
I know he raped you
when you were a kid.

159
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,811
You told me the first time
we were at it together.

160
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,139
<i>Oh, yeah. I forgot.</i>

161
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,977
<i>- You said you trusted me.
- I do. You're the only one I told.</i>

162
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,895
It is true, isn't it?

163
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,901
- Sure it's true.
- Well, you don't seem too upset.

164
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,031
You were almost in tears
when you told me.

165
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:07,241
I'm trying to block it out of my mind.
Can't you understand?

166
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,873
I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was still a sore spot.

167
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,579
Not as sore as it was then.

168
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:23,223
Maybe, if you're real nice to me
I'll tell you all about the time

169
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,221
he tied my arms to the bed
with black twine.

170
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,644
Did he really do that?

171
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,438
He did that
to a sweet little thing like you?

172
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,391
See the scars.

173
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,228
- Where?
- Look closer.

174
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,072
Oh, yeah. I see.

175
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,989
How low can you get?

176
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,284
As low as you can afford.
And your meter's up pal.

177
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,585
That's the bitter truth.

178
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,754
Can I keep these?

179
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,877
For ten bucks.

180
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,254
Keep the trust.

181
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,343
I'm sorry I'm late honey.
I had to finish up.

182
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,302
- I ate with the kids.
- Well, I brought dessert.

183
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,230
- Thanks. You know I'm on a diet.
- Open it.

184
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,898
Da-da!

185
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,029
Have you eaten?

186
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm not hungry.
I'll fix something later.

187
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,987
Dinner's still warm.

188
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,698
Listen, I invited Donny
to the party on Sunday.

189
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,829
You know, he and Sheila
have been speaking.

190
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,082
- Or at least she called him.
- Are you crazy?

191
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,256
She only called him
'cause he was late with the alimony.

192
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,092
So how are the kids?

193
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,928
Jimmy needs braces. The dentist
says he has an overlapping bite.

194
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,428
Will they hurt?

195
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,478
I'm not concerned
whether it will hurt or not.

196
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,268
Well, if he needs braces, honey,
give him the braces.

197
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,738
- Just like that.
- Yeah, just like that.

198
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,988
So we'll go another year without
a hot tub. We can use Larson's.

199
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,947
Sure, and when we need a new car
we can just borrow the Murphys'.

200
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,533
I can borrow my sister's Cuisinart
and Sally's microwave.

201
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,086
And Kathy just got a new video recorder.
It cost 1,000 bucks.

202
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,710
She says it'll do anything she wants.

203
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,383
Well, for that price,
she should go down on him.

204
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,299
Very funny.

205
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,685
Did you talk to Jerry?

206
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,273
So where's the salt?

207
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,442
- You didn't, did you?
- Don't we have any salt?

208
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,611
<i>- Bobby!
' Amy, I told you!</i>

209
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,526
I am not letting the guy go.
I don't care how slow things are.

210
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,782
He's got a wife and kids.

211
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,364
And what do you have?

212
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,327
Maybe if you'd gone into a real business
like a normal person...

213
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,503
It's on the stove.

214
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,672
No wonder we never have any money!

215
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,093
Amy, look, I love that business.
I'm proud of it.

216
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,427
I work damn hard at it.
We'll make out OK.

217
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,853
Haven't let you down yet, have I?

218
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,728
So, who the hell needs a hot tub?
Who needs a bathtub?

219
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,988
Thinking of which,
why don't you and I...

220
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,075
go upstairs
and take a bath together?

221
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,994
We could certainly use a bit
of adventure in our lives.

222
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,657
I'm really not in the mood
for a little adventure.

223
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,792
So what kind of lousy mood are you in?
Did you get your period today?!

224
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,840
No, I did not get my period today.

225
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,966
Every time I'm in a lousy mood,
you think I've got my period.

226
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,797
I wish.

227
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,929
By stocking Tampax I'll retire.

228
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,697
There is nothing
that means more to me...

229
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,196
than this family.

230
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,408
Not even some stupid hot tub.

231
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,295
I have to clean up.

232
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,096
Hey! What are you guys still doing up?
Do you know what time it is?

233
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,272
Mum said we can stay up
till the next commercial.

234
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,190
No, you can't,

235
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,857
'cause you're under attack.
It's bombs away!

236
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,155
Watch out, here it comes!

237
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,586
Why don't you give your sister
time on it, cowboy?

238
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,379
Come on, you too. March, up!

239
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,332
Did you hear the joke about...?

240
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,670
Yeah, well don't worry about it,
because it's bedtime. Isn't it, Daddy?

241
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,013
- Come on. Let's go!
- Give Daddy a big hug.

242
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,567
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

243
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,355
<i>- Hello?
- Walt Pierson here.</i>

244
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,364
- Bobby Grady! How are you doin'?
- Great. You?

245
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,320
Yeah, I'm just fine, thanks.

246
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:24,705
Urn, listen. You asked me about doing
some night time surveillance for you.

247
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,082
<i>Yes. Do you think
you might still be interested?</i>

248
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:32,383
Yeah. Well, I was wondering
is the offer still good?

249
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,335
<i>You got to work nights, though.</i>

250
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,924
No problem. I could use the money.

251
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,510
<i>- I think I've got something for you.
- You do? Terrific.</i>

252
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,142
<i>- You got to work nights, though.
- No, no, that's great.</i>

253
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,521
<i>- You didn't think I had the nerve!
- No, I didn't.</i>

254
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,446
Neither did I.
I guess it just comes with poverty.

255
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,865
<i>Come on in and we'll talk about it.</i>

256
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,285
Yeah, well, thank you very much
and you take it easy.

257
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,239
<i>- Yeah, right. See you tomorrow.
- Fine. Bye.</i>

258
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,668
You tell them jokes and I'm the wicked
witch who sends them to bed.

259
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,454
Well, I'll put them to bed.

260
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,088
What, and keep them up
half the night with your stories?

261
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,262
It's good for the imagination.

262
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,090
Theirs or yours?

263
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,471
I'm going to be doing
some tracking for Walt Pierson,

264
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,555
so it means you can make room
for that hot tub.

265
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:32,902
You act like I've... forced you.
I don't even want it anymore.

266
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,739
Well, what do you want?
Do you know?

267
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,816
And you didn't force me.

268
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,540
Maybe I'll do the magic act at the party.

269
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,292
You know, for laughs.
What do you think?

270
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,596
Whatever you want.

271
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,139
Oh, Bobby, come on. Stop it.
We just got the cable.

272
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,022
Walt Pierson speaks very highly of you.

273
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,197
I've a lot of respect for Walt.
His word's good enough for me.

274
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:45,651
I'm damn good at what I do, Mr Bateman, but
I'll only take a job if I can do it right.

275
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,705
As long as you keep it quiet. I don't
want to turn this into a major event.

276
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,829
I've always been a pushover
for industrial espionage.

277
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,287
I'd like to help you.
Just tell me what the facts are.

278
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:02,173
I'm one of the largest manufacturers of
ladies' sportswear outside of New York,

279
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,721
but I'm falling behind
for the first time in 2O years.

280
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,720
Last week's orders
were at an all-time low.

281
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,474
I believe someone
in my organisation is selling patterns

282
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,226
to one of my competitors.

283
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,478
- I want you to follow her.
- Who is she?

284
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,560
The young woman's
been with me about two years.

285
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,738
Very talented designer.
Hell of a future, if she hasn't blown it.

286
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,942
- What makes you think it's her?
- I don't know. Gut feeling.

287
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,574
There's something about her.
I'll point her out to you.

288
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,247
Try and save some yardage
in the sleeve, OK?

289
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,074
That's her, in the grey suit.

290
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,537
How could someone
that looks like that be a criminal?

291
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,465
That's what I'm paying you to find out.

292
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,464
Follow her, where she goes at night,
what she does.

293
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,887
- Morning, Lou.
- Phil.

294
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,345
What do you mean,
"there's something about her"?

295
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,268
She's a mystery. Divorced.
Lives alone.

296
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,687
No boyfriends I know of. A real loner.

297
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,937
- What's she like in here?
- Impulsive, ambitious.

298
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,734
Never stops working,
never satisfied.

299
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,811
You know the type.
Always proving themselves.

300
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,398
- Perfection or bust.
- Any friends?

301
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,483
She gets along fine
with the other women.

302
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,445
But if you've got a penis,
you're in trouble. She turns to ice.

303
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,531
- That still doesn't make her a criminal.
- It makes her a suspect.

304
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:17,790
I don't trust anyone that works that hard.
She must be hiding something.

305
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,963
- I want you to nail her lily white ass.
- What the hell is this?

306
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,009
- You think she's that dangerous?
- It depends on what you discover.

307
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,437
Paradise Hotel. 4th and Main.

308
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,543
Hey, this is a fucking pain
in my ass.

309
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:23,559
- Do you recognise me tonight, child?
- Ha! Well, if it isn't my saviour!

310
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:29,230
The Reverend Peter Shayne requests
a few moments of repose upstairs,

311
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,152
in your holy of holies.

312
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,276
A reverend, no less.

313
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:39,203
You know, the last reverend who tried
t0, er, save me... lived to regret it.

314
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,407
I chased him all around the church
until I caught him by the organ.

315
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,418
Come on.

316
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,376
I make a great Joan of Arc.
Can't you tell?

317
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,757
I imagine you do spend a good deal
of your time on your knees, my child.

318
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,601
Excuse us.
We've got business to conduct here.

319
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,942
Hi, baby! How about a shot
of the Grand Canyon, huh?

320
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,902
Holy shit!

321
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,712
Stick it there, Rev.

322
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,544
What do you want?

323
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,048
I want t0 help you.
Admit you need it.

324
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,004
I need it.

325
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,057
With conviction.
Make me believe.

326
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,636
Oh, please, Reverend.
You're so good and wise and strong.

327
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,394
Please help this sick,
disgusting degenerate.

328
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,728
I deal in truth. I'm bringing you
something greater than a hard-on,

329
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,313
assuming you consider truth
to be greater than a hard-on.

330
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,740
- Depends on the hard-on.
- Try it again, sinner.

331
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:14,131
First month I was married, I tried t0
make my husband's favourite casserole.

332
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,004
I made a mess.

333
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,212
So I cried to my best friend Peggy
all week about it,

334
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,888
till I found out that
when I was in the kitchen making it,

335
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,386
he was in the bedroom
making Peggy.

336
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,766
Don't stare at me.

337
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,475
You're wearing your anguish
like a breakaway chastity belt.

338
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,400
You wanted the truth.

339
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,729
What else are you selling?

340
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,075
This is a fantasy business, Reverend.

341
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,245
You can have any truth you want.

342
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,574
And so can you.
Isn't that why you're here?

343
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,628
- Isn't that why you are?
- I'm here to save you.

344
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,922
Why don't you fuck me?
That'll save me.

345
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,920
Not from your disease.

346
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,344
What disease?
I'm healthy as a horse.

347
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,549
I'm fit as a fiddle and ready for cock.

348
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,226
Whores and metaphors don't mix.
Who are you?

349
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,271
I'm Cinderella, Cleopatra,

350
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:15,226
Goldie Hawn, Eva Braun.
I'm Little Miss Muffin, Pocahontas.

351
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,310
I'm whoever you want me to be,
Reverend.

352
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,692
But what are you doing here?

353
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,820
- Satisfying.
- Who?

354
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,745
- I think the confessional is about over.
- Don't you want to be saved?

355
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,868
- Do you get that much out of this?
- I get paid.

356
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,951
I'm not interested in what you're selling,
only what you're buying.

357
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,832
Why don't you assume
the missionary position, Reverend?

358
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,039
My purpose here is totally humanitarian.

359
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,377
- To make me see the light?
- To make you see through the bullshit.

360
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,555
<i>You want truth, Father?
I give the best truth in town.</i>

361
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,973
<i>So good, you wouldn't
know it from make believe.</i>

362
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,302
<i>- Is it?
- If you believe it is.</i>

363
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,481
Everybody needs something
to believe in, don't they, Reverend?

364
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,901
Bow down, 0 Lord, and hear me
for I am poor and needy.

365
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,479
Preserve my soul, for I am holy.

366
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,442
O Thou, my God.
Save thy servant, that trusteth in Thee.

367
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:09,655
Save him from this bigmouth cooze
with a motor driven ass.

368
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:14,039
Forgive me, Lord. I speak not in vain
but this little bitch provokes me so.

369
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,042
Oh, Jesus!
At least I can stay in character.

370
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,547
You couldn't even get a walk-on, unless
it was you that was being walked on.

371
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,720
I am a messenger of God,
you little cocksucker!

372
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,796
What's this, your mail bag?
Let's see what's in it

373
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,927
No!

374
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,384
- What is this, top secret?
- No.

375
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,265
Let Mama have a little peak.

376
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,847
What have you got in here,
the Holy Grail?

377
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:40,186
Oh, my God! Oh, excuse me, oh God!

378
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,818
Need I remind you, Jezebel,
that curiosity killed the cat.

379
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,400
Not until it got out of the bag.

380
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,487
These are the Devil's playthings.
Those who touch them will burn.

381
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,493
Put another log on the fire, Reverend.
Let's see a sample.

382
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,293
- It's a disgusting array.
- Disgusting's my middle name, honey.

383
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,747
- What have you got in the bag?
- God, forgive me.

384
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,672
A tit pacifier.

385
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,880
That milk of human kindness,
remedial, even in simulation.

386
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:14,808
A foam rubber pretty kitty, already house
broken. You can teach it new tricks.

387
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,935
It comes with a battery pack.
It's in here somewhere.

388
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,101
An auto-suck.

389
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,984
Modern technology at its most
compassionate, and it swallows.

390
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,033
This one is a little on the blink.

391
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:33,330
Oh, are you hungry? How about
a beat-me-eat-me liquorice whip?

392
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,284
The taste that leaves its mark forever.

393
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:40,621
Hey, no. Wait a minute.
I'm not through here. What else you got?

394
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,416
What?

395
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,635
What the hell?

396
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,849
Is this a cruise missile or a Pershing?

397
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,155
What are you gonna do?
Fuck someone to death?

398
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,531
You'd like to, wouldn't you?

399
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,829
Only the right woman.

400
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,660
I've got to go.

401
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,834
Just when we're making progress.

402
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,832
I can only handle
one revelation a night.

403
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,711
Enough of them
and you might be able to handle real life.

404
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,384
Real life, Reverend?

405
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,680
Tell me your name,
or is that a tough one?

406
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,760
China Blue.

407
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:40,393
I like it. It's rather exotic,
like something out of Charlie Chan.

408
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,725
B-movies have always
been my inspiration.

409
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,980
<i>What's yours'?
Going My Way?</i>

410
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,907
All you need to know about me
is that I intend to save you.

411
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,653
And all you need to do is... be there.

412
00:35:56,196 --> 00:36:00,576
Stay with me, China Blue.
Trust me. I'll free you.

413
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,043
Who are you?
You're not a Reverend. Who are you?

414
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,796
<i>I'm you.</i>

415
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,315
<i>I will sing of mercy and judgment.</i>

416
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,893
<i>Unto thee, o Lord, will I sing.</i>

417
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,196
<i>I will behave myself wisely
in a perfect way.</i>

418
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,273
<i>I will walk within my house
with a perfect heart</i>

419
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,859
<i>and I will set no wicked thing
before mine eyes.</i>

420
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:25,622
<i>Not even the stupid douchebag
who's luring me into her rotten spell.</i>

421
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,950
<i>The snatch can't fool me, Lord.</i>

422
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,956
<i>I'm not like the others.
I know her cowardly game.</i>

423
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:35,165
<i>A fear of men so great, she can
only feel strength behind her facade.</i>

424
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,427
"Who so slandereth his neighbour,
will I cut off."

425
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,387
I'll cut off, alright.

426
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,470
I'll cut off... her little tits.

427
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,745
Why didn't you come to me, Phil?
I would have loaned you the money.

428
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,673
- Hell, I would have given you the money.
- Goddamn pride.

429
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,592
What about jail? No pride in there.

430
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,798
Who thinks? Cooper offered me
a fortune for the patterns.

431
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,224
I lost control!

432
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,558
Please, Lou.
I'll work for nothing.

433
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,898
Anything you want.

434
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,944
What this would do
to Sarah and my boy...

435
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,899
I'll have to think about it, Phil.

436
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:42,259
I had to have someone around here
to talk to about this whole damn thing.

437
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,758
The man's been with me 18 years.
I trusted him.

438
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:51,392
He was so moved that I did
that he broke down and confessed.

439
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,141
That's gratitude for you.

440
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,814
I didn't know my trust meant that much.

441
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,771
What do I do now?

442
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,450
- Give him another chance.
- The man is a criminal.

443
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,653
Come on. You heard his motive.

444
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:12,410
The guy's only human.
He knows he was wrong.

445
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:16,584
God knows we've all made mistakes.
Why ruin his life over one mistake?

446
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,833
- What about the law?
- Screw the law.

447
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,464
What good is he in jail?

448
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,168
Beside, he'll work twice
as hard for you here.

449
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,596
And you can feel like the king of hearts.

450
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,554
I don't know
what's right or wrong anymore.

451
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,355
- Did you really believe it was her?
- So I'm a lousy guesser.

452
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,353
What did you get on her?

453
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,645
Not much. She stayed home all night.

454
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,243
<i>- Is that you, Joe?
- Are you free?</i>

455
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,449
No, but I'm one hell of a bargain.

456
00:42:55,531 --> 00:43:00,128
I meant, are you available.
You know... for action.

457
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:05,505
Action? Soldier, for 5O bucks,
you can name your own battlefield.

458
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:19,355
I'm sorry! I'm not too good at this.
It's my first time.

459
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,650
Oh? Are you that desperate
or that horny?

460
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,897
- I'm married.
- Oh, that desperate and that horny.

461
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,114
Go slow! I'm just... a boy scout.

462
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:37,791
Well, baby, you are about
to become an explorer.

463
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,084
Oh, hot body!

464
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,673
- Are you an athlete?
- Yeah.

465
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,965
Played varsity football, high school.

466
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,019
- Quarterback.
- Mm.

467
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:03,020
Well, Quarterback,
you can have the ride of your life,

468
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,851
if you trust me at the wheel.

469
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,278
Sit down.

470
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,740
How, er, good a driver are you?

471
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,574
Who said anything about driving?
Driving's what you do with your wife.

472
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,000
Here, we fly.

473
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,918
Sound good, lover?

474
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,463
Bet you and your wife
haven't done much flying, right?

475
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,883
Shit, me and my wife haven't
been doing much driving lately.

476
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,428
<i>I'm ready for take-off.</i>

477
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,677
You're on standby, babe.
I got a full load.

478
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,760
<i>OK, but next week it's first class.</i>

479
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,274
Who are you?

480
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,943
It's not a prom date, sweetie.
I'm a hooker, you're a trick.

481
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,241
Why ruin a perfect relationship?

482
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,453
Here, have a Quaalude.

483
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,957
To float. You'll love it, I promise.
Flyer never lies.

484
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,562
Fasten your seatbelt, honey,

485
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,765
and say hello to freedom.

486
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:43,375
Good evening.
Welcome to China Blue Airlines flight 69,

487
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,451
non-stop service to paradise.

488
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,708
We'll be taking off shortly.
I'll be unbuckling your belt

489
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:55,261
and seeing that big bird rise and rise,

490
00:45:55,336 --> 00:46:00,638
finally settling into the comfort
only this wide body can provide.

491
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,812
We're here to serve you.

492
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:10,101
Please remember that although
we may run out of Panam coffee,

493
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:15,190
we'll never run out of TWA tea.

494
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,325
<i>Hey, Ivory soap.</i>

495
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:17,375
<i>99 and 44/100% pure.
Kind of funny, isn't it?</i>

496
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,383
<i>- That guy...
- Don't say it.</i>

497
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,464
<i>You don't even know
what I was going to say.</i>

498
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,175
Do you?

499
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,307
<i>- Why are you in a hurry?
- Me?</i>

500
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,764
<i>You raced for that shower
like it was the Indy 500.</i>

501
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,066
<i>You couldn't wait to wash it off,
could you?</i>

502
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,984
<i>- Now wait a minute...
- No problem.</i>

503
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,438
<i>Hey, I know the boy scout oath.
"Cleanliness is next to godliness."</i>

504
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,148
<i>How the hell would you know?</i>

505
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,733
<i>You haven't been
next to one in years.</i>

506
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,693
<i>What I do in this room
might not win me a Purple Heart</i>

507
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,995
<i>but it sure as shit
beats the PTA meeting.</i>

508
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,331
Why are we acting like this?

509
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:01,206
I thought fucking was supposed
to bring people closer together,

510
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:05,415
- not drive them apart.
- Is that what it did for your marriage?

511
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,095
What we did tonight...

512
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:16,676
You felt it too, didn't you?
You weren't just acting.

513
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,261
You felt what I did.

514
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,648
Tell me, please. I have to know.

515
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,819
Would you, um...?

516
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,611
Would you maybe
like to see me again?

517
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,569
Yes.

518
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,953
But I can't.

519
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,166
Well, you know there are three things

520
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,339
you have to know to be able
to make it as 5O buck hooker.

521
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,509
You have to act, fuck
and know how to count to 50.

522
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,678
You're lucky, you've seen all three.

523
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:56,428
<i>Close the door on your way out.
There are a lot of creeps around here.</i>

524
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,701
Ready when you are, CB.

525
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,419
Not tonight, OK.

526
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,842
Freedom requires treatment.

527
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,674
Just leave me alone.

528
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,755
I would if I thought you wanted me to.

529
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,432
Get out.

530
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,350
Women, you mystify me.

531
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:44,681
The extremes you go to for a little
validation, but you still go home alone.

532
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,818
What's your mystery, Reverend?

533
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,987
Authority never reveals itself.

534
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,064
Huh. Why?

535
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:59,154
Are you afraid I'll stop believing,
or afraid you will?

536
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,831
Those are the rules.
My 50, my game, my rules.

537
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,579
Game's over, fraud.

538
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,632
The game's never over.

539
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,835
That's what you're here for, isn't it?

540
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,547
- I don't feel like playing games.
- I think you do.

541
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,802
Consider the alternative.

542
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:25,638
You want a game? Go sit down!

543
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:30,860
Onward, Christian soldiers!

544
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,108
Marching as to war

545
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,566
With the cross of Jesus...

546
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,275
Stop it!

547
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,407
Going on before

548
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:44,240
Come on, stud!

549
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,417
Give it to me. It's all a game.

550
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,961
Fly! Do what you want!
You want freedom?

551
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,038
You need to manipulate
women to feel like a man?

552
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,748
Do it! That's what we're here for.

553
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,833
Like you manipulate men
to feel like a woman?

554
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:56,919
- Let go, damn you.
- Why, it's only a game.

555
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,845
- Let go, I said.
- It hurts, doesn't it?

556
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,969
- Let go, you fuck!
- Tell me it hurts.

557
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,516
Yes, it hurts!

558
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,014
You see, you can feel.

559
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,574
I'm sorry...

560
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,204
How was it, huh? Not bad?

561
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,085
PhD in emotionalism, huh?

562
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,794
I have accepted reality.
I'm cured.

563
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,719
Free at last!

564
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,172
Shit!

565
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,054
You self-righteous son of a bitch!

566
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,601
I can play your goddamn game
as well as you can

567
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,476
and I don't use religion
t0 pump myself up.

568
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,275
If you're a minister, I'm Snow White.

569
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,105
Yes, but, what fun
it is playing the part.

570
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,361
- Would you leave now, please?
- That was quite a performance.

571
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,534
There's no limit t0 my talents.

572
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,112
You're the head of your class,
or is it the...

573
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,540
- ...class of your head?
- Oh, a man of words.

574
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,869
He makes up in diction
what he lacks in click.

575
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,798
Lesson for today.

576
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,501
I've written you a poem.
Would you like t0 hear it?

577
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,678
<i>Behold this wicked woman</i>

578
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:25,098
<i>She falls, she mends,
she crawls, she bends</i>

579
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,268
<i>She sucks it, fucks it,
picks it up and licks it</i>

580
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,313
<i>You can whip her, beat her,
maul her, mistreat her</i>

581
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,062
<i>Anything you want
as long as you don't touch her</i>

582
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:37,566
Get out of here. Take your
goddamn truth and get out of here!

583
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,646
Show her affection, she turns to stone.

584
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,607
You haven't had
your 50 dollars worth yet!

585
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,443
- Come back her, listen to me!
- Get away from me!

586
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:49,122
- Urgh! You...!
- Do you know what you are?

587
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:53,873
A cheap painted slut
who makes a fortune selling illusions.

588
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,750
Ah!

589
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,666
One of your regulars, my dear?

590
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,626
Rather eager tonight, isn't he?

591
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:09,719
I guess I taught that guy a lesson.

592
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:13,681
That was no guy.
That was my saviour.

593
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,277
I've never been fought over before.
Only been fought.

594
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,777
Yeah, well, it's tough work.
You can't please everyone.

595
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,530
Oh, I didn't mean this work.
In this work, I can please everyone.

596
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,988
Come on. What are you still doing
hanging around here anyway?

597
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,870
It's OK. I'm not helpless.

598
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,329
I guess I could use some help.

599
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:45,508
Thanks for the help just then.
Or the attempt anyway.

600
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,760
Yeah, we're not all out t0 get you.

601
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,098
Now go on home to your wife.

602
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,817
I wish I could tell her,

603
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,441
the way you made me feel.

604
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,190
She'll say it's part of my imagination.

605
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,910
It was.

606
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,341
Can I have another pancake?

607
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,426
No, you cannot have another pancake.

608
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:36,264
You had two already.
Fat girls do not get married.

609
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,189
Bobby, are you OK?

610
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,021
What? Yeah, I'm fine.

611
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,359
Did you do something to your hair?

612
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,832
Yeah, I cut it last week.
Glad you noticed.

613
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,003
Excuse me. Here you go, Dad.

614
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,629
When are you going to fix
my garbage disposal?

615
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,836
I'll have a look at it.
It might need a plumber.

616
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,386
You can fix it, Dad.

617
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,432
Daddy, will you teach me
how to plant a garden?

618
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,055
Why me, Kiddo? Your mom'll teach you.

619
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,228
Daddy doesn't know
how to plant a garden.

620
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,185
Amy, it's really not that hard.

621
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,982
Honey, easy!
You know I don't like maple syrup.

622
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,404
Of course you like maple syrup.

623
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:28,107
When have you known me
t0 like maple syrup?

624
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,238
I don't want to argue with you.

625
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,365
I'm not arguing.

626
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,572
Dad, what's strontium-90.

627
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,748
It's a term for a radioactive fallout.

628
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,451
- He asked me, Amy.
- I didn't think you'd know what it is.

629
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,208
- Of course I know what it is.
- What is it?

630
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,382
It's a term for a radioactive fallout.

631
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:48,301
Brilliant. Isn't your daddy brilliant?

632
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:54,429
- What does the 90 mean?
- Yeah, hon, what does the 90 mean?

633
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:57,387
Tell us, Daddy, hm? You're the expert.

634
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,265
It means... that er...

635
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:06,695
that you have 90 days
to get an antidote or you die.

636
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,993
I think you'd better ask
your teacher, Jimmy.

637
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,162
I've got to get to work.

638
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,532
Daddy left food on his plate.

639
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,668
Daddy doesn't follow the rules.
He only makes them.

640
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,468
Goodbye. Give Daddy a kiss.

641
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,294
200 for a three-way.

642
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:12,048
- You got a radio?
- We've got whatever you want.

643
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,004
Health insurance?

644
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,400
Want to get to heaven early?

645
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,429
Maybe we should make him
an offer at 14.

646
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,677
He's got so much stock already,
he might cooperate.

647
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:01,010
We can't go lower than 18.
It's an insult.

648
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,813
I refuse to pay that opportunistic
bastard more than he deserves.

649
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,311
It's a matter of principle.

650
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,696
I'm still worried
about Fenley coming through, though.

651
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:16,401
The man has absolutely no sense
of morality. Don't you agree, dear?

652
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,451
<i>Mmhm.</i>

653
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,621
I'd like to finalise this
before Laurie comes home for vacation.

654
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,124
Hope she isn't bringing that boy
she's seeing. You know, the Jew.

655
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,046
Not that I'm a bigot or anything.

656
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,374
You know the work
I've done for crippled children.

657
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,880
If he's Jewish,
what are we gonna do with him?

658
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,133
God knows we can't take him
to the country club.

659
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:40,261
Claudia, have you ever heard
of a Jew who didn't play golf?

660
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,446
Arthur, don't stick your tongue in her ear.

661
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,740
You have to be careful
with these people.

662
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,910
You don't know what kind of germs
they could be carrying.

663
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,534
Stop this crate!

664
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,748
Close the deal quick
before your tongue drops off.

665
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,634
- The kids hate this salad.
- Where are they?

666
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,387
They're at my mom's.

667
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,936
Guess who we just saw.
Janey Durant.

668
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,015
Remember, Amy? She beat you out
for head cheerleader.

669
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,442
- What a slut.
- She's not a slut.

670
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,315
She went to Ohio State.

671
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,238
Every two years they let a slut
into Ohio State.

672
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,692
Her timing was good.

673
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,655
I sat next to her in Biology.
She was always dropping her frog.

674
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:30,493
- What's she doing now?
- She's a waitress at Seafood Heaven.

675
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,374
- Didn't she marry Lenny Harris?
- That nerd?

676
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,797
He sat behind me in English
and tied mirrors to his shoes

677
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,795
so he could look up my dress.

678
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,127
Shit! What are you talking about?
That was me!

679
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,008
I knew it was some nerd.

680
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:45,014
It's OK. I've got one.

681
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,343
- Isn't it flat?
- I like it flat.

682
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,427
You never liked it flat
when we were married.

683
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,605
I never liked anything
when we were married.

684
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,478
OK, team. Get it while it's hot.

685
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,527
He thinks he's still in high school.

686
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,318
Alright!

687
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,276
You've got mustard all over!

688
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,244
OK, everybody.
Look at me and smile.

689
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,163
One or the other. We can't do both.

690
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,837
One more for posterity.

691
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,556
Promise me
you won't do the magic act.

692
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,688
- What? You told me you liked it.
- I lied.

693
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,861
Donny... Donny!

694
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,692
I think it's time for the old HP.
A little nostalgia for the gang.

695
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,197
You rat porker!

696
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:51,623
- Does Amy know?
- I thought I'd surprise her.

697
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:56,579
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention
please. We have a treat in store.

698
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,459
That dumb magic act.

699
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,131
It's no magic act.

700
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,882
Live on our stage,
direct from the wild jungles of Borneo...

701
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,840
Ah, damn! It's the old ace pick.

702
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,720
Skill and daring,

703
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,847
ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves,

704
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,647
you're about t0 experience...
the human penis.

705
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,853
Bobby, don't. I mean it!

706
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,734
Bravo, bravo!

707
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,541
Did your mother teach you
to wash your hands

708
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,797
after you go to the bathroom?

709
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,095
She taught me not to piss on my fingers.

710
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,932
- Did it feel good to get even?
- Did it feel good to lie?

711
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,186
I thought you liked the magic act.

712
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:43,144
I just didn't want to hurt your feelings.

713
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,228
I guess you can't win.

714
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:51,110
You can win by being honest with me
instead of humouring me.

715
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,659
What do we have
if we can't be honest with each other?

716
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,240
I don't know, Bobby. What do we have?

717
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,246
I don't know, Amy.

718
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,378
What else have you
been humouring me about?

719
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,750
Go to sleep.

720
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,629
No, I want to know what else
you've been sparing me from.

721
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:09,882
I'm really not in the mood for this.

722
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,840
Are you ever in the mood for anything?

723
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,722
Don't turn away from me.
I want to know what's bugging you.

724
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,644
Is it the way I eat?

725
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,725
Why did you pour
all that maple syrup on my pancakes?

726
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,435
It was a mistake, alright?

727
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,896
- Was it?
- What do you think?

728
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,903
I'm trying t0 poison you
with maple syrup?

729
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,323
If you're unhappy about something,
just tell me.

730
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,404
Don't take it out on me.

731
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:40,033
I'm really tired.

732
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,744
No, damn it! Stop avoiding this.

733
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:48,626
You've been acting like
I have the plague or something.

734
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,587
I want to know
what the hell is bothering you.

735
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,720
Is it money again?

736
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,436
Nuclear war?

737
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:06,185
What about the way we make love,
if you can remember back that far?

738
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,941
All your ooh-ing and ah-ing.

739
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,149
Is that so you just
don't hurt my feelings?

740
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,576
- Stop!
- Come on, I want to know. Tell me.

741
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,997
- Bobby, don't do this.
- Tell me, damn it!

742
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,121
Be honest for once. I can take it.

743
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:26,000
Have you been getting off too?

744
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:30,209
- You've just been humouring me.
- I really hate this kind of talk.

745
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:36,840
It's not the HP
and it's not the magic act.

746
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,810
It's just us.

747
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,226
I want the truth.

748
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,456
You wanted the truth.

749
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,580
I'm sorry.

750
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,254
You're sorry.

751
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:11,253
What do you want me to say?

752
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:23,390
Why couldn't you just tell me this before?

753
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,354
All this time
it hasn't been good for you.

754
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,232
Why did you have to lie about it?

755
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:43,039
I am your husband. Don't you think
I would care about something like that?

756
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,997
That I'd want to do something about it?

757
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:52,298
Didn't you trust me enough
to believe that?

758
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,646
I didn't say it wasn't good for me.

759
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:18,279
I just don't need the same thing
from it that you do.

760
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,445
It's never been important to me.

761
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:29,036
And you know
I feel funny talking about it.

762
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,496
Do you feel better faking it?

763
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,421
You were satisfied.

764
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,344
Satisfied?!

765
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:44,976
What do you think I am?
Some kind of machine?

766
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:47,600
That I just need a hole to cum in?

767
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:53,101
I mean, what do you think
makes me cum?

768
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,731
- Stop!
- No.

769
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,736
- What do you think makes me cum?
- I don't care!

770
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:06,911
I'll tell you. I thought it was
being inside the woman that I love.

771
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:12,542
And giving her as much pleasure
as she was giving to me.

772
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,125
You know, the two of us, together.

773
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:32,640
Some kind of magician I turned out to be.

774
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:38,146
So good, I conned myself.

775
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,654
Maybe it's time
we both stopped the conning.

776
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:50,082
Started learning again.

777
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:55,539
On our own.

778
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:06,716
I know you're pissed, but before
you go crazy, just let me explain.

779
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,894
You followed me!
I don't fucking believe this.

780
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:13,018
I just want t0 talk t0 you.
I don't to make any trouble. I promise.

781
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:16,397
- I have to go to work.
- It won't take long. Please.

782
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,896
Thank you.

783
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,994
- Well?
- It's a great apartment.

784
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,323
What are you, a real estate agent?

785
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,953
I saw these in a book once.

786
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,924
They say that in the East,
it's forbidden to have sex with someone

787
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,094
who knows your secrets,
or shortcomings.

788
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,797
You'd never be horny there.

789
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,882
I'm never horny here.

790
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,222
I guess not.

791
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,178
Cut the crap.

792
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,935
What do you want from me?

793
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,437
What makes you think
I want something?

794
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,939
Everybody wants something.

795
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,192
Why did you come here?

796
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:05,237
I wanted to see you again.

797
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,581
Look, if you think you're gonna
get back in my panties forget it.

798
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,250
There's one asshole
in there already.

799
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,498
Maybe I just want to know you.

800
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,296
I mean, I've never met anyone like you.

801
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,340
Who has?

802
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:25,261
I just thought after last week
maybe we could be friends.

803
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,714
You really think we could be friends
after last week?

804
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:31,051
Yeah, I can't think of a better way
to start a friendship.

805
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,095
We haven't met. I'm Bobby Grady.

806
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,647
Joanna Crane, I saw it on the mailbox.

807
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:40,192
What are you, about 30?
Still call yourself Bobby?

808
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,771
- I'll grow up when I'm ready.
- Oh, I think you're ready.

809
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,532
Are you alone?

810
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,076
Aren't we all?

811
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:53,247
You remind me of this hamster I had
when I was a kid.

812
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,871
- I remind you of a hamster?
- Yep.

813
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:59,170
He ran away
whenever you tried to touch him.

814
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,748
So I wanted to show him
there's nothing to be afraid of.

815
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:04,380
So one day, I just picked him
real fast and I held him.

816
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:08,759
- And he turned tender and loving?
- No, he shit in my hand.

817
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,478
Well, I'd better get going
'cause you're gonna be late for work.

818
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:19,308
It's OK. I'm used to breaking rules.
I'm a criminal at heart.

819
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,643
You meant you had one.

820
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:27,779
Thanks a lot, and I'm sorry
for busting in on you like this.

821
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:30,656
I really appreciate you listening
and I won't bother you again.

822
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,533
Oh, Bobby, if you, um...

823
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:37,496
If you ever really need me...

824
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,953
- ...t0 talk or whatever, I'm here.
- I know.

825
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:43,165
Joanna Crane.

826
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,425
Hello?

827
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:55,346
Hey, cowboy.

828
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

829
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,516
Dad, Morn said you've moved out.

830
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:08,360
Well, your mom and I,
we have to be on our own for a while.

831
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:13,195
I swear, that doesn't mean we've
stopped caring about you and Lisa.

832
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:19,626
Dad, if Mom gets married again, I don't
have to call the other guy Dad, do I?

833
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:27,501
Oh, Jimmy. No matter what happens,
I'm always gonna be your dad.

834
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,930
Why do you have to go?

835
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,638
Promise you won't be
any trouble t0 your mother.

836
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:39,311
- You watch out for your sister.
- Jimmy, come on!

837
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:42,310
- I will, don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

838
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,703
Hello, Joanna.

839
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,417
What are you doing here?
You have no right to be here.

840
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,590
I had to.

841
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,376
For both of us.

842
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,086
Get away from me.

843
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,514
I don't even want to know you.

844
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,637
No more deceptions, Joanna.

845
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:02,061
I know who you are.
We're the same, don't you see?

846
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,434
The same rage, the same fear.

847
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,982
We hurt the same,
we escape the same.

848
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:11,688
But we don't have to any more.
We have a chance. Both of us, together.

849
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:16,408
- No more disguises.
- I don't need you!

850
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,485
I'm crying out to you, for God's sake.

851
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,163
Is everything a negotiation here too?

852
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,742
- Stop it. Just shut up!
- Listen to me. Help me.

853
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,123
I'm tired of standing at street corners.

854
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:31,083
I want t0 love and care and need,
just like you do.

855
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:34,044
We can help each other.
We don't have to grow old...

856
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:37,972
It's alright. Joanna?

857
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,181
Run away. Turn on me.

858
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,598
I was only trying to save you.

859
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,935
Well... the game's not over.

860
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:55,022
The messenger of God will return.

861
01:18:55,940 --> 01:19:00,366
And this time...
he'll bring the final word.

862
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:27,698
There's Ivory soap in the shower.
It's... 99 and 44/100% pure.

863
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,323
Isn't that funny?

864
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,155
Yeah?

865
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:58,869
I don't know how to do this sort of thing.
I've been driving around for an hour.

866
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,043
Drive on, lady.

867
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,120
Please, it's not for me,
it's for my husband.

868
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,877
Just the two of you.

869
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,300
I want to buy you for an hour,
if that's what you call it.

870
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:10,380
- Is this some kind of freak trick?
- Nothing like that, I swear.

871
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,807
You know what it'll cost? I'm the
hottest piece of life on this street.

872
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,931
It'll cost you 100 bucks.
Have you got 100 bucks?!

873
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,067
I'll drive you there and bring you back.
Ten minutes on the expressway.

874
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,690
I just need someone to be with him.

875
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,658
My husband is dying.

876
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:35,700
Maybe another three months.

877
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:42,336
He's still functioning.
In fact, you'd hardly know he was sick.

878
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,839
We've been married for 28 years.

879
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:49,794
But since I found out,
I haven't been able to go near him.

880
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:54,131
He needs me so badly.
I just can't do it.

881
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:59,140
I want you t0 make him
feel like a man again.

882
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,454
His name is Ben.

883
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:31,506
My wife takes her guilt very seriously.

884
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,839
- I'm sure she told you I'm sick.
- Yes.

885
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:40,056
I didn't want her to do this.

886
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,648
I haven't been with another woman
in 28 years.

887
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:49,353
But she insisted.

888
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:53,824
Yes, ma'am. She insisted.

889
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,543
Charity really does begin at home.

890
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,585
My God, you're lovely.

891
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,925
What's your name?

892
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,627
China Blue.

893
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:16,338
I see. Image and all, eh?

894
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,385
Well... China Blue.

895
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:24,771
My body's not in the greatest shape,
as you know.

896
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:28,149
I'll try and not make
it too painful for you.

897
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:31,069
No, don't say that.

898
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,939
I want to make it good for you.

899
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,876
Oh, I want you so.

900
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:52,958
You're my master, my king.

901
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:57,338
Please let me have it. I wanna feel
that big strong man inside me.

902
01:26:57,421 --> 01:27:00,265
- Please, I want you so bad.
- Don't.

903
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,685
Alright.

904
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:08,773
Well, your wife got you the best.
I'm the best there is.

905
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:11,728
I'm gonna give you
the hottest night of your life.

906
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,114
Do you think you can raise the dead?

907
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,156
Oh no, Ben, no!

908
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,412
Don't be afraid.

909
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,869
It was only a game.

910
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:34,925
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry
you have to see me like this.

911
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,048
Don't be sorry.

912
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:39,801
You have a lot more courage
than I have.

913
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,346
At least you've stopped pretending.

914
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:49,523
Well, so long, China Blue.

915
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,903
Joanna.

916
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:58,991
Joanna.

917
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,318
<i>- Yeah'?
- It's Bobby.</i>

918
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:39,941
Look, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

919
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:43,653
Remember when you said,
"if you need me, I'm here."

920
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,287
Well, I need you.

921
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:50,246
Come on in.

922
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:55,755
God, I don't believe
that you're still working.

923
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,833
When do you sleep?

924
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,509
Valentine's Day.

925
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:03,343
- Is it your wife?
- Is it my wife?

926
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:09,014
The first time Amy and I made love,

927
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,394
she asked me if I still respected her.

928
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:16,693
Hell, I thought
that's the reason we did it.

929
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,855
Well, it's all over.

930
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:24,109
Go and sit down.
Do you want some coffee?

931
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:28,823
No, I could use a shot of morphine,
if you've got it!

932
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:33,251
I'd love to kill the last 12 years.

933
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,288
You'll survive.

934
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,840
I'm a goddamn fool.

935
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:41,043
Why did I believe so hard?

936
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,337
Now what do I have to believe in?

937
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:48,471
Bobby, come on. it really is late
and I have a lot that I have to do.

938
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,511
Don't judge me, Grady, huh?

939
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:54,269
- We both live our fantasies.
- Only mine's over!

940
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,441
And you're just still hanging around.

941
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:00,528
Come on.

942
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,698
What the hell is the point, Joanna?

943
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,616
You work so hard
at getting these people who want you

944
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:08,411
when it's not even you that they want!

945
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,113
Well, I do!

946
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:14,000
You're the one that said,
"When are you gonna grow up?"

947
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,919
Well, I think it's about time
that we both did.

948
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,464
It's so hard, Bobby.

949
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:23,965
No man's ever given me that kind
of faith before, that kind of respect.

950
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:27,464
But that hotel
is the safest place in the world.

951
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:30,642
I can do anything there,
I can be anything I can dream of

952
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:32,765
because it's not me.

953
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,437
Don't you see?

954
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,772
- I'd only end up disappointing you.
- I can chance it.

955
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,070
I'm tough.

956
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,193
- I'm not.
- Wait a second.

957
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,904
Just remember one thing.

958
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,116
We're friends.

959
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:53,449
What we did in that hotel room
we can do here.

960
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:58,082
We're the same people.
We've done as much as two people can.

961
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:00,835
Only now it'll be for each other
instead of to each other.

962
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,633
And you can't buy any higher than that.

963
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:31,929
O God, to whom vengeance belongs.

964
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:36,017
How long shall the wicked triumph?

965
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:41,356
How long shall the utterance speak
hard things?

966
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,901
How long shall they turn 50 buck tricks

967
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:48,776
and strut their evil bodies
in smelly silk underwear?

968
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:53,405
<i>Tear off that dress
and she's as helpless as I am.</i>

969
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:56,909
China Blue,

970
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,745
alias Joanna Crane.

971
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,543
Alias Peter Shayne.

972
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:07,086
They'll all be saved.

973
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,286
I have to talk to you.

974
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:38,534
What is it? Is it the kids?
What's wrong?

975
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,286
Nothing's wrong.

976
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:44,043
I wanna talk to you.

977
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:46,792
About what?

978
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:56,389
Didn't you used to have
a funny painting on that wall?

979
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:58,808
Yeah. I took it down two years ago.

980
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,806
Now what's up?

981
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:09,527
I've been doing a lot of thinking,

982
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,240
and I think I made a mistake.

983
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:19,405
I'd like us to give it another try.

984
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,329
Women! I give up.

985
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,921
What do you mean, "women"?

986
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:30,465
Who else?

987
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,669
Amy, Why?

988
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:39,549
You love me so much
you can't stand being apart,

989
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,511
or you're having trouble
getting a plumber?

990
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,849
It's hard being alone, Bobby.

991
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,686
Me in that big bed.

992
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:55,490
Last night I thought
I heard somebody trying to break in.

993
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,073
I'll rig up another alarm system.

994
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:03,490
I don't want another alarm system.

995
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:07,494
I don't want that damn hot tub. Really...

996
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,712
all I want is my husband.

997
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:20,098
And the kids really need
a mother and a father.

998
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:22,429
For what?

999
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:26,975
To watch them murder each other...

1000
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:30,692
and teach them about... hate?

1001
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,022
How about teaching them responsibility?

1002
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,491
What about letting them
learn it for themselves?

1003
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:42,746
You only learn if you're taught.

1004
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:47,417
Oh yeah?
Well, we were taught everything,

1005
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,961
and we didn't learn shit!

1006
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:53,415
I happen to think
there are some values left to believe in.

1007
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:56,092
That's great, Amy!

1008
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,922
Just keep believing. I can't anymore.

1009
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:03,053
What was so wrong
with the way we lived?

1010
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:06,727
Do you know what scared me the most
during our whole marriage?

1011
01:36:06,803 --> 01:36:08,851
Do you?

1012
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,353
It's not the mortgage.

1013
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:14,026
It's not this shop.

1014
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:16,776
It was just admitting I was scared

1015
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:20,905
and letting you and the kids down.

1016
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,622
You've met somebody, haven't you?

1017
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:32,079
Of course you have.
I can smell her all over you.

1018
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:35,673
I am so dumb!

1019
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:40,257
Who is she?

1020
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:43,010
One of those swinging singles?

1021
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:45,262
Boobs out to here.

1022
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:47,469
The morals of a bitch in heat?

1023
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,975
It may come as a shock to you,

1024
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:55,102
but sex is one hell of a way
to show what you feel.

1025
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:59,230
It's no crime to enjoy it, Amy.

1026
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:02,192
It's only a crime...

1027
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,070
when you lie about it.

1028
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:08,828
Well, I think you'd better
just get yourself out of that bed of roses

1029
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:13,332
and remember the responsibility
you have t0 your wife and your children.

1030
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:18,383
You have t0 make a very tough decision.

1031
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:24,636
I suggest you think very hard about
the things in your life that really count.

1032
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:37,603
I understand, Bobby. It's your family.
If you can't stay, you can't stay.

1033
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:41,656
I'm going t0 dinner, that's all.
It doesn't mean I'm not gonna be back.

1034
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:44,780
No matter what Amy says,
I can't go back to that life.

1035
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,907
Maybe you'd better
not come back here either.

1036
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:48,659
What's that supposed to mean?

1037
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,663
Maybe in a month or so, you'll start
feeling guilty about leaving the kids.

1038
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,666
Maybe I'll start feeling
crowded and trapped.

1039
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:59,500
Maybe you'll start resenting my past,
the time I put in on my work.

1040
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:04,088
You'll want a good meal, I can't cook.
Why don't you just go, goddamn it?!

1041
01:38:05,338 --> 01:38:08,387
You don't know what it took, Bobby.

1042
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:11,891
How long I wanted and hoped
for somebody to care for.

1043
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:14,597
- To let somebody care for me.
- I'll be back.

1044
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,900
Oh yeah, you say that. I know that.
But you're just so fucking honourable.

1045
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:23,114
Sheila told me a good one
the other day.

1046
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:28,616
She says, er,
the secretary says to the boss,

1047
01:38:28,694 --> 01:38:31,618
"So, could I use your dictaphone?"

1048
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:36,874
And he says, "No. Use your finger,
like everybody else."

1049
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,882
I made a new recipe tonight...

1050
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:54,016
It has all your favourite vegetables in it.
It looks pretty good.

1051
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:05,277
Oh, you know, listen, don't er...

1052
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:08,826
Don't forget it's Parents' Night
at Lisa's school next week.

1053
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,409
Well, I was gonna save this
until later, but...

1054
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,253
Here.

1055
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:22,502
Why don't you go on, open it?

1056
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,640
I found it in the garage.

1057
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:43,102
I bet you forgot that was still around.

1058
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:48,571
I washed it up and had to sew up
a couple of places on it...

1059
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:53,996
Put it on.

1060
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:04,628
Oh, I used to get
so turned on with you... in this.

1061
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:44,630
Bobby?

1062
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:47,838
Last rites.

1063
01:40:57,343 --> 01:41:00,893
Lovely apartment.
What do you call it, Paradise Lost?

1064
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:04,897
The Reverend's
gonna save you tonight.

1065
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:08,321
Who are you? You son of a bitch!

1066
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:11,616
Don't fight me, child. I'm the messenger
of God. I only want to heal you.

1067
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:13,910
Heal thyself, pimp shit!

1068
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:19,996
You're opposing me, Joanna.
You have to trust me.

1069
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:24,580
One more game. The final one
that will free you forever.

1070
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:27,632
Do I have your trust?

1071
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:30,711
Because we can only play
if I have your trust.

1072
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:32,921
Do I have it?

1073
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:36,633
You are out of your fucking...

1074
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:40,437
Now listen to me. I want your trust
and I'm gonna have it any way I can.

1075
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:44,732
Now, you will follow
the Reverend's orders.

1076
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:46,809
Is that clear?

1077
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:51,272
Good.

1078
01:41:51,897 --> 01:41:54,400
I believe you'll find this game unique.

1079
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:58,533
It's one you've never played before and
never will again, so make the most of it.

1080
01:41:58,613 --> 01:42:01,116
<i>It's known as 'exorcising the demons'.</i>

1081
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:03,909
In my calling,
it's the ultimate salvation.

1082
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:06,462
And its ends are sacrosanct.

1083
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:11,543
With my ecclesiastic gift,
plus the grace of God,

1084
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:14,846
and a little help from... Superman here,

1085
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:20,181
I shall bestow upon you
the supreme humanitarian blessing

1086
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:22,512
and give you your freedom.

1087
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:25,644
You, er, do want that, don't you?

1088
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:30,524
I knew you would.

1089
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:36,325
What's the game... Reverend?

1090
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,995
Sudden death. Now smile.
Smile, pig!

1091
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:42,165
<i>~ Ah!</i>

1092
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,244
- Why are you doing this?
- Why?

1093
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:49,206
My mission
has always been your salvation,

1094
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,256
but you never trusted me.

1095
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:54,962
You refused to see.
But I saw.

1096
01:42:55,044 --> 01:42:57,467
I looked at you and I saw myself.

1097
01:42:57,546 --> 01:43:00,140
I saw the same escape,
the same malignancy.

1098
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:04,517
But I know the cure and I know
how desperately you need it.

1099
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,893
And only I can give it to you.

1100
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:10,021
- I want to, Joanna.
- Why?

1101
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:13,071
Because it's my gift to you.

1102
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:16,490
Freedom.
The only thing I have left to give.

1103
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:20,411
You refused it once
but this time you have no choice.

1104
01:43:20,486 --> 01:43:24,457
Getting into the part, my love?
I know I am.

1105
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:27,752
Go fuck yourself.

1106
01:43:27,827 --> 01:43:30,125
- "Go fuck yourself?

1107
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:33,629
Not a very nice thing
to say to a man of the cloth.

1108
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:38,088
Remember, scumbag,
I'm here for your benefit. Got that?!

1109
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,848
Healthy looking plants.

1110
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:51,150
You must water them diligently.

1111
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,649
I've always preferred
plastic flowers myself.

1112
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:58,317
I could never bear
to watch the real ones die.

1113
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:01,369
But that's the trouble with living things,
I suppose.

1114
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:03,538
Inevitably they die.

1115
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,829
You've never seen anyone die,
have you?

1116
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,830
Certainly not up close.

1117
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:11,378
The swift final gasp and then...

1118
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:14,253
absolute silence.

1119
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:17,460
The stillness of the body
as the flesh turns white.

1120
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:21,548
You're terrified right now
because you think of it as death.

1121
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:24,474
But, er, think of it as...

1122
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:27,512
freedom.

1123
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,562
Forget your troubles,
come on get happy

1124
01:44:36,645 --> 01:44:41,151
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on get happy

1125
01:44:41,233 --> 01:44:44,988
You're heading for the judgment day
The sun is shinin', come on get happy

1126
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:47,243
The Lord is waitin' to take your hand

1127
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:49,792
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy

1128
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:54,168
You're heading for the promised land

1129
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:10,596
There's somebody
coming by here any minute.

1130
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:13,603
Then let's not waste any time.

1131
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:20,398
Kill me, Joanna!

1132
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:23,109
Give my life value.
Give me something to die for!

1133
01:45:23,192 --> 01:45:25,741
Save me. You are me!

1134
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,573
One of us has to die
so the other can live.

1135
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,804
Kill me, you worthless cunt.

1136
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:47,929
I'm all the men who ever hurt you,
who made you feel like shit.

1137
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:51,888
Who stole your self-respect
and turned you into China Blue. Kill me!

1138
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:54,895
Release the rage.
Get it out. Get even!

1139
01:45:56,725 --> 01:45:58,568
Too late.

1140
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:10,080
Take it out.

1141
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:16,538
China Blue lives.

1142
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,552
Strip, bitch.

1143
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:38,400
- No!
- Come on.

1144
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:40,102
- I can't.
- Joanna?

1145
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:42,438
<i>Do it, you bitch!
What are you waiting for?</i>

1146
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:44,694
Joanna?

1147
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,177
Jo, are you OK? You OK?

1148
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:22,861
No!

1149
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:54,135
Goodbye, China Blue.

1150
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:15,410
I'm here tonight...

1151
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:21,792
because I wanted
to finally start telling the truth.

1152
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:26,543
My wife and I,
we've split up for good.

1153
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:30,797
That's right. Me, the boy scout.

1154
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:36,386
I just never had the guts
to admit the truth,

1155
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:40,644
that Amy and I
had just stopped loving each other.

1156
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:44,814
There's nobody to blame.

1157
01:48:46,103 --> 01:48:48,105
That's just what happened.

1158
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:51,822
Then...

1159
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:54,699
I met this woman,

1160
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:56,955
Joanna.

1161
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,002
She saved my life.

1162
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:06,590
We're together now.

1163
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:10,802
I'm not sure if it's gonna work out.

1164
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:15,591
We don't have
a whole hell of a lot in common

1165
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:17,768
other than the fact that...

1166
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:23,144
we both need help and each other.

1167
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:32,408
The thing that scared me the most

1168
01:49:33,776 --> 01:49:35,904
during my marriage

1169
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:39,744
was just admitting that I was scared,

1170
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,376
and letting Amy down.

1171
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,174
Well, I can't pretend anymore.

1172
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:52,465
I was scared shitless
to come back here.

1173
01:49:52,544 --> 01:49:54,387
I told Joanna.

1174
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:59,351
And she took me in her arms

1175
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:03,314
and she said,

1176
01:50:03,388 --> 01:50:06,392
"it's OK to be scared."

1177
01:50:09,686 --> 01:50:12,656
I felt... stronger.

1178
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:16,318
And freer.

1179
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:22,538
And more like a man
than I've ever felt before in my life.

1180
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:28,547
Then we fucked our brains out.
