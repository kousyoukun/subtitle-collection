01:09:31,556 --> 01:09:35,458
I have to get my interview
with Russell before Greenville.

1042
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:38,087
<i>And you've got
to help me, okay?</i>

1043
01:09:38,163 --> 01:09:40,529
<i>Here's the thing about Russel.</i>

1044
01:09:40,599 --> 01:09:44,535
<i>He's my last project.
I only do this for a very few people...</i>

1045
01:09:44,603 --> 01:09:47,003
<i>and I think
we should do it together.</i>

1046
01:09:47,072 --> 01:09:50,473
<i>Because al the guys are good,
but he could be great.</i>

1047
01:09:53,545 --> 01:09:55,775
What's your real name?

1048
01:09:58,517 --> 01:10:01,418
Whoo!

1049
01:10:01,486 --> 01:10:03,647
<i>[Dick]
Al right, let's go!</i>

1050
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:06,247
[Chattering]

1051
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:11,488
Oh, it's okay.
I'm easy to forget.

1052
01:10:11,563 --> 01:10:13,531
<i>Just leave me behind!</i>

1053
01:10:13,598 --> 01:10:17,193
I'm only
the fucking lead singer!

1054
01:10:17,269 --> 01:10:19,897
Hey!

1055
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:22,132
<i>So, Ed Valencourt...</i>

1056
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,266
what do you love
about music?

1057
01:10:36,855 --> 01:10:39,824
Okay. Okay.

1058
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:42,917
<i>[Elaine] You told me you would tel me
where you were every minute.</i>

1059
01:10:42,994 --> 01:10:45,963
- You told me you would
call me twice a day.
- I know!

1060
01:10:46,031 --> 01:10:48,727
- You told me you wouldn't miss
even one test.
- I'll be home for graduation.

1061
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,768
- Mom...
- Where are you?

1062
01:10:50,836 --> 01:10:53,828
Right now, Topeka.
Then Greenville, then home.

1063
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:57,363
What about graduation?
We had an agreement, William.

1064
01:10:57,442 --> 01:10:59,376
I'm sorry I didn't
call you yesterday.

1065
01:10:59,444 --> 01:11:01,469
I guess I just miss you,
and I don't understand why...

1066
01:11:01,546 --> 01:11:03,514
I've driven my two kids
so far away from me.

1067
01:11:03,582 --> 01:11:06,517
By all practical rules,
don't I get you for another three years?

1068
01:11:08,086 --> 01:11:11,522
- Was I not fun?
- Yes.

1069
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:14,388
William!
This is Beth from Denver.

1070
01:11:14,459 --> 01:11:17,622
She's one of the legendary,
original Band Aids.

1071
01:11:17,696 --> 01:11:20,824
- She's clairvoyant!
- Oh, I can't read your mind or anything.

1072
01:11:20,899 --> 01:11:23,891
I mean, I pick up things
here and there.

1073
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:28,201
Estrella says hi.
She says I can stay in your room.

1074
01:11:28,273 --> 01:11:32,004
- Sure.
- [Beth] Great!

1075
01:11:32,077 --> 01:11:34,443
I've got some hydroponic pot!

1076
01:11:34,513 --> 01:11:38,313
- Wow, your aura is really fantastic!
- [Elaine] Hey, hey!

1077
01:11:38,383 --> 01:11:41,250
- It's this beautiful purple color.
- [Elaine] I love you.

1078
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:43,253
I missed the last thing
you said.

1079
01:11:43,321 --> 01:11:45,255
- Mom?
- [Beth] Your aura is purple!

1080
01:11:45,323 --> 01:11:47,257
- I love you.
- What?

1081
01:11:47,325 --> 01:11:49,987
- Purple, it's purple.
- [William] Mom, what?

1082
01:11:50,061 --> 01:11:54,259
- Your aura is purple.
- I miss you and I love you!

1083
01:11:54,332 --> 01:11:57,233
I love you.

1084
01:11:57,302 --> 01:11:59,497

[Chattering]

1086
01:12:26,064 --> 01:12:27,725
[Exhales]
All right.

1087
01:12:27,799 --> 01:12:30,324
Fire away. I'm ready.

1088
01:12:30,402 --> 01:12:32,836
Do you have to be depressed
to write a sad song?

1089
01:12:32,904 --> 01:12:34,838
Do you have to be in love
to write a love song?

1090
01:12:34,906 --> 01:12:38,307
Is the song better
if it really happened to you?

1091
01:12:38,376 --> 01:12:43,109
Like "Love Thing." Where did you
write that, and who is it about?

1092
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:46,651
When did you get
so professional?

1093
01:12:48,653 --> 01:12:52,646
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

1094
01:12:52,724 --> 01:12:55,716
<i>[ Band Members]
Yeah! Yea-a-ah!</i>

<i>[Sighing]</i>

1098
01:13:13,612 --> 01:13:17,480
It's the record company's
mistake, and they will pay.

1099
01:13:18,783 --> 01:13:22,219
T-shirts are gone.
Band happy, all right?

1100
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:28,715
Can we just skip the vibe and go straight
to us laughing about this?

1101
01:13:28,793 --> 01:13:32,320
<i>- Yeah, okay.
- Because I can see by your
face you want to get into it.</i>

1102
01:13:32,397 --> 01:13:35,560
How can you tell?
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.

1103
01:13:35,634 --> 01:13:38,569
[Clicks Tongue]
Here.

1104
01:13:38,637 --> 01:13:43,700
<i>Take it.
Let's take a good look at it, al right?</i>

1105
01:13:43,775 --> 01:13:46,209
See, you love this T-shirt.

1106
01:13:46,277 --> 01:13:48,404
It lets you say
everything you want to say.

1107
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:54,385
- Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.
- It's a T-shirt.

1108
01:13:55,487 --> 01:13:57,421
Do you give a shit
about a T-shirt?

1109
01:13:57,489 --> 01:14:01,255
I'm just hungry, man. Let's just go out
and find some barbecue or somethin'.

1110
01:14:01,326 --> 01:14:04,853
- I'm always gonna tell you the truth.
- Are you doing coke again?

1111
01:14:04,929 --> 01:14:07,420
Oh, yeah!
All the time!

1112
01:14:07,499 --> 01:14:10,525
<i>This is big stuff, man.</i>

1113
01:14:10,602 --> 01:14:13,093
<i>From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...</i>

1114
01:14:13,171 --> 01:14:15,833
and you're
the guitarist with mystique.

1115
01:14:15,907 --> 01:14:17,932
That's the dynamic
we agreed on.

1116

<i>Page, Plant.
Mick, Keith.</i>

Blackmore, Gillan.

<i>But somehow it's al
turning around.</i>

1119
01:14:26,484 --> 01:14:29,044
We have got to control
what's happening!

1120
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,419
<i>- There's a responsibility here.
- [Russel] Excuse me...</i>

1121
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:36,085
<i>but didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?</i>

1122
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:38,095
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

1123
01:14:38,163 --> 01:14:41,564
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You can
trust him. Say what you want.</i>

01:14:41,633 --> 01:14:43,567
<i>He won't write it.</i>

1125
01:14:43,635 --> 01:14:48,231
Look, I work as hard,
or harder, than anybody on that stage.

1126
01:14:48,306 --> 01:14:52,003
<i>You know what I do?
I connect.</i>

1127
01:14:52,077 --> 01:14:54,045
I get people off!

<i>Actually, that you can print!</i>

1131
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:05,612
And yet, why do I
always end up feeling...

1132
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:07,658
like I'm a joke to you?

1133
01:15:07,726 --> 01:15:11,184
<i>Look, you want to pretend
this isn't gonna be a very big band?</i>

1134
01:15:11,262 --> 01:15:14,891
<i>Wel, it is!
You cal yourself a leader of this band...</i>

1135
01:15:14,966 --> 01:15:17,662
<i>but your direction
alowed this T-shirt...</i>

1136
01:15:17,736 --> 01:15:19,931
when you allowed Dick
to manage us.

1137

<i>'Cause he's your friend!</i>

1138
01:15:23,308 --> 01:15:26,072
Don't you see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

1139
01:15:26,144 --> 01:15:29,341
All right, is it my turn now?
Because I think we should, for once...

1140
01:15:29,414 --> 01:15:32,747
<i>- say what we really mean.
- Oh, this is the part where you quit!</i>

- Deal with it.

1142
01:15:36,488 --> 01:15:39,184
- And let me just say what
nobody else wants to say...
- [Screaming] What?

1143
01:15:39,257 --> 01:15:42,351
Your looks have
become a problem.

<i>- [Dick] Al right, okay. Enough!

Come on, man. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

Let's go find
something real.

1150

From here on out, I'm only interested
in what is real... real people, real feelings.

1151
01:16:13,424 --> 01:16:16,689
That's it. That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

Tell me,
what's your family like?

1156
01:16:33,578 --> 01:16:36,012
My dad died
of a heart attack...

1157
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:41,575
and my sister believes that my mom is so
intense that she had to escape our family.

1158
01:16:41,653 --> 01:16:43,553
They can't seem to find a way
to get through it.

1159
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:45,589
I mean, they don't even
speak to each other anymore.

<i>Plus, she gave me al her albums,

02:11:05,916 --> 02:11:09,317
<i>- It appears we've caught the
edge of that electrical storm.
- Oh, my God.</i>

1915
02:11:09,386 --> 02:11:11,684
<i>- Electrical storm?
- Buckle up tight.
We're gonna get you out of this.</i>

1916
02:11:11,755 --> 02:11:15,054
<i>- Rock 'n' roll.
- [Jeff ] We shouldn't be here.</i>

1917
02:11:15,126 --> 02:11:20,029
<i>- [ Thunderclap ]
- Whoa, baby!</i>

1918
02:11:20,097 --> 02:11:24,158
<i>[ Russel Whooping ]
Doris, we miss you!</i>

1919
02:11:26,937 --> 02:11:30,100
Listen, we're gonna
try and land in Tupelo.

1920
02:11:30,174 --> 02:11:34,577
<i>- We found a field to land in.
- A field?</i>

1921
02:11:34,645 --> 02:11:37,671
It's gonna be kind of a rough set down,
but we should be fine.

1922
02:11:37,748 --> 02:11:40,774
<i>just hang in there,
and we'l get you out of this.</i>

1923

<i>[ Thunderclap ]</i>

1924
02:11:46,757 --> 02:11:51,490
- Everyone says,
''It's so glamorous out here.''
- He just told us we're gonna die.

1925
02:11:51,562 --> 02:11:55,191
<i>- [ Buzzers Blaring ]
- I'm trying to maintain,

1926

<i>- [ Thunderclap ]

1927
02:11:58,369 --> 02:12:00,667
<i>[ Engines Straining ]</i>

1928
02:12:00,738 --> 02:12:03,832
If something should happen...

1929
02:12:03,908 --> 02:12:06,433
maybe I never said this enough:

1930
02:12:06,510 --> 02:12:09,843
I love all of you.

1931
02:12:09,914 --> 02:12:12,747
<i>[ Engines Whining ]</i>

1932
02:12:12,816 --> 02:12:14,909
<i>[ Thunderclap ]</i>

1933
02:12:14,985 --> 02:12:18,921
I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
A hit-and-run.

1934
02:12:18,989 --> 02:12:22,356
I hit him
and just kept on going.

1935
02:12:22,426 --> 02:12:25,589
I don't know if he's alive
or dead, but I'm sorry.

1936
02:12:25,663 --> 02:12:31,363
<i>- Not a day goes by
that I don't see his face.
- [ Leslie ] Oh, my God!</i>

1937
02:12:31,435 --> 02:12:36,372
<i>Look, I love you al too. You're like family
to me. Especialy since Marna left me.</i>

1938
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:42,106
And if I took an extra dollar or two here
and there, it's because I knew I earned it.

1939
02:12:42,179 --> 02:12:44,807
Yeah. I slept with Marna, Dick.

1940
02:12:44,882 --> 02:12:47,783
I did too.

1941
02:12:47,851 --> 02:12:51,878
I waited until you broke up with her,
Dick, but me too.

1942
02:12:51,956 --> 02:12:55,323
I also slept with Leslie
when you were fighting.

1943
02:12:55,392 --> 02:12:58,088
You slept with Jeff?

1944
02:12:58,162 --> 02:13:01,825
Yeah, but it didn't count. It was the
summer we decided to be free of all rules.

1945
02:13:01,899 --> 02:13:06,700
<i>- And you say you love me!
- I don't love you, man. I never did.</i>

1946
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:09,000
<i>None of us love you.</i>

1947
02:13:09,073 --> 02:13:13,476
<i>- You act above us,you always have.
- [ Larry ] Finaly, the truth.</i>

1948
02:13:13,544 --> 02:13:18,174
<i>You just held it over us like you might
leave, like we're lucky to be with you.</i>

1949
02:13:18,249 --> 02:13:20,444
<i>And we had to live with it, man.</i>

1950
02:13:20,517 --> 02:13:24,385
<i>I had to live with you,
and now I might die with you...</i>

1951
02:13:24,455 --> 02:13:27,788
- and it's not fucking fair!
- Please, enough!

1952
02:13:31,161 --> 02:13:33,721
And I'm still
in love with you, Leslie.

1953
02:13:33,797 --> 02:13:36,664
Oh, I don't want to hear any more!
Shut up,Jeffrey!

1954
02:13:36,734 --> 02:13:38,759
-Jeffrey?
- It's all happening.

1955
02:13:38,836 --> 02:13:41,361
<i>Whatever happens, Bebe,
you're dead!</i>

1956
02:13:41,438 --> 02:13:44,965
Don't be self-righteous,
Russell, not now, man.

1957
02:13:45,042 --> 02:13:48,409
You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie!

1958
02:13:48,479 --> 02:13:51,937
<i>Last summer up until yesterday.
Why don't you tel Leslie that?</i>

1959
02:13:52,016 --> 02:13:54,041

1960
02:13:54,118 --> 02:13:56,416
<i>- [ Russel ] I'm gonna kil you!
- [ Dennis ] I quit!</i>

1961
02:13:56,487 --> 02:14:00,321
<i>''That groupie''?
She was a Band Aid.</i>

1962
02:14:00,391 --> 02:14:02,689
All she did was love your band.

1963
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:08,198
<i>And you al used her, al of you.
You used her and threw her away.</i>

1964
02:14:08,265 --> 02:14:12,429
<i>She almost died last night
while you were with Bob Dylan!</i>

1965
02:14:12,503 --> 02:14:16,371
You guys are always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

1966
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:20,706
She was your biggest fan
and you threw her away.

1967
02:14:20,778 --> 02:14:25,340
<i>And if you can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.</i>

1968
02:14:25,416 --> 02:14:27,884
And I love her!
I love her!

<i>Just leave your package

Oh, I'm not a messenger.
I'm one of your writers.

1979
02:16:57,501 --> 02:16:59,662
William H. Miller.

1980
02:17:06,443 --> 02:17:08,434
<i>[ Whispering ]
He's just a kid!</i>

1981

Go right on in.

1982
02:17:38,141 --> 02:17:40,234
You're William Miller?

1983
02:17:41,979 --> 02:17:44,948
- Yep.
- Oh, baby.

1984
02:17:47,017 --> 02:17:50,453
<i>Didn't anything happen,
I mean, after $600 in room service bills?</i>

1985
02:17:50,521 --> 02:17:53,012
Didn't you get anything
on tape with Russell Hammond?

1986
02:17:53,090 --> 02:17:55,388
Where are you in this piece?
What did you want to write?

1987
02:17:55,459 --> 02:17:57,689
This reads like what
they wanted you to write.

1988
02:17:57,761 --> 02:17:59,592
You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

1989
02:17:59,663 --> 02:18:02,291
I think we should push up
Flippo's Who cover.

1990
02:18:02,366 --> 02:18:05,267
Good, 'cause it's gonna take me
three days to get through this research.

1991
02:18:05,335 --> 02:18:08,930
<i>It's al handwritten
on little bits of paper!</i>

1992
02:18:09,006 --> 02:18:11,804
<i>- It's a puff-piece.
- Plus, they refer
to al the women as chicks.</i>

1993
02:18:11,875 --> 02:18:15,106
- I have a problem with that.
- You want them to like you. It happens.

1994
02:18:15,178 --> 02:18:19,444
Ben, you told me
to send what I had.

1995
02:18:19,516 --> 02:18:22,917
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

1996
02:18:57,287 --> 02:19:01,519
<i>[ Lester ] Oh, man.
So you made friends with them?</i>

1997
02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:06,054
See, friendship
is the booze they feed you.

1998
02:19:06,129 --> 02:19:09,565
They want you to get drunk
on feeling like you belong.

1999
02:19:09,633 --> 02:19:12,067
Well, it was fun.

2000
02:19:12,135 --> 02:19:15,229
Because they
make you feel cool.

2001
02:19:15,305 --> 02:19:20,333
- And, hey, I met you. You are not cool.
- I know.

2002
02:19:20,410 --> 02:19:23,777
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

2003
02:19:23,847 --> 02:19:27,078
Because we are uncool.

2004
02:19:27,150 --> 02:19:30,916
Women will always be
a problem for guys like us.

2005
02:19:30,988 --> 02:19:35,254
Most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem.

2006
02:19:35,325 --> 02:19:39,261
Good-looking people,
they got no spine.

2007
02:19:39,329 --> 02:19:42,264
Their art never lasts.

2008
02:19:42,332 --> 02:19:44,596
And they get the girls,
but we're smarter.

2009
02:19:46,503 --> 02:19:48,767
Yeah, I can
really see that now.

2010
02:19:48,839 --> 02:19:53,936
Because great art is about
the guilt and longing...

2011
02:19:54,011 --> 02:19:57,879
and love disguised as sex
and sex disguised as love.

2012
02:19:57,948 --> 02:20:01,748
Hey, let's face it,
you got a big head start.

2013
02:20:01,818 --> 02:20:03,752
I'm glad you were home.

2014
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:06,721
I'm always home.
I'm uncool.

2015
02:20:06,790 --> 02:20:10,055
- Me too.
- You're doing great, man.

2016
02:20:10,127 --> 02:20:12,789
The only true currency
in this bankrupt world...

2017
02:20:12,863 --> 02:20:16,492
is what you share with someone else
when you're uncool.

2018
02:20:17,701 --> 02:20:19,794
Listen, my advice to you...

2019
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:23,271
and I know you think
these guys are your friends...

2020
02:20:23,340 --> 02:20:27,800
if you want to be a true
friend to them, be honest...

2021
02:20:27,878 --> 02:20:31,006
and unmerciful.

2022
02:20:31,081 --> 02:20:36,314
''I'm flying high over Tupelo, Mississippi,

[ Larry ]
They called me too. What's he using?

2029
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:00,703
All, he's using it all.
This, according to the ''fact checker.''

2030
02:21:00,777 --> 02:21:03,803
- So what?
- ''So what''?

2031
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:05,814
We come off like amateurs--

2032
02:21:05,882 --> 02:21:10,148
some average band trying
to come to grips with success...

2033
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:12,984
jealous and fighting
and breaking up.

2034
02:21:13,056 --> 02:21:14,990
We're buffoons!

2035
02:21:15,058 --> 02:21:19,495
''Rock 'n' roll can save the world''?
''The chicks are great''?

2036
02:21:19,563 --> 02:21:21,497
I sound like a dick!

2037
02:21:21,565 --> 02:21:24,125
- [ Muttering ] You are a dick.
- I never said that!

2038
02:21:24,201 --> 02:21:26,499
Maybe we don't see ourselves
the way we really are.

2039
02:21:26,570 --> 02:21:30,802
Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

2040
02:21:30,874 --> 02:21:35,174
This kid has you on acid screaming,
''I'm a golden god,'' from a fan's rooftop.

2041
02:21:35,245 --> 02:21:38,942
They used him to fuck us.
They'll probably just put you on the cover.

2042
02:21:39,015 --> 02:21:41,449
Wait. I never said,
''I'm a golden god.''

2043
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:45,486
Or did I?

2044
02:21:45,555 --> 02:21:48,524
We never took him seriously.
Now it's serious.

2045
02:21:48,592 --> 02:21:50,856
I liked him as a person.

2046
02:21:50,927 --> 02:21:54,488
He was never a person.
He was a journalist!

2047
02:21:54,564 --> 02:21:58,796
You! You had
the right idea all along!

2048

Don't worry.
It's unspecific who says what.

2050
02:22:04,608 --> 02:22:07,202
<i>No names are mentioned

I told him he could write
what he wanted.

2053
02:22:18,021 --> 02:22:20,512
Hey, they haven't talked
to Russell yet.

2054
02:22:20,590 --> 02:22:23,650
You can always deny
the key stuff to the fact checker.

2055
02:22:23,727 --> 02:22:26,992
- One phone call. Then they can't print it.
- Is that true?

2056
