2
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,783
You know, sometimes it seems like
life is all planned out.

3
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,828
There's no choice in the matter,

4
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,427
We're all gonna end up in the same place,
whether we like it or not.

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,980
But sometimes things aren't so simple,

6
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,271
You can end up hurting the people
you love the most,

7
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,146
betraying the people
you want to come throughfor,

8
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,142
That's not me,That's my best friend, Steve,

9
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,710
We've been best friends since third grade,

10
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,069
when he punched this kid, Billy Utsch,
for slamming a locker door on my head.

11
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,826
That's me,
I'm Darren Shan, and this is my story,

12
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,663
Oh, and, trust me,
spending this much time in a coffin

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,902
was never part of my plan,

14
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,266
Guess I'm just lucky,

15
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:16,384
Up until recently,
my life was pretty good.

16
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,502
I was popular enough,

17
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,028
I got good grades,
'cause my allowance was tied to it.

18
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,629
-A's! I Iove you. I Iove you.
-Yeah, that's the boy. That's the boy.

19
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,224
-Hey, you.
What's up, D?

20
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:33,142
And I had some coolfriends,

21
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,823
Hey, what's up?

22
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,987
Uh, not including that dude,

23
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:41,303
I mean, we were friends infifth grade,
but he'd become kind of a freak.

24
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,547
See, that used to matter to me,

25
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:48,628
There was one thing in my life
that was a bit insane, onefriend.

26
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,303
-Hey.
-My bestfriend.

27
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:52,222
-Let's cut, all right?
-What?

28
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,188
No, we're here. CIass is starting, man.

29
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,784
AII right, folks.

30
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,070
What you got for me?

31
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,710
Okay, Iisten,
I cannot deal with that jerk today.

32
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:06,819
AII right, Mr Perfect, come on, take a risk.
Take a risk. Come on!

33
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,060
So, hey, I'm thinking about moving
to Mexico. You want to go?

34
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,420
Yeah, sure. Why not?

35
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,501
Yeah, you're not going anywhere,
Mr Perfect.

36
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,264
Oh, shit.

37
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:27,546
Hey, man, I bet you can't hit that Iight
from all the way back here.

38
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,666
What? No, we're gonna get busted.

39
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,503
"Steve, we're gonna get busted."

40
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,788
-Hey!
-Rock. Come on.

41
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:43,590
And so the Mutually Assured
Destruction policy of the Cold War...

42
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,668
...was just that. Mad.

43
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,543
What the heck is that?

44
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:56,380
I'm so sorry.

45
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,383
It's that Steve. It's that damn Steve.

46
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,585
Uh...

47
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,230
Did Darren tell you he got an A
on his math test?

48
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:05,745
Yes, he did, honey. Go to your room.

49
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,550
You are not going to be friends
with that Steve any more!

50
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,223
Mom, I'm not five years old.

51
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:12,427
You can't tell me who I can
and can't be friends with.

52
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,342
You are on a good path, Darren,

53
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,786
and that Steve is knocking you
right off that path.

54
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:21,308
-What path?
-The path to a happy, productive Iife.

55
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:26,108
To a good college, a great job
and a family of your own.

56
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:30,821
A happy, productive Iife.
College, job, family!

57
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,628
College, job, family!

58
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,861
And one day, if you're really Iucky,

59
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,590
you'II be standing here
yelling at a teenager of your own!

60
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,821
College, job,family!

61
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,950
College, job,family!

62
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,423
College, job, family! It's not that hard!

63
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,269
Darren, are you Iistening?

64
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:51,339
So, wait. You...

65
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,866
What, you told your parents you're not
gonna be friends with me any more?

66
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,710
Yeah, but, I mean, it doesn't mean anything.

67
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,020
We're still Iike best friends.

68
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,625
Okay, Iike what, secret best friends?

69
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:06,263
Yeah, kind of.

70
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,829
I mean, no, it's Iike...

71
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,903
-Look, I don't care what they say.
-Bullshit.

72
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,710
You do care what they say.
You do whatever they say.

73
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,190
That's just who you are.

74
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,069
You never stand up for yourself
or anybody else.

75
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,506
Maybe your parents are right.

76
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:24,304
Maybe you shouldn't be friends with me.
I'm nothing. I'm garbage.

77
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,188
You're not garbage.

78
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,229
You're my friend. You're my best friend.

79
00:07:58,138 --> 00:07:59,583
Whoa!

80
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:03,379
"Cirque du Freak. One night only.
The world's greatest freak show.

81
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,028
"Five hundred years." What the heck?

82
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:06,463
Dude, that Iooks awesome.

83
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:09,781
I can't go, though.
I'm grounded for two months.

84
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,829
Right. And we're also not friends any more.

85
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:17,783
What's this?

86
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,509
A freak show? This is illegal.

87
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:24,545
I hope you weren't thinking
of attending this.

88
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:29,789
Because the idea of taking
a group of disgusting,

89
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:35,308
weird, deformed people and exploiting them
for money,,, Not in our town,

90
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:40,303
I'm assuming no one in this class
would actually go to this.

91
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,742
Hey. You know that means something
when the moon Iooks Iike that.

92
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,223
-I read about it...
-In one of your vampire books?

93
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:17,139
I shouldexplain,

94
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:20,062
Steve was obsessed with vampires,

95
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:23,426
andl, on the other hand,
was obsessed with spiders,

96
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:27,624
I don't know why, It was just like
it was in our blood or something,

97
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:32,427
"Back in three seconds"?

98
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:36,387
One, two, three. It's been three seconds.

99
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:41,779
Uh...

100
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:43,778
Okay.

101
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:46,107
I guess they want money.

102
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,944
Hey, I need two tickets, please.

103
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:56,738
Hey! Hey!

104
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,627
Hey, come on.
I gave you the money, give me the ticket.

105
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:01,899
Ow! Whoa!

106
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:04,902
-Holy crap!
-God, what was that?

107
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,309
Hey, come on!

108
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:11,984
And it's gone.

109
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,462
-You okay?
-Yeah.

110
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:20,224
Hello?

111
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:29,021
Are you boys 21 ?

112
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,586
Are you 21 ?

113
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:34,938
Say yes.

114
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:38,705
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

115
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:42,624
Good. You don't have
a tendency towards panic,

116
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:48,065
sudden cardiac arrest or crippling anxiety,
do you?

117
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:50,738
Say no.

118
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:54,019
-No.
-No.

119
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,787
AII right, then.

120
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,821
Go ahead in. Show is about to start.

121
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,663
Welcome.

122
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:29,139
Welcome to the Cirque du Freak,

freak show in the Western hemisphere.

124
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:35,747
We have toured for 500 years,

125
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:39,584
bringing the bizarre
to generation after generation.

126
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:43,261
May I present the Wolfman!

127
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:55,421
No sudden noises.

128
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:04,818
Dude, he totally just scratched his balls.

129
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:19,225
No!

130
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:25,668
-Call an ambulance!
-It's okay. That's not necessary.

131
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,943
Good boy.

132
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:33,459
And stay.

133
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,467
Ladies and gentlemen,

Come on. That is so rude.

144

So, I'm Evra Von Britow,

00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:21,018
Who's "we"?

148
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:24,897
There'II be some CDs for sale in the Iobby
immediately following the show.

149
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,741
Bippo! No!

150
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:35,941
Bippo, drop it, spit that out!

151
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:38,497
Yes, I'm glad you're all enjoying
this so much. It's awesome.

152
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,057
Evra, please be professional.

153
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,182
It's not my fault. I just want to play music.

154
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:46,544
-We'II discuss it Iater.
-But...

155
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,547
And now,

156
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:52,266
the voluptuous, the exotic,

157
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:57,023
the insightful Madame Truska!

158
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:08,818
Do we have someone brave enough
to be my assistant?

159
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:10,428
- Over here.
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:12,261
Come on. Come on.

161
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:14,218
You.

162
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,907
Who are you?

163
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:48,225
My name is Fred Smith. I'm from out of town.

164
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:09,666
Larten, finish your act quickly,
and Iet's Ieave this town early.

165
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:11,466
What? I have someone here tonight.

166
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:13,747
Ready for more?

167
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:16,741
Larten Crepsley and Madam Octa!

168
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,261
Don't go on. I have a foreboding.

169
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:23,341
You always have a foreboding, beautiful.

170
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,987
Larten!

171
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:32,458
Thank you, Iadies and gentlemen.

172
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,824
I am so excited to be here
in anonymous small town

173
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:37,025
which used to have character
but is now just a bland suburb

174
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,498
filled with chain stores
and surrounded by slums.

175
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:41,386
It really is a pleasure to be here.

176
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:42,697
And I am so honoured that

177
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:46,543
blah, blah, blah and so on and so forth,
et cetera, ad nauseum.

178
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,341
I'm afraid I have some
unfortunate news, however.

179
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:54,422
I had hoped to present my usual act,
but my spider, Madam Octa,

180
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:57,865
seems to have escaped from her cage
and is currently missing.

181
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,744
Use caution when retrieving your belongings
from beneath your seats.

182
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:04,468
She is very poisonous.

183
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:05,868
But not to worry.

184
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:10,784
Tonight I will perform for you
some startling illusions.

185
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,343
First, a rabbit from a hat.

186
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:21,741
This is Madam Octa.

187
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:27,222
Interesting fact, one bite
from this spider means certain death.

188
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:31,064
But don't worry. As Iong as I stay calm...

189
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:32,702
She's beautiful.

190
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:35,947
If I could just get my flute, that usually...

191
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:19,578
Darren. His name's not Larten Crepsley.
It's Vur Horsten. He's a vampire.

192
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:23,337
I saw his painting
in one of my vampire books.

193
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,658
It's him. He's got the same scars,

194
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,819
the same hair, the same everything.

195
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,818
-You seriously think he's a vampire?
-Yeah.

196
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:54,622
May I have my spider back, please?

197
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,021
Now, boys, vampires don't exist,

198
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:04,578
but if one did
and he thought someone knew,

199
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,897
he might smother them in their sleep.

200
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:11,177
That's it! Show's over!

201
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:13,465
-It's Mr Kersey.
-Come on, Iet's go.

202
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:17,336
By order of the Health Inspector,
this theatre is shut down!

203
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,145
Good Lord, not again.

204
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:23,063
Welcome to the Cirque.
What seems to be the problem?

205
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:25,537
We don't want you filthy people here.

206
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:26,823
That's not the problem.

207
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:31,697
The problem is you are exploiting
these poor people for profit.

208
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:36,020
Thank you.
Thank you so much for Iooking out for us.

209
00:19:36,096 --> 00:19:39,657
So you gonna Iet us move in with you?
Give us jobs?

210
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:43,461
-Freak!
So clumsy.

211
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:47,946
-I felt Iike a manatee. It felt terrible.
No.

212
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,387
Octa.

213
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:02,546
Anyone here?

214
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:06,462
Whoa.

215
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:36,266
Hey, Octa. I'm Darren. I'm a big fan.

216
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,743
We can speak in private. It's the only...

217
00:20:56,616 --> 00:20:59,859
We can talk in private.
The police have Ieft now.

218
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:02,337
So, this is what you've been doing
with your Iife.

219
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,418
You didn't Iike the act.
- I'm insane. I'm insane. I'm insane.

220
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,147
Well, I saw the spider bit coming.

221
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:09,456
Everybody's a critic.

222
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,983
It's not easy
to hold an audience's attention these days.

223
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:17,065
-To us and Charna's Guts.
-To us and Charna's Guts.

224
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:21,578
Did you see that fingernail moon tonight?

225
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,704
The first one in 50 years.

226
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:27,024
Yes. I noticed it.

227
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:31,219
Look, Vincent's dead.

228
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:34,497
Murdered. Sucked dry by one of them,

229
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,980
They're after us, man. They're after us.
They're after us!

230
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,945
Those damn Vampaneze!
They're gonna pick us off.

231
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,984
First Vincent, then you, then me.

232
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:45,740
Why me before you?

233
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:48,979
Well, because I'm the toughest,
and they'II save me for Iast.

234
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:50,899
Oh. Of course, I forgot.

235
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:52,902
Well, what about the Vampire Council?

236
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:54,626
They must have something to say
about Vincent.

237
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:58,667
Yes. They say good riddance.
They're a bunch of wimps now, Larten.

238
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:01,546
They'II do anything
to avoid a war with the Vampaneze.

239
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:06,144
There are no real generals Ieft, hombre,
You and I were the Iast of the Mo-Freakins!

240
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:08,696
And to top it off, Tiny's back.

241
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:12,821
Mr Tiny? Back from the other side?

242
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:16,821
Yes! Just Iast week
he was at the Council Library,

243
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:20,696
messing with the Book of Souls,
He's trying to destroy us all!

244
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:23,700
Megalomaniac!That man's a megalomaniac!

245
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:39,222
And those murderous, scumbag Vampaneze,

246
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:42,540
they're up to something, too,
and it's all connected.

247
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:44,744
It's all connected. I can feel it!

248
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:48,025
Come with me. We can avenge old Vincent.

249
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:50,901
-Kill us some Vampaneze!
-No. I'm sorry.

250
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:52,819
No? Why?

251
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:55,901
I'm done fighting.

252
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:59,423
I Ieft that Iife for a reason.
I'm just a vaudevillian.

253
00:22:59,496 --> 00:23:01,624
It's a simple Iife, and I Iike it.

254
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,263
Steve.

255
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:08,341
I know who you are.
I know what you are, Vur Horsten.

256
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:14,066
Who sent you? The Apocalypse Monger?
The BIood Barons?

257
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:16,184
No... No one. I... No one sent me. I just...

258
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:18,577
I have these vampire books,
and I saw a painting of him

259
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:20,420
with some girl in, Iike, 1819.

260
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:23,943
It said that she broke up with him
when she found he was a vampire.

261
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:26,422
Did you hear that, Gavner?

262
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:29,386
Missy broke up with me
because I was a vampire.

263
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:32,585
Funny, I always thought
it was the only thing she Iiked about me.

264
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,658
Let the kid go. Let him go.

265
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:38,742
Now, are you mentally unfit?

266
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,266
Didn't you hear me threaten you
at the show?

267
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,543
I did. It was awesome.

268
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:50,622
You see, I want this.
I want you to make me into a vampire.

269
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:54,740
I mean, vampires,
they don't take crap from anybody.

270
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,466
They Iive by their own set of rules.

271
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:59,505
It's true they do have their own rules.
We wrote some of them.

272
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:03,546
Yes, and one of them
is children can't become vampires.

273
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:04,662
Look, Iook, blood.

274
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:07,101
BIood.

275
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,545
You see, Gavner, blood.

276
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:15,821
Look, if you become a vampire,

277
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:18,739
you have to Ieave your friends
and your family.

278
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:21,466
It's deeply depressing. Trust me.

279
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:24,464
Now get out of here.

280
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:31,262
I haven't seen my dad in years.

281
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:35,457
My mom is drunk all the time.

282
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:38,783
I absolutely hate my Iife.

283
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:43,898
I never actually said it before,
but it's the truth.

284
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,739
This is what I was meant for.

285
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:51,859
What you're meant for?

286
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:56,296
Well, if that's the case, Iet's test your blood.

287
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,536
No. No.

288
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,737
Who sent you here?
Your blood tastes of evil.

289
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:11,737
You can never be a vampire.

290
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:14,661
What?

291
00:25:14,735 --> 00:25:16,737
I have what, bad blood?

292
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,303
I'm never gonna forget this.

293
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:24,026
One day, I promise you,
I will hunt you down.

294
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:25,301
And what?

295
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,581
Kill me?

296
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:33,546
Do you know how easily I could kill you?
I could do it tonight.

297
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:37,298
I could knock you out
and Iay you in front of a bus,

298
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,581
and no one would ever know!

299
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:43,058
Calm down. Save that stuff for the enemy.
He's just an idiot kid,

300
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:45,741
who should be Ieaving right now

301
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:48,260
while he still can.

302
00:25:53,695 --> 00:25:55,504
You're out there, man.

303
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,656
AII right. One for the road.

304
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:03,104
I'm headed back to the Mountain

305
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:07,499
to try to convince those old cowards
to stand up against the Vampaneze.

306
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:12,137
Gavner, if we kill one of them, it means war.

307
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:15,738
Wouldn't that be a shame?

308
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:21,585
Poor old Vincent.

309
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:25,661
You've been awfully quiet under there.

310
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:49,216
Get in.

311
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:14,621
Thanks. Thanks, I really needed a ride.

312
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,820
Oh, absolutely, absolutely delighted.

313
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:23,462
Are you the one known as Steve?

314
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:29,139
No, I'm the one known as Darren.

315
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,456
I actually had a bike.

316
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:34,823
But I'II just get it tomorrow in the daylight.

317
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:38,305
No need. It's in the trunk.

318
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:42,541
Now, if I may ask, Darren,

319
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:48,542
do you believe in the immutability
of the human soul?

320
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:51,616
The what?

321
00:27:51,695 --> 00:27:54,699
So, he knows nothing of souls, does he?

322
00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:58,101
Knows only of blood, huh?

323
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:02,180
The pulsing, the delicious, the ruby red.

324
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:12,815
Wow, wow, you know what?
You can just Iet me off right here.

325
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:14,859
What's the rush?

326
00:28:14,935 --> 00:28:19,463
After all, didn't we save you from the scary,
scary vampire?

327
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:26,056
Doesn't act Iike Ieadership material.

328
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:30,743
Acts more Iike a bag of blood.
Are you? Huh? Bag of blood?

329
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:35,537
Shows how much you know, Murlaugh.
I think he reeks of potential.

330
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:38,064
-Ow!
-Sorry.

331
00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:40,701
Souvenir.

332
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:49,578
We all have a destiny, Darren.

333
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:53,216
And with a few simple tests,
we can find out what yours is.

334
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,537
Wonderful to meet you, Darren.

335
00:28:58,255 --> 00:29:01,145
It's Iike Iooking in a mirror.

336
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:12,776
Darren!

337
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:15,379
We'II be in touch.

338
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:37,344
Freaky dream. Freaky. Freaky.

339
00:29:43,454 --> 00:29:46,424
Hey. Hey, I'm gonna try
to get you some food, okay?

340
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:50,180
Just hold on one sec. I'm gonna go
get some flies from the window sill, okay?

341
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:52,825
Hey. Why have you been acting so weird?

342
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,134
I'm not acting weird.

343
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:58,262
-You were just talking to your backpack.
-What?

344
00:29:58,334 --> 00:29:59,984
-No, I wasn't.
-Darren, yes, you were.

345
00:30:00,054 --> 00:30:01,704
-I wasn't.
-Let me... Just Iet me see it a second.

346
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:03,458
-You see? It's just my backpack.
-Seriously, stop it.

347
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:07,141
-Hey, give me my backpack, man.
-Hey, just Iet me see it.

348
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:10,062
Holy shit! That's... That's the...

349
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:13,377
Yeah, I went back to the theatre
after the show and I kind of borrowed it.

350
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:15,058
You stole from a vampire?

351
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:16,704
-Do you realise you're a dead man?
-Shh!

352
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,862
-You're a dead man!
-He's never gonna find me.

353
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:20,345
Okay, just...

354
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:24,775
Wait a second.
When did you go to Vur Horsten's room,

355
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:26,583
and what did you see?

356
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:31,498
AII right, I saw everything.

357
00:30:31,574 --> 00:30:34,145
Steve, are you crazy?
Why would you want to become a vampire?

358
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:37,935
Listen, you can't understand.
You have everything.

359
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:41,624
What do I have? A secret best friend?

360
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:47,220
Hey, Ieave it in there, okay?

361
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:48,659
-It's fine.
-I want to see it.

362
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:54,059
Be careful. Hey, be careful, okay?
Be really careful.

363
00:30:57,534 --> 00:31:00,299
This thing's even more hideous close up.

364
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:01,535
Can you just put it back now, please?

365
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:17,458
Okay, I need the pipe.

366
00:31:18,974 --> 00:31:20,976
I got a B-minus in history.

367
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:23,021
No!

368
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:27,698
Oh, my gosh, what is that?

369
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:43,101
-Move!
Steve! Wait!

370
00:31:44,374 --> 00:31:45,455
What's going on?

371
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,695
Move! Get out of the way, idiots!

372
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:04,778
Watch out! Move!

373
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:07,458
Hey! Steve, don't!

374
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,941
Now I got you! Hold still!

375
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:16,343
What's the matter with you?
Whose side are you on?

376
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,941
Hey! No! Hey!

377
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,621
Guys, Iook, it's in his shirt!

378
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:44,015
-Get it off me!
Oh, my God!

379
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:25,782
So what have you come
to steal from me this time? Thief!

380
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,302
Nothing. Nothing.

381
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:33,175
Look, Octa bit my best friend, Steve,
and he's in the hospital,

382
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:35,303
in a coma, because of me.

383
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:38,378
And I was wondering if you had an antidote.

384
00:33:38,454 --> 00:33:40,900
-I do.
-Thank you.

385
00:33:40,974 --> 00:33:43,420
But I only have a couple doses Ieft.

386
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:46,862
Why should I waste any
on some Iittle psychopath?

387
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,982
PIease, I'm begging you, okay?

388
00:33:49,054 --> 00:33:53,104
Look, I'm really sorry I stole Octa.
I don't know what came over me.

389
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:56,064
-I never steal things.
-Why not?

390
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:58,341
Because it's wrong.

391
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:00,621
So then you've Iearnt
a valuable moral Iesson.

392
00:34:00,694 --> 00:34:01,695
Yes, I have.

393
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:05,176
And you'II never do anything wrong again,
as Iong as you Iive.

394
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:09,498
-No, I won't.
-You see? Now you're a thief and a Iiar.

395
00:34:09,574 --> 00:34:12,100
What did Mr Tiny want?

396
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:15,419
-Mr Tiny?
-The fat man in the Iimousine!

397
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:20,542
I don't know, something about souls and...
And destiny.

398
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:22,261
And he knew where I Iived.

399
00:34:22,334 --> 00:34:25,941
Looks Iike you're in deep shit,
my Iarcenous friend.

400
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:29,336
Mr Tiny doesn't just take a random interest
in people.

401
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:33,339
And the people he does take an interest in
wind up dead or worse.

402
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:39,217
What's worse than dead?

403
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:41,741
Oh.

404
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:44,063
Lots of things.

405
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:52,743
AII right. I'II do it. I'II make you a bargain.

406
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:57,420
You'II become my assistant.
I'II turn you into a half vampire.

407
00:34:57,493 --> 00:35:00,622
You'II be able to go out in the daylight,
very useful for me.

408
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:03,981
You'II do chores for me
and guard my coffin on the road.

409
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:07,614
And in return,
I'II try and keep Mr Tiny away from you.

410
00:35:07,693 --> 00:35:10,503
Oh, and I'II save your stupid friend Steve,

411
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:13,543
despite the fact that he threatened to kill me.

412
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:20,455
-You'II save Steve?
-Why not?

413
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:28,383
If I became a half vampire,
would I have to kill people?

414
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:31,063
Interested, huh?

415
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:35,664
Vampires don't kill the people they feed on.
Vampaneze do.

416
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:39,579
Big source of controversy,
war for about 80 years, then a truce,

417
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:42,782
getting ugly again, apparently.
But time's wasting.

418
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:48,056
Want to become a vampire?

419
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:52,541
It's a Ionely Iife, but there's Iots of it.

420
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,813
I can't make that decision right now.

421
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,417
Do you wanna go home
and ask your mommy and daddy?

422
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,134
Do they make all the decisions
for good Iittle boys Iike you?

423
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:06,938
No, they don't.

424
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:12,064
Poor Steve doesn't have much time Ieft.

425
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:23,422
Fine, I'II do it.
To save my friend, not for any other reason.

426
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:26,899
-So get the antidote.
-Right here.

427
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,496
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-First things first.

428
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:35,462
Let's test your blood.

429
00:36:37,013 --> 00:36:40,142
What are you doing? I'm not gonna bite you
in the jugular. I could kill you that way.

430
00:36:40,213 --> 00:36:41,863
Show me your hands.

431
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:46,540
Ow!

432
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,454
Mmm.

433
00:36:49,013 --> 00:36:53,018
You have good blood. This will work.
AII right, hold up your hands.

434
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,342
-We're going to exchange blood.
-That's creepy.

435
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:58,700
I know. But that's how it's done.

436
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:11,498
This may hurt when it gets to your heart.

437
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:25,784
I feel cold.

438
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:29,177
Lick your fingers.

439
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:42,016
Whoa, is that Iike vampire power?
Do I have super-spit now?

440
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,540
Yes, you have super-spit.
The rest will take a while.

441
00:37:47,813 --> 00:37:49,338
The rest of what? What will I be able to do?

442
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:53,020
-Can I, Iike, turn into a bat and stuff?
-No, that's bullshit.

443
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:56,539
Now hop on my back. We're going to flit.

444
00:37:57,173 --> 00:38:00,382
-We're gonna what?
-Just shut up and hop on my back.

445
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:15,138
You held your breath, right?
Did I not tell you to hold your breath?

446
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:18,297
Oh... Sorry.

447
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:25,017
Hold on.

448
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:29,178
-Why didn't we just take the elevator?
-I get claustrophobic.

449
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:31,904
Strange, huh,
given where I sleep every night.

450
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:35,580
But somehow when it's my own
confined space, it's different.

451
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:40,020
He Iooks horrible.
Can you give him the antidote, please?

452
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:46,495
She really didn't Iike him.

453
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,458
Be careful.

454
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,502
Hey, what are you doing?

455
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,214
Shh.

456
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,374
That's it, right? He's gonna be better now?

457
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:21,500
That's it.

458
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:32,299
-You are insufferable.
-Back! Stay back!

459
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:33,374
Code blue,,,

460
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:36,263
You have no idea
how ridiculous you Iook right now.

461
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,414
Code blue,,,

462
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:40,542
AII right. If you want to pretend
this isn't happening, fine.

463
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:43,742
But being a vampire takes skill.
What is a code blue?

464
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:45,338
Code blue, code blue,,,

465
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:47,939
Try not to do something stupid
Iike kill your family.

466
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:51,096
Code blue, code blue, room 519, stat.

467
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:53,096
You are not supposed to be in here!

468
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:56,017
Code blue,
All available staff pleasereport to room,,,

469
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:05,335
It must have hurt.
-Yeah, it hurt.

470
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:09,256
-It wasn't... It wasn't fun.
-It's great you're back.

471
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:10,379
-Yeah.
-We missed you.

472
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:13,376
Well, well, well, Steve is back, huh?

473
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:17,457
So, Steve, what you got for me?

474
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:30,700
Stay away from those brownies.
They're for dessert.

475
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:33,543
-Okay. No brownies.
-Next...

476
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:49,095
Hey, Darren, do you think that this outfit
Iooks better on her, or this?

477
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:53,817
What's going on?

478
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:00,657
You Iook weird. Darren.

479
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,093
Darren!

480
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:07,933
Sorry.

481
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,702
Sorry, I...
I was just pretending to be a vampire.

482
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:20,863
Nice room.

483
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:24,533
Some excellent reading material
you have here.

484
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:27,263
Thought this was all on the Internet now.

485
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:29,541
-Mine's blocked.
-Hmm.

486
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:34,934
Don't... No, don't do that. Don't cry.

487
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:37,980
-Honestly. Stop, stop.
-No.

488
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:41,422
-I'm not crying.
-Of course not. That's what...

489
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:46,054
Look, I don't want to hurt people, okay?
I'm not Iike you.

490
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:48,340
I was this close away from killing my sister.

491
00:41:48,412 --> 00:41:52,383
Perhaps you should have thought of that
before you stole my spider!

492
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:59,219
Look, I'm sorry, but you can't stay here.
You're going to have to Ieave them.

493
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,742
-Like forever?
-Like forever.

494
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,102
It's time to admit that to yourself, Darren.

495
00:42:16,172 --> 00:42:18,095
But you can't just Ieave.

496
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:20,815
You're going to have to die first.

497
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:31,462
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

498
00:42:31,572 --> 00:42:32,653
Hmm?

499
00:42:35,412 --> 00:42:36,937
Hi. Hi.

500
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:43,063
Hey, I just wanted to say that you guys
are really, really good parents.

501
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:47,376
You're doing a great job,
and I'm sorry for not doing all my chores

502
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:49,500
and for complaining so much.

503
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:55,255
-And I Iove you guys a Iot.
-We Iove you, too, sweetie.

504
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:08,377
Bye, Annie.

505
00:43:13,332 --> 00:43:16,063
How old were you
when you became a vampire?

506
00:43:17,332 --> 00:43:20,859
Twenty. It was 1803, the third of May.

507
00:43:21,972 --> 00:43:25,055
I'd just been Ieft by my fiancee,
Hesther Collins.

508
00:43:25,652 --> 00:43:28,701
I thought she was the most beautiful girl
in Baltimore.

509
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,140
I saw her again 60 years Iater.
She was an old crone,

510
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:36,223
but my heart still beat Iike a jackrabbit.

511
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:41,343
Wow, dumped, huh?

512
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:44,702
So big, bad, old Crepsley became a vampire
'cause he got dumped?

513
00:43:46,612 --> 00:43:48,580
Have you ever been dumped?

514
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:52,097
Yeah.

515
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:55,255
Then perhaps
you should be more sympathetic.

516
00:43:55,372 --> 00:43:58,376
Here it is. Drink up.

517
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:14,140
-My Iips are numb.
-Good.

518
00:44:17,332 --> 00:44:20,620
-I've got pins and needles in my hands.
-Excellent.

519
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,581
That means it's working.

520
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:28,461
Nice night, actually.

521
00:44:29,972 --> 00:44:33,977
Is that the Little Dipper or the Big one?
I can never remember.

522
00:44:34,052 --> 00:44:35,417
Sorry about that.

523
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:38,780
I had to do that or they would never
believe you were dead. Don't worry.

524
00:44:38,852 --> 00:44:40,854
There's no damage to your spinal cord,

525
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:43,538
and I'II sneak into the funeral home
and fix your broken neck.

526
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:47,094
Oh, and sorry about this next part.

527
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:04,938
Darren,

528
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:10,138
I hate you so much
for Ieaving me here with these idiots.

529
00:45:22,412 --> 00:45:25,382
Darren. Hey, Shan!

530
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:28,574
-Ass wipe, are you in there? Darren!
-Steve.

531
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:32,542
Okay, time out, time out. Not about you.
We're all feeling grief.

532
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:24,377
Wake-y, wake-y.

533
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,460
Here. Fill that hole.

534
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:31,218
I can't do that.
I'm all cramped up. My Iegs are still numb.

535
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:34,461
-Can you feel this?
-Ow! What the heck?

536
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:42,612
-Do you smell a rotting corpse?
-Ha, ha, very funny.

537
00:46:43,451 --> 00:46:46,295
-Get back in the grave.
-I'm not getting back in the grave.

538
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,851
-Don't argue with me. Get in.
-No.

539
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:02,533
Hello, old friend. OId Crepsley.
How's the scar?

540
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:05,702
Shall I give you another?

541
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:57,818
Hello, bag of blood.

542
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:01,020
You're coming with me.

543
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:09,252
Run!

544
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:27,660
You come with Murlaugh now.
You're one of us.

545
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:30,691
Not one of those filthy vampires.

546
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:33,336
Let me go!

547
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,534
Where are we going?

548
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:47,582
-Hold your breath.
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

549
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:01,253
-Let's go!
-Not yet!

550
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:08,460
Don't Iook behind you.

551
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:17,372
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Are you all right?

552
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:20,097
Come here!

553
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:27,533
Breathe.

554
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,498
Right over the plate!

555
00:49:30,571 --> 00:49:34,132
Oh, my God.
-Do you know those guys?

556
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:38,697
-Are we there yet?
-AImost.

557
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:45,297
Where are we?

558
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:47,454
The Cirque's
winter campgrounds.

559
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,499
You'II be safe here if they Iet you stay.

560
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:51,696
Try to fit in.

561
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:56,732
-Come on.
-So all the freaks Iive here?

562
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,537
Yes.

563
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:06,816
Don't stare.

564
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:14,776
It's really...

565
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:27,937
You want to go to my tent?
You know, we can rehearse in my tent.

566
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:29,979
I'm not gonna rehearse in your tent.

567
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:33,379
It'II be great, you know.
You always have fun in my tent.

568
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:40,735
Wait here for me.

569
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:43,182
Well, I was thinking about it.

570
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:45,174
I mean, you're not gonna be
able to do this forever, right?

571
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,219
If you set everything up,
so I can just fill it out.

572
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:50,818
Neutral. The Cirque
has always remained neutral.

573
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:55,414
-That's how it has survived all these years.
-You'II still be neutral.

574
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,017
I'm not trying to drag you into anything.
I'm trying to keep myself out of it.

575
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,900
And why exactly do you think
Tiny wants this boy?

576
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,540
I'm not sure yet.

577
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,734
But whenever Mr Tiny wants something,

578
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,461
I make it my policy to try
and keep him from it.

579
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,658
That's a dangerous policy.

580
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,296
Hey, what are you doing?
That's Mr Tall's tent.

581
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,499
Hi, I'm Darren.

582
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,731
What are you doing here?

583
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,620
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

584
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,412
You can Iisten if you want.

585
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,540
-How much does the boy know?
-Nothing.

586
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,853
He's waiting by my tent
if you want to speak with him.

587
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,015
You know, Larten, the thing you might
not realise about children is,

588
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,298
they don't always do what they're told!

589
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,460
Rebecca. Don't you have work
you should be doing?

590
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:54,898
Yes. Sorry, Mr Tall. It won't happen again.
I mean, I don't eavesdrop on people.

591
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,496
-It was his idea.
-I didn't make you do anything.

592
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,299
Well, you couldn't make me do anything
if you tried.

593
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,691
-Oh, really, huh?
Enough. Rebecca,

594
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,374
I would Iike you to take Darren to Evra's tent.

595
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:08,374
Evra will be his roommate
while he stays with us.

596
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,697
You'II have to work, Darren.
Everybody here pitches in.

597
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,416
That's fine.

598
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,973
I actually worked for my dad's office
a couple of weeks this summer.

599
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,018
I did photocopies, so...

600
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:29,453
This is on a temporary basis, Larten.
I can't endanger everybody for your sake.

601
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,259
Of course. Thank you.

602
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,260
So, what are you doing here anyway,
with all these freaks?

603
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,618
Why? Do you have a problem with freaks?

604
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:42,695
No, I mean, they kind of freak me out, but...

605
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:45,376
They freak you out. CIever, really clever.

606
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,613
Well, I really have to get back to work.
Harkat can show you the way.

607
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,896
Harkat, take Darren to Evra's tent, please.

608
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,298
Well, you better follow him.

609
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,813
Okay, see you sometime.

610
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,258
No, I saw what you did to
my friend Steve's hand at the theatre, buddy.

611
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,815
Dude, I'm not giving you my hand, okay?

612
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,380
I'm sorry. Here.

613
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,376
Harkat!

614
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:38,535
You have to stop biting people,
or no one will want to be around you.

615
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:44,857
You.

616
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,096
Death.

617
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,818
Redemption. Despair.

618
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,214
Triumph. Disaster.

619
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,415
What did I say?

620
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:08,259
"Death, redemption, despair,
triumph, disaster."

621
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:14,578
Well, don't worry about it.
Go ahead, Harkat. Take him to Evra's.

622
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,734
And no more teeth.

623
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:29,018
You mean, this is it?

624
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:34,258
Chill in the Iaundry for a sec.
There you go. Good girl.

625
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:39,453
Good snake. Love you.

626
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:46,541
So, I guess we're gonna be roommates.
So how are you f'd up?

627
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,221
-F'd up?
-Freaked up.

628
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:53,852
-How... What kind of freak are you?
-Oh, I'm not a freak. I'm normal.

629
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,252
-You're normal?
-No. I mean, I'm half vampire,

630
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,980
but I'm completely normal.

631
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,781
You're a half vampire, but you're normal.

632
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:04,735
I Iike that.

633
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,371
And don't worry about, Iike,
if I'm gonna drink your blood or anything.

634
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,499
I'm not gonna drink anyone's blood.

635
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,178
What a relief. Okay, this isn't awkward at all.

636
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,537
This is your corner of the tent. AII right?

637
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,692
You do not cross over
to any other part of the tent,

638
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:24,341
except to enter and exit the tent. AII right?

639
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:28,495
And you are never, ever to touch my stuff,
especially this stuff over here.

640
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,572
This is my recording studio.

641
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:34,098
Oh, cool. Yeah, I...
I actually used to have a drum set,

642
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,538
but, you know, my parents made me
give it away, so...

643
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,260
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

644
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,691
Well, there are no parents here.

645
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:45,576
Oh...

646
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,219
Yeah. Shedding, itches Iike crazy.

647
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:53,778
You should actually go wash
your hand off before you get pink eye.

648
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:59,371
Did you forget to tell me you were going to
go away for a couple of days? Huh?

649
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,660
I can't believe you're treating me Iike this.
I've been worried sick.

650
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,334
Why can't you just get a cell phone?

651
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,014
Because vampires don't need cell phones.

652
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:10,140
"Vampires don't need this,
vampires don't need that."

653
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,212
I'II tell you what vampires need.

654
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,453
They need to Iisten.
Didn't I tell you that I had a foreboding?

655
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:18,738
And what do you do?
You show up here with that kid.

656
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:23,371
It's been a Iong night. I just flitted across
two states. I think I'II just hit the pine early.

657
00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:24,929
No, wait.

658
00:56:27,169 --> 00:56:30,298
You don't Iove me any more. It's my beard.

659
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:34,971
You know how I feel about you.
I just don't want to outlive anyone.

660
00:56:35,049 --> 00:56:39,577
It's depressing watching people you care
about grow old while you stay young.

661
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:42,459
Have you Iooked at yourself
in the mirror Iately?

662
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:45,174
You're no kid.

663
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,573
Oh, no, no. I'm still angry at you. Mmm-mmm.

664
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:51,697
Mmm-mmm.

665
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:56,139
Your mouth says no,
but your beard says yes.

666
00:56:57,009 --> 00:56:58,215
I can't believe he's gone, man.

667
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,259
-I know. He was Iike my best friend.
-No, he was my best friend.

668
00:57:01,329 --> 00:57:02,899
-I knew him first.
-So what?

669
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:04,858
I thought he was a dick.

670
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:06,533
-What?
-What?

671
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:08,254
-Dude.
-Oh, my...

672
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,060
Here, get up before one of the teachers
see you. That kid's psycho.

673
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:20,650
Mr Leonard, what you got for me here?
Finish the quiz already?

674
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:33,980
Careful.
-Whoa!

675
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:37,291
The first step is a big one.

676
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:42,053
Oh, I know.
You miss the one known as Darren.

677
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:47,374
You feel betrayed, abandoned.
You're a Ioyal friend,

678
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:49,700
unlike him.

679
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:55,255
-Darren was a Ioyal friend.
-Oh, really?

680
00:57:55,649 --> 00:58:00,132
What if I told you he's still alive?
He's taken your place,

681
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:03,816
stealing your dreams. Oh, I know.

682
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:07,336
You dream of killing people,
drinking their blood.

683
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:12,017
You dream of Ieading
a great, bloodthirsty army.

684
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:13,818
Who the hell are you?

685
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:17,492
-I'm Mr Tiny.
-Are you a vampire?

686
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:21,051
No, I'm not a vampire. I'm not a Vampaneze.

687
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:23,735
I'm an aficionado.

688
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:28,370
I want to see a marvellous war.

689
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:30,895
What do you want from me, you freak?

690
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:35,777
I'm not a freak. I despise freaks.

691
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:39,058
Can a freak travel back and forth
between Iife and death?

692
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:40,460
I think not.

693
00:58:40,529 --> 00:58:44,295
Can a freak create new Iife
from rotting flesh and dead souls?

694
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:45,495
PIease.

695
00:58:45,569 --> 00:58:50,860
Can a freak bring about the apocalypse
and rule the world?

696
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,809
No.

697
00:58:54,169 --> 00:58:59,812
Sadly, neither can I, not without help.
I need a champion.

698
00:59:00,649 --> 00:59:05,132
One of two boys, two dear friends.

699
00:59:06,689 --> 00:59:10,375
And by the way, I Iove your DNA.

700
00:59:17,089 --> 00:59:18,898
You care for a pancake?

701
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,736
-No, I can't. I'm...
-We know what you are.

702
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:25,611
You're bad news. That's what.

703
00:59:25,689 --> 00:59:30,570
But nothing I couldn't deal with
in just about two bites.

704
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:34,819
Don't mind him. He just needs some Ex-Lax.

705
00:59:34,889 --> 00:59:37,620
-Welcome to the Cirque.
-Thank you.

706
00:59:38,129 --> 00:59:40,609
Would you Iike to eat one of my hands?
I can grow them back.

707
00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:41,770
Yeah, they are delicious.

708
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,851
Hey, Vampelina.

709
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:45,533
Come on,
we gotta go clean out Wolfie's cage,

710
00:59:45,609 --> 00:59:49,534
and then Crepsley Ieft, Iike,
a Iist of stuff for you to do for him.

711
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:50,940
It Iooks Iike you're Crepsley's bitch now.

712
00:59:51,009 --> 00:59:52,295
-Evra.
-What?

713
00:59:58,049 --> 01:00:00,973
Okay, so you guys are gonna do it. And go.

714
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,340
I can't believe
the tiny people eat these rats.

715
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:13,649
They'II eat you
if you don't watch out.

716
01:00:14,889 --> 01:00:15,936
Don't!

717
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:34,256
So where do you come from anyways?

718
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:48,057
I guess I could probably, Iike, open this up,

719
01:00:48,129 --> 01:00:51,372
and you'd probably turn into dust
or something, huh?

720
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:54,578
You wouldn't Iike that now,
would you, Dracula?

721
01:00:54,649 --> 01:00:56,139
Who's the boss now, baby?

722
01:00:57,129 --> 01:01:01,134
Okay. Concentrate now.
How hard can it be to flit?

723
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:17,530
Ow. Perfect.

724
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:38,219
What's the point?

725
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:50,296
-I'm just not that much of a freak.
-Gertha, you're a major freak.

726
01:01:56,168 --> 01:01:58,774
Sorry, you're not my type.

727
01:02:00,048 --> 01:02:02,130
Do you ever miss your family?

728
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:05,969
Not really.

729
01:02:06,048 --> 01:02:08,892
I joined the Cirque when I was two.
Two days old, that is.

730
01:02:08,968 --> 01:02:12,654
Mr Tall found me in a dumpster.
So I guess this is my family.

731
01:02:14,848 --> 01:02:18,455
Dumpster baby,
oh, dumpster baby

732
01:02:18,528 --> 01:02:21,896
I wanna be your dumpster baby

733
01:02:24,448 --> 01:02:25,335
No.

734
01:02:44,048 --> 01:02:46,699
Hey, thisis Steve,You know what to do,

735
01:02:50,008 --> 01:02:52,329
-What are you doing?
-Oh, nothing.

736
01:02:53,528 --> 01:02:54,939
May I see it?

737
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:59,577
-Yeah, I guess.
-I've always wanted one of these.

738
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:02,976
Hey! What are you doing?

739
01:03:03,048 --> 01:03:05,574
We must be very careful
who we talk to, Darren.

740
01:03:21,808 --> 01:03:24,539
Go to your tent and stay there with Evra.

741
01:03:39,728 --> 01:03:42,891
Yes. I have returned.

742
01:03:46,888 --> 01:03:49,619
I have returned!

743
01:03:50,608 --> 01:03:55,216
Unacceptable. Unforgivable.
To blood a child?

744
01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,174
By the way, is he drinking enough blood?

745
01:04:00,248 --> 01:04:03,570
-He's not drinking any blood.
-Not drinking blood?

746
01:04:04,288 --> 01:04:07,098
Crepsley, don't you know he has to?
He must.

747
01:04:08,528 --> 01:04:11,577
Or perhaps you're worried
he'II Iove it too much.

748
01:04:13,968 --> 01:04:17,529
-He might be Vampaneze at heart.
-You'd Iike that.

749
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:19,815
You've been favouring them
for the Iast 1 00 years.

750
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:24,815
On the contrary, I'm strictly neutral,
Iike the Cirque.

751
01:04:24,888 --> 01:04:26,936
Correct, Mr Tall?

752
01:04:28,688 --> 01:04:29,894
Correct.

753
01:04:31,088 --> 01:04:33,170
Then tell us why you want him.

754
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:36,491
It's one of your self-fulfilling prophecies,
isn't it?

755
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:39,253
Well, one does dream of the cataclysm.

756
01:04:41,768 --> 01:04:45,250
This truce may not Iast forever.

757
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:48,377
There might be new Ieaders.
New blood, as it were.

758
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:53,008
Perhaps a boy, a bloodthirsty boy.

759
01:04:54,328 --> 01:04:56,535
It's all been written.

760
01:04:56,608 --> 01:04:59,737
Then why do you care?
You're up to something, Desmond.

761
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:03,813
Me? I may write the script,

762
01:05:03,888 --> 01:05:07,779
but the characters have a tendency
to do as they please.

763
01:05:07,848 --> 01:05:11,898
You, for example,
have an unseemly amount of free will.

764
01:05:11,968 --> 01:05:17,338
Now, Mr Tall, will you be reasonable
and give me the child?

765
01:05:17,808 --> 01:05:21,733
I've always done what you ask.
I'm not one to cause trouble.

766
01:05:24,928 --> 01:05:29,411
But I need to think about all this.
I won't make a decision hastily.

767
01:05:29,488 --> 01:05:33,015
You know, I always get what I want,
in the end.

768
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:46,130
Keep an eye on him, my pets,

769
01:05:57,008 --> 01:06:00,535
Hey, dude. Sorry, we're on our own today.

770
01:06:01,408 --> 01:06:03,809
Rebecca's back in the costume shop.

771
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:26,173
-Hey.
-Hey.

772
01:06:27,888 --> 01:06:30,095
I'm here for Crepsley's cape.

773
01:06:30,168 --> 01:06:33,570
-It's that red one with, Iike, the...
-I know what Crepsley's cape Iooks Iike.

774
01:06:33,648 --> 01:06:35,571
What do your friends want?

775
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:39,139
Hey! Beat it!

776
01:06:42,088 --> 01:06:43,897
Does this trailer have, Iike,
a back entrance or something?

777
01:06:43,968 --> 01:06:47,336
Yeah, it's right back there.
Wait, your pants are ripped.

778
01:06:47,408 --> 01:06:51,413
Take them off. Try this pair on.

779
01:06:53,248 --> 01:06:55,569
They fit.
-Yeah.

780
01:07:01,088 --> 01:07:04,216
So, you know, Rebecca, you...

781
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:08,614
You never really told me
what you're doing here with the Cirque.

782
01:07:08,687 --> 01:07:11,418
Well, Darren, since you ask,

783
01:07:12,847 --> 01:07:14,417
I'm a monkey girl.

784
01:07:15,807 --> 01:07:17,809
-You're a what?
-What?

785
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:21,016
Nothing, I thought you just said
you were a monkey girl.

786
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:22,577
Well, oh, yeah.

787
01:07:24,487 --> 01:07:25,534
Yeah.

788
01:07:29,127 --> 01:07:31,414
What does that mean?

789
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:35,572
It means I have a tail.
Do you have a problem with that?

790
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:40,694
No, because... 'Cause you're joking, right?

791
01:07:40,767 --> 01:07:45,170
No, I'm not joking. I keep it wrapped up
because people kept stepping on it.

792
01:07:46,927 --> 01:07:47,974
Oh.

793
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:49,214
Yeah.

794
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:52,814
Anyway, your pants Iook really good.

795
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:57,490
Yeah, I know. You picked it out.
That's really good.

796
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,128
Shush!

797
01:08:06,727 --> 01:08:09,458
Thanks. They've been spying on me all day.

798
01:08:11,847 --> 01:08:15,818
So if you were interested in a girl, okay,
and she had Iike...

799
01:08:16,447 --> 01:08:20,497
Like a tail, Iet's say,
would that be a problem or...

800
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:22,490
Well, I'II put it to you this way.

801
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:24,296
If you had told me
a couple hundred years ago

802
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:27,211
that I would someday be dating a woman
with bristles on her chin,

803
01:08:27,287 --> 01:08:30,814
I would have told you you were insane.
But here we are.

804
01:08:33,087 --> 01:08:36,933
By the way, there's a new rule.
You're not to Ieave camp any more.

805
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:39,768
-Why not?
-Because I said so.

806
01:08:42,007 --> 01:08:45,329
You're not my dad.
You can't just tell me what to do...

807
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:50,767
When was the Iast time
you were in a fight?

808
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:52,008
Uh... Second grade.

809
01:08:53,007 --> 01:08:54,896
Steve's usually the one
that gets in all the fights.

810
01:08:54,967 --> 01:08:57,413
Well, Steve's not here to fight for you.

811
01:08:57,487 --> 01:08:59,569
And what if I wasn't, either?

812
01:09:00,487 --> 01:09:03,491
What if you were alone in the dark
and someone wanted to kill you?

813
01:09:03,567 --> 01:09:06,332
Rip out your heart and drink its blood?

814
01:09:06,407 --> 01:09:07,693
What then?

815
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:12,807
Crepsley?

816
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:16,931
Crepsley, come on.

817
01:09:20,647 --> 01:09:21,853
Crepsley?

818
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:32,011
-You're hurting me.
-What are you going to do about it? Well?

819
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:40,210
You're soft. You're a soft Iittle boy.

820
01:09:40,287 --> 01:09:43,496
They're Iooking for you, Darren.
This is not the schoolyard.

821
01:09:43,567 --> 01:09:47,811
You either have to Iearn to fight or to run.
So which is it going to be?

822
01:09:58,287 --> 01:10:02,451
Good. But don't use your fist.
You have something better.

823
01:10:02,527 --> 01:10:05,770
Use your fingernails Iike a dagger. Watch.

824
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:14,087
Try it. Extend your fingers
and follow all the way through.

825
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,931
Use all your strength.

826
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:22,773
Ow!

827
01:10:23,527 --> 01:10:27,293
-God, I think I broke a nail.
-You broke a nail?

828
01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:32,251
You need blood.
We have a Iot of work to do.

829
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:40,412
-BIood will have blood.
BIood will have blood.

830
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:43,809
Are you ready, you filthy Iittle pig,
to be stuck?

831
01:10:43,887 --> 01:10:46,174
Do you renounce Iiving with the Iiving?

832
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:49,333
Are you prepared to die with the dead?

833
01:11:15,447 --> 01:11:19,293
-Steve, what the hell are you doing?
-Well, hi, Mr Kersey.

834
01:11:19,887 --> 01:11:21,651
I just wanted to stop by real quick

835
01:11:21,727 --> 01:11:25,368
and actually apologise for the way,
you know, I've been acting in school Iately.

836
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,609
It's 3:00 a.m.

837
01:11:27,687 --> 01:11:30,577
My teachers troubled me when I was a Iad.

838
01:11:34,407 --> 01:11:38,776
They caned me and caned me
till I was bloody.

839
01:11:42,327 --> 01:11:46,048
Then one day, I took up a broken switch,

840
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:49,731
and I rammed it in my teacher's eyeball.

841
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:55,617
-Who are you?
-I'm his mentor.

842
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:03,417
You see, Steve?

843
01:12:04,447 --> 01:12:05,494
Ow!

844
01:12:07,287 --> 01:12:10,131
This is what Crepsley wants us to Iive with.

845
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:22,137
So, Mr Kersey, what you got for me?

846
01:12:23,007 --> 01:12:26,328
-So you really don't kill people?
-No, Darren.

847
01:12:27,286 --> 01:12:31,132
You just sedate them and feed a Iittle bit,
and then Ieave.

848
01:12:31,206 --> 01:12:33,254
I actually developed the method.

849
01:12:33,326 --> 01:12:36,887
Well, two other vampires and I,
Gavner and Vincent.

850
01:12:37,726 --> 01:12:40,616
We were the freaks of the vampire world.
No one understood us.

851
01:12:40,686 --> 01:12:42,734
And then they started to realise

852
01:12:42,806 --> 01:12:45,571
that if you don't kill your prey every time
Iike a Iittle piggy,

853
01:12:45,686 --> 01:12:50,328
then you don't get hunted down by irate
townspeople with pitchforks and torches.

854
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:55,408
And now half the vampires feed this way,
and the other half hate us.

855
01:12:58,126 --> 01:12:59,412
Quiet now.

856
01:13:08,206 --> 01:13:10,095
Whoa! How'd you do that?

857
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:13,929
Vampires can exhale a gas
that knocks out humans.

858
01:13:14,006 --> 01:13:15,007
Really?

859
01:13:15,086 --> 01:13:18,295
Drink some blood,
you'II be able to do all kinds of things.

860
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:23,247
Now, we just make a small incision
in his shoulder. Right here.

861
01:13:25,766 --> 01:13:27,655
And then you take a sip.

862
01:13:29,086 --> 01:13:32,408
Don't worry. He won't become a vampire
unless you exchange blood with him.

863
01:13:32,486 --> 01:13:36,855
Go ahead. I had some a couple of days ago.
It's very refreshing.

864
01:13:36,926 --> 01:13:39,088
No, I'm not gonna drink human blood.

865
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,693
Hurry up, before someone sees us.
We haven't got all night.

866
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:45,256
I'm not going to.

867
01:13:48,726 --> 01:13:52,890
You have to drink blood, Darren,
or you'II die. It's as simple as that.

868
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,572
Damn kid is gonna get himself killed.

869
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:04,417
Larten, what made you blood him?

870
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:08,247
I needed someone to run errands for me.

871
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:11,375
Oh, come on,
you didn't need to blood him for that.

872
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:14,450
I had a feeling if I didn't,
something terrible would happen to him.

873
01:14:14,526 --> 01:14:19,134
Something terrible?
As opposed to becoming a vampire?

874
01:14:21,886 --> 01:14:23,934
I think you're getting Ionely.

875
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:28,807
After 200 years of Iiving alone, why on earth
would I suddenly become Ionely?

876
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:32,857
I don't know. Midlife crisis? What is it?

877
01:14:34,046 --> 01:14:35,127
They're here.

878
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,452
Watch out!

879
01:15:47,446 --> 01:15:49,175
-That's not fair.
-Back!

880
01:15:49,246 --> 01:15:51,248
Darren, get out of here!

881
01:15:51,806 --> 01:15:52,887
Duck!

882
01:15:58,326 --> 01:15:59,373
Move.

883
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,052
Get in.

884
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:08,173
Psst.

885
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,377
Hey! Hey!

886
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:49,257
Look, I don't even Iike the Wolfman,

887
01:16:49,326 --> 01:16:52,808
but that don't mean you can come in here
and beat up on a freak!

888
01:16:52,886 --> 01:16:54,775
You're messing
with the wrong sideshow, baby!

889
01:16:54,846 --> 01:16:58,817
-I'II bite your damn noses off!
-I'm gonna ram my head up your ass.

890
01:16:58,886 --> 01:16:59,933
Stop!

891
01:17:01,526 --> 01:17:02,607
Stop!

892
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,294
There'II be no fighting here.

893
01:17:07,846 --> 01:17:12,693
How dare you enter this campground?
The Vampire Council will hear of this.

894
01:17:16,606 --> 01:17:19,610
Tell the Iittle vampire it's time to come home.

895
01:17:20,326 --> 01:17:24,615
It's almost dawn. I have a spare coffin here.
I suggest you get some rest as well.

896
01:17:24,686 --> 01:17:26,973
Aren't we gonna, Iike, double back
and attack them or something?

897
01:17:27,046 --> 01:17:28,286
Do you want to stay alive?

898
01:17:28,366 --> 01:17:32,451
You're not even drinking blood yet.
I doubt you'd be much good in a fight.

899
01:17:32,526 --> 01:17:36,611
-Well, what if they hurt someone?
-People can Iook out for themselves.

900
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:39,373
You've been Iooking out for me.

901
01:17:39,806 --> 01:17:44,448
-Why?
-Why? Because I'm an idiot, that's why.

902
01:17:45,246 --> 01:17:47,931
Only an idiot would spit
in the eye of Mr Tiny.

903
01:17:48,006 --> 01:17:51,327
Because he doesn't just kill people,
he brings them back, as well.

904
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:54,852
And when I finally die,
I plan on staying dead.

905
01:17:56,165 --> 01:18:00,534
Life may be meaningless,
but death I still have hope for.

906
01:18:01,565 --> 01:18:03,852
Life isn't meaningless.

907
01:18:03,925 --> 01:18:07,930
Tell me that after 200 years of it, kid.
Good day.

908
01:18:17,845 --> 01:18:20,132
- You know I never Iiked him.
- I never did, either.

909
01:18:20,205 --> 01:18:23,607
- I told you when I first saw him.
- Should never have Iet him in.

910
01:18:23,685 --> 01:18:24,925
We all know it's his fault.

911
01:18:25,005 --> 01:18:28,214
I just can't believe
he has the nerve to walk around in here.

912
01:18:28,285 --> 01:18:29,889
That poor Rebecca.

913
01:18:34,045 --> 01:18:37,527
They took her? Where?

914
01:18:38,565 --> 01:18:43,446
I don't know,
but they said to tell you to come home.

915
01:18:45,365 --> 01:18:49,973
Which, of course, you're not gonna do.
Wait, Darren, Darren. No, buddy.

916
01:18:50,045 --> 01:18:51,251
Those guys are huge, man.

917
01:18:57,885 --> 01:19:02,174
-Hey, Mr and Mrs Shan. Hey, Annie.
-Steve. What are you doing here?

918
01:19:02,725 --> 01:19:07,447
Well, you know, I've been thinking.
You guys probably really miss your son.

919
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:11,814
And my mom is drunk half the time,
so she doesn't really notice I'm there.

920
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:15,171
How about you guys adopt me?

921
01:19:18,365 --> 01:19:19,730
No interest?

922
01:19:21,045 --> 01:19:23,366
Told you they wouldn't go for it.

923
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:25,286
Hmm.

924
01:19:25,685 --> 01:19:27,289
How disappointing.

925
01:19:28,045 --> 01:19:32,494
So few "people" have the parenting instinct
the way I do.

926
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:39,689
Ready for the prom?

927
01:19:51,205 --> 01:19:54,891
Make newfriends, but keep the old

928
01:19:54,965 --> 01:19:58,174
Oneis silver and the other's gold

929
01:19:58,245 --> 01:20:02,330
Make newfriends, but keep the old

930
01:20:02,405 --> 01:20:05,614
Oneis silver and the other's gold

931
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:59,929
Hey, Octa.
Say goodbye to Crepsley for me, okay?

932
01:21:00,005 --> 01:21:02,212
Tell him I'm sorry but I have to go home.

933
01:21:06,925 --> 01:21:09,132
It's time, isn't it?

934
01:21:30,805 --> 01:21:35,413
-Twenty-six, 27.
-Twenty-seven, 27.

935
01:21:35,885 --> 01:21:40,174
-AII right, no, no. Twenty-eight.
-May I borrow a couple of these?

936
01:21:42,485 --> 01:21:45,329
Don't forget to bring them back, though.
Both of them.

937
01:21:46,045 --> 01:21:51,256
You're in danger, terrible danger.
Your Iife and soul are in jeopardy.

938
01:21:53,245 --> 01:21:55,407
-What did I say?
-Nothing. Something about the weather.

939
01:21:55,485 --> 01:21:58,887
Chance of thunderstorms tomorrow.
Don't worry. I'II stay indoors.

940
01:22:29,685 --> 01:22:32,256
Applause! Applause!

941
01:22:34,805 --> 01:22:37,809
Look. Little vampire.

942
01:22:39,645 --> 01:22:40,885
Take a bow.

943
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:43,935
-Where are my family and my friends?
-PIease.

944
01:22:44,005 --> 01:22:47,532
Must have patience. Will spoil the show.

945
01:22:52,645 --> 01:22:55,569
Do you Iike? Does Murlaugh have talent?

946
01:22:56,565 --> 01:22:59,330
No? What do you know about talent?

947
01:23:01,405 --> 01:23:03,009
Where is Crepsley?

948
01:23:03,405 --> 01:23:06,966
Where is Crepsley?

949
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:11,805
Too bad for Crapsley.

950
01:23:11,885 --> 01:23:15,286
Because he will miss the show!

951
01:23:16,844 --> 01:23:21,486
Here is freak all wrapped up tight.

952
01:23:23,804 --> 01:23:29,254
And here are beloved family members.
Applause. Applause.

953
01:23:31,724 --> 01:23:35,206
Hello, beloved son. Hello, Ioving parents.

954
01:23:35,284 --> 01:23:39,812
Hello, cute Iittle sister. Four bags of blood.

955
01:23:41,244 --> 01:23:45,044
-Don't worry. You're all gonna be okay.
-Will be better than okay.

956
01:23:45,804 --> 01:23:49,013
Will be delicious!

957
01:23:50,604 --> 01:23:53,005
But now, may I present

958
01:23:53,084 --> 01:23:56,372
reunion with oldest friend
and blood brother,

959
01:23:56,444 --> 01:23:59,607
with he that shall one day rule us all,

960
01:23:59,684 --> 01:24:04,133
the one known as Steve.

961
01:24:05,324 --> 01:24:07,372
Thank you! Thank you!

962
01:24:09,004 --> 01:24:11,769
-Steve.
-You're alive?

963
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:16,848
You know, that was really
an asshole thing for you to do.

964
01:24:16,924 --> 01:24:20,053
Make your whole family and
your secret best friend go through all that?

965
01:24:20,204 --> 01:24:22,650
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody, okay?

966
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,488
Who cares what you meant to do?

967
01:24:24,564 --> 01:24:27,534
What you did was take my place.
That was my dream.

968
01:24:29,204 --> 01:24:33,528
-Steve, what are you doing with him?
-Who? Murlaugh?

969
01:24:33,964 --> 01:24:36,205
Come on, man, he's not as bad as he Iooks.

970
01:24:36,284 --> 01:24:39,208
You know, for one thing,
he didn't say I had bad blood Iike Crepsley.

971
01:24:39,284 --> 01:24:41,491
And for another thing, he didn't Iie to me.

972
01:24:41,564 --> 01:24:44,170
And you know what?
They think I'm awesome.

973
01:24:44,244 --> 01:24:48,374
They say I have a destiny, or whatever.
Look at you.

974
01:24:49,324 --> 01:24:52,692
Who wants to be a vampire anyways?
Vampires suck.

975
01:24:52,924 --> 01:24:55,052
-Vampaneze rule!
-Juicy!

976
01:24:56,284 --> 01:24:58,935
First guy I killed, Mr Kersey.

977
01:24:59,004 --> 01:25:01,974
BIood just gets me going,
you know what I mean?

978
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,806
I wouldn't know. I haven't been drinking any.

979
01:25:07,284 --> 01:25:11,653
I know you. AIways trying to Iook Iike
Mr Goody-Two-Shoes all the time.

980
01:25:12,364 --> 01:25:16,130
I bet you'II, Iike, resist drinking blood
and resist drinking and resist drinking it,

981
01:25:16,204 --> 01:25:18,889
at the Iast second
become this total bloodhound!

982
01:25:21,004 --> 01:25:22,449
AII right, man, here's the deal.

983
01:25:22,524 --> 01:25:25,653
See, the fat guy, he still wants you
on the team, and despite everything else,

984
01:25:25,724 --> 01:25:28,534
you are still my best friend.
So I'II tell you what,

985
01:25:28,604 --> 01:25:31,608
I'II make you a deal
that might just save your ass.

986
01:25:31,684 --> 01:25:34,005
If you kill your family, I'II Iet the freak go.

987
01:25:35,804 --> 01:25:40,605
Wait. My bad, that's backwards.
If you kill the freak, I'II Iet your family Iive.

988
01:25:40,684 --> 01:25:43,051
What? Let the juicy one go?

989
01:25:43,324 --> 01:25:46,692
Hey, Iook, man, it's part of the plan.
Talk to Mr Tiny.

990
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:50,054
So what do you say?

991
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:53,373
Just kill her.
Oh, yeah, you got to drink her blood, too.

992
01:25:53,844 --> 01:25:55,892
You can do her in with this.

993
01:26:21,764 --> 01:26:23,528
Wait!

994
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:27,806
AIIow him in, gentlemen.

995
01:26:29,004 --> 01:26:30,893
I want to see this play out.

996
01:26:32,004 --> 01:26:36,328
Man, that was pathetic. You're totally weak.
You need some blood.

997
01:26:39,284 --> 01:26:41,491
-Murlaugh.
-Finally.

998
01:26:45,444 --> 01:26:47,492
And we thought you weren't gonna show.

999
01:27:41,244 --> 01:27:43,167
I hate spiders!

1000
01:28:01,764 --> 01:28:03,095
Darren. Come here.

1001
01:28:05,084 --> 01:28:06,210
Okay.

1002
01:28:10,004 --> 01:28:12,405
-Is that your tail?
-Well, yeah.

1003
01:28:13,084 --> 01:28:15,405
I'm really sorry I got you involved in this,
okay? I...

1004
01:28:15,484 --> 01:28:18,727
PIease stop staring.
So you really need blood?

1005
01:28:19,644 --> 01:28:21,089
-Yeah.
-AII right.

1006
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:25,413
Can you just take a Iittle? Go ahead.

1007
01:28:26,204 --> 01:28:27,694
I'm offering it to you.

1008
01:28:29,284 --> 01:28:33,448
-Thanks. But I just can't Iose it.
-What?

1009
01:28:34,324 --> 01:28:36,690
Whatever's still making me human.

1010
01:28:37,323 --> 01:28:42,329
Darren, being human's not about
what you are. It's about who you are.

1011
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,084
No.

1012
01:30:11,483 --> 01:30:12,723
He's all yours, Iad.

1013
01:30:32,323 --> 01:30:35,054
Good. Right in the heart.

1014
01:30:36,803 --> 01:30:39,727
So fair and foul a day I have not seen.

1015
01:30:43,203 --> 01:30:45,774
My people aren't weak Iike yours.

1016
01:30:46,723 --> 01:30:48,930
They will avenge me, Crepsley.

1017
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:59,045
The truce, 1 00 years, is over.

1018
01:31:01,283 --> 01:31:03,206
The war begins.

1019
01:31:12,043 --> 01:31:15,013
Marvellous. Magnificent.

1020
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:19,486
Really. Bravo. Bravo.

1021
01:31:19,843 --> 01:31:23,973
It's just Iike you said. We started the war.

1022
01:31:28,603 --> 01:31:32,574
It won't start a war if nobody hears about it.

1023
01:31:37,963 --> 01:31:41,649
Young people today
are so difficult to control.

1024
01:31:53,283 --> 01:31:55,251
-I hate you.
-I hate you!

1025
01:31:55,323 --> 01:31:57,166
I became a vampire to save you, Steve.

1026
01:31:57,243 --> 01:31:58,574
Thanks.

1027
01:32:12,523 --> 01:32:14,730
Go ahead. Just do it!

1028
01:32:28,163 --> 01:32:29,892
That's enough, boys.

1029
01:32:34,603 --> 01:32:36,685
Steve, come with me.

1030
01:32:37,403 --> 01:32:40,486
-Not before I kick his...
-You will behave!

1031
01:32:41,963 --> 01:32:45,172
It's not time for you to fight. Not yet.

1032
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:50,927
-What does that mean?
-Oh, it's all written down in a book.

1033
01:32:51,803 --> 01:32:54,124
You do read books, don't you?

1034
01:33:00,883 --> 01:33:02,123
Steve.

1035
01:33:05,483 --> 01:33:07,326
Look, don't... Don't go.

1036
01:33:08,963 --> 01:33:13,207
What else am I supposed to do, man?
Live with you and a bunch of freaks?

1037
01:33:14,843 --> 01:33:16,493
It's too Iate now.

1038
01:33:17,483 --> 01:33:19,565
I have my destiny, and you have yours.

1039
01:33:20,523 --> 01:33:24,687
How poignant.
The parting of two dear friends.

1040
01:33:25,163 --> 01:33:27,165
Such sweet sorrow.

1041
01:33:28,363 --> 01:33:32,334
Then again,
you will come home to us one day.

1042
01:33:32,963 --> 01:33:35,409
My prodigal son.

1043
01:33:35,483 --> 01:33:39,613
After all, you are the bloodthirsty one.

1044
01:33:40,523 --> 01:33:45,484
No. Just because I'm a vampire
doesn't mean I'm bloodthirsty.

1045
01:33:47,203 --> 01:33:49,809
It's not about what you are.
It's about who you are.

1046
01:33:58,283 --> 01:33:59,329
Oh.

1047
01:33:59,562 --> 01:34:01,052
I almost forgot.

1048
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,206
Cover yourself.

1049
01:34:54,442 --> 01:34:56,683
You have to teach me
how to do that someday.

1050
01:34:56,762 --> 01:34:59,811
Oh, I'II teach you everything, son.

1051
01:34:59,882 --> 01:35:05,810
AII my gibes and gambols.
Now, ready to go meet your people?

1052
01:35:25,042 --> 01:35:26,328
Bye, Annie.

1053
01:35:34,282 --> 01:35:36,284
Will it work Hypnotising them?

1054
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:40,964
It works on the memories,
but not on the emotions, not really.

1055
01:35:42,082 --> 01:35:45,325
They'II always feel
that you're still alive, somehow.

1056
01:35:45,682 --> 01:35:48,652
-Well, that's good, right?
-Is it?

1057
01:35:59,562 --> 01:36:01,690
Hey, can I ask you something?

1058
01:36:05,002 --> 01:36:06,606
Can I kiss you?

1059
01:36:07,682 --> 01:36:12,848
Darren, I Iet you drink my blood.
Sure, you can kiss me.

1060
01:36:35,562 --> 01:36:38,771
Come on. We don't have all night.
I have an injured spider here.

1061
01:36:41,282 --> 01:36:45,048
AII right, how are we going to do this?
I can't carry the both of you.

1062
01:36:46,162 --> 01:36:51,293
-You carry Rebecca. I can flit now.
-Just Iike a real vampire.

1063
01:36:53,242 --> 01:36:56,007
Oh, Larten, you did it.

1064
01:36:56,482 --> 01:36:58,689
You stuck your neck out for him.

1065
01:36:58,762 --> 01:37:01,891
You'd think a vampire would know better
than to stick his neck out.

1066
01:37:03,362 --> 01:37:05,046
I am proud of you.

1067
01:37:08,602 --> 01:37:14,689
AII those who vote for making Darren
a member of the Cirque raise your hands.

1068
01:37:21,082 --> 01:37:23,164
-One hand, Evra.
-Damn it.

1069
01:37:26,162 --> 01:37:29,086
It's done. He will stay.

1070
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:36,852
So we get to stay.

1071
01:37:38,482 --> 01:37:40,405
Not for Iong, I'm afraid.

1072
01:37:40,762 --> 01:37:42,491
You know, Crepsley, it's okay.

1073
01:37:45,242 --> 01:37:49,042
It's weird. I spent so much time wishing
that none of this would have happened

1074
01:37:49,122 --> 01:37:53,172
and that we never would have been
to the Cirque in the first place.

1075
01:37:55,122 --> 01:37:58,888
But now I really can't imagine my Iife
happening any other way.

1076
01:38:02,402 --> 01:38:03,847
Dawn's coming.

1077
01:38:05,202 --> 01:38:08,729
I had something made for you.
It's in your tent.

1078
01:38:08,802 --> 01:38:10,406
A Iittle gift.

1079
01:38:12,002 --> 01:38:14,209
And it's Mr Crepsley.

1080
01:38:19,402 --> 01:38:22,770
Because you told me to throw you.
Well, I'm sorry.

1081
01:38:24,242 --> 01:38:28,452
You did it, man.
Once a general, always a general.

1082
01:38:28,842 --> 01:38:31,368
I couldn't have done it better myself.

1083
01:38:31,642 --> 01:38:33,246
At nightfall, we Ieave with the boy.

1084
01:38:35,962 --> 01:38:37,612
I suppose we should tell him.

1085
01:38:38,842 --> 01:38:42,005
No, Iet's give him one day to rest.
He's earned it.

1086
01:38:44,802 --> 01:38:47,692
Sometimes life does seem
all planned out,

1087
01:38:47,762 --> 01:38:49,605
like there's no choice in the matter,

1088
01:38:50,362 --> 01:38:51,488
but that's an illusion,

1089
01:38:51,562 --> 01:38:53,246
Speakers. Tasty.

1090
01:38:55,002 --> 01:39:00,133
My name's Darren Shan, and I don'tjust live
with a bunch offreaks, I am one, too,
