1
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,587
You know, sometimes it seems
like life is all planned out.

2
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,689
There's no choice
in the matter.

3
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,293
We're all gonna end up in the same
place, whether we like it or not.

4
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,828
But sometimes things
aren't so simple.

5
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,132
You can end up hurting the
people you love the most,

6
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,001
betraying the people you
want to come through for.

7
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:13,006
That's not me.
That's my best friend, Steve.

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,575
We've been best friends
since third grade,

9
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,912
when he punched this kid, Billy Utsch,
for slamming a locker door on my head.

10
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:23,717
That's me. I"m Darren
Shan, and this is my story.

11
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,521
Oh, and, trust me, spending
this much time in a coffin

12
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,756
was never part of my plan.

13
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,124
Guess I'm just lucky.

14
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,256
Up until recently,
my life was pretty good.

15
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,360
I was popular enough.

16
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,864
I got good grades, 'cause
my allowance was tied to it.

17
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,834
A's! I love you.
I love you.

18
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,469
Yeah, that's the boy.
That's the boy.

19
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,104
Hey, you.
What's up, D?

20
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,040
And I had
some cool friends.

21
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,708
Hey, what's up?

22
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,877
Uh,
not including that dude.

23
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:41,215
I mean, we were friends in fifth
grade, but he'd become kind of a freak.

24
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,383
See, that used to
matter to me.

25
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:48,488
There was one thing in my life
that was a bit insane, one friend.

26
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,190
Hey.
My best friend.

27
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,092
Let's cut, all right?
What?

28
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,061
No, we're here.
Class is starting, man.

29
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,696
All right, folks.

30
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,866
What you got for me?

31
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,568
Okay, listen, I cannot
deal with that jerk today.

32
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:06,707
All right, Mr. Perfect, come on,
take a risk. Take a risk. Come on!

33
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,950
So, hey, I'm thinking about
moving to Mexico. You want to go?

34
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,318
Yeah, sure. Why not?

35
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,387
Yeah, you're not going
anywhere, Mr. Perfect.

36
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,090
Oh, shit.

37
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,494
Hey, man, I bet you can't hit that
light from all the way back here.

38
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,531
What? No, we're
gonna get busted.

39
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,366
"Steve, we're gonna
get busted. "

40
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,671
Hey!
Rock. Come on.

41
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:43,410
And so the Mutually Assured
Destruction policy of the Cold War

42
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,680
was just that. Mad.

43
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,485
What the heck is that?

44
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,290
I'm so sorry.

45
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,226
It's that Steve.
It's that damn Steve.

46
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,460
Uh...

47
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,063
Did Darren tell you he got
an A on his math test?

48
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,599
Yes, he did, honey.
Go to your room.

49
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,368
You are not going to be
friends with that Steve anymore!

50
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,070
Mom, I'm not
five years old.

51
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,272
You can't tell me who I can
and can't be friends with.

52
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,208
You are on
a good path, Darren,

53
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,610
and that Steve is knocking
you right off that path.

54
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,878
What path?

55
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:21,215
The path to a happy,
productive life.

56
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,953
To a good college, a great
job and a family of your own.

57
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:30,691
A happy, productive life.
College, job, family!

58
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,493
College, job,
family!

59
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,695
And one day, if you're really lucky,

60
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,431
you'll be standing here yelling
at a teenager of your own!

61
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,666
College, job,
family!

62
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,769
College, job, family!

63
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:47,341
College, job, family!
It's not that hard!

64
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,109
Darren,
are you listening?

65
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,211
So, wait. You...

66
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:54,715
What, you told your parents you're
not gonna be friends with me anymore?

67
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,584
Yeah, but, I mean,
it doesn't mean anything.

68
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,887
We're still like
best friends.

69
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,523
Okay, like what,
secret best friends?

70
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,126
Yeah, kind of.

71
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,629
I mean, no, it's like...

72
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,397
Look, I don't care
what they say.

73
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,732
Bullshit.

74
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,568
You do care what they say.
You do whatever they say.

75
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,036
That's just who you are.

76
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,906
You never stand up for
yourself or anybody else.

77
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,408
Maybe your parents
are right.

78
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,144
Maybe you shouldn't be friends
with me. I'm nothing. I'm garbage.

79
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,046
You're not garbage.

80
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,116
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

81
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,446
Whoa!

82
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:03,217
"Cirque du Freak. One night only.
The world's greatest freak show.

83
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,818
"Five hundred years. "
What the heck?

84
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,286
Dude, that
looks awesome.

85
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,623
I can't go, though.
I'm grounded for two months.

86
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,626
Right. And we're also
not friends anymore.

87
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,631
What's this?

88
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,301
A freak show?
This is illegal.

89
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,338
I hope you weren't thinking
of attending this.

90
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:29,610
Because the idea of taking
a group of disgusting,

91
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:35,182
weird, deformed people and exploiting
them for money... Not in our town.

92
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm assuming no one in this
class would actually go to this.

93
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,585
Hey. You know that means something
when the moon looks like that.

94
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,287
I read about it...

95
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,055
In one of your
vampire books?

96
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:16,957
I should explain.

97
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,860
Steve was obsessed
with vampires,

98
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,230
and I, on the other hand,
was obsessed with spiders.

99
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,501
I don't know why. It was just like
it was in our blood or something.

100
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,239
"Back in three seconds"?

101
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,243
One, two, three.
It's been three seconds.

102
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:41,481
Uh...

103
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,650
Okay.

104
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,919
I guess they want money.

105
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,792
Hey, I need two
tickets, please.

106
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,563
Hey! Hey!

107
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,067
Hey, come on. I gave you the
money, give me the ticket.

108
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,602
Ow! Whoa!

109
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,705
Holy crap!
God, what was that?

110
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,076
Hey, come on!

111
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,812
And it's gone.

112
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,314
You okay?
Yeah.

113
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,053
Hello?

114
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,829
Are you boys 21?

115
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,432
Are you 21?

116
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,801
Say yes.

117
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,572
Yeah.
Yeah.

118
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,509
Good. You don't have
a tendency towards panic,

119
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,881
sudden cardiac arrest or
crippling anxiety, do you?

120
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,551
Say no.

121
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,887
No.
No.

122
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,591
All right, then.

123
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:04,665
Go ahead in.
Show is about to start.

124
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,453
Welcome.

125
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,922
Welcome to the
Cirque du Freak,

126
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:33,694
the oldest continuously operating
freak show in the Western hemisphere.

127
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,562
We have toured
for 500 years,

128
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:39,466
bringing the bizarre to
generation after generation.

129
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,070
May I present the Wolfman!

130
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,249
No sudden noises.

131
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,658
Dude, he totally just
scratched his balls.

132
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,540
No!

133
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:23,877
Call an ambulance!

134
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,546
It's okay.
That's not necessary.

135
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,851
Good boy.

136
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,320
And stay.

137
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,334
Ladies
and gentlemen,

138
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,471
the enchanting recycling
queen, Corma Limbs.

139
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:57,211
And now our resident hunger
artist, Alexander Ribs!

140
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:03,851
Freaky-freak,
freak for freak freak.

141
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:07,521
Oh, look, a candy corn.

142
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,091
And next, Gertha Teeth!

143
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,631
And Rhamus Twobellies!

144
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,601
I have arrived!

145
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,757
Hey, nice bike!

146
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,262
Come on.
That is so rude.

147
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,166
And next,
Evra the Snake Boy!

148
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,554
Stay, Bippo.

149
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:18,659
So, I'm Evra Von Britow,
and we are Serpentine.

150
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,828
Who's "we"?

151
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:24,765
There'll be some CDs for sale in the
lobby immediately following the show.

152
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,607
Bippo! No!

153
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,809
Bippo, drop it,
spit that out!

154
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:38,412
Yes, I'm glad you're all enjoying
this so much. It's awesome.

155
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,914
Evra, please
be professional.

156
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,984
It's not my fault.
I just want to play music.

157
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,452
We'll discuss it later.

158
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,720
But...

159
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:48,589
And now,

160
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,226
the voluptuous,
the exotic,

161
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,997
the insightful
Madame Truska!

162
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,742
Do we have someone brave
enough to be my assistant?

163
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,310
Over here.
Oh, yeah.

164
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,145
Come on. Come on.

165
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:13,981
You.

166
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,775
Who are you?

167
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,115
My name is Fred Smith.
I'm from out of town.

168
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,469
Larten, finish your act quickly,
and let's leave this town early.

169
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,338
What? I have someone
here tonight.

170
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,607
Ready for more?

171
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:16,610
Larten Crepsley
and Madam Octa!

172
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:21,148
Don't go on.
I have a foreboding.

173
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,217
You always have
a foreboding, beautiful.

174
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,818
Larten!

175
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,326
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

176
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,695
I am so excited to be here
in anonymous small town

177
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,864
which used to have character
but is now just a bland suburb

178
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,366
filled with chain stores
and surrounded by slums.

179
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,235
It really is a pleasure
to be here.

180
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,536
And I am so honored that

181
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:46,406
blah, blah, blah and so on and
so forth, et cetera, ad nauseum.

182
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:50,210
I'm afraid I have some
unfortunate news, however.

183
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,281
I had hoped to present my usual
act, but my spider, Madam Octa,

184
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,718
seems to have escaped from her
cage and is currently missing.

185
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:01,588
Use caution when retrieving your
belongings from beneath your seats.

186
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,358
She is very poisonous.

187
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,659
But not to worry.

188
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:10,631
Tonight I will perform for you
some startling illusions.

189
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,202
First, a rabbit from a hat.

190
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,608
This is Madam Octa.

191
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:27,080
Interesting fact, one bite from
this spider means certain death.

192
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,918
But don't worry.
As long as I stay calm...

193
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:32,553
She's beautiful.

194
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,789
If I could just get
my flute, that usually...

195
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,397
Darren. His name's
not Larten Crepsley.

196
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,433
It's Vur Horsten.
He's a vampire.

197
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,203
I saw his painting
in one of my vampire books.

198
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,509
It's him. He's got
the same scars,

199
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,577
the same hair,
the same everything.

200
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,047
You seriously think
he's a vampire?

201
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,282
Yeah.

202
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,434
May I have my spider
back, please?

203
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,874
Now, boys,
vampires don't exist,

204
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,444
but if one did and he
thought someone knew,

205
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,747
he might smother them
in their sleep.

206
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,018
That's it! Show's over!

207
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,520
It's Mr. Kersey.
Come on, let's go.

208
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,157
By order of the Health Inspector,
this theater is shut down!

209
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,992
Good Lord, not again.

210
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:22,896
Welcome to the Cirque.
What seems to be the problem?

211
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:25,365
We don't want you
filthy people here.

212
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,700
That's not the problem.

213
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:31,538
The problem is you are exploiting
these poor people for profit.

214
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:35,876
Thank you. Thank you so
much for looking out for us.

215
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:39,513
So you gonna let us move
in with you? Give us jobs?

216
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,682
Freak!

217
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:46,420
So clumsy. I felt like a
manatee. It felt terrible.

218
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,554
No.

219
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,194
Octa.

220
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,369
Anyone here?

221
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:06,106
Whoa.

222
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:36,136
Hey, Octa. I'm Darren.
I'm a big fan.

223
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:53,587
We can speak in private.
It's the only...

224
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,760
We can talk in private.
The police have left now.

225
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:02,196
So, this is what you've
been doing with your life.

226
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,197
You didn't
like the act.

227
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:04,331
I'm insane.
I'm insane. I'm insane.

228
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, I saw the
spider bit coming.

229
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,303
Everybody's a critic.

230
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,906
It's not easy to hold an
audience's attention these days.

231
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:16,944
To us and Charna's Guts.
To us and Charna's Guts.

232
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,448
Did you see that
fingernail moon tonight?

233
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,650
The first one
in 50 years.

234
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,887
Yes. I noticed it.

235
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:31,158
Look, Vincent's dead.

236
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,361
Murdered. Sucked dry
by one of them.

237
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,833
They're after us, man. They're
after us. They're after us!

238
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,768
Those damn Vampaneze!
They're gonna pick us off.

239
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,804
First Vincent,
then you, then me.

240
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,606
Why me before you?

241
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,809
Well, because I'm the toughest,
and they'll save me for last.

242
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,777
Oh. Of course,
I forgot.

243
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,813
Well, what about
the Vampire Council?

244
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,515
They must have something
to say about Vincent.

245
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:58,519
Yes. They say good riddance.
They're a bunch of wimps now, Larten.

246
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,421
They'll do anything to avoid
a war with the Vampaneze.

247
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:06,026
There are no real generals left, hombre.
You and I were the last of the Mo-Freakins!

248
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,529
And to top it off,
Tiny's back.

249
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,733
Mr. Tiny?
Back from the other side?

250
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:16,703
Yes! Just last week he
was at the Council Library,

251
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:18,906
messing with
the Book of Souls.

252
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:20,607
He's trying
to destroy us all!

253
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:23,577
Megalomaniac!
That man's a megalomaniac!

254
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:39,159
And those murderous,
scumbag Vampaneze,

255
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,396
they're up to something, too,
and it's all connected.

256
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,598
It's all connected.
I can feel it!

257
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:47,901
Come with me.
We can avenge old Vincent.

258
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,136
Kill us some Vampaneze!

259
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,737
No. I'm sorry.

260
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,673
No? Why?

261
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:55,776
I'm done fighting.

262
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:59,279
I left that life for a reason.
I'm just a vaudevillian.

263
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,482
It's a simple life,
and I like it.

264
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,117
Steve.

265
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:08,188
I know who you are. I know
what you are, Vur Horsten.

266
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:13,927
Who sent you? The Apocalypse
Monger? The Blood Barons?

267
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:16,029
No... No one. I... No
one sent me. I just...

268
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,365
I have these vampire books,
and I saw a painting of him

269
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,300
with some girl in,
like, 1819.

270
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:23,804
It said that she broke up with him
when she found he was a vampire.

271
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,240
Did you hear
that, Gavner?

272
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:29,276
Missy broke up with me
because I was a vampire.

273
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:32,446
Funny, I always thought it was
the only thing she liked about me.

274
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:34,515
Let the kid go.
Let him go.

275
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:38,619
Now, are you
mentally unfit?

276
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:42,089
Didn't you hear me
threaten you at the show?

277
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:44,391
I did.
It was awesome.

278
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:50,531
You see, I want this. I want
you to make me into a vampire.

279
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:54,568
I mean, vampires, they
don't take crap from anybody.

280
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:56,336
They live by their
own set of rules.

281
00:23:56,403 --> 00:23:59,373
It's true they do have their
own rules. We wrote some of them.

282
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,377
Yes, and one of them is
children can't become vampires.

283
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,611
Look, look, blood.

284
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:06,980
Blood.

285
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:10,384
You see, Gavner,
blood.

286
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:15,689
Look, if you
become a vampire,

287
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:18,592
you have to leave your
friends and your family.

288
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:21,328
It's deeply depressing.
Trust me.

289
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,364
Now get out of here.

290
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,071
I haven't seen
my dad in years.

291
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,275
My mom is drunk
all the time.

292
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:38,579
I absolutely hate my life.

293
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:43,717
I never actually said it
before, but it's the truth.

294
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:48,522
This is what
I was meant for.

295
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,725
What you're
meant for?

296
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,163
Well, if that's the case,
let's test your blood.

297
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:57,331
No. No.

298
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,573
Who sent you here?
Your blood tastes of evil.

299
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,612
You can never
be a vampire.

300
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,481
What?

301
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,517
I have what, bad blood?

302
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:20,120
I'm never gonna
forget this.

303
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,824
One day, I promise you,
I will hunt you down.

304
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,159
And what?

305
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,462
Kill me?

306
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:33,367
Do you know how easily I could
kill you? I could do it tonight.

307
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:37,104
I could knock you out and
lay you in front of a bus,

308
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,405
and no one
would ever know!

309
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:42,843
Calm down. Save that stuff for
the enemy. He's just an idiot kid,

310
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:45,579
who should be
leaving right now

311
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,081
while he still can.

312
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,255
You're out there, man.

313
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:58,492
All right.
One for the road.

314
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,930
I'm headed back
to the Mountain

315
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,334
to try to convince those old cowards
to stand up against the Vampaneze.

316
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:11,972
Gavner, if we kill one
of them, it means war.

317
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,609
Wouldn't that
be a shame?

318
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:21,381
Poor old Vincent.

319
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,486
You've been awfully
quiet under there.

320
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,009
Get in.

321
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:14,501
Thanks. Thanks,
I really needed a ride.

322
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:17,638
Oh, absolutely,
absolutely delighted.

323
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,343
Are you the one
known as Steve?

324
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:28,949
No, I'm the one
known as Darren.

325
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,318
I actually had a bike.

326
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,655
But I'll just get it
tomorrow in the daylight.

327
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:38,125
No need.
It's in the trunk.

328
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:42,362
Now, if I
may ask, Darren,

329
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:48,368
do you believe in the
immutability of the human soul?

330
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:51,472
The what?

331
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:54,541
So, he knows nothing
of souls, does he?

332
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,911
Knows only
of blood, huh?

333
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:01,982
The pulsing, the
delicious, the ruby red.

334
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:12,626
Wow, wow, you know what? You
can just let me off right here.

335
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:14,728
What's the rush?

336
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:19,333
After all, didn't we save you
from the scary, scary vampire?

337
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:25,873
Doesn't act like
leadership material.

338
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,409
Acts more like a bag
of blood. Are you? Huh?

339
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:30,611
Bag of blood?

340
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,880
Shows how much
you know, Murlaugh.

341
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,482
I think he reeks
of potential.

342
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,918
Ow!
Sorry.

343
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,621
Souvenir.

344
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,429
We all have
a destiny, Darren.

345
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,100
And with a few simple tests,
we can find out what yours is.

346
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:57,404
Wonderful to
meet you, Darren.

347
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:01,041
It's like looking
in a mirror.

348
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:12,653
Darren!

349
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,289
We'll be in touch.

350
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:37,177
Freaky dream.
Freaky. Freaky.

351
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:46,320
Hey. Hey, I'm gonna try
to get you some food, okay?

352
00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:50,057
Just hold on one sec. I'm gonna go get
some flies from the window sill, okay?

353
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,726
Hey. Why have you
been acting so weird?

354
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:55,996
I'm not acting weird.

355
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:56,997
You were just talking
to your backpack.

356
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:58,098
What?

357
00:29:58,132 --> 00:29:59,833
No, I wasn't.
Darren, yes, you were.

358
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,568
I wasn't. Let me... Just
let me see it a second.

359
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,270
You see? It's just my
backpack. Seriously, stop it.

360
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,606
Hey, give me my backpack,
man. Hey, just let me see it.

361
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,943
Holy shit! That's...
That's the...

362
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:13,247
Yeah, I went back to the theater after
the show and I kind of borrowed it.

363
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:16,083
You stole from a vampire? Do
you realize you're a dead man?

364
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:17,317
Shh!
You're a dead man!

365
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:18,719
He's never gonna find me.

366
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,187
Okay, just...

367
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:24,625
Wait a second. When did you
go to Vur Horsten's room,

368
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:26,493
and what did you see?

369
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,331
All right,
I saw everything.

370
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:34,034
Steve, are you crazy? Why would
you want to become a vampire?

371
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:37,805
Listen, you can't understand.
You have everything.

372
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,575
What do I have?
A secret best friend?

373
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,080
Hey, leave it
in there, okay?

374
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,515
It's fine.
I want to see it.

375
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:53,921
Be careful. Hey, be careful,
okay? Be really careful.

376
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:00,160
This thing's even
more hideous close up.

377
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,261
Can you just put it
back now, please?

378
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,377
Okay,
I need the pipe.

379
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:20,914
GIRL: I got a B-minus
in history.

380
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:22,850
No!

381
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,488
Oh, my gosh,
what is that?

382
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:41,768
Move!

383
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:42,936
Steve! Wait!

384
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,038
What's going on?

385
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,520
Move! Get out of
the way, idiots!

386
00:32:01,622 --> 00:32:04,625
Watch out! Move!

387
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:07,327
Hey! Steve, don't!

388
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,999
Now I got you!
Hold still!

389
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:16,203
What's the matter with you?
Whose side are you on?

390
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,845
Hey! No! Hey!

391
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,458
GIRL: Guys, look,
it's in his shirt!

392
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:42,563
Get it off me!

393
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,097
GIRL: Oh, my God!

394
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:25,639
So what have you come to
steal from me this time? Thief!

395
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:28,142
Nothing. Nothing.

396
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:33,046
Look, Octa bit my best friend,
Steve, and he's in the hospital,

397
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:35,215
in a coma,
because of me.

398
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:38,252
And I was wondering
if you had an antidote.

399
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:39,620
I do.

400
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:40,754
Thank you.

401
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:43,257
But I only have
a couple doses left.

402
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:46,727
Why should I waste any
on some little psychopath?

403
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:48,829
Please, I'm begging
you, okay?

404
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,231
Look, I'm really sorry
I stole Octa.

405
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,768
I don't know what came over
me. I never steal things.

406
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:56,303
Why not?

407
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,205
Because it's wrong.

408
00:33:58,238 --> 00:34:00,507
So then you've learned
a valuable moral lesson.

409
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:01,508
Yes, I have.

410
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:04,978
And you'll never do anything
wrong again, as long as you live.

411
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:06,146
No, I won't.

412
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:09,383
You see? Now you're
a thief and a liar.

413
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,919
What did
Mr. Tiny want?

414
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:13,487
Mr. Tiny?

415
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:15,222
The fat man
in the limousine!

416
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:20,394
I don't know, something about
souls and... And destiny.

417
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:22,095
And he knew
where I lived.

418
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:25,766
Looks like you're in deep
shit, my larcenous friend.

419
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:29,136
Mr. Tiny doesn't just take
a random interest in people.

420
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:33,140
And the people he does take an
interest in wind up dead or worse.

421
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:39,146
What's worse than dead?

422
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:41,515
Oh.

423
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,884
Lots of things.

424
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:52,593
All right. I'll do it.
I'll make you a bargain.

425
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:57,264
You'll become my assistant. I'll
turn you into a half vampire.

426
00:34:57,297 --> 00:35:00,467
You'll be able to go out in the
daylight, very useful for me.

427
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,804
You'll do chores for me and
guard my coffin on the road.

428
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:07,474
And in return, I'll try and
keep Mr. Tiny away from you.

429
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:10,377
Oh, and I'll save
your stupid friend Steve,

430
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,413
despite the fact that
he threatened to kill me.

431
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,219
You'll save Steve?

432
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:20,287
Why not?

433
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:28,195
If I became a half vampire,
would I have to kill people?

434
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:30,864
Interested, huh?

435
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:35,502
Vampires don't kill the people
they feed on. Vampaneze do.

436
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:39,439
Big source of controversy, war
for about 80 years, then a truce,

437
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:42,576
getting ugly again,
apparently. But time's wasting.

438
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,915
Want to become a vampire?

439
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:52,352
It's a lonely life,
but there's lots of it.

440
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,656
I can't make that
decision right now.

441
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:01,261
Do you wanna go home and
ask your mommy and daddy?

442
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:04,998
Do they make all the decisions
for good little boys like you?

443
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,767
No, they don't.

444
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,905
Poor Steve doesn't
have much time left.

445
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:23,217
Fine, I'll do it. To save my
friend, not for any other reason.

446
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,786
So get the antidote.

447
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:27,087
Right here.

448
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,091
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

449
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,359
First things first.

450
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,329
Let's test your blood.

451
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,967
What are you doing? I'm not gonna bite you
in the jugular. I could kill you that way.

452
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,668
Show me your hands.

453
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:46,340
Ow!

454
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:48,208
Mmm.

455
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:52,880
You have good blood. This will
work. All right, hold up your hands.

456
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,982
We're going
to exchange blood.

457
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,150
That's creepy.

458
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,552
I know. But that's
how it's done.

459
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:11,365
This may hurt when
it gets to your heart.

460
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:25,646
I feel cold.

461
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,016
Lick your fingers.

462
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:41,895
Whoa, is that like vampire
power? Do I have super-spit now?

463
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:45,399
Yes, you have super-spit.
The rest will take a while.

464
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,169
The rest of what?
What will I be able to do?

465
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,904
Can I, like, turn into a bat and stuff?

466
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,873
No, that's bullshit.

467
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:56,443
Now hop on my back.
We're going to flit.

468
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:57,778
We're gonna what?

469
00:37:57,878 --> 00:38:00,113
Just shut up
and hop on my back.

470
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:13,427
You held your
breath, right?

471
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,662
Did I not tell you
to hold your breath?

472
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:16,997
Oh...

473
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,132
Sorry.

474
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:24,872
Hold on.

475
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:26,974
Why didn't we just
take the elevator?

476
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,976
I get claustrophobic.

477
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:31,778
Strange, huh, given
where I sleep every night.

478
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:35,415
But somehow when it's my own
confined space, it's different.

479
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,887
He looks horrible. Can you
give him the antidote, please?

480
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:46,360
She really
didn't like him.

481
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,364
Be careful.

482
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:02,376
Hey, what are you doing?

483
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:06,947
Shh.

484
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:20,194
That's it, right?
He's gonna be better now?

485
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:21,261
That's it.

486
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:30,838
You are insufferable.

487
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,206
Back! Stay back!

488
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:33,240
Code blue...

489
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:36,143
You have no idea how
ridiculous you look right now.

490
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:37,277
Code blue...

491
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:40,314
All right. If you want to pretend
this isn't happening, fine.

492
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:43,584
But being a vampire takes
skill. What is a code blue?

493
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:45,185
Code blue, code blue...

494
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:47,821
Try not to do something
stupid like kill your family.

495
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,924
Code blue, code blue,
room 519, stat.

496
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:52,960
You are not supposed
to be in here!

497
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:55,896
Code blue. All available
staff please report to room...

498
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,037
It must have hurt.

499
00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:05,139
Yeah, it hurt.

500
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:07,941
It wasn't...
It wasn't fun.

501
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:09,109
It's great
you're back.

502
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:10,244
Yeah.
We missed you.

503
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,247
Well, well, well,
Steve is back, huh?

504
00:40:13,313 --> 00:40:17,317
So, Steve, what
you got for me?

505
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:30,564
Stay away from those
brownies. They're for dessert.

506
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:32,599
Okay.
No brownies.

507
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:33,634
Next...

508
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:48,949
Hey, Darren, do you think that this
outfit looks better on her, or this?

509
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,620
What's going on?

510
00:40:57,858 --> 00:41:00,527
You look weird.
Darren.

511
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:02,729
Darren!

512
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,568
Sorry.

513
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:11,538
Sorry, I... I was just
pretending to be a vampire.

514
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:20,714
Nice room.

515
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:24,384
Some excellent reading
material you have here.

516
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:27,087
Thought this was all
on the Internet now.

517
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:28,755
Mine's blocked.

518
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:29,756
Hmm.

519
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,761
Don't... No, don't
do that. Don't cry.

520
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:37,798
Honestly. Stop, stop.
No.

521
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:39,399
I'm not crying.

522
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,268
Of course not.
That's what...

523
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:45,906
Look, I don't want to hurt
people, okay? I'm not like you.

524
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:48,175
I was this close away
from killing my sister.

525
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:52,179
Perhaps you should have thought
of that before you stole my spider!

526
00:41:54,114 --> 00:41:57,451
Look, I'm sorry,
but you can't stay here.

527
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:58,952
You're going to
have to leave them.

528
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,189
Like forever?

529
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:03,557
Like forever.

530
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,928
It's time to admit that
to yourself, Darren.

531
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,938
But you can't
just leave.

532
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:20,674
You're going to
have to die first.

533
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,285
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

534
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:32,386
Hmm?

535
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,790
Hi. Hi.

536
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:42,863
Hey, I just wanted to say that you
guys are really, really good parents.

537
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:47,201
You're doing a great job, and I'm
sorry for not doing all my chores

538
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:49,369
and for complaining
so much.

539
00:42:50,704 --> 00:42:53,407
And I love you
guys a lot.

540
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:55,142
We love you,
too, sweetie.

541
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,188
Bye, Annie.

542
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,863
How old were you when
you became a vampire?

543
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:20,667
Twenty. It was 1803,
the third of May.

544
00:43:21,835 --> 00:43:24,905
I'd just been left by my
fiancée, Hesther Collins.

545
00:43:25,506 --> 00:43:28,475
I thought she was the most
beautiful girl in Baltimore.

546
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:31,979
I saw her again 60 years
later. She was an old crone,

547
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:36,049
but my heart still
beat like a jackrabbit.

548
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:41,155
Wow, dumped, huh?

549
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:44,525
So big, bad, old Crepsley became
a vampire 'cause he got dumped?

550
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,462
Have you ever
been dumped?

551
00:43:50,597 --> 00:43:51,965
Yeah.

552
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:55,102
Then perhaps you should
be more sympathetic.

553
00:43:55,235 --> 00:43:58,238
Here it is.
Drink up.

554
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,086
My lips are numb.

555
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,188
Good.

556
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:19,326
I've got pins and
needles in my hands.

557
00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:21,728
Excellent. That means it's working.

558
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,302
Nice night,
actually.

559
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:32,506
Is that the Little Dipper or the
Big one? I can never remember.

560
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:35,242
Sorry about that.

561
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:38,612
I had to do that or they would never
believe you were dead. Don't worry.

562
00:44:38,745 --> 00:44:40,747
There's no damage
to your spinal cord,

563
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:43,350
and I'll sneak into the funeral
home and fix your broken neck.

564
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:46,954
Oh, and sorry about
this next part.

565
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:04,805
Darren,

566
00:45:06,273 --> 00:45:09,977
I hate you so much for leaving
me here with these idiots.

567
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:25,259
Darren.
Hey, Shan!

568
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,462
Asswipe, are you in
there? Darren! Steve.

569
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:32,399
Okay, time out, time out. Not
about you. We're all feeling grief.

570
00:46:23,016 --> 00:46:24,218
Wake-y, wake-y.

571
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:27,321
Here.
Fill that hole.

572
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:31,058
I can't do that. I'm all cramped
up. My legs are still numb.

573
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:32,593
Can you feel this?

574
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,361
Ow! What the heck?

575
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:41,101
Do you smell
a rotting corpse?

576
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:42,536
Ha, ha, very funny.

577
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:44,805
Get back in the grave.

578
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:46,106
I'm not getting
back in the grave.

579
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:47,841
Don't argue
with me. Get in.

580
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:48,942
No.

581
00:46:57,718 --> 00:47:02,389
Hello, old friend. Old
Crepsley. How's the scar?

582
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:05,559
Shall I give
you another?

583
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:57,711
Hello,
bag of blood.

584
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:00,881
You're coming with me.

585
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,123
Run!

586
00:48:24,438 --> 00:48:27,508
You come with Murlaugh now.
You're one of us.

587
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:30,577
Not one of those
filthy vampires.

588
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:33,147
Let me go!

589
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:36,416
Where are we going?

590
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:45,492
Hold your breath.

591
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,194
What? No, no,
no, no, no, no.

592
00:48:58,705 --> 00:48:59,740
Let's go!

593
00:48:59,807 --> 00:49:01,074
Not yet!

594
00:49:06,513 --> 00:49:08,315
Don't look behind you.

595
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,257
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God! Are you all right?

596
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:19,860
Come here!

597
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:27,367
Breathe.

598
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:30,270
GIRL 1: Right over
the plate!

599
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:32,539
GIRL 2: Oh, my God.

600
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,007
Do you know
those guys?

601
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:37,444
Are we there yet?

602
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:38,512
Almost.

603
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:45,152
Where are we?

604
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:47,287
The Cirque's
winter campgrounds.

605
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:49,323
You'll be safe here
if they let you stay.

606
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,525
Try to fit in.

607
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,295
Come on.

608
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:56,530
So all the freaks
live here?

609
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,432
Yes.

610
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:06,673
Don't stare.

611
00:50:11,912 --> 00:50:14,581
It's really...

612
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,728
You want to go to my tent? You
know, we can rehearse in my tent.

613
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:29,863
I'm not gonna
rehearse in your tent.

614
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:33,200
It'll be great, you know. You
always have fun in my tent.

615
00:50:38,939 --> 00:50:40,541
Wait here for me.

616
00:50:41,608 --> 00:50:43,243
Well, I was
thinking about it.

617
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:44,945
I mean, you're not gonna be
able to do this forever, right?

618
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,014
If you set everything up,
so I can just fill it out.

619
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:50,584
Neutral. The Cirque has
always remained neutral.

620
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:52,786
That's how it has
survived all these years.

621
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,189
You'll still
be neutral.

622
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:58,859
I'm not trying to drag you into anything.
I'm trying to keep myself out of it.

623
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:01,728
And why exactly do you
think Tiny wants this boy?

624
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:03,397
I'm not sure yet.

625
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:05,566
But whenever Mr. Tiny
wants something,

626
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:08,268
I make it my policy to try
and keep him from it.

627
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:10,537
That's a
dangerous policy.

628
00:51:16,543 --> 00:51:19,179
Hey, what are you doing?
That's Mr. Tall's tent.

629
00:51:20,614 --> 00:51:22,316
Hi, I'm Darren.

630
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:23,750
What are you
doing here?

631
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:26,487
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

632
00:51:27,221 --> 00:51:29,256
You can listen
if you want.

633
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:33,760
How much does
the boy know?

634
00:51:33,894 --> 00:51:35,329
Nothing.

635
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,732
He's waiting by my tent if
you want to speak with him.

636
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:42,836
You know, Larten, the thing you
might not realize about children is,

637
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:47,074
they don't always do
what they're told!

638
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:51,311
Rebecca. Don't you have
work you should be doing?

639
00:51:51,311 --> 00:51:54,681
Yes. Sorry, Mr. Tall. It won't happen
again. I mean, I don't eavesdrop on people.

640
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:55,883
It was his idea.

641
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,317
I didn't make you
do anything.

642
00:51:57,384 --> 00:51:59,086
Well, you couldn't make me
do anything if you tried.

643
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:00,254
Oh, really, huh?

644
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:01,488
Enough. Rebecca,

645
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:05,259
I would like you to take
Darren to Evra's tent.

646
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:08,228
Evra will be his roommate
while he stays with us.

647
00:52:09,029 --> 00:52:12,499
You'll have to work, Darren.
Everybody here pitches in.

648
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,234
That's fine.

649
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:18,839
I actually worked for my dad's
office a couple of weeks this summer.

650
00:52:18,872 --> 00:52:20,841
I did photocopies, so...

651
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:29,249
This is on a temporary basis, Larten. I
can't endanger everybody for your sake.

652
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,118
Of course.
Thank you.

653
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:35,088
So, what are you doing here
anyway, with all these freaks?

654
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:38,392
Why? Do you have
a problem with freaks?

655
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,496
No, I mean, they kind
of freak me out, but...

656
00:52:42,629 --> 00:52:45,232
They freak you out.
Clever, really clever.

657
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:49,503
Well, I really have to get back to
work. Harkat can show you the way.

658
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:52,773
Harkat, take Darren
to Evra's tent, please.

659
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:01,181
Well, you better
follow him.

660
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:07,654
Okay, see you sometime.

661
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:15,129
No, I saw what you did to my friend
Steve's hand at the theater, buddy.

662
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:23,670
Dude, I'm not giving
you my hand, okay?

663
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,244
I'm sorry. Here.

664
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,248
Harkat!

665
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:38,385
You have to stop biting people, or
no one will want to be around you.

666
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:44,758
You.

667
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:49,963
Death.

668
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:54,635
Redemption. Despair.

669
00:53:57,204 --> 00:54:00,140
Triumph. Disaster.

670
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:04,211
What did I say?

671
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:08,048
"Death, redemption,
despair, triumph, disaster. "

672
00:54:09,716 --> 00:54:14,388
Well, don't worry about it. Go
ahead, Harkat. Take him to Evra's.

673
00:54:14,888 --> 00:54:16,623
And no more teeth.

674
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,902
You mean, this is it?

675
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:34,108
Chill in the laundry for a
sec. There you go. Good girl.

676
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:39,279
Good snake. Love you.

677
00:54:42,516 --> 00:54:46,353
So, I guess we're gonna be
roommates. So how are you f'd up?

678
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:49,056
F'd up?
Freaked up.

679
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:50,757
How... What kind
of freak are you?

680
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:53,660
Oh, I'm not a freak.
I'm normal.

681
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:55,929
You're normal?

682
00:54:56,029 --> 00:54:57,097
No. I mean,
I'm half vampire,

683
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:58,832
but I'm completely
normal.

684
00:54:58,832 --> 00:55:01,635
You're a half vampire,
but you're normal.

685
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:04,571
I like that.

686
00:55:05,572 --> 00:55:09,209
And don't worry about, like, if I'm
gonna drink your blood or anything.

687
00:55:09,276 --> 00:55:12,446
I'm not gonna drink
anyone's blood.

688
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:17,050
What a relief. Okay,
this isn't awkward at all.

689
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:19,386
This is your corner
of the tent. All right?

690
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,588
You do not cross over to
any other part of the tent,

691
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:24,158
except to enter and
exit the tent. All right?

692
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:28,362
And you are never, ever to touch my
stuff, especially this stuff over here.

693
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,431
This is my
recording studio.

694
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:33,967
Oh, cool. Yeah, I... I actually
used to have a drum set,

695
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,404
but, you know, my parents
made me give it away, so...

696
00:55:37,438 --> 00:55:39,239
Mmm.
Yeah.

697
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,608
Well, there are
no parents here.

698
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:45,279
Oh...

699
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:51,084
Yeah. Shedding,
itches like crazy.

700
00:55:51,618 --> 00:55:53,687
You should actually go wash your
hand off before you get pink eye.

701
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:59,226
Did you forget to tell me you were going
to go away for a couple of days? Huh?

702
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,529
I can't believe you're treating me
like this. I've been worried sick.

703
00:56:02,596 --> 00:56:04,164
Why can't you just
get a cell phone?

704
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,799
Because vampires
don't need cell phones.

705
00:56:05,966 --> 00:56:09,937
"Vampires don't need this,
vampires don't need that. "

706
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,172
I'll tell you what
vampires need.

707
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,375
They need to listen. Didn't I
tell you that I had a foreboding?

708
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:18,545
And what do you do? You
show up here with that kid.

709
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:21,315
It's been a long night. I
just flitted across two states.

710
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:23,383
I think I'll just hit
the pine early.

711
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:24,785
No, wait.

712
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:30,124
You don't love me
anymore. It's my beard.

713
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:34,862
You know how I feel about you. I
just don't want to outlive anyone.

714
00:56:34,928 --> 00:56:39,399
It's depressing watching people you
care about grow old while you stay young.

715
00:56:40,768 --> 00:56:42,402
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror lately?

716
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:45,038
You're no kid.

717
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:49,443
Oh, no, no. I'm still
angry at you. Mmm-mmm.

718
00:56:49,643 --> 00:56:51,578
Mmm-mmm.

719
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:56,016
Your mouth says no,
but your beard says yes.

720
00:56:56,784 --> 00:56:58,118
I can't believe
he's gone, man.

721
00:56:58,118 --> 00:56:59,653
I know. He was
like my best friend.

722
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:01,121
No, he was
my best friend.

723
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:02,723
I knew him first.
So what?

724
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,658
I thought he
was a dick.

725
00:57:04,825 --> 00:57:06,360
What?
What?

726
00:57:06,693 --> 00:57:08,128
Dude.
Oh, my...

727
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:10,898
Here, get up before one of the
teachers see you. That kid's psycho.

728
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:20,507
Mr. Leonard, what you got for
me here? Finish the quiz already?

729
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:33,787
MR. TINY: Careful.
Whoa!

730
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:37,157
The first step
is a big one.

731
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:41,895
Oh, I know. You miss
the one known as Darren.

732
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:47,267
You feel betrayed, abandoned.
You're a loyal friend,

733
00:57:48,235 --> 00:57:49,503
unlike him.

734
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:53,440
Darren was
a loyal friend.

735
00:57:53,474 --> 00:57:55,075
Oh, really?

736
00:57:55,509 --> 00:58:00,047
What if I told you he's still
alive? He's taken your place,

737
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,717
stealing your dreams. Oh, I know.

738
00:58:03,717 --> 00:58:07,154
You dream of killing people,
drinking their blood.

739
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:11,859
You dream of leading a
great, bloodthirsty army.

740
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:13,694
Who the hell are you?

741
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:15,963
I'm Mr. Tiny.

742
00:58:16,029 --> 00:58:17,297
Are you a vampire?

743
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:20,868
No, I'm not a vampire.
I'm not a Vampaneze.

744
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:23,537
I'm an aficionado.

745
00:58:24,705 --> 00:58:28,208
I want to see
a marvelous war.

746
00:58:28,308 --> 00:58:30,744
What do you want
from me, you freak?

747
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:35,582
I'm not a freak.
I despise freaks.

748
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:38,886
Can a freak travel back and
forth between life and death?

749
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:40,354
I think not.

750
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:44,191
Can a freak create new life from
rotting flesh and dead souls?

751
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:45,325
Please.

752
00:58:45,426 --> 00:58:50,731
Can a freak bring about the
apocalypse and rule the world?

753
00:58:51,465 --> 00:58:52,699
No.

754
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:59,673
Sadly, neither can I, not
without help. I need a champion.

755
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:04,978
One of two boys,
two dear friends.

756
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:10,284
And by the way,
I love your DNA.

757
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:18,759
You care
for a pancake?

758
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:20,928
No, I can't. I'm...

759
00:59:20,994 --> 00:59:22,596
We know
what you are.

760
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:25,099
You're bad news.
That's what.

761
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:30,404
But nothing I couldn't deal
with in just about two bites.

762
00:59:31,772 --> 00:59:34,641
Don't mind him. He
just needs some Ex-Lax.

763
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,176
Welcome to
the Cirque.

764
00:59:36,176 --> 00:59:37,544
Thank you.

765
00:59:37,978 --> 00:59:40,447
Would you like to eat one of
my hands? I can grow them back.

766
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:41,648
Yeah, they
are delicious.

767
00:59:41,715 --> 00:59:43,650
Hey, Vampelina.

768
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,385
Come on, we gotta go
clean out Wolfie's cage,

769
00:59:45,486 --> 00:59:49,423
and then Crepsley left, like, a
list of stuff for you to do for him.

770
00:59:49,456 --> 00:59:50,824
It looks like you're
Crepsley's bitch now.

771
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:52,126
Evra.
What?

772
00:59:57,898 --> 01:00:00,834
Okay, so you guys are
gonna do it. And go.

773
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:12,112
I can't believe the tiny
people eat these rats.

774
01:00:12,246 --> 01:00:13,781
They'll eat you
if you don't watch out.

775
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:15,415
Don't!

776
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:34,067
So where do you
come from anyways?

777
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:47,915
I guess I could probably,
like, open this up,

778
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:51,185
and you'd probably turn
into dust or something, huh?

779
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:54,488
You wouldn't like that
now, would you, Dracula?

780
01:00:54,521 --> 01:00:55,989
Who's the boss
now, baby?

781
01:00:57,057 --> 01:01:01,061
Okay. Concentrate now.
How hard can it be to flit?

782
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:17,444
Ow. Perfect.

783
01:01:36,563 --> 01:01:38,098
What's the point?

784
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:48,475
I'm just not that
much of a freak.

785
01:01:48,509 --> 01:01:50,210
Gertha, you're
a major freak.

786
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:58,685
Sorry, you're
not my type.

787
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,055
Do you ever
miss your family?

788
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:05,893
Not really.

789
01:02:05,926 --> 01:02:08,796
I joined the Cirque when I
was two. Two days old, that is.

790
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:12,499
Mr. Tall found me in a dumpster.
So I guess this is my family.

791
01:02:14,768 --> 01:02:18,305
Dumpster baby,
oh, dumpster baby

792
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:21,775
I wanna be your
dumpster baby

793
01:02:24,311 --> 01:02:25,312
No.

794
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:46,600
Hey, this is Steve.
You know what to do.

795
01:02:49,903 --> 01:02:51,038
What are you doing?

796
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:52,206
Oh, nothing.

797
01:02:53,407 --> 01:02:54,842
May I see it?

798
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,578
Yeah, I guess.

799
01:02:57,744 --> 01:02:59,480
I've always wanted
one of these.

800
01:03:00,714 --> 01:03:02,850
Hey! What are
you doing?

801
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:05,452
We must be very careful
who we talk to, Darren.

802
01:03:21,735 --> 01:03:24,404
Go to your tent
and stay there with Evra.

803
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,723
Yes. I have returned.

804
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,463
I have returned!

805
01:03:50,531 --> 01:03:55,135
Unacceptable. Unforgivable.
To blood a child?

806
01:03:57,404 --> 01:04:00,007
By the way, is he drinking
enough blood?

807
01:04:00,073 --> 01:04:02,042
He's not drinking
any blood.

808
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:03,377
Not drinking blood?

809
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:06,947
Crepsley, don't you know
he has to? He must.

810
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:11,385
Or perhaps you're worried
he'll love it too much.

811
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:15,722
He might be
Vampaneze at heart.

812
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:17,424
You'd like that.

813
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,660
You've been favoring them
for the last 100 years.

814
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,631
On the contrary, I'm strictly
neutral, like the Cirque.

815
01:04:24,665 --> 01:04:26,767
Correct, Mr. Tall?

816
01:04:28,502 --> 01:04:29,770
Correct.

817
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:33,006
Then tell us
why you want him.

818
01:04:33,073 --> 01:04:36,343
It's one of your self-fulfilling
prophecies, isn't it?

819
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,079
Well, one does dream
of the cataclysm.

820
01:04:41,615 --> 01:04:45,119
This truce may
not last forever.

821
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:48,222
There might be new leaders.
New blood, as it were.

822
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:52,826
Perhaps a boy,
a bloodthirsty boy.

823
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:56,430
It's all been written.

824
01:04:56,497 --> 01:04:59,566
Then why do you care? You're
up to something, Desmond.

825
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:03,670
Me? I may
write the script,

826
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:07,641
but the characters have a
tendency to do as they please.

827
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:11,712
You, for example, have an
unseemly amount of free will.

828
01:05:11,845 --> 01:05:17,184
Now, Mr. Tall, will you be
reasonable and give me the child?

829
01:05:17,684 --> 01:05:21,588
I've always done what you ask.
I'm not one to cause trouble.

830
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:29,296
But I need to think about all this.
I won't make a decision hastily.

831
01:05:29,296 --> 01:05:32,900
You know, I always get
what I want, in the end.

832
01:05:42,676 --> 01:05:45,946
MR. TINY: Keep an eye
on him, my pets.

833
01:05:56,824 --> 01:06:00,360
Hey, dude. Sorry,
we're on our own today.

834
01:06:01,328 --> 01:06:03,664
Rebecca's back in
the costume shop.

835
01:06:24,485 --> 01:06:26,620
Hey.

836
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:29,890
I'm here for
Crepsley's cape.

837
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,225
It's that red one
with, like, the...

838
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:33,427
I know what Crepsley's
cape looks like.

839
01:06:33,527 --> 01:06:35,462
What do your
friends want?

840
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:38,932
Hey! Beat it!

841
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,704
Does this trailer have, like,
a back entrance or something?

842
01:06:43,737 --> 01:06:47,207
Yeah, it's right back there.
Wait, your pants are ripped.

843
01:06:47,241 --> 01:06:51,278
Take them off.
Try this pair on.

844
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:54,581
They fit.

845
01:06:54,648 --> 01:06:55,816
Yeah.

846
01:07:00,954 --> 01:07:04,024
So, you know,
Rebecca, you...

847
01:07:04,992 --> 01:07:08,462
You never really told me what
you're doing here with the Cirque.

848
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:11,265
Well, Darren,
since you ask,

849
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:14,234
I'm a monkey girl.

850
01:07:15,536 --> 01:07:16,503
You're a what?

851
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:17,638
What?

852
01:07:17,738 --> 01:07:20,874
Nothing, I thought you just
said you were a monkey girl.

853
01:07:20,941 --> 01:07:22,443
Well, oh, yeah.

854
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:25,379
Yeah.

855
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:31,285
What does that mean?

856
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:35,422
It means I have a tail. Do
you have a problem with that?

857
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:40,494
No, because... 'Cause
you're joking, right?

858
01:07:40,561 --> 01:07:45,032
No, I'm not joking. I keep it wrapped
up because people kept stepping on it.

859
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,768
Oh.

860
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:49,103
Yeah.

861
01:07:49,136 --> 01:07:52,639
Anyway, your pants
look really good.

862
01:07:52,973 --> 01:07:57,377
Yeah, I know. You picked
it out. That's really good.

863
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:05,786
Shush!

864
01:08:06,553 --> 01:08:09,289
Thanks. They've been
spying on me all day.

865
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:15,662
So if you were interested in a
girl, okay, and she had like...

866
01:08:16,296 --> 01:08:20,300
Like a tail, let's say,
would that be a problem or...

867
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:22,369
Well, I'll put it
to you this way.

868
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:24,138
If you had told me a
couple hundred years ago

869
01:08:24,204 --> 01:08:27,007
that I would someday be dating a
woman with bristles on her chin,

870
01:08:27,074 --> 01:08:30,677
I would have told you you
were insane. But here we are.

871
01:08:32,913 --> 01:08:36,784
By the way, there's a new rule.
You're not to leave camp anymore.

872
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:38,285
Why not?

873
01:08:38,352 --> 01:08:39,620
Because I said so.

874
01:08:41,822 --> 01:08:45,159
You're not my dad. You can't
just tell me what to do...

875
01:08:48,195 --> 01:08:50,531
When was the last time
you were in a fight?

876
01:08:50,697 --> 01:08:51,832
Uh...
Second grade.

877
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,735
Steve's usually the one
that gets in all the fights.

878
01:08:54,802 --> 01:08:57,271
Well, Steve's not
here to fight for you.

879
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:59,440
And what if
I wasn't, either?

880
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,343
What if you were alone in the dark
and someone wanted to kill you?

881
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:06,213
Rip out your heart
and drink its blood?

882
01:09:06,346 --> 01:09:07,548
What then?

883
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:12,719
Crepsley?

884
01:09:15,222 --> 01:09:16,757
Crepsley,
come on.

885
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:21,762
Crepsley?

886
01:09:27,634 --> 01:09:28,702
You're hurting me.

887
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:31,905
What are you going
to do about it? Well?

888
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:40,114
You're soft. You're a soft little boy.

889
01:09:40,147 --> 01:09:43,383
They're looking for you, Darren.
This is not the schoolyard.

890
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:47,654
You either have to learn to fight or
to run. So which is it going to be?

891
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:02,302
Good. But don't use your fist.
You have something better.

892
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:05,672
Use your fingernails
like a dagger. Watch.

893
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:13,914
Try it. Extend your fingers
and follow all the way through.

894
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:15,849
Use all your strength.

895
01:10:21,422 --> 01:10:22,623
Ow!

896
01:10:23,357 --> 01:10:25,759
God, I think
I broke a nail.

897
01:10:25,793 --> 01:10:27,161
You broke a nail?

898
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:32,166
You need blood. We have
a lot of work to do.

899
01:10:37,538 --> 01:10:38,872
Blood will have blood.

900
01:10:38,939 --> 01:10:40,274
Blood will have blood.

901
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:43,644
Are you ready, you filthy
little pig, to be stuck?

902
01:10:43,811 --> 01:10:46,046
Do you renounce living
with the living?

903
01:10:46,713 --> 01:10:49,216
Are you prepared
to die with the dead?

904
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:17,578
Steve, what the hell
are you doing?

905
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:19,179
Well, hi,
Mr. Kersey.

906
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,515
I just wanted to
stop by real quick

907
01:11:21,648 --> 01:11:24,118
and actually apologize
for the way, you know,

908
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:25,285
I've been acting
in school lately.

909
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:27,488
It's 3:00 a. m.

910
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:30,524
My teachers troubled
me when I was a lad.

911
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:38,632
They caned me and caned
me till I was bloody.

912
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:45,939
Then one day, I took up
a broken switch,

913
01:11:46,707 --> 01:11:49,643
and I rammed it in
my teacher's eyeball.

914
01:11:52,579 --> 01:11:54,047
Who are you?

915
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:55,482
I'm his mentor.

916
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:03,223
You see, Steve?

917
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:05,325
Ow!

918
01:12:07,194 --> 01:12:09,963
This is what Crepsley
wants us to live with.

919
01:12:17,905 --> 01:12:21,975
So, Mr. Kersey,
what you got for me?

920
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:25,312
So you really
don't kill people?

921
01:12:25,312 --> 01:12:26,380
No, Darren.

922
01:12:27,214 --> 01:12:31,085
You just sedate them and feed
a little bit, and then leave.

923
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:33,120
I actually developed
the method.

924
01:12:33,153 --> 01:12:36,757
Well, two other vampires
and I, Gavner and Vincent.

925
01:12:37,624 --> 01:12:40,494
We were the freaks of the vampire
world. No one understood us.

926
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:42,563
And then they
started to realize

927
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:45,432
that if you don't kill your prey
every time like a little piggy,

928
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:50,204
then you don't get hunted down by irate
townspeople with pitchforks and torches.

929
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:55,242
And now half the vampires feed this
way, and the other half hate us.

930
01:12:57,945 --> 01:12:59,279
Quiet now.

931
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:09,990
Whoa! How'd
you do that?

932
01:13:10,657 --> 01:13:13,794
Vampires can exhale a gas
that knocks out humans.

933
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:14,895
Really?

934
01:13:14,928 --> 01:13:18,165
Drink some blood, you'll be
able to do all kinds of things.

935
01:13:18,232 --> 01:13:23,070
Now, we just make a small incision
in his shoulder. Right here.

936
01:13:25,706 --> 01:13:27,541
And then you
take a sip.

937
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:32,312
Don't worry. He won't become a vampire
unless you exchange blood with him.

938
01:13:32,413 --> 01:13:36,683
Go ahead. I had some a couple of
days ago. It's very refreshing.

939
01:13:36,784 --> 01:13:38,952
No, I'm not gonna
drink human blood.

940
01:13:39,019 --> 01:13:42,589
Hurry up, before someone sees
us. We haven't got all night.

941
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:45,159
I'm not going to.

942
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:52,766
You have to drink blood, Darren, or
you'll die. It's as simple as that.

943
01:13:57,004 --> 01:13:59,440
Damn kid is gonna
get himself killed.

944
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:04,278
Larten, what made
you blood him?

945
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:08,115
I needed someone
to run errands for me.

946
01:14:08,148 --> 01:14:11,218
Oh, come on, you didn't
need to blood him for that.

947
01:14:11,251 --> 01:14:14,288
I had a feeling if I didn't,
something terrible would happen to him.

948
01:14:14,388 --> 01:14:18,959
Something terrible? As
opposed to becoming a vampire?

949
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:23,831
I think you're
getting lonely.

950
01:14:23,864 --> 01:14:28,635
After 200 years of living alone, why
on earth would I suddenly become lonely?

951
01:14:28,769 --> 01:14:32,673
I don't know. Midlife
crisis? What is it?

952
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:35,042
They're here.

953
01:15:31,065 --> 01:15:32,332
Watch out!

954
01:15:47,314 --> 01:15:48,982
That's not fair.
Back!

955
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:51,151
Darren,
get out of here!

956
01:15:51,685 --> 01:15:52,753
Duck!

957
01:15:58,158 --> 01:15:59,259
Move.

958
01:16:03,797 --> 01:16:04,932
Get in.

959
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:08,001
Psst.

960
01:16:42,703 --> 01:16:45,172
Hey! Hey!

961
01:16:46,507 --> 01:16:49,009
Look, I don't even
like the Wolfman,

962
01:16:49,176 --> 01:16:52,646
but that don't mean you can come
in here and beat up on a freak!

963
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:54,581
You're messing with the
wrong sideshow, baby!

964
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:56,250
I'll bite your
damn noses off!

965
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:58,619
I'm gonna ram
my head up your ass.

966
01:16:58,786 --> 01:16:59,820
Stop!

967
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:02,456
Stop!

968
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:06,160
There'll be
no fighting here.

969
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:12,599
How dare you enter this campground?
The Vampire Council will hear of this.

970
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:19,473
Tell the little vampire
it's time to come home.

971
01:17:20,274 --> 01:17:24,478
It's almost dawn. I have a spare coffin
here. I suggest you get some rest as well.

972
01:17:24,611 --> 01:17:26,847
Aren't we gonna, like, double
back and attack them or something?

973
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:28,148
Do you want
to stay alive?

974
01:17:28,215 --> 01:17:32,319
You're not even drinking blood yet.
I doubt you'd be much good in a fight.

975
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:34,121
Well, what if they
hurt someone?

976
01:17:34,254 --> 01:17:36,590
People can look
out for themselves.

977
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:39,326
You've been
looking out for me.

978
01:17:39,693 --> 01:17:41,361
Why?

979
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:44,298
Why? Because I'm
an idiot, that's why.

980
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:47,801
Only an idiot would spit
in the eye of Mr. Tiny.

981
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:51,205
Because he doesn't just kill
people, he brings them back, as well.

982
01:17:51,271 --> 01:17:54,808
And when I finally die,
I plan on staying dead.

983
01:17:56,076 --> 01:18:00,380
Life may be meaningless, but
death I still have hope for.

984
01:18:01,548 --> 01:18:03,784
Life isn't
meaningless.

985
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:07,855
Tell me that after 200 years
of it, kid. Good day.

986
01:18:17,731 --> 01:18:18,832
You know
I never liked him.

987
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:19,967
I never did,
either.

988
01:18:20,134 --> 01:18:21,769
I told you
when I first saw him.

989
01:18:21,902 --> 01:18:23,504
Should never
have let him in.

990
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:24,772
We all know
it's his fault.

991
01:18:24,938 --> 01:18:28,075
I just can't believe he has the
nerve to walk around in here.

992
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:29,777
That poor Rebecca.

993
01:18:33,947 --> 01:18:37,451
They took her?
Where?

994
01:18:38,452 --> 01:18:43,323
I don't know, but they said
to tell you to come home.

995
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:49,897
Which, of course, you're not gonna
do. Wait, Darren, Darren. No, buddy.

996
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:51,098
Those guys are huge, man.

997
01:18:57,771 --> 01:19:00,007
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Shan.
Hey, Annie.

998
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,042
Steve. What are
you doing here?

999
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:07,347
Well, you know, I've been thinking.
You guys probably really miss your son.

1000
01:19:07,381 --> 01:19:11,718
And my mom is drunk half the time, so
she doesn't really notice I'm there.

1001
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:15,089
How about you
guys adopt me?

1002
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:19,626
No interest?

1003
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:23,297
Told you they
wouldn't go for it.

1004
01:19:24,098 --> 01:19:25,065
Hmm.

1005
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:27,167
How disappointing.

1006
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:32,306
So few "people" have the
parenting instinct the way I do.

1007
01:19:37,878 --> 01:19:39,546
Ready for the prom?

1008
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:54,728
Make new friends,
but keep the old

1009
01:19:54,762 --> 01:19:58,031
One is silver
and the other's gold

1010
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:02,202
Make new friends,
but keep the old

1011
01:20:02,236 --> 01:20:05,472
One is silver
and the other's gold

1012
01:20:55,556 --> 01:20:59,793
Hey, Octa. Say goodbye
to Crepsley for me, okay?

1013
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:02,062
Tell him I'm sorry
but I have to go home.

1014
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,002
It's time, isn't it?

1015
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:34,261
Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven, 27.

1016
01:21:34,395 --> 01:21:35,562
Twenty-seven.

1017
01:21:35,763 --> 01:21:38,232
All right, no, no.
Twenty-eight.

1018
01:21:38,265 --> 01:21:40,067
May I borrow
a couple of these?

1019
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:45,172
Don't forget to bring them
back, though. Both of them.

1020
01:21:45,906 --> 01:21:48,776
You're in danger,
terrible danger.

1021
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:51,078
Your life and soul
are in jeopardy.

1022
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:53,947
What did I say?

1023
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:55,282
Nothing. Something
about the weather.

1024
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:58,752
Chance of thunderstorms tomorrow.
Don't worry. I'll stay indoors.

1025
01:22:29,516 --> 01:22:32,052
Applause! Applause!

1026
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:37,658
Look. Little vampire.

1027
01:22:39,493 --> 01:22:40,694
Take a bow.

1028
01:22:40,994 --> 01:22:42,763
Where are my family
and my friends?

1029
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:43,831
Please.

1030
01:22:43,864 --> 01:22:47,434
Must have patience.
Will spoil the show.

1031
01:22:52,506 --> 01:22:55,375
Do you like? Does Murlaugh have talent?

1032
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:59,246
No? What do you
know about talent?

1033
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:06,920
Where is Crepsley?

1034
01:23:09,223 --> 01:23:11,658
Too bad for Crapsley.

1035
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:15,162
Because he will
miss the show!

1036
01:23:16,663 --> 01:23:21,335
Here is freak all
wrapped up tight.

1037
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:29,143
And here are beloved family
members. Applause. Applause.

1038
01:23:31,578 --> 01:23:35,149
Hello, beloved son.
Hello, loving parents.

1039
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:39,720
Hello, cute little sister.
Four bags of blood.

1040
01:23:41,155 --> 01:23:42,589
Don't worry.
You're all gonna be okay.

1041
01:23:42,656 --> 01:23:44,892
Will be better than okay.

1042
01:23:45,626 --> 01:23:48,996
Will be delicious!

1043
01:23:50,531 --> 01:23:52,833
But now, may I present

1044
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,270
reunion with oldest friend
and blood brother,

1045
01:23:56,336 --> 01:23:59,473
with he that shall
one day rule us all,

1046
01:23:59,573 --> 01:24:04,044
the one known as Steve.

1047
01:24:05,245 --> 01:24:07,281
Thank you!
Thank you!

1048
01:24:08,882 --> 01:24:10,150
Steve.

1049
01:24:10,684 --> 01:24:11,885
You're alive?

1050
01:24:13,821 --> 01:24:16,690
You know, that was really an
asshole thing for you to do.

1051
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:19,960
Make your whole family and your
secret best friend go through all that?

1052
01:24:20,094 --> 01:24:22,529
Look, I didn't mean
to hurt anybody, okay?

1053
01:24:22,629 --> 01:24:24,364
Who cares what
you meant to do?

1054
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:27,434
What you did was take my
place. That was my dream.

1055
01:24:29,136 --> 01:24:31,438
Steve, what are
you doing with him?

1056
01:24:31,472 --> 01:24:33,407
Who? Murlaugh?

1057
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:36,143
Come on, man, he's
not as bad as he looks.

1058
01:24:36,143 --> 01:24:39,079
You know, for one thing, he didn't
say I had bad blood like Crepsley.

1059
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:41,381
And for another thing,
he didn't lie to me.

1060
01:24:41,482 --> 01:24:43,984
And you know what?
They think I'm awesome.

1061
01:24:44,118 --> 01:24:48,188
They say I have a destiny,
or whatever. Look at you.

1062
01:24:49,223 --> 01:24:52,593
Who wants to be a vampire
anyways? Vampires suck.

1063
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:54,294
Vampaneze rule!

1064
01:24:54,528 --> 01:24:56,029
Juicy!

1065
01:24:56,163 --> 01:24:58,832
First guy I killed,
Mr. Kersey.

1066
01:24:58,866 --> 01:25:01,802
Blood just gets me going,
you know what I mean?

1067
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,739
I wouldn't know. I
haven't been drinking any.

1068
01:25:07,174 --> 01:25:11,578
I know you. Always trying to look
like Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes all the time.

1069
01:25:12,312 --> 01:25:14,281
I bet you'll, like,
resist drinking blood

1070
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:16,016
and resist drinking
and resist drinking it,

1071
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:18,852
at the last second become
this total bloodhound!

1072
01:25:20,921 --> 01:25:22,289
All right, man,
here's the deal.

1073
01:25:22,356 --> 01:25:25,559
See, the fat guy, he still wants you on
the team, and despite everything else,

1074
01:25:25,592 --> 01:25:28,429
you are still my best friend.
So I'll tell you what,

1075
01:25:28,495 --> 01:25:31,498
I'll make you a deal that
might just save your ass.

1076
01:25:31,598 --> 01:25:33,901
If you kill your family,
I'll let the freak go.

1077
01:25:35,736 --> 01:25:38,005
Wait. My bad,
that's backwards.

1078
01:25:38,038 --> 01:25:40,507
If you kill the freak,
I'll let your family live.

1079
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:43,010
What? Let the
juicy one go?

1080
01:25:43,243 --> 01:25:46,647
Hey, look, man, it's part of
the plan. Talk to Mr. Tiny.

1081
01:25:48,282 --> 01:25:49,950
So what do you say?

1082
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:53,253
Just kill her. Oh, yeah, you
got to drink her blood, too.

1083
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:55,756
You can do her in
with this.

1084
01:26:21,648 --> 01:26:23,484
MR. TINY: Wait!

1085
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:27,688
Allow him in,
gentlemen.

1086
01:26:28,889 --> 01:26:30,824
I want to see
this play out.

1087
01:26:31,959 --> 01:26:36,163
Man, that was pathetic. You're
totally weak. You need some blood.

1088
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,467
Murlaugh.

1089
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:41,635
Finally.

1090
01:26:45,406 --> 01:26:47,374
And we thought you
weren't gonna show.

1091
01:27:41,128 --> 01:27:43,063
I hate spiders!

1092
01:28:01,648 --> 01:28:02,916
Darren. Come here.

1093
01:28:04,985 --> 01:28:06,120
Okay.

1094
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:11,392
Is that your tail?

1095
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:12,760
Well, yeah.

1096
01:28:12,993 --> 01:28:15,262
I'm really sorry I got you
involved in this, okay? I...

1097
01:28:15,329 --> 01:28:18,599
Please stop staring.
So you really need blood?

1098
01:28:19,566 --> 01:28:21,001
Yeah.
All right.

1099
01:28:22,236 --> 01:28:25,305
Can you just take
a little? Go ahead.

1100
01:28:26,073 --> 01:28:27,574
I'm offering it to you.

1101
01:28:29,143 --> 01:28:32,813
Thanks. But I just
can't lose it.

1102
01:28:32,846 --> 01:28:33,781
What?

1103
01:28:34,248 --> 01:28:36,517
Whatever's still
making me human.

1104
01:28:37,184 --> 01:28:42,222
Darren, being human's not about
what you are. It's about who you are.

1105
01:29:23,964 --> 01:29:24,965
No.

1106
01:30:11,378 --> 01:30:12,613
He's all yours, lad.

1107
01:30:32,266 --> 01:30:34,968
Good.
Right in the heart.

1108
01:30:36,703 --> 01:30:39,540
So fair and foul a day
I have not seen.

1109
01:30:43,077 --> 01:30:45,646
My people aren't
weak like yours.

1110
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:48,816
They will avenge me,
Crepsley.

1111
01:30:54,188 --> 01:30:58,992
The truce, 100 years,
is over.

1112
01:31:01,161 --> 01:31:03,063
The war begins.

1113
01:31:11,872 --> 01:31:14,875
Marvelous. Magnificent.

1114
01:31:14,908 --> 01:31:19,313
Really. Bravo. Bravo.

1115
01:31:19,713 --> 01:31:23,817
It's just like you said.
We started the war.

1116
01:31:28,455 --> 01:31:32,459
It won't start a war if
nobody hears about it.

1117
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:41,535
Young people today are
so difficult to control.

1118
01:31:53,047 --> 01:31:54,014
I hate you.

1119
01:31:54,081 --> 01:31:55,115
I hate you!

1120
01:31:55,182 --> 01:31:57,017
I became a vampire
to save you, Steve.

1121
01:31:57,084 --> 01:31:58,385
Thanks.

1122
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:14,568
Go ahead. Just do it!

1123
01:32:28,048 --> 01:32:29,717
That's enough, boys.

1124
01:32:34,455 --> 01:32:36,623
Steve, come with me.

1125
01:32:37,257 --> 01:32:38,358
Not before
I kick his...

1126
01:32:38,459 --> 01:32:40,394
You will behave!

1127
01:32:41,795 --> 01:32:45,032
It's not time for you to fight. Not yet.

1128
01:32:46,433 --> 01:32:48,469
What does that mean?

1129
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:50,738
Oh, it's all written
down in a book.

1130
01:32:51,638 --> 01:32:53,974
You do read books,
don't you?

1131
01:33:00,781 --> 01:33:02,015
Steve.

1132
01:33:05,352 --> 01:33:07,154
Look, don't...
Don't go.

1133
01:33:08,822 --> 01:33:11,425
What else am
I supposed to do, man?

1134
01:33:11,492 --> 01:33:13,093
Live with you
and a bunch of freaks?

1135
01:33:14,762 --> 01:33:16,430
It's too late now.

1136
01:33:17,398 --> 01:33:19,466
I have my destiny,
and you have yours.

1137
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:24,605
How poignant. The parting
of two dear friends.

1138
01:33:25,072 --> 01:33:27,041
Such sweet sorrow.

1139
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:32,179
Then again, you will
come home to us one day.

1140
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,249
My prodigal son.

1141
01:33:35,315 --> 01:33:39,486
After all, you are
the bloodthirsty one.

1142
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:45,392
No. Just because I'm a vampire
doesn't mean I'm bloodthirsty.

1143
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:49,663
It's not about what you are.
It's about who you are.

1144
01:33:58,138 --> 01:33:59,173
Oh.

1145
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,941
I almost forgot.

1146
01:34:50,491 --> 01:34:52,159
Cover yourself.

1147
01:34:54,261 --> 01:34:56,597
You have to teach me
how to do that someday.

1148
01:34:56,597 --> 01:34:59,666
Oh, I'll teach you
everything, son.

1149
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:05,739
All my gibes and gambols. Now,
ready to go meet your people?

1150
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,226
Bye, Annie.

1151
01:35:34,201 --> 01:35:36,236
Will it work?
Hypnotizing them?

1152
01:35:37,337 --> 01:35:40,941
It works on the memories, but
not on the emotions, not really.

1153
01:35:41,975 --> 01:35:45,245
They'll always feel that
you're still alive, somehow.

1154
01:35:45,579 --> 01:35:47,281
Well, that's good,
right?

1155
01:35:47,381 --> 01:35:48,615
Is it?

1156
01:35:59,393 --> 01:36:01,562
Hey, can I ask
you something?

1157
01:36:04,865 --> 01:36:06,500
Can I kiss you?

1158
01:36:07,568 --> 01:36:12,706
Darren, I let you drink my
blood. Sure, you can kiss me.

1159
01:36:35,462 --> 01:36:38,632
Come on. We don't have all night.
I have an injured spider here.

1160
01:36:41,201 --> 01:36:44,938
All right, how are we going to do
this? I can't carry the both of you.

1161
01:36:46,073 --> 01:36:49,510
You carry Rebecca.
I can flit now.

1162
01:36:49,576 --> 01:36:51,211
Just like a real vampire.

1163
01:36:53,147 --> 01:36:55,916
Oh, Larten, you did it.

1164
01:36:56,417 --> 01:36:58,585
You stuck your
neck out for him.

1165
01:36:58,585 --> 01:37:01,789
You'd think a vampire would know
better than to stick his neck out.

1166
01:37:03,223 --> 01:37:04,925
I am proud of you.

1167
01:37:08,529 --> 01:37:10,631
All those who vote
for making Darren

1168
01:37:10,731 --> 01:37:14,601
a member of the Cirque
raise your hands.

1169
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:22,376
One hand, Evra.

1170
01:37:22,509 --> 01:37:23,644
Damn it.

1171
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,982
It's done.
He will stay.

1172
01:37:35,122 --> 01:37:36,724
So we get to stay.

1173
01:37:38,392 --> 01:37:40,327
Not for long,
I'm afraid.

1174
01:37:40,627 --> 01:37:42,296
You know, Crepsley,
it's okay.

1175
01:37:45,165 --> 01:37:48,969
It's weird. I spent so much time wishing
that none of this would have happened

1176
01:37:49,036 --> 01:37:53,006
and that we never would have been
to the Cirque in the first place.

1177
01:37:55,008 --> 01:37:58,779
But now I really can't imagine
my life happening any other way.

1178
01:38:02,282 --> 01:38:03,784
Dawn's coming.

1179
01:38:05,018 --> 01:38:08,622
I had something made for
you. It's in your tent.

1180
01:38:08,655 --> 01:38:10,290
A little gift.

1181
01:38:11,892 --> 01:38:14,128
And it's Mr. Crepsley.

1182
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:22,603
Because you told me to
throw you. Well, I'm sorry.

1183
01:38:24,104 --> 01:38:28,342
You did it, man. Once a
general, always a general.

1184
01:38:28,776 --> 01:38:31,245
I couldn't have
done it better myself.

1185
01:38:31,512 --> 01:38:33,147
At nightfall,
we leave with the boy.

1186
01:38:35,849 --> 01:38:37,551
I suppose we
should tell him.

1187
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:41,822
No, let's give him one day
to rest. He's earned it.

1188
01:38:44,691 --> 01:38:47,528
Sometimes life does
seem all planned out,

1189
01:38:47,661 --> 01:38:49,296
like there's no choice
in the matter,

1190
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:51,365
but that's an illusion.

1191
01:38:51,432 --> 01:38:53,133
Speakers. Tasty.

1192
01:38:54,868 --> 01:38:56,503
My name's Darren Shan,

1193
01:38:56,570 --> 01:44:31,972
and I don't just live with a
bunch of freaks. I am one, too.
