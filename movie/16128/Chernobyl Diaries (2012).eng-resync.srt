1
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,640
Bye, L.A.!

2
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:38,939
Here we go.

3
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,262
My friends are morons.

4
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,124
You better be careful, you might
end up in the Tower of London.

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,195
Criminal.

6
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,614
But it's gonna be you.

7
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,019
- Forget the plane.
- This is backwards, by the way.

8
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,466
And here in front of us,
we have the beautiful...

9
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,658
Danube river.

10
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,097
We're doing Prague.

11
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,237
Hi, Paul! We're at
the Tower of London!

12
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,146
Here we come, Kiev. We're
coming to see you, Paul.

13
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,273
You guys are ridiculous.

14
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,841
- Dude, it was so much fun, man.
- Yeah, I can imagine.

15
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,509
Hey, ladies! You wanna
put your stuff away?

16
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,544
- Sure.
- Some place you got here, Paul.

17
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,578
I'm never leaving.

18
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,320
Best place ever. Ain't
it right, Chris?

19
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,582
- I got it, it's fine.
- I'll take it. I got it. I insist.

20
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,683
Where are we sleeping?

21
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,118
I told you, I put a pillow
on the patio for you.

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,853
"I told you, I put a pillow
on the patio for you."

23
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,321
You're sleeping in my room! Where
do you think you're sleeping?

24
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,124
Oh, great. Even better. Some
chick still sleeping in there?

25
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,125
Quite possibly.

26
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,260
I hope you cleaned those sheets.
Or burned them.

27
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,535
I heard that!

28
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,042
- So, Kiev, huh?
- Kiev, baby!

29
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,503
I thought for sure your add
would have kicked in by now.

30
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,745
Dude, I'm telling you, man.
I don't think I'm leaving.

31
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,349
I love it here! The chicks,
they're fuckin' amazing.

32
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:28,080
They absolutely love Americans and
they are completely fucking insane.

33
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,641
Yeah, well, they have to be if
they want anything to do with you.

34
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,418
- So, Amanda.
- Yeah, okay.

35
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,053
- What? Chris!
- I knew this was coming.

36
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,120
Come on.

37
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,290
Rob literally broke up with her three
weeks before we were supposed...

38
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,559
To come out here and Natalie had
to drag her ass onto the airplane.

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,096
Perfect! Look at her.

40
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,064
She's lonely, she's in Europe.

41
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,466
Best way to get over an ex is with a fling.
I could be her fling.

42
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,368
- You're a sick son-of-a-bitch.
- I'm not sick, dude!

43
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,507
Would you stop?

44
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,972
- Do I have a shot with her?
- No, you don't.

45
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,509
- No? All right.
- Zero. Fine.

46
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,422
- I'll leave it alone.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,793
What about you and Natalie?
You guys going good?

48
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,184
It's creepy when you look
at me like that, dude.

49
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,489
Hold this.

50
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,664
Are you serious?

51
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,224
Are you serious?

52
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,863
Yeah, dude!

53
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,004
I haven't asked her yet. I'm
gonna propose in Moscow.

54
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,331
- Does she have any idea?
- Ah, well, I hope not.

55
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,675
- What about Amanda?
- No.

56
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,475
That's awesome, dude.

57
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,055
Unbelievable.

58
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,483
A fucking riot.

59
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,050
Oh, man, thank you so much.
This was such a good night.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,151
Yeah, it was.

61
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,887
Told you, man. Okay. Save it
for the apartment. Get a room!

62
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,868
Go to town, we're in Europe!
Don't listen to him.

63
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,759
- Whoa! You all right?
- Hello! Thank you, good save.

64
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,741
Watch out! These cobblestones,
they'll get you.

65
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,201
Thank you for being a good host.
We've had a lot of fun.

66
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,939
My pleasure. You enjoying
yourself in Kiev?

67
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,738
I am! Yes, it's a
beautiful little city.

68
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,379
- It's not bad, right?
- Yeah, it's great.

69
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,847
Wait till Moscow.

70
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,616
Wait until you get to Moscow.
You believe me?

71
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,847
I don't know.

72
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,385
Do you trust me? I don't trust
you in those heels. Come here.

73
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,731
- Paul. Hands off!
- Sorry.

74
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,126
- You're trouble.
- I am trouble!

75
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,998
I can't promise what's gonna happen
at the end of the road, but...

76
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,739
Don't fall.

77
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,833
Those stairs are slippery.

78
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,434
Please, lock your door tonight.
I don't trust him.

79
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,641
- Christopher.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,216
- You are visiting your brother in Kiev.
- Yeah, well, I had to chase you down.

81
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,100
I didn't know when you booked this
trip, it was a one-way ticket.

82
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,882
I missed you, buddy.

83
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,539
Yeah, I missed you too, man.
It's good to see you.

84
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,686
- How are things back home? Good?
- Yeah, things are great.

85
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,828
Mom's worried sick, of course.
You know how she is.

86
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,096
You spoken to Dad?

87
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,394
No, I, uh... no.

88
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,628
- You should call him.
- I know I should.

89
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,836
- Paul, which way should we go?
- Left.

90
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,709
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want
any trouble, seriously.

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,881
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

92
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,657
- Good night.
- Have a good night.

93
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,451
Good night. Bye-bye.

94
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,726
Come on, come on, come on.

95
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,256
- Fucking losers.
- Real friendly people here.

96
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,737
Don't worry about it. We
got a big day tomorrow.

97
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,401
Okay, I'm assuming that this is the
breakfast menu? But I don't know.

98
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,840
Excuse me, is...

99
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah, she hasn't had
her coffee yet.

100
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,273
Where's Paul? He's supposed
to help us with this.

101
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,975
I don't know, I just
want something greasy.

102
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,777
Can you just point out
something greasy, please?

103
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,451
You need the hangover special.

104
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,483
Amanda, I want to apologize for
Paul's behaviour last night.

105
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,693
Oh, please. He's fine. I mean,
I know the type, you know?

106
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,591
Just all talk.

107
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,224
Yeah, well, with him, it's
not always just talk.

108
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,460
I can handle him, I'm not too
worried about it. You know?

109
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,363
And I'm sure, deep
down in there...

110
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,732
- Very deep down, very...
- Somewhere...

111
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,835
He's a good guy, you know?
It's just an act, that's all.

112
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,703
I mean, he's related to you, baby,
and you turned out all right.

113
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,338
- That's true.
- Yeah, you're okay.

114
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,307
That's true. Just let me know if
I need to kick his ass for you.

115
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,875
- Thanks, dude. Hello!
- Morning, children.

116
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,243
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

117
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,279
- How are you?
- Fantastic.

118
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,487
So, I know I said we're
going to Moscow.

119
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,218
But I'm gonna ask you a
question, and I want an answer.

120
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,630
The answer is already no.

121
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,955
You guys ever heard
of Chernobyl?

122
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

123
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,759
Isn't that where the
nuclear disaster happened?

124
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,105
Yes. I met this really
cool guy, Uri, who's a...

125
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,871
Have you heard of
extreme tourism?

126
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,834
Somehow, I haven't, no.

127
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,168
You guys see where
this is going, right?

128
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,870
We're going to Moscow,
as we talked about.

129
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,817
Chris? Can I please finish?

130
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:51,243
So, there's this place called Pripyat.
It's a town right next to Chernobyl.

131
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,980
Uri, who is very excited to take us
there, is an extreme tour guide.

132
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,190
He's gonna show us this city
that was abandoned overnight.

133
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,892
Literally. They had no
time to take anything.

134
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,695
Factories, schools, stores, homes,
apartments, everything's still there.

135
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,626
Imagine the photo shoot you
can have there, Amanda?

136
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,963
Yeah, but, radiation
levels or something.

137
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,765
- It's probably pretty dangerous, right?
- We're only gonna be there for a day.

138
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,973
A few hours, see some cool
shit and then we split.

139
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,737
- How are we gonna get there?
- Uri's gonna take us.

140
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,172
- He's got a van.
- A van?

141
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,573
- Yeah.
- He has a van?

142
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,814
He has a van!

143
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,481
Okay...

144
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,248
Aside from the sketchy
van situation...

145
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,491
And if you promise that
this tour is safe...

146
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,417
I think it could be kinda cool.

147
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,052
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You're kidding.

148
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,222
No. I mean-I don't know.
He's right.

149
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,590
We're in Europe, we
might as well...

150
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,993
See as much as we possibly
can while we're here.

151
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:41,972
I don't know.

152
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,630
- Tell me you don't want to meet Uri.
- I don't want to meet Uri.

153
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,931
How can you say that? You
haven't even met him yet.

154
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,867
Okay, we'll take some pictures, explore
a bit, and then we'll be on our way.

155
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,246
Just as planned. Right?

156
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,205
I don't like that he's
rubbing off on you.

157
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,040
He's definitely not rubbing off.

158
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,708
You're incredible,
you know that?

159
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,109
All right, let's just settle
this by a show of hands, please?

160
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,356
Who's coming with
Paul to Chernobyl?

161
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,954
- Yeah!
- You're kidding me, right?

162
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,263
You guys are so weak.

163
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,903
All right, kids! Welcome to Uri's
extreme travel. Let's do it.

164
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,262
Welcome to Uri's extreme.

165
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,640
Uri!

166
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,736
What's up, buddy?

167
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,704
Good morning.

168
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,678
- Come in! Welcome, welcome.
- All right, man! The gang is all here.

169
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,707
- This is my little brother Chris.
- How you doing?

170
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,677
His girlfriend Natalie.
The lovely Amanda.

171
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,545
- Guys, this is Uri.
- Hi.

172
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,547
Hello.

173
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,982
So, I was telling them about
our little adventure today...

174
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,894
And Chris got
parental, as usual.

175
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,886
So I figured you'd give him
a little peace of mind...

176
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,093
Before he pisses his pants.

177
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,334
- You're feeling, uh, nervous?
- No, I'm not. I'm not nervous.

178
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,731
It's a nice shop you got here,
it's very, uh, professional.

179
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,701
Thank you. It's all mine.

180
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,803
- It's all yours, huh?
- Yeah, very nice.

181
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,468
- Yes, it's all mine.
- Well, what are you, ex-military?

182
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,136
Yes, special forces.

183
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,138
What does it matter if he's
a fuckin' magician, dude?

184
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,641
I'm just asking a
fucking question.

185
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,775
Okay. Uri, what's the plan for today?
What are we doing?

186
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:07,019
Well, this is a very
well organized tour.

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,683
I've been taking special adventurous
tourists for a while now...

188
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,753
So you should feel
very, how do you say?

189
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,098
- Special?
- Special, I like that.

190
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:22,897
Okay, so imagine, you have big city
and no one's there. All to yourself.

191
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,730
Is it safe?

192
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,144
Of course it's safe. This is
not my first rodeo, Natalika.

193
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,910
- So sorry we're late!
- We're here.

194
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,339
Hey, you guys are for
the special tour, yeah?

195
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,717
Yeah!

196
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,909
I'm Michael, this
is my viking Zoe.

197
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,112
How you doing? Chris.
Nice to meet.

198
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,947
What's up, man? I'm Paul.
Nice to meet you, buddy.

199
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,649
- Okay, we go!
- We go now.

200
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,685
- Come, come.
- All right.

201
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,085
Sweet.

202
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,820
- We didn't keep you waiting?
- No. You guys are fine.

203
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,756
Zoe, I told you!
Go with the flow!

204
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,033
So, tell me, what's up with
the whole viking thing?

205
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,361
He calls me that all the time.
I'm from Norway, so...

206
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,672
And he's my Australian
surfer dude.

207
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,539
All right, let's rock and roll!

208
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,710
Yes.

209
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,432
Yeah, buddy! Are you kidding?

210
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,814
That's what we're riding in?

211
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,423
- Might as well just... roll with it.
- Put your bags in the back.

212
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,250
First time there?

213
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,619
Pripyat? Yeah. How
about you guys?

214
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,430
Yeah. How about you guys?

215
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,695
Yes. Someone said that
it's pretty fantastic.

216
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,225
- You two sweethearts Moonin'?
- "Moonin" '?

217
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,894
- Are we what?
- Honeymooning.

218
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,929
Yeah, actually, we
are honeymooning.

219
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,331
We're just friends. Barely.

220
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,073
You're cute.

221
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,606
- Are you guys?
- Oh, yeah, we're timeless.

222
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,470
A month.

223
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,872
You guys have only been together a month?
God bless.

224
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,511
These two are
practically married.

225
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,949
- We go.
- Shotgun!

226
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,488
Thank you.

227
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,063
Anybody gets hungry,
I have beef jerky.

228
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,629
Pripyat is two hours from here, and
Chernobyl is not far from there.

229
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,863
Good time!

230
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,065
What exactly happened
in Chernobyl?

231
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:11,310
The Chernobyl disaster was a
result of failed systems tests.

232
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,872
It caused sudden power surge.

233
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,854
And reactor number four
became one with the air.

234
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,578
- One with the air?
- Vaporized.

235
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,717
It exploded.

236
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,130
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

237
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,665
Nature has reclaimed
its rightful home.

238
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,748
Here we are.

239
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,151
Welcome to Pripyat.

240
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,786
Photo.

241
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,823
We're now entering
exclusion zone.

242
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,134
How long is it safe to be here?

243
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,839
It's very safe. We'll only
be in Pripyat for two hours.

244
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,832
What is this place? Is
it like a checkpoint?

245
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,141
Looks like it.

246
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,848
Why would there be a checkpoint
at an abandoned town?

247
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,644
Tourists.

248
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,113
Okay...

249
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,978
- Let me do the talking.
- Well, you think?

250
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,653
- Put your cameras away.
- Yeah, got it.

251
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,260
Look at this guy over there.

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,601
These guys look pretty serious.

253
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,932
I don't know what they're saying,
but this guy is saying no.

254
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,470
Look at this guy.

255
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,802
What do you think is going on?

256
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,877
It's scary!

257
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,482
God, look at that guy.
He's huge.

258
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,155
- Thanks, baby.
- Come on, you.

259
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,286
Hide me so he doesn't see me.
How's that?

260
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,528
- You have a criminal soul?
- Do I look like one of them?

261
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,848
He is not letting us in today.
There's maintenance going on.

262
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,649
Maintenance work? I thought you
said this place was abandoned.

263
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,752
It is unusual.

264
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,478
Usually, they let me
know in advance...

265
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,322
...if something like this
is going to happen.

266
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,929
Wait, I thought you said everything
was gonna be taken care of.

267
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,732
- We paid for this tour, bro.
- I know, I know.

268
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,801
Don't worry.

269
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,160
There's more than one
way into Pripyat.

270
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,504
Make it happen.

271
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,847
It's so bizarre, I don't
see any birds or anything.

272
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:08,023
This must be Uri's
special entrance.

273
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,131
Paul, this looks
fuckin' sketchy, man.

274
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,702
Stop being a pussy. We came all this
way, enjoy yourself, all right?

275
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,532
It's called being sensible.

276
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,572
This is not right, you guys.

277
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,613
We're gonna end up in a
Ukrainian jail or something.

278
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,752
Come on, just think of
it as an adventure.

279
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,557
It's okay.

280
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,083
- This is the awesomest.
- Really?

281
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,395
Okay, no problem. Today we
have Pripyat to ourselves.

282
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,940
- Sweet.
- All right.

283
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,847
Here we go.

284
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,836
I was not expecting
a lake out here.

285
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,436
And there is Pripyat.

286
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:35,208
Home to the workers and
families of Chernobyl.

287
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,651
It's incredible.

288
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,683
Hold on! This is going
to be a little bumpy.

289
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:52,890
A little bumpy.

290
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,699
Oh, you're not gonna...

291
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,232
And down we go!

292
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,831
And up!

293
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,469
Oh, my God!

294
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,317
When are you putting seat
belts in this thing?

295
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,855
- Jesus.
- Or barf-bags.

296
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,151
It's ridiculous.

297
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,691
Okay. Now, I want to show
you something in water.

298
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,099
He wants to show us
something in water.

299
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,760
Thank you.

300
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,468
After you. After you.

301
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,502
- Stay close behind me.
- Like we're gonna go anywhere.

302
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,880
- Paul?
- Yeah?

303
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,145
I want you to tell me if you see
something moving in water. Okay?

304
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,914
Okay...

305
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,985
You don't want to get
your booties wet.

306
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,532
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

307
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,274
You okay? You okay, mate?

308
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,739
Funny, bugger.

309
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,741
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- He's a fucking comedian.

310
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,909
- It's jerky.
- Jerky, you jerk.

311
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,144
Hey, guys, can we go, please?

312
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,022
- Fucking got me!
- Yeah. He got me, too.

313
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,420
Oh, shit!

314
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,095
It was a joke.

315
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,290
Sorry about that.

316
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,289
Come have look at this.

317
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,462
Is this another joke?

318
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,905
No. No, come.

319
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,142
Holy cow.

320
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,900
- Don't get too close.
- Why? It's dead.

321
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,938
- It's disgusting.
- Look at the chompers on him.

322
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,115
What is that thing?

323
00:17:58,878 --> 00:17:59,948
Touch it, mate.

324
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,487
Who's the pussy now, huh?

325
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,857
- Can we go? This is disgusting.
- Keep it up.

326
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,255
Can we go? That's disgusting.

327
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,133
- That's awesome.
- And moving on.

328
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,133
See its teeth? It's cool, huh?

329
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,829
Oh, my God!

330
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,624
- Did you just make a rhyme, Uri?
- Yes.

331
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,716
Make small joke.

332
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,252
- Not to worry.
- Here is Uri.

333
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,621
So, Uri, how long has this
place been abandoned?

334
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,859
It's been 25 years. Only recently
have radiation levels gone down.

335
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,330
Man, this is crazy.
It's creepy as fuck.

336
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:57,969
We are back on main road. It's
only way in and out of Pripyat.

337
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,314
Yeah, except for your
shortcut, right?

338
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:06,814
This is where the
families Chernobyl lived.

339
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,617
- See?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,553
- These were all full at one point.
- Yes. Very sad.

341
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,831
Fifty thousand people,
families, just left.

342
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,643
Okay, hold on. Little
bump, little bump.

343
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,172
- The Ferris.
- All right.

344
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,244
- I used to love those things.
- We're here.

345
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,721
Still want to go home, Chris?

346
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,116
I'm happy we're here. Thanks.

347
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,997
- You're welcome.
- There we go. Brotherly love.

348
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,266
Guys, look at this.

349
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,146
Ah, man.

350
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,208
Okay, everyone.

351
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,882
Stay near me and you'll be safe.

352
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,112
I have geiger counter.

353
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,748
It will let us know if the
radiation levels are high.

354
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,387
That's good.

355
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,998
Levels are good.

356
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,659
Can you guys imagine this like,
full with kids? Like... playing?

357
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,800
- It's really sad, actually.
- They had no idea.

358
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,708
I mean, this is
just unbelievable.

359
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,310
I have never seen
anything like this.

360
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,449
It's like they were getting ready
for a carnival or something.

361
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,383
They were preparing for
"may day", the celebration of spring.

362
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,528
Never happened.

363
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,657
Okay, let's go. This way.

364
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,865
Can we get a photo? Uri, you
want to take it? A photo.

365
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,740
- Hey, guys?
- All right. Quick photo.

366
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,934
And new friends.

367
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,442
Okay...

368
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,215
Good.

369
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,545
It's so American.

370
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,679
In a way, it's like...

371
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,412
There was life, and it just...

372
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,834
Hey, you hear that?

373
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,072
Silence.

374
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,340
It's like nature
really has taken over.

375
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,810
One last thing.

376
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,327
- Are we going in?
- Yes.

377
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,335
What is it, babe? Whoa, Zoe.
Hey, babe, it's okay.

378
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:57,203
They usually don't come so close to town.
Must have been starving.

379
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:00,749
I reckon he's right.

380
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,618
Come in.

381
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,178
That's disgusting.

382
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,388
That's the V.I.P.  entrance.
Treatment.

383
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:12,817
Poor guy...

384
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,729
Are there any other
animals here?

385
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,700
Unlikely. Especially
during the day.

386
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:19,930
Just you.

387
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:46,655
Stop it.

388
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,630
Here's one of a thousand
apartments that were abandoned.

389
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,030
Cool.

390
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,432
The people were not even
given five minutes...

391
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,413
To collect their
personal possessions.

392
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,472
You can't take that.
It's contaminated.

393
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,342
I was just look... spot the convict.
Cheers, man.

394
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,686
It's contaminated.

395
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:19,186
For a while, people came here and
they looted through these buildings.

396
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,532
They took these things,
sold them on black market.

397
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,655
People who bought
them got sick...

398
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,296
Not knowing they were
contaminated by radiation.

399
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,899
Sorry, I was just...

400
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,198
Come, let's have a look.

401
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,166
But it's okay to be
here and breathe?

402
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,202
Yes, yes.

403
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,276
We're not here long
enough to get exposure.

404
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:47,078
Chernobyl reactor number four.
Where the disaster happened.

405
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,447
- That's pretty close.
- Have you, you been inside?

406
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:53,317
No. You can only go inside
with radiation suit.

407
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,457
Only for short period of time.

408
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,327
Here, take picture.

409
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,261
- Take a nice, romantic photo?
- All right, all right.

410
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,536
Hey, I wasn't gonna...

411
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,544
- Yeah, he was.
- This is going on the fridge.

412
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,635
That's a metaphor here,
by the way, guys.

413
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,869
Do tell.

414
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,680
- That's beautiful.
- Our love is just exploding.

415
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:16,548
Oh, God.

416
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,176
The one good thing
about the radiation...

417
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,248
Is that I'll probably
finally grow a penis.

418
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,489
These guys are funny.

419
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:25,991
I know, I know.

420
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,826
- Can you beat that kiss?
- What?

421
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,678
We should go now.

422
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,626
It's going to get dark soon, we
should get back to van before then.

423
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,857
Fuck was that?

424
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,231
Right, it's gonna be a trick.

425
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,123
Stay.

426
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,044
Fuck is that?

427
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,324
Holy shit! Go, go, go!

428
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,497
- Jesus!
- Motherfucker!

429
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,795
Oh, my God!

430
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,429
Fuck!

431
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,631
- Is everyone okay?
- Don't fucking stand there!

432
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,166
Let's go, move, move, move!

433
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,305
Go!

434
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,614
Fuck! What the fuck was that?

435
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,771
Go, go.

436
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:29,844
Black bear or it's a fucking brown bear?
Oh, Jesus!

437
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,045
- What is a bear doing here?
- Can we just get the fuck out of here?

438
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,650
- Jeez.
- Watch out for that.

439
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,221
Oh, fuck!

440
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,289
- Okay.
- Holy shit.

441
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,999
- Can we just get the fuck out of here?
- Yes.

442
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,398
- Thanks for that.
- Yeah. Don't mention it.

443
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,730
Told you it'd be
exciting, didn't I?

444
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,265
Yeah, almost getting
mauled to death...

445
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,940
By a radioactive bear from hell?
It's pretty exciting.

446
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,709
Anybody else have a
story like this?

447
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,771
- Funny.
- You okay?

448
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,149
Anyone get a photo?

449
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,813
A photo. This guy.

450
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,413
Jesus.

451
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:10,818
Bear! Bear, bear! I'm kidding.

452
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,829
That's bad.

453
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,262
So, Uri, all the animals,
they stay in the woods, huh?

454
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,295
It's very unusual.

455
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,665
I've been doing this for five years.
I've never seen anything like this.

456
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,899
It's kind of chilly
out here, huh?

457
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,403
A dog, a wolf. But
a bear, very odd.

458
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,881
- It was exciting, right?
- Yeah, mate.

459
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,220
No extra charge for bear attack.

460
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,642
Say goodbye to Pripyat.

461
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,919
- Ciao.
- Yeah, ciao-ciao.

462
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,351
Hey, Christopher?

463
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,658
Moscow! Thank you.

464
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,819
- I'll have to get your e-mail, eh?
- Yeah, for sure, dude.

465
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,289
- Catch up again? I'll be back to Kiev.
- Done, dude.

466
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,824
- It was a blast.
- It's been a pleasure.

467
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,429
Turn the heater on, buddy.

468
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,168
Pump it.

469
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,573
Give it some gas.

470
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,803
- What's up, is there gas in there?
- Yes. Half a tank.

471
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,743
Is it the starter, mate?

472
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:08,814
Has this happened before?

473
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,684
I don't suppose you guys
have triple a out here?

474
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,459
Do you have reception?

475
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,453
I haven't had reception all day, guys.
There's no kind of reception out here.

476
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,762
Look, look.

477
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,301
What the fuck could've
done that, mate?

478
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,367
That's fucking been chewed on.

479
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,901
- Wait, what's happening?
- What's going on?

480
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,333
- The wires have been destroyed.
- Chewed on.

481
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,469
What do you mean chewed on?
What, by what? An animal?

482
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,108
What kind of animal
chews on car parts?

483
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,773
Are you sure we're
out here alone?

484
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,376
Yes. You heard the soldiers this
morning, this place is off-limits.

485
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:46,651
We are here alone.

486
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,287
What the fuck is it, Michael?

487
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,217
That's the spark-plug
leads, been chewed on...

488
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,658
- Can you call someone?
- By a raccoon, a rat, or some animal.

489
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,755
But how would an
animal get in here?

490
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,823
Under the car.
Through the engine.

491
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,031
- Underneath?
- Yeah, yeah.

492
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,468
He said there aren't any around
here and all of a sudden...

493
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,447
I don't know.

494
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:15,348
Guys! Let's just shut up and
let him-we're trying to-to...

495
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:27,789
Fuck me.

496
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,604
Uri?

497
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,671
What's the plan, mate?

498
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,245
Hey, big fella? What's the plan?

499
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,746
I'm so hungry, I could die.

500
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,425
Well, this is great.

501
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,831
Gotta hand it to you. Some
fucking tour, mister.

502
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,200
- This is not my fault.
- Oh, really? Not your fault?

503
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,226
Cause last time I checked, you were
the one that drove us out here.

504
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,827
Well, if it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be here either.

505
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,496
Oh, I'm sorry to try and
show you guys some fun...

506
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,857
- While you're out here visiting me.
- Oh, yeah. Lot of fun.

507
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,074
Hey, Chris. All
right, you know what?

508
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,147
Relax.

509
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,211
- We're fine.
- We're fucking stranded out here.

510
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,042
And don't tell me to relax.

511
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,510
I swear to God...

512
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,178
This is the last time I listen to
one of your dumb fuckin' ideas.

513
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,881
Hey, you know what, Chris? Your fucking
whining isn't helping right now.

514
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:06,242
- He's got every right to be pissed.
- Okay, guys. Hey, Uri.

515
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,520
Someone has to know
we're out here, right?

516
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,694
I work alone.

517
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,934
Fucking great.

518
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,100
So, tell me, Uri.

519
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,869
What are our options right now?

520
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,567
We stay in van.

521
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,903
- Are we safe here?
- Yes, we're safe.

522
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,611
We close windows, lock doors.

523
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:32,706
In morning, I fix van, we drive up.
Or we all walk back to checkpoint.

524
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:33,844
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

525
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,612
Are you suggesting that
we spend the night here?

526
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:36,647
Okay, okay, guys

527
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,288
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have
to hike outta here, all right?

528
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,318
Uri, how far to the checkpoint?

529
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,955
- It's 20 kilometers.
- That's like 12, 13 miles.

530
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,457
Exactly. We can hike that.

531
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,734
No, no, not at night!

532
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,804
- It is not safe.
- Be quiet!

533
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,874
What the fuck was that?

534
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,954
- Are there people here?
- It's impossible.

535
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,325
It sounds like a baby.

536
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,958
- What is that?
- It's not a baby.

537
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,734
Then what the fuck is it, Uri?

538
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,733
Whoa, whoa. What's
with the gun, man?

539
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,969
- You have problem?
- Yeah. What's with the fucking gun?

540
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,348
You should all be
glad I have this.

541
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,413
Everyone stay here.

542
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,819
- A gun?
- Where is he going?

543
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:46,995
Do you trust him?

544
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,830
- Do you want to go out there with him?
- Easy, bro.

545
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,334
I don't know, it's
just that the...

546
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,024
Stay here. He'll come back.

547
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,693
- Chris, what the fuck...?
- Where's he going?

548
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,415
- Chris, I'm coming with you.
- No, I don't want you to come with me.

549
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,431
Just sit in the car and
think of another way...

550
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,002
You can fuck this
up even further.

551
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:06,207
I swear to God, Paul, it's a fucking
hazard having you as a brother.

552
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,508
Chris!

553
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,447
Chris!

554
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,311
- What's he gonna do?
- I don't know, babe.

555
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,485
- Where is he going?
- Uri, wait up!

556
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,296
I can't see him. Can
you guys see him?

557
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,240
Oh, God.

558
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,618
Chris!

559
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,348
- Chris! Chris!
- Chris! No!

560
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,823
Oh, my God, Chris, no!

561
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,897
Can you see anything?

562
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,467
- Can you see them?
- I don't know. I can't see.

563
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,900
Chris!

564
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,145
Michael, can you see?

565
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,731
Open the door!

566
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,076
Get him in, get him in!

567
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,684
Chris! Oh, my God, Chris!

568
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,017
Okay, look at me. Breathe, buddy.
Chris, mate, keep breathing.

569
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:57,814
Fuck!

570
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,750
- Chris! What happened?
- I don't fucking know!

571
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:03,358
- There were a lot of them!
- Where's Uri? Where's Uri?

572
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,861
Chris.

573
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,624
Chris, what happened to Uri?

574
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,760
They got him! They
fucking got him!

575
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:10,865
What the fuck got Uri?

576
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,063
Just breathe, baby!

577
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,908
- Hold him, hold him.
- Don't look!

578
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,148
- Where's your first aid Kit? He's cut.
- I don't know, check in here.

579
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,016
That's fucking fishing tackle!

580
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,722
Fuck!

581
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,658
Holy shit!

582
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,454
- What is that?
- Stay away from the windows!

583
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,930
Fuck off!

584
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,901
Hey, everyone away from
the fucking windows!

585
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,841
Stay away from the windows.

586
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,545
Chris. Chris, look at me, buddy.
Look at me, buddy.

587
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,472
It's gonna be all
right, brother.

588
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,453
Look at me, buddy. Stay
with me, all right?

589
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,150
- Get me the fuck outta here!
- I'm gonna get you home.

590
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:04,281
Chris, I'm gonna get you outta here.
Chris, look at me, look at me.

591
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,550
I'm gonna get you out. What
the fuck is with the lights?

592
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:09,498
Just relax. The battery's dying.
The fucking car battery is dying.

593
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,702
What the fuck is going on?

594
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,683
- Tie it tight.
- Can somebody please hold the light?

595
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:40,992
Good, good.

596
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,721
Fuck. Sorry, mate.

597
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,122
- Breathe, baby, just breathe.
- Breathe. Just breathe, mate.

598
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,202
Here, hold it up. Fuck. Here, mate.
Just breathe.

599
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,638
- I'm so sorry.
- Try not to look at it, mate.

600
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,707
Breathe, breathe.

601
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,068
I know, I know, I know!

602
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,337
It's gotta be tight,
I'm sorry, brother.

603
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,749
I'm so sorry, baby.

604
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,821
- What the fuck?
- Turn off the light, turn off the light!

605
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,220
Ah, fuck. Sorry, Chris.

606
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,760
Take it, take it.

607
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,126
Ah, fuck.

608
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,640
Here, Zoe. It'll be
all right, baby.

609
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,542
Just breathe, mate.
You're doing good.

610
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,336
- You're doing good.
- We're gonna get you out of this place.

611
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm freezing.

612
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,392
- I know.
- Fuck!

613
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,125
You're gonna be okay.

614
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,929
It's okay, baby.

615
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,126
- How are you feeling?
- He needs a doctor.

616
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,834
I know he needs a doctor.

617
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,729
How are you doing?

618
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,505
I just want to get the
fuck out of here.

619
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:06,213
I can't fix it. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, the, the leads have rotted.

620
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:10,947
I mean, if we could get some new
leads, we could roll-start it, but...

621
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,255
I ain't fuckin' seen this before.
Try it.

622
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,320
Uri, this is Paul.
Can you hear me?

623
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,629
- That the other walkie?
- Yeah.

624
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,865
Uri, are you there?
Can you hear me?

625
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,799
Come on.

626
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,066
- All right, I'm gonna go look for him.
- You don't know your way around.

627
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,567
But he does. He can help
us get out of here.

628
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,138
And what if the dogs come back?

629
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,240
Uri said the dogs
come out at night.

630
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,240
So just stay in the van
and keep the door shut.

631
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,311
I'll go with you.

632
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,752
No, you will not.

633
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,246
Uri is a big fellow and it might
take two of us to carry him back.

634
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:50,658
Yeah, what if he's dead?

635
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,918
Don't say that. Uri knows how
to get the fuck outta here.

636
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,119
We might find new leads...

637
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,296
You saw what attacked the car. He says
that there's other things out here.

638
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,865
- Come on. Just stay here.
- Please!

639
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,601
- Please!
- Stay.

640
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,870
Yeah, I'm gonna come too. I'm
gonna help these guys, okay?

641
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,672
All right, let's go.

642
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,546
You stay in the car, you keep the door shut.
We'll be back for you.

643
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,516
You'll be all right, mate.
We'll be back.

644
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,578
- Stay with them. Help them.
- Michael, this is stupid.

645
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,855
- Why would you do that?
- I'll be back.

646
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,655
How well you know Uri?

647
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,499
Not well. You?

648
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,098
Same, same.

649
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,534
You think he's still here?

650
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,938
It's been overnight.
He could be gone.

651
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,477
Yeah, I know.

652
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,808
What are you thinking?

653
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,413
I think Chris got
attacked by dogs.

654
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,886
Dogs didn't do that.

655
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,350
Maybe a bear? I mean, we saw a bear
run by us at the apartment yesterday.

656
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,153
- He said there was something else.
- Yeah, and it could be a bear.

657
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,855
He said there was a lot of dogs.
It was dark, he was in shock.

658
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,392
Try the walkie-talkie, will you?

659
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,900
Hey, Uri, are you there?
It's Paul.

660
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,807
- Lets go around here.
- Uri, can you hear me?

661
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,439
Just stay close and keep
your eyes open, all right?

662
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,844
I don't believe him when he said that
animals don't come out during the day.

663
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,714
I don't know what to believe.

664
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,746
Fuck.

665
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,449
This is where he went
off last night, right?

666
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,056
Let's just try and figure out
how we get back to the van.

667
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:36,696
Good idea, mate.

668
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,291
Check your walkie-talkie again.

669
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,435
Hey, Uri, this is Paul.
Can you hear me, buddy?

670
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,842
- What?
- Do it again, do it again, do it again.

671
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,842
Uri, do you come...

672
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,741
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

673
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,478
Holy shit.

674
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,112
Something fucking got him.

675
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,622
Okay, let's go. We need to go.

676
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,387
No, we can't, mate.

677
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,091
We have to see if he's alive.

678
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,137
Uri?

679
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,789
Uri?

680
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,678
Uri?

681
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,714
It's okay.

682
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,679
There's too much blood.

683
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,024
- There's no way that he's still alive.
- I know, I know.

684
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,419
We need to be smart about this.
We're not going back there.

685
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,526
We are. I'm gonna go.
Besides, he's got the gun.

686
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:54,928
He's right.

687
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,836
Let's do it.

688
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,628
Uri?

689
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,511
Uri?

690
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,958
Uri!

691
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,185
Oh, fuck!

692
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:54,592
Holy shit!

693
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:56,664
Look!

694
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,324
Gotta check his pockets.

695
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,669
- Shit! Where's the gun?
- Oh, shit.

696
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,502
Wait. I've got the clip.

697
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,799
Lock the fucking door!

698
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,305
Oh, what the fuck is that?

699
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,873
- Holy shit!
- Gun, gun, gun!

700
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,740
- Fuck, there's no bullets!
- Right here!

701
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,149
All right, I got it! I'll do it!

702
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,311
Go!

703
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,454
Oh, shit!

704
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:10,050
Forget it!

705
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:12,887
Motherfucker!

706
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,668
Get the fuck outta. We're
getting the fuck outta here.

707
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,736
- What do you mean? Where we going?
- What's going on?

708
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,438
- We gotta go.
- Where's Uri? Did you find him?

709
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,373
- Yeah, what's left of him.
- What?

710
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,442
What he said, man. Uri's dead.

711
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,444
- We better go, we can't stay here.
- He cannot walk.

712
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,712
We can't stay here.

713
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,747
- I don't have a choice. Help me.
- He's right.

714
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,819
- What? Babe, no!
- Come on, I'll help you.

715
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,318
- Ah, fuck.
- Real slow.

716
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,621
- Just do it real slow.
- Easy, easy, easy.

717
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:52,726
All right.

718
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:56,534
- Aw, fuck.
- There you go. There you go.

719
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:00,063
- Fuck!
- Goddamn it, I told you, he can't walk!

720
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:02,601
- Put it back up, put it back up.
- Easy, easy.

721
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:04,767
- What's going on?
- All right, we gotta carry him.

722
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,836
- Don't be fucking stupid.
- We're not gonna leave you here!

723
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,647
It'll take three of you to
carry me and twice as long!

724
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:11,574
Fine. I'm staying here with him.

725
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,909
- I'm not leaving him!
- Well, I'm not leaving him either!

726
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,514
Would you listen to me?

727
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,456
You live here. You're the only
one that speaks the language.

728
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,590
Go get help and bring it back.

729
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,994
We're staying in the van.

730
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,468
All right.

731
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,495
- Take this.
- We'll be back. Come on, Zoe.

732
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,830
Stay on channel one.

733
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,766
If you guys need anything, if
anything happens, you call us.

734
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,669
It's 13 miles. We're gonna leave now.
If we hurry...

735
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,616
- We'll be back before it's dark.
- What if you're not back?

736
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,113
Take it.

737
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,812
- You know how to use that?
- Yeah, I think so.

738
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,717
All right, let's go.

739
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,653
- Paul, wait.
- We'll be back, mate.

740
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,114
Come on, let's go, Zoe.

741
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:53,116
- Look, I'm sorry...
- Stop. Stop.

742
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,528
I'm gonna get you home.

743
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,323
We'll be back
before you know it.

744
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,596
It's okay, babe. It's okay.

745
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:07,296
Way to go, Paul. Fucked
things up this time.

746
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,732
Okay, don't think like that. Come
on, that's not helping anyone.

747
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,634
I've been doing this his
whole fucking life.

748
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,615
I always get him into shit.
He always pays for it.

749
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,739
Well, despite all that,
you're his big brother.

750
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,846
So right now he's counting on you
to get him out of this. Okay?

751
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,685
Wait, wait!

752
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:30,791
Holy shit.

753
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:35,726
- Come on.
- We got to find a way around.

754
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,538
- Michael?
- Stay quiet.

755
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,335
- We'll loop around.
- Oh, God. Okay, go. Go, go-go.

756
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,408
Zoe, Zoe! Come on.

757
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,852
Shit. Guys.

758
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,491
The radiation's getting worse.

759
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,595
Let's go.

760
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,609
What is that? Look.

761
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,545
Holly shit.

762
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,618
- Will any of them start?
- No, babe, the batteries would be dead.

763
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,549
We might be able to find some cables, though.
Check the cars. Let's go!

764
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:37,688
Oh, fuck.

765
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,331
Wait! Wait!

766
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:43,702
Jesus! What the fuck?

767
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,095
- Who would shoot at a bus?
- I don't know, babe.

768
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,200
The guards?

769
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,042
These are exit holes.

770
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,110
Whatever was shooting was
shooting from the inside out.

771
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,411
- Can we just find these cables, please?
- Yeah.

772
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,415
Paul?

773
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:06,716
Paul?

774
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:07,718
Paul?

775
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,204
Amanda, there's
shells everywhere.

776
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,752
Maybe there's a gun in here.

777
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,716
Well, let's look.

778
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,768
Okay, wait, no. No. Come on, let's
get back to Michael and Zoe.

779
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,271
What if something's back there?

780
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,711
Goddamn it.

781
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,258
Nothing.

782
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,197
Oh, shit!

783
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:27,898
You okay?

784
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:31,805
Yeah.

785
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,839
Come on.

786
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,720
- Any bullets?
- No.

787
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,916
- It's broken, it won't fire.
- Look.

788
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:44,851
It works.

789
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,925
That's a piece of
a guard uniform.

790
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:51,792
Oh, let's get out of here.

791
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,033
Let's go.

792
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,465
What?

793
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,868
- Is it the same one?
- Oh, yeah!

794
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,242
- Will it work? Do you think it'll work?
- I think so.

795
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,506
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Call your bro.

796
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:13,754
Hey, Natalie? This is Paul.
Are you guys there?

797
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,317
Yeah, we're here.
Where are you guys?

798
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:21,054
You're not gonna believe this.
We got cables for the van.

799
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,852
When are you coming back?

800
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,390
Uh, we're heading back now.
Uh, how's my brother doing?

801
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:28,503
He's fine. Please hurry back.

802
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,000
'Cause we want to get
the fuck out of here.

803
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:37,473
Come on, come on!

804
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,536
Hey, Chris? You hang in there, buddy.
We're coming back for you right now!

805
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:41,811
We're on our way.

806
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,845
Come on, Zoe!

807
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,686
I can't run!

808
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:57,494
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Oh, my God!

809
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,732
This way. Here, here, here!

810
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,703
All right, come on, come on!

811
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,308
Come on!

812
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,703
You're good, babe.

813
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,744
You gotta go! You gotta go.

814
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,610
Keep moving, come on! Come on!

815
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,677
- You've gotta go!
- All right, all right.

816
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,113
Come on, come on.

817
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,747
Zoe, you've gotta
keep moving, babe!

818
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,546
- Zoe, it's okay.
- Come on, Zoe.

819
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,685
Yes!

820
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,122
- Come on, Zoe!
- You can do it, Zoe! Come on!

821
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,512
- Keep moving!
- Zoe, come on!

822
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:32,890
Oh, shit!

823
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,435
'Zoe! 'Zoe!

824
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,600
- Good. Here.
- Get back.

825
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,116
Michael!

826
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:57,883
Get him out!

827
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,352
Get him up.

828
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,322
- Oh, my leg! My leg!
- Are you okay?

829
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,654
- It's just a scratch. It's okay.
- Get him up. Let's get him up.

830
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,690
Pull me up!

831
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,299
- Come on!
- We gotta move!

832
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,727
- Look at me! Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

833
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,529
Guys, come on. Let's get
the fuck out of here!

834
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:15,002
Damn it!

835
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,079
How's the leg?

836
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,681
Yeah, I'm all right, mate. I
just want to get us out of here.

837
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,016
Chris should be in
Moscow right now.

838
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,017
Exactly, but he's not.

839
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,999
So tell me what you know so we
can figure out what is going on.

840
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,523
Just urban legend, man.

841
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:42,265
They say this place
isn't really abandoned.

842
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:45,027
Well, obviously, the radiation
hasn't killed everything.

843
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,062
- I don't believe any of that shit.
- Why not can't you believe it?

844
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,197
There's so much that's
been going on...

845
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,118
There's people gotta be
out here doing this shit.

846
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,514
- Think about it!
- There has to be something. He's right.

847
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,503
- I mean, think about it.
- Chris.

848
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:57,610
Uri. That thing in the kitchen.
What was that?

849
00:57:57,741 --> 00:58:00,309
And I swear there was something
in a photo I took the other day.

850
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,111
I didn't think anything
of it at the time, but...

851
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:04,346
- See? The photo.
- It was a shadow...

852
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:07,191
It didn't make sense at the time,
nothing had happened then.

853
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,694
Listen. Listen, okay?

854
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,664
- Zoe, come on.
- Come on, let's go!

855
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,435
What? This is where we were.

856
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,871
- Did they get it started?
- And they wouldn't call us?

857
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,284
- Natalie?
- Wait, look! Over here.

858
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,545
What? Is that from the van?

859
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:37,613
Oh, my God.

860
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,184
What the fuck?

861
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:46,155
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

862
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:47,328
Chris!

863
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:48,727
Chris!

864
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,637
Fuck!

865
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,110
- Chris!
- Whoa! Keep it down, mate.

866
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:07,450
Hey, come here!

867
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:10,818
- Chris!
- Hey, guys! It's recording.

868
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,219
What, what?

869
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,851
I don't know. It's Chris.

870
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,697
- What are you talking about?
- Just listen.

871
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,694
- I love you, Natalie.
- I love you, too, baby.

872
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:27,697
- I love you so much.
- I know.

873
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:31,306
I just need you to know that.

874
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:34,103
I was gonna wait
'til Moscow, but...

875
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,771
No, babe, wait till Moscow.

876
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:36,805
We're gonna be there tomorrow...

877
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,581
And then you can do
everything as planned, okay?

878
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:39,677
I know, but I just...

879
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,619
What was that?

880
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,988
Babe, grab the camera.
Shine it over here.

881
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,194
- Is that them?
- I don't know.

882
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,588
- Can you see anything?
- I don't see anybody.

883
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,495
- Is it Paul?
- I don't know.

884
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,265
- What the fuck is happening? No...
- Keep it down.

885
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,900
- Chris!
- Keep your shit together!

886
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:39,244
Stay the fuck away from me!

887
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,712
Shit! Just keep it down.

888
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,682
- I'm not leaving my brother!
- He's not here.

889
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,717
- Chris!
- What was that?

890
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,778
- Chris? Chris? Chris!
- Please, be quiet.

891
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:50,780
Shit!

892
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,449
Chris!

893
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,818
We can't leave them. We can't leave them.
We need to find them.

894
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,026
We need to find them!
Please! Let's go!

895
01:00:58,254 --> 01:00:59,488
Please, Michael, we
need to find them.

896
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,332
- Fucking hell!
- Please!

897
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,077
There, through there.

898
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:24,383
Careful.

899
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:32,595
Oh, Chris!

900
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:43,335
Oh, Chris!

901
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:51,875
Natalie?

902
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,534
Is that Chris?

903
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,008
Chris?

904
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:31,587
Chris?

905
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,393
Come on, Zoe.

906
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:46,535
Baby, we have to, he's got the gun.
Come on.

907
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,411
Chris?

908
01:03:01,678 --> 01:03:02,679
Nat?

909
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:04,917
Chris?

910
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,522
- He's not here.
- I heard him. I heard him.

911
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:16,299
- Paul! We've got to go!
- We can't stay here. Let's go.

912
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:17,726
Come on, please? Please,
mate, we'll find him.

913
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,104
I'm sorry. Come on.

914
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,468
Ri-in!

915
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,717
Natalie!

916
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,458
Come on. Come on, nat, come on!

917
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,684
Oh, Jesus!

918
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,062
Come on! This way, this way!

919
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,426
I got her! I got her! Okay,
you're okay, baby. You're okay.

920
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:48,659
Michael?

921
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:51,335
I got you. It's okay, it's okay.

922
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:52,939
It's a fucking map. Look!

923
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:55,936
Natalie, where's Chris?

924
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,704
Natalie, where's Chris?

925
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:00,536
Paul!

926
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:01,870
What happened to my brother?

927
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,639
While we're going this
way, he's in there!

928
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,710
Hey, leave her alone!

929
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,209
Shit.

930
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,921
Natalie, where's Chris?

931
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,548
The people... they got him.

932
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,256
That's the road we came in on.

933
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,452
So then we came onto the checkpoint,
and that's another checkpoint.

934
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,888
And we're here. Hey, there's
another checkpoint!

935
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:23,325
It's close. We can get there. We'll
find help and come back. I promise.

936
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,127
- I can't leave yet.
- I understand, but we got to go.

937
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,695
I'm not leaving
without my brother!

938
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,031
We need to! We don't even
know if Chris is still...

939
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,700
Don't you fucking say that!
Don't you fucking say that!

940
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:36,701
Give me the gun! Back off! Back off!
I'm sorry, mate. We want to help you.

941
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,683
We'll find your brother, I promise,
but we gotta go. We need help.

942
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,311
- Please? Please?
- Paul, Paul?

943
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:43,946
No, Paul!

944
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:47,249
We're gonna find Chris but we are
no good to him if we're dead, okay?

945
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,958
Listen to me! Listen
to me, Paul, okay?

946
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,321
We're gonna go find help, and
then we're gonna come back...

947
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,056
And we're gonna get
your brother, okay?

948
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,857
Fuck. We need to get out of here.
Show me the map again.

949
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,929
Right now, I need you
to get it together.

950
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,503
For everyone else's
sake and mine.

951
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,800
All right?

952
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:04,911
Come on!

953
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:10,540
Come on!

954
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,782
That doesn't make sense.

955
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,688
The radiation's getting worse.

956
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,896
We've got to keep going. Come on.
We've got to keep going, come on!

957
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,257
Zoe, come on.

958
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,360
- Here, Michael, it doesn't make sense.
- What do you mean?

959
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:32,728
Because the map says that...

960
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:35,437
- Zoe, come on. We gotta go that way.
- ...we're supposed to be here. No, but look.

961
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,668
It says that this way
is supposed to be...

962
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:40,312
Michael, look at it, it stops!

963
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:44,039
- Then we have to go back.
- Which way do we have to go?

964
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,743
- If we go back here...
- I know it's not. Zoe, Zoe, please?

965
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,849
- Michael, no, we have to go!
- Guys, guys!

966
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,886
What the fuck?

967
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:59,395
Wait!

968
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,200
Hello?

969
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,708
What are you saying?

970
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,232
Natalie!

971
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:38,462
Oh, my God!

972
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,065
No!

973
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:46,006
- Where is she?
- She's gone!

974
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,010
Natalie!

975
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:54,946
Listen, listen, listen!

976
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,855
This way, this way!

977
01:06:57,914 --> 01:06:59,791
Zoe, stay in front of me.

978
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,995
Holy shit! That's a guard!

979
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,133
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go!

980
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,005
Natalie?

981
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,319
Natalie?

982
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,544
- Shit!
- We've got to go.

983
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,649
Nat!

984
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,626
- Where is she?
- I don't know, I don't know!

985
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,761
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

986
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,729
Move, move, move! Come on!

987
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,266
Michael! Michael!

988
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,905
- Fuck, there's too many!
- Come on!

989
01:07:58,441 --> 01:07:59,920
Keep going, keep going.

990
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:02,418
Here, there.

991
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,396
Hurry the fuck up!

992
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,198
Come on.

993
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,875
Come on!

994
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,452
Boxes! Shut the fucking door!

995
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,047
Push! Push!

996
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,478
- Come on, come on.
- Ah, they're coming!

997
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:49,036
- Kick it!
- There's another room back here!

998
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,031
Michael, come on!

999
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,062
Zoe, just get going! Go, go!

1000
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:54,905
Michael!

1001
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,132
- Go, get in, get in.
- Michael!

1002
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,579
Zoe, get inside!

1003
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,108
Zoe, get inside!

1004
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:05,044
- Come on! Close the door.
- Michael!

1005
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:09,377
- Push it! Push it!
- It's stuck!

1006
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:10,857
Michael, get in! Get in!

1007
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:14,053
Michael!

1008
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,490
He's trapped in there!
He can't get out!

1009
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,558
No, we have to go.

1010
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:57,799
Go!

1011
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:14,814
Go!

1012
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,233
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.

1013
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,267
It's okay. It's okay.

1014
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:42,249
- No, no, no, no, Zoe!
- Get up, Zoe, come on.

1015
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,310
I got you, I got you. Come on.

1016
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,688
What is this place?

1017
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:19,846
Shit.

1018
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,435
Not down. Not down.

1019
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:41,203
Fuck!

1020
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,444
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1021
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,375
Fuck!

1022
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:48,913
Oh, fuck. Put the light on!

1023
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:51,709
Zoe.

1024
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,953
Put the fucking lighten!

1025
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:56,012
Put the fucking light on!

1026
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,647
This must be where
they were living.

1027
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,678
Keep moving. Come
on, keep moving.

1028
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:29,655
Chris? Chris?

1029
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:35,885
Chris?

1030
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:43,995
Chris?

1031
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:51,074
Go, go, go!

1032
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,210
Which way?

1033
01:12:58,874 --> 01:12:59,875
Come on, I'll help you.

1034
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:03,287
- Paul, go!
- Give me your hand. Come on.

1035
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:08,288
- Oh, my God! They're coming!
- Give me your hand!

1036
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:09,684
Come on, come on!

1037
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,631
No! "Go!"

1038
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:19,270
Don't let go, Zoe!

1039
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,475
No!

1040
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:33,043
No! No!

1041
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,672
Up here, up here.

1042
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:01,446
Come on, come on, come on!

1043
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:04,811
Paul?

1044
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,319
I let them all go.

1045
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:10,986
It's my fault.

1046
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,659
Come on, come on. We
can still find them.

1047
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,699
We can still find them.

1048
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:25,293
Come on, let's just go. We can
still find them. Come on.

1049
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,672
Please? Just take my hand.
Come on.

1050
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,805
We gotta get outta here.

1051
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:45,822
There's something
wrong with my eyes.

1052
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,785
Oh, fuck.

1053
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,456
Hey, my face is burning.

1054
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:51,595
Fuck, you look all blurry.

1055
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:54,194
What is that?

1056
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,301
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1057
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:00,395
Come on! Come on! Please, hurry!

1058
01:15:00,396 --> 01:15:03,536
- Fuck! Everything's blurry.
- I know. Okay, I got you.

1059
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:06,670
We gotta find a way out of here
before the radiation kills us.

1060
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,714
- Are you okay?
- -Yeah, go. I'm fine.

1061
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,086
Careful. Okay.

1062
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,324
Oh, no.

1063
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,266
I'm so sorry, Amanda.

1064
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:37,869
No.

1065
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:50,720
Amanda, we can't stay here.

1066
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:53,490
We can't stay here.
We have to go.

1067
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:57,322
And I can't leave without you.
So please, let's just go.

1068
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,280
- Wait.
- A way out.

1069
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,888
Oh, fuck.

1070
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,386
Holy shit.

1071
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,134
No!

1072
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,448
Run! Run!

1073
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,336
I can't see anything.

1074
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,351
I can't see... Help!

1075
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,315
- Help!
- Help!

1076
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:33,885
Help!

1077
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,395
- We need help!
- Help!

1078
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:40,889
Please!

1079
01:17:41,924 --> 01:17:44,404
Stop! Don't come any closer!

1080
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,995
Help us, please!

1081
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:48,896
Stop!

1082
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,104
- Please, help us!
- Please, stop!

1083
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,213
- No!
- Please!

1084
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:34,575
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?
What is your name?

1085
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:36,283
Where are you taking me?

1086
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:37,578
Ow, my face!

1087
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:39,889
It's okay. How did you
get into Pripyat?

1088
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,817
There were people.
They were chasing us.

1089
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:46,687
Yes, patients, victim of radiation.
They escaped.

1090
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,222
You saw them, yes?

1091
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,998
They killed my friends.

1092
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:53,236
- Anyone else know you're here?
- No.

1093
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,936
Where are you taking me?

1094
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,410
What is this place?

1095
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:07,844
We're in the hospital. We're
taking you to doctor.

1096
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,990
What is the status of the
patients that escaped?

1097
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:13,192
We got them all.

1098
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:15,416
And the Americans?

1099
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,718
All dead, except for this one.

1100
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,700
- Where did you find her?
- Outside the reactor.

1101
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,835
We can't let her go.

1102
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:24,794
She's seen them.

1103
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,261
My skin is burning.

1104
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,139
You were inside reactor.

1105
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:31,711
It's extremely dangerous.

1106
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:36,072
Okay...

1107
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:37,708
We will help.

1108
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:52,699
- No, no, no!
- Go! Go!

1109
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,200
Who's there?
