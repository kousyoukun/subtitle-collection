1
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,602
Bye, L.A.!

2
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:22,939
Here we go.

3
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,451
My friends are morons.

4
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,458
You better be careful or you might end up
in the Tower of London.

5
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,960
Criminal.

6
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,173
Ta-da!

7
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,893
But it's gonna be you.

8
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,566
- Forget the plane.
- This is backwards, by the way.

9
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:13,197
And here in front of us,
we have the beautiful...

10
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,783
- ...Danube River.
- Uh!

11
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,165
We're doing Prague.

12
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,584
Hi, Paul! We're at the Tower of London!

13
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,462
Here we come, Kiev.
We're coming to see you, Paul.

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,674
You guys are ridiculous.

15
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,342
- Dude, it was so much fun, man.
- Yeah, I can imagine.

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,053
- Hey, ladies! You wanna put your stuff away?
- Some place you got here, Paul.

17
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,848
I'm never leaving. Best place ever.
Ain't it right, Chris?

18
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,558
- I got it, it's fine.
- I got it, I insist.

19
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,561
- Where are we sleeping?
- I told you, I put a pillow on the patio for you.

20
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,979
"I told you,
I put a pillow on the patio for you."

21
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,731
You're sleeping in my room!
Where do you think?

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,193
- Great. Some chick still sleeping in there?
- Quite possibly.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,403
I hope you cleaned those sheets.
Or burned them.

24
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,071
I heard that!

25
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,824
So, Kiev, huh?

26
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,701
Kiev, baby!

27
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,537
I thought for sure your ADD
would have kicked in by now.

28
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,373
Dude, I'm telling you, man.
I don't think I'm leaving.

29
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,460
I love it here!
The chicks, they're fucking amazing.

30
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,715
They absolutely love Americans
and they are completely fucking insane.

31
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,592
Yeah, well, they have to be
if they want anything to do with you.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,552
- So, Amanda.
- Yeah, okay.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,096
- What? Chris! Come on.
- I knew this was coming.

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,433
Rob literally broke up with her three weeks
before we were supposed to come here...

35
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,602
...and Natalie had to drag her ass
onto the airplane.

36
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,771
Perfect! Look at her.

37
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,273
She's lonely, she's in Europe.

38
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,694
- You're a sick son-of-a-bitch.
- I'm not sick, dude!

39
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,029
Would you stop?

40
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,323
- Heh. Do I have a shot with her?
- No, you don't. Zero.

41
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,699
No? All right. Fine.

42
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,995
- I'll leave it alone.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,832
What about you and Natalie?
You guys going good?

44
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,335
- It's creepy when you look at me like that, dude.
- Hold this.

45
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,175
Are you serious? Are you serious?

46
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,261
Yeah, dude!

47
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,389
I haven't asked her yet.
I'm gonna propose in Moscow.

48
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,349
- Does she have any idea?
- I hope not.

49
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,684
- What about Amanda?
- No.

50
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,019
That's awesome, dude.

51
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,865
Unbelievable. A fucking riot.

52
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,034
Oh, man, thank you so much.
This was such a good night.

53
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,244
Yeah, it was.

54
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,247
Told you, man. Okay!
Save it for the apartment. Get a room!

55
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,749
Go to town, we're in Europe!
Don't listen to him.

56
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,710
- Whoa! You all right?
- Hello! Thank you, good save.

57
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,213
Watch out!
These cobblestones, they'll get you.

58
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,383
Thank you for being a good host.
We've had a lot of fun.

59
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:42,013
My pleasure.
You enjoying yourself in Kiev?

60
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,600
I am. Yeah, it's a beautiful little city.
Yeah, it's great.

61
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,393
Wait till Moscow.

62
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,897
Wait until you get to Moscow.
You believe me?

63
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,607
Mm. I don't know.

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,110
Do you trust me?
I don't trust you in those heels.

65
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,613
- Paul. Hands off!
- Sorry.

66
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,075
- You're trouble.
- I am trouble!

67
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,079
I can't promise what's gonna happen
at the end of the road, but-- Don't fall.

68
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,290
Those stairs are slippery.

69
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,418
Please, lock your door tonight.
I don't trust him.

70
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,920
- Christopher.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,632
- You are visiting your brother in Kiev.
- Yeah, well, I had to chase you down.

72
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,885
I didn't know when you booked this trip,
it was a one-way ticket.

73
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,638
I miss you, buddy.

74
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,390
Yeah, I miss you too, man.
It's good to see you.

75
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,268
- How are things back home? Good?
- Yeah, things are great.

76
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,438
Mom's worried sick, of course.
You know how she is.

77
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,775
You spoken to Dad?

78
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,444
No, I, uh.... No.

79
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,113
- You should call him.
- I know I should.

80
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,032
- Paul, which way should we go?
- Left.

81
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,790
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want
any trouble, seriously.

82
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,091
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.

83
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,926
- Good night.
- Have a good night.

84
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,636
Good night. Bye-bye.

85
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,971
Come on, come on, come on.

86
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,681
Fucking losers.

87
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,474
- Nice.
- Real friendly people here.

88
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,435
Don't worry about it.
We got a big day tomorrow.

89
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,692
Okay, I'm assuming that this is
the breakfast menu? But I don't know.

90
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,568
Excuse me, is this the--?

91
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,572
- Yeah, she hasn't had her coffee yet.
- Wow.

92
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,658
Where's Paul?
He's supposed to help us with this.

93
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,368
I don't know, I just want something greasy.

94
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,828
Can you just point out
something greasy, please?

95
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,997
You need the Hangover Special.

96
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,835
Amanda, I want to apologize
for Paul's behavior last night.

97
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,714
Oh, please. He's fine.
I mean, I know the type, you know?

98
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,923
Just all talk.

99
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,342
Yeah, well, with him,
it's not always just talk.

100
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,678
I can handle him,
I'm not too worried about it.

101
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,681
And I'm sure,
deep down in there...

102
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,100
- Very, very deep down.
- ...somewhere...

103
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,686
...he's a good guy, you know?
It's just an act, that's all.

104
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,980
I mean, he's related to you, baby,
and you turned out all right.

105
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,523
- That's true.
- Yeah, you're okay.

106
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,359
That's true. Just let me know
if I need to kick his ass for you.

107
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,487
- Thanks, dude, I appreciate-- Hello!
- Morning, children. How are you doing?

108
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,574
Fantastic. So I know I said
we're going to Moscow.

109
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:07,825
Mm-hm.

110
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,327
But I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want an answer.

111
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,746
The answer is already no.

112
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,040
You guys ever heard of Chernobyl?

113
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,708
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

114
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,502
Isn't that where
the nuclear disaster happened?

115
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,714
Yes. I met this really cool guy,
Uri, who's a, uh....

116
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,550
Have you heard of extreme tourism?

117
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,886
- Uh, somehow, I haven't, no.
- You guys see where this is going, right?

118
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,221
We're going to Moscow,
as we talked about.

119
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,556
Chris? Can I please finish?

120
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,728
So, there's this place called Pripyat. It's a
town right next to Chernobyl. Uri, who is...

121
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,189
...very excited to take us there...

122
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,067
...is an extreme tour guide.
He's gonna show us this city...

123
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,735
...that was abandoned overnight.

124
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,112
Literally. They had no time to take anything.

125
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,575
Factories, schools, stores, homes,
apartments, everything's still there.

126
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,744
Imagine the photo shoot
you can have there, Amanda?

127
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,371
Yeah. But-- Okay, I hear that, but it's--

128
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,083
Radiation levels or something,
it's probably pretty dangerous, right?

129
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,377
No. We'll only be there for a day. A few hours,
see some cool shit and then we split.

130
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,005
- How are we gonna get there?
- Uri's gonna take us.

131
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,381
- He's got a van.
- A van?

132
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,925
- Yeah.
- He has a van?

133
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,593
He has a van!

134
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,847
Okay. Aside from the sketchy van situation...

135
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,892
...and if you promise that this tour is safe...

136
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,936
...I think it could be kind of cool.

137
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,562
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You're kidding.

138
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,731
No. I mean-- I don't know. He's right.

139
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,985
We're in Europe, we might as well see as
much as we possibly can while we're here.

140
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,445
I don't know.

141
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,156
- Tell me you don't want to meet Uri.
- I don't want to meet Uri.

142
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,075
How can you say that?
You haven't even met him yet.

143
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,244
We'll take some pictures,
explore a bit, and then we'll be on our way.

144
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,496
Just as planned. Right?

145
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,164
I don't like that he's rubbing off on you.

146
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,543
- He's definitely not rubbing off.
- You're incredible, you know that?

147
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,754
All right, let's just settle this
by a show of hands, please?

148
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,840
Who's coming with Paul to Chernobyl?

149
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,304
Yeah!

150
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,765
You're kidding me, right?
You guys are so weak.

151
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,645
All right, kids! Welcome to
Uri's Extreme Travel. Let's do it.

152
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,273
- Uri's Extreme Travel.
- Uri!

153
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,067
What's up, buddy?

154
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,319
- How are you?
- Good morning.

155
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,656
- Come in! Welcome, welcome.
- All right, man! The gang is all here.

156
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,700
- This is my little brother Chris.
- How you doing?

157
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,452
His girlfriend Natalie. The lovely Amanda.

158
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,371
- Guys, this is Uri.
- Hi.

159
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,873
Hello.

160
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,294
I was telling them about our little adventure
today and Chris got parental, as usual.

161
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,338
So I figured you'd give him a little
peace of mind before he pisses his pants.

162
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,048
You're feeling nervous?

163
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,717
No, I'm not. I'm not nervous.

164
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,012
It's a nice shop you got here,
it's very professional.

165
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,472
Thank you. It's all mine.

166
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,017
- It's all yours, huh?
- Yeah, very nice.

167
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,561
- Yes, it's all mine.
- Well, what are you, ex-military?

168
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,229
Yes, Special Forces.

169
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,565
What does it matter
if he's a fucking magician, dude?

170
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,694
- I'm just asking a fucking question.
- Okay. Uri, what's the plan for today?

171
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,363
Well, this is a very well organized tour.

172
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,659
I've been taking special adventurous
tourists for a while now...

173
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,871
...so you should feel very, how do you say?

174
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,874
- Special?
- Special, I like that.

175
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:07,421
Okay, so imagine, you have big city
and no one's there. All to yourself.

176
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,714
Is it safe?

177
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,885
Of course it's safe.
This is not my first rodeo, Natalika.

178
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,388
- So sorry we're late!
- Well, now we're here.

179
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,557
Hey. You guys with the special tour, yeah?

180
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,769
- Yeah!
- I'm Michael, this is my Viking Zoe.

181
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,812
How you doing? I'm Chris.
Nice to meet you.

182
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,898
What's up, man? I'm Paul.
Nice to meet you, buddy.

183
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,566
- Okay, we go!
- We go now.

184
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,235
- Come, come.
- All right.

185
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,445
- Sweet.
- We didn't keep you waiting?

186
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,740
- No. You guys are fine.
- That's all I told you, go with the plan.

187
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,534
So, tell me, what's up with
the whole "Viking" thing?

188
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,871
He calls me that all the time.
I'm from Norway, so....

189
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,415
And he's my Australian surfer dude.

190
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,917
All right, let's rock 'n' roll!

191
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,419
Yes.

192
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,256
Yeah, buddy!

193
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,757
- Are you kidding?
- Wow.

194
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,260
That's what we're riding in?

195
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,763
- Might as well just... roll with it.
- Put your bags in the back.

196
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,141
Whoo!

197
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,770
- First time, mate?
- Pripyat? Yeah. How about you guys?

198
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,731
Yeah. Someone said it's pretty fantastic.

199
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,441
Yeah, I heard it's pretty awesome.

200
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,277
- You two sweethearts mooning?
- "Mooning"?

201
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,112
- We what?
- Honeymooning.

202
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,989
Yeah, actually, we are honeymooning.

203
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,740
We're just friends. Barely.

204
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,492
- Ouch.
- You're cute.

205
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,786
- Are you guys?
- Oh, yeah, we're timeless.

206
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,788
No. A month.

207
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,832
You guys have only been together a month?
God bless.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,126
- Wow.
- These two are practically married.

209
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,298
- We go.
- Shotgun!

210
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,507
Thank you.

211
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,680
Anybody gets hungry, I have beefjerky.

212
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,980
Pripyat is two hours from here,
and Chernobyl is not far from there.

213
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,150
- Good time!
- What exactly happened in Chernobyl?

214
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,821
The Chernobyl disaster was a result
of failed systems tests.

215
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,781
It caused sudden power surge.

216
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,410
And reactor number four
became one with the air.

217
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,661
One with the air?

218
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,830
- Vaporized.
- It exploded.

219
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,170
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

220
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,008
Nature has reclaimed its rightful home.

221
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,819
Here we are.

222
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,364
Welcome to Pripyat.

223
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,034
Photo.

224
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,205
We're now entering exclusion zone.

225
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,419
How long is it safe to be here?

226
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,215
It's very safe.
We'll only be in Pripyat for two hours.

227
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,092
What is this place? Is it like a checkpoint?

228
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,510
Looks like it.

229
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,554
Why would there be a checkpoint
at an abandoned town?

230
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,890
Tourists.

231
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,477
Okay.

232
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,063
- Let me do the talking.
- Oh, you think?

233
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,564
Put your cameras away.

234
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,066
Yeah, got it.

235
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,822
- Tough guys.
- Yeah. These guys look pretty serious.

236
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,073
Yeah.

237
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,912
I don't know what they're saying,
but this guy is saying no.

238
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,789
Look at this guy.

239
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,083
What do you think is going on?

240
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:37,089
- Ohh. Scary!
- God, look at that guy. He's huge.

241
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,520
Make sure he doesn't see me.

242
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,605
- How's that?
- Criminal soul.

243
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,232
Do I look like one of them?

244
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,537
Uh, he is not letting us in today.
There's maintenance going on.

245
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,292
Maintenance work? I thought you said
this place was abandoned.

246
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,794
It is unusual.

247
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,965
Usually, they let me know in advance
if something like this is going to happen.

248
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,469
Wait, I thought you said everything
was gonna be taken care of.

249
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,346
We paid for this tour, bro.

250
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,265
I know, I know.

251
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,809
Don't worry.

252
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,312
There's more than one way into Pripyat.

253
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,980
Make it happen.

254
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,160
It's so bizarre,
I don't see any birds or anything.

255
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,164
This must be Uri's special entrance.

256
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,879
Paul, this looks fucking sketchy, man.

257
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,675
Stop being a pussy. We came all this way,
enjoy yourself, all right?

258
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,511
It's called being sensible.

259
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,481
This is not right, you guys.

260
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,733
We're gonna end up
in a Ukrainian jail or something.

261
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,529
Ahh! Come on, just think of it as an adventure.

262
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,531
It's okay.

263
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,617
- This is the awesomest.
- Really?

264
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:39,711
Okay, no problem.
Today we have Pripyat to ourselves.

265
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,464
Sweet.

266
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,550
All right.

267
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,056
Here we go.

268
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,244
I was not expecting a lake out here.

269
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,664
And there is Pripyat.

270
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,709
Home to the workers and families
of Chernobyl.

271
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,128
Wow.

272
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,966
It's incredible.

273
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,976
Hold on! This is going to be a little bumpy.

274
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,561
A little bumpy.

275
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,188
Oh, you're not gonna--

276
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,483
And down we go!

277
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,112
And up!

278
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,739
Oh, my God!

279
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,499
When are you putting seatbelts
in this thing?

280
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,628
- Jesus.
- Or barf-bags.

281
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,755
Ridiculous.

282
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:12,220
Okay. Now, I want to show you
something in water.

283
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,475
He wants to show us something in water.

284
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,978
Thank you.

285
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,314
After you.

286
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,445
- Stay close behind me.
- Like we're gonna go anywhere.

287
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,530
- Paul?
- Yeah?

288
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,660
I want you to tell me if you see
something moving in water. Okay?

289
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,787
Okay....

290
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,291
You don't want to get your booties wet.

291
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,350
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

292
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,519
You okay? You okay, mate?

293
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,523
Funny, bugger.

294
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,900
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- He's a fucking comedian.

295
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,069
- It's jerky.
- Jerky, you jerk.

296
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,362
Can we go?

297
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,197
- Fucking got me!
- Yeah. He got me, too.

298
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,992
Oh, shit!

299
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,828
It was a joke.

300
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,080
Sorry about that.

301
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,416
Come have look at this.

302
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,376
Is this another joke?

303
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,587
No. No, come.

304
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,258
Holy cow.

305
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,510
- Don't get too close.
- Why? It's dead.

306
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,221
- It's disgusting.
- Look at the chompers on him.

307
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,435
What is that thing?

308
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,272
- Touch it, mate.
- Whoa!

309
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,901
Who's the pussy now, huh?

310
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,362
- Can we go? This is disgusting.
- Keep it up.

311
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,072
Can we go? That's disgusting.

312
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,199
- That's awesome.
- And moving on.

313
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,910
See its teeth? It's cool, huh?

314
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,413
Oh, my God.

315
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,140
Did you just make a rhyme, Uri?

316
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,391
- Yes.
- Ha-ha-ha.

317
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,601
Make small joke.

318
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,270
- Not to worry.
- Here is Uri.

319
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,481
So, Uri, how long has this place
been abandoned?

320
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,902
It's been 25 years. Only recently
have radiation levels gone down.

321
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,447
Man, this is crazy. It's creepy as fuck.

322
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:42,078
We are back on main road.
It's only way in and out of Pripyat.

323
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,956
Yeah, except for your shortcut, right?

324
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:51,296
This is where the families of the workers
in Chernobyl lived.

325
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,298
Wow.

326
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,426
- See?
- Yeah.

327
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,471
- These were all full at one point.
- Yes. Very sad.

328
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,433
50,000 people, families, just left.

329
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,858
- Okay, hold on. Little bump, little bump.
- Oh, wow.

330
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,489
- The Ferris.
- Bumper cars?

331
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,700
- All right. We're here.
- I used to love those things.

332
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,829
Wow!

333
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,164
Still want to go home, Chris?

334
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,834
I'm happy we're here. Thanks.

335
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,461
- There we go. Brotherly love.
- You're welcome.

336
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,013
Whoa.

337
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,683
Guys, look at this.

338
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,357
Man.

339
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,528
Okay, everyone.
Stay near me and you'll be safe.

340
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,866
I have Geiger counter. It will let us know
if the radiation levels are high.

341
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,951
That's good.

342
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,206
Levels are good.

343
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,710
Can you guys imagine this, like,
full with kids? Like... playing?

344
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,378
It's really sad, actually.

345
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,380
They had no idea.

346
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,299
Wow.

347
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,553
I mean, this is just unbelievable.

348
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,017
I have never seen anything like this.

349
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,062
It's like they were getting ready
for a carnival or something.

350
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,233
They were preparing for "May Day,"
the celebration of Spring.

351
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,776
Never happened.

352
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,450
Okay, let's go. This way.

353
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,244
Can we get a photo?
Uri, you want to take it? A photo.

354
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,581
- Hey, guys?
- All right. Quick photo.

355
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,042
And new friends.

356
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,628
Okay.

357
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,213
Good.

358
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,990
It's so American.

359
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,311
In a way it's like....

360
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,024
There was life, and it just....

361
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,336
Hey, you hear that?

362
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,216
Silence.

363
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,763
It's like nature really has taken over.

364
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,725
One last thing.

365
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,949
Are we going in?

366
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,576
Yes.

367
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,540
What is it, babe?
Whoa, Zoe. Hey, babe, it's okay.

368
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:41,544
They usually don't come so close to town.
Must have been starving.

369
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,964
I reckon he's right.

370
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,676
Come in.

371
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:54,265
- That's disgusting.
- That's the VIP entrance. Treatment.

372
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,062
- Poor guy.
- Are there any other animals here?

373
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,065
Unlikely. Especially during the day.

374
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,442
Just you. Heh.

375
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,136
Stop it.

376
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,142
Here's one of a thousand apartments
that were abandoned.

377
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,270
Cool.

378
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:47,986
The people were not even given five minutes
to collect their personal possessions.

379
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,824
You can't take that. It's contaminated.

380
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,368
I was just look-- Spot the convict.
Cheers, man.

381
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,245
It's contaminated.

382
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:03,543
For a while, people came here
and they looted through these buildings.

383
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,671
They took these things,
sold them on black market.

384
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,965
People who bought them got sick...

385
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,509
...not knowing they were contaminated
by radiation.

386
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,011
Sorry, I was just--

387
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,513
Come, let's have a look.

388
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,350
But it's okay to be here and breathe?

389
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,685
Yes, yes.

390
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,522
We're not here long enough
to get exposure.

391
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,529
Chernobyl Reactor Number Four.
Where the disaster happened.

392
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,489
- That's pretty close.
- Have you been inside?

393
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,410
No. You can only go inside
with radiation suit.

394
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,746
Only for short period of time.

395
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,664
Here, take picture.

396
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,295
- Take a nice, romantic photo?
- All right, all right.

397
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,172
Hey, I wasn't gonna....

398
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,674
- Yeah, he was.
- This is going on the fridge.

399
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,887
- That's a metaphor here, by the way, guys.
- Do tell.

400
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,349
- That's beautiful.
- Our love is just exploding.

401
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,725
Oh, God.

402
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,521
The one good thing about the radiation
is that I'll probably finally grow a penis.

403
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,775
These guys are funny.

404
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,568
I know, I know.

405
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,321
- Can you beat that kiss?
- What?

406
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,971
We should go now.

407
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,266
It's going to get dark soon,
we should get back to van before then.

408
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,645
What the fuck was that?

409
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,982
- Right, it's gonna be a trick.
- Shh!

410
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,087
Stay.

411
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,611
- What the fuck is it?
- Shh, shh.

412
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,884
Holy shit! Go!

413
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,302
- Jesus!
- Motherfucker!

414
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,470
Oh, my God!

415
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,847
Holy shit!

416
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,724
- Is everyone okay?
- Don't fucking stand there!

417
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,517
Let's go, move, move, move!

418
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,852
Go!

419
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,189
- Fuck! What the fuck was that?
- Go, go.

420
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,692
A bear? A fucking brown bear? Oh, Jesus!

421
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,322
- What is a bear doing here?
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

422
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,491
- Jeez.
- Watch out for that.

423
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,868
Oh, fuck!

424
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,915
- Okay.
- Holy shit.

425
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,209
- Can we just get the fuck out of here?
- Yeah.

426
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,213
- Thanks for that.
- Yeah. Don't mention it.

427
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,923
Told you it'd be exciting, didn't I?

428
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:41,094
Yeah, almost getting mauled to death by
a radioactive bear from hell? Pretty exciting.

429
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,513
Anybody else have a story like this?

430
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,056
- Funny.
- You okay?

431
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,599
Anyone get a photo?

432
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,770
- A photo. This guy.
- Jesus.

433
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,400
Bear! Bear, bear! I'm kidding.

434
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,904
That's bad.

435
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,370
So, Uri, all the animals,
they stay in the woods, huh?

436
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,248
It's very unusual.
I've been doing this for five years.

437
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,251
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Kind of chilly out here, huh?

438
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,379
A dog, a wolf. But a bear, very odd.

439
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,256
It was exciting, right?

440
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,592
- Yeah, mate.
- No extra charge for bear attack.

441
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,302
Say goodbye to Pripyat.

442
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,304
- Ciao.
- Yeah, ciao-ciao.

443
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,140
Hey, Christopher?

444
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,517
Moscow! Thank you.

445
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,271
- I'll have to get your e-mail, eh?
- Yeah, for sure, dude.

446
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,232
- Catch up again? I'll be back to Kiev.
- Done, dude.

447
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,775
It was a blast.

448
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:39,610
Turn the heater on, buddy.

449
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,613
Pump it.

450
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,991
Give it some gas. Give it some gas.

451
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,742
What's up, is there gas in there?

452
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,744
Yes. Half a tank.

453
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,622
Is it the starter, mate?

454
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,458
Has this happened before?

455
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,419
I don't suppose you guys
have AAA out here?

456
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,259
Do you have reception?

457
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:06,512
I haven't had reception all day, guys.
There's no kind of reception out here.

458
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,474
- Look, look.
- What the fuck does that--?

459
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,978
What the fuck could've done that, mate?
That's fucking been chewed on.

460
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,106
Wait, what's happening?

461
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,441
What's going on?

462
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,860
- The wires have been destroyed.
- Chewed on.

463
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,945
What do you mean chewed on?
What kind of--? What, by what? An animal?

464
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,490
What kind of animal chews on car parts?

465
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,991
Are you sure we're out here alone?

466
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,827
Yes. You heard the soldiers this morning,
this place is off-limits.

467
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,621
We are here alone.

468
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,333
What the fuck is it, Michael?

469
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,502
That's the sparkplug leads,
been chewed on...

470
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,505
- Can you call someone?
- ...by a raccoon, a rat, or some animal.

471
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,298
But how would an animal get in here?

472
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,051
Under the car. Through the engine.

473
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,802
- Underneath?
- Yeah, yeah.

474
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,686
He said there aren't any around here
and all of a sudden--

475
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,896
I don't know.

476
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,191
Guys! Let's just shut up and let him--
We're trying to--

477
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,495
Fuck me.

478
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,084
Uh....

479
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,711
Uri?

480
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,132
What's the plan, mate?

481
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,177
Hey, big fella? What's the plan?

482
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,254
I'm so hungry I could die.

483
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,516
Well, this is great.

484
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,937
Gotta hand it to you.
Some fucking tour, mister.

485
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,606
This is not my fault.

486
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,691
Oh, really? Not your fault?

487
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,943
Because last time I checked,
you were the one that drove us out here.

488
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,737
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be here either.

489
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,448
I'm sorry to try and show you guys
some fun while you're out here visiting me.

490
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,450
Oh, yeah. Lot of fun.

491
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,035
Hey, Chris.

492
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,580
All right, you know what? Relax.

493
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,708
- We're fine.
- We're fucking stranded out here.

494
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,543
And don't tell me to relax.

495
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,963
I swear to God, this is the last time
I listen to one of your dumb fucking ideas.

496
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,049
You know what, Chris?
Your fucking whining isn't helping right now.

497
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,426
- He's got every right to be pissed.
- Okay, guys. Hey, Uri.

498
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,178
Someone has to know
we're out here, right?

499
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,805
I work alone.

500
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,476
Fucking great.

501
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,439
So, tell me, Uri.

502
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,900
What are our options right now?

503
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,568
We stay in van.

504
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,737
- Are we safe here?
- Yes, we're safe.

505
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,781
We close windows, lock doors.

506
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:16,577
In morning, I fix van, we drive up.
Or we all walk back to checkpoint.

507
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,120
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

508
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,206
Are you suggesting that we spend
the night here?

509
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,668
Okay, guys. I'm sorry, but we're gonna
have to hike out of here, all right?

510
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,378
Uri, how far to the checkpoint?

511
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,088
It's 20 kilometers.

512
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,839
That's like 12, 13 miles.

513
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,758
Exactly. We can hike that.

514
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,219
No, no, not at night!

515
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,388
- It is not safe.
- Shh, shh, shh! Be quiet!

516
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,732
What the fuck was that?

517
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,904
- Are there people here?
- It's impossible.

518
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,698
Shh.

519
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,950
It sounds like a baby.

520
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,290
What is that?

521
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,545
- It's not a baby.
- Then what the fuck is it, Uri?

522
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,424
Whoa. What's with the gun, man?

523
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,845
- You have problem?
- Yeah. What's with the fucking gun?

524
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,347
You should all be glad I have this.

525
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,641
Everyone stay here.

526
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,984
- A gun?
- Where is he going?

527
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,318
Do you trust him?

528
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,904
- Do you want to go out there with him?
- Easy, brother.

529
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,782
I don't know, it's just that the....

530
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,451
Stay here. He'll come back.

531
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,619
- Chris, what the fuck--?
- Where's he going?

532
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,664
- Chris, I'm coming with you.
- No, I don't want you to come with me.

533
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,126
Just sit in the car and think of another way
you can fuck this up even further.

534
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:50,337
I swear to God, Paul, it's a fucking hazard
having you as a brother.

535
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,174
Chris!

536
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,801
Chris!

537
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,262
- What's he gonna do?
- I don't know, babe.

538
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,639
- Where is he going?
- Uri, wait up!

539
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,860
I can't see him. Can you guys see him?

540
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,324
Oh, God.

541
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,000
Chris!

542
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,544
- Chris! Chris!
- Chris, no!

543
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,172
Oh, my God! Chris, no!

544
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,222
Can you guys see anything?

545
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,894
- Can you see them?
- I don't know. I can't see.

546
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,563
Chris!

547
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,527
Michael, can you see?

548
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:27,518
Open the door! Get him in, get him in!
Get him in, get him in!

549
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,943
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Chris!

550
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:40,614
Okay, look at me. Breathe, buddy.
Chris, mate, keep breathing.

551
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,783
- Fuck!
- Chris, what happened?!

552
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,619
I don't fucking know!
There were a lot of them!

553
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,913
Where's Uri? Where's Uri?

554
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,584
Chris. Chris, what happened to Uri?

555
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,752
They got him! They fucking got him!

556
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,629
What fucking got Uri?

557
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,256
Just breathe, baby!

558
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,175
- Hold him, hold him.
- Don't look!

559
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,385
Fucking first aid!

560
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,722
- Where's the first aid kit? He's cut.
- I don't know, check in here.

561
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,475
That's fucking fishing tackle!

562
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,979
Fuck!

563
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,106
Holy shit!

564
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,610
What the fuck--?
Stay away from the windows!

565
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,452
Fuck off!

566
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,413
Hey, everyone away
from the fucking windows!

567
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,040
Stay away from the windows.

568
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,088
Chris. Chris, look at me, buddy.
Look at me, buddy.

569
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,298
It's gonna be all right, brother.

570
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,592
Look at me, okay? Stay with me, all right?

571
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,678
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- I'm gonna get you home.

572
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,182
Chris, I'm gonna get you out of here.
Chris, look at me, look at me.

573
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,476
I'm gonna get you out.
What the fuck is with the lights?

574
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:54,104
Just relax. The battery's dying.
The fucking car battery is dying.

575
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,316
What the fuck is going on?

576
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:24,385
- Tie it tight.
- Can somebody please hold the light?

577
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,886
Good, good.

578
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,514
Fuck. Sorry, mate.

579
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,891
- Breathe, baby, just breathe.
- Breathe. Just breathe, mate.

580
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,395
Here, hold it up. Fuck. Here, mate.
Just breathe.

581
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,063
I'm so sorry.

582
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,856
Try not to look at it, mate.

583
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,358
Breathe, breathe.

584
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,902
I know, I know, I know!

585
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,238
It's gotta be tight, I'm sorry, brother.

586
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,031
I'm so sorry, baby.

587
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,370
- What the fuck?!
- Turn off the light, turn off the light!

588
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,707
Ah, fuck. Sorry, Chris.

589
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,389
Here, Zoe. It'll be all right, baby.

590
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,852
Just breathe, mate. You're doing good.

591
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,772
- I'm gonna get you out of this place.
- I'm freezing.

592
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,609
Shh. Shh. Shh.

593
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,910
- I know.
- Fuck!

594
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,288
You're gonna be okay. Okay.

595
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,416
It's okay, baby.

596
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,377
- How are you feeling?
- He needs a doctor.

597
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,254
I know he needs a doctor.

598
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,547
How are you doing?

599
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,716
I just want to get the fuck out of here.

600
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,093
I can't fix it. I'm sorry.

601
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,804
I'm sorry, the leads have rotted.

602
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:55,434
I mean, if we could get some new leads,
we could roll-start it, but....

603
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,777
I ain't fucking seen this before. Try it.

604
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,112
Uri, this is Paul. Can you hear me?

605
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,364
- That the other walkie?
- Yeah.

606
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,286
Uri, are you there? Can you hear me?

607
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,662
Come on.

608
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,084
- All right, I'm gonna go look for him.
- You don't know your way around.

609
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,668
But he does. He can help us
get out of here.

610
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,629
And what if the dogs come back?

611
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,130
Uri said the dogs come out at night.

612
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,509
- Stay in the van and keep the door shut.
- I'll go with you.

613
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,094
No, you will not.

614
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,514
Uri is a big fellow and it might take
two of us to carry him back.

615
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,265
Yeah, what if he's dead?

616
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,519
Don't say that. Uri knows how
to get the fuck out of here.

617
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,521
We might find new leads--

618
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,525
You saw what attacked the car.
He says that there's other things out here.

619
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,152
- Come on. Just stay here.
- Please!

620
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,488
- Please!
- Stay.

621
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,659
Yeah, I'm gonna come too.
I'm gonna help these guys, okay?

622
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,369
All right, let's go.

623
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,331
You stay in the car, you keep the door shut.
We'll be back for you.

624
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,710
You'll be all right, mate.
We'll be back. We'll be back.

625
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,547
- Stay with them. Help them.
- Michael, this is stupid.

626
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,882
- Why would you do that?
- I'll be back.

627
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,013
How well you know Uri?

628
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,516
Not well. You?

629
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,518
Same, same.

630
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,896
You think he's still here?

631
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,151
It's been overnight. He could be gone.

632
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,986
Yeah, I know.

633
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,240
What are you thinking?

634
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,660
I think Chris got attacked by dogs.

635
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,997
Dogs didn't do that.

636
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,418
Maybe a bear? I mean, we saw a bear
run by us at the apartment yesterday.

637
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:47,254
- He said there was something else.
- Yeah, and it could be a bear.

638
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,715
He said there was a lot of dogs.
It was dark, he was in shock.

639
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,800
Try the walkie-talkie, will you?

640
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,305
Hey, Uri, are you there? It's Paul.

641
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,727
- Let's go around here.
- Uri, can you hear me?

642
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:04,771
Just stay close
and keep your eyes open, all right?

643
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,066
I don't believe him when he said that
animals don't come out during the day.

644
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,944
Yeah. I don't know what to believe.

645
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,113
Fuck.

646
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,533
This is where he went off last night, right?

647
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,286
Let's just try and figure out how
we get back to the van.

648
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,829
Good idea, mate.

649
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,707
Check your walkie-talkie again.

650
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,752
Hey, Uri, this is Paul.
Can you hear me, buddy?

651
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,754
Whoa.

652
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,131
- What?
- Do it again, do it again, do it again.

653
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,300
Uri, do you come in--?

654
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,594
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

655
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,348
- Holy shit.
- You guys.

656
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,394
Something fucking got him.

657
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,940
Okay, let's go. We need to go.

658
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,483
No, we can't, mate.

659
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,277
We have to see if he's alive.

660
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,123
- Uri?
- Shh.

661
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,604
Uri?

662
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,952
Uri?

663
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,825
It's okay.

664
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,830
There's too much blood.

665
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,750
- There's no way that he's still alive.
- I know, I know.

666
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,210
We need to be smart about this.
We're not going back there.

667
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:36,256
We are. I'm gonna go.
Besides, he's got the gun.

668
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,217
He's right.

669
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,973
Let's do it.

670
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,789
Uri?

671
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,644
Uri!

672
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,772
PAUL
Uri!

673
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,733
Oh, fuck!

674
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,568
Holy shit!

675
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:40,946
Look!

676
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,659
Gotta check his pockets.

677
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,828
- Shit! Where's the gun?
- Oh, shit.

678
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,287
Wait. I've got the clip.

679
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,048
Lock the fucking door!

680
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,258
Oh, what the fuck is that?

681
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,219
- Holy shit!
- Gun, gun, gun!

682
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,471
- Fuck, there's no bullets!
- Right here!

683
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,975
All right, I got it! I'll do it!

684
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,811
Go!

685
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:24,985
Oh, shit!

686
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,140
Forget it!

687
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,225
Motherfucker.

688
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,660
We're getting the fuck out of here.

689
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,704
- What? Where are we going?
- What's going on?

690
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,623
- We gotta go.
- Where's Uri? Did you find him?

691
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,374
- Yeah, what's left of him.
- What?

692
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,335
What he said, man. Uri's dead.

693
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,545
- We better go, we can't stay here.
- He cannot walk.

694
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:28,882
- We can't stay here!
- I don't have a choice. Help me.

695
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,885
- What? Babe, no!
- Come on, I'll help you.

696
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,678
- Ah, fuck. Ow, ow, ow.
- Real slow.

697
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,847
- Just do it real slow.
- Easy, easy, easy.

698
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,223
All right.

699
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,810
- Fuck.
- There you go. There you go.

700
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,230
- Ow! Fuck!
- Goddamn it, I told you, he can't walk!

701
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,983
- Put it back up, put it back up.
- Easy, easy.

702
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,860
- What's going on?
- We gotta carry him.

703
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,071
- Don't be fucking stupid.
- We're not gonna leave you here!

704
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,532
It'll take three of you to carry me
and twice as long!

705
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,742
Fine. I'm staying here with him.

706
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,494
- I'm not leaving him!
- I'm not leaving him either!

707
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,287
Would you listen to me?

708
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:03,583
You live here. You're the only one
that speaks the language.

709
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,794
Go get help and bring it back.

710
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,382
We're staying in the van.

711
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,551
All right.

712
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,596
- Take this.
- We'll be back. Come on, Zoe.

713
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:17,931
Stay on channel one.

714
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:21,101
If you guys need anything,
if anything happens, you call us, okay?

715
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,187
It's 13 miles. We're gonna leave now.
If we hurry...

716
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,189
- ...we'll be back before it's dark.
- What if you're not back?

717
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,440
Take it.

718
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,276
- You know how to use that?
- Yeah, I think so.

719
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,112
All right, let's go.

720
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,905
- Paul, wait.
- We'll be back, mate.

721
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,198
Come on, let's go, Zoe.

722
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,283
- Look, I'm sorry--
- Stop. Stop.

723
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,827
I'm gonna get you home.

724
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,122
We'll be back before you know it.

725
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,419
It's okay, babe. It's okay.

726
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,464
Way to go, Paul.
Fucked things up this time.

727
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,925
Okay, don't think like that.
Come on, that's not helping anyone.

728
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:55,677
I've been doing this his whole fucking life.

729
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:58,513
I always get him into shit.
He always pays for it.

730
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,724
Well, despite all that, you're his big brother.

731
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,853
So right now he's counting on you
to get him out of this. Okay?

732
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,772
Oi! Oi!

733
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,488
Holy shit.

734
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,326
- Come on.
- We gotta find a way around.

735
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,661
- Michael.
- Stay quiet.

736
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,664
- We'll loop around.
- Oh, God. Okay, go. Go, go, go.

737
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,167
Zoe, Zoe! Come on.

738
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,811
Ah! Shit. Guys?

739
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,897
The radiation's getting worse.

740
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,899
Let's go.

741
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:59,199
Shh! What is that? Look.

742
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,713
Holy shit.

743
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,883
- Will any of them start?
- No, babe. The batteries would be dead.

744
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,844
We might be able to find some cables,
though. Check the cars. Let's go!

745
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,222
Oh, fuck.

746
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,766
Oi! Oi!

747
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,061
Jesus! What the fuck?

748
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,563
- Who would shoot at a bus?
- I don't know, babe.

749
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:31,981
The guards?

750
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,861
These are exit holes. Whatever was shooting,
was shooting from the inside out.

751
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,156
- Can we just find these cables, please?
- Yeah.

752
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,746
Paul?

753
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,085
Paul? Paul?!

754
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,517
Amanda, there's shells everywhere.

755
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,193
Maybe there's a gun in here.

756
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,113
Let's look.

757
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,136
Wait, no. No.
Let's get back to Michael and Zoe.

758
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:44,637
What if something's back there?

759
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,433
Goddamn it.

760
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,658
Nothing.

761
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,535
- Ahh!
- Oh, shit!

762
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,498
You okay?

763
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,169
Yeah.

764
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,796
Come on.

765
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,552
- Any bullets?
- No.

766
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,847
- It's broken, it won't fire.
- Look.

767
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,682
It works.

768
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,520
That's a piece of a guard uniform.

769
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,397
Let's get out of here.

770
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,024
Let's go.

771
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,527
Oi!

772
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,071
What?

773
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,282
- Is it the same one?
- Oh, yeah!

774
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,702
- Will it work? Do you think it'll work?
- I think so.

775
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,206
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Call your bro.

776
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,503
Hey, Natalie? This is Paul.
Are you guys there?

777
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,382
Yeah, we're here. Where are you guys?

778
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,802
You're not gonna believe this.
We got cables for the van.

779
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,220
When are you coming back?

780
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,889
We're heading back now.
How's my brother doing?

781
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,392
He's fine. Please hurry back.

782
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,603
Because we wanna get the fuck out of here.

783
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,776
Come on, come on!

784
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:24,946
Hey, Chris? You hang in there, buddy.
We're coming back for you right now!

785
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,656
We're on our way.

786
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,409
Come on, Zoe!

787
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,541
I can't run!

788
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,754
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Oh, my God!

789
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,424
This way. Here, here, here!

790
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,095
All right, come on, come on!

791
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:52,598
Come on!

792
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,808
Go, babe. Ahh!

793
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,185
You gotta go! You gotta go.

794
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,938
Keep moving, come on! Come on!

795
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,357
- You gotta go!
- All right, all right.

796
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,900
Come on, come on.

797
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,445
Zoe, you've gotta keep moving, babe!

798
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,280
- Zoe, it's okay.
- Come on, Zoe.

799
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,948
Yes!

800
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,950
- Come on, Zoe!
- You can do it, Zoe! Come on!

801
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,287
Keep moving!

802
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:15,955
- Zoe!
- Oh, no!

803
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,790
Oh, shit!

804
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,293
- Zoe!
- Zoe!

805
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,644
Michael!

806
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,566
- Get him out, get him out.
- Get him out.

807
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,902
- Oh, my leg! My leg!
- Are you okay?

808
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,239
- It's just a scratch. It's okay.
- Get him up. Let's get him up.

809
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,824
Pull me up!

810
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,160
- Come on!
- We gotta move!

811
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,037
- Look at me! Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

812
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,164
Guys, come on.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

813
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,749
Damn it!

814
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,264
- How's the leg?
- I'm all right, mate.

815
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,684
- I just want to get us out of here.
- Chris should be in Moscow right now.

816
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:23,189
Exactly, but he's not. So tell me what you
know so we can figure out what is going on.

817
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,565
Just urban legend, man.

818
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,609
They say this place isn't really abandoned.

819
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:29,195
Obviously, the radiation
hasn't killed everything.

820
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,239
- I don't believe any of that shit.
- Why not can't you believe it?

821
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,283
There's so much that's been going on,
there's people gotta be out here doing this shit.

822
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,702
- Think about it!
- There has to be something. He's right.

823
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,454
- I mean, think about it.
- Chris.

824
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,707
Uri. That thing in the kitchen.
What was that?

825
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,919
And I swear there was something
in a photo I took the other day.

826
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,879
I didn't think anything of it at the time, but--

827
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,048
- See? The photo.
- It was a shadow--

828
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,801
It didn't make sense at the time,
nothing had happened then.

829
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,719
Listen. Listen, okay? Listen.

830
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,980
- Zoe, come on.
- Come on, let's go!

831
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,319
What? This is where we were.

832
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,447
- Maybe they got it started?
- And they wouldn't call us?

833
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,741
- Natalie?
- Wait, look! Over here.

834
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,454
What? Is that from the van?

835
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,914
Oh, my God.

836
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,583
What the fuck?

837
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:31,007
- Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
- Chris!

838
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,509
- Chris!
- Shh!

839
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:41,934
Fuck!

840
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,730
- Chris!
- Keep it down, mate.

841
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,445
Hey, come here!

842
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,947
Hey, guys! It's recording.

843
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,991
What, what?

844
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,160
I don't know. It's Chris.

845
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,707
- What are you talking about?
- Just listen.

846
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,879
- I love you, Natalie.
- I love you, too, baby.

847
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,465
- I love you so much.
- I know.

848
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,676
I just need you to know that.

849
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,346
I was gonna wait till Moscow, but--

850
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,847
No, babe, wait till Moscow.

851
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,516
We're gonna be there tomorrow and then
you can do everything as planned, okay?

852
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,310
I know, but I just--

853
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:26,854
What was that?

854
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,815
Babe, grab the camera. Shine it over here.

855
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,567
- Is that them?
- I don't know.

856
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,028
- Can you see anything?
- I don't see anybody.

857
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,906
- Is it Paul?
- I don't know.

858
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:20,241
- What the fuck is happening? No--
- Keep it down.

859
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:22,034
- Chris!
- Keep your shit together.

860
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,327
Stay the fuck away from me!

861
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,871
Shit! Just keep it down.

862
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,249
- I'm not leaving my brother!
- He's not here.

863
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,377
- Chris!
- What was that?

864
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,462
- Chris? Chris? Chris!
- Please, be quiet.

865
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:34,922
Shit!

866
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,841
Chris!

867
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:40,052
We can't leave them.
We can't leave them. We need to find them.

868
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,139
We need to find them! Please! Let's go!
Please, Michael, we need to find them.

869
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,391
- Fucking hell!
- Please!

870
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,948
There, through there.

871
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,873
Careful.

872
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:16,922
Oh, Chris!

873
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,382
Wait!

874
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,184
Chris?

875
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,942
Natalie?

876
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,338
Is that Chris?

877
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,302
Chris?

878
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:15,815
Chris?!

879
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:17,983
Come on, he's not here.

880
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:31,497
Baby, we have to, he's got the gun.
Come on.

881
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,005
Chris?

882
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,346
Nat?

883
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,932
Chris?

884
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,690
- He's not here.
- I heard him. I heard him.

885
01:02:57,858 --> 01:03:00,109
- Paul! We have to go!
- We can't stay here. Let's go.

886
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,944
Come on, please?
Please, mate, we'll find him.

887
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,404
I'm sorry. Come on.

888
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,206
Run!

889
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:19,545
Natalie! Natalie.

890
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,718
Come on. Come on, Nat, come on!

891
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,970
- Oh, Jesus!
- Come on! This way, this way!

892
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,974
I got her! I got her!
Okay, you're okay, baby. You're okay.

893
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,225
Michael!

894
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,728
I got you. It's okay.

895
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,897
It's a fucking map. Look!

896
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,025
Natalie, where's Chris?

897
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,737
- Natalie, where's Chris?!
- Shh. Shh. Paul!

898
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:47,281
What happened to my brother?
While we're going this way, he's in there!

899
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,575
Hey, leave her alone!

900
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,076
Shit.

901
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,579
Natalie, where's Chris?

902
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,748
All right, hold this, hold this.

903
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,918
That's the road we came in on.

904
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,921
So then we came on to the checkpoint,
and that's another checkpoint.

905
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,423
And we're here.
Hey, there's another checkpoint!

906
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,468
It's close. We can get there.
We'll find help and come back. I promise.

907
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,595
- I can't leave yet.
- I understand, but we gotta go.

908
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,138
I'm not leaving without my brother!

909
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,265
We need to! We don't even know
if Chris is still--

910
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,435
Don't you fucking say that!
Don't you fucking say that!

911
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:21,106
Give me the gun! Back off! Back off!
I'm sorry, mate. We want to help you.

912
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,901
We'll find your brother, I promise,
but we gotta go. We need help.

913
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,611
Please? Please?

914
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:26,904
Paul, Paul?

915
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,450
No, Paul! We're gonna find Chris but we
are no good to him if we're dead, okay?

916
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,537
Listen to me! Listen to me, Paul, okay?

917
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,705
We're gonna go find help
and we're gonna come back...

918
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,624
...and we're gonna get your brother, okay?

919
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,251
We need to get out of here.
Show me the map again.

920
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:44,964
Right now, I need you to get it together.
For everyone else's sake and mine.

921
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,340
All right?

922
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:54,974
Come on!

923
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:04,108
That doesn't make sense.

924
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,736
The radiation's getting worse.

925
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:12,533
We've got to keep going. Come on.
We've got to keep going, come on!

926
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:13,742
Zoe, come on.

927
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,578
- Here, Michael, it doesn't make sense.
- What do you mean?

928
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,664
Because the map says
that we're supposed to be here?

929
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,833
- We gotta go that way.
- No, but look.

930
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,751
It says that this way is supposed to--

931
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,421
Michael, look at it, it stops!

932
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,215
- Then we have to go back.
- Which way do we have to go?

933
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:32,511
- If we go back here--
- I know it's not. Zoe, Zoe, please?

934
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,347
- Michael, no, we have to go!
- Guys, guys!

935
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,017
What the fuck?

936
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:43,856
Wait!

937
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:46,650
Hello?

938
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,581
What are you saying?

939
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,185
Natalie!

940
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:23,187
Oh, my God!

941
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,024
No!

942
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,402
- Where is she?
- She's gone!

943
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,365
Natalie!

944
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,120
Listen, listen!

945
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,539
This way, this way!

946
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,041
Zoe, stay in front of me.

947
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,261
Holy shit! That's a guard!

948
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,098
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go!

949
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,975
Natalie?

950
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,025
Natalie?!

951
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,447
Nat!

952
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,283
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

953
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,962
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

954
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,964
Move, move, move! Come on!

955
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,133
Michael! Michael!

956
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,302
- Fuck, there's too many!
- Come on!

957
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:44,143
Where the fuck are they?
Keep going, keep going.

958
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:01,869
Come on!

959
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,081
Hurry the fuck up!

960
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,258
Boxes! Shut the fucking door!

961
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,010
Push! Push!

962
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:20,804
They're coming!

963
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,685
Grab another one!

964
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,359
- Kick it!
- There's another room back here!

965
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:35,903
Michael, come on!

966
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,030
Zoe, just get going! Go, go, go!

967
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,865
- Michael!
- I'm coming!

968
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,617
- Go, get in, get in.
- Michael!

969
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,327
Zoe, will you go on!

970
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,830
Zoe, get inside!

971
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,874
Close the door.

972
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,670
- Push it! Push it!
- It's stuck!

973
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,547
Michael, get in! Get in!

974
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:58,884
Michael!

975
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,386
No, we have to go.

976
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,278
Go!

977
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,092
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.

978
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,468
It's okay.

979
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,262
No, no, no, no, Zoe!

980
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,972
Get up, Zoe, come on.

981
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,350
I got you, I got you. Come on.

982
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,853
What is this place?

983
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:04,593
Shit.

984
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,277
Not down. Not down.

985
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,030
Fuck!

986
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,491
Go! Go!

987
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,203
Oh, fuck. Put the light on!

988
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:39,044
Put the fucking light on!

989
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,905
Oh, fuck.

990
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,074
This must be where they were living.

991
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:12,035
Keep moving. Come on, keep moving.

992
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,996
- Chris? Chris?!
- Shh!

993
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:28,927
Chris?

994
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,268
Go, go, go!

995
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:42,983
Which way?

996
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:44,401
Come on, I'll help you.

997
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,695
- Paul, go!
- Give me your hand.

998
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,200
- Oh, my God! They're coming!
- Give me your hand!

999
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,079
Come on! Give me your hand!
Give me your hand! Pull!

1000
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:04,087
Don't let go, Zoe!

1001
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,259
No!

1002
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,809
No! No!

1003
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,248
Up here, up here.

1004
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,837
Come on, come on!

1005
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,049
Paul?

1006
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,803
I let them all go.

1007
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,639
It's my fault.

1008
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:02,312
Come on, come on. We can still find them.

1009
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:04,356
We can still find them.

1010
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:10,070
Come on, let's just go.
We can still find them. Come on.

1011
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:12,572
Please? Just take my hand. Come on.

1012
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:14,991
We gotta get out of here.

1013
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,715
There's something wrong with my eyes.

1014
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,134
Oh, fuck.

1015
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,136
My face is burning.

1016
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,221
Fuck, you look all blurry.

1017
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,473
What is that?

1018
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,852
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1019
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:44,312
Come on! Come on! Please, hurry!

1020
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,566
- Everything's blurry.
- I know. I got you. Come on.

1021
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,861
We gotta find a way out of here
before the radiation kills us.

1022
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,157
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, go. I'm fine.

1023
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,374
Careful. Okay.

1024
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,211
Oh, no.

1025
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:20,849
I'm so sorry, Amanda.

1026
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,601
No.

1027
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,197
Amanda, we can't stay here.

1028
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,866
We can't stay here. We have to go.

1029
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,912
And I can't leave without you,
so please, let's just go.

1030
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,225
- Wait.
- A way out.

1031
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,479
Oh, fuck.

1032
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,148
Holy shit.

1033
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,807
Run! Run!

1034
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,161
I can't see anything.

1035
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,837
- I can't see....
- Help!

1036
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,631
- Help!
- Help!

1037
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,174
Help!

1038
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,218
Help! Ugh....

1039
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:23,555
- We need help!
- Help!

1040
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,473
Please!

1041
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:29,686
SOLDIER :

1042
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:30,979
Help us, please!

1043
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:36,067
- Please, help us!
- Please, stop!

1044
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,570
Please!

1045
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:39,863
No!

1046
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:18,902
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?
What is your name?

1047
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,612
Where are you taking me?

1048
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:21,780
My face!

1049
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,616
It's okay. How did you get into Pripyat?

1050
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,701
There were people. They were chasing us.

1051
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,705
Yes, patients, victim of radiation.
They escaped.

1052
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,457
You saw them, yes?

1053
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,125
They killed my friends.

1054
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,921
- Anyone else know you're here?
- No.

1055
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,343
Where are you taking me?

1056
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,847
What is this place?

1057
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:52,894
We're in the hospital.
We're taking you to doctor.

1058
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:56,022

My skin is burning.

1066
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:16,584
You were inside reactor.
It's extremely dangerous.

1067
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:20,630
Okay.

1068
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,340
We will help.

1069
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,429

1070
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,313

Who's there?
