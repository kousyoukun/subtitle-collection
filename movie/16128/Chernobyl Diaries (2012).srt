1
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,640
Bye, L.A.!

2
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,239
Here we go.

3
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,562
My friends are morons.

4
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,424
You better be careful, you might
end up in the Tower of London.

5
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,495
Criminal.

6
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,914
But it's gonna be you.

7
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,319
- Forget the plane.
- This is backwards, by the way.

8
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,766
And here in front of us,
we have the beautiful...

9
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,958
Danube river.

10
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,397
We're doing Prague.

11
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,537
Hi, Paul! We're at
the Tower of London!

12
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,446
Here we come, Kiev. We're
coming to see you, Paul.

13
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,573
You guys are ridiculous.

14
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,141
- Dude, it was so much fun, man.
- Yeah, I can imagine.

15
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,809
Hey, ladies! You wanna
put your stuff away?

16
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,844
- Sure.
- Some place you got here, Paul.

17
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:52,878
I'm never leaving.

18
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,620
Best place ever. Ain't
it right, Chris?

19
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,882
- I got it, it's fine.
- I'll take it. I got it. I insist.

20
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:57,983
Where are we sleeping?

21
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,418
I told you, I put a pillow
on the patio for you.

22
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,153
"I told you, I put a pillow
on the patio for you."

23
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,621
You're sleeping in my room! Where
do you think you're sleeping?

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,424
Oh, great. Even better. Some
chick still sleeping in there?

25
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,425
Quite possibly.

26
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,560
I hope you cleaned those sheets.
Or burned them.

27
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,835
I heard that!

28
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,342
- So, Kiev, huh?
- Kiev, baby!

29
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,803
I thought for sure your add
would have kicked in by now.

30
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,045
Dude, I'm telling you, man.
I don't think I'm leaving.

31
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,649
I love it here! The chicks,
they're fuckin' amazing.

32
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:28,380
They absolutely love Americans and
they are completely fucking insane.

33
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,941
Yeah, well, they have to be if
they want anything to do with you.

34
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,718
- So, Amanda.
- Yeah, okay.

35
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,353
- What? Chris!
- I knew this was coming.

36
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,420
Come on.

37
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,590
Rob literally broke up with her three
weeks before we were supposed...

38
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,859
To come out here and Natalie had
to drag her ass onto the airplane.

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,396
Perfect! Look at her.

40
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,364
She's lonely, she's in Europe.

41
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,766
Best way to get over an ex is with a fling.
I could be her fling.

42
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,668
- You're a sick son-of-a-bitch.
- I'm not sick, dude!

43
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,807
Would you stop?

44
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,272
- Do I have a shot with her?
- No, you don't.

45
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,809
- No? All right.
- Zero. Fine.

46
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,722
- I'll leave it alone.
- Thank you.

47
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,093
What about you and Natalie?
You guys going good?

48
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,484
It's creepy when you look
at me like that, dude.

49
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,789
Hold this.

50
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,964
Are you serious?

51
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,524
Are you serious?

52
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,163
Yeah, dude!

53
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,304
I haven't asked her yet. I'm
gonna propose in Moscow.

54
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,631
- Does she have any idea?
- Ah, well, I hope not.

55
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:20,975
- What about Amanda?
- No.

56
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,775
That's awesome, dude.

57
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,355
Unbelievable.

58
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,783
A fucking riot.

59
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,350
Oh, man, thank you so much.
This was such a good night.

60
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,451
Yeah, it was.

61
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,187
Told you, man. Okay. Save it
for the apartment. Get a room!

62
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,168
Go to town, we're in Europe!
Don't listen to him.

63
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,059
- Whoa! You all right?
- Hello! Thank you, good save.

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,041
Watch out! These cobblestones,
they'll get you.

65
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,501
Thank you for being a good host.
We've had a lot of fun.

66
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,239
My pleasure. You enjoying
yourself in Kiev?

67
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,038
I am! Yes, it's a
beautiful little city.

68
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,679
- It's not bad, right?
- Yeah, it's great.

69
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,147
Wait till Moscow.

70
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,916
Wait until you get to Moscow.
You believe me?

71
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,147
I don't know.

72
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,685
Do you trust me? I don't trust
you in those heels. Come here.

73
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,031
- Paul. Hands off!
- Sorry.

74
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,426
- You're trouble.
- I am trouble!

75
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,298
I can't promise what's gonna happen
at the end of the road, but...

76
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,039
Don't fall.

77
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,133
Those stairs are slippery.

78
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,734
Please, lock your door tonight.
I don't trust him.

79
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,941
- Christopher.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,516
- You are visiting your brother in Kiev.
- Yeah, well, I had to chase you down.

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,400
I didn't know when you booked this
trip, it was a one-way ticket.

82
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,182
I missed you, buddy.

83
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,839
Yeah, I missed you too, man.
It's good to see you.

84
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,986
- How are things back home? Good?
- Yeah, things are great.

85
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,128
Mom's worried sick, of course.
You know how she is.

86
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,396
You spoken to Dad?

87
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,694
No, I, uh... no.

88
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,928
- You should call him.
- I know I should.

89
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,136
- Paul, which way should we go?
- Left.

90
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,009
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want
any trouble, seriously.

91
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,181
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

92
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,957
- Good night.
- Have a good night.

93
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,751
Good night. Bye-bye.

94
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,026
Come on, come on, come on.

95
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,556
- Fucking losers.
- Real friendly people here.

96
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,037
Don't worry about it. We
got a big day tomorrow.

97
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,701
Okay, I'm assuming that this is the
breakfast menu? But I don't know.

98
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,140
Excuse me, is...

99
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,340
Yeah, she hasn't had
her coffee yet.

100
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,573
Where's Paul? He's supposed
to help us with this.

101
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,275
I don't know, I just
want something greasy.

102
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,077
Can you just point out
something greasy, please?

103
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,751
You need the hangover special.

104
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,783
Amanda, I want to apologize for
Paul's behaviour last night.

105
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,993
Oh, please. He's fine. I mean,
I know the type, you know?

106
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,891
Just all talk.

107
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,524
Yeah, well, with him, it's
not always just talk.

108
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,760
I can handle him, I'm not too
worried about it. You know?

109
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,663
And I'm sure, deep
down in there...

110
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,032
- Very deep down, very...
- Somewhere...

111
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,135
He's a good guy, you know?
It's just an act, that's all.

112
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,003
I mean, he's related to you, baby,
and you turned out all right.

113
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,638
- That's true.
- Yeah, you're okay.

114
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,607
That's true. Just let me know if
I need to kick his ass for you.

115
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,175
- Thanks, dude. Hello!
- Morning, children.

116
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,543
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

117
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,579
- How are you?
- Fantastic.

118
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,787
So, I know I said we're
going to Moscow.

119
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,518
But I'm gonna ask you a
question, and I want an answer.

120
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,930
The answer is already no.

121
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,255
You guys ever heard
of Chernobyl?

122
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,701
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

123
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,059
Isn't that where the
nuclear disaster happened?

124
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,405
Yes. I met this really
cool guy, Uri, who's a...

125
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,171
Have you heard of
extreme tourism?

126
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,134
Somehow, I haven't, no.

127
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,468
You guys see where
this is going, right?

128
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,170
We're going to Moscow,
as we talked about.

129
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,117
Chris? Can I please finish?

130
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,543
So, there's this place called Pripyat.
It's a town right next to Chernobyl.

131
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:55,280
Uri, who is very excited to take us
there, is an extreme tour guide.

132
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,490
He's gonna show us this city
that was abandoned overnight.

133
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,192
Literally. They had no
time to take anything.

134
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,995
Factories, schools, stores, homes,
apartments, everything's still there.

135
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,926
Imagine the photo shoot you
can have there, Amanda?

136
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,263
Yeah, but, radiation
levels or something.

137
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,065
- It's probably pretty dangerous, right?
- We're only gonna be there for a day.

138
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,273
A few hours, see some cool
shit and then we split.

139
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,037
- How are we gonna get there?
- Uri's gonna take us.

140
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,472
- He's got a van.
- A van?

141
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,873
- Yeah.
- He has a van?

142
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,114
He has a van!

143
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,781
Okay...

144
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,548
Aside from the sketchy
van situation...

145
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,791
And if you promise that
this tour is safe...

146
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,717
I think it could be kinda cool.

147
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,352
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You're kidding.

148
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,522
No. I mean-I don't know.
He's right.

149
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,890
We're in Europe, we
might as well...

150
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,293
See as much as we possibly
can while we're here.

151
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,272
I don't know.

152
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,930
- Tell me you don't want to meet Uri.
- I don't want to meet Uri.

153
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,231
How can you say that? You
haven't even met him yet.

154
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,167
Okay, we'll take some pictures, explore
a bit, and then we'll be on our way.

155
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,546
Just as planned. Right?

156
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,505
I don't like that he's
rubbing off on you.

157
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,340
He's definitely not rubbing off.

158
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,008
You're incredible,
you know that?

159
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,409
All right, let's just settle
this by a show of hands, please?

160
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,656
Who's coming with
Paul to Chernobyl?

161
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,254
- Yeah!
- You're kidding me, right?

162
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,563
You guys are so weak.

163
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,203
All right, kids! Welcome to Uri's
extreme travel. Let's do it.

164
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,562
Welcome to Uri's extreme.

165
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,940
Uri!

166
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,036
What's up, buddy?

167
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,004
Good morning.

168
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,978
- Come in! Welcome, welcome.
- All right, man! The gang is all here.

169
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,007
- This is my little brother Chris.
- How you doing?

170
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,977
His girlfriend Natalie.
The lovely Amanda.

171
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,845
- Guys, this is Uri.
- Hi.

172
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,847
Hello.

173
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,282
So, I was telling them about
our little adventure today...

174
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,194
And Chris got
parental, as usual.

175
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,186
So I figured you'd give him
a little peace of mind...

176
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,393
Before he pisses his pants.

177
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,634
- You're feeling, uh, nervous?
- No, I'm not. I'm not nervous.

178
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:49,031
It's a nice shop you got here,
it's very, uh, professional.

179
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,001
Thank you. It's all mine.

180
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,103
- It's all yours, huh?
- Yeah, very nice.

181
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,768
- Yes, it's all mine.
- Well, what are you, ex-military?

182
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,436
Yes, special forces.

183
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,438
What does it matter if he's
a fuckin' magician, dude?

184
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,941
I'm just asking a
fucking question.

185
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,075
Okay. Uri, what's the plan for today?
What are we doing?

186
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,319
Well, this is a very
well organized tour.

187
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,983
I've been taking special adventurous
tourists for a while now...

188
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:15,053
So you should feel
very, how do you say?

189
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,398
- Special?
- Special, I like that.

190
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:23,197
Okay, so imagine, you have big city
and no one's there. All to yourself.

191
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,030
Is it safe?

192
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,444
Of course it's safe. This is
not my first rodeo, Natalika.

193
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,210
- So sorry we're late!
- We're here.

194
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,639
Hey, you guys are for
the special tour, yeah?

195
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,017
Yeah!

196
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,209
I'm Michael, this
is my viking Zoe.

197
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,412
How you doing? Chris.
Nice to meet.

198
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,247
What's up, man? I'm Paul.
Nice to meet you, buddy.

199
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,949
- Okay, we go!
- We go now.

200
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,985
- Come, come.
- All right.

201
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,385
Sweet.

202
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,120
- We didn't keep you waiting?
- No. You guys are fine.

203
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,056
Zoe, I told you!
Go with the flow!

204
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,333
So, tell me, what's up with
the whole viking thing?

205
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,661
He calls me that all the time.
I'm from Norway, so...

206
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,972
And he's my Australian
surfer dude.

207
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,839
All right, let's rock and roll!

208
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,010
Yes.

209
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,732
Yeah, buddy! Are you kidding?

210
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,114
That's what we're riding in?

211
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,723
- Might as well just... roll with it.
- Put your bags in the back.

212
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,550
First time there?

213
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,919
Pripyat? Yeah. How
about you guys?

214
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,730
Yeah. How about you guys?

215
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,995
Yes. Someone said that
it's pretty fantastic.

216
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,525
- You two sweethearts Moonin'?
- "Moonin" '?

217
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,194
- Are we what?
- Honeymooning.

218
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,229
Yeah, actually, we
are honeymooning.

219
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,631
We're just friends. Barely.

220
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,373
You're cute.

221
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,906
- Are you guys?
- Oh, yeah, we're timeless.

222
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,770
A month.

223
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,172
You guys have only been together a month?
God bless.

224
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,811
These two are
practically married.

225
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,249
- We go.
- Shotgun!

226
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,788
Thank you.

227
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,363
Anybody gets hungry,
I have beef jerky.

228
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,929
Pripyat is two hours from here, and
Chernobyl is not far from there.

229
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,163
Good time!

230
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,365
What exactly happened
in Chernobyl?

231
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:11,610
The Chernobyl disaster was a
result of failed systems tests.

232
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,172
It caused sudden power surge.

233
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,154
And reactor number four
became one with the air.

234
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,878
- One with the air?
- Vaporized.

235
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,017
It exploded.

236
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,430
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

237
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,965
Nature has reclaimed
its rightful home.

238
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,048
Here we are.

239
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,451
Welcome to Pripyat.

240
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,086
Photo.

241
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,123
We're now entering
exclusion zone.

242
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,434
How long is it safe to be here?

243
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:12,139
It's very safe. We'll only
be in Pripyat for two hours.

244
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,132
What is this place? Is
it like a checkpoint?

245
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,441
Looks like it.

246
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,148
Why would there be a checkpoint
at an abandoned town?

247
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,944
Tourists.

248
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,413
Okay...

249
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,278
- Let me do the talking.
- Well, you think?

250
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,953
- Put your cameras away.
- Yeah, got it.

251
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,560
Look at this guy over there.

252
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,901
These guys look pretty serious.

253
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,232
I don't know what they're saying,
but this guy is saying no.

254
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,770
Look at this guy.

255
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,102
What do you think is going on?

256
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,177
It's scary!

257
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,782
God, look at that guy.
He's huge.

258
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,455
- Thanks, baby.
- Come on, you.

259
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,586
Hide me so he doesn't see me.
How's that?

260
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,828
- You have a criminal soul?
- Do I look like one of them?

261
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,148
He is not letting us in today.
There's maintenance going on.

262
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,949
Maintenance work? I thought you
said this place was abandoned.

263
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,052
It is unusual.

264
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,778
Usually, they let me
know in advance...

265
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,622
...if something like this
is going to happen.

266
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,229
Wait, I thought you said everything
was gonna be taken care of.

267
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,032
- We paid for this tour, bro.
- I know, I know.

268
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,101
Don't worry.

269
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,460
There's more than one
way into Pripyat.

270
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,804
Make it happen.

271
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,147
It's so bizarre, I don't
see any birds or anything.

272
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,323
This must be Uri's
special entrance.

273
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,431
Paul, this looks
fuckin' sketchy, man.

274
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:20,002
Stop being a pussy. We came all this
way, enjoy yourself, all right?

275
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,832
It's called being sensible.

276
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,872
This is not right, you guys.

277
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,913
We're gonna end up in a
Ukrainian jail or something.

278
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,052
Come on, just think of
it as an adventure.

279
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,857
It's okay.

280
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,383
- This is the awesomest.
- Really?

281
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,695
Okay, no problem. Today we
have Pripyat to ourselves.

282
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,240
- Sweet.
- All right.

283
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,147
Here we go.

284
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,136
I was not expecting
a lake out here.

285
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,736
And there is Pripyat.

286
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,508
Home to the workers and
families of Chernobyl.

287
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,951
It's incredible.

288
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,983
Hold on! This is going
to be a little bumpy.

289
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,190
A little bumpy.

290
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,999
Oh, you're not gonna...

291
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,532
And down we go!

292
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,131
And up!

293
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,769
Oh, my God!

294
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,617
When are you putting seat
belts in this thing?

295
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,155
- Jesus.
- Or barf-bags.

296
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,451
It's ridiculous.

297
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,991
Okay. Now, I want to show
you something in water.

298
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,399
He wants to show us
something in water.

299
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,060
Thank you.

300
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,768
After you. After you.

301
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,802
- Stay close behind me.
- Like we're gonna go anywhere.

302
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,180
- Paul?
- Yeah?

303
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,445
I want you to tell me if you see
something moving in water. Okay?

304
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,214
Okay...

305
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,285
You don't want to get
your booties wet.

306
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,832
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

307
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,574
You okay? You okay, mate?

308
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,039
Funny, bugger.

309
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,041
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- He's a fucking comedian.

310
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,209
- It's jerky.
- Jerky, you jerk.

311
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,444
Hey, guys, can we go, please?

312
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,322
- Fucking got me!
- Yeah. He got me, too.

313
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,720
Oh, shit!

314
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,395
It was a joke.

315
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,590
Sorry about that.

316
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,589
Come have look at this.

317
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,762
Is this another joke?

318
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,205
No. No, come.

319
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,442
Holy cow.

320
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,200
- Don't get too close.
- Why? It's dead.

321
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,238
- It's disgusting.
- Look at the chompers on him.

322
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,415
What is that thing?

323
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,248
Touch it, mate.

324
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,787
Who's the pussy now, huh?

325
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,157
- Can we go? This is disgusting.
- Keep it up.

326
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,555
Can we go? That's disgusting.

327
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,433
- That's awesome.
- And moving on.

328
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,433
See its teeth? It's cool, huh?

329
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,129
Oh, my God!

330
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,924
- Did you just make a rhyme, Uri?
- Yes.

331
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,016
Make small joke.

332
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,552
- Not to worry.
- Here is Uri.

333
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,921
So, Uri, how long has this
place been abandoned?

334
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:48,159
It's been 25 years. Only recently
have radiation levels gone down.

335
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,630
Man, this is crazy.
It's creepy as fuck.

336
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:58,269
We are back on main road. It's
only way in and out of Pripyat.

337
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,614
Yeah, except for your
shortcut, right?

338
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:07,114
This is where the
families Chernobyl lived.

339
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,917
- See?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,853
- These were all full at one point.
- Yes. Very sad.

341
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,131
Fifty thousand people,
families, just left.

342
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,943
Okay, hold on. Little
bump, little bump.

343
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,472
- The Ferris.
- All right.

344
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,544
- I used to love those things.
- We're here.

345
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,021
Still want to go home, Chris?

346
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,416
I'm happy we're here. Thanks.

347
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,297
- You're welcome.
- There we go. Brotherly love.

348
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,566
Guys, look at this.

349
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,446
Ah, man.

350
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,508
Okay, everyone.

351
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,182
Stay near me and you'll be safe.

352
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,412
I have geiger counter.

353
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,048
It will let us know if the
radiation levels are high.

354
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,687
That's good.

355
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,298
Levels are good.

356
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,959
Can you guys imagine this like,
full with kids? Like... playing?

357
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,100
- It's really sad, actually.
- They had no idea.

358
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,008
I mean, this is
just unbelievable.

359
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,610
I have never seen
anything like this.

360
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,749
It's like they were getting ready
for a carnival or something.

361
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,683
They were preparing for
"may day", the celebration of spring.

362
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,828
Never happened.

363
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,957
Okay, let's go. This way.

364
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,165
Can we get a photo? Uri, you
want to take it? A photo.

365
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,040
- Hey, guys?
- All right. Quick photo.

366
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,234
And new friends.

367
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,742
Okay...

368
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,515
Good.

369
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,845
It's so American.

370
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,979
In a way, it's like...

371
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,712
There was life, and it just...

372
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,134
Hey, you hear that?

373
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,372
Silence.

374
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,640
It's like nature
really has taken over.

375
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,110
One last thing.

376
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,627
- Are we going in?
- Yes.

377
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,635
What is it, babe? Whoa, Zoe.
Hey, babe, it's okay.

378
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:57,503
They usually don't come so close to town.
Must have been starving.

379
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,049
I reckon he's right.

380
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,918
Come in.

381
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,478
That's disgusting.

382
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,688
That's the V.I.P.  entrance.
Treatment.

383
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,117
Poor guy...

384
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,029
Are there any other
animals here?

385
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,000
Unlikely. Especially
during the day.

386
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,230
Just you.

387
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,955
Stop it.

388
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,930
Here's one of a thousand
apartments that were abandoned.

389
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,330
Cool.

390
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,732
The people were not even
given five minutes...

391
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,713
To collect their
personal possessions.

392
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,772
You can't take that.
It's contaminated.

393
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,642
I was just look... spot the convict.
Cheers, man.

394
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,986
It's contaminated.

395
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:19,486
For a while, people came here and
they looted through these buildings.

396
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,832
They took these things,
sold them on black market.

397
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,955
People who bought
them got sick...

398
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,596
Not knowing they were
contaminated by radiation.

399
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,199
Sorry, I was just...

400
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,498
Come, let's have a look.

401
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,466
But it's okay to be
here and breathe?

402
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,502
Yes, yes.

403
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,576
We're not here long
enough to get exposure.

404
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,378
Chernobyl reactor number four.
Where the disaster happened.

405
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,747
- That's pretty close.
- Have you, you been inside?

406
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,617
No. You can only go inside
with radiation suit.

407
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,757
Only for short period of time.

408
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,627
Here, take picture.

409
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,561
- Take a nice, romantic photo?
- All right, all right.

410
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,836
Hey, I wasn't gonna...

411
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,844
- Yeah, he was.
- This is going on the fridge.

412
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,935
That's a metaphor here,
by the way, guys.

413
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,169
Do tell.

414
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,980
- That's beautiful.
- Our love is just exploding.

415
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,848
Oh, God.

416
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,476
The one good thing
about the radiation...

417
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,548
Is that I'll probably
finally grow a penis.

418
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,789
These guys are funny.

419
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,291
I know, I know.

420
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,126
- Can you beat that kiss?
- What?

421
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,978
We should go now.

422
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,926
It's going to get dark soon, we
should get back to van before then.

423
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,157
Fuck was that?

424
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,531
Right, it's gonna be a trick.

425
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,423
Stay.

426
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,344
Fuck is that?

427
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,624
Holy shit! Go, go, go!

428
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,797
- Jesus!
- Motherfucker!

429
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,095
Oh, my God!

430
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,729
Fuck!

431
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,931
- Is everyone okay?
- Don't fucking stand there!

432
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,466
Let's go, move, move, move!

433
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,605
Go!

434
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,914
Fuck! What the fuck was that?

435
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,071
Go, go.

436
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,144
Black bear or it's a fucking brown bear?
Oh, Jesus!

437
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,345
- What is a bear doing here?
- Can we just get the fuck out of here?

438
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,950
- Jeez.
- Watch out for that.

439
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,521
Oh, fuck!

440
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,589
- Okay.
- Holy shit.

441
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,299
- Can we just get the fuck out of here?
- Yes.

442
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,698
- Thanks for that.
- Yeah. Don't mention it.

443
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,030
Told you it'd be
exciting, didn't I?

444
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,565
Yeah, almost getting
mauled to death...

445
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,240
By a radioactive bear from hell?
It's pretty exciting.

446
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,009
Anybody else have a
story like this?

447
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,071
- Funny.
- You okay?

448
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,449
Anyone get a photo?

449
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,113
A photo. This guy.

450
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:06,713
Jesus.

451
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,118
Bear! Bear, bear! I'm kidding.

452
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,129
That's bad.

453
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,562
So, Uri, all the animals,
they stay in the woods, huh?

454
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,595
It's very unusual.

455
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,965
I've been doing this for five years.
I've never seen anything like this.

456
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,199
It's kind of chilly
out here, huh?

457
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,703
A dog, a wolf. But
a bear, very odd.

458
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,181
- It was exciting, right?
- Yeah, mate.

459
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,520
No extra charge for bear attack.

460
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,942
Say goodbye to Pripyat.

461
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,219
- Ciao.
- Yeah, ciao-ciao.

462
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,651
Hey, Christopher?

463
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,958
Moscow! Thank you.

464
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,119
- I'll have to get your e-mail, eh?
- Yeah, for sure, dude.

465
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,589
- Catch up again? I'll be back to Kiev.
- Done, dude.

466
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,124
- It was a blast.
- It's been a pleasure.

467
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,729
Turn the heater on, buddy.

468
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,468
Pump it.

469
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,873
Give it some gas.

470
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,103
- What's up, is there gas in there?
- Yes. Half a tank.

471
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,043
Is it the starter, mate?

472
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,114
Has this happened before?

473
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,984
I don't suppose you guys
have triple a out here?

474
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,759
Do you have reception?

475
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,753
I haven't had reception all day, guys.
There's no kind of reception out here.

476
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,062
Look, look.

477
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,601
What the fuck could've
done that, mate?

478
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,667
That's fucking been chewed on.

479
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,201
- Wait, what's happening?
- What's going on?

480
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,633
- The wires have been destroyed.
- Chewed on.

481
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,769
What do you mean chewed on?
What, by what? An animal?

482
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,408
What kind of animal
chews on car parts?

483
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,073
Are you sure we're
out here alone?

484
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,676
Yes. You heard the soldiers this
morning, this place is off-limits.

485
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,951
We are here alone.

486
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,587
What the fuck is it, Michael?

487
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,517
That's the spark-plug
leads, been chewed on...

488
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,958
- Can you call someone?
- By a raccoon, a rat, or some animal.

489
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,055
But how would an
animal get in here?

490
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,123
Under the car.
Through the engine.

491
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,331
- Underneath?
- Yeah, yeah.

492
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,768
He said there aren't any around
here and all of a sudden...

493
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,747
I don't know.

494
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,648
Guys! Let's just shut up and
let him-we're trying to-to...

495
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,089
Fuck me.

496
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:35,904
Uri?

497
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,971
What's the plan, mate?

498
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,545
Hey, big fella? What's the plan?

499
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,046
I'm so hungry, I could die.

500
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,725
Well, this is great.

501
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,131
Gotta hand it to you. Some
fucking tour, mister.

502
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,500
- This is not my fault.
- Oh, really? Not your fault?

503
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,526
Cause last time I checked, you were
the one that drove us out here.

504
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,127
Well, if it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be here either.

505
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,796
Oh, I'm sorry to try and
show you guys some fun...

506
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,157
- While you're out here visiting me.
- Oh, yeah. Lot of fun.

507
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,374
Hey, Chris. All
right, you know what?

508
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,447
Relax.

509
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,511
- We're fine.
- We're fucking stranded out here.

510
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,342
And don't tell me to relax.

511
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,810
I swear to God...

512
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,478
This is the last time I listen to
one of your dumb fuckin' ideas.

513
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,181
Hey, you know what, Chris? Your fucking
whining isn't helping right now.

514
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,542
- He's got every right to be pissed.
- Okay, guys. Hey, Uri.

515
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,820
Someone has to know
we're out here, right?

516
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,994
I work alone.

517
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,234
Fucking great.

518
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,400
So, tell me, Uri.

519
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,169
What are our options right now?

520
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,867
We stay in van.

521
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,203
- Are we safe here?
- Yes, we're safe.

522
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,911
We close windows, lock doors.

523
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:33,006
In morning, I fix van, we drive up.
Or we all walk back to checkpoint.

524
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,144
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

525
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,912
Are you suggesting that
we spend the night here?

526
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:36,947
Okay, okay, guys

527
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,588
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have
to hike outta here, all right?

528
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,618
Uri, how far to the checkpoint?

529
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,255
- It's 20 kilometers.
- That's like 12, 13 miles.

530
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,757
Exactly. We can hike that.

531
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,034
No, no, not at night!

532
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,104
- It is not safe.
- Be quiet!

533
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,174
What the fuck was that?

534
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,254
- Are there people here?
- It's impossible.

535
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,625
It sounds like a baby.

536
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,258
- What is that?
- It's not a baby.

537
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,034
Then what the fuck is it, Uri?

538
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,033
Whoa, whoa. What's
with the gun, man?

539
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:32,269
- You have problem?
- Yeah. What's with the fucking gun?

540
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,648
You should all be
glad I have this.

541
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,713
Everyone stay here.

542
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,119
- A gun?
- Where is he going?

543
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,295
Do you trust him?

544
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,130
- Do you want to go out there with him?
- Easy, bro.

545
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,634
I don't know, it's
just that the...

546
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,324
Stay here. He'll come back.

547
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,993
- Chris, what the fuck...?
- Where's he going?

548
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,715
- Chris, I'm coming with you.
- No, I don't want you to come with me.

549
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,731
Just sit in the car and
think of another way...

550
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,302
You can fuck this
up even further.

551
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,507
I swear to God, Paul, it's a fucking
hazard having you as a brother.

552
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:08,808
Chris!

553
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,747
Chris!

554
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,611
- What's he gonna do?
- I don't know, babe.

555
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,785
- Where is he going?
- Uri, wait up!

556
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,596
I can't see him. Can
you guys see him?

557
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,540
Oh, God.

558
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,918
Chris!

559
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,648
- Chris! Chris!
- Chris! No!

560
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,123
Oh, my God, Chris, no!

561
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,197
Can you see anything?

562
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,767
- Can you see them?
- I don't know. I can't see.

563
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,200
Chris!

564
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,445
Michael, can you see?

565
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,031
Open the door!

566
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,376
Get him in, get him in!

567
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,984
Chris! Oh, my God, Chris!

568
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,317
Okay, look at me. Breathe, buddy.
Chris, mate, keep breathing.

569
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,114
Fuck!

570
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,050
- Chris! What happened?
- I don't fucking know!

571
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,658
- There were a lot of them!
- Where's Uri? Where's Uri?

572
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,161
Chris.

573
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,924
Chris, what happened to Uri?

574
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,060
They got him! They
fucking got him!

575
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,165
What the fuck got Uri?

576
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,363
Just breathe, baby!

577
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,208
- Hold him, hold him.
- Don't look!

578
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,448
- Where's your first aid Kit? He's cut.
- I don't know, check in here.

579
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,316
That's fucking fishing tackle!

580
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,022
Fuck!

581
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,958
Holy shit!

582
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,754
- What is that?
- Stay away from the windows!

583
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,230
Fuck off!

584
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,201
Hey, everyone away from
the fucking windows!

585
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,141
Stay away from the windows.

586
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,845
Chris. Chris, look at me, buddy.
Look at me, buddy.

587
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,772
It's gonna be all
right, brother.

588
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,753
Look at me, buddy. Stay
with me, all right?

589
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,450
- Get me the fuck outta here!
- I'm gonna get you home.

590
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,581
Chris, I'm gonna get you outta here.
Chris, look at me, look at me.

591
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,850
I'm gonna get you out. What
the fuck is with the lights?

592
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,798
Just relax. The battery's dying.
The fucking car battery is dying.

593
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,002
What the fuck is going on?

594
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,983
- Tie it tight.
- Can somebody please hold the light?

595
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,292
Good, good.

596
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,021
Fuck. Sorry, mate.

597
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,422
- Breathe, baby, just breathe.
- Breathe. Just breathe, mate.

598
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,502
Here, hold it up. Fuck. Here, mate.
Just breathe.

599
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,938
- I'm so sorry.
- Try not to look at it, mate.

600
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,007
Breathe, breathe.

601
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,368
I know, I know, I know!

602
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,637
It's gotta be tight,
I'm sorry, brother.

603
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,049
I'm so sorry, baby.

604
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,121
- What the fuck?
- Turn off the light, turn off the light!

605
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,520
Ah, fuck. Sorry, Chris.

606
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,060
Take it, take it.

607
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,426
Ah, fuck.

608
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,940
Here, Zoe. It'll be
all right, baby.

609
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,842
Just breathe, mate.
You're doing good.

610
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,636
- You're doing good.
- We're gonna get you out of this place.

611
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:34,980
I'm freezing.

612
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,692
- I know.
- Fuck!

613
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,425
You're gonna be okay.

614
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,229
It's okay, baby.

615
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,426
- How are you feeling?
- He needs a doctor.

616
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,134
I know he needs a doctor.

617
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,029
How are you doing?

618
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,805
I just want to get the
fuck out of here.

619
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:06,513
I can't fix it. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, the, the leads have rotted.

620
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:11,247
I mean, if we could get some new
leads, we could roll-start it, but...

621
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,555
I ain't fuckin' seen this before.
Try it.

622
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,620
Uri, this is Paul.
Can you hear me?

623
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,929
- That the other walkie?
- Yeah.

624
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,165
Uri, are you there?
Can you hear me?

625
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,099
Come on.

626
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,366
- All right, I'm gonna go look for him.
- You don't know your way around.

627
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,867
But he does. He can help
us get out of here.

628
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,438
And what if the dogs come back?

629
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,540
Uri said the dogs
come out at night.

630
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,540
So just stay in the van
and keep the door shut.

631
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,611
I'll go with you.

632
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,052
No, you will not.

633
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,546
Uri is a big fellow and it might
take two of us to carry him back.

634
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,958
Yeah, what if he's dead?

635
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,218
Don't say that. Uri knows how
to get the fuck outta here.

636
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,419
We might find new leads...

637
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,596
You saw what attacked the car. He says
that there's other things out here.

638
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,165
- Come on. Just stay here.
- Please!

639
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,901
- Please!
- Stay.

640
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,170
Yeah, I'm gonna come too. I'm
gonna help these guys, okay?

641
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,972
All right, let's go.

642
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,846
You stay in the car, you keep the door shut.
We'll be back for you.

643
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,816
You'll be all right, mate.
We'll be back.

644
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,878
- Stay with them. Help them.
- Michael, this is stupid.

645
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,155
- Why would you do that?
- I'll be back.

646
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,955
How well you know Uri?

647
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,799
Not well. You?

648
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,398
Same, same.

649
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,834
You think he's still here?

650
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,238
It's been overnight.
He could be gone.

651
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,777
Yeah, I know.

652
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,108
What are you thinking?

653
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,713
I think Chris got
attacked by dogs.

654
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,186
Dogs didn't do that.

655
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:00,650
Maybe a bear? I mean, we saw a bear
run by us at the apartment yesterday.

656
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,453
- He said there was something else.
- Yeah, and it could be a bear.

657
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,155
He said there was a lot of dogs.
It was dark, he was in shock.

658
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,692
Try the walkie-talkie, will you?

659
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,200
Hey, Uri, are you there?
It's Paul.

660
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,107
- Lets go around here.
- Uri, can you hear me?

661
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,739
Just stay close and keep
your eyes open, all right?

662
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,144
I don't believe him when he said that
animals don't come out during the day.

663
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,014
I don't know what to believe.

664
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,046
Fuck.

665
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,749
This is where he went
off last night, right?

666
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,356
Let's just try and figure out
how we get back to the van.

667
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:36,996
Good idea, mate.

668
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,591
Check your walkie-talkie again.

669
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,735
Hey, Uri, this is Paul.
Can you hear me, buddy?

670
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,142
- What?
- Do it again, do it again, do it again.

671
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,142
Uri, do you come...

672
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,041
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

673
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,778
Holy shit.

674
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,412
Something fucking got him.

675
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,922
Okay, let's go. We need to go.

676
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,687
No, we can't, mate.

677
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,391
We have to see if he's alive.

678
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,437
Uri?

679
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,089
Uri?

680
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,978
Uri?

681
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,014
It's okay.

682
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,979
There's too much blood.

683
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,324
- There's no way that he's still alive.
- I know, I know.

684
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,719
We need to be smart about this.
We're not going back there.

685
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,826
We are. I'm gonna go.
Besides, he's got the gun.

686
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,228
He's right.

687
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,136
Let's do it.

688
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,928
Uri?

689
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:46,811
Uri?

690
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,258
Uri!

691
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:52,485
Oh, fuck!

692
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,892
Holy shit!

693
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:56,964
Look!

694
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,624
Gotta check his pockets.

695
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,969
- Shit! Where's the gun?
- Oh, shit.

696
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,802
Wait. I've got the clip.

697
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,099
Lock the fucking door!

698
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,605
Oh, what the fuck is that?

699
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:25,173
- Holy shit!
- Gun, gun, gun!

700
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,040
- Fuck, there's no bullets!
- Right here!

701
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,449
All right, I got it! I'll do it!

702
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,611
Go!

703
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,754
Oh, shit!

704
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,350
Forget it!

705
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,187
Motherfucker!

706
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,968
Get the fuck outta. We're
getting the fuck outta here.

707
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,036
- What do you mean? Where we going?
- What's going on?

708
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,738
- We gotta go.
- Where's Uri? Did you find him?

709
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,673
- Yeah, what's left of him.
- What?

710
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,742
What he said, man. Uri's dead.

711
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,744
- We better go, we can't stay here.
- He cannot walk.

712
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,012
We can't stay here.

713
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,047
- I don't have a choice. Help me.
- He's right.

714
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,119
- What? Babe, no!
- Come on, I'll help you.

715
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,618
- Ah, fuck.
- Real slow.

716
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,921
- Just do it real slow.
- Easy, easy, easy.

717
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,026
All right.

718
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,834
- Aw, fuck.
- There you go. There you go.

719
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,363
- Fuck!
- Goddamn it, I told you, he can't walk!

720
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,901
- Put it back up, put it back up.
- Easy, easy.

721
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,067
- What's going on?
- All right, we gotta carry him.

722
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,136
- Don't be fucking stupid.
- We're not gonna leave you here!

723
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,947
It'll take three of you to
carry me and twice as long!

724
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,874
Fine. I'm staying here with him.

725
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,209
- I'm not leaving him!
- Well, I'm not leaving him either!

726
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,814
Would you listen to me?

727
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,756
You live here. You're the only
one that speaks the language.

728
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,890
Go get help and bring it back.

729
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,294
We're staying in the van.

730
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,768
All right.

731
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,795
- Take this.
- We'll be back. Come on, Zoe.

732
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,130
Stay on channel one.

733
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,066
If you guys need anything, if
anything happens, you call us.

734
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,969
It's 13 miles. We're gonna leave now.
If we hurry...

735
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,916
- We'll be back before it's dark.
- What if you're not back?

736
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,413
Take it.

737
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,112
- You know how to use that?
- Yeah, I think so.

738
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,017
All right, let's go.

739
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,953
- Paul, wait.
- We'll be back, mate.

740
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,414
Come on, let's go, Zoe.

741
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,416
- Look, I'm sorry...
- Stop. Stop.

742
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,828
I'm gonna get you home.

743
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,623
We'll be back
before you know it.

744
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,896
It's okay, babe. It's okay.

745
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,596
Way to go, Paul. Fucked
things up this time.

746
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,032
Okay, don't think like that. Come
on, that's not helping anyone.

747
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,934
I've been doing this his
whole fucking life.

748
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,915
I always get him into shit.
He always pays for it.

749
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:17,039
Well, despite all that,
you're his big brother.

750
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,146
So right now he's counting on you
to get him out of this. Okay?

751
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,985
Wait, wait!

752
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,091
Holy shit.

753
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,026
- Come on.
- We got to find a way around.

754
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,838
- Michael?
- Stay quiet.

755
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:40,635
- We'll loop around.
- Oh, God. Okay, go. Go, go-go.

756
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,708
Zoe, Zoe! Come on.

757
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,152
Shit. Guys.

758
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,791
The radiation's getting worse.

759
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:06,895
Let's go.

760
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,909
What is that? Look.

761
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,845
Holly shit.

762
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,918
- Will any of them start?
- No, babe, the batteries would be dead.

763
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,849
We might be able to find some cables, though.
Check the cars. Let's go!

764
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:37,988
Oh, fuck.

765
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,631
Wait! Wait!

766
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,002
Jesus! What the fuck?

767
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,395
- Who would shoot at a bus?
- I don't know, babe.

768
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,500
The guards?

769
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,342
These are exit holes.

770
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,410
Whatever was shooting was
shooting from the inside out.

771
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,711
- Can we just find these cables, please?
- Yeah.

772
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,715
Paul?

773
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,016
Paul?

774
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,018
Paul?

775
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,504
Amanda, there's
shells everywhere.

776
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,052
Maybe there's a gun in here.

777
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,016
Well, let's look.

778
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:59,068
Okay, wait, no. No. Come on, let's
get back to Michael and Zoe.

779
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,571
What if something's back there?

780
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,011
Goddamn it.

781
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,558
Nothing.

782
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:23,497
Oh, shit!

783
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,198
You okay?

784
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,105
Yeah.

785
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,139
Come on.

786
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,020
- Any bullets?
- No.

787
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,216
- It's broken, it won't fire.
- Look.

788
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,151
It works.

789
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,225
That's a piece of
a guard uniform.

790
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,092
Oh, let's get out of here.

791
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:53,333
Let's go.

792
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,765
What?

793
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,168
- Is it the same one?
- Oh, yeah!

794
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,542
- Will it work? Do you think it'll work?
- I think so.

795
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,806
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Call your bro.

796
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,054
Hey, Natalie? This is Paul.
Are you guys there?

797
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,617
Yeah, we're here.
Where are you guys?

798
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,354
You're not gonna believe this.
We got cables for the van.

799
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,152
When are you coming back?

800
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,690
Uh, we're heading back now.
Uh, how's my brother doing?

801
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,803
He's fine. Please hurry back.

802
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,300
'Cause we want to get
the fuck out of here.

803
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,773
Come on, come on!

804
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,836
Hey, Chris? You hang in there, buddy.
We're coming back for you right now!

805
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,111
We're on our way.

806
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,145
Come on, Zoe!

807
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:51,986
I can't run!

808
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:57,794
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Oh, my God!

809
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,032
This way. Here, here, here!

810
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,003
All right, come on, come on!

811
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,608
Come on!

812
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,003
You're good, babe.

813
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,044
You gotta go! You gotta go.

814
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,910
Keep moving, come on! Come on!

815
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:16,977
- You've gotta go!
- All right, all right.

816
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,413
Come on, come on.

817
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,047
Zoe, you've gotta
keep moving, babe!

818
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,846
- Zoe, it's okay.
- Come on, Zoe.

819
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:24,985
Yes!

820
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,422
- Come on, Zoe!
- You can do it, Zoe! Come on!

821
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:30,812
- Keep moving!
- Zoe, come on!

822
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,190
Oh, shit!

823
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,735
'Zoe! 'Zoe!

824
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,900
- Good. Here.
- Get back.

825
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:54,416
Michael!

826
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,183
Get him out!

827
00:56:58,548 --> 00:56:59,652
Get him up.

828
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,622
- Oh, my leg! My leg!
- Are you okay?

829
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,954
- It's just a scratch. It's okay.
- Get him up. Let's get him up.

830
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:06,990
Pull me up!

831
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,599
- Come on!
- We gotta move!

832
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,027
- Look at me! Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

833
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,829
Guys, come on. Let's get
the fuck out of here!

834
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,302
Damn it!

835
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,379
How's the leg?

836
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,981
Yeah, I'm all right, mate. I
just want to get us out of here.

837
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:34,316
Chris should be in
Moscow right now.

838
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,317
Exactly, but he's not.

839
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,299
So tell me what you know so we
can figure out what is going on.

840
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,823
Just urban legend, man.

841
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,565
They say this place
isn't really abandoned.

842
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:45,327
Well, obviously, the radiation
hasn't killed everything.

843
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,362
- I don't believe any of that shit.
- Why not can't you believe it?

844
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,497
There's so much that's
been going on...

845
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,418
There's people gotta be
out here doing this shit.

846
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,814
- Think about it!
- There has to be something. He's right.

847
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,803
- I mean, think about it.
- Chris.

848
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,910
Uri. That thing in the kitchen.
What was that?

849
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,609
And I swear there was something
in a photo I took the other day.

850
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,411
I didn't think anything
of it at the time, but...

851
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,646
- See? The photo.
- It was a shadow...

852
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,491
It didn't make sense at the time,
nothing had happened then.

853
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,994
Listen. Listen, okay?

854
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:19,964
- Zoe, come on.
- Come on, let's go!

855
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,735
What? This is where we were.

856
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,171
- Did they get it started?
- And they wouldn't call us?

857
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,584
- Natalie?
- Wait, look! Over here.

858
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,845
What? Is that from the van?

859
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,913
Oh, my God.

860
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,484
What the fuck?

861
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,455
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

862
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,628
Chris!

863
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,027
Chris!

864
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:57,937
Fuck!

865
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,410
- Chris!
- Whoa! Keep it down, mate.

866
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,750
Hey, come here!

867
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,118
- Chris!
- Hey, guys! It's recording.

868
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,519
What, what?

869
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,151
I don't know. It's Chris.

870
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,997
- What are you talking about?
- Just listen.

871
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,994
- I love you, Natalie.
- I love you, too, baby.

872
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:27,997
- I love you so much.
- I know.

873
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,606
I just need you to know that.

874
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,403
I was gonna wait
'til Moscow, but...

875
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,071
No, babe, wait till Moscow.

876
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,105
We're gonna be there tomorrow...

877
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:38,881
And then you can do
everything as planned, okay?

878
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:39,977
I know, but I just...

879
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,919
What was that?

880
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,288
Babe, grab the camera.
Shine it over here.

881
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,494
- Is that them?
- I don't know.

882
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,888
- Can you see anything?
- I don't see anybody.

883
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,795
- Is it Paul?
- I don't know.

884
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,565
- What the fuck is happening? No...
- Keep it down.

885
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,200
- Chris!
- Keep your shit together!

886
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,544
Stay the fuck away from me!

887
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:42,012
Shit! Just keep it down.

888
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,982
- I'm not leaving my brother!
- He's not here.

889
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,017
- Chris!
- What was that?

890
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,078
- Chris? Chris? Chris!
- Please, be quiet.

891
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,080
Shit!

892
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:52,749
Chris!

893
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:56,118
We can't leave them. We can't leave them.
We need to find them.

894
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,326
We need to find them!
Please! Let's go!

895
01:00:58,554 --> 01:00:59,788
Please, Michael, we
need to find them.

896
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,632
- Fucking hell!
- Please!

897
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,377
There, through there.

898
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:24,683
Careful.

899
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,895
Oh, Chris!

900
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,635
Oh, Chris!

901
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,175
Natalie?

902
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:12,834
Is that Chris?

903
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,308
Chris?

904
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:31,887
Chris?

905
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,693
Come on, Zoe.

906
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,835
Baby, we have to, he's got the gun.
Come on.

907
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,711
Chris?

908
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:02,979
Nat?

909
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,217
Chris?

910
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,822
- He's not here.
- I heard him. I heard him.

911
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,599
- Paul! We've got to go!
- We can't stay here. Let's go.

912
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,026
Come on, please? Please,
mate, we'll find him.

913
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:19,404
I'm sorry. Come on.

914
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:22,768
Ri-in!

915
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:35,017
Natalie!

916
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,758
Come on. Come on, nat, come on!

917
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:42,984
Oh, Jesus!

918
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,362
Come on! This way, this way!

919
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,726
I got her! I got her! Okay,
you're okay, baby. You're okay.

920
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:48,959
Michael?

921
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,635
I got you. It's okay, it's okay.

922
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,239
It's a fucking map. Look!

923
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,236
Natalie, where's Chris?

924
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,004
Natalie, where's Chris?

925
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:00,836
Paul!

926
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,170
What happened to my brother?

927
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,939
While we're going this
way, he's in there!

928
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,010
Hey, leave her alone!

929
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,509
Shit.

930
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,221
Natalie, where's Chris?

931
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,848
The people... they got him.

932
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,556
That's the road we came in on.

933
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,752
So then we came onto the checkpoint,
and that's another checkpoint.

934
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:20,188
And we're here. Hey, there's
another checkpoint!

935
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:23,625
It's close. We can get there. We'll
find help and come back. I promise.

936
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,427
- I can't leave yet.
- I understand, but we got to go.

937
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,995
I'm not leaving
without my brother!

938
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,331
We need to! We don't even
know if Chris is still...

939
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,000
Don't you fucking say that!
Don't you fucking say that!

940
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:37,001
Give me the gun! Back off! Back off!
I'm sorry, mate. We want to help you.

941
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,983
We'll find your brother, I promise,
but we gotta go. We need help.

942
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,611
- Please? Please?
- Paul, Paul?

943
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,246
No, Paul!

944
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,549
We're gonna find Chris but we are
no good to him if we're dead, okay?

945
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,258
Listen to me! Listen
to me, Paul, okay?

946
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,621
We're gonna go find help, and
then we're gonna come back...

947
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,356
And we're gonna get
your brother, okay?

948
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,157
Fuck. We need to get out of here.
Show me the map again.

949
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,229
Right now, I need you
to get it together.

950
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,803
For everyone else's
sake and mine.

951
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,100
All right?

952
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,211
Come on!

953
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:10,840
Come on!

954
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,082
That doesn't make sense.

955
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,988
The radiation's getting worse.

956
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:28,196
We've got to keep going. Come on.
We've got to keep going, come on!

957
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,557
Zoe, come on.

958
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,660
- Here, Michael, it doesn't make sense.
- What do you mean?

959
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,028
Because the map says that...

960
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,737
- Zoe, come on. We gotta go that way.
- ...we're supposed to be here. No, but look.

961
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,968
It says that this way
is supposed to be...

962
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,612
Michael, look at it, it stops!

963
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,339
- Then we have to go back.
- Which way do we have to go?

964
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:48,043
- If we go back here...
- I know it's not. Zoe, Zoe, please?

965
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,149
- Michael, no, we have to go!
- Guys, guys!

966
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,186
What the fuck?

967
01:05:58,387 --> 01:05:59,695
Wait!

968
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,500
Hello?

969
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,008
What are you saying?

970
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,532
Natalie!

971
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:38,762
Oh, my God!

972
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,365
No!

973
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,306
- Where is she?
- She's gone!

974
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,310
Natalie!

975
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,246
Listen, listen, listen!

976
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,155
This way, this way!

977
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:00,091
Zoe, stay in front of me.

978
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:11,295
Holy shit! That's a guard!

979
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,433
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go!

980
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,305
Natalie?

981
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,619
Natalie?

982
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:29,844
- Shit!
- We've got to go.

983
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:30,949
Nat!

984
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,926
- Where is she?
- I don't know, I don't know!

985
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,061
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

986
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,029
Move, move, move! Come on!

987
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,566
Michael! Michael!

988
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,205
- Fuck, there's too many!
- Come on!

989
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,220
Keep going, keep going.

990
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,718
Here, there.

991
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,696
Hurry the fuck up!

992
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,498
Come on.

993
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,175
Come on!

994
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,752
Boxes! Shut the fucking door!

995
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,347
Push! Push!

996
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,778
- Come on, come on.
- Ah, they're coming!

997
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,336
- Kick it!
- There's another room back here!

998
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,331
Michael, come on!

999
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,362
Zoe, just get going! Go, go!

1000
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:55,205
Michael!

1001
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,432
- Go, get in, get in.
- Michael!

1002
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,879
Zoe, get inside!

1003
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,408
Zoe, get inside!

1004
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,344
- Come on! Close the door.
- Michael!

1005
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,677
- Push it! Push it!
- It's stuck!

1006
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:11,157
Michael, get in! Get in!

1007
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,353
Michael!

1008
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,790
He's trapped in there!
He can't get out!

1009
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,858
No, we have to go.

1010
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,099
Go!

1011
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,114
Go!

1012
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,533
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.

1013
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:39,567
It's okay. It's okay.

1014
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,549
- No, no, no, no, Zoe!
- Get up, Zoe, come on.

1015
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,610
I got you, I got you. Come on.

1016
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:48,988
What is this place?

1017
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,146
Shit.

1018
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,735
Not down. Not down.

1019
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:41,503
Fuck!

1020
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,744
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1021
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:46,675
Fuck!

1022
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,213
Oh, fuck. Put the light on!

1023
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,009
Zoe.

1024
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:55,253
Put the fucking lighten!

1025
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,312
Put the fucking light on!

1026
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,947
This must be where
they were living.

1027
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,978
Keep moving. Come
on, keep moving.

1028
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:29,955
Chris? Chris?

1029
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,185
Chris?

1030
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:44,295
Chris?

1031
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,374
Go, go, go!

1032
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,510
Which way?

1033
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:00,175
Come on, I'll help you.

1034
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:03,587
- Paul, go!
- Give me your hand. Come on.

1035
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,588
- Oh, my God! They're coming!
- Give me your hand!

1036
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:09,984
Come on, come on!

1037
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,931
No! "Go!"

1038
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,570
Don't let go, Zoe!

1039
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,775
No!

1040
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,343
No! No!

1041
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,972
Up here, up here.

1042
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,746
Come on, come on, come on!

1043
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,111
Paul?

1044
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,619
I let them all go.

1045
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,286
It's my fault.

1046
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,959
Come on, come on. We
can still find them.

1047
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,999
We can still find them.

1048
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,593
Come on, let's just go. We can
still find them. Come on.

1049
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,972
Please? Just take my hand.
Come on.

1050
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:31,105
We gotta get outta here.

1051
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,122
There's something
wrong with my eyes.

1052
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,085
Oh, fuck.

1053
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,756
Hey, my face is burning.

1054
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:51,895
Fuck, you look all blurry.

1055
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,494
What is that?

1056
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,601
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1057
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:00,695
Come on! Come on! Please, hurry!

1058
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:03,836
- Fuck! Everything's blurry.
- I know. Okay, I got you.

1059
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,970
We gotta find a way out of here
before the radiation kills us.

1060
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,014
- Are you okay?
- -Yeah, go. I'm fine.

1061
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,386
Careful. Okay.

1062
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:23,624
Oh, no.

1063
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,566
I'm so sorry, Amanda.

1064
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:38,169
No.

1065
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,020
Amanda, we can't stay here.

1066
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,790
We can't stay here.
We have to go.

1067
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:57,622
And I can't leave without you.
So please, let's just go.

1068
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,580
- Wait.
- A way out.

1069
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,188
Oh, fuck.

1070
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:25,686
Holy shit.

1071
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:40,434
No!

1072
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,748
Run! Run!

1073
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,636
I can't see anything.

1074
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:29,651
I can't see... Help!

1075
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,615
- Help!
- Help!

1076
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,185
Help!

1077
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,695
- We need help!
- Help!

1078
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,189
Please!

1079
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:44,704
Stop! Don't come any closer!

1080
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,295
Help us, please!

1081
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:49,196
Stop!

1082
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,404
- Please, help us!
- Please, stop!

1083
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,513
- No!
- Please!

1084
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:34,875
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?
What is your name?

1085
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,583
Where are you taking me?

1086
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:37,878
Ow, my face!

1087
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,189
It's okay. How did you
get into Pripyat?

1088
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:43,117
There were people.
They were chasing us.

1089
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:46,987
Yes, patients, victim of radiation.
They escaped.

1090
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,522
You saw them, yes?

1091
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,298
They killed my friends.

1092
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,536
- Anyone else know you're here?
- No.

1093
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,236
Where are you taking me?

1094
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,710
What is this place?

1095
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:08,144
We're in the hospital. We're
taking you to doctor.

1096
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:11,290
What is the status of the
patients that escaped?

1097
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:13,492
We got them all.

1098
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,716
And the Americans?

1099
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:18,018
All dead, except for this one.

1100
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:21,000
- Where did you find her?
- Outside the reactor.

1101
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,135
We can't let her go.

1102
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,094
She's seen them.

1103
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,561
My skin is burning.

1104
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:29,439
You were inside reactor.

1105
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,011
It's extremely dangerous.

1106
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,372
Okay...

1107
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,008
We will help.

1108
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,999
- No, no, no!
- Go! Go!

1109
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,500
Who's there?
