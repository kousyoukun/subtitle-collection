1
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,872
Good morning, Mr. Basset.
This is your wake-up call.

2
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,118
Please move your ass.

3
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,469
Stampede!

4
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,874
Stampede, Earl! Get out of the way!

5
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,238
You dumb shit.

6
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,158
I was in a stampede once.

7
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,318
300 head going hell-bent for the horizon.

8
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,595
Exactly how many cows
are required for a stampede, Earl?

9
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,918
I mean, is it like three or more?
Is there a minimum speed?

10
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,311
I wish a stampede up your ass.

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,749
No breakfast?

12
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,079
I did it yesterday.
It was bologna and beans.

13
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,438
No. It was eggs. I did eggs...

14
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,949
...over easy.

15
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,715
The hell you did.
Bologna and beans. It's your turn.

16
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,552
I guess when I'm your age...

17
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,518
...I'll forget what I eat, too.

18
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,193
Goddamn it!

19
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,720
I ask you, is this a job for intelligent men?

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,472
Show me one. I'll ask him.

21
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,598
If we were serious about money,
we'd quit being hired hands.

22
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,797
Handymen, Earl. We are handymen.

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,031
We should quit this job...

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,270
...and find ourselves
some real employment.

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
Are you going to give up
all this personal freedom?

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,194
I don't know.

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,789
Freeway!

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,472
What's on the agenda for today?

29
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,791
- It's garbage day.
- Man! Already?

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,998
What's Nestor paying us?

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,037
$50. And that's $47 more than we got.

32
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,917
Burt and Heather's place is closer.
Let's do their linoleum today...

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,513
...and the garbage tomorrow.

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,637
Nestor's not home tomorrow.
We don't dig today, we're not paid.

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,990
Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.

36
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,709
You never take the long view.
Here it is Monday...

37
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,950
...and I'm already thinking of Wednesday.

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,234
It is Monday, right?

39
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,679
Who the hell's that?
That's not the grad student?

40
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,797
- No. He graduated. Must be the new one.
- The new one?

41
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,192
That's supposed to be a girl.

42
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,354
You will have long, blonde hair...

43
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,233
...big green eyes, world-class breasts...

44
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,758
...ass that won't quit
and legs that go all the way up!

45
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,997
Hi! I'm Rhonda LeBeck.
I'm up here for the semester.

46
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,430
- Yeah, geography.
- Geology.

47
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,872
Well, actually seismology. Earthquakes.

48
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,078
You two must be Val and Earl.

49
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,834
- I've heard all about you.
- We deny everything.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,638
I've got a question for you.

51
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,632
Do you know if anybody's
doing any drilling or blasting...

52
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,312
...or anything like that?

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,834
Around here? No, ma'am.

54
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,719
I'm supposed to monitor the seismographs.

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,710
You know, they measure vibrations.

56
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,798
Vibrations in the ground.

57
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,110
Yeah.

58
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,079
I've been getting
some really strange readings.

59
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,113
The school's had the machines here, and
we've never recorded anything like this.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,590
We'll ask around.
See if anyone's heard anything.

61
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,595
Thanks.

62
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,555
God, I hope they're not broken.
I might have to bag the whole semester.

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,316
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,915
No problem.

65
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,874
Nice meeting you.
Hope you get it all sorted out.

66
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,793
If you wanted,
we could take a look at those...

67
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,117
...seismographs for her if you want.

68
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,509
What the hell do we know
about seismographs?

69
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,749
Nothing.

70
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,760
- It might be a slick way to get to know her.
- Why?

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,233
Damn it, Valentine.

72
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,955
You don't go for any gal
unless she fits your list, top to bottom.

73
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,429
- Well sure!
- It's dumber than my hind end.

74
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,919
I mean, like that...

75
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,192
...Bobby Lynn Dexter.

76
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,919
Tammy Lynn Baxter.

77
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,994
It don't matter.
They're all the same: Dead weight.

78
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,158
"Oh, I broke a nail!"

79
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,839
Makes my skin crawl.

80
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,674
I'm a victim of circumstance.

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,158
I thought you call it your pecker.

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,554
Pizza-face!

83
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,435
Melvin.

84
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,279
You touch that truck and die.

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,751
Man, I'm really shaking.

86
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,549
Thanks, Walter.

87
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,752
These are hollow points,
but not hydro-shock hollow points.

88
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,559
- Bullets are bullets.
- Hi, guys. What's happening?

89
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,154
We ran into that new college student,
that Rona.

90
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,631
Rhonda. She's having trouble with her...

91
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,270
...things.

92
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,952
Those college kids turn up
oil or uranium or something out there...

93
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,832
...next thing the Feds will be at our door.
"Sorry. Time to move. Eminent domain."

94
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,359
Down, honey. Down.

95
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,510
Yeah, Burt. The way you worry...

96
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,354
...you'll get a heart attack before
you get a chance to survive World War III.

97
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,555
We'll see.

98
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,396
Guys, listen. Bearing going out.
What do you think?

99
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,718
- Could be.
- Later, Chang. We got a schedule to keep.

100
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,918
Yeah. See, we plan ahead.
That way we don't do anything right now.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,149
Earl explained it to me.

102
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,389
Cocktail?

103
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,229
You bet.

104
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,109
I'll tell you.

105
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,796
Nobody handles garbage
better than we do.

106
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,917
Come on, Earl. This is low.

107
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,193
We have got to set our sights
a little bit higher.

108
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,034
Melvin, why don't you give us a hand?
Most of this shit is yours anyway.

109
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,509
Listen, run to the store
and pick me up a six-pack. I'll pay for it.

110
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,915
Son, beer is for adults.

111
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,158
Not having a plan
is what keeps us doing jobs like this.

112
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,272
Just doing jobs like this
is you dragging your feet.

113
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,838
Are you going to stand there and tell me
I'm the reason we're still in Perfection?

114
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,559
You know how close I am
to leaving this place right now?

115
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,108
I'll call that little bluff. How close?

116
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,990
- Shit!
- Goddamn!

117
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,589
Jesus Christ! Goddamn!

118
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,513
Don't forget the TV.

119
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,792
- Why you bringing the vacuum cleaner?
- I like it.

120
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,394
- You never use it.
- It's good for parts.

121
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,832
Besides, maybe we'll hire a maid.
You think about that?

122
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,273
Get in the truck.

123
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,989
Guys!

124
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,038
Guys, wait!

125
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,273
Sorry, Nancy.
We're not delivering firewood anymore.

126
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,028
- We're heading for Bixby permanent.
- Sure.

127
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,197
Oh, my God. You really are!

128
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,194
Mindy, what's the count?

129
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,952
640.

130
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,116
I don't need firewood. I have this big order
to fill and have to build my pottery kiln.

131
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,995
Come on, it'll be at least a month's work.

132
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,479
I'll throw in lunches.

133
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,914
And beer.

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,389
I can't believe we said no to free beer.

135
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,796
We did it! We faced temptation
and did not bend!

136
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,598
Goddamn! Praise the Lord!

137
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,229
Now there's nothing, and I mean nothing,
between us and Bixby.

138
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,194
Look at that guy!

139
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,232
That's one job I'd never do.
Working around electricity.

140
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,238
Hold up.

141
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,113
That's Edgar Deems.

142
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,870
Come on.

143
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,515
He only wears that one damn jacket.

144
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,671
That's him, I'm telling you.

145
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,155
He sure must've been drunk this time.

146
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,436
Get your butt down from there!

147
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,832
Shit.

148
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,071
We can't leave him up there.

149
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,753
Thank you, Edgar.

150
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,598
You owe me on this one,
you damned old boozehound.

151
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,309
One of these days, you'll have
to get your ass on a wagon and stay there.

152
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,796
It's not like I don't have
better things to do than climb towers...

153
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,389
...and drag your hairy ass down.

154
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,509
Jesus!

155
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,478
Was it a heart attack, doctor?

156
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,430
No.

157
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,949
He died of dehydration. Thirst.

158
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,956
That doesn't make any sense.
That takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

159
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,553
Maybe even three or four.

160
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,356
You mean he sat up there
three or four days?

161
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,670
He sat up there and just died of thirst?

162
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,554
You reckon he hated Perfection
more than us?

163
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,674
- Do you suppose he wanted to kill himself?
- Somebody must've chased him up there.

164
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,112
You mean someone that ain't scared
of a Winchester rifle?

165
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,153
Then what'd they do?
Camp out and wait for him to die?

166
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,474
What the hell?

167
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,436
What the shit?

168
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,714
Fred!

169
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,999
- This is weird.
- This is real weird.

170
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,270
- Jesus!
- What the hell's going on?

171
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,030
I mean, what the hell is going on?

172
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,119
Get the hell out of here!
There's a killer on the loose!

173
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,875
- What?
- A murderer, man! A real psycho!

174
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,720
He's cutting people's heads off.
I'm not kidding!

175
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,757
They're pulling our chain.

176
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,756
Yeah.

177
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,435
What?

178
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,915
Howard!

179
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,269
Carmine?

180
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,479
Who could be doing it?

181
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,599
I'm not accusing anybody,
but some of my cattle are missing.

182
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,830
Are you serious? Old Fred's dead?

183
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,394
- You're bullshitting me.
- What happened to Fred?

184
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,629
Worse than Edgar.

185
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,870
- What happened to him?
- You won't believe it.

186
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,316
- I need a candy bar.
- I don't believe this. The phone's dead.

187
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,755
- Walter, your phone is dead!
- I didn't do it.

188
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,512
Nestor, what's happening?

189
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,957
- Somebody killed old Fred.
- What's going on?

190
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,154
Val, you've got to get to Bixby,
and get the police up here. And step on it.

191
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,678
Consider it stepped on.

192
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,079
We decided to leave this place
one damn day too late, you know?

193
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,553
There's sure as hell
nothing to stop us now.

194
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,153
Everybody we know between here
and Bixby is already dead.

195
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,514
Look out!

196
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,030
Is there some higher force at work here?

197
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,116
I mean, are we asking too much of life?

198
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,151
Where the hell are these guys?

199
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,911
What are they doing? Blasting?

200
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,670
Where are you guys?
It's not like there's another road, assholes!

201
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,794
- Jesus! I don't believe this!
- You're hung up.

202
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,515
I am not!

203
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,472
You're hung up, I tell you!

204
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,037
You're going to burn the clutch!

205
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,116
- You could break an axle like that.
- Could you shut up?

206
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,190
I don't need to spend the night out here.

207
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,309
Crybaby.

208
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,839
- Could it have been coyotes?
- No way.

209
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,672
Coyotes didn't kill Fred.

210
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,950
It's Val and Earl.

211
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,072
They shouldn't be here already.

212
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,311
- Thought you two were in Bixby by now.
- You're won't believe this.

213
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,516
- Mom!
- Oh, my God!

214
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,510
- Burt, be careful.
- Unreal.

215
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,953
- Where'd you get it?
- I didn't know we had it.

216
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,390
- It's disgusting.
- Some kind of snake?

217
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,718
- It's more like an eel to me.
- Eels live in the water, don't they?

218
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,828
- Big mother slug, maybe.
- Don't touch!

219
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,389
Relax. It's dead.

220
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,039
It must've grabbed us!

221
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,793
- That's why the truck stalled.
- I said I wasn't hung up.

222
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,472
This stalled out your truck?

223
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,270
It'd have to be one strong son of a bitch.

224
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,595
Stinks, too.

225
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,476
I'll give you boys $5 for this.

226
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,595
$20.

227
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,956
- Okay, $10!
- $15.

228
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,473
- Okay, $15.
- Damn right, $15.

229
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,313
I don't believe you guys.

230
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,273
Could be a snake!

231
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,358
Some kind of mutation.

232
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,753
Whatever it is...

233
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,870
...just one of these couldn't eat up Fred
and his whole flock of sheep.

234
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,310
You think there are more out there?

235
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,197
I'm dead.
Let's put this stuff up in the morning.

236
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,435
We have to go to Bixby in the morning.

237
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,352
- The cinder blocks are in.
- The cinder blocks. Oh, my God!

238
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,598
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.

239
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,190
That's the sky that'll be
over our roof every night when we're done.

240
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,149
What if we don't finish the roof?
Then we can look at the sky all the time.

241
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,517
That damn thing.

242
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,394
Maybe it's time we buy a new generator.

243
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,349
It's gone!

244
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,391
What do you mean, it's gone?

245
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,792
You sure this is where it was?

246
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,436
It was right here! There's the cord.
Hold this.

247
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,717
Maybe the ground caved in.
There's mines and stuff around here.

248
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,037
Well, don't then. You don't want to fall in.

249
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,675
Let's go.

250
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,112
God, what is that stink?

251
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,269
You hear that?

252
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,796
Come on. Let's just go.

253
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,915
Let's go back to town or something.
Please, Jim!

254
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,271
Maybe it's a geological thing
like natural gas...

255
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,115
...or a geyser. They stink like that.
Remember in Yellowstone?

256
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,313
Something's got me!

257
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,871
Something's got me down here!

258
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,914
Get something. Get me out of here!

259
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,673
Something's got me. Please get me out!

260
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,353
Help me!

261
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,634
Oh, my God.

262
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,072
- Don't look so afraid. It won't hurt you.
- Mindy look up. Smile.

263
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,434
Hold it.

264
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,390
Melvin, get out of there!

265
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,756
- Old Chang, slick as snot, and I ain't lying.
- A lousy $15.

266
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,552
A man who plans ahead.

267
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,114
We arm ourselves,
we set perimeters, we stand guard.

268
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,917
Any of those snake things show up here,
we make 'em extinct.

269
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,629
- All right!
- Burt, get serious.

270
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,871
Yeah! You make it sound like a war.

271
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,476
What've you got against being prepared?

272
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,436
Rambo.

273
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,918
Walter's got a CB radio.
Why aren't you calling Bixby? The police...

274
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,078
We can't reach outside the valley
because of the mountains.

275
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,709
You're next. Sit down, look scared.

276
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,351
The phone's out. The road's out.
We're on our own.

277
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,870
You two are just loving it, aren't you?

278
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,077
Nancy, don't get personal about this!
We've got to do something.

279
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,275
Hell, yes!

280
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,912
We are completely cut off.

281
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,510
We got the cliffs to the north,
mountains to the east and the west.

282
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,396
That's why Heather and me settled here.
Geographic isolation.

283
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,879
- There's got to be a way we can get help.
- This isn't the moon!

284
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,794
What are you going to do,
walk the 38 miles to Bixby?

285
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,959
There's Walter's saddle horses.

286
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,435
That's it. You're welcome to them.

287
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,237
Somebody could ride to Bixby.

288
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,396
That's not bad.

289
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,478
Who's best on a horse?

290
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,631
They better be fast.

291
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,029
We don't want to be stuck
on a couple of canners.

292
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,599
- Those snakes couldn't travel that fast.
- For all you know they could fly.

293
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,231
What do you want?
This Colt or Edgar's old rifle?

294
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,196
Rifle.

295
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,990
- Here's some Swiss cheese and bullets.
- Thanks.

296
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,348
- You guys all set?
- Ready as we'll ever be.

297
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,193
We're going to find that college girl,
tell her to get her ass back into town.

298
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,393
Good idea. We'll stop by the doctor's place
and see if they went into Bixby.

299
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,708
Wait a minute, guys.

300
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,758
Take something that packs
more of a punch than that.30-.30.

301
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,315
Why don't you take
one of our Browning autos?

302
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,875
Or better than that. Take my Model 70?

303
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,275
It's.375 "H and H" mag.

304
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,199
Thanks, Heather.

305
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,751
I hope we don't need to use it.

306
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,309
It's got me!

307
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,234
It's got me!

308
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,998
- Grow up!
- Damn it!

309
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,389
- He's only kidding.
- You came that close.

310
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,636
Too close. No more games.

311
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,000
One of these days
somebody's going to kick your ass.

312
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,835
Doctor?

313
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,791
I hate this shit.

314
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,754
Wait a minute.

315
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,919
The car's gone.
We just missed 'em, that's all.

316
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,754
Where's the goddamn golden oldie
coming from?

317
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,836
- What the hell's this?
- You got me.

318
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,436
Here's the plan. We don't even stop.
We ride like hell.

319
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,798
Tonight we'll keep right on going.
We'll walk the horses.

320
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,431
That is the plan.
What the hell are those things?

321
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,717
- How could they bury a station wagon?
- Why would they do it?

322
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,473
Come on, git!

323
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,391
Walter wouldn't know
a decent horse if it bit him in the ass.

324
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,718
Wait a minute.
They got wind of something they don't like.

325
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,839
Something's going on.

326
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,911
I don't see anything anywhere!

327
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,430
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. What about my horse?

328
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,233
What in the name of...

329
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,276
That's how they get you.
They're under the goddamn ground.

330
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,992
- What the hell are they?
- Sons of bitches!

331
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,993
Must be a million of 'em!

332
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,278
Nope. Just one.

333
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,314
Come on.

334
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,279
He's gaining on us!

335
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,555
Look!

336
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,591
We can make it!

337
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,793
Stupid son of a bitch.

338
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,432
It knocked itself cold.

339
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,914
Cold, my ass!

340
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,075
He's dead.

341
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,635
We killed it.

342
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,994
We killed it!

343
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,037
Fuck you!

344
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,677
Hey, guys. What's going on?

345
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,995
Did you notice anything weird
a minute ago?

346
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,633
I mean, it just happened...

347
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,509
What's that?

348
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,797
All right, together. One, two, three.

349
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,113
Jesus Christ!

350
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,355
Does it smell like that 'cause it's dead?

351
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,473
I don't see any eyes.

352
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,117
Must be totally subterranean.

353
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,468
And those tentacles.

354
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,036
You know, I think
they shoot right out of its mouth...

355
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,878
...and they hook you and pull you right in.

356
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,114
Good thing we stopped it
before it killed anybody else.

357
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,350
This is important, you know.

358
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,188
This is like...

359
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,873
...well, let's just say it.

360
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,236
This is probably the biggest
zoological discovery of the century.

361
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,439
Check this out.

362
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,998
I found the ass end.

363
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,789
Jesus, we really caught something here.

364
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,074
- Wow!
- Man!

365
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,638
That's one big mother.

366
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,718
This must be the old boy
had your seismos working overtime.

367
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,630
It must push itself along with these.

368
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,831
All of them pushing at once.

369
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,271
That's why it moved so fast.

370
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,713
This thing had sensors tripping
all over the place. No...

371
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,189
Rhonda, you ever heard
of anything like this?

372
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,158
Everybody knows about 'em.
We just didn't tell you.

373
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,274
Hell, man,
no one ever saw anything like this!

374
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,078
We're really onto something.

375
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,075
I'll tell you, old Chang don't get
his slick mitts on this for no measly $15.

376
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,839
You got that right.

377
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,588
All right, here's the plan.
We need a flatbed...

378
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,989
- Right, with a winch.
- A five-ton maybe.

379
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,400
No, don't want a winch. It'd tear it all up.

380
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,948
- A crane?
- Yeah, a crane with lifting straps.

381
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,155
Shut up.

382
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,113
- There are three more of these things.
- What?

383
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,756
Three more?

384
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,877
I've got seismographs all over the valley.
Compare the readings.

385
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,632
Here's one at 2:00 yesterday.

386
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,952
But here's one three miles away
at the exact time. That's two.

387
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,917
- But here...
- We'll take your word.

388
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,639
- Yeah, where's your truck?
- Just beyond that hill.

389
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,829
What?

390
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,713
- Damn prairie dog burrow.
- Little sons of bitches.

391
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,195
This way!

392
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,599
Up on that rock!

393
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,477
Looks like the one that got our truck.

394
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,279
- Where the hell's your truck?
- Right over there.

395
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,870
I don't think we can make that.

396
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,554
At least he can't climb.

397
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,036
Live ones smell worse than the dead ones.

398
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,233
I got it.

399
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,795
They're mutations caused by radiation.

400
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,389
Or no.

401
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,077
The government built 'em.
Big surprise for the Russians.

402
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,717
There's nothing like them
in the fossil record. I'm sure.

403
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,515
Okay, so, they predate the fossil record.

404
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,559
That would make 'em
a couple billion years old.

405
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,149
And we've just never seen one 'til now.

406
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,750
Right.

407
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,316
I vote for outer space.
No way these are local boys.

408
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,598
Well, haven't seen a sign for hours.

409
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,239
Must be long gone.

410
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,714
Yeah, must be.

411
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,674
Why don't you take
a little stroll and find out?

412
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,919
We've got to do something.

413
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,998
"We've got to do something."

414
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,516
I don't know why "we"
always has to be "me" every damn time.

415
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,159
We, we, we. What do I look like?
An expert on worms?

416
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,549
Watch it, it's got a good six-foot reach.

417
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,959
Thank you, Earl.

418
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,393
Son of a bitch!

419
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,030
Son of a goddamn bitch!
Pardon my French.

420
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,313
Shit! It's been waiting here all this time?
How's it know we're still here?

421
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,075
It's got no eyes, right?
Sure as hell can't smell us underground.

422
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,309
It's been listening.

423
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,389
Of course!

424
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,275
It senses seismic vibration.

425
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,393
It can hear every move we make
on this rock. It's a perfect conductor!

426
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,228
That means we're stuck.
That pisses me off!

427
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,269
I hate to be crude,
but I've got to take care of business.

428
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,956
- Me, too.
- Same here.

429
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,835
Thanks.

430
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,591
No problem. Anytime.

431
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,758
Well, what's the plan?

432
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,433
The first thing we've got to do
is see if old Stumpy's still out there.

433
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,071
- Can I borrow that shovel?
- Yeah.

434
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,071
Doesn't he have a home to go to?

435
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,800
That's why Edgar never got down
off that damn tower.

436
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,029
I have an idea.

437
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,511
You know, we have to come up with a plan
or he's going to wait us to death.

438
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,758
- I was thinking...
- Why not run? We outran him yesterday.

439
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,753
Run for it? Running's not a plan.
Running's what you do when a plan fails.

440
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,796
You're not trying to think of a plan.

441
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,235
It ain't like we got a hell of a lot of options.

442
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,312
There's always options.
We've just got to think of them.

443
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,072
Why don't you start thinking?

444
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,510
Why do I always
have to do all the thinking?

445
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,956
- Who died and made you Einstein?
- You know how to pole vault?

446
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,198
We just stay where he can't get us...

447
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,230
...on these residual boulders.
My truck's parked next to one.

448
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,238
Stay on those residual boulders!

449
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,429
That Tammy Lynn Baxter,
she do much pole vaulting?

450
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,993
That's pretty good.

451
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,238
That slimebag won't give us much time
once we hit that truck.

452
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,636
- I say we all jump together.
- Right.

453
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,189
Wait.

454
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,279
Okay, ready.

455
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,553
One, two, three!

456
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,879
Go!

457
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,789
Watch it, Val!

458
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,919
Move!

459
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,478
Can somebody, perhaps, help me?

460
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,594
No!

461
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,389
The snake things are just their tongues.
These animals are huge!

462
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,432
I'm sorry.
I'm having a real difficult time with this.

463
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,512
Come on, you guys, answer.

464
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,320
- Where's Burt and Heather?
- I can't reach them.

465
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,476
I guess they're still driving around.

466
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,154
What's the name you call those things?

467
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,952
Where do they come from?

468
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,394
- I don't know.
- You're a scientist, aren't you?

469
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,391
Aren't you supposed to have a theory?

470
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,829
These creatures
are absolutely unprecedented.

471
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,111
But where do they come from?

472
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,189
Yeah!

473
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,031
It doesn't matter where they come from.

474
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,798
No name.

475
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,629
We discovered them,
we should name them!

476
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,473
Forget the damn name!

477
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,750
Now me and Earl need to get
out of this valley.

478
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,030
Hang on. Let's not go off half-cocked.

479
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,591
Somebody's bound to come check on us
once they see the road is out...

480
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,319
...and the lines are down.
- That's how it works.

481
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,236
- "Suckoids."
- "Oids." I like "snakeoids."

482
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,915
One of them comes near me
and I'll hit him with a five-pound pickax.

483
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,271
You don't understand. They come up
from the ground and grab you.

484
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,920
They sense the slightest vibration
through the ground.

485
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,560
Even footsteps. That's how they hunt.

486
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,911
So we don't vibrate, right?

487
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,756
Maybe they won't even come through here.

488
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,678
Maybe they'll leave us alone!

489
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,230
Chain saw. That's what I'll use.

490
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,469
Wake up!

491
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,154
Now, look!

492
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,917
They're headed right for us!

493
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,153
They trapped Edgar here.
Grabbed old Fred right here.

494
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,915
Nailed those two poor suckers on the road
and the doctor's place is here!

495
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,193
This valley is just one long smorgasbord.

496
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,472
We have got to get out.

497
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,999
I'm going to get Mindy.

498
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,640
She's okay.
I saw her playing down the street.

499
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,789
That's what I like, "Graboids"!
That's it, "graboids"!

500
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,639
Jesus, Walter.

501
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,109
We're going to be sorry
if we don't give it a name.

502
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,149
Okay, you say let's get out of here.
Where are we supposed to go?

503
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,310
Rhonda's got an idea about that.

504
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,950
See, they move very easily
through the Pleistocene alluvials.

505
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,196
The dirt. The loose soil
that covers the valley floor.

506
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,998
But they can't move through rock.

507
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,590
- We should go west to the mountains.
- She means up the old Jeep trail.

508
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,875
If those mountains are granite
we'd be safe.

509
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,269
We could hike along them to Bixby if we...

510
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,992
I scared you, didn't I?

511
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,118
You little ass wipe.

512
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,749
You don't knock it off,
you're going to be shitting this basketball.

513
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,439
Pardon my French.

514
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,038
It's going to take us days
to get back with help with Nestor.

515
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,270
We're not going to leave you alone.

516
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,312
- Damn it! I'm going to kick his ass!
- I'm going to help you.

517
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,716
Where is that little shit stain?

518
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,358
Melvin, get your...

519
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,875
Get inside!

520
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,478
- Run! Come on!
- Come on, get in!

521
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,074
- Walter, you got a gun?
- No!

522
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,194
- What are we going to do?
- Be quiet!

523
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,555
Where is he?

524
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,996
Now remember, no noise, no vibrations.

525
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,478
No, Mindy.

526
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,710
Stop.

527
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,677
Mindy, get off the pogo stick.

528
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,351
- Get her, Val!
- Mindy, come back!

529
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,599
Be quiet. Don't move.

530
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,271
Mindy, get back.

531
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,437
Run! Get in the house!

532
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,476
Get him off or it'll suck that truck down.

533
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,992
Go back, for Chrissake!

534
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,238
Jesus, here comes another one!

535
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,952
Run! Come on!

536
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,519
Get out of your pants!

537
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,115
Look out!

538
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,550
Run!

539
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,677
Don't look back. Come on!

540
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,870
Sorry.

541
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,593
- Rhonda, here.
- Thank you.

542
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,234
What are we going to do?
How long 'til they go away?

543
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,996
They got the patience of Job.

544
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,509
They sit and wait until they hear
something that sounds like lunch.

545
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,359
- We've got to have a plan.
- I got a plan.

546
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,792
You drive the truck up to the mountain,
walk to Bixby, get some help.

547
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,879
- Those scumsuckers ate our radials.
- You can take my truck.

548
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,194
No, we need a major four-wheel drive
just to get up that Jeep trail.

549
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,672
That trail's all messed up.

550
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,552
Turn it off!

551
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,070
Pull it back!

552
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,954
I got it.

553
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,918
Give me your hand!

554
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,718
Son of a bitch.

555
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,559
Son of a bitch!

556
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,077
Come on, let's go! The roof!

557
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,590
Come on!

558
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,754
- Jump! You can do it!
- I can't!

559
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,034
Don't stop. Keep moving!

560
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,638
Oh, my God.

561
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,869
You okay?

562
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,315
What's going on? Where are you guys?

563
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,798
What's up?
What the hell are you doing up there?

564
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,917
Shut the hell up.

565
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,837
- Get up on your roof.
- No way!

566
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,000
Nancy, get up on your roofs.

567
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,271
Up on your roofs!
They come through the floor.

568
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,949
I don't know. I can't believe it.

569
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,234
No tracks.

570
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,230
No sign. No spoor.

571
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,028
You'd think after eating all those sheep
they'd have to take a dump someplace.

572
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,156
Yeah. I don't understand it.

573
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,480
<i>Walter, this is Burt. Come back.</i>

574
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,434
<i>Walter? Anybody copy?</i>

575
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,513
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

576
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,997
<i>- Walter, you there? Come back!</i>
- Okay, I got it.

577
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,509
<i>Who's minding the store, for God's sake?</i>

578
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,429
Burt, listen.
We found out what's been killing people.

579
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,517
- Say "over."
- Over.

580
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,110
Negative copy on that, Walter.
Check your frequency.

581
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,310
I'm on 22. Come back.

582
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,159
<i>Burt, can you hear me now? Over.</i>

583
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,516
Is that you?
What're you doing back already?

584
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,716
Something real weird's going on
over there.

585
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,358
They're up on top of the roof.

586
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,030
I think they're going for Burt's.

587
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,277
Man! They're going!

588
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,992
Burt, get out of your basement.
Take your radio.

589
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,476
You and Heather get up on your roof.
We'll talk later. Over.

590
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,075
Up on the roof?
What are you talking about?

591
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,720
Damn it, Burt. Listen to him.
Something's wrong.

592
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,839
<i>Burt, Jesus Christ!</i>

593
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,037
Get up on your roof! The things!

594
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,873
<i>They're under the ground.</i>
<i>They're bigger than we thought.</i>

595
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,270
<i>They're huge. They're coming after you.</i>
<i>They're coming right now!</i>

596
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,310
We don't see anything. What the hell
are you talking about? Over.

597
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,753
They're under the ground!

598
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,435
<i>They can dig. Big monsters!</i>
<i>Underground! Now get out!</i>

599
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,714
<i>Hurry!</i>

600
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,434
<i>Jesus...</i>

601
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,153
Burt, come on.

602
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,354
Magazine!

603
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,679
Here!

604
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,753
Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room,
didn't you, you bastard?

605
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,354
<i>We killed it! You got that?</i>
<i>We killed that motherhumper! Come back.</i>

606
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,798
Roger that, Burt. And congratulations.

607
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,873
Be advised, however, there are two more.
Repeat, two more motherhumpers.

608
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,718
Burt got one! He killed one!

609
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,356
- Way to go, dude!
- All right!

610
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,751
I guess we don't get to make fun
of Burt's lifestyle anymore.

611
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,910
Say, Burt?

612
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,794
<i>Any chance you can get the other two?</i>
<i>Come back.</i>

613
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,592
One second, pal.

614
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,913
You didn't get penetration
even with the elephant gun.

615
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,993
Good Lord!

616
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,795
<i>We can't get 'em.</i>

617
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,509
<i>I never figured</i>
<i>on having to shoot through dirt.</i>

618
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,353
<i>The best goddamn bullet stop there is.</i>
<i>Come back.</i>

619
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,314
Let me see that.

620
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,951
Forget shooting them.
Can you get to your truck?

621
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,429
<i>- Over.</i>
- No problem.

622
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,239
<i>You have the only truck</i>
<i>that can get up that Jeep trail.</i>

623
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,198
Now listen. Here's the plan.

624
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,078
You and Heather go for help.
You get to the mountains and...

625
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,878
You guys!

626
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,638
- Come over.
- Hang on a sec.

627
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,716
- He's up to something.
- If it isn't our old pal Stumpy.

628
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,269
Bastard.

629
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,510
What do you think it's trying to do?

630
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,871
Why do you keep asking me?

631
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,759
What the hell was that?

632
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,553
<i>Breaker there, Earl.</i>
<i>What did you want us to do?</i>

633
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,669
<i>Come back.</i>

634
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,672
Hang on, Burt.
This bastard's trying something new.

635
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,830
Over.

636
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,314
They wasn't making no noise.
Why is he bothering them?

637
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,557
It's like it's studying the buildings,
trying to figure them out.

638
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,912
They can feel our vibrations
but they can't find us.

639
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,469
Looks to me
like they're coming up with a plan.

640
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,872
Watch it, Nestor!

641
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,477
Shit! Enough!

642
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,239
- Get off the ground! Get moving!
- Get out of there!

643
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,269
Move it!

644
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,677
No, that's no good!
You've got to get higher!

645
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,431
No way!

646
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,954
No! You guys have got to do something!

647
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,390
You've got to do something!

648
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,430
<i>Burt? Heather?</i>

649
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,190
You got us. Come on back. Over.

650
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,116
<i>We're in deep shit over here.</i>
<i>We'll have to change that plan.</i>

651
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,189
- Burt, cut it out!
- I think I scared him.

652
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,959
<i>No use going for help.</i>

653
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,108
<i>We'd be dead</i>
<i>long before you'd ever get back.</i>

654
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,069
<i>We're with you.</i>
<i>Tell us what you want to do.</i>

655
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,629
This one's going to tear this town
out from under us.

656
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,950
We're going to have to
get out of here together...

657
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,758
...<i>now.</i>
- Okay.

658
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,752
We're coming after everybody.
Just hang tight. Over.

659
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,355
<i>You're going to have to</i>
<i>forget about the truck.</i>

660
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,392
Yeah, we've got you, Heather.

661
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,393
The situation hasn't changed.

662
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,791
We still have to make it to solid rock.
There's got to be a way.

663
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,868
Like what? There's nothing left
that can make it to those mountains.

664
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,153
Quiet, man.

665
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,950
It doesn't matter now.
They know we're here.

666
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,070
We need a helicopter. Or a goddamn tank!

667
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,710
Wait a minute. The Cat!

668
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,151
- Could we take the Cat?
- Jesus. It's slower than hell.

669
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,876
But it weighs more than 30 tons.
There's no way they could lift that.

670
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,669
- Could they? I mean...
- But we can't all fit on the bulldozer.

671
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,432
No, but we could...

672
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,078
...drag something, though.
We could pull a car behind it. I don't know.

673
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,995
Hell, that old semitrailer.

674
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,631
- Its tires are flat.
- Doesn't matter.

675
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,591
That Cat can pull anything.

676
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,552
- We just roll on out of here.
- We've got a plan!

677
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,119
Of course, that's a hell of a long walk.

678
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,709
They only respond to vibration, right?

679
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,348
Couldn't we distract them somehow?

680
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,276
Good. Something to keep 'em busy.
Like a decoy.

681
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,910
Melvin, you want to make a buck?

682
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,436
Eat it!

683
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,115
How about Walter's little tractor?
Start him up.

684
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,238
Let him go out by himself.

685
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,357
Let those things follow him all over
if they like that noise.

686
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,630
Not bad. What do you think?

687
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,317
Ground's getting closer.
I say we go with Miguel's plan.

688
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,233
Hold on, Nancy!

689
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,515
- I'm making the run for the Cat.
- Like hell.

690
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,239
- I'm faster than you.
- But I'm best at driving the Cat.

691
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,074
- Not while I'm around.
- Listen to me. I'm older and wiser.

692
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,958
Well you're half right.

693
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,317
Damn! I lost. Guess I'll have to do it.

694
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,518
I won. I pick who does it.

695
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,998
Ready when you are, Miguel.

696
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,148
There he is. There he goes!

697
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,435
He's chasing it!

698
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,718
It's going. This one's going, too!

699
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,391
- Good luck, shithead.
- Don't worry about me, jerk-off.

700
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,598
You suicidal son of a bitch.

701
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,148
Keep going!

702
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,559
Oh, my God.

703
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,796
Come on!

704
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,559
They're going to get him!

705
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,158
Val, stop! They're coming! Be quiet!

706
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,389
Don't move!

707
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,280
It worked. They can't find him.

708
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,994
We've got to...

709
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,998
...make some noise.

710
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,793
A lot of noise!

711
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,716
You sorry sons of bitches.
Come and get my ass!

712
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,315
Over here, you slime bucket!
Come get me!

713
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,830
What are you, scared? Come on.

714
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,989
What's she doing?

715
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,752
That did it, girl! Goddamn good thinking.

716
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,153
- You okay?
- Yeah.

717
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,356
Here goes.

718
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,949
- Here.
- Yeah.

719
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,472
Goddamn! Armored transport.

720
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,551
Let's get going!

721
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,678
Come on, let's go, you two.
We're headed for the mountains.

722
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,308
If that's how we're doing it,
we're going prepared.

723
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,671
We can't hold still long.
These things are damn smart.

724
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,228
- They're getting smarter by the minute.
- Fine.

725
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,591
We've got some new things to teach 'em.

726
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,034
You see that?

727
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,597
They're doing it again.
They try it every time we stop!

728
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,875
Jesus Christ! We're only going nine miles.

729
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,476
Those things will be on our ass
every foot of the way, right?

730
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,836
- Just hurry!
- What are you doing up there?

731
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,388
- Can't you see we are sinking.
- Get in the trailer!

732
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,948
What do you think? Max firepower or this?

733
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,113
I go for penetration. The.458,
shooting solids. Less ammo to carry.

734
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,872
Come on. Move it!

735
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,512
Watch these ammo boxes!

736
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,389
- Come on, Burt!
- Heather, hurry!

737
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,956
- Tell 'em to come on!
- Okay, now!

738
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,077
Now! Come on!

739
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,398
Give me a gun. I'll take one.

740
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,438
I wouldn't give you a gun
if it was World War III.

741
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,908
Food for five years.

742
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,639
1,000 gallons of gas,
air and water filtration, Geiger counter...

743
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,592
...bomb shelter.

744
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,477
Underground. Goddamn monsters!

745
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,594
There we go! Fallen Rock.

746
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,513
Any sign of them?

747
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,510
Maybe they just gave up, you know?

748
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,989
What's that?

749
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,508
Damn it! What the hell are they doing?

750
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:54,752
I don't care what they're doing
as long as they're doing it way over there.

751
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,918
Wait! Look out!

752
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,712
- Burt, you okay?
- I'm okay.

753
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,836
Are they going to get us? What happened?

754
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,360
- Burt, you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

755
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,319
What happened?

756
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,713
They dug a trap.

757
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,633
I can't believe this.

758
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,788
All right.

759
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,550
Here.

760
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,874
Let me have my gun.

761
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,795
Hungry? Eat this!

762
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,038
Everybody down!

763
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,115
There they are!

764
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,751
- Did you kill one?
- I don't know.

765
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,553
No, there's still two of them.

766
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,712
- There're two different dust trails.
- Made them think twice.

767
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,074
What's in those?

768
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,674
A few household chemicals
in the proper proportion.

769
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,791
Here they come. They're coming back!

770
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,396
We'll have to make a run for those rocks.

771
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,632
- I don't know. That's a long way.
- They'll get us!

772
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,234
They're going to get us if we stay here.

773
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,032
- You have any more of those bombs?
- We've got you covered.

774
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,193
What if we throw one that way, the way
we want to go? Then when it explodes...

775
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,357
...if it drives them away,
we run like goddamn bastards.

776
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,309
Pardon my French.

777
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,559
What if they don't get scared?
What if they don't run?

778
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,629
I don't think it does scare them.
It hurts them.

779
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,836
They're sensitive to sound, they'll run.

780
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,512
Hell, she's got my vote!

781
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,154
That's it! We're making a run for it!

782
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:09,277
- We're going for the rocks.
- I don't know. They're too fast.

783
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,751
- You can't out run 'em. No way!
- This'll make 'em think twice.

784
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,877
Everybody ready to run?

785
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,118
Heads down!

786
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,077
It worked! There they go!

787
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,475
Let's go!

788
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,799
Come on, Burt.

789
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,439
You asshole!

790
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,154
Get up.

791
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,276
- Get up here!
- I'm with you, honey.

792
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,638
Go!

793
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,072
You asshole!
There are no bullets in this gun.

794
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,518
Got you moving, didn't it?

795
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,313
So now what?

796
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,391
Could we make it to the mountains?
Use Burt's explosives?

797
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,715
No way.

798
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,078
We'd need 50 of those bombs.

799
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,709
That's it.

800
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,478
We're not getting off this rock.

801
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,315
We're not going to pole vault out of here.
That's for damn sure.

802
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,992
Wait a minute. What're you talking about?

803
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,232
It's like you're giving up.

804
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:18,393
They'll wait out there 'til we're dead.
That's exactly what they do.

805
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,915
Wait!

806
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:26,272
For Chrissake, we could've made a stand
at our place. We had food, water...

807
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,192
You can't fight 'em like that.

808
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:31,192
So you two screw-ups
hauled us way the hell out here?

809
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,237
Why don't you just back off, string bean?
We could've left your ass on the roof!

810
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,392
I wish you had, fearless leader.
Who put you two in charge?

811
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,630
Don't push me!

812
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,670
If them graboids don't kill him, I will.

813
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:51,956
What?

814
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,389
They'd have torn up your place
in half an hour.

815
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,756
Come on. Just let it go. Forget about it.

816
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,634
I know he does.
He thinks he knows everything.

817
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,196
If it comes to starvation,
I know what I'm doing.

818
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,239
Take one of these...

819
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:25,312
...walk right out there with the fuse lit
and let 'em take me down.

820
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,798
Good Lord, honey.

821
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,192
Now that's not a bad idea.

822
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,557
No. It gives me an idea.

823
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,308
Going fishing.

824
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,316
There's one. Straight out in front.

825
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,876
Let's see if we can keep him right there.

826
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,918
- How much we need?
- I don't know. They're pretty quick.

827
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,553
Fifteen seconds at least.

828
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,480
- Which kind of fuse is that?
- Cannon fuse.

829
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,393
- What the hell you use if for?
- My cannon.

830
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,831
You guys watch yourselves.

831
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,876
Right out there, about 30...

832
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,113
- You're not going do your lasso thing?
- Just 'cause you're no good with a rope.

833
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,273
All right, get back!

834
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,869
Come on, baby.

835
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,317
Take it. Take the bait!

836
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,718
Yeah! All right!

837
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,389
Look at it!

838
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,032
Okay, one to go.

839
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,437
Damn! Where the hell is he?

840
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,592
Hope he didn't wise up.

841
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,548
There.

842
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,834
Look who it is.

843
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,438
Give me that thing.

844
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,757
This son of a bitch is mine.

845
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,319
There it goes!

846
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,592
- All right, get back!
- I got it.

847
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,909
Come on.

848
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,437
Come on. Lunchtime, slophead.

849
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,879
All right, get down!

850
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,553
Oh, my God! It's coming...

851
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,238
Get back! Run!

852
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,035
Get up, come on!

853
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,431
What're you doing out there?

854
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,669
Okay, let's make some noise.
Try to distract them.

855
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,515
Fresh meat!

856
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,388
Wait.

857
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,076
This one's not falling for it.

858
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,558
This one ain't dumb.

859
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,392
He's trying to trick us.

860
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,873
Use your bomb.

861
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,436
It's our last one.

862
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,438
What else you going use it for?

863
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,919
So what if we make it to the rocks.
We'll be dead in three days anyway.

864
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,471
I want to live for the three days.

865
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,398
What the hell? What's the matter?

866
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,597
- Use the bomb, for God's sake!
- Throw that bomb, man!

867
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,751
Scare 'em away!

868
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,192
Throw the bomb!

869
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,836
This bastard ain't smarter than us.

870
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,031
For Chrissake, Val!

871
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,469
- I'm going to go for it.
- Go for what?

872
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,277
- What are you doing?
- I got a goddamn plan!

873
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,554
Where the hell is it?

874
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,033
I've got it!

875
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,714
This better be one hell of a great plan!

876
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,115
Get ready!

877
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,951
- Light it, man!
- Not yet.

878
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,919
What are you waiting for?

879
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,429
Go!

880
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,914
Come on!

881
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,396
Too far! You threw it behind him.

882
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,875
Run!

883
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,190
Can you fly, you sucker?

884
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,793
It just suddenly hit me, you know.

885
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,039
Stampede.

886
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,355
Now...

887
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,878
...the second we hit Bixby,
we start making phone calls.

888
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,514
We could make some real money
on this thing.

889
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,875
We could get in <i>People</i> magazine.

890
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,793
<i>People</i>? Hell! National Geographic.

891
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,795
Smile.

892
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,992
Burt loaned me his camera.

893
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,390
Yeah. He gave us these tires, too.

894
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,271
It's all pretty exciting, huh?

895
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,392
There's going to be research,
and I'm going to be in on it.

896
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:53,996
The first thing to do
is take pictures of that one we dug up.

897
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,669
Yeah. Pictures seem like a good idea.

898
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,637
Thanks for everything.
Saving my life and stuff.

899
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,273
You're welcome.

900
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,997
Maybe I'll see you sometime?

901
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,755
See ya.

902
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,717
I know! I'm working up to it.

903
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,674
What am I doing?

904
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,753
What's a woman like her want
with a guy like me?

905
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,751
She's going for her damn Ph.D.

906
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,675
Yeah?

907
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,550
I just wanted to...

908
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,991
