I'm not hung up...

Hey, wait.
This stalled out your truck?

our roof every night when we're done.

finish the roof?

thing we gotta do

642
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:35,533
is see if old stumpy's
still out there.

643
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:39,161
Can I borrow
that shovel?

644
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:40,371
Yeah.

got down off that damn tower.

I have an idea.

650
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:58,848
we're gonna have to come
up with some sort of plan,

651
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:00,057
he's just gonna
wait us to death.

652
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:01,892
Yeah, well, I was...
- Why don't we just make a run for it?

653
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:03,519
We outran him yesterday.

654
00:42:03,602 --> 00:42:05,520
Run for it?
Running's not a plan.

655
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:07,647
Now running's what you do
when a plan fails.

656
00:42:07,732 --> 00:42:09,859
Valentine, you're not even
trying to think of a plan.

657
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:12,069
Well, it ain't like we got
a hell of a lot of options.

658
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:15,364
There's always options. We
just gotta think of them, that's all.

659
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:17,450
All right, well, why
don't you start thinking?

660
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,952
Why in the hell do I always
have to do all the thinking?

their tongues or something.

Where's Burt and Heather?

I can't reach them.

I guess they're still
driving around somewhere.

Hey, Rhonda, what's the
name you call those things?

Huh? Where do they come from?

00:44:56,775 --> 00:44:57,901
I don't know.

696
00:44:57,985 --> 00:44:59,319
You're a scientist,
aren't you?

697
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:02,531
Yeah, aren't you supposed
to have a theory or something?

698
00:45:02,615 --> 00:45:05,200
Look, these creatures
are absolutely unprecedented.

699
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:07,411
Yeah. But where do
they come from?

700
00:45:07,494 --> 00:45:08,620
Yeah!

701
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:13,291
It doesn't matter
where they come from.

No name? Ha!

703
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:18,630

we should name them!

the damn name!

better get the hell out of this valley.

Let's not go off half-cocked.

out and the lines are down.

Oids. I like snakeoids.

713
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:04,593
One of them comes near me, and I'll
just hit him with a five-pound pickax.

No. You don't
understand, Nestor.

715
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:08,263
They come up from underneath
the ground and they grab you.

716
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:10,766
They sense the slightest
vibration through the ground.

717
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:13,726
Even footsteps.
That's how they hunt.

718
00:46:13,811 --> 00:46:16,772
Hey, so like we don't
vibrate, right?

719
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:20,442
Maybe they won't even
come through here.

720
00:46:20,526 --> 00:46:22,611
Maybe they'll
leave us alone!

721

NESTOR: Chain saw.
That's what I'll use.

Now, look!

724
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:36,207
You see, they're
headed right for us.

725
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:37,793
Look, they trapped
Edgar here.

726
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:39,294
Grabbed old Fred
right here.

727
00:46:39,378 --> 00:46:41,129
Nailed those two poor
suckers on the road,

728
00:46:41,213 --> 00:46:43,548
and the doctor's place
is right here!

729
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:47,010
Now this valley is just
one long smorgasbord.

I'm gonna
go get Mindy.

00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:57,854

playing down the street.

We're gonna be sorry
if we don't give it a name.

736
00:47:06,864 --> 00:47:08,991
Okay, Val, you say
let's get out of here.

737
00:47:09,074 --> 00:47:11,367
So where are we
supposed to go?

738
00:47:11,452 --> 00:47:14,371
Well, Rhonda's got
an idea about that.

739
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,875
Yeah, see, they move very easily
through the Pleistocene alluvials.

740
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,837
The dirt.

741
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:25,131
The loose soil that
covers the valley floor.

742
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:27,175
But they can't
move through rock.

743
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:29,177
So I think we should
head west to the mountains.

744
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:30,845
She means up
the old jeep trail.

745
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:33,348
If those mountains are solid
granite, we'd be safe there.

746
00:47:33,432 --> 00:47:35,142
And we could hike along them
all the way to Bixby if we...

It's slower than hell.

984

Yeah, but it weighs
better than 30 tons.

There's no way they
could lift 30 tons.

fit on the bulldozer.

No, but we could
drag something, though.

990

behind it. I don't know.

Yeah. Good.

No, there's still
two of them.

different dust trails.

think twice though.

those things, Burt?

a run for those rocks.

a hell of a long way.

gonna get us if we stay here.

any more of those bombs?

We've got you
covered, Rhonda.

Well, what if we throw one that
way, the way that we wanna go?

1135

Then when it explodes, I
mean, if it drives them away,

scared? What if they don't run?

1140

I don't think it does
scare them. It hurts them.

I've got it!

1275
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,825
EARL: This better be
one hell of a great plan!

1276
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:20,542
Get ready!

1277
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:22,878
Light it, man! Light it!

1278
01:28:22,962 --> 01:28:24,088
Not yet. Not yet!

1279
01:28:24,172 --> 01:28:26,257
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

1280
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:28,300
Go!

1281
01:28:29,552 --> 01:28:32,012
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1282
01:28:33,264 --> 01:28:35,391
Too far!
You threw it behind him.

1283
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,191
Run, Val! Run!

1284
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:50,239
Yeah!

1285
01:28:52,116 --> 01:28:55,410
Can you fly, you sucker?
Can you fly?

1286
01:29:23,147 --> 01:29:27,067
Well, it just suddenly
hit me, you know.

1287
01:29:28,027 --> 01:29:29,319
Stampede.

1288
01:29:29,445 --> 01:29:30,779
(CHUCKLING)

1289
01:29:31,072 --> 01:29:32,740
(OTHERS CHEERING)

1290
01:29:35,952 --> 01:29:37,787
BURT: Way to go!

1291
01:29:37,871 --> 01:29:39,622
Way to go, Val!

1292
01:29:46,379 --> 01:29:50,879
Now, the second we hit Bixby,
we start making some phone calls.

1293
01:29:51,426 --> 01:29:53,886
I mean, we could make
some real money on this thing.

1294
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:56,514
We could get in
<i>People</i> magazine.

1295
01:29:56,598 --> 01:29:59,767
<i>People?</i> Hell!
<i>National Geographic.</i>

1296
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:02,311
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1297
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:05,898
Smile.

1298
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:19,662
Burt loaned me
his camera.

1299
01:30:19,746 --> 01:30:22,165
Yeah. He gave us
these tires, too.

1300
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:29,255
It's all pretty
exciting, huh?

1301
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:33,968
There's gonna be major
research, and I'm gonna be in on it.

1302
01:30:34,802 --> 01:30:38,514
The first thing to do is take some
pictures of that one we dug up.

1303
01:30:39,182 --> 01:30:41,017
Yeah. Yeah.

1304
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,519
Pictures seem
like a good idea.

1305
01:30:46,022 --> 01:30:47,440
Yeah, well,
thanks for everything,

1306
01:30:47,523 --> 01:30:49,650
you know,
saving my life and stuff.

1307
01:30:52,654 --> 01:30:54,072
You're welcome.

1308
01:30:56,449 --> 01:30:58,075
Maybe I'll see you sometime?

1309
01:30:58,159 --> 01:30:59,368
Uh-huh.

1310
01:31:09,128 --> 01:31:11,755
Well, see you.

1311
01:31:18,554 --> 01:31:21,306
I know. I know!
I'm working up to it.

1312
01:31:22,475 --> 01:31:23,893
What am I doing?

1313
01:31:23,977 --> 01:31:27,063
I mean, what's a woman like
her want with a guy like me?

1314
01:31:27,146 --> 01:31:29,398
She's going
for her damn Ph.D.

1315
01:31:32,235 --> 01:31:33,486
Rhonda?

1316
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,487
Yeah?

1317
01:31:35,571 --> 01:31:38,282
Well, I just
wanted to...
