1
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,017


2
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:01,492
Good morning, Mr. Basset. This is your wake-up call.

3
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:03,834
Please move your ass.

4
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,679
Stampede!

5
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:24,329
Stampede, Earl! Get out of the way!

6
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,265
You dumb shit.

7
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,353
l was in a stampede once.

8
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:38,690
300 head going hell-bent for the horizon.

9
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:43,150
Exactly how many cows are required for a stampede, Earl?

10
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:46,615
l mean, is it like three or more? ls there a minimum speed?

11
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:49,111
l wish a stampede up your ass.

12
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,938
No breakfast?

13
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:26,410
l did it yesterday. lt was bologna and beans.

14
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,956
No. lt was eggs. l did eggs...

15
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,532
...over easy.

16
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:36,459
The hell you did. Bologna and beans. lt's your turn.

17
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:47,759
l guess when l'm your age...

18
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:49,811
...l'll forget what l eat, too.

19
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:57,814
Goddamn it!

20
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:01,491
l ask you, is this a job for intelligent men?

21
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,319
Show me one. l'll ask him.

22
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:07,621
lf we were serious about money, we'd quit being hired hands.

23
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:10,957
Handymen, Earl. We are handymen.

24
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,288
We should quit this job...

25
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,621
...and find ourselves some real employment.

26
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:18,385
Are you going to give up all this personal freedom?

27
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:19,714
l don't know.

28
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:34,933
Freeway!

29
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:37,732
What's on the agenda for today?

30
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:41,192
-lt's garbage day. -Man! Already?

31
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:43,493
What's Nestor paying us?

32
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,706
$50. And that's $47 more than we got.

33
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:51,752
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their linoleum today...

34
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,416
...and the garbage tomorrow.

35
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:56,673
Nestor's not home tomorrow. We don't dig today, we're not paid.

36
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:59,127
Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.

37
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,963
You never take the long view. Here it is Monday...

38
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:04,300
...and l'm already thinking of Wednesday.

39
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,681
lt is Monday, right?

40
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:13,402
Who the hell's that? That's not the grad student?

41
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,654
-No. He graduated. Must be the new one. -The new one?

42
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:20,194
That's supposed to be a girl.

43
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:30,792
You will have long, blonde hair...

44
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,794
...big green eyes, world-class breasts...

45
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:38,513
...ass that won't quit and legs that go all the way up!

46
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:52,318
Hi! l'm Rhonda LeBeck. l'm up here for the semester.

47
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,855
-Yeah, geography. -Geology.

48
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:58,444
Well, actually seismology. Earthquakes.

49
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,745
You two must be Val and Earl.

50
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:03,619
-l've heard all about you. -We deny everything.

51
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:07,586
l've got a question for you.

52
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:10,708
Do you know if anybody's doing any drilling or blasting...

53
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,460
...or anything like that?

54
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:16,133
Around here? No, ma'am.

55
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:20,184
l'm supposed to monitor the seismographs.

56
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:23,303
You know, they measure vibrations.

57
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,481
Vibrations in the ground.

58
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:26,849
Yeah.

59
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:30,987
l've been getting some really strange readings.

60
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:35,194
The school's had the machines here, and we've never recorded anything like this.

61
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:38,820
We'll ask around. See if anyone's heard anything.

62
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:40,912
Thanks.

63
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,040
God, l hope they're not broken. l might have to bag the whole semester.

64
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,920
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

65
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:49,587
No problem.

66
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:52,673
Nice meeting you. Hope you get it all sorted out.

67
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:11,360
lf you wanted, we could take a look at those...

68
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:14,826
...seismographs for her if you want.

69
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:17,319
What the hell do we know about seismographs?

70
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:18,613
Nothing.

71
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:21,753
-lt might be a slick way to get to know her. -Why?

72
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,331
Damn it, Valentine.

73
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:28,214
You don't go for any gal unless she fits your list, top to bottom.

74
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:30,792
-Well sure! -lt's dumber than my hind end.

75
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:32,346
l mean, like that...

76
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:34,718
...Bobby Lynn Dexter.

77
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,518
Tammy Lynn Baxter.

78
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,724
lt don't matter. They're all the same: dead weight.

79
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:41,982
''Oh, l broke a nail!''

80
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,777
Makes my skin crawl.

81
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,733
l'm a victim of circumstance.

82
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,366
l thought you call it your pecker.

83
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,149
Pizza-face!

84
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:27,111
Melvin.

85
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:30,077
You touch that truck and die.

86
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:33,697
Man, l'm really shaking.

87
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:37,658
Thanks, Walter.

88
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:40,998
These are hollow points, but not hydro-shock hollow points.

89
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,926
-Bullets are bullets. -Hi, guys. What's happening?

90
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,632
We ran into that new college student, that Rona.

91
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:50,257
Rhonda. She's having trouble with her...

92
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,009
...things.

93
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:57,891
Those college kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...

94
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:04,023
...next thing the Feds will be at our door. ''Sorry. Time to move. Eminent domain.''

95
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,615
Down, honey. Down.

96
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,859
Yeah, Burt. The way you worry...

97
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:11,867
...you'll get a heart attack before you get a chance to survive World War lll.

98
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,119
We'll see.

99
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:20,253
Guys, listen. Bearing going out. What do you think?

100
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,718
-Could be. -Later, Chang. We got a schedule to keep.

101
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:28,098
Yeah. See, we plan ahead. That way we don't do anything right now.

102
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:29,381
Earl explained it to me.

103
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:19,127
Cocktail?

104
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,046
You bet.

105
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:28,220
l'll tell you.

106
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:31,022
Nobody handles garbage better than we do.

107
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:38,448
Come on, Earl. This is low.

108
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:41,865
We have got to set our sights a little bit higher.

109
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:51,083
Melvin, why don't you give us a hand? Most of this shit is yours anyway.

110
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:55,750
Listen, run to the store and pick me up a six-pack. l'll pay for it.

111
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:58,260
Son, beer is for adults.

112
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:03,726
Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this.

113
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:06,974
Just doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.

114
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:11,736
Are you going to stand there and tell me l'm the reason we're still in Perfection?

115
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:14,573
You know how close l am to leaving this place right now?

116
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:17,231
l'll call that little bluff. How close?

117
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:21,279
-Shit! -Goddamn!

118
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,075
Jesus Christ! Goddamn!

119
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:30,167
Don't forget the TV.

120
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,586
-Why you bringing the vacuum cleaner? -l like it.

121
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:36,300
-You never use it. -lt's good for parts.

122
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:41,970
Besides, maybe we'll hire a maid. You think about that?

123
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,474
Get in the truck.

124
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,605
Guys!

125
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,827
Guys, wait!

126
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:05,372
Sorry, Nancy. We're not delivering firewood anymore.

127
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,245
-We're heading for Bixby permanent. -Sure.

128
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,550
Oh, my God. You really are!

129
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:15,718
Mindy, what's the count?

130
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:17,551
640.

131
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,936
l don't need firewood. l have this big order to fill and have to build my pottery kiln.

132
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,938
Come on, it'll be at least a month's work.

133
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,528
l'll throw in lunches.

134
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,069
And beer.

135
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:39,906
l can't believe we said no to free beer.

136
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:44,502
We did it! We faced temptation and did not bend!

137
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,381
Goddamn! Praise the Lord!

138
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:51,210
Now there's nothing, and l mean nothing, between us and Bixby.

139
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:58,473
Look at that guy!

140
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,642
That's one job l'd never do. Working around electricity.

141
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,733
Hold up.

142
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:05,688
That's Edgar Deems.

143
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:07,520
Come on.

144
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:10,279
He only wears that one damn jacket.

145
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:12,527
That's him, l'm telling you.

146
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,674
He sure must've been drunk this time.

147
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:31,053
Get your butt down from there!

148
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,809
Shit.

149
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:42,143
We can't leave him up there.

150
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:53,282
Thank you, Edgar.

151
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,378
You owe me on this one, you damned old boozehound.

152
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,547
One of these days, you'll have to get your ass on a wagon and stay there.

153
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,183
lt's not like l don't have better things to do than climb towers...

154
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,887
...and drag your hairy ass down.

155
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,141
Jesus!

156
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,493
Was it a heart attack, doctor?

157
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:32,572
No.

158
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:36,241
He died of dehydration. Thirst.

159
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:40,421
That doesn't make any sense. That takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

160
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,086
Maybe even three or four.

161
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:46,051
You mean he sat up there three or four days?

162
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,465
He sat up there and just died of thirst?

163
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:02,383
You reckon he hated Perfection more than us?

164
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:07,722
-Do you suppose he wanted to kill himself? -Somebody must've chased him up there.

165
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,307
You mean someone that ain't scared of a Winchester rifle?

166
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:16,565
Then what'd they do? Camp out and wait for him to die?

167
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:20,027
What the hell?

168
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:37,716
What the shit?

169
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:41,134
Fred!

170
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,458
-This is weird. -This is real weird.

171
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,998
-Jesus! -What the hell's going on?

172
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:15,877
l mean, what the hell is going on?

173
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:28,483
Get the hell out of here! There's a killer on the loose!

174
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:31,358
-What? -A murderer, man! A real psycho!

175
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:34,323
He's cutting people's heads off. l'm not kidding!

176
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,490
They're pulling our chain.

177
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:40,618
Yeah.

178
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,096
What?

179
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:08,941
Howard!

180
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:13,480
Carmine?

181
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,127
Who could be doing it?

182
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:28,423
l'm not accusing anybody, but some of my cattle are missing.

183
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,750
Are you serious? Old Fred's dead?

184
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:34,467
-You're bullshitting me. -What happened to Fred?

185
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:35,849
Worse than Edgar.

186
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,091
-What happened to him? -You won't believe it.

187
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:41,685
-l need a candy bar. -l don't believe this. The phone's dead.

188
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:44,228
-Walter, your phone is dead! -l didn't do it.

189
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,060
Nestor, what's happening?

190
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:49,653
-Somebody killed old Fred. -What's going on?

191
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:55,072
Val, you've got to get to Bixby, and get the police up here. And step on it.

192
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:58,747
Consider it stepped on.

193
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:09,593
We decided to leave this place one damn day too late, you know?

194
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,216
There's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.

195
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,970
Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.

196
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,390
Look out!

197
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,228
ls there some higher force at work here?

198
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,488
l mean, are we asking too much of life?

199
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:32,610
Where the hell are these guys?

200
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,489
What are they doing? Blasting?

201
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,494
Where are you guys? lt's not like there's another road, assholes!

202
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:13,951
-Jesus! l don't believe this! -You're hung up.

203
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:16,788
l am not!

204
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,957
You're hung up, l tell you!

205
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:24,632
You're going to burn the clutch!

206
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,271
-You could break an axle like that. -Could you shut up?

207
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:41,476
l don't need to spend the night out here.

208
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,815
Crybaby.

209
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:49,452
-Could it have been coyotes? -No way.

210
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:51,365
Coyotes didn't kill Fred.

211
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:54,783
lt's Val and Earl.

212
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:56,996
They shouldn't be here already.

213
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,459
-Thought you two were in Bixby by now. -You're won't believe this.

214
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,758
-Mom! -Oh, my God!

215
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,052
-Burt, be careful. -Unreal.

216
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,642
-Where'd you get it? -l didn't know we had it.

217
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,184
-lt's disgusting. -Some kind of snake?

218
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,697
-lt's more like an eel to me. -Eels live in the water, don't they?

219
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,940
-Big mother slug, maybe. -Don't touch!

220
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,610
Relax. lt's dead.

221
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:47,016
lt must've grabbed us!

222
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:49,888
-That's why the truck stalled. -l said l wasn't hung up.

223
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:51,639
This stalled out your truck?

224
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,600
lt'd have to be one strong son of a bitch.

225
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:58,024
Stinks, too.

226
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:01,028
l'll give you boys $5 for this.

227
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:04,281
$20.

228
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:06,743
-Okay, $10! -$15.

229
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,453
-Okay, $15. -Damn right, $15.

230
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:13,372
l don't believe you guys.

231
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,459
Could be a snake!

232
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:19,676
Some kind of mutation.

233
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:26,345
Whatever it is...

234
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,681
...just one of these couldn't eat up Fred and his whole flock of sheep.

235
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,225
You think there are more out there?

236
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,835
l'm dead. Let's put this stuff up in the morning.

237
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:57,298
We have to go to Bixby in the morning.

238
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:02,425
-The cinder blocks are in. -The cinder blocks. Oh, my God!

239
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:05,810
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.

240
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,555
That's the sky that'll be over our roof every night when we're done.

241
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:14,727
What if we don't finish the roof? Then we can look at the sky all the time.

242
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:20,325
That damn thing.

243
00:23:28,962 --> 00:23:31,667
Maybe it's time we buy a new generator.

244
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:39,962
lt's gone!

245
00:23:40,182 --> 00:23:42,093
What do you mean, it's gone?

246
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,768
You sure this is where it was?

247
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:52,567
lt was right here! There's the cord. Hold this.

248
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:04,331
Maybe the ground caved in. There's mines and stuff around here.

249
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,793
Well, don't then. You don't want to fall in.

250
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:16,801
Let's go.

251
00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:19,342
God, what is that stink?

252
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,677
You hear that?

253
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:28,398
Come on. Let's just go.

254
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:32,694
Let's go back to town or something. Please, Jim!

255
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:36,194
Maybe it's a geological thing like natural gas...

256
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:40,202
...or a geyser. They stink like that. Remember in Yellowstone?

257
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,537
Something's got me!

258
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,333
Something's got me down here!

259
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:58,763
Get something. Get me out of here!

260
00:25:07,112 --> 00:25:09,983
Something's got me. Please get me out!

261
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:13,821
Help me!

262
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:38,312
Oh, my God.

263
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:45,294
-Don't look so afraid. lt won't hurt you. -Mindy look up. Smile.

264
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:46,715
Hold it.

265
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,797
Melvin, get out of there!

266
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:56,436
-Old Chang, slick as snot, and l ain't lying. -A lousy $15.

267
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,352
A man who plans ahead.

268
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:05,151
We arm ourselves, we set perimeters, we stand guard.

269
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:09,116
Any of those snake things show up here, we make 'em extinct.

270
00:27:09,454 --> 00:27:11,945
-All right! -Burt, get serious.

271
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,283
Yeah! You make it sound like a war.

272
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:17,000
What've you got against being prepared?

273
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:18,001
Rambo.

274
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:22,674
Walter's got a CB radio. Why aren't you calling Bixby? The police--

275
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,970
We can't reach outside the valley because of the mountains.

276
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:29,757
You're next. Sit down, look scared.

277
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:33,555
The phone's out. The road's out. We're on our own.

278
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:36,181
You two are just loving it, aren't you?

279
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:39,525
Nancy, don't get personal about this! We've got to do something.

280
00:27:39,611 --> 00:27:40,776
Hell, yes!

281
00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:43,525
We are completely cut off.

282
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:48,320
We got the cliffs to the north, mountains to the east and the west.

283
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:53,414
That's why Heather and me settled here. Geographic isolation.

284
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:58,090
-There's got to be a way we can get help. -This isn't the moon!

285
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:01,130
What are you going to do, walk the 38 miles to Bixby?

286
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:06,515
There's Walter's saddle horses.

287
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:09,097
That's it. You're welcome to them.

288
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:12,020
Somebody could ride to Bixby.

289
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,314
That's not bad.

290
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,484
Who's best on a horse?

291
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,158
They better be fast.

292
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,659
We don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.

293
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:37,424
-Those snakes couldn't travel that fast. -For all you know they could fly.

294
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:41,211
What do you want? This Colt or Edgar's old rifle?

295
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,219
Rifle.

296
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:51,389
-Here's some Swiss cheese and bullets. -Thanks.

297
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,105
-You guys all set? -Ready as we'll ever be.

298
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:05,156
We're going to find that college girl, tell her to get her ass back into town.

299
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:09,537
Good idea. We'll stop by the doctor's place and see if they went into Bixby.

300
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:10,908
Wait a minute, guys.

301
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:14,089
Take something that packs more of a punch than that .30-.30.

302
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:16,755
Why don't you take one of our Browning autos?

303
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:19,425
Or better than that. Take my Model 70?

304
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:21,927
lt's .375 ''H and H'' mag.

305
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:23,934
Thanks, Heather.

306
00:29:24,602 --> 00:29:26,595
l hope we don't need to use it.

307
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:29,263
lt's got me!

308
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,270
lt's got me!

309
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:36,237
-Grow up! -Damn it!

310
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:40,817
-He's only kidding. -You came that close.

311
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,204
Too close. No more games.

312
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,839
One of these days somebody's going to kick your ass.

313
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:31,338
Doctor?

314
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:52,147
l hate this shit.

315
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:55,238
Wait a minute.

316
00:30:56,828 --> 00:30:59,580
The car's gone. We just missed 'em, that's all.

317
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:04,622
Where's the goddamn golden oldie coming from?

318
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:22,436
-What the hell's this? -You got me.

319
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:36,618
Here's the plan. We don't even stop. We ride like hell.

320
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:40,124
Tonight we'll keep right on going. We'll walk the horses.

321
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,955
That is the plan. What the hell are those things?

322
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:48,382
-How could they bury a station wagon? -Why would they do it?

323
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:54,384
Come on, git!

324
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:58,470
Walter wouldn't know a decent horse if it bit him in the ass.

325
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:01,939
Wait a minute. They got wind of something they don't like.

326
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:08,322
Something's going on.

327
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:10,483
l don't see anything anywhere!

328
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:24,581
-Are you okay? -Yeah. What about my horse?

329
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:28,547
What in the name of--

330
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,934
That's how they get you. They're under the goddamn ground.

331
00:32:38,815 --> 00:32:41,853
-What the hell are they? -Sons of bitches!

332
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,452
Must be a million of 'em!

333
00:32:58,254 --> 00:32:59,878
Nope. Just one.

334
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:06,173
Come on.

335
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:30,121
He's gaining on us!

336
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,537
Look!

337
00:33:36,796 --> 00:33:38,788
We can make it!

338
00:33:50,977 --> 00:33:52,555
Stupid son of a bitch.

339
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:55,307
lt knocked itself cold.

340
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,939
Cold, my ass!

341
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:01,192
He's dead.

342
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:04,904
We killed it.

343
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:08,407
We killed it!

344
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:10,538
Fuck you!

345
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:16,419
Hey, guys. What's going on?

346
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,878
Did you notice anything weird a minute ago?

347
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:21,587
l mean, it just happened--

348
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,715
What's that?

349
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:31,144
All right, together. One, two, three.

350
00:34:36,235 --> 00:34:37,731
Jesus Christ!

351
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:41,111
Does it smell like that 'cause it's dead?

352
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:56,876
l don't see any eyes.

353
00:34:57,675 --> 00:34:59,633
Must be totally subterranean.

354
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,170
And those tentacles.

355
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,977
You know, l think they shoot right out of its mouth...

356
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:13,983
...and they hook you and pull you right in.

357
00:35:14,652 --> 00:35:17,358
Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.

358
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,690
This is important, you know.

359
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,605
This is like...

360
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,363
...well, let's just say it.

361
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,870
This is probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.

362
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,210
Check this out.

363
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,964
l found the ass end.

364
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,918
Jesus, we really caught something here.

365
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,515
-Wow! -Man!

366
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,189
That's one big mother.

367
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:53,443
This must be the old boy had your seismos working overtime.

368
00:35:57,283 --> 00:35:59,609
lt must push itself along with these.

369
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:01,903
All of them pushing at once.

370
00:36:03,582 --> 00:36:05,491
That's why it moved so fast.

371
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:10,123
This thing had sensors tripping all over the place. No--

372
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:12,705
Rhonda, you ever heard of anything like this?

373
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:15,800
Everybody knows about 'em. We just didn't tell you.

374
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:19,050
Hell, man, no one ever saw anything like this!

375
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:20,932
We're really onto something.

376
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:26,143
l'll tell you, old Chang don't get his slick mitts on this for no measly $15.

377
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:27,982
You got that right.

378
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:30,849
All right, here's the plan. We need a flatbed--

379
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:33,352
-Right, with a winch. -A five-ton maybe.

380
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:36,910
No, don't want a winch. lt'd tear it all up.

381
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:39,566
-A crane? -Yeah, a crane with lifting straps.

382
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:40,825
Shut up.

383
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,953
-There are three more of these things. -What?

384
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:47,709
Three more?

385
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:50,964
l've got seismographs all over the valley. Compare the readings.

386
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:52,793
Here's one at 2:00 yesterday.

387
00:36:53,135 --> 00:36:56,255
But here's one three miles away at the exact time. That's two.

388
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,305
-But here-- -We'll take your word.

389
00:36:58,392 --> 00:37:01,144
-Yeah, where's your truck? -Just beyond that hill.

390
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:09,684
What?

391
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:17,905
-Damn prairie dog burrow. -Little sons of bitches.

392
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:31,965
This way!

393
00:37:35,183 --> 00:37:36,558
Up on that rock!

394
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:53,115
Looks like the one that got our truck.

395
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:56,037
-Where the hell's your truck? -Right over there.

396
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:58,739
l don't think we can make that.

397
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:03,623
At least he can't climb.

398
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:12,468
Live ones smell worse than the dead ones.

399
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:33,530
l got it.

400
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,201
They're mutations caused by radiation.

401
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:37,865
Or no.

402
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,710
The government built 'em. Big surprise for the Russians.

403
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:45,506
There's nothing like them in the fossil record. l'm sure.

404
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,509
Okay, so, they predate the fossil record.

405
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:54,727
That would make 'em a couple billion years old.

406
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,427
And we've just never seen one 'til now.

407
00:38:58,148 --> 00:38:59,096
Right.

408
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:02,815
l vote for outer space. No way these are local boys.

409
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:10,409
Well, haven't seen a sign for hours.

410
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:14,205
Must be long gone.

411
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:15,745
Yeah, must be.

412
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:19,873
Why don't you take a little stroll and find out?

413
00:39:23,884 --> 00:39:25,344
We've got to do something.

414
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:37,938
''We've got to do something.''

415
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:41,609
l don't know why ''we'' always has to be ''me'' every damn time.

416
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:46,449
We, we, we. What do l look like? An expert on worms?

417
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:48,942
Watch it, it's got a good six-foot reach.

418
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:50,412
Thank you, Earl.

419
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:56,079
Son of a bitch!

420
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:59,872
Son of a goddamn bitch! Pardon my French.

421
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:05,380
Shit! lt's been waiting here all this time? How's it know we're still here?

422
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:11,390
lt's got no eyes, right? Sure as hell can't smell us underground.

423
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:12,677
lt's been listening.

424
00:40:13,731 --> 00:40:14,845
Of course!

425
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:17,855
lt senses seismic vibration.

426
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:22,149
lt can hear every move we make on this rock. lt's a perfect conductor!

427
00:40:22,531 --> 00:40:25,106
That means we're stuck. That pisses me off!

428
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:38,704
l hate to be crude, but l've got to take care of business.

429
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,507
-Me, too. -Same here.

430
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:11,623
Thanks.

431
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:15,539
No problem. Anytime.

432
00:41:27,646 --> 00:41:29,270
Well, what's the plan?

433
00:41:30,064 --> 00:41:34,144
The first thing we've got to do is see if old Stumpy's still out there.

434
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:38,981
-Can l borrow that shovel? -Yeah.

435
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:50,453
Doesn't he have a home to go to?

436
00:41:50,629 --> 00:41:53,298
That's why Edgar never got down off that damn tower.

437
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:54,579
l have an idea.

438
00:41:54,674 --> 00:41:59,254
You know, we have to come up with a plan or he's going to wait us to death.

439
00:41:59,555 --> 00:42:02,640
-l was thinking-- -Why not run? We outran him yesterday.

440
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:06,806
Run for it? Running's not a plan. Running's what you do when a plan fails.

441
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:08,937
You're not trying to think of a plan.

442
00:42:09,024 --> 00:42:11,479
lt ain't like we got a hell of a lot of options.

443
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:14,688
There's always options. We've just got to think of them.

444
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,524
Why don't you start thinking?

445
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:19,066
Why do l always have to do all the thinking?

446
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,660
-Who died and made you Einstein? -You know how to pole vault?

447
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:30,212
We just stay where he can't get us...

448
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:35,458
...on these residual boulders. My truck's parked next to one.

449
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,067
Stay on those residual boulders!

450
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:56,523
That Tammy Lynn Baxter, she do much pole vaulting?

451
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,095
That's pretty good.

452
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:44,292
That slimebag won't give us much time once we hit that truck.

453
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:46,794
-l say we all jump together. -Right.

454
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:48,413
Wait.

455
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:52,678
Okay, ready.

456
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:56,092
One, two, three!

457
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,818
Go!

458
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:09,895
Watch it, Val!

459
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:15,245
Move!

460
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:29,384
Can somebody, perhaps, help me?

461
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:32,634
No!

462
00:44:32,724 --> 00:44:36,591
The snake things are just their tongues. These animals are huge!

463
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:39,764
l'm sorry. l'm having a real difficult time with this.

464
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:44,019
Come on, you guys, answer.

465
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:46,947
-Where's Burt and Heather? -l can't reach them.

466
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:50,238
l guess they're still driving around.

467
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:53,031
What's the name you call those things?

468
00:44:53,162 --> 00:44:54,905
Where do they come from?

469
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:58,495
-l don't know. -You're a scientist, aren't you?

470
00:44:58,584 --> 00:45:00,577
Aren't you supposed to have a theory?

471
00:45:01,754 --> 00:45:04,163
These creatures are absolutely unprecedented.

472
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:06,543
But where do they come from?

473
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:07,666
Yeah!

474
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,673
lt doesn't matter where they come from.

475
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:14,559
No name.

476
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:17,510
We discovered them, we should name them!

477
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:20,477
Forget the damn name!

478
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:23,894
Now me and Earl need to get out of this valley.

479
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:26,270
Hang on. Let's not go off half-cocked.

480
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:31,028
Somebody's bound to come check on us once they see the road is out...

481
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,872
-...and the lines are down. -That's how it works.

482
00:45:55,063 --> 00:45:59,856
-''Suckoids.'' -''Oids.'' l like ''snakeoids.''

483
00:45:59,944 --> 00:46:03,692
One of them comes near me and l'll hit him with a five-pound pickax.

484
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:07,192
You don't understand. They come up from the ground and grab you.

485
00:46:07,285 --> 00:46:09,954
They sense the slightest vibration through the ground.

486
00:46:10,038 --> 00:46:12,708
Even footsteps. That's how they hunt.

487
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:16,202
So we don't vibrate, right?

488
00:46:16,962 --> 00:46:19,169
Maybe they won't even come through here.

489
00:46:19,548 --> 00:46:21,173
Maybe they'll leave us alone!

490
00:46:21,676 --> 00:46:23,834
Chain saw. That's what l'll use.

491
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:26,169
Wake up!

492
00:46:26,598 --> 00:46:27,925
Now, look!

493
00:46:33,022 --> 00:46:34,978
They're headed right for us!

494
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:38,353
They trapped Edgar here. Grabbed old Fred right here.

495
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:42,277
Nailed those two poor suckers on the road and the doctor's place is here!

496
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:45,695
This valley is just one long smorgasbord.

497
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:49,114
We have got to get out.

498
00:46:52,293 --> 00:46:53,835
l'm going to get Mindy.

499
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,589
She's okay. l saw her playing down the street.

500
00:46:57,048 --> 00:47:00,916
That's what l like, ''Graboids''! That's it, ''graboids''!

501
00:47:01,303 --> 00:47:02,845
Jesus, Walter.

502
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:05,420
We're going to be sorry if we don't give it a name.

503
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:09,634
Okay, you say let's get out of here. Where are we supposed to go?

504
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:13,972
Rhonda's got an idea about that.

505
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:17,769
See, they move very easily through the Pleistocene alluvials.

506
00:47:20,782 --> 00:47:24,282
The dirt. The loose soil that covers the valley floor.

507
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,161
But they can't move through rock.

508
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:29,906
-We should go west to the mountains. -She means up the old Jeep trail.

509
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:32,290
lf those mountains are granite we'd be safe.

510
00:47:32,378 --> 00:47:34,786
We could hike along them to Bixby if we--

511
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:39,711
l scared you, didn't l?

512
00:47:41,347 --> 00:47:42,971
You little ass wipe.

513
00:47:43,056 --> 00:47:46,757
You don't knock it off, you're going to be shitting this basketball.

514
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,605
Pardon my French.

515
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:03,744
lt's going to take us days to get back with help with Nestor.

516
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:06,071
We're not going to leave you alone.

517
00:48:10,295 --> 00:48:13,415
-Damn it! l'm going to kick his ass! -l'm going to help you.

518
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,093
Where is that little shit stain?

519
00:48:25,312 --> 00:48:27,019
Melvin, get your--

520
00:48:30,566 --> 00:48:31,731
Get inside!

521
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:49,044
-Run! Come on! -Come on, get in!

522
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:53,836
-Walter, you got a gun? -No!

523
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:57,090
-What are we going to do? -Be quiet!

524
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:00,595
Where is he?

525
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:25,039
Now remember, no noise, no vibrations.

526
00:49:35,221 --> 00:49:37,013
No, Mindy.

527
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,297
Stop.

528
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:40,349
Mindy, get off the pogo stick.

529
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,309
-Get her, Val! -Mindy, come back!

530
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,124
Be quiet. Don't move.

531
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:07,038
Mindy, get back.

532
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:10,339
Run! Get in the house!

533
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,852
Get him off or it'll suck that truck down.

534
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,518
Go back, for Chrissake!

535
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:29,946
Jesus, here comes another one!

536
00:50:31,992 --> 00:50:33,818
Run! Come on!

537
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:31,765
Get out of your pants!

538
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:39,685
Look out!

539
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:53,699
Run!

540
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,154
Don't look back. Come on!

541
00:52:17,224 --> 00:52:18,092
Sorry.

542
00:52:41,073 --> 00:52:43,952
-Rhonda, here. -Thank you.

543
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:49,652
What are we going to do? How long 'til they go away?

544
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:52,541
They got the patience of Job.

545
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:57,262
They sit and wait until they hear something that sounds like lunch.

546
00:52:57,484 --> 00:53:00,243
-We've got to have a plan. -l got a plan.

547
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:04,879
You drive the truck up to the mountain, walk to Bixby, get some help.

548
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:09,156
-Those scumsuckers ate our radials. -You can take my truck.

549
00:53:09,743 --> 00:53:13,668
No, we need a major four-wheel drive just to get up that Jeep trail.

550
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:16,261
That trail's all messed up.

551
00:53:19,617 --> 00:53:21,365
Turn it off!

552
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:23,998
Pull it back!

553
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:31,200
l got it.

554
00:53:43,048 --> 00:53:44,760
Give me your hand!

555
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,049
Son of a bitch.

556
00:53:59,474 --> 00:54:01,021
Son of a bitch!

557
00:54:16,665 --> 00:54:19,201
Come on, let's go! The roof!

558
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:40,597
Come on!

559
00:54:45,807 --> 00:54:49,105
-Jump! You can do it! -l can't!

560
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:57,739
Don't stop. Keep moving!

561
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:03,578
Oh, my God.

562
00:55:10,451 --> 00:55:12,170
You okay?

563
00:55:14,888 --> 00:55:17,843
What's going on? Where are you guys?

564
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:21,114
What's up? What the hell are you doing up there?

565
00:55:21,164 --> 00:55:23,205
Shut the hell up.

566
00:55:23,255 --> 00:55:25,684
-Get up on your roof. -No way!

567
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,408
Nancy, get up on your roofs.

568
00:55:50,534 --> 00:55:53,830
Up on your roofs! They come through the floor.

569
00:56:05,723 --> 00:56:08,138
l don't know. l can't believe it.

570
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:10,527
No tracks.

571
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:13,661
No sign. No spoor.

572
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,681
You'd think after eating all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace.

573
00:56:18,777 --> 00:56:20,905
Yeah. l don't understand it.

574
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,258
<i>Walter, this is Burt. Come back</i>.

575
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:49,440
<i>Walter? Anybody copy?</i>

576
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,660
<i>l'm waiting</i>.

577
00:56:53,129 --> 00:56:56,304
<i>-Walter, you there? Come back!</i> -Okay, l got it.

578
00:57:05,931 --> 00:57:08,346
<i>Who's minding the store, for God's sake?</i>

579
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:12,445
Burt, listen. We found out what's been killing people.

580
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:14,630
-Say ''over.'' -Over.

581
00:57:14,843 --> 00:57:18,389
Negative copy on that, Walter. Check your frequency.

582
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:21,736
l'm on 22. Come back.

583
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:24,717
<i>Burt, can you hear me now? Over</i>.

584
00:57:24,969 --> 00:57:27,181
ls that you? What're you doing back already?

585
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,483
Something real weird's going on over there.

586
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,200
They're up on top of the roof.

587
00:57:46,395 --> 00:57:50,829
l think they're going for Burt's.

588
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:56,293
Man! They're going!

589
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:59,647
Burt, get out of your basement. Take your radio.

590
00:57:59,697 --> 00:58:03,413
You and Heather get up on your roof. We'll talk later. Over.

591
00:58:03,463 --> 00:58:05,882
Up on the roof? What are you talking about?

592
00:58:05,932 --> 00:58:09,264
Damn it, Burt. Listen to him. Something's wrong.

593
00:58:09,446 --> 00:58:11,112
<i>Burt, Jesus Christ!</i>

594
00:58:11,162 --> 00:58:13,162
Get up on your roof! The things!

595
00:58:13,212 --> 00:58:16,132
<i>They're under the ground</i>. <i>They're bigger than we thought</i>.

596
00:58:16,182 --> 00:58:20,275
<i>They're huge. They're coming after you</i>. <i>They're coming right now!</i>

597
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:41,171
We don't see anything. What the hell are you talking about? Over.

598
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:44,251
They're under the ground!

599
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:48,099
<i>They can dig. Big monsters!</i> <i>Underground! Now get out!</i>

600
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,930
<i>Hurry!</i>

601
00:59:10,784 --> 00:59:12,117
<i>Jesus--</i>

602
00:59:50,912 --> 00:59:52,411


603
00:59:52,492 --> 00:59:53,994
Burt, come on.

604
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:03,080


605
01:00:03,378 --> 01:00:04,629
Magazine!

606
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:28,530
Here!

607
01:01:14,556 --> 01:01:18,816
Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room, didn't you, you bastard?

608
01:01:20,747 --> 01:01:24,675
<i>We killed it! You got that?</i> <i>We killed that motherhumper! Come back</i>.

609
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:29,322
Roger that, Burt. And congratulations.

610
01:01:29,408 --> 01:01:33,585
Be advised, however, there are two more. Repeat, two more motherhumpers.

611
01:01:46,354 --> 01:01:48,066
Burt got one! He killed one!

612
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:51,873
-Way to go, dude! -All right!

613
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:00,654
l guess we don't get to make fun of Burt's lifestyle anymore.

614
01:02:00,914 --> 01:02:01,865
Say, Burt?

615
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,884
<i>Any chance you can get the other two?</i> <i>Come back</i>.

616
01:02:06,062 --> 01:02:07,810
One second, pal.

617
01:02:16,855 --> 01:02:19,652
You didn't get penetration even with the elephant gun.

618
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:22,874
Good Lord!

619
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:31,034
<i>We can't get 'em</i>.

620
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,874
<i>l never figured</i> <i>on having to shoot through dirt</i>.

621
01:02:33,969 --> 01:02:36,848
<i>The best goddamn bullet stop there is</i>. <i>Come back</i>.

622
01:02:38,697 --> 01:02:39,944
Let me see that.

623
01:02:41,196 --> 01:02:44,487
Forget shooting them. Can you get to your truck?

624
01:02:44,832 --> 01:02:46,032
<i>-Over</i>. -No problem.

625
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:48,968
<i>You have the only truck</i> <i>that can get up that Jeep trail</i>.

626
01:02:49,304 --> 01:02:51,014
Now listen. Here's the plan.

627
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:54,024
You and Heather go for help. You get to the mountains and--

628
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,904
You guys!

629
01:02:57,078 --> 01:02:58,788
-Come over. -Hang on a sec.

630
01:03:00,504 --> 01:03:04,092
-He's up to something. -lf it isn't our old pal Stumpy.

631
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:05,716
Bastard.

632
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:16,414
What do you think it's trying to do?

633
01:03:16,968 --> 01:03:18,880
Why do you keep asking me?

634
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:45,927
What the hell was that?

635
01:03:46,931 --> 01:03:49,890
<i>Breaker there, Earl</i>. <i>What did you want us to do?</i>

636
01:03:50,024 --> 01:03:51,057
<i>Come back</i>.

637
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,239
Hang on, Burt. This bastard's trying something new.

638
01:03:56,627 --> 01:03:57,493
Over.

639
01:04:13,845 --> 01:04:17,849
They wasn't making no noise. Why is he bothering them?

640
01:04:18,065 --> 01:04:21,237
lt's like it's studying the buildings, trying to figure them out.

641
01:04:21,618 --> 01:04:24,742
They can feel our vibrations but they can't find us.

642
01:04:24,919 --> 01:04:27,414
Looks to me like they're coming up with a plan.

643
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:36,194
Watch it, Nestor!

644
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:50,408
Shit! Enough!

645
01:04:57,432 --> 01:05:01,651
-Get off the ground! Get moving! -Get out of there!

646
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:03,772
Move it!

647
01:05:05,204 --> 01:05:08,377
No, that's no good! You've got to get higher!

648
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:21,702
No way!

649
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:25,383
No! You guys have got to do something!

650
01:05:26,726 --> 01:05:28,972
You've got to do something!

651
01:05:32,953 --> 01:05:35,283
<i>Burt? Heather?</i>

652
01:05:38,093 --> 01:05:40,256
You got us. Come on back. Over.

653
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:44,357
<i>We're in deep shit over here</i>. <i>We'll have to change that plan</i>.

654
01:05:47,162 --> 01:05:49,658
-Burt, cut it out! -l think l scared him.

655
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:51,507
<i>No use going for help</i>.

656
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:54,797
<i>We'd be dead</i> <i>long before you'd ever get back</i>.

657
01:05:55,479 --> 01:05:57,891
<i>We're with you</i>. <i>Tell us what you want to do</i>.

658
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:01,410
This one's going to tear this town out from under us.

659
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:03,835
We're going to have to get out of here together...

660
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:05,724
-...<i>now</i>. -Okay.

661
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:08,851
We're coming after everybody. Just hang tight. Over.

662
01:06:34,352 --> 01:06:36,645
<i>You're going to have to</i> <i>forget about the truck</i>.

663
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,772
Yeah, we've got you, Heather.

664
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:43,997
The situation hasn't changed.

665
01:06:44,173 --> 01:06:47,547
We still have to make it to solid rock. There's got to be a way.

666
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:51,806
Like what? There's nothing left that can make it to those mountains.

667
01:06:54,703 --> 01:06:56,285
Quiet, man.

668
01:06:56,877 --> 01:06:59,207
lt doesn't matter now. They know we're here.

669
01:07:00,053 --> 01:07:03,510
We need a helicopter. Or a goddamn tank!

670
01:07:03,856 --> 01:07:07,314
Wait a minute. The Cat!

671
01:07:07,616 --> 01:07:10,907
-Could we take the Cat? -Jesus. lt's slower than hell.

672
01:07:11,378 --> 01:07:14,526
But it weighs more than 30 tons. There's no way they could lift that.

673
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:18,449
-Could they? l mean-- -But we can't all fit on the bulldozer.

674
01:07:22,724 --> 01:07:24,471
No, but we could...

675
01:07:24,856 --> 01:07:29,325
...drag something, though. We could pull a car behind it. l don't know.

676
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,372
Hell, that old semitrailer.

677
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:35,127
-lts tires are flat. -Doesn't matter.

678
01:07:35,262 --> 01:07:37,174
That Cat can pull anything.

679
01:07:39,148 --> 01:07:42,358
-We just roll on out of here. -We've got a plan!

680
01:07:47,423 --> 01:07:50,263
Of course, that's a hell of a long walk.

681
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,014
They only respond to vibration, right?

682
01:07:54,193 --> 01:07:56,770
Couldn't we distract them somehow?

683
01:07:58,331 --> 01:08:01,920
Good. Something to keep 'em busy. Like a decoy.

684
01:08:03,386 --> 01:08:05,717
Melvin, you want to make a buck?

685
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:07,622
Eat it!

686
01:08:07,711 --> 01:08:11,466
How about Walter's little tractor? Start him up.

687
01:08:11,973 --> 01:08:13,684
Let him go out by himself.

688
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:16,942
Let those things follow him all over if they like that noise.

689
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,362
Not bad. What do you think?

690
01:08:33,412 --> 01:08:36,752
Ground's getting closer. l say we go with Miguel's plan.

691
01:09:04,502 --> 01:09:05,917
Hold on, Nancy!

692
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:08,302
-l'm making the run for the Cat. -Like hell.

693
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,146
-l'm faster than you. -But l'm best at driving the Cat.

694
01:09:11,232 --> 01:09:15,153
-Not while l'm around. -Listen to me. l'm older and wiser.

695
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:17,122
Well you're half right.

696
01:09:20,425 --> 01:09:23,765
Damn! l lost. Guess l'll have to do it.

697
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:25,543
l won. l pick who does it.

698
01:09:26,508 --> 01:09:28,134
Ready when you are, Miguel.

699
01:09:43,474 --> 01:09:46,053
There he is. There he goes!

700
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,397
He's chasing it!

701
01:09:52,959 --> 01:09:56,049
lt's going. This one's going, too!

702
01:09:57,642 --> 01:10:00,932
-Good luck, shithead. -Don't worry about me, jerk-off.

703
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,730
You suicidal son of a bitch.

704
01:10:30,737 --> 01:10:32,021
Keep going!

705
01:10:40,309 --> 01:10:41,854
Oh, my God.

706
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:46,279
Come on!

707
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:50,211
They're going to get him!

708
01:10:52,011 --> 01:10:54,737
Val, stop! They're coming! Be quiet!

709
01:10:54,787 --> 01:10:55,989
Don't move!

710
01:11:06,783 --> 01:11:09,457
lt worked. They can't find him.

711
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:18,560
We've got to...

712
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:21,699
...make some noise.

713
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:23,574
A lot of noise!

714
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:27,674
You sorry sons of bitches. Come and get my ass!

715
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:31,432
Over here, you slime bucket! Come get me!

716
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:44,509
What are you, scared? Come on.

717
01:11:57,057 --> 01:11:58,257
What's she doing?

718
01:12:11,683 --> 01:12:14,724
That did it, girl! Goddamn good thinking.

719
01:13:41,322 --> 01:13:42,903
-You okay? -Yeah.

720
01:13:48,468 --> 01:13:49,382
Here goes.

721
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:01,183
-Here. -Yeah.

722
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,667
Goddamn! Armored transport.

723
01:14:25,934 --> 01:14:27,931
Let's get going!

724
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:33,286
Come on, let's go, you two. We're headed for the mountains.

725
01:14:33,456 --> 01:14:36,035
lf that's how we're doing it, we're going prepared.

726
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:39,548
We can't hold still long. These things are damn smart.

727
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,220
-They're getting smarter by the minute. -Fine.

728
01:14:42,609 --> 01:14:44,688
We've got some new things to teach 'em.

729
01:14:58,531 --> 01:14:59,778
You see that?

730
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:03,500
They're doing it again. They try it every time we stop!

731
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:07,968
Jesus Christ! We're only going nine miles.

732
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:11,560
Those things will be on our ass every foot of the way, right?

733
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:15,032
-Just hurry! -What are you doing up there?

734
01:15:15,122 --> 01:15:17,700
-Can't you see we are sinking. -Get in the trailer!

735
01:15:17,797 --> 01:15:20,374
What do you think? Max firepower or this?

736
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:24,725
l go for penetration. The .458, shooting solids. Less ammo to carry.

737
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:26,564
Come on. Move it!

738
01:15:27,575 --> 01:15:29,321
Watch these ammo boxes!

739
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:32,327
-Come on, Burt! -Heather, hurry!

740
01:15:32,882 --> 01:15:35,009
-Tell 'em to come on! -Okay, now!

741
01:15:35,263 --> 01:15:37,224
Now! Come on!

742
01:15:43,246 --> 01:15:44,873
Give me a gun. l'll take one.

743
01:15:44,959 --> 01:15:48,049
l wouldn't give you a gun if it was World War lll.

744
01:16:06,857 --> 01:16:09,435
Food for five years.

745
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:14,482
1,000 gallons of gas, air and water filtration, Geiger counter...

746
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,523
...bomb shelter.

747
01:16:19,498 --> 01:16:22,671
Underground. Goddamn monsters!

748
01:16:35,755 --> 01:16:38,465
There we go! Fallen Rock.

749
01:16:46,203 --> 01:16:47,783
Any sign of them?

750
01:16:48,668 --> 01:16:50,915
Maybe they just gave up, you know?

751
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:55,593
What's that?

752
01:16:57,736 --> 01:17:00,315
Damn it! What the hell are they doing?

753
01:17:00,411 --> 01:17:04,748
l don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.

754
01:17:11,569 --> 01:17:13,280
Wait! Look out!

755
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,513
-Burt, you okay? -l'm okay.

756
01:17:23,604 --> 01:17:25,731
Are they going to get us? What happened?

757
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,355
-Burt, you sure you're okay? -Yeah.

758
01:17:31,984 --> 01:17:33,444
What happened?

759
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:35,946
They dug a trap.

760
01:17:36,454 --> 01:17:37,951
l can't believe this.

761
01:17:39,965 --> 01:17:41,247
All right.

762
01:17:42,138 --> 01:17:43,088
Here.

763
01:17:56,723 --> 01:17:58,053
Let me have my gun.

764
01:18:02,825 --> 01:18:05,285
Hungry? Eat this!

765
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:07,628
Everybody down!

766
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:18,155
There they are!

767
01:18:18,914 --> 01:18:20,802
-Did you kill one? -l don't know.

768
01:18:20,852 --> 01:18:22,476
No, there's still two of them.

769
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:25,778
-There're two different dust trails. -Made them think twice.

770
01:18:25,872 --> 01:18:27,202
What's in those?

771
01:18:27,294 --> 01:18:29,919
A few household chemicals in the proper proportion.

772
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:37,355
Here they come. They're coming back!

773
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,391
We'll have to make a run for those rocks.

774
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:50,770
-l don't know. That's a long way. -They'll get us!

775
01:18:50,863 --> 01:18:53,488
They're going to get us if we stay here.

776
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:57,458
-You have any more of those bombs? -We've got you covered.

777
01:18:57,550 --> 01:19:01,805
What if we throw one that way, the way we want to go? Then when it explodes...

778
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:05,109
...if it drives them away, we run like goddamn bastards.

779
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,147
Pardon my French.

780
01:19:08,853 --> 01:19:11,693
What if they don't get scared? What if they don't run?

781
01:19:12,405 --> 01:19:14,901
l don't think it does scare them. lt hurts them.

782
01:19:14,996 --> 01:19:17,207
They're sensitive to sound, they'll run.

783
01:19:17,295 --> 01:19:18,957
Hell, she's got my vote!

784
01:19:19,093 --> 01:19:21,718
That's it! We're making a run for it!

785
01:19:21,809 --> 01:19:24,981
-We're going for the rocks. -l don't know. They're too fast.

786
01:19:25,068 --> 01:19:29,654
-You can't out run 'em. No way! -This'll make 'em think twice.

787
01:19:29,749 --> 01:19:32,922
Everybody ready to run?

788
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,486
Heads down!

789
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:50,891
lt worked! There they go!

790
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:52,351
Let's go!

791
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,003
Come on, Burt.

792
01:20:04,957 --> 01:20:06,957
You asshole!

793
01:20:12,587 --> 01:20:13,835
Get up.

794
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:24,409
-Get up here! -l'm with you, honey.

795
01:20:25,248 --> 01:20:26,876
Go!

796
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:36,732
You asshole! There are no bullets in this gun.

797
01:20:37,495 --> 01:20:39,288
Got you moving, didn't it?

798
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,416
So now what?

799
01:21:11,385 --> 01:21:14,677
Could we make it to the mountains? Use Burt's explosives?

800
01:21:14,897 --> 01:21:16,060
No way.

801
01:21:16,734 --> 01:21:18,529
We'd need 50 of those bombs.

802
01:21:19,117 --> 01:21:20,232
That's it.

803
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:23,127
We're not getting off this rock.

804
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:29,120
We're not going to pole vault out of here. That's for damn sure.

805
01:21:29,837 --> 01:21:32,962
Wait a minute. What're you talking about?

806
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,302
lt's like you're giving up.

807
01:21:35,394 --> 01:21:39,649
They'll wait out there 'til we're dead. That's exactly what they do.

808
01:21:41,202 --> 01:21:42,283
Wait!

809
01:21:43,376 --> 01:21:47,881
For Chrissake, we could've made a stand at our place. We had food, water....

810
01:21:48,224 --> 01:21:49,886
You can't fight 'em like that.

811
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:53,021
So you two screw-ups hauled us way the hell out here?

812
01:21:57,919 --> 01:22:02,471
Why don't you just back off, string bean? We could've left your ass on the roof!

813
01:22:02,559 --> 01:22:05,766
l wish you had, fearless leader. Who put you two in charge?

814
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:08,105
Don't push me!

815
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,362
lf them graboids don't kill him, l will.

816
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:14,706
What?

817
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:18,293
They'd have torn up your place in half an hour.

818
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:21,810
Come on. Just let it go. Forget about it.

819
01:22:23,234 --> 01:22:25,862
l know he does. He thinks he knows everything.

820
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:41,075
lf it comes to starvation, l know what l'm doing.

821
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:44,253
Take one of these...

822
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:49,555
...walk right out there with the fuse lit and let 'em take me down.

823
01:22:55,748 --> 01:22:57,375
Good Lord, honey.

824
01:22:59,258 --> 01:23:00,921
Now that's not a bad idea.

825
01:23:02,476 --> 01:23:04,438
No. lt gives me an idea.

826
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:06,267
Going fishing.

827
01:23:11,108 --> 01:23:13,317
There's one. Straight out in front.

828
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,992
Let's see if we can keep him right there.

829
01:23:16,247 --> 01:23:19,170
-How much we need? -l don't know. They're pretty quick.

830
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:20,878
Fifteen seconds at least.

831
01:23:23,352 --> 01:23:26,027
-Which kind of fuse is that? -Cannon fuse.

832
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:29,069
-What the hell you use if for? -My cannon.

833
01:23:29,536 --> 01:23:31,616
You guys watch yourselves.

834
01:23:34,846 --> 01:23:36,888
Right out there, about 30--

835
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:41,313
-You're not going do your lasso thing? -Just 'cause you're no good with a rope.

836
01:23:46,252 --> 01:23:47,748
All right, get back!

837
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:58,820
Come on, baby.

838
01:23:59,745 --> 01:24:01,504
Take it. Take the bait!

839
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:08,490
Yeah! All right!

840
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:14,850
Look at it!

841
01:24:35,188 --> 01:24:36,233
Okay, one to go.

842
01:24:38,463 --> 01:24:39,671
Damn! Where the hell is he?

843
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:42,732
Hope he didn't wise up.

844
01:24:46,282 --> 01:24:46,781
There.

845
01:24:48,697 --> 01:24:49,974
Look who it is.

846
01:24:51,013 --> 01:24:51,961
Give me that thing.

847
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:54,146
This son of a bitch is mine.

848
01:24:58,438 --> 01:24:58,934
There it goes!

849
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:01,474
-All right, get back! -l got it.

850
01:25:02,396 --> 01:25:02,905
Come on.

851
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:18,605
Come on. Lunchtime, slophead.

852
01:25:21,702 --> 01:25:23,246
All right, get down!

853
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:32,308
Oh, my God! lt's coming--

854
01:25:32,442 --> 01:25:34,068
Get back! Run!

855
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:36,992
Get up, come on!

856
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:55,167
What're you doing out there?

857
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:14,219
Okay, let's make some noise. Try to distract them.

858
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:30,775
Fresh meat!

859
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:46,314
Wait.

860
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:51,211
This one's not falling for it.

861
01:26:53,221 --> 01:26:54,849
This one ain't dumb.

862
01:26:56,062 --> 01:26:57,809
He's trying to trick us.

863
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:01,447
Use your bomb.

864
01:27:02,081 --> 01:27:04,125
lt's our last one.

865
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,030
What else you going use it for?

866
01:27:08,538 --> 01:27:12,674
So what if we make it to the rocks. We'll be dead in three days anyway.

867
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,341
l want to live for the three days.

868
01:27:15,558 --> 01:27:17,354
What the hell? What's the matter?

869
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:20,695
-Use the bomb, for God's sake! -Throw that bomb, man!

870
01:27:21,034 --> 01:27:22,946
Scare 'em away!

871
01:27:23,749 --> 01:27:25,496
Throw the bomb!

872
01:27:29,182 --> 01:27:31,393
This bastard ain't smarter than us.

873
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:34,731
For Chrissake, Val!

874
01:27:34,867 --> 01:27:37,278
-l'm going to go for it. -Go for what?

875
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:52,748
-What are you doing? -l got a goddamn plan!

876
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,217
Where the hell is it?

877
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,942
l've got it!

878
01:28:08,424 --> 01:28:10,967
This better be one hell of a great plan!

879
01:28:18,663 --> 01:28:19,743
Get ready!

880
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:22,706
-Light it, man! -Not yet.

881
01:28:23,384 --> 01:28:24,761
What are you waiting for?

882
01:28:26,268 --> 01:28:27,384
Go!

883
01:28:28,649 --> 01:28:29,980
Come on!

884
01:28:32,453 --> 01:28:34,663
Too far! You threw it behind him.

885
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:43,521
Run!

886
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:53,254
Can you fly, you sucker?

887
01:29:23,478 --> 01:29:26,269
lt just suddenly hit me, you know.

888
01:29:26,907 --> 01:29:27,875
Stampede.

889
01:29:45,419 --> 01:29:46,499
Now...

890
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:50,179
...the second we hit Bixby, we start making phone calls.

891
01:29:50,307 --> 01:29:52,935
We could make some real money on this thing.

892
01:29:53,024 --> 01:29:55,401
We could get in <i>People</i> magazine.

893
01:29:55,657 --> 01:29:58,449
<i>People</i>? Hell! National Geographic.

894
01:30:03,722 --> 01:30:04,719
Smile.

895
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,508
Burt loaned me his camera.

896
01:30:18,767 --> 01:30:21,013
Yeah. He gave us these tires, too.

897
01:30:26,289 --> 01:30:28,202
lt's all pretty exciting, huh?

898
01:30:29,298 --> 01:30:32,508
There's going to be research, and l'm going to be in on it.

899
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:37,212
The first thing to do is take pictures of that one we dug up.

900
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:42,094
Yeah. Pictures seem like a good idea.

901
01:30:45,158 --> 01:30:48,329
Thanks for everything. Saving my life and stuff.

902
01:30:51,676 --> 01:30:53,174
You're welcome.

903
01:30:55,187 --> 01:30:57,064
Maybe l'll see you sometime?

904
01:31:10,357 --> 01:31:11,438
See ya.

905
01:31:17,545 --> 01:31:20,801
l know! l'm working up to it.

906
01:31:21,515 --> 01:31:22,845
What am l doing?

907
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:26,061
What's a woman like her want with a guy like me?

908
01:31:26,153 --> 01:31:28,150
She's going for her damn Ph.D.

909
01:31:33,341 --> 01:31:34,339
Yeah?

910
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,443
l just wanted to....
