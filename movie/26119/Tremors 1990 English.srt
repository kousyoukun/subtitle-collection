1
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,227
Good morning, Mr. Basset.
This is your wake-up call.

2
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,021
Please move your ass.

3
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,579
Stampede!

4
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,291
Stampede, Earl!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

5
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,297
You dumb shit.

6
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,635
I was in a stampede once.

7
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,306
Three hundred head
going hell-bent for the horizon.

8
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,602
Now, exactly how many cows
are required for a stampede, Earl?

9
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:47,106
I mean, is it like three or more?
Is there a minimum speed?

10
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,191
I wish a stampede up your ass.

11
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,600
No breakfast?

12
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,562
I did it yesterday. It was bologna and beans.

13
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,773
No. It was eggs.

14
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,568
I did eggs, over easy.

15
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,572
The hell you did.
Bologna and beans. It's your turn.

16
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:49,168
Well, I guess when I'm your age,
I'll forget what I eat, too.

17
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,384
Oh, God damn it!

18
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,471
I ask you, is this a job for intelligent men?

19
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,307
Show me one. I'll ask him.

20
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,644
I mean, if we were real serious about money,
we'd quit being hired hands...

21
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,731
Handymen, Earl. We are handymen.

22
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:15,694
Yeah, yeah. We should quit this job and
find ourselves some real employment.

23
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,363
Are you gonna give up
all this personal freedom?

24
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,740
I don't know.

25
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,214
Freeway!

26
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,799
So, what's on the agenda for today?

27
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,678
- It's garbage day.
- Oh, man! Already?

28
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,972
Hey, what's Nestor paying us?

29
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,809
50 bucks.
And that's 47 bucks more than we got.

30
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,728
Burt and Heather's place is closer.

31
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,232
Let's do their linoleum today
and do the garbage tomorrow.

32
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,566
Nestor's not home tomorrow.

33
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,693
Now, look, we don't dig today,
we don't get paid today.

34
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,279
Now, damn it, Valentine,
you never plan ahead.

35
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,405
You never take the long view.

36
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,034
I mean, here it is Monday,
and I'm already thinking of Wednesday.

37
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,995
It is Monday, right?

38
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,500
Hey, who the hell's that?

39
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,418
That's not what's-his-name,
the grad student?

40
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,922
- No. He graduated. Must be the new one.
- The new one?

41
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,384
That's supposed to be a girl.

42
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,936
You will have long, blonde hair,

43
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,106
big, green eyes, world-class breasts,

44
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,485
ass that won't quit
and legs that go all the way up!

45
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:52,457
Hi! I'm Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck.
I'm up here for the semester.

46
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,626
- Yeah, geography.
- Geology.

47
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,547
Yeah, well, actually seismology.
Earthquakes.

48
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,882
And you two must be Val and Earl.

49
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,635
- I've heard all about you.
- We deny everything.

50
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,597
Hey, listen, I've got a question for you.

51
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,642
Do you know if anybody's
doing any drilling or blasting

52
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,311
or anything like that?

53
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,148
Around here? No, ma'am.

54
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,068
Well, I'm supposed to monitor
the seismographs.

55
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,655
You know, they measure vibrations.

56
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,824
Vibrations in the ground.

57
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,034
Yeah.

58
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,829
Well, I've been getting
some really strange readings.

59
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,081
I mean, the school's had these machines
up here for three years,

60
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,167
and we've never recorded anything like this.

61
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,837
Well, we'll ask around.
You know, see if anyone's heard anything.

62
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,839
Thanks.

63
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,093
God, I hope they're not broken.
I might have to bag the whole semester.

64
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,221
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

65
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,931
No problem.

66
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,601
Nice meeting you.
Hope you get it all sorted out.

67
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,453
You know, if you wanted,
we could take a look at those

68
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,790
seismographs for her if you want.

69
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,376
What the hell do we know
about seismographs?

70
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,919
Nothing.

71
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,921
It sure might be a slick way
to get to know her.

72
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,130
Why?

73
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,383
Damn it, Valentine.

74
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,178
You don't go for any gal unless she fits
that stupid list of yours from top to bottom.

75
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,806
- Well, sure!
- Yeah, and it's dumber than my hind end.

76
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,142
I mean, like that Bobby Lynn Dexter.

77
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,728
Tammy Lynn Baxter.

78
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,065
It don't matter.
They're all the same, dead weight.

79
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,900
"Ooh! I broke a nail!"

80
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,028
Makes my skin crawl.

81
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,697
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.

82
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,535
I thought you call it your pecker.

83
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,277
Hey, pizza face!

84
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,154
Melvin?

85
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,031
Melvin! You touch that truck and die.

86
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,660
Oh, man, I'm really shaking.

87
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,622
Thanks, Walter.

88
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,542
Look, these are hollow points,
but they're not Hydrashok hollow points.

89
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,043
Excuse me, I thought bullets were bullets.

90
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,462
Hi, guys. What you been doing?

91
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,840
We ran into that new college student,
that Rona.

92
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,260
Rhonda. Yeah, she's having trouble
with her, uh,

93
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,138
uh, things.

94
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:58,143
You know, those college kids turn up
oil or uranium or something out there.

95
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:04,024
Next thing the feds will be at our door.
"Sorry. Time to move. Eminent domain. "

96
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,525
Down, honey. Down.

97
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,278
Yeah, Burt. The way you worry,

98
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,948
you'll have a heart attack before you get
a chance to survive World War lll.

99
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,492
We'll see. We'll see.

100
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,164
Hey, guys, listen. Bearing going out.

101
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,916
- What do you think?
- Could be.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,668
Catch you later, Chang.
We got a schedule to keep.

103
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,296
Oh, yeah. See, we plan ahead.

104
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,257
That way we don't do anything right now.
Earl explained it to me.

105
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,534
Cocktail?

106
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,910
You bet.

107
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,752
Well, I'll tell you.

108
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,047
Nobody handles garbage better than we do.

109
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,214
Yep.

110
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,553
Oh, come on, Earl. Now this is low.

111
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,057
We have got to set our sights
a little bit higher.

112
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,816
Hey, Melvin, why don't you give us a hand?
Most of this shit is yours anyway.

113
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,654
Listen, run down to the store
and pick me up a six-pack. I'll pay for it.

114
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,114
Son, beer is for adults.

115
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,620
You know, not having a plan
is what keeps us doing jobs like this.

116
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:07,165
Just doing jobs like this
is you dragging your feet.

117
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,668
Are you gonna stand there and tell me,
in broad daylight,

118
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,670
that I'm the reason we're still in Perfection?

119
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,381
You know how close I am
to leaving this place right now?

120
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,008
I'll call that little bluff. How close?

121
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,512
- Shit!
- God damn!

122
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,934
Jesus Christ! God damn!

123
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,355
Don't forget the TV.

124
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,940
Hey, what's that
vacuum cleaner for, man?

125
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,358
I like this vacuum cleaner.

126
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,403
- Hell, you never use it.
- Well, it's good for parts.

127
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,700
And, besides, maybe we'll hire a maid.
Now had you thought about that, Earl?

128
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,201
Get in the truck.

129
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,503
Guys!

130
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,799
Hey, guys, wait!

131
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,345
Hi.

132
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,515
Sorry, Nancy.
We're not delivering firewood anymore.

133
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,184
- We're heading for Bixby permanent.
- Oh, sure.

134
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,479
Oh, my God. You really are!

135
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,567
Hey, Mindy, what's the count?

136
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,902
Six hundred and forty.

137
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,654
Guys, look, I don't need firewood.

138
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,408
I have this big order to fill,
and I have to build my new pottery kiln.

139
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,745
Come on, it'll be at least a month's work.

140
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,621
I'll throw in lunches.

141
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,082
And beer.

142
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,841
I can't believe
we said no to free beer.

143
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,387
We did it! We did it!
We faced temptation and did not bend!

144
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,264
God damn! Praise the Lord!

145
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,102
Now there's nothing, and I mean nothing,
between us and Bixby but nothing!

146
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,688
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

147
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,526
Hey, look at that guy!

148
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,780
Oh, that's one job I'd never do.
Working around electricity.

149
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,032
Hey, hold up.

150
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,658
That's Edgar Deems.

151
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,702
Come on.

152
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,371
No. He only wears that one damn jacket.

153
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,373
That's him, I'm telling you.

154
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,765
Man, oh, man,
he sure must've been drunk this time.

155
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,184
Edgar, get your butt down from there!

156
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,984
Well, shit.

157
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,736
We can't leave him up there.

158
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,122
Thank you, Edgar.

159
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,587
You owe me on this one,
you damned old boozehound.

160
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,014
One of these days, you're gonna have to
get your ass on a wagon and stay there.

161
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,725
Jesus! It's not like
I don't have better things to do

162
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,729
than to climb towers
and drag your hairy ass down.

163
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,275
Jesus Christ!

164
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,993
Was it a heart attack, Doctor?

165
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,037
No.

166
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,666
He died of dehydration. Thirst.

167
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,336
Well, that doesn't make any sense.
That takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

168
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,213
Maybe even three or four.

169
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,092
You mean he sat up there
three or four days?

170
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,553
He sat up there and just died of thirst?

171
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,197
Hmm.

172
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,543
You reckon he hated Perfection
more than us?

173
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,129
Do you suppose he wanted to kill himself?

174
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,091
Come on.
Somebody must've chased him up there.

175
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,552
What, you mean someone
who ain't scared of a Winchester rifle?

176
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,721
Then what'd they do?

177
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,891
Camp out down below
and just wait for him to die?

178
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,061
What the hell?

179
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,745
What the shit?

180
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,165
Hey, Fred!

181
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,293
Hey, there, old Fred!

182
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,130
Hey, Fred!

183
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,218
Fred!

184
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,232
This is weird.
This is real weird.

185
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,738
Jesus!

186
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,531
What the hell's going on?

187
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,950
I mean, what the hell is going on?

188
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,796
Everybody get the hell out of here!
There's a killer on the loose!

189
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,882
- What?
- A murderer, man! A real psycho!

190
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,884
He's cutting people's heads off.

191
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,802
I'm not kidding!

192
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,472
They're pulling our chain.

193
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,725
Yeah.

194
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,161
What?

195
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,664
Shit.

196
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,004
Howard! Howard!

197
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,633
Carmine?

198
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,185
Who could be doing it?

199
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,978
I'm not accusing anybody.

200
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,439
I'm just saying,
some of my cattle are missing.

201
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,316
Are you serious? Old Fred's dead?

202
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,609
Dude, something like that.

203
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,277
Come on, you're bullshitting me, right, pal?

204
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,738
- What happened to Fred?
- No worse than Edgar.

205
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,782
- What happened to Edgar?
- You won't believe it.

206
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,534
Here, I need one of those candy bars.

207
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,327
I don't believe this. The phone is dead.

208
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,122
- Walter, your phone is dead!
- I didn't do it.

209
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,457
Nestor, what's happening?

210
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,959
Somebody killed old Fred.

211
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,627
What should we do?
- What's going on?

212
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,297
Now, look, Val, you gotta get to Bixby,
and you gotta get the police up here.

213
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,299
And you gotta step on it.

214
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,469
Consider it stepped on.

215
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:09,272
Man, we decided to leave this place
just one damn day too late, you know?

216
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,192
Well, there's sure as hell
nothing to stop us now.

217
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,821
Everybody we know between here
and Bixby is already dead.

218
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,197
Look out!

219
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,122
Is there some higher force at work here?

220
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,501
I mean, are we asking too much of life?

221
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,296
Where the hell are these guys?

222
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,756
What are they doing? Blasting?

223
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,008
Hey!

224
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,429
Where are you guys?
It's not like there's another road, asshole!

225
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,100
Val! Val!

226
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,045
- Jesus! I don't believe this!
- You're hung up.

227
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,672
I am not!

228
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,470
You're hung up, I tell you!

229
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,555
You're gonna burn the clutch!

230
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,067
You know, you could break an axle like that.

231
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,027
Could you shut up?

232
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,780
Hey, I don't need
to spend the night out here.

233
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,827
Crybaby.

234
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,247
Could it have been coyotes?
No way.

235
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,290
No. Coyotes didn't kill Fred.

236
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,584
Hey, it's Val and Earl.

237
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,171
They shouldn't be here already.

238
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,926
- Thought you two were in Bixby by now.
- You are never gonna believe this.

239
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,679
- Mom!
- Oh, my God!

240
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,978
Oh, Burt, be careful.
Unreal.

241
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,523
- Where'd you get it?
- I didn't know we had it.

242
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,817
- It's disgusting.
- Some kind of snake?

243
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,444
Looks more like an eel to me.

244
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,114
Eels live in the water, don't they?

245
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,866
- Big mother slug, maybe.
- Don't touch!

246
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,703
Relax. It's dead.

247
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,888
Hey, it must've grabbed us!
That's why the truck stalled out.

248
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,348
Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...

249
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,934
Hey, wait. This stalled out your truck?

250
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,771
It'd have to be one strong son of a bitch.

251
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,065
Stinks, too.

252
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,901
I'll give you boys $5 for this.

253
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,488
$20.

254
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,657
- Okay, $10!
- $15.

255
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,537
- Okay, $15.
- Damn right, $15.

256
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,664
I don't believe you guys.

257
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,542
Could be a snake!

258
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,628
Some kind of mutation.

259
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,756
Yeah.

260
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,302
Whatever it is,

261
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,807
just one of these couldn't eat up Fred
and his whole flock of sheep.

262
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,602
So you think
there are more of them out there?

263
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,786
I'm dead.
Let's put this stuff up in the morning.

264
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,788
No.

265
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,166
We have to go to Bixby in the morning.

266
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,378
- The cinder blocks are in.
- Oh, the cinder blocks.

267
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,588
Oh, my God!

268
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,674
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.

269
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,387
That's the sky that's gonna be
over our roof every night when we're done.

270
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,515
What if we don't finish the roof?

271
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,434
Then we can look at the sky all the time.
Huh?

272
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,980
Oh, that damn thing.

273
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,659
Maybe it's time
we buy a new generator, huh?

274
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,000
It's gone!

275
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,044
What do you mean, it's gone?

276
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,717
You sure this is where it was?

277
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,595
It was right here! There's the cord.

278
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,930
Hold this.

279
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,400
Yeah, maybe the ground caved in.
There's a lot of mines and stuff around here.

280
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,695
Well, don't then. You don't wanna fall in.

281
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,704
Let's go.

282
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,373
God, what is that stink?

283
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,544
You hear that?

284
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,716
Come on. Come on, let's just go.

285
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,636
Let's go back to town or something.
Please, Jim!

286
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:37,057
Maybe it's a geological thing or something
like natural gas or a geyser.

287
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,559
They stink like that.

288
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,227
Remember in Yellowstone?

289
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,022
- Jim!
- Something's got me!

290
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,275
No, Jim, no!

291
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,986
Something's got me down here!

292
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,323
Oh, Jim!

293
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,034
Oh, God! Oh, God!

294
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,245
Get something! Get something!
Get me out of here!

295
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,503
Jim!

296
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:09,215
Something's got me.
Oh, God! Please get me out!

297
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,219
Help me!

298
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,847
Jim!

299
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,119
Oh, my God.

300
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,139
Mindy, smile.

301
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,350
Come on, honey. Don't look so afraid.
It's not gonna hurt you. I promise.

302
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,394
Mindy, look up. Smile.
- Come on.

303
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,645
Hold it.

304
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,815
Melvin, get out of there!

305
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:56,488
- Old Chang, slick as snot, and I ain't lying.
-15 lousy bucks.

306
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,199
A man who plans ahead...

307
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:04,913
Look, we arm ourselves,
we set perimeters, we stand guard.

308
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,460
Any of those snake things show up here,
we make them extinct.

309
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,129
- All right!
- Come on, Burt, get serious.

310
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,632
Yeah! You make it sound like a war.

311
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,634
What have you people
got against being prepared?

312
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,968
- Where's the sugar?
- Rambo.

313
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,970
Wait a minute. Walter's got a CB radio.

314
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,348
Why aren't you calling somebody in Bixby?
The police...

315
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,934
No. We can't reach outside the valley
because of the mountains.

316
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,562
Melvin, you're next.
Come on. Sit down, look scared.

317
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,064
- Okay.
Yeah.

318
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,942
The phone's out.
The road's out. We're on our own.

319
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,153
You two are just loving it, aren't you?

320
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,405
Come on, Nancy.
Let's don't get personal about this thing!

321
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,949
- We gotta do something.
- Hell, yes!

322
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,661
We are completely cut off.

323
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,499
We got the cliffs to the north.
Mountains to the east and the west.

324
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,877
That's why Heather and me
settled here in the first place.

325
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,879
Geographic isolation.

326
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,173
Well, there's gotta be some way
we can get help.

327
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,425
For God's sake, this isn't the moon!

328
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,095
What are you gonna do,
walk the 38 miles to Bixby?

329
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,517
Hey, there's Walter's saddle horses.

330
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,103
That's it. You're welcome to them.

331
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,980
Somebody could ride to Bixby.

332
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,651
That's not bad. That's not bad.

333
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,403
Who's best on a horse?

334
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,124
Walter, they better be fast.

335
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,210
We don't wanna be stuck
on a couple of canners.

336
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,254
Those snake things couldn't travel that fast.

337
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,589
Shit, for all you know, they could fly.

338
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,176
Here, what do you want?
This colt or Edgar's old rifle?

339
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,469
Rifle.

340
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,394
Hey, Earl. Here's some Swiss cheese
and some bullets.

341
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,812
Thanks, Walter.

342
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,738
- You guys all set?
- Well, ready as we'll ever be.

343
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,072
Heather and I are gonna drive around.

344
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,325
We'll see if we can find that college girl,
tell her to get her ass back into town.

345
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,455
Good idea. We'll swing by the doctor's place
and see if they went into Bixby or not.

346
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,873
Hey, wait a minute, guys.

347
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,042
Y'all gonna have to take something
that packs more of a punch than that 30-30.

348
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,087
Why don't you take
one of our Browning Autos?

349
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,798
Or better than that,
why don't you just take my Model 70?

350
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,384
It's. 375 H&H mag.

351
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,927
Thanks, Heather.

352
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,846
Well, I hope we don't need to use it.

353
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:31,018
It's got me!

354
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,105
- Melvin!
Grow up!

355
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,857
Damn it, Melvin!

356
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,861
- He's only kidding.
- You came that close.

357
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,280
Too close.

358
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,740
No more games.

359
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,537
Melvin, one of these days
somebody's gonna kick your ass.

360
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,286
Doctor?

361
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,182
Man, I hate this shit.

362
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,227
Wait a minute.

363
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,523
The car's gone.
We just missed them, that's all.

364
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,195
Where the hell's
the goddamn golden oldie coming from?

365
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,629
- What the hell's this?
- You got me.

366
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:37,060
Okay, here's the plan.
We don't even stop. We ride like hell.

367
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,063
Tonight we'll keep right on going.
We'll walk the horses.

368
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,481
That is the plan.

369
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,902
I mean, God damn,
what the hell are those things?

370
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,904
And how could they bury
a whole station wagon?

371
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,697
Why would they do it?

372
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,828
Come on, boy! Come on, git, git!

373
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,457
Walter wouldn't know a decent horse
if it came up and bit him in the ass.

374
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,835
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They got wind of something they don't like.

375
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,045
Git.

376
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,300
Something's going on here.

377
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,636
I don't see anything anywhere!

378
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,566
- Hey! Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. What about my horse?

379
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,570
What in the name of...

380
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,120
That's how they get you.
They're under the goddamn ground.

381
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,917
- Well, what the hell are they?
- Sons of bitches!

382
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,181
Must be a million of them!

383
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,601
Nope. Just one.

384
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,066
Come on.

385
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,298
He's gaining on us!

386
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,260
Look!

387
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,932
We can make it! We can make it!

388
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,529
Stupid son of a bitch.

389
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,449
It knocked itself cold.

390
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,952
Cold, my ass!

391
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,455
He's dead.

392
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,167
We killed it.

393
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,670
We killed it!

394
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,630
Fuck you!

395
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,428
Hey, guys. What's going on?

396
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,848
Did you notice anything weird
a minute ago?

397
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,641
I mean, it just...

398
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,397
What's that?

399
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,151
All right, together. One, two, three.

400
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,741
Jesus Christ!

401
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,244
Does it smell like that 'cause it's dead?

402
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,843
I don't see any eyes.

403
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,763
Must be totally subterranean.

404
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,352
- And those tentacles.
- Yeah.

405
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,981
You know, I think they
shoot right out of its mouth,

406
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,902
and they hook you and pull you right in.

407
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,072
Good thing we stopped it
before it killed anybody else.

408
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,117
Look, this is important, you know.

409
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,660
This is like...

410
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,578
Well, let's just say it.

411
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,457
This is probably the biggest
zoological discovery of the century.

412
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,918
Hey! Hey, check this out.

413
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,965
I found the ass end.

414
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,885
Jesus, we really caught something here.

415
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,560
Wow!
Man!

416
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,312
That's one big mother.

417
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,441
This must be the old boy
had your seismos working overtime.

418
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,609
Yeah.

419
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,823
Yeah, it must push itself along with these.

420
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,867
All of them pushing at once.

421
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,412
That's why it moved so fast.

422
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:10,041
I mean, this thing had sensors
tripping all over the place. No...

423
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,627
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard
of anything like this before?

424
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,588
Oh, sure, Earl.
Everybody knows about them.

425
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,173
We just didn't tell you.

426
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,050
Oh, hell, man,
no one ever saw anything like this!

427
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,136
We're really onto something here.

428
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,554
I'll tell you one damn thing,

429
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,391
old Chang don't get his slick mitts on this
for no measly 15 bucks.

430
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,101
You got that right.

431
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,770
All right, here's the plan. We need a flatbed.

432
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,315
- Yeah, right, with a winch.
- Yeah, five-ton maybe.

433
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,818
No, no, no, don't wanna winch it.
Don't wanna winch it. It'd tear it all up.

434
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,529
- All right, a crane?
- Yeah, a crane with lifting straps.

435
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,156
Hey. Hey, shut up.

436
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,117
The way I figure it,
there are three more of these things.

437
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,327
What?

438
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,621
Three more?

439
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,916
I've got seismographs all over this valley.
Now if you compare the different readings.

440
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,959
Here's one at 2:00 yesterday.

441
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,129
But here's one three miles away
at the exact same time. Now that's two.

442
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,173
- But here...
- Yeah, yeah. We'll take your word for it.

443
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,092
- Yeah, where's your truck?
- Just beyond that hill.

444
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,559
What? What?

445
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,817
- Damn prairie dog burrow.
- Little sons of bitches.

446
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,077
Psst! Psst!

447
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,998
This way!

448
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,670
Up on that rock!

449
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,894
Looks like the one
that grabbed our truck.

450
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,273
- Where the hell's your truck?
- It's right over there.

451
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,858
Oh, man,
I don't think we can make that.

452
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,946
At least he can't climb.

453
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,119
Oh, man!

454
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,789
Live ones smell worse than the dead ones.

455
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,545
Phew!

456
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,643
I got it. I got it.

457
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,187
They're mutations caused by radiation.

458
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,106
Or no, no, no.

459
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,985
The government built them.
Big surprise for the Russians.

460
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,822
Well, there's nothing like them
in the fossil record. I'm sure.

461
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:50,327
Okay, so they predate the fossil record.

462
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,789
That would make them
a couple billion years old.

463
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,834
And we've just never seen one till now.

464
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,127
Right.

465
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,756
I vote for outer space.
No way these are local boys.

466
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,263
Well, haven't seen a sign for hours.

467
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,435
- Must be long gone.
- Yeah, must be.

468
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,273
Hey, why don't you take a little stroll
and find out?

469
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,612
We gotta do something.

470
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,083
"We gotta do something. "

471
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:42,003
I don't know why "we" always
has to be "me" every damn time.

472
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:46,341
We, we, we. What do I look like?
An expert on worms?

473
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,718
Watch it, Valentine,
it's got a good six-foot reach.

474
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,178
Thank you, Earl.

475
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,059
Son of a bitch!

476
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,061
Son of a goddamn bitch!

477
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,855
Pardon my French.

478
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,775
Shit! It's been waiting here all this time?

479
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,194
I mean, how's it know we're still here?

480
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,241
Well, it's got no eyes, right?
Sure as hell can't smell us underground.

481
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,118
I say it's been listening.

482
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,078
Of course!

483
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,747
It senses seismic vibration.

484
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,332
It can hear every move we make,

485
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,252
especially on this rock,
it's a perfect conductor.

486
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,004
That means we're stuck. That pisses me off!

487
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:39,102
Well, I hate to be crude,
but I gotta take care of some business.

488
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,187
Me, too.
Same here.

489
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,718
Thanks.

490
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,430
No problem. Anytime.

491
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,819
Well, what's the plan?

492
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:34,282
I think the first thing we gotta do
is see if old stumpy's still out there.

493
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,995
- Can I borrow that shovel?
- Yeah.

494
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,381
Doesn't he have a home to go to?

495
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,176
That's why Edgar
never got down off that damn tower.

496
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,595
- I think I have an idea.
- You know,

497
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,847
we're gonna have to come up
with some sort of plan,

498
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,015
he's just gonna wait us to death.

499
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,892
- Yeah, well, I was...
- Why don't we just make a run for it?

500
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,519
We outran him yesterday.

501
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,521
Run for it? Running's not a plan.

502
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,648
Now running's what you do
when a plan fails.

503
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,858
Valentine, you're not even
trying to think of a plan.

504
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,069
Well, it ain't like we got
a hell of a lot of options.

505
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,364
There's always options.
We just gotta think of them, that's all.

506
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,449
All right, well,
why don't you start thinking?

507
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,952
Why in the hell
do I always have to do all the thinking?

508
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,622
- Who died and made you Einstein?
- You guys know how to pole vault?

509
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,797
We just stay where he can't get us,

510
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,383
on these residual boulders.

511
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,885
My truck's parked right next to one.

512
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,316
Stay on those residual boulders!

513
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:56,322
That Tammy Lynn Baxter,
she do much pole vaulting?

514
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,997
Shit!

515
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,722
That's pretty good.

516
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,287
That slimebag ain't gonna give us
much time once we hit that truck.

517
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,123
- I say we all jump together.
- Right.

518
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,416
Wait.

519
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,629
Okay, ready.

520
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,882
One, two, three!

521
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,391
Go! Go! Go! Go!

522
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,104
Watch it, Val!

523
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,068
Move! Move!

524
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,248
Could somebody, perhaps, help me?

525
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,335
Burt! Heather!
- No! No! No!

526
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,004
The snake things are
just their tongues or something.

527
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,714
These animals are huge!

528
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,718
I'm sorry.
I'm having a real difficult time with this.

529
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,679
Come on, you guys, answer.

530
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,055
- Come back.
- Hey, Walter.

531
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,933
- Where's Burt and Heather?
- I can't reach them.

532
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,103
I guess they're still
driving around somewhere.

533
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,980
Hey, Rhonda,
what's the name you call those things?

534
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,941
- Where do they come from?
- Huh?

535
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,319
- I don't know.
- You're a scientist, aren't you?

536
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,531
Yeah, aren't you supposed
to have a theory or something?

537
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,200
Look, these creatures
are absolutely unprecedented.

538
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,411
Yeah. But where do they come from?

539
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,620
Yeah!

540
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,291
It doesn't matter where they come from.

541
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,585
No name? Ha!

542
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,630
We discovered them, we should name them!

543
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,258
Walter, forget the damn name!

544
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,845
Now me and Earl think we better
get the hell out of this valley.

545
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,139
Hang on, Val. Let's not go off half-cocked.

546
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,474
Yeah. Well, somebody's bound
to come check on us,

547
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,019
once they see the road is out
and the lines are down.

548
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,521
Yeah, that's how it works.

549
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:59,714
- Or "suckoids. " "Oids. "
- Oids. I like snakeoids.

550
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:03,593
One of them comes near me,
and I'll just hit him with a five-pound pickax.

551
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,094
No. You don't understand, Nestor.

552
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,263
They come up from underneath the ground
and they grab you.

553
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,766
They sense the slightest vibration
through the ground.

554
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,727
Even footsteps. That's how they hunt.

555
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,772
Hey, so like we don't vibrate, right?

556
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,442
Maybe they won't even come through here.

557
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,611
Maybe they'll leave us alone!

558
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,863
Chain saw. That's what I'll use.

559
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,865
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up!

560
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,867
Now, look!

561
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,208
You see, they're headed right for us.

562
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,294
Look, they trapped Edgar here.
Grabbed old Fred right here.

563
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:42,548
Nailed those two poor suckers on the road,
and the doctor's place is right here!

564
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,010
Now this valley
is just one long smorgasbord.

565
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,638
We have got to get out.

566
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,684
I'm gonna go get Mindy.

567
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,854
Oh, she's okay.
I saw her playing down the street.

568
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:01,150
That's what I like,
"Graboids"! That's it, graboids!

569
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,902
Jesus, Walter.

570
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,780
We're gonna be sorry
if we don't give it a name.

571
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,990
Okay, Val, you say let's get out of here.

572
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,368
So where are we supposed to go?

573
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,371
Well, Rhonda's got an idea about that.

574
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,875
Yeah, see, they move very easily
through the Pleistocene alluvials.

575
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,838
The dirt.

576
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,131
The loose soil that covers the valley floor.

577
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,175
But they can't move through rock.

578
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,177
So I think we should head west
to the mountains.

579
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,846
She means up the old jeep trail.

580
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,348
If those mountains are solid granite,
we'd be safe there.

581
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,141
And we could hike along them
all the way to Bixby if we...

582
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,605
I scared you, didn't I?

583
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,859
You little ass wipe.

584
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:46,279
You don't knock it off,
you're gonna be shitting this basketball.

585
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,324
Pardon my French.

586
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:58,499
Mindy!

587
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,838
It's gonna take us days
to get back with help with Nestor.

588
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,215
We're not gonna leave you alone.

589
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,681
- Damn it! I'm gonna kick his ass!
- I'm gonna help you.

590
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,143
Melvin!

591
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,146
Where is that little shit stain?

592
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,903
Melvin, get your...

593
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,158
Get inside! Get inside!

594
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,175
- Run! Come on!
- Come on, get in!

595
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:57,558
- No! What are we gonna do?
- Be quiet, quiet, quiet!

596
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,519
Where is he?

597
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:24,961
Now remember,
no noise, no vibrations.

598
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,973
Oh, no, Mindy.

599
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,224
Stop, stop.

600
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,309
Mindy, get off the pogo stick.

601
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,730
Mindy!

602
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,482
Get her, Val!
- Mindy, come back!

603
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,733
Mindy!

604
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:51,904
Oh!

605
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,871
Mindy.
- Quiet. Quiet. Don't move.

606
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,919
Mindy, get back. Get back.

607
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,297
Run! Get in the house!

608
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,059
We gotta get him off.
It'll suck that truck down.

609
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,438
Go back for Christ's sake!

610
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,984
Jesus, here comes another one!

611
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,571
Run! Come on! Come on!

612
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,670
Get out of your pants!

613
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,512
Look out!

614
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,692
Run!

615
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:01,200
Run! Don't look back.
Come on! Come on!

616
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,300
Sorry.

617
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,617
- Rhonda, here.
- Oh, thank you.

618
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,537
So, what are we gonna do?

619
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,957
You know, how long till they go away?

620
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,501
They got the patience of Job.

621
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:57,339
They sit and goddamn wait till they
hear something that sounds like lunch.

622
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,092
- We gotta have a plan.
- I got a plan.

623
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,511
You and Val
drive the truck up to the mountain,

624
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,013
walk to Bixby, get some help.

625
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,641
Walter, those scumsuckers ate our radials.

626
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,602
Well, you can take my truck.

627
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:13,189
No, we need a major four-wheel drive
just to get up that jeep trail.

628
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,816
That trail's all messed up.

629
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,946
Turn it off.

630
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,909
Pull it back. Pull it back.

631
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,123
I got it.

632
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,054
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

633
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,816
Son of a bitch.

634
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,778
Son of a bitch!

635
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,963
Come on, let's go! The roof!

636
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,818
Come on!

637
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,785
Jump, Rho! You can do it!
- No, I can't! I can't!

638
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,042
Rhonda! Don't stop. Keep moving!

639
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,299
Oh, my God.

640
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,092
Hey!

641
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,224
You okay?

642
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,604
Hey, what's going on?
Where are you guys?

643
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,482
What's up, man?
What the hell are you doing up there?

644
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,610
Melvin, shut the hell up.

645
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,571
- Get up on your roof.
No way!

646
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,925
Nestor?

647
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,763
Nancy, get up on your roofs.

648
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,974
Up on your roofs!
They come through the floor!

649
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,614
I don't know. I can't believe it.

650
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,908
No tracks.

651
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,619
No sign. No spoor.

652
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:18,832
You'd think after eating all those sheep
they'd have to take a dump someplace.

653
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,085
Yeah. I don't understand it.

654
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,358
Yo, Walter.
This is Burt. Come back.

655
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,154
Walter? Anybody copy?

656
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,783
I'm waiting.

657
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,286
- Walter, you there? Come back!
- Okay, I got it.

658
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,715
Yo, who's minding the store,
for God's sake?

659
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,678
Burt, listen.
We found out what's been killing people.

660
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,721
- Say "over. "
- Over.

661
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,142
Negative copy on that, Walter.
Check your frequency.

662
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,770
I'm on 22. Come back.

663
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,356
Burt, can you hear me now? Over.

664
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,234
Val, is that you?
What're you doing back already?

665
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,570
Hey, Burt, something real weird
is going on over there.

666
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,447
They're up on top of the roof.

667
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,048
Hey, I think they're going for Burt's.

668
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,054
Oh, man, they're going!

669
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,100
Burt, get out of your basement.
Take your radio.

670
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,812
You and Heather get up on your roof.
We'll talk later. Okay? Over.

671
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,148
Up on the roof?
Val, what are you talking about?

672
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,443
Damn it, Burt. Just listen to him.
Something's wrong.

673
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,528
Burt, Jesus Christ!

674
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,822
Get up on your roof! The things!

675
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,365
They're under the ground.

676
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,992
They're bigger than we thought.
They're huge.

677
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,037
They're coming right after you guys.
They're coming right now!

678
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,016
We don't see anything, Val.
What the hell are you talking about? Over.

679
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,603
Burt, they're under the ground.
They're under the ground.

680
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,398
They can dig like a son of a bitch.
Big monsters! Underground! Now get out!

681
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,733
Hurry!

682
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,214
Jesus Christ!

683
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,839
Burt, come on.

684
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,933
- Magazine!
- Here!

685
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,457
Here!

686
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,674
Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room
didn't you, you bastard?

687
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,638
We killed it! You got that?
We killed that motherhumper! Come back.

688
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:29,351
Well, roger that, Burt. And congratulations.

689
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:33,563
Be advised, however, there are two more.
Repeat, two more motherhumpers.

690
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,286
Burt got one! He killed one!

691
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,832
- Way to go, dude!
- All right!

692
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,336
Yes! Yes!

693
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:00,841
Well, I guess we don't get to make fun
of Burt's lifestyle anymore, huh?

694
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,050
Say, Burt?

695
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,720
Any chance you can get the other two?
Come back.

696
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,055
Yeah. One second, pal.

697
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:19,276
You didn't get penetration
even with the elephant gun.

698
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,485
Shit!

699
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,696
Good Lord!

700
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,537
Val, we can't get them.

701
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,707
I never figured
on having to shoot through dirt.

702
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,668
The best goddamn bullet stop there is.
Come back.

703
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,880
Let me see that.

704
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,760
Burt, listen. Forget shooting them.
Tell me this. Can you get to your truck?

705
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,094
- Over.
- No problem.

706
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,637
Good, 'cause you have
the only truck in the valley

707
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,097
that can get up that jeep trail.

708
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,141
Now listen. Here's the plan.

709
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,101
You and Heather go for help.

710
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,980
- You get to the mountains and keep going...
- Guys! You guys!

711
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,815
- Come over.
- Hang on a sec.

712
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,693
He's up to something.

713
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,321
Well, if it isn't
our old pal, stumpy.

714
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,572
Bastard.

715
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,958
Hey, Rhonda.
What do you think it's trying to do now?

716
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,127
Why do you keep asking me?

717
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,724
- What the...
- What the...

718
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,400
Gee! Wow.

719
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,905
What the hell was that?

720
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:50,826
Breaker there, Earl.
What did you want us to do? Come back.

721
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:55,205
Hang on, Burt.
This bastard's trying something new.

722
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,791
Over.

723
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:16,184
They wasn't making no noise.

724
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,144
Why is he bothering them for?

725
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,523
Well, it's like it's studying the buildings,
trying to figure them out.

726
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,693
They can feel our vibrations
but they can't find us.

727
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,571
Looks to me
like they're coming up with a plan.

728
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,954
Watch it, Nestor!

729
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,169
Jesus!

730
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,968
Shit! Enough!

731
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,269
Get off the ground, Nestor!
Get moving!

732
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,354
Get out of there! Get off the ground!

733
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,106
Move it! Move it!

734
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:08,111
No, Nestor. That's no good.
Come on, you gotta get higher.

735
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,374
No way! No way, man!

736
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,003
No! You guys gotta do something!

737
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,506
You gotta do something!

738
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,429
Burt, Heather?

739
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,976
Yeah, you got us, Val. Come on back. Over.

740
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:43,730
Listen, we're in deep shit over here.
We'll have to change that plan.

741
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:49,361
- Burt, cut it out!
- I think I scared him.

742
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,363
No use going for help.

743
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:54,449
We'd be dead
long before you'd ever get back.

744
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:58,328
Okay, Val, we're with you.
Just tell us what you wanna do. Over.

745
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:01,790
Yeah, well, this one's gonna
tear this town out from under us.

746
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,459
We're all gonna have to
get out of here together, now.

747
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:05,669
Okay, Val.

748
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,880
We're coming after everybody.
Just hang tight. Over.

749
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:10,882
Look.

750
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,950
Val, you're gonna have to
forget about the truck.

751
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:38,743
Yeah, we got you, Heather.

752
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:44,082
Now, look. The situation hasn't changed.

753
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,460
We still have to make it to solid rock.
There's gotta be some way.

754
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,256
Like what? There's nothing left
that can make it to those mountains.

755
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,468
Hey, Val. Quiet, man.

756
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,014
It doesn't matter now. They know we're here.

757
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,766
Oh, shit!
We need a helicopter is what we need.

758
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,269
- Or a goddamn tank!
- Wait a minute.

759
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,313
Wait a minute. The Cat!

760
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:11,151
- Could we take the Cat?
- Oh, Jesus. It's slower than hell.

761
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,529
Yeah, but it weighs better than 30 tons.
There's no way they could lift 30 tons.

762
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:18,575
- Could they? I mean...
- But we can't all fit on the bulldozer.

763
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,412
No.

764
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:26,207
No, but we could drag something, though.

765
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,294
We could pull a car behind it. I don't know.

766
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,464
Hell, that old semitrailer.

767
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,216
- Its tires are flat.
- Doesn't matter.

768
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,511
- That Cat can pull anything.
- Well, all right.

769
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:42,223
- We just roll on out of here.
- We've got a plan!

770
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,565
Of course, that's a hell of a long walk.

771
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:54,027
Listen, they only respond
to vibration, right?

772
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,738
Well, couldn't we distract them somehow?

773
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,074
Yeah. Good.

774
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,826
Something to keep them busy, like a decoy.

775
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,872
Hey, Melvin, you wanna make a buck?

776
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,750
- Eat it!
- How about the tractor?

777
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,586
Walter's little tractor? Start him up.

778
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,379
Let him go out by himself.

779
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:17,008
Let those things follow him all over
if they like that noise.

780
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,552
Not bad. What do you think?

781
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,567
- Ground's getting closer, Earl.
- Yeah.

782
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,569
I say we go with Miguel's plan.

783
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,515
Just hold on, Nancy!

784
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:07,892
- I'm making the run for the Cat.
- Like hell you are.

785
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,645
- Get real, Earl. I'm faster than you.
- But I'm best at driving the Cat.

786
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,148
- Not while I'm around.
- Look, damn it! Now listen to me.

787
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,526
- I'm older and I'm wiser.
- Yeah? Well, you're half right.

788
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:23,658
Damn! I lost. Guess I'll have to do it.

789
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,702
I won. I pick who does it.

790
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,496
Ready when you are, Miguel.

791
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:46,139
There he is. There he goes!

792
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,892
He's chasing it. He's chasing it.

793
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:56,024
It's going. This one's going, too!

794
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,945
- Good luck, shithead.
- Don't worry about me, jerk-off.

795
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,370
Shit!

796
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,667
You suicidal son of a bitch.

797
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:31,976
Keep going!

798
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,153
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

799
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:46,741
Come on!

800
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,953
They're gonna get him!

801
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:54,832
Val, stop! They're coming! Be quiet!

802
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,167
Don't move!

803
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,639
It worked. They can't find him.

804
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,982
We gotta...

805
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,943
We gotta make some noise.

806
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,444
A lot of noise!

807
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:27,740
Hey, you sorry sons of bitches!
Come and get my ass!

808
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:31,786
Over here, you slime bucket! Come get me!

809
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:44,590
Come on. What are you, scared?
Come on.

810
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,438
Hey, what's she doing?

811
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,579
That did it, girl! God damn good thinking.

812
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,792
- You okay?
- Yeah.

813
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:49,382
Here goes.

814
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,310
- Here.
- Yeah.

815
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,081
God damn!

816
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,167
Armored transport.

817
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:25,960
Burt! Heather!

818
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:27,420
Let's get going! Let's move it.

819
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:29,338
Burt! Heather!

820
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,426
Come on, let's go, you two.
We're headed for the mountains.

821
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,137
If that's how we're doing it,
we're going prepared.

822
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:39,640
We can't hold still long.
These things are damn smart.

823
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:42,310
- They're getting smarter by the minute.
- That's fine.

824
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,020
We've got some new things to teach them.

825
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,077
You see that?

826
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,997
They're doing it again.
They try it every time I stop!

827
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:04,582
Come on, now.

828
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,169
Jesus Christ! We're only going nine miles.

829
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:11,714
Yeah, well, those things are gonna be
on our ass every foot of the way, right?

830
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,176
Just hurry!
Burt, Heather, what are you doing up there?

831
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,595
Can't you see we're sinking?
Get in the trailer!

832
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,516
- What do you think? Max firepower or this?
- I go for penetration.

833
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,019
The. 458, shooting solids.
Less ammo to carry.

834
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,771
Come on, Burt. Move it!

835
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,815
Watch these ammo boxes!

836
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,610
Come on, Burt!
Heather, hurry!

837
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,363
- Tell them to come on!
- Okay, now!

838
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,740
Now! Come on! Come on!

839
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,956
Hey, give me a gun. I'll take one.

840
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,792
I wouldn't give you a gun
if it was World War lll.

841
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:09,480
Food for five years.

842
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:14,735
A thousand gallons of gas, air filtration,
water filtration, Geiger counter,

843
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,362
bomb shelter.

844
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,493
Underground goddamn monsters!

845
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:38,175
Yo, there we go! Solid rock.

846
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:47,560
Any sign of them?

847
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,022
Maybe they just gave up, you know?

848
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:55,818
Hey, what's that?

849
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,197
Damn it! What the hell are they doing?

850
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:04,660
I don't care what they're doing
as long as they're doing it way over there.

851
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,252
Wait, wait! Look out!

852
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:19,508
Mindy!

853
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:21,552
- Mommy!
- Everybody stay here.

854
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,429
- Burt, you okay?
- I'm okay.

855
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:25,931
Are they gonna get us?
What happened?

856
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,561
- Burt, you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

857
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,731
Earl, what happened?
What happened?

858
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,150
They dug a trap.

859
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,069
I can't believe this.

860
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:41,405
All right.

861
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,366
Here.

862
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,339
Let me have my gun.

863
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:05,179
Hungry? Eat this!

864
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,556
Everybody down!

865
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,651
There they are!

866
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,945
Did you get one?
I don't know.

867
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:24,240
No, there's still two of them.
Look, there're two different dust trails.

868
01:18:24,324 --> 01:18:26,158
Sure made them
think twice though.

869
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,576
What the hell's in those things, Burt?

870
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:30,329
A few household chemicals
in the proper proportion.

871
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,003
Here they come. They're coming back!

872
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,638
We'll have to make a run for those rocks.

873
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,557
I don't know, Val.
That's a hell of a long way.

874
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,850
Yeah, man, they'll get us!

875
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,394
They're sure as hell
gonna get us if we stay here.

876
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:55,688
Hey, Burt!
You have any more of those bombs?

877
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:57,106
We've got you covered, Rhonda.

878
01:18:57,190 --> 01:19:00,401
Well, what if we throw one that way,
the way that we wanna go?

879
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:02,987
Then when it explodes,
I mean, if it drives them away,

880
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,322
we run like goddamn bastards.

881
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,366
Pardon my French.

882
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:12,455
What if they don't get scared?
What if they don't run?

883
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:14,874
I don't think it does scare them.
It hurts them.

884
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,168
They're so sensitive to sound,
they gotta run.

885
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,003
Oh, hell, she's got my vote!

886
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,672
That's it! We're making a run for it!

887
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,092
- We're going for the rocks.
- I don't know, man. They're too fast.

888
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:29,638
- You can't outrun them. No way!
- Yo, Melvin. This'll make them think twice.

889
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,891
Everybody ready to run?

890
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,191
Heads down!

891
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,035
It worked! There they go!

892
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,745
All right, let's go!

893
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:55,080
Move.
There you go.

894
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,335
Here. Come on, Burt.

895
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:03,756
Oh, fuck.

896
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,258
Oh, Burt, you asshole!

897
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,014
Mommy!

898
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:13,891
Mindy, get up. Get up.

899
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:24,276
- Get up here!
I'm with you, honey.

900
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,654
Go, go, go!

901
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:36,705
Burt, you asshole!
There's no bullets in this gun.

902
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:39,416
Got you moving, didn't it?

903
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,322
So, now what?

904
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,660
Could we make it to the mountains,
use Burt's explosives?

905
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:15,953
No way.

906
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,789
We'd need 50 of those bombs.

907
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,291
Well, that's it.

908
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,043
We're not getting off this rock.

909
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:27,172
Well, we're not gonna pole vault out of here.

910
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:28,841
That's for damn sure.

911
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:31,051
Wait a minute.

912
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,429
What're y'all talking about?

913
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:35,472
It's like you're giving up or something.

914
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:39,768
They'll just wait out there till we're dead.
That's exactly what they do.

915
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:42,313
Wait!

916
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:45,566
For Christ sake,
we could've made a stand at our place.

917
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:49,737
- We had food, water.
- You can't fight them like that.

918
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:53,032
So you two screw-ups
hauled us way the hell out here?

919
01:21:56,828 --> 01:22:00,080
Hey, why don't you just back off,
string bean?

920
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,166
You know, we could've
left your worthless ass on the roof!

921
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,918
I wish you had, fearless leader.

922
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:06,086
- Who the hell put you two in charge?
- Don't push me!

923
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,589
Just back off, Burt.
- Just don't goddamn push me!

924
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,594
If them graboids don't kill him, I will.

925
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:14,845
What?

926
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:18,182
They'd have torn your place
out from under you in half an hour.

927
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:21,769
Come on. Come on.
Just let it go. Let it go. Forget about it.

928
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:25,481
I know he does.
He thinks he knows everything.

929
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:41,205
If it comes to starvation,
I know what I'm doing.

930
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,291
Take one of these,

931
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:49,046
walk right out there with the fuse lit
and let them take me down.

932
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:51,882
Boom.

933
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,304
Good Lord, honey.

934
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,058
Now that's not a bad idea.

935
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:04,603
No, no. It gives me an idea.

936
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:06,271
Going fishing like.

937
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,779
There's one. Straight out in front.

938
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:16,198
Let's see if we can keep him right there.

939
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:19,326
- All right, how much we need?
- I don't know. They're pretty quick.

940
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:21,245
Fifteen seconds at least.

941
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:26,083
- Which kind of fuse is that?
- Cannon fuse.

942
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:29,378
- What the hell you use if for?
- My cannon.

943
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:31,171
You guys watch yourselves.

944
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,011
Right out there about 30...

945
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,471
Oh, man.
You're not gonna do your lasso thing?

946
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:42,057
Just 'cause you're no good with a rope.

947
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:47,688
All right, get back!

948
01:23:57,615 --> 01:23:59,116
Come on, baby.

949
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,411
Take it. Take the bait!

950
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,792
Yeah! All right!

951
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,716
- Look at it!
- Yeah!

952
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:23,807
All right!

953
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:36,653
Okay, one to go.

954
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,157
Damn! Where the hell is he?

955
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:42,993
Hope he didn't wise up.

956
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:47,164
There.

957
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:50,834
Look who it is.

958
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,336
Give me that thing.

959
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,838
This son of a bitch is mine.

960
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,052
There it goes!

961
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:02,262
- All right, get back!
- I got it.

962
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:03,931
Come on. Come on.

963
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,862
Come on, lunchtime, snot head.

964
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:23,158
All right, get down!

965
01:25:25,995 --> 01:25:27,162
Shit!

966
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,209
Oh, my God! It's...

967
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,336
- Get back! Get back!
- Run!

968
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,548
Get up, come on!

969
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:55,065
What are you doing out there?

970
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:13,709
Okay, let's make some noise.
Try to distract him. Come on, everybody.

971
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:30,809
Fresh meat!

972
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:46,241
Wait, wait, wait.

973
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:51,079
This one's not falling for it.

974
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,708
This one ain't dumb.

975
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:57,753
He's trying to trick us.

976
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,798
Use your bomb.

977
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,967
It's our last one.

978
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:07,679
What else you gonna use it for?

979
01:27:08,514 --> 01:27:10,766
So what if we make it to the rocks?

980
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,060
We'll be dead in three days anyway.

981
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,437
Well, I wanna live for the three days.

982
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:17,439
What the hell? What's the matter?

983
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:20,859
- Use the bomb, for God sakes!
Throw that bomb, man!

984
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,486
Scare him away!

985
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,489
Throw the bomb!

986
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,662
This bastard ain't smarter than us.

987
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,706
For Christ's sake, Val!

988
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,250
I'm gonna go for it.

989
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,751
Go for what?

990
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:52,683
- What are you doing?
- I got a goddamn plan!

991
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:57,354
Where the hell is it?

992
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:02,859
I've got it!

993
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,826
This better be one hell of a great plan!

994
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:19,543
Get ready!

995
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:23,088
- Light it, man! Light it!
- Not yet. Not yet!

996
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:25,257
Come on. What are you waiting for?

997
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,301
Go!

998
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,013
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

999
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,391
Too far! You threw it behind him.

1000
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:43,191
Run, Val! Run!

1001
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:49,239
Yeah!

1002
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:54,411
Can you fly, you sucker? Can you fly?

1003
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:26,068
Well, it just suddenly hit me, you know.

1004
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,320
Stampede.

1005
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:36,787
Way to go!

1006
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:38,622
Way to go, Val!

1007
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:50,342
Now, the second we hit Bixby,
we start making some phone calls.

1008
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:52,886
I mean, we could make
some real money on this thing.

1009
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,514
We could get in People magazine.

1010
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:58,767
People? Hell! National Geographic.

1011
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:01,311
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1012
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:04,898
Smile.

1013
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,662
Burt loaned me his camera.

1014
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,164
Yeah. He gave us these tires, too.

1015
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,255
It's all pretty exciting, huh?

1016
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,968
There's gonna be major research,
and I'm gonna be in on it.

1017
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:37,514
The first thing to do is take some pictures
of that one we dug up.

1018
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:40,016
Yeah. Yeah.

1019
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:42,519
Pictures seem like a good idea.

1020
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:48,650
Yeah, well, thanks for everything,
you know, saving my life and stuff.

1021
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:53,071
You're welcome.

1022
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,034
- Maybe I'll see you sometime?
- Uh-huh.

1023
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,755
Well, see you.

1024
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:20,307
I know. I know! I'm working up to it.

1025
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:22,893
What am I doing?

1026
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:26,062
I mean, what's a woman like her
want with a guy like me?

1027
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,398
She's going for her damn PhD.

1028
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:32,486
Rhonda?

1029
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,488
Yeah?

1030
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:37,282
Well, I just wanted to...
