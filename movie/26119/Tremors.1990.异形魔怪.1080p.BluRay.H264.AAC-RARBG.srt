1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
                                    
                                       

2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,637
Good morning, Mr. Basset.
This is your wake-up call.

3
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:02,980
Please move your ass.

4
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:18,991
Stampede!

5
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,543
Stampede, Earl! Get out of the way!

6
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:29,181
You dumb shit.

7
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,269
l was in a stampede once.

8
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,608
300 head going hell-bent for the horizon.

9
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:42,069
Exactly how many cows
are required for a stampede, Earl?

10
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:45,535
l mean, is it like three or more?
ls there a minimum speed?

11
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:48,031
l wish a stampede up your ass.

12
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:21,864
No breakfast?

13
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:25,338
l did it yesterday.
lt was bologna and beans.

14
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,884
No. lt was eggs. l did eggs...

15
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:31,460
...over easy.

16
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:35,388
The hell you did.
Bologna and beans. lt's your turn.

17
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:46,691
l guess when l'm your age...

18
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,742
...l'll forget what l eat, too.

19
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:56,747
Goddamn it!

20
00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:00,426
l ask you, is this a job for intelligent men?

21
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,253
Show me one. l'll ask him.

22
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:06,557
lf we were serious about money,
we'd quit being hired hands.

23
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:09,893
Handymen, Earl. We are handymen.

24
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,223
We should quit this job...

25
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:14,559
...and find ourselves
some real employment.

26
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,323
Are you going to give up
all this personal freedom?

27
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,652
l don't know.

28
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:33,874
Freeway!

29
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:36,673
What's on the agenda for today?

30
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:40,135
-lt's garbage day.
-Man! Already?

31
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:42,437
What's Nestor paying us?

32
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:46,649
$50. And that's $47 more than we got.

33
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:50,696
Burt and Heather's place is closer.
Let's do their linoleum today...

34
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,361
...and the garbage tomorrow.

35
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:55,619
Nestor's not home tomorrow.
We don't dig today, we're not paid.

36
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:58,074
Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.

37
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,910
You never take the long view.
Here it is Monday...

38
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:03,247
...and l'm already thinking of Wednesday.

39
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,629
lt is Monday, right?

40
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,351
Who the hell's that?
That's not the grad student?

41
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:15,604
-No. He graduated. Must be the new one.
-The new one?

42
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,145
That's supposed to be a girl.

43
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:29,744
You will have long, blonde hair...

44
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,747
...big green eyes, world-class breasts...

45
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:37,466
...ass that won't quit
and legs that go all the way up!

46
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,275
Hi! l'm Rhonda LeBeck.
l'm up here for the semester.

47
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,812
-Yeah, geography.
-Geology.

48
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:57,403
Well, actually seismology. Earthquakes.

49
00:04:57,995 --> 00:04:59,703
You two must be Val and Earl.

50
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:02,578
-l've heard all about you.
-We deny everything.

51
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,546
l've got a question for you.

52
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:09,668
Do you know if anybody's
doing any drilling or blasting...

53
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,421
...or anything like that?

54
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:15,094
Around here? No, ma'am.

55
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:19,146
l'm supposed to monitor the seismographs.

56
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:22,266
You know, they measure vibrations.

57
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,444
Vibrations in the ground.

58
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:25,812
Yeah.

59
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,952
l've been getting
some really strange readings.

60
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:34,160
The school's had the machines here, and
we've never recorded anything like this.

61
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,786
We'll ask around.
See if anyone's heard anything.

62
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:39,877
Thanks.

63
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:44,008
God, l hope they're not broken.
l might have to bag the whole semester.

64
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:46,888
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

65
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:48,555
No problem.

66
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:51,642
Nice meeting you.
Hope you get it all sorted out.

67
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:10,331
lf you wanted,
we could take a look at those...

68
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,798
...seismographs for her if you want.

69
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:16,293
What the hell do we know
about seismographs?

70
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:17,587
Nothing.

71
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,727
-lt might be a slick way to get to know her.
-Why?

72
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,307
Damn it, Valentine.

73
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:27,189
You don't go for any gal
unless she fits your list, top to bottom.

74
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,769
-Well sure!
-lt's dumber than my hind end.

75
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,323
l mean, like that...

76
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,694
...Bobby Lynn Dexter.

77
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:35,495
Tammy Lynn Baxter.

78
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:38,703
lt don't matter.
They're all the same: dead weight.

79
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:40,960
''Oh, l broke a nail!''

80
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,756
Makes my skin crawl.

81
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:46,713
l'm a victim of circumstance.

82
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,347
l thought you call it your pecker.

83
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,137
Pizza-face!

84
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,098
Melvin.

85
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,065
You touch that truck and die.

86
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,686
Man, l'm really shaking.

87
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:36,648
Thanks, Walter.

88
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:39,988
These are hollow points,
but not hydro-shock hollow points.

89
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,916
-Bullets are bullets.
-Hi, guys. What's happening?

90
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,623
We ran into that new college student,
that Rona.

91
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:49,249
Rhonda. She's having trouble with her...

92
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,002
...things.

93
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,885
Those college kids turn up
oil or uranium or something out there...

94
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:03,018
...next thing the Feds will be at our door.
''Sorry. Time to move. Eminent domain.''

95
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,611
Down, honey. Down.

96
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,854
Yeah, Burt. The way you worry...

97
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:10,864
...you'll get a heart attack before
you get a chance to survive World War lll.

98
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:12,116
We'll see.

99
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:19,252
Guys, listen. Bearing going out.
What do you think?

100
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:22,717
-Could be.
-Later, Chang. We got a schedule to keep.

101
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:27,097
Yeah. See, we plan ahead.
That way we don't do anything right now.

102
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:28,381
Earl explained it to me.

103
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,149
Cocktail?

104
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,068
You bet.

105
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,244
l'll tell you.

106
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:30,046
Nobody handles garbage
better than we do.

107
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:37,474
Come on, Earl. This is low.

108
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,891
We have got to set our sights
a little bit higher.

109
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:50,112
Melvin, why don't you give us a hand?
Most of this shit is yours anyway.

110
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:54,779
Listen, run to the store
and pick me up a six-pack. l'll pay for it.

111
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,289
Son, beer is for adults.

112
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,757
Not having a plan
is what keeps us doing jobs like this.

113
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:06,005
Just doing jobs like this
is you dragging your feet.

114
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:10,768
Are you going to stand there and tell me
l'm the reason we're still in Perfection?

115
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:13,606
You know how close l am
to leaving this place right now?

116
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,265
l'll call that little bluff. How close?

117
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:20,314
-Shit!
-Goddamn!

118
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:25,110
Jesus Christ! Goddamn!

119
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,203
Don't forget the TV.

120
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:32,623
-Why you bringing the vacuum cleaner?
-l like it.

121
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:35,337
-You never use it.
-lt's good for parts.

122
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:41,009
Besides, maybe we'll hire a maid.
You think about that?

123
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,512
Get in the truck.

124
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:52,646
Guys!

125
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:56,869
Guys, wait!

126
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:04,416
Sorry, Nancy.
We're not delivering firewood anymore.

127
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:07,289
-We're heading for Bixby permanent.
-Sure.

128
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:10,594
Oh, my God. You really are!

129
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:14,763
Mindy, what's the count?

130
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,597
640.

131
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:21,983
l don't need firewood. l have this big order
to fill and have to build my pottery kiln.

132
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,986
Come on, it'll be at least a month's work.

133
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:27,577
l'll throw in lunches.

134
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:30,117
And beer.

135
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,956
l can't believe we said no to free beer.

136
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,553
We did it! We faced temptation
and did not bend!

137
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,432
Goddamn! Praise the Lord!

138
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:50,262
Now there's nothing, and l mean nothing,
between us and Bixby.

139
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:57,527
Look at that guy!

140
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:00,696
That's one job l'd never do.
Working around electricity.

141
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,788
Hold up.

142
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,744
That's Edgar Deems.

143
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:06,576
Come on.

144
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:09,335
He only wears that one damn jacket.

145
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,584
That's him, l'm telling you.

146
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,734
He sure must've been drunk this time.

147
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,113
Get your butt down from there!

148
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:38,870
Shit.

149
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,206
We can't leave him up there.

150
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:52,347
Thank you, Edgar.

151
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:58,444
You owe me on this one,
you damned old boozehound.

152
00:14:05,747 --> 00:14:09,615
One of these days, you'll have
to get your ass on a wagon and stay there.

153
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:13,252
lt's not like l don't have
better things to do than climb towers...

154
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:15,957
...and drag your hairy ass down.

155
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:19,211
Jesus!

156
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:28,566
Was it a heart attack, doctor?

157
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:31,645
No.

158
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:35,315
He died of dehydration. Thirst.

159
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:39,495
That doesn't make any sense.
That takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

160
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:41,160
Maybe even three or four.

161
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,127
You mean he sat up there
three or four days?

162
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,541
He sat up there and just died of thirst?

163
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:01,474
You reckon he hated Perfection
more than us?

164
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,814
-Do you suppose he wanted to kill himself?
-Somebody must've chased him up there.

165
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:10,400
You mean someone that ain't scared
of a Winchester rifle?

166
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:15,658
Then what'd they do?
Camp out and wait for him to die?

167
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,122
What the hell?

168
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:36,814
What the shit?

169
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:40,233
Fred!

170
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:05,562
-This is weird.
-This is real weird.

171
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:12,103
-Jesus!
-What the hell's going on?

172
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,982
l mean, what the hell is going on?

173
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:27,591
Get the hell out of here!
There's a killer on the loose!

174
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:30,465
-What?
-A murderer, man! A real psycho!

175
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:33,433
He's cutting people's heads off.
l'm not kidding!

176
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:36,600
They're pulling our chain.

177
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,728
Yeah.

178
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:59,211
What?

179
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:08,056
Howard!

180
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:12,597
Carmine?

181
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,246
Who could be doing it?

182
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:27,544
l'm not accusing anybody,
but some of my cattle are missing.

183
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,870
Are you serious? Old Fred's dead?

184
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:33,588
-You're bullshitting me.
-What happened to Fred?

185
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:34,876
Worse than Edgar.

186
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:37,213
-What happened to him?
-You won't believe it.

187
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:40,808
-l need a candy bar.
-l don't believe this. The phone's dead.

188
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:43,352
-Walter, your phone is dead!
-l didn't do it.

189
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,184
Nestor, what's happening?

190
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:48,777
-Somebody killed old Fred.
-What's going on?

191
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:54,198
Val, you've got to get to Bixby,
and get the police up here. And step on it.

192
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:57,873
Consider it stepped on.

193
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:08,722
We decided to leave this place
one damn day too late, you know?

194
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:12,345
There's sure as hell
nothing to stop us now.

195
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:16,100
Everybody we know between here
and Bixby is already dead.

196
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:17,520
Look out!

197
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,359
ls there some higher force at work here?

198
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:29,621
l mean, are we asking too much of life?

199
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,743
Where the hell are these guys?

200
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,622
What are they doing? Blasting?

201
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,629
Where are you guys?
lt's not like there's another road, assholes!

202
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:13,092
-Jesus! l don't believe this!
-You're hung up.

203
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:15,930
l am not!

204
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:21,100
You're hung up, l tell you!

205
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:23,775
You're going to burn the clutch!

206
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,417
-You could break an axle like that.
-Could you shut up?

207
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,623
l don't need to spend the night out here.

208
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:45,963
Crybaby.

209
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:48,601
-Could it have been coyotes?
-No way.

210
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,513
Coyotes didn't kill Fred.

211
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,932
lt's Val and Earl.

212
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:56,146
They shouldn't be here already.

213
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,610
-Thought you two were in Bixby by now.
-You're won't believe this.

214
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,910
-Mom!
-Oh, my God!

215
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:11,205
-Burt, be careful.
-Unreal.

216
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:14,796
-Where'd you get it?
-l didn't know we had it.

217
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,338
-lt's disgusting.
-Some kind of snake?

218
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:21,852
-lt's more like an eel to me.
-Eels live in the water, don't they?

219
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:25,096
-Big mother slug, maybe.
-Don't touch!

220
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,767
Relax. lt's dead.

221
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:46,176
lt must've grabbed us!

222
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:49,049
-That's why the truck stalled.
-l said l wasn't hung up.

223
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:50,800
This stalled out your truck?

224
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,761
lt'd have to be one strong son of a bitch.

225
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,186
Stinks, too.

226
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,191
l'll give you boys $5 for this.

227
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:03,444
$20.

228
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,907
-Okay, $10!
-$15.

229
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:10,618
-Okay, $15.
-Damn right, $15.

230
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,537
l don't believe you guys.

231
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:15,625
Could be a snake!

232
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:18,842
Some kind of mutation.

233
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:25,512
Whatever it is...

234
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:30,850
...just one of these couldn't eat up Fred
and his whole flock of sheep.

235
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:33,395
You think there are more out there?

236
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:51,008
l'm dead.
Let's put this stuff up in the morning.

237
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:56,471
We have to go to Bixby in the morning.

238
00:22:57,186 --> 00:23:01,600
-The cinder blocks are in.
-The cinder blocks. Oh, my God!

239
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:04,986
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.

240
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:08,732
That's the sky that'll be
over our roof every night when we're done.

241
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:13,904
What if we don't finish the roof?
Then we can look at the sky all the time.

242
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,503
That damn thing.

243
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:30,848
Maybe it's time we buy a new generator.

244
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:39,145
lt's gone!

245
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,275
What do you mean, it's gone?

246
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,952
You sure this is where it was?

247
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:51,752
lt was right here! There's the cord.
Hold this.

248
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:03,519
Maybe the ground caved in.
There's mines and stuff around here.

249
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:06,982
Well, don't then. You don't want to fall in.

250
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:15,991
Let's go.

251
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,533
God, what is that stink?

252
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,869
You hear that?

253
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,591
Come on. Let's just go.

254
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:31,887
Let's go back to town or something.
Please, Jim!

255
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:35,387
Maybe it's a geological thing
like natural gas...

256
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,396
...or a geyser. They stink like that.
Remember in Yellowstone?

257
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:42,732
Something's got me!

258
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:48,529
Something's got me down here!

259
00:24:55,256 --> 00:24:57,961
Get something. Get me out of here!

260
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:09,183
Something's got me. Please get me out!

261
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,021
Help me!

262
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:38,347
Oh, my God.

263
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,514
-Don't look so afraid. lt won't hurt you.
-Mindy look up. Smile.

264
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:45,934
Hold it.

265
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:49,018
Melvin, get out of there!

266
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:55,657
-Old Chang, slick as snot, and l ain't lying.
-A lousy $15.

267
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:58,574
A man who plans ahead.

268
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:04,375
We arm ourselves,
we set perimeters, we stand guard.

269
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:08,342
Any of those snake things show up here,
we make 'em extinct.

270
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,170
-All right!
-Burt, get serious.

271
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:13,509
Yeah! You make it sound like a war.

272
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:16,226
What've you got against being prepared?

273
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:17,227
Rambo.

274
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,902
Walter's got a CB radio.
Why aren't you calling Bixby? The police--

275
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:25,198
We can't reach outside the valley
because of the mountains.

276
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:28,985
You're next. Sit down, look scared.

277
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,784
The phone's out. The road's out.
We're on our own.

278
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,411
You two are just loving it, aren't you?

279
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:38,756
Nancy, don't get personal about this!
We've got to do something.

280
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:40,006
Hell, yes!

281
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:42,756
We are completely cut off.

282
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:47,552
We got the cliffs to the north,
mountains to the east and the west.

283
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:52,648
That's why Heather and me settled here.
Geographic isolation.

284
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,324
-There's got to be a way we can get help.
-This isn't the moon!

285
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:00,364
What are you going to do,
walk the 38 miles to Bixby?

286
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:05,751
There's Walter's saddle horses.

287
00:28:05,878 --> 00:28:08,334
That's it. You're welcome to them.

288
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,257
Somebody could ride to Bixby.

289
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:14,551
That's not bad.

290
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:16,723
Who's best on a horse?

291
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:29,399
They better be fast.

292
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:31,900
We don't want to be stuck
on a couple of canners.

293
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:36,667
-Those snakes couldn't travel that fast.
-For all you know they could fly.

294
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:40,455
What do you want?
This Colt or Edgar's old rifle?

295
00:28:40,548 --> 00:28:41,461
Rifle.

296
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:50,634
-Here's some Swiss cheese and bullets.
-Thanks.

297
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,351
-You guys all set?
-Ready as we'll ever be.

298
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:04,405
We're going to find that college girl,
tell her to get her ass back into town.

299
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:08,785
Good idea. We'll stop by the doctor's place
and see if they went into Bixby.

300
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:10,157
Wait a minute, guys.

301
00:29:10,253 --> 00:29:13,338
Take something that packs
more of a punch than that .30-.30.

302
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:16,005
Why don't you take
one of our Browning autos?

303
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:18,675
Or better than that. Take my Model 70?

304
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:21,178
lt's .375 ''H and H'' mag.

305
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,185
Thanks, Heather.

306
00:29:23,854 --> 00:29:25,847
l hope we don't need to use it.

307
00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:28,515
lt's got me!

308
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:30,523
lt's got me!

309
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,492
-Grow up!
-Damn it!

310
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,072
-He's only kidding.
-You came that close.

311
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:43,458
Too close. No more games.

312
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:50,096
One of these days
somebody's going to kick your ass.

313
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:30,602
Doctor?

314
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,416
l hate this shit.

315
00:30:53,178 --> 00:30:54,507
Wait a minute.

316
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:58,851
The car's gone.
We just missed 'em, that's all.

317
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:03,894
Where's the goddamn golden oldie
coming from?

318
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,711
-What the hell's this?
-You got me.

319
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:35,896
Here's the plan. We don't even stop.
We ride like hell.

320
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:39,402
Tonight we'll keep right on going.
We'll walk the horses.

321
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:44,235
That is the plan.
What the hell are those things?

322
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:47,662
-How could they bury a station wagon?
-Why would they do it?

323
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:53,666
Come on, git!

324
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:57,752
Walter wouldn't know
a decent horse if it bit him in the ass.

325
00:31:58,137 --> 00:32:01,222
Wait a minute.
They got wind of something they don't like.

326
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:07,607
Something's going on.

327
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:09,768
l don't see anything anywhere!

328
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,868
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. What about my horse?

329
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:27,835
What in the name of--

330
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,224
That's how they get you.
They're under the goddamn ground.

331
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:41,143
-What the hell are they?
-Sons of bitches!

332
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:55,746
Must be a million of 'em!

333
00:32:57,548 --> 00:32:59,173
Nope. Just one.

334
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:05,468
Come on.

335
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:29,421
He's gaining on us!

336
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,838
Look!

337
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,091
We can make it!

338
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:51,861
Stupid son of a bitch.

339
00:33:52,953 --> 00:33:54,613
lt knocked itself cold.

340
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,245
Cold, my ass!

341
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:00,499
He's dead.

342
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:04,212
We killed it.

343
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,716
We killed it!

344
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:09,846
Fuck you!

345
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,729
Hey, guys. What's going on?

346
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,190
Did you notice anything weird
a minute ago?

347
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,898
l mean, it just happened--

348
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:27,027
What's that?

349
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:30,457
All right, together. One, two, three.

350
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,044
Jesus Christ!

351
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:40,426
Does it smell like that 'cause it's dead?

352
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:56,194
l don't see any eyes.

353
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,952
Must be totally subterranean.

354
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:03,490
And those tentacles.

355
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:09,297
You know, l think
they shoot right out of its mouth...

356
00:35:10,303 --> 00:35:13,305
...and they hook you and pull you right in.

357
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,680
Good thing we stopped it
before it killed anybody else.

358
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,012
This is important, you know.

359
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:20,929
This is like...

360
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:22,687
...well, let's just say it.

361
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:26,194
This is probably the biggest
zoological discovery of the century.

362
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,535
Check this out.

363
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:34,290
l found the ass end.

364
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:38,244
Jesus, we really caught something here.

365
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:45,843
-Wow!
-Man!

366
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:48,517
That's one big mother.

367
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:52,773
This must be the old boy
had your seismos working overtime.

368
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,939
lt must push itself along with these.

369
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,235
All of them pushing at once.

370
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:04,823
That's why it moved so fast.

371
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:09,456
This thing had sensors tripping
all over the place. No--

372
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:12,038
Rhonda, you ever heard
of anything like this?

373
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:15,135
Everybody knows about 'em.
We just didn't tell you.

374
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,385
Hell, man,
no one ever saw anything like this!

375
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:20,267
We're really onto something.

376
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,479
l'll tell you, old Chang don't get
his slick mitts on this for no measly $15.

377
00:36:25,943 --> 00:36:27,318
You got that right.

378
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:30,186
All right, here's the plan.
We need a flatbed--

379
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:32,690
-Right, with a winch.
-A five-ton maybe.

380
00:36:33,578 --> 00:36:36,248
No, don't want a winch. lt'd tear it all up.

381
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:38,905
-A crane?
-Yeah, a crane with lifting straps.

382
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,164
Shut up.

383
00:36:41,505 --> 00:36:44,293
-There are three more of these things.
-What?

384
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:47,049
Three more?

385
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:50,304
l've got seismographs all over the valley.
Compare the readings.

386
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:52,135
Here's one at 2:00 yesterday.

387
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,598
But here's one three miles away
at the exact time. That's two.

388
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:57,647
-But here--
-We'll take your word.

389
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:00,486
-Yeah, where's your truck?
-Just beyond that hill.

390
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,029
What?

391
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:17,252
-Damn prairie dog burrow.
-Little sons of bitches.

392
00:37:30,234 --> 00:37:31,314
This way!

393
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:35,907
Up on that rock!

394
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:52,468
Looks like the one that got our truck.

395
00:37:52,555 --> 00:37:55,391
-Where the hell's your truck?
-Right over there.

396
00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:58,093
l don't think we can make that.

397
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:01,936
At least he can't climb.

398
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:11,826
Live ones smell worse than the dead ones.

399
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:32,892
l got it.

400
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:35,564
They're mutations caused by radiation.

401
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:37,226
Or no.

402
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:41,073
The government built 'em.
Big surprise for the Russians.

403
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:44,870
There's nothing like them
in the fossil record. l'm sure.

404
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,874
Okay, so, they predate the fossil record.

405
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,092
That would make 'em
a couple billion years old.

406
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:56,793
And we've just never seen one 'til now.

407
00:38:57,514 --> 00:38:58,463
Right.

408
00:38:58,682 --> 00:39:02,183
l vote for outer space.
No way these are local boys.

409
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:09,778
Well, haven't seen a sign for hours.

410
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,576
Must be long gone.

411
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:15,114
Yeah, must be.

412
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,244
Why don't you take
a little stroll and find out?

413
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:24,715
We've got to do something.

414
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:37,314
''We've got to do something.''

415
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:40,983
l don't know why ''we''
always has to be ''me'' every damn time.

416
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:45,826
We, we, we. What do l look like?
An expert on worms?

417
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,319
Watch it, it's got a good six-foot reach.

418
00:39:48,414 --> 00:39:49,789
Thank you, Earl.

419
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,457
Son of a bitch!

420
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:59,250
Son of a goddamn bitch!
Pardon my French.

421
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:04,761
Shit! lt's been waiting here all this time?
How's it know we're still here?

422
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,771
lt's got no eyes, right?
Sure as hell can't smell us underground.

423
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,058
lt's been listening.

424
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:14,227
Of course!

425
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:17,237
lt senses seismic vibration.

426
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:21,532
lt can hear every move we make
on this rock. lt's a perfect conductor!

427
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:24,489
That means we're stuck.
That pisses me off!

428
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,091
l hate to be crude,
but l've got to take care of business.

429
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,894
-Me, too.
-Same here.

430
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:11,015
Thanks.

431
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:14,933
No problem. Anytime.

432
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,666
Well, what's the plan?

433
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:33,543
The first thing we've got to do
is see if old Stumpy's still out there.

434
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:38,380
-Can l borrow that shovel?
-Yeah.

435
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:49,853
Doesn't he have a home to go to?

436
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,700
That's why Edgar never got down
off that damn tower.

437
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:53,982
l have an idea.

438
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:58,656
You know, we have to come up with a plan
or he's going to wait us to death.

439
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:02,043
-l was thinking--
-Why not run? We outran him yesterday.

440
00:42:02,129 --> 00:42:06,210
Run for it? Running's not a plan.
Running's what you do when a plan fails.

441
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:08,341
You're not trying to think of a plan.

442
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,885
lt ain't like we got a hell of a lot of options.

443
00:42:10,973 --> 00:42:14,094
There's always options.
We've just got to think of them.

444
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:15,930
Why don't you start thinking?

445
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,473
Why do l always
have to do all the thinking?

446
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:22,067
-Who died and made you Einstein?
-You know how to pole vault?

447
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:29,620
We just stay where he can't get us...

448
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:34,869
...on these residual boulders.
My truck's parked next to one.

449
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:49,480
Stay on those residual boulders!

450
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:55,937
That Tammy Lynn Baxter,
she do much pole vaulting?

451
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,515
That's pretty good.

452
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:43,717
That slimebag won't give us much time
once we hit that truck.

453
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:46,218
-l say we all jump together.
-Right.

454
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:47,837
Wait.

455
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,103
Okay, ready.

456
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:55,518
One, two, three!

457
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:05,245
Go!

458
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:09,324
Watch it, Val!

459
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:14,674
Move!

460
00:44:25,815 --> 00:44:28,817
Can somebody, perhaps, help me?

461
00:44:30,821 --> 00:44:32,067
No!

462
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:36,025
The snake things are just their tongues.
These animals are huge!

463
00:44:36,162 --> 00:44:39,199
l'm sorry.
l'm having a real difficult time with this.

464
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:43,454
Come on, you guys, answer.

465
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:46,383
-Where's Burt and Heather?
-l can't reach them.

466
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,675
l guess they're still driving around.

467
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:52,468
What's the name you call those things?

468
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,343
Where do they come from?

469
00:44:55,311 --> 00:44:57,934
-l don't know.
-You're a scientist, aren't you?

470
00:44:58,023 --> 00:45:00,016
Aren't you supposed to have a theory?

471
00:45:01,194 --> 00:45:03,602
These creatures
are absolutely unprecedented.

472
00:45:03,906 --> 00:45:05,983
But where do they come from?

473
00:45:06,075 --> 00:45:07,107
Yeah!

474
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:11,114
lt doesn't matter where they come from.

475
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,000
No name.

476
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,953
We discovered them,
we should name them!

477
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:19,919
Forget the damn name!

478
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:23,337
Now me and Earl need to get
out of this valley.

479
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,715
Hang on. Let's not go off half-cocked.

480
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:30,473
Somebody's bound to come check on us
once they see the road is out...

481
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:33,318
-...and the lines are down.
-That's how it works.

482
00:45:54,513 --> 00:45:59,307
-''Suckoids.''
-''Oids.'' l like ''snakeoids.''

483
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:03,144
One of them comes near me
and l'll hit him with a five-pound pickax.

484
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:06,645
You don't understand. They come up
from the ground and grab you.

485
00:46:06,737 --> 00:46:09,407
They sense the slightest vibration
through the ground.

486
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:12,161
Even footsteps. That's how they hunt.

487
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,656
So we don't vibrate, right?

488
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:18,624
Maybe they won't even come through here.

489
00:46:19,003 --> 00:46:20,628
Maybe they'll leave us alone!

490
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:23,290
Chain saw. That's what l'll use.

491
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,625
Wake up!

492
00:46:26,054 --> 00:46:27,383
Now, look!

493
00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:34,437
They're headed right for us!

494
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:37,812
They trapped Edgar here.
Grabbed old Fred right here.

495
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:41,736
Nailed those two poor suckers on the road
and the doctor's place is here!

496
00:46:42,283 --> 00:46:45,155
This valley is just one long smorgasbord.

497
00:46:45,538 --> 00:46:48,575
We have got to get out.

498
00:46:51,754 --> 00:46:53,297
l'm going to get Mindy.

499
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:56,051
She's okay.
l saw her playing down the street.

500
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,379
That's what l like, ''Graboids''!
That's it, ''graboids''!

501
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:02,308
Jesus, Walter.

502
00:47:02,476 --> 00:47:04,885
We're going to be sorry
if we don't give it a name.

503
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:09,098
Okay, you say let's get out of here.
Where are we supposed to go?

504
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:13,438
Rhonda's got an idea about that.

505
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:17,235
See, they move very easily
through the Pleistocene alluvials.

506
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:23,750
The dirt. The loose soil
that covers the valley floor.

507
00:47:23,837 --> 00:47:25,629
But they can't move through rock.

508
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,376
-We should go west to the mountains.
-She means up the old Jeep trail.

509
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,759
lf those mountains are granite
we'd be safe.

510
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,256
We could hike along them to Bixby if we--

511
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,182
l scared you, didn't l?

512
00:47:40,818 --> 00:47:42,443
You little ass wipe.

513
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:46,230
You don't knock it off,
you're going to be shitting this basketball.

514
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:50,079
Pardon my French.

515
00:48:00,134 --> 00:48:03,220
lt's going to take us days
to get back with help with Nestor.

516
00:48:03,305 --> 00:48:05,548
We're not going to leave you alone.

517
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:12,893
-Damn it! l'm going to kick his ass!
-l'm going to help you.

518
00:48:17,448 --> 00:48:19,572
Where is that little shit stain?

519
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,500
Melvin, get your--

520
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:31,211
Get inside!

521
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,528
-Run! Come on!
-Come on, get in!

522
00:48:50,616 --> 00:48:53,322
-Walter, you got a gun?
-No!

523
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:56,576
-What are we going to do?
-Be quiet!

524
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,082
Where is he?

525
00:49:19,738 --> 00:49:24,531
Now remember, no noise, no vibrations.

526
00:49:34,715 --> 00:49:36,507
No, Mindy.

527
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:37,792
Stop.

528
00:49:37,886 --> 00:49:39,844
Mindy, get off the pogo stick.

529
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:46,805
-Get her, Val!
-Mindy, come back!

530
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,623
Be quiet. Don't move.

531
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:06,539
Mindy, get back.

532
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:09,841
Run! Get in the house!

533
00:50:19,231 --> 00:50:21,355
Get him off or it'll suck that truck down.

534
00:50:23,278 --> 00:50:25,022
Go back, for Chrissake!

535
00:50:27,742 --> 00:50:29,451
Jesus, here comes another one!

536
00:50:31,497 --> 00:50:33,325
Run! Come on!

537
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:31,282
Get out of your pants!

538
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,205
Look out!

539
00:51:52,352 --> 00:51:53,218
Run!

540
00:51:58,694 --> 00:52:00,651
Don't look back. Come on!

541
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,541
Sorry.

542
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:43,328
-Rhonda, here.
-Thank you.

543
00:52:45,212 --> 00:52:49,211
What are we going to do?
How long 'til they go away?

544
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:52,092
They got the patience of Job.

545
00:52:53,098 --> 00:52:56,799
They sit and wait until they hear
something that sounds like lunch.

546
00:52:57,019 --> 00:52:59,772
-We've got to have a plan.
-l got a plan.

547
00:52:59,898 --> 00:53:04,395
You drive the truck up to the mountain,
walk to Bixby, get some help.

548
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:08,658
-Those scumsuckers ate our radials.
-You can take my truck.

549
00:53:09,243 --> 00:53:13,159
No, we need a major four-wheel drive
just to get up that Jeep trail.

550
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:15,744
That trail's all messed up.

551
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,833
Turn it off!

552
00:53:22,511 --> 00:53:23,460
Pull it back!

553
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:30,640
l got it.

554
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,162
Give me your hand!

555
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:57,512
Son of a bitch.

556
00:53:58,933 --> 00:54:00,475
Son of a bitch!

557
00:54:16,873 --> 00:54:18,747
Come on, let's go! The roof!

558
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,143
Come on!

559
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,658
-Jump! You can do it!
-l can't!

560
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:57,294
Don't stop. Keep moving!

561
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,139
Oh, my God.

562
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:11,724
You okay?

563
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:17,404
What's going on? Where are you guys?

564
00:55:18,035 --> 00:55:21,037
What's up?
What the hell are you doing up there?

565
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,247
Shut the hell up.

566
00:55:23,376 --> 00:55:25,250
-Get up on your roof.
-No way!

567
00:55:47,782 --> 00:55:50,452
Nancy, get up on your roofs.

568
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:53,864
Up on your roofs!
They come through the floor.

569
00:56:05,722 --> 00:56:08,131
l don't know. l can't believe it.

570
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:10,514
No tracks.

571
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,639
No sign. No spoor.

572
00:56:14,692 --> 00:56:18,643
You'd think after eating all those sheep
they'd have to take a dump someplace.

573
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:20,863
Yeah. l don't understand it.

574
00:56:41,477 --> 00:56:44,147
<i>Walter, this is Burt. Come back</i>.

575
00:56:46,692 --> 00:56:49,314
<i>Walter? Anybody copy?</i>

576
00:56:51,031 --> 00:56:52,526
<i>l'm waiting</i>.

577
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:56,160
<i>-Walter, you there? Come back!</i>
-Okay, l got it.

578
00:57:05,758 --> 00:57:08,167
<i>Who's minding the store, for God's sake?</i>

579
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,255
Burt, listen.
We found out what's been killing people.

580
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,433
-Say ''over.''
-Over.

581
00:57:14,645 --> 00:57:18,181
Negative copy on that, Walter.
Check your frequency.

582
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,518
l'm on 22. Come back.

583
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:24,490
<i>Burt, can you hear me now? Over</i>.

584
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,948
ls that you?
What're you doing back already?

585
00:57:27,036 --> 00:57:29,243
Something real weird's going on
over there.

586
00:57:29,331 --> 00:57:30,956
They're up on top of the roof.

587
00:57:48,188 --> 00:57:50,431
l think they're going for Burt's.

588
00:57:53,946 --> 00:57:55,904
Man! They're going!

589
00:57:56,658 --> 00:57:59,778
Burt, get out of your basement.
Take your radio.

590
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:03,412
You and Heather get up on your roof.
We'll talk later. Over.

591
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,123
Up on the roof?
What are you talking about?

592
00:58:06,212 --> 00:58:08,882
Damn it, Burt. Listen to him.
Something's wrong.

593
00:58:09,716 --> 00:58:11,092
<i>Burt, Jesus Christ!</i>

594
00:58:11,427 --> 00:58:13,385
Get up on your roof! The things!

595
00:58:13,471 --> 00:58:16,343
<i>They're under the ground</i>.
<i>They're bigger than we thought</i>.

596
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:19,886
<i>They're huge. They're coming after you</i>.
<i>They're coming right now!</i>

597
00:58:37,169 --> 00:58:40,788
We don't see anything. What the hell
are you talking about? Over.

598
00:58:41,424 --> 00:58:44,379
They're under the ground!

599
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:48,219
<i>They can dig. Big monsters!</i>
<i>Underground! Now get out!</i>

600
00:58:48,308 --> 00:58:49,553
<i>Hurry!</i>

601
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:12,208
<i>Jesus--</i>

602
00:59:52,141 --> 00:59:53,635
Burt, come on.

603
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,275
Magazine!

604
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:28,604
Here!

605
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:18,746
Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room,
didn't you, you bastard?

606
01:01:20,672 --> 01:01:24,588
<i>We killed it! You got that?</i>
<i>We killed that motherhumper! Come back</i>.

607
01:01:26,138 --> 01:01:29,223
Roger that, Burt. And congratulations.

608
01:01:29,308 --> 01:01:33,473
Be advised, however, there are two more.
Repeat, two more motherhumpers.

609
01:01:46,205 --> 01:01:47,914
Burt got one! He killed one!

610
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:51,708
-Way to go, dude!
-All right!

611
01:01:57,178 --> 01:02:00,464
l guess we don't get to make fun
of Burt's lifestyle anymore.

612
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:01,673
Say, Burt?

613
01:02:01,976 --> 01:02:04,681
<i>Any chance you can get the other two?</i>
<i>Come back</i>.

614
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:07,600
One second, pal.

615
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,408
You didn't get penetration
even with the elephant gun.

616
01:02:21,209 --> 01:02:22,620
Good Lord!

617
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:30,758
<i>We can't get 'em</i>.

618
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,589
<i>l never figured</i>
<i>on having to shoot through dirt</i>.

619
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:36,555
<i>The best goddamn bullet stop there is</i>.
<i>Come back</i>.

620
01:02:38,398 --> 01:02:39,643
Let me see that.

621
01:02:41,193 --> 01:02:44,480
Forget shooting them.
Can you get to your truck?

622
01:02:44,823 --> 01:02:46,021
<i>-Over</i>.
-No problem.

623
01:02:46,116 --> 01:02:48,952
<i>You have the only truck</i>
<i>that can get up that Jeep trail</i>.

624
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:50,996
Now listen. Here's the plan.

625
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:53,999
You and Heather go for help.
You get to the mountains and--

626
01:02:54,085 --> 01:02:55,877
You guys!

627
01:02:57,047 --> 01:02:58,756
-Come over.
-Hang on a sec.

628
01:03:00,468 --> 01:03:04,052
-He's up to something.
-lf it isn't our old pal Stumpy.

629
01:03:04,557 --> 01:03:05,672
Bastard.

630
01:03:14,028 --> 01:03:16,353
What do you think it's trying to do?

631
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:18,816
Why do you keep asking me?

632
01:03:44,442 --> 01:03:45,818
What the hell was that?

633
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:49,775
<i>Breaker there, Earl</i>.
<i>What did you want us to do?</i>

634
01:03:49,907 --> 01:03:50,939
<i>Come back</i>.

635
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:55,114
Hang on, Burt.
This bastard's trying something new.

636
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,365
Over.

637
01:04:13,688 --> 01:04:17,687
They wasn't making no noise.
Why is he bothering them?

638
01:04:17,902 --> 01:04:21,070
lt's like it's studying the buildings,
trying to figure them out.

639
01:04:21,448 --> 01:04:24,569
They can feel our vibrations
but they can't find us.

640
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:27,236
Looks to me
like they're coming up with a plan.

641
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,000
Watch it, Nestor!

642
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:50,191
Shit! Enough!

643
01:04:57,203 --> 01:05:01,416
-Get off the ground! Get moving!
-Get out of there!

644
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:03,533
Move it!

645
01:05:04,963 --> 01:05:08,131
No, that's no good!
You've got to get higher!

646
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:21,433
No way!

647
01:05:22,402 --> 01:05:25,108
No! You guys have got to do something!

648
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:28,692
You've got to do something!

649
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,992
<i>Burt? Heather?</i>

650
01:05:37,797 --> 01:05:39,956
You got us. Come on back. Over.

651
01:05:40,634 --> 01:05:44,051
<i>We're in deep shit over here</i>.
<i>We'll have to change that plan</i>.

652
01:05:46,851 --> 01:05:49,342
-Burt, cut it out!
-l think l scared him.

653
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:51,189
<i>No use going for help</i>.

654
01:05:51,899 --> 01:05:54,473
<i>We'd be dead</i>
<i>long before you'd ever get back</i>.

655
01:05:55,153 --> 01:05:57,561
<i>We're with you</i>.
<i>Tell us what you want to do</i>.

656
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,275
This one's going to tear this town
out from under us.

657
01:06:01,369 --> 01:06:03,695
We're going to have to
get out of here together...

658
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:05,581
-...<i>now</i>.
-Okay.

659
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:08,704
We're coming after everybody.
Just hang tight. Over.

660
01:06:34,162 --> 01:06:36,451
<i>You're going to have to</i>
<i>forget about the truck</i>.

661
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:38,576
Yeah, we've got you, Heather.

662
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:43,792
The situation hasn't changed.

663
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,336
We still have to make it to solid rock.
There's got to be a way.

664
01:06:47,638 --> 01:06:51,589
Like what? There's nothing left
that can make it to those mountains.

665
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,058
Quiet, man.

666
01:06:56,649 --> 01:06:58,975
lt doesn't matter now.
They know we're here.

667
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:03,273
We need a helicopter. Or a goddamn tank!

668
01:07:03,617 --> 01:07:07,069
Wait a minute. The Cat!

669
01:07:07,372 --> 01:07:10,658
-Could we take the Cat?
-Jesus. lt's slower than hell.

670
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:14,544
But it weighs more than 30 tons.
There's no way they could lift that.

671
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:18,500
-Could they? l mean--
-But we can't all fit on the bulldozer.

672
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:24,511
No, but we could...

673
01:07:24,894 --> 01:07:29,356
...drag something, though.
We could pull a car behind it. l don't know.

674
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,399
Hell, that old semitrailer.

675
01:07:33,072 --> 01:07:35,148
-lts tires are flat.
-Doesn't matter.

676
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:37,193
That Cat can pull anything.

677
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:42,367
-We just roll on out of here.
-We've got a plan!

678
01:07:47,424 --> 01:07:50,260
Of course, that's a hell of a long walk.

679
01:07:51,596 --> 01:07:54,004
They only respond to vibration, right?

680
01:07:54,182 --> 01:07:56,757
Couldn't we distract them somehow?

681
01:07:58,313 --> 01:08:01,897
Good. Something to keep 'em busy.
Like a decoy.

682
01:08:03,361 --> 01:08:05,687
Melvin, you want to make a buck?

683
01:08:06,365 --> 01:08:07,279
Eat it!

684
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:11,116
How about Walter's little tractor?
Start him up.

685
01:08:11,622 --> 01:08:13,330
Let him go out by himself.

686
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:16,583
Let those things follow him all over
if they like that noise.

687
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:19,997
Not bad. What do you think?

688
01:08:33,024 --> 01:08:36,359
Ground's getting closer.
l say we go with Miguel's plan.

689
01:09:04,065 --> 01:09:05,476
Hold on, Nancy!

690
01:09:05,567 --> 01:09:07,856
-l'm making the run for the Cat.
-Like hell.

691
01:09:07,945 --> 01:09:10,697
-l'm faster than you.
-But l'm best at driving the Cat.

692
01:09:10,782 --> 01:09:14,697
-Not while l'm around.
-Listen to me. l'm older and wiser.

693
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,662
Well you're half right.

694
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,295
Damn! l lost. Guess l'll have to do it.

695
01:09:23,882 --> 01:09:25,591
l won. l pick who does it.

696
01:09:26,552 --> 01:09:28,177
Ready when you are, Miguel.

697
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:46,065
There he is. There he goes!

698
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:47,407
He's chasing it!

699
01:09:52,961 --> 01:09:56,047
lt's going. This one's going, too!

700
01:09:57,634 --> 01:10:00,921
-Good luck, shithead.
-Don't worry about me, jerk-off.

701
01:10:11,611 --> 01:10:14,696
You suicidal son of a bitch.

702
01:10:30,677 --> 01:10:31,958
Keep going!

703
01:10:40,231 --> 01:10:41,774
Oh, my God.

704
01:10:45,363 --> 01:10:46,193
Come on!

705
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,118
They're going to get him!

706
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:54,915
Val, stop! They're coming! Be quiet!

707
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,199
Don't move!

708
01:11:06,974 --> 01:11:09,644
lt worked. They can't find him.

709
01:11:17,488 --> 01:11:18,733
We've got to...

710
01:11:20,074 --> 01:11:21,866
...make some noise.

711
01:11:22,327 --> 01:11:23,738
A lot of noise!

712
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:27,830
You sorry sons of bitches.
Come and get my ass!

713
01:11:27,918 --> 01:11:31,584
Over here, you slime bucket!
Come get me!

714
01:11:42,478 --> 01:11:44,637
What are you, scared? Come on.

715
01:11:57,164 --> 01:11:58,363
What's she doing?

716
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:14,804
That did it, girl! Goddamn good thinking.

717
01:13:41,257 --> 01:13:42,835
-You okay?
-Yeah.

718
01:13:48,392 --> 01:13:49,305
Here goes.

719
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:01,397
-Here.
-Yeah.

720
01:14:20,725 --> 01:14:23,846
Goddamn! Armored transport.

721
01:14:26,107 --> 01:14:28,100
Let's get going!

722
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:33,448
Come on, let's go, you two.
We're headed for the mountains.

723
01:14:33,617 --> 01:14:36,191
lf that's how we're doing it,
we're going prepared.

724
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:39,699
We can't hold still long.
These things are damn smart.

725
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:42,366
-They're getting smarter by the minute.
-Fine.

726
01:14:42,754 --> 01:14:44,830
We've got some new things to teach 'em.

727
01:14:58,649 --> 01:14:59,895
You see that?

728
01:15:00,277 --> 01:15:03,611
They're doing it again.
They try it every time we stop!

729
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,073
Jesus Christ! We're only going nine miles.

730
01:15:08,412 --> 01:15:11,829
Those things will be on our ass
every foot of the way, right?

731
01:15:11,917 --> 01:15:15,334
-Just hurry!
-What are you doing up there?

732
01:15:15,421 --> 01:15:17,995
-Can't you see we are sinking.
-Get in the trailer!

733
01:15:18,091 --> 01:15:20,665
What do you think? Max firepower or this?

734
01:15:20,761 --> 01:15:25,010
l go for penetration. The .458,
shooting solids. Less ammo to carry.

735
01:15:25,184 --> 01:15:26,844
Come on. Move it!

736
01:15:27,854 --> 01:15:29,598
Watch these ammo boxes!

737
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:32,599
-Come on, Burt!
-Heather, hurry!

738
01:15:33,152 --> 01:15:35,276
-Tell 'em to come on!
-Okay, now!

739
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,488
Now! Come on!

740
01:15:43,499 --> 01:15:45,124
Give me a gun. l'll take one.

741
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:48,295
l wouldn't give you a gun
if it was World War lll.

742
01:16:07,071 --> 01:16:09,646
Food for five years.

743
01:16:10,534 --> 01:16:14,580
1,000 gallons of gas,
air and water filtration, Geiger counter...

744
01:16:14,957 --> 01:16:16,617
...bomb shelter.

745
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:22,755
Underground. Goddamn monsters!

746
01:16:35,817 --> 01:16:38,523
There we go! Fallen Rock.

747
01:16:46,247 --> 01:16:47,825
Any sign of them?

748
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,951
Maybe they just gave up, you know?

749
01:16:54,508 --> 01:16:55,623
What's that?

750
01:16:57,762 --> 01:17:00,336
Damn it! What the hell are they doing?

751
01:17:00,432 --> 01:17:04,763
l don't care what they're doing
as long as they're doing it way over there.

752
01:17:11,572 --> 01:17:13,280
Wait! Look out!

753
01:17:21,835 --> 01:17:23,496
-Burt, you okay?
-l'm okay.

754
01:17:23,587 --> 01:17:25,711
Are they going to get us? What happened?

755
01:17:27,759 --> 01:17:30,430
-Burt, you sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

756
01:17:32,057 --> 01:17:33,516
What happened?

757
01:17:34,435 --> 01:17:36,013
They dug a trap.

758
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:38,015
l can't believe this.

759
01:17:40,025 --> 01:17:41,306
All right.

760
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:43,144
Here.

761
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,084
Let me have my gun.

762
01:18:02,847 --> 01:18:05,303
Hungry? Eat this!

763
01:18:05,934 --> 01:18:07,642
Everybody down!

764
01:18:17,157 --> 01:18:18,153
There they are!

765
01:18:18,909 --> 01:18:20,902
-Did you kill one?
-l don't know.

766
01:18:21,204 --> 01:18:22,782
No, there's still two of them.

767
01:18:22,873 --> 01:18:26,077
-There're two different dust trails.
-Made them think twice.

768
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,497
What's in those?

769
01:18:27,587 --> 01:18:30,209
A few household chemicals
in the proper proportion.

770
01:18:35,556 --> 01:18:37,632
Here they come. They're coming back!

771
01:18:45,443 --> 01:18:47,650
We'll have to make a run for those rocks.

772
01:18:47,822 --> 01:18:51,026
-l don't know. That's a long way.
-They'll get us!

773
01:18:51,117 --> 01:18:53,740
They're going to get us if we stay here.

774
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,701
-You have any more of those bombs?
-We've got you covered.

775
01:18:57,793 --> 01:19:02,041
What if we throw one that way, the way
we want to go? Then when it explodes...

776
01:19:02,173 --> 01:19:05,341
...if it drives them away,
we run like goddamn bastards.

777
01:19:06,262 --> 01:19:07,377
Pardon my French.

778
01:19:08,974 --> 01:19:11,810
What if they don't get scared?
What if they don't run?

779
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,012
l don't think it does scare them.
lt hurts them.

780
01:19:15,107 --> 01:19:17,314
They're sensitive to sound, they'll run.

781
01:19:17,402 --> 01:19:19,062
Hell, she's got my vote!

782
01:19:19,196 --> 01:19:21,818
That's it! We're making a run for it!

783
01:19:21,907 --> 01:19:25,075
-We're going for the rocks.
-l don't know. They're too fast.

784
01:19:25,162 --> 01:19:29,741
-You can't out run 'em. No way!
-This'll make 'em think twice.

785
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:33,002
Everybody ready to run?

786
01:19:38,929 --> 01:19:40,554
Heads down!

787
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,942
lt worked! There they go!

788
01:19:51,237 --> 01:19:52,400
Let's go!

789
01:19:58,663 --> 01:20:00,039
Come on, Burt.

790
01:20:05,506 --> 01:20:06,965
You asshole!

791
01:20:12,723 --> 01:20:13,969
Get up.

792
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:24,526
-Get up here!
-l'm with you, honey.

793
01:20:25,365 --> 01:20:26,990
Go!

794
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,830
You asshole!
There are no bullets in this gun.

795
01:20:37,589 --> 01:20:39,381
Got you moving, didn't it?

796
01:21:08,963 --> 01:21:10,457
So now what?

797
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:14,711
Could we make it to the mountains?
Use Burt's explosives?

798
01:21:14,929 --> 01:21:16,092
No way.

799
01:21:16,765 --> 01:21:18,557
We'd need 50 of those bombs.

800
01:21:19,143 --> 01:21:20,258
That's it.

801
01:21:21,437 --> 01:21:23,146
We're not getting off this rock.

802
01:21:25,568 --> 01:21:29,234
We're not going to pole vault out of here.
That's for damn sure.

803
01:21:29,948 --> 01:21:33,069
Wait a minute. What're you talking about?

804
01:21:33,662 --> 01:21:35,405
lt's like you're giving up.

805
01:21:35,497 --> 01:21:39,745
They'll wait out there 'til we're dead.
That's exactly what they do.

806
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:42,376
Wait!

807
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:47,963
For Chrissake, we could've made a stand
at our place. We had food, water....

808
01:21:48,306 --> 01:21:49,966
You can't fight 'em like that.

809
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:53,095
So you two screw-ups
hauled us way the hell out here?

810
01:21:57,985 --> 01:22:02,529
Why don't you just back off, string bean?
We could've left your ass on the roof!

811
01:22:02,616 --> 01:22:05,820
l wish you had, fearless leader.
Who put you two in charge?

812
01:22:05,912 --> 01:22:08,154
Don't push me!

813
01:22:11,252 --> 01:22:13,411
lf them graboids don't kill him, l will.

814
01:22:13,839 --> 01:22:14,752
What?

815
01:22:15,841 --> 01:22:18,333
They'd have torn up your place
in half an hour.

816
01:22:18,428 --> 01:22:21,845
Come on. Just let it go. Forget about it.

817
01:22:23,268 --> 01:22:25,890
l know he does.
He thinks he knows everything.

818
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:41,078
lf it comes to starvation,
l know what l'm doing.

819
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:44,252
Take one of these...

820
01:22:45,129 --> 01:22:49,543
...walk right out there with the fuse lit
and let 'em take me down.

821
01:22:55,726 --> 01:22:57,351
Good Lord, honey.

822
01:22:59,231 --> 01:23:00,891
Now that's not a bad idea.

823
01:23:02,443 --> 01:23:04,401
No. lt gives me an idea.

824
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:06,227
Going fishing.

825
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,537
There's one. Straight out in front.

826
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,207
Let's see if we can keep him right there.

827
01:23:16,461 --> 01:23:19,380
-How much we need?
-l don't know. They're pretty quick.

828
01:23:19,674 --> 01:23:21,085
Fifteen seconds at least.

829
01:23:23,554 --> 01:23:26,224
-Which kind of fuse is that?
-Cannon fuse.

830
01:23:26,308 --> 01:23:29,262
-What the hell you use if for?
-My cannon.

831
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:31,805
You guys watch yourselves.

832
01:23:35,027 --> 01:23:37,067
Right out there, about 30--

833
01:23:37,405 --> 01:23:41,487
-You're not going do your lasso thing?
-Just 'cause you're no good with a rope.

834
01:23:46,417 --> 01:23:47,912
All right, get back!

835
01:23:57,765 --> 01:23:58,963
Come on, baby.

836
01:23:59,559 --> 01:24:01,517
Take it. Take the bait!

837
01:24:07,528 --> 01:24:09,236
Yeah! All right!

838
01:24:14,036 --> 01:24:15,151
Look at it!

839
01:24:34,855 --> 01:24:36,682
Okay, one to go.

840
01:24:38,276 --> 01:24:40,234
Damn! Where the hell is he?

841
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:43,524
Hope he didn't wise up.

842
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:47,651
There.

843
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:50,035
Look who it is.

844
01:24:51,126 --> 01:24:52,751
Give me that thing.

845
01:24:53,295 --> 01:24:55,170
This son of a bitch is mine.

846
01:24:58,552 --> 01:24:59,928
There it goes!

847
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:02,299
-All right, get back!
-l got it.

848
01:25:02,474 --> 01:25:03,672
Come on.

849
01:25:16,868 --> 01:25:18,825
Come on. Lunchtime, slophead.

850
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,458
All right, get down!

851
01:25:31,011 --> 01:25:32,506
Oh, my God! lt's coming--

852
01:25:32,638 --> 01:25:34,263
Get back! Run!

853
01:25:36,101 --> 01:25:37,180
Get up, come on!

854
01:25:53,332 --> 01:25:55,325
What're you doing out there?

855
01:26:10,562 --> 01:26:14,347
Okay, let's make some noise.
Try to distract them.

856
01:26:29,712 --> 01:26:30,875
Fresh meat!

857
01:26:45,107 --> 01:26:46,388
Wait.

858
01:26:49,154 --> 01:26:51,277
This one's not falling for it.

859
01:26:53,284 --> 01:26:54,909
This one ain't dumb.

860
01:26:56,121 --> 01:26:57,865
He's trying to trick us.

861
01:27:00,001 --> 01:27:01,496
Use your bomb.

862
01:27:02,129 --> 01:27:04,169
lt's our last one.

863
01:27:05,592 --> 01:27:07,300
What else you going use it for?

864
01:27:08,888 --> 01:27:13,017
So what if we make it to the rocks.
We'll be dead in three days anyway.

865
01:27:13,602 --> 01:27:15,679
l want to live for the three days.

866
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,689
What the hell? What's the matter?

867
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:21,025
-Use the bomb, for God's sake!
-Throw that bomb, man!

868
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:23,272
Scare 'em away!

869
01:27:24,074 --> 01:27:25,818
Throw the bomb!

870
01:27:29,498 --> 01:27:31,705
This bastard ain't smarter than us.

871
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:35,037
For Chrissake, Val!

872
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:37,580
-l'm going to go for it.
-Go for what?

873
01:27:49,691 --> 01:27:53,025
-What are you doing?
-l got a goddamn plan!

874
01:27:56,241 --> 01:27:57,486
Where the hell is it?

875
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:03,201
l've got it!

876
01:28:08,674 --> 01:28:11,212
This better be one hell of a great plan!

877
01:28:18,895 --> 01:28:19,975
Get ready!

878
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,933
-Light it, man!
-Not yet.

879
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:24,985
What are you waiting for?

880
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:27,603
Go!

881
01:28:28,866 --> 01:28:30,195
Come on!

882
01:28:32,663 --> 01:28:34,870
Too far! You threw it behind him.

883
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:43,714
Run!

884
01:28:51,271 --> 01:28:53,430
Can you fly, you sucker?

885
01:29:23,604 --> 01:29:26,392
lt just suddenly hit me, you know.

886
01:29:27,192 --> 01:29:28,735
Stampede.

887
01:29:45,716 --> 01:29:46,796
Now...

888
01:29:47,468 --> 01:29:50,470
...the second we hit Bixby,
we start making phone calls.

889
01:29:50,597 --> 01:29:53,220
We could make some real money
on this thing.

890
01:29:53,309 --> 01:29:55,682
We could get in <i>People</i> magazine.

891
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:58,726
<i>People</i>? Hell! National Geographic.

892
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:04,986
Smile.

893
01:30:16,923 --> 01:30:18,751
Burt loaned me his camera.

894
01:30:19,009 --> 01:30:21,252
Yeah. He gave us these tires, too.

895
01:30:26,519 --> 01:30:28,429
lt's all pretty exciting, huh?

896
01:30:29,523 --> 01:30:32,727
There's going to be research,
and l'm going to be in on it.

897
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:37,529
The first thing to do
is take pictures of that one we dug up.

898
01:30:38,535 --> 01:30:42,403
Yeah. Pictures seem like a good idea.

899
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:48,628
Thanks for everything.
Saving my life and stuff.

900
01:30:51,969 --> 01:30:53,463
You're welcome.

901
01:30:55,473 --> 01:30:57,348
Maybe l'll see you sometime?

902
01:31:10,618 --> 01:31:11,697
See ya.

903
01:31:17,794 --> 01:31:21,045
l know! l'm working up to it.

904
01:31:21,757 --> 01:31:23,086
What am l doing?

905
01:31:23,343 --> 01:31:26,298
What's a woman like her want
with a guy like me?

906
01:31:26,388 --> 01:31:28,382
She's going for her damn Ph.D.

907
01:31:33,564 --> 01:31:34,560
Yeah?

908
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,559
l just wanted to....

909
01:31:38,305 --> 01:31:44,464
