1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,329
Get off me!

2
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,498
Oh, please.

3
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:08,000
Please, don't hurt me.

4
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:14,349
It's wrong! She's too young!

5
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:17,176
The sins of the flesh will ruin her.

6
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:23,020
Please don't hurt me!

7
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,690
Please!

8
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,771
The wicked will be punished.

9
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:22,163
"The mystery heart condition that has
killed over 30 people in 4 years...

10
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,956
has claimed another victim.

11
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:28,006
Doctors are baffled as to why
fit and healthy people...

12
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,508
are suffering massive heart attacks.

13
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:34,138
Many residents claim that
the 'Shadow of Death'...

14
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,474
has again descended on the town."

15
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,804
"Shadow of Death"?
I don't like it.

16
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:42,932
That's what they're saying.
People are scared out there.

17
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:47,446
"For decades, Fairwater
has been linked with death...

18
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:51,608
following the 1964
Bradley-Bartlett murder spree.

19
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:55,288
Thirty years later,
as the death toll steadily rises...

20
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,502
it appears the Grim Reaper
has once again returned...

21
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:01,334
to the quiet streets of Fairwater."

22
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,500
Oh, no. Steve, no.

23
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,014
I asked for a new angle.
Give me something fresh.

24
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:13,473
I want to see the human face of
this tragedy. Talk to the families.

25
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,524
How has this affected
the local community?

26
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:18,312
Yes, Miss Rees-Jones.

27
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:19,691
And, Steve...

28
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,699
no more references
to death as a person.

29
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:06,915
Friend of the family?
Really such a shame.

30
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:17,588
Go on. Get out. Go on.

31
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,094
Get out!

32
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,158
Damn.

33
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:28,841
Oh, my God!

34
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:31,847
Oh, my God!

35
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:36,019
I don't believe this.
This is not happening. My lawn!

36
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:37,692
You ruptured my lawn!

37
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:42,692
Hey, how you doing?

38
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,871
Give me a call.
I'll pay for the damages.

39
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:49,156
You're damn right! I'm suing your ass!

40
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:52,044
Don't get litigious. Send me a bill.

41
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:55,047
"Frank Bannister, Psychic Investigator"?

42
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,546
So why didn't you see
the corner coming?

43
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,218
You stupid moron!
This is goddamn bullshit!

44
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,382
This will cost you big time!

45
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,135
You're paying for a new fence!

46
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:09,687
I want this lawn
completely resurfaced!

47
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:12,180
Budzo!

48
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:14,727
My Budzo! My Budzo!

49
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,572
I got your license plate number!
You bastard!

50
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,263
This is private property.

51
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,773
Mrs. Bradley? I'm Dr. Lynskey.
I work at the medical center.

52
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,275
You do not.
I know who works there.

53
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,607
I started 3 months ago.

54
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,907
Dr. Kamins is my physician.

55
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:59,947
He's attending a funeral.
I'm seeing his patients today.

56
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:06,421
She was cutting vegetables.
The knife slipped.

57
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:10,465
She just needs a few stitches.
I'll drive you to the clinic.

58
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,631
That's impossible.

59
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,095
It's a deep cut.

60
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:16,472
Leave us antibiotics.

61
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:17,807
Mother, please.

62
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:20,477
Patricia never leaves the house.

63
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,311
But it hurts.

64
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:25,313
To your room this instant!

65
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,320
Wait. Just a minute.

66
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,159
Who did that to you?

67
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:42,341
I think you'd better go now,
Dr. Lynskey.

68
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:50,516
You don't know
who my daughter is, do you?

69
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,012
Patricia's not to be trusted.

70
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:54,349
I beg your pardon?

71
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:57,692
I can have her locked up
anytime I want.

72
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:05,864
They said she was
an accessory after the fact.

73
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,197
I know the truth.

74
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:12,705
It was cold-blooded murder.

75
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:34,358
In the space of 27
blood-soaked minutes...

76
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,566
12 innocent people were shot by
hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett.

77
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,407
Patients, medical staff, visitors...

78
00:09:42,705 --> 00:09:47,533
no one was spared in this rampage
through Fairwater Sanatorium.

79
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:49,745
Not even the hospital chapel...

80
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:54,211
provided sanctuary, as those in prayer
were shot on their knees.

81
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,716
We're reporters.
We have to get the news!

82
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,548
A seemingly senseless crime...

83
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:03,267
Bartlett's motive
remains a mystery to this day.

84
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:04,933
Johnny Bartlett.

85
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,932
He's got a demonic look
on his face.

86
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,106
Any comments, Johnny?

87
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:14,610
Got me a score of 12, sir.
That's one more than Starkweather.

88
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:18,451
Six years earlier,
Charles Starkweather had murdered...

89
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:21,417
eleven people
in a Nebraska killing spree.

90
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:24,462
Guess that makes me
public enemy number one!

91
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:27,038
Fifteen-year-old
Patricia Anne Bradley...

92
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,582
daughter of
the hospital administrator...

93
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:32,471
was also implicated in the killings.

94
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:35,427
She was madly in love
with the psychopath Bartlett.

95
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:36,806
That's her!

96
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,972
I was in her house this afternoon.

97
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,490
Terrific. We're in town 3 months and
you've befriended the Manson family.

98
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:55,449
2200 volts of electricity...

99
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:59,332
ended the life of Johnny Bartlett,
the unrepentant killer.

100
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,955
As they threw the switch,
he screamed:

101
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:05,342
"I got me a score of twelve.
Beat that."

102
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:12,350
In what some considered
a miscarriage of justice...

103
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:15,481
Patricia Bradley was sentenced
to life imprisonment...

104
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,523
although it was never proven
she participated in the killings.

105
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,863
Five years ago,
Patricia Bradley was granted...

106
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:25,483
a conditional release
by the governor.

107
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:30,199
Today she lives a reclusive life
back in the family home...

108
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:33,533
Should have fried her
along with Bartlett.

109
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:38,211
She was fifteen years old.
She fell in love with the wrong guy.

110
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:39,880
Could happen to anyone.

111
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:43,512
Sweetie, don't go back there.
Place gives me the creeps.

112
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:45,673
I don't think...

113
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:50,894
Come on, honey.

114
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:58,072
I think tiger's
getting a little lonely.

115
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,042
What the hell is this doing here?

116
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,054
I thought I tore this up.

117
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:20,598
- Did he come back here?
- Who?

118
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:23,052
The moron who tore up my fence!

119
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:33,945
Help!

120
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:35,778
- Help!
- He's alive.

121
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,448
Ray, get me off!

122
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:01,973
You... sick... thing!

123
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,320
Lucy, I don't want
that con man in my house!

124
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,825
There has to be some kind
of rational explanation for this.

125
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,001
Ray! We have got a poltergeist!

126
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:21,339
It's nothing the police can't handle.

127
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:28,842
Bannister.

128
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:33,009
Dr. Lynskey, I'm on my way.

129
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:46,817
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.

130
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:49,528
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

131
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,493
The activity is located where?

132
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:56,878
I don't know. It went quiet
about 5 minutes ago.

133
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:59,212
Went quiet?

134
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:03,006
The dining room table spun
in a counterclockwise direction?

135
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:05,382
I don't think that happened.

136
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:10,054
The toilet seat lid
banged up and down?

137
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:15,062
- Did the bed levitate?
- Yeah. With me on it.

138
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:19,737
Spontaneous recurrent psychokinesis.
Oh, boy.

139
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,574
This could be the worst case
I've ever seen. It's bad.

140
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:31,248
Well, I can do a clearance,
but it's not going to be cheap.

141
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,382
I do offer a six-month guarantee.

142
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:34,588
How much?

143
00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:37,421
249.95.

144
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:42,094
And there is a 30% surcharge for making
a house call after midnight.

145
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:44,096
And there's vehicle, gas.

146
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:48,941
I'd say the whole thing will set you
back about $450.

147
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:54,856
We could forget about the fence,
call it even.

148
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,455
Stand back, ma'am. I don't want you
to have to sign a waiver.

149
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:08,425
Plus, a hundred bucks
for materials.

150
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,923
Just do it, for Christ's sake.

151
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,798
Here we go.

152
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,649
Why us? Why are they in our house?

153
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:25,271
Emanations are normally confined
to the cemetery...

154
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,601
although they do escape.

155
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:27,984
Usually young ones.

156
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,275
Oh, for God's sake, come on.

157
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,325
Come on.

158
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:41,500
It's holy water.

159
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:57,190
This is bullshit.
This is total bullshit.

160
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:00,520
Come on, come on, come on.

161
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:02,186
Yes!

162
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,034
Okay, these belong to you.

163
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,862
Six ectoplasmic emanations.

164
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,701
Don't worry. They can't escape.

165
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:15,203
Some people like a souvenir.

166
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:20,542
I really don't think we want
to keep those. Thank you. Do we, hon?

167
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,714
I could give a rat's ass.

168
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:25,049
Okay, we'll just...

169
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,359
They can't feel a thing.
At least that's what the book says.

170
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:36,398
You never know for sure.

171
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:40,906
All right. Thank you, Bannister.
You can go.

172
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:46,207
What are you staring at?

173
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,249
What's with the number?

174
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:52,418
What number?

175
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:57,717
If you're trying to freak me out,
it's not working.

176
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,433
He's just trying to get
more money out of us.

177
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:05,103
Get your shit and get
the hell out of my house.

178
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,436
Come on.

179
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,271
Move!

180
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,606
Thank you so much.

181
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,778
There you go.

182
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,534
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

183
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:25,462
Why must you always
alienate everybody?

184
00:17:51,494 --> 00:17:53,155
I think I'm going to throw up.

185
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:55,828
Damn.

186
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:19,521
I hate that trunk!

187
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,485
I don't want ectoplasmic muck
all over my car seats.

188
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:26,701
The ectoplasm is the only thing
sticky enough...

189
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,028
to hold the damn car together.

190
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:33,994
I'm sorry about your shit Volvo,
but we won't ride in the trunk no more.

191
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,380
We could like to cruise
with some style, man.

192
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,543
You two left me high and dry.

193
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:43,842
I get to the house, nothing's
happening. I couldn't believe it.

194
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,219
Hey, Stuart... in or out.

195
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:52,689
Not even a banging toilet lid.
I looked like a asshole.

196
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:56,235
We strained our backs
lifting that heavy-ass bed.

197
00:18:56,572 --> 00:19:00,404
Oh, yeah. What idiot put the number
on the guy's forehead?

198
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,241
It wasn't funny.

199
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:08,250
Start pulling your weight,
or it's back to the cemetery.

200
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:12,757
Pull this, Frank. I'm about
to go like Jesse on your ass.

201
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,751
I'm going to find some other
black ghosts and organize a march.

202
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:21,219
The African-American
Apparition Coalition. The AAAC.

203
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:23,095
I'll tell you something.

204
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:27,560
Nothing's worse than some pissed-off
brothers that's already dead!

205
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:42,950
Therefore, a happy ghost
is a productive ghost.

206
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:47,079
To that end, I've drawn up
a list of suggestions.

207
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:52,129
Bear in mind, we have given you
five years of loyal service.

208
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:57,143
Flies. That's what
you've given me, flies.

209
00:19:57,436 --> 00:20:00,603
Why do flies stick to you guys
like shit to a blanket?

210
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,808
Very funny. You're a funny guy.

211
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:06,276
You only think about yourself.
I could complain, too.

212
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:10,783
I need some new clothes. I still look
like Linc from "The Mod Squad".

213
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:13,152
You died in the '70s. Bummer.

214
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:24,008
Now, Frank,
we got to talk about cigars.

215
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,300
You promised to buy me a box.

216
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,846
I hate to tell you,
but you're dead. You can't smoke.

217
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,680
Light one and blow the smoke
in my face.

218
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,481
If I light a cigar,
I'll blow my lunch in your face.

219
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,851
Everybody, get down!
Damn it, Judge!

220
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:48,528
Put the shooters away!

221
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,835
That was a head shot!
He could have killed me!

222
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:03,548
If I wanted to get shot at every day,
I'd move to Los Angeles!

223
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:15,276
When a man's jawbone drops off...

224
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:18,946
it's time to reassess the situation.

225
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,446
I got myself...

226
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:28,285
a nice little grave
up there at the cemetery.

227
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:32,965
It could soon be time
to lay my bones.

228
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:37,049
You're my go-to guy.
Without you, I'm out of business.

229
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:38,967
Frightening...

230
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:42,808
that's a young man's game, Frank.

231
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:46,064
I ain't got no more hauntings
left in me.

232
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:48,226
What? You're in...

233
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,230
great shape.

234
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,480
My joints are getting powdery.

235
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:57,486
The dog is running away with my face.
Hell, I'm falling apart.

236
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,822
You have been for years.

237
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:06,838
Don't say nothing to the boys, but...

238
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:11,174
my ectoplasm is all dried up.

239
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:14,339
I'm sorry to hear that, Judge.

240
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:17,929
Give it up, Frank.

241
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,512
Death ain't no way
to make a living.

242
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,267
I have to finish this house.

243
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:26,025
You'll never finish this house!
You'll never finish nothing!

244
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,022
You're fooling yourself, Frank!

245
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:37,540
Too many skeletons in the closet.

246
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:42,047
Okay, this is it.
We got to be hard.

247
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:46,961
We go in like Charles Bronson.
We don't stop till the screaming starts.

248
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:48,550
I'm with you.

249
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,553
Let's go.

250
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:56,053
Yeah. Let's kick some ass.

251
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:58,391
Here we go.
One, two, three.

252
00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:02,567
Good morning,
my darlings. Hello.

253
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,398
The mail is on the table,
Mrs. Waterhouse.

254
00:23:06,077 --> 00:23:09,742
Sylvia, Mother is coming for lunch.
Pick up. Quick.

255
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:14,080
Big kiss.

256
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:17,754
Quit jumping around like a baby.
This is serious.

257
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:22,758
We're going to scare the living
daylights out of your parents.

258
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:25,922
- Will you help us out?
- Are you with us?

259
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:30,436
See? He gets it.
The kids always get it.

260
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:31,769
Let's go.

261
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,279
Mrs. Waterhouse.

262
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,284
Mrs. Waterhouse!

263
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,543
Damn. Here, man.
This one did le poo-poo.

264
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,287
- Get it away from me.
- Oh, man, it smells.

265
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:53,711
Mrs. Waterhouse!

266
00:23:57,638 --> 00:23:59,216
My babies!

267
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:09,644
Frank Bannister.

268
00:24:11,821 --> 00:24:14,147
I'm on my way.

269
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:24,496
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.

270
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:29,666
Frank Bannister. I believe you called.
Not a minute too soon.

271
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,421
- Frank, she...
- Shut up.

272
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,838
Frank, it's no use.

273
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,261
This is bad.

274
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:39,017
Recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis.

275
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:42,522
This could be the worst case
I have ever...

276
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,106
seen.

277
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:53,449
I apologize for calling you,
Mr. Bannister. Please leave.

278
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,202
What are you doing to me?

279
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,462
Preying on the bereaved
is as low as you can go.

280
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:04,466
You're a parasite.
People should be warned.

281
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,719
I've a right to offer
my services to the public.

282
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:11,555
In case you haven't noticed,
we are having a major health crisis.

283
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:15,559
The last thing the people here need
is a two-bit charlatan...

284
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,982
passing on bogus messages
from the other side.

285
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:21,394
Now, if you will excuse me.

286
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:26,734
I'm just trying to make a living.

287
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:31,740
Living? Not a word you'd know
a lot about, is it, Mr. Bannister?

288
00:25:35,254 --> 00:25:36,914
Hey, easy.

289
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:26,559
You all right, buddy?

290
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:28,059
That was quite a fall.

291
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:29,397
Bannister!

292
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,572
You have to help.
They're going to bury me.

293
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:36,739
You have to help.
What is happening to me?

294
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,572
You appear to be dead, Ray.

295
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,748
That's impossible.
I'm in the prime of my life.

296
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,159
I work out.
My wife's a doctor!

297
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,911
- Why didn't you take the corridor?
- What corridor?

298
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:49,499
The passageway to the other side.

299
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:54,090
Because I don't belong there!
Jesus Christ, I'm only 29!

300
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:02,521
Just relax, all right?
Tell me what happened.

301
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:04,186
I was on the rowing machine.

302
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:08,109
Suddenly, I felt this vice-like grip
squeezing my heart...

303
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:12,363
and I couldn't breathe, Frank,
I just couldn't breathe.

304
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:16,538
I have the shakes.
I need some vitamin B.

305
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,034
You can't take vitamins anymore.

306
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:23,708
You don't eat, drink or go to
the bathroom. All that's over with.

307
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:30,631
In a year, you'll get another chance
for the other side, to be a pure spirit.

308
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:33,300
In the meantime,
you're an earthbound emanation...

309
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:38,390
a rotting cloud of bioplasmic
particles, dripping ectoplasm.

310
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:47,069
Relax, Ray.

311
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:52,744
All right, Bannister.

312
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:56,753
Can you give me a ride
so I don't miss my funeral?

313
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,596
Don't worry.
They won't hurt you.

314
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:18,355
What in the hell is going on out here?
Get back in your graves!

315
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,944
Son of a...

316
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,285
Holy Jesus.
Frank Bannister!

317
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:25,448
Go ahead. I'll handle this.

318
00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:33,122
What are you doing in my graveyard?
You have been told to stay away!

319
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:35,211
Sound off like you have a pair!

320
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:36,667
It's a public place, Hiles.

321
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,048
I do not like you!

322
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:43,134
Do not bring your spooks in here
without permission. Disappear, scumbag!

323
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,241
I am not one of your shitty
little emanations!

324
00:28:57,328 --> 00:29:00,744
You cannot push spirits around!
You are scum!

325
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:06,328
Using spooks to put the frighteners on
people! That makes me physically ill!

326
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,832
We have a lot of lowlifes around here!

327
00:29:10,176 --> 00:29:13,676
I will provide an armed response
at any sign of trouble!

328
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:16,422
They must be contained!

329
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,853
Catch you later, Hiles.

330
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,863
My tour of duty
runs another 85 years!

331
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:31,698
There's a piece of dirt here
with your name on it.

332
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,871
I'm waiting for you,
you little maggot!

333
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,207
There were times
when people accused Ray...

334
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,288
of being less than generous,
but I am sure that deep down...

335
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:47,879
the man possessed a heart of gold
and a generous spirit.

336
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:54,387
It's true. He wouldn't lie,
not at a time like this.

337
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:00,394
Because God has chosen...

338
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:06,491
to call Ray from this life to Himself,
we commit his body to the ground.

339
00:30:06,577 --> 00:30:09,329
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

340
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,075
Jesus, what a waste.

341
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,409
It's a goddamn tragedy!

342
00:30:18,591 --> 00:30:19,587
Good-bye, Ray.

343
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:29,260
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry.

344
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:31,848
Oh, shit!

345
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:56,129
Hey, Frank!

346
00:30:58,805 --> 00:31:00,134
I know you can hear me!

347
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:02,467
Get me out of this hole!

348
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:04,972
Frank! Get me out!

349
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:06,642
Hiya, Frank.

350
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:09,145
Hi, Walt.

351
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,486
I'm surprised to see you.
Here on business?

352
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:13,901
Not exactly.

353
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:16,233
They're going to bury me alive!

354
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:20,990
I hear you and Lynskey had a little
run-in the night before he died.

355
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:24,158
Apart from his wife...

356
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:27,670
you were the last person
to see him alive.

357
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:29,667
You're the one here on business.

358
00:31:32,512 --> 00:31:36,012
No. The FBI is very concerned
about these deaths.

359
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,928
They look like heart attacks...

360
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:41,686
but when they slice these people open,
their arteries are...

361
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:43,520
clean as a whistle.

362
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,278
But there's been tremendous pressure
on the heart...

363
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,938
like the life's been
crushed out of it.

364
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,529
You got any theories?

365
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,278
Bannister!

366
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:00,707
You mind if I pay my last respects
before they fill him in?

367
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,874
Yeah. I'm sorry.

368
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,214
Bannister!

369
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:10,718
Please.

370
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:28,404
Mr. Bannister.

371
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,001
Did you want to see me?

372
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,922
My God, Frank, she can see me!

373
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:43,588
I thought perhaps you
might have a message from Ray.

374
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:47,431
Tell her. Tell her I'm here, Frank.
Tell her.

375
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:51,517
Everyone says you're a fraud,
but I've seen what you can do.

376
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:54,937
Frank!

377
00:32:58,614 --> 00:33:02,280
You must think I'm very stupid.
Excuse me.

378
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:06,034
Lucy.

379
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,785
Ray says he loves you very much.

380
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:22,466
Here is your table.

381
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:25,518
- Hi.
- Hi.

382
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:31,477
Is Ray with us?

383
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:36,736
Tell her she looks great.

384
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:41,827
He, uh, he says you look great.

385
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,169
Tell her they're from me.

386
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:51,085
Those are from Ray.

387
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:53,591
It's our anniversary.

388
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:56,090
He says it's your anniversary.

389
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:59,853
Is... Is Ray beside me?

390
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:07,358
Greetings.

391
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:11,232
How are you this evening?
May I offer you some wine?

392
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:14,953
Lucy, do you want some?
What... red, white?

393
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:17,449
Red. We always have red.

394
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,328
White.

395
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:20,450
I've never liked red.

396
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:22,578
Lucy!

397
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,295
So you used to be an architect?

398
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,587
Long time ago.

399
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:33,263
Can it. She doesn't want
to hear your life story.

400
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:36,479
Wow. So, did you
build your own house?

401
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,268
Is it your dream home?

402
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:40,318
You could call it that.

403
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,612
I'll build you a dream home
once I get on my feet.

404
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:48,159
Why is it you can see Ray
and I can't?

405
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,832
I was in an accident.
It was a car accident.

406
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:56,163
About five years ago.

407
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:01,170
They say that...

408
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:05,510
sometimes when you have
a traumatic experience...

409
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:08,685
it can alter your perception.

410
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:12,023
So after that,
you could just see spirits?

411
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:14,682
I mean, what happened?

412
00:35:16,528 --> 00:35:20,028
How about you talk to Ray?
That's why I'm here.

413
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:23,036
Finally, I'm in the conversation.
Terrific.

414
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:27,374
I do have an important question
I have to ask Ray.

415
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,204
He can hear you.

416
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:34,712
Ray...

417
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:38,841
I really need to know
where you invested my money.

418
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,891
The $16,000 that I had saved.

419
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,350
The attorneys can't find it.

420
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,232
Oh, shit! I blew it
on a bad investment.

421
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:52,059
Don't tell her that.
Let me think.

422
00:35:52,404 --> 00:35:54,065
It's gone.
Lucy, it's gone.

423
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:55,866
Blown on a bad investment.

424
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:57,404
You asshole!

425
00:35:57,744 --> 00:36:02,241
Tell her I'll look out for her.
I'll move back into the house.

426
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,369
That's not a good idea.

427
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:06,579
This doesn't concern you.

428
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,209
What's Ray saying?

429
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,251
He left. Ray left.

430
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:14,217
He said he's sorry, but you
should get on with your life.

431
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:16,720
Bannister, I'm going to kill you!

432
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,763
I can't believe it. That's just like
Ray to just take the money and run.

433
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:30,106
Ray and I haven't been honest with each
other in a long time, Mr. Bannister.

434
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:36,288
It wasn't what you would call
a good marriage.

435
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,415
You bitch!

436
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:47,426
Lt'll be okay.

437
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:49,297
Hands off my wife!

438
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,468
Goddamn it!

439
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,972
Sorry.

440
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:59,476
I can move shit, Bannister.
You better watch your back.

441
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,480
I better clean this up.

442
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,108
Be right back.

443
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:26,843
Good food, huh?

444
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,844
Yeah... it's great.

445
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,789
Mom!

446
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,995
Looks like another heart attack.
Can't confirm it till the autopsy.

447
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:34,330
Damn.

448
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:39,293
A waiter saw a guy exit the john
right before the body was found.

449
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:41,133
And who was that?

450
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:45,638
Frank Bannister, pale and shaking.
The waiter thought he was sick.

451
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,177
Damn.

452
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:49,847
Hi, Lucy.

453
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,859
Dr. Lynskey works for me.
We're colleagues.

454
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,186
She's a material witness.

455
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:09,039
Bannister was last seen
in the restaurant parking lot.

456
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:11,037
He took off at high speed.

457
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:17,005
Bring him in.

458
00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:24,508
Look at that!

459
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,264
So your dead husband
was having dinner with you?

460
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:05,771
What did he order?

461
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:14,278
Oh, God. Excuse me.

462
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:32,640
Timmy, front desk, please.

463
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:35,092
Thank you.

464
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:39,976
Lucy, this is Special Agent
Milton Dammers of the FBI.

465
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:51,661
I came by train. I planned to fly,
but I didn't feel good about the plane.

466
00:41:51,957 --> 00:41:53,499
At what time...

467
00:41:54,168 --> 00:41:57,288
precisely, did Bannister
leave for the bathroom?

468
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:00,420
You.

469
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:03,168
I'm not sure...

470
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:04,799
precisely.

471
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:07,839
Did he use
excessive amounts of salt?

472
00:42:08,685 --> 00:42:09,800
Answer the question.

473
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:12,643
For Christ's sake,
it's really late!

474
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:14,020
I don't remember!

475
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:22,196
What is this?

476
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:25,371
Excuse me, Lucy.
I'll be right back.

477
00:42:29,752 --> 00:42:30,748
Milton...

478
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:35,377
Sorry, Sheriff.

479
00:42:36,718 --> 00:42:38,711
I have a problem
with women yelling.

480
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:41,380
Can I get you anything?

481
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:43,552
Sheriff Perry!

482
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:46,517
You are violating
my territorial bubble.

483
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,069
Lucy, you're still grieving.

484
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:04,163
It would be easy for a man
like Frank to take advantage.

485
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:07,579
You have such closed minds.

486
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:08,835
I object!

487
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:14,597
Special Agent Dammers has over...

488
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:17,849
20 years' experience
in the area of...

489
00:43:18,184 --> 00:43:20,261
paranormal psychology.

490
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:22,930
Much of that was spent undercover...

491
00:43:23,274 --> 00:43:24,602
with various...

492
00:43:25,443 --> 00:43:27,436
cults and sects.

493
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:30,658
I get all the fruity cases,
Mrs. Lynskey.

494
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:34,322
For God's sake, Milton,
come in and sit down.

495
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,323
I'm more comfortable standing.

496
00:43:36,623 --> 00:43:38,616
What has this to do with Frank?

497
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:42,001
Mrs. Lynskey, you know
nothing about Frank Bannister.

498
00:43:42,296 --> 00:43:44,420
You claim
he's a bona fide psychic...

499
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,301
yet all I have heard
is ill-informed, meandering waffle.

500
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,849
On the third day of July 1990...

501
00:43:52,183 --> 00:43:55,517
Frank Bannister,
then a successful architect...

502
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:58,856
was overseeing construction
of his new home.

503
00:44:00,026 --> 00:44:01,189
The contractor...

504
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:03,022
Jacob Platz...

505
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:07,735
would later confirm that Bannister
was consuming alcohol that morning.

506
00:44:07,827 --> 00:44:10,152
12:23 P.M.

507
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:14,832
Platz sees Bannister
arguing with his wife, Debra.

508
00:44:14,877 --> 00:44:18,710
It appears he had
promised Debra a garden...

509
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,048
and then, without consulting her,
laid a 4-inch thick concrete slab...

510
00:44:24,388 --> 00:44:27,224
creating a basketball court
for himself.

511
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,387
12:31 P.M.

512
00:44:31,063 --> 00:44:34,563
Platz watches the couple drive away.

513
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:40,402
Bannister kept a tool box
in the back of his car.

514
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:42,734
In it was a utility knife...

515
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:44,737
with a retractable blade.

516
00:44:45,246 --> 00:44:48,414
Bannister purchased seven...

517
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:51,753
new blades that morning...

518
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:55,756
at Jesson's Hardware Store
and Building Supply...

519
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:59,427
on Third and Garrett...
Third and Garrett.

520
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,424
Third of July.

521
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,760
Seven blades. Three.

522
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:05,098
Milton...

523
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:08,604
you're mumbling; we can't
understand a word you're saying.

524
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,892
12:33 P.M.

525
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:14,529
Their '84 Volvo heads into the hills.

526
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:19,113
It is the last time anyone
will see the couple together.

527
00:45:19,454 --> 00:45:20,948
By Bannister's admission...

528
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:24,119
the argument continues,
reaching a point...

529
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:25,793
when Debra demands...

530
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:27,118
to be let out.

531
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:31,296
At that moment, probably 12:36,
12:37 P.M., the car...

532
00:45:31,593 --> 00:45:33,633
leaves the road on a curve...

533
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:39,300
presumably because Bannister
was driving too fast.

534
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:40,974
She was killed?

535
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:46,939
Her body was found
15 yards from the car.

536
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:49,149
Bannister...

537
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:52,989
was picked up 2 hours later,
wandering in the woods.

538
00:45:53,327 --> 00:45:56,661
He claimed to have no recollection
of the events...

539
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:58,950
that occurred after the accident.

540
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:02,170
But here's the odd thing,
Mrs. Lynskey.

541
00:46:02,505 --> 00:46:04,165
His utility knife...

542
00:46:05,175 --> 00:46:06,835
was missing.

543
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:11,343
And to this day,
it has not been found.

544
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:15,852
But do you know
what was really bizarre?

545
00:46:17,523 --> 00:46:21,023
Debra's corpse
had the number 13...

546
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,354
carved into its forehead.

547
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,526
Unlucky for some.

548
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,494
You're insane. You're talking
about a mythical figure.

549
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:40,881
A pseudo-religious icon
from the 12th century.

550
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:46,213
Save your pea-brained prattle
for the classroom, boy.

551
00:46:46,724 --> 00:46:49,726
That was the Soul Collector.

552
00:46:50,562 --> 00:46:55,059
He's been taking people out
since time began.

553
00:46:55,902 --> 00:46:59,900
He's going about some dark business
here in Fairwater...

554
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,566
and we ain't nothing
but worm bait!

555
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:06,239
When your number's up...

556
00:47:07,082 --> 00:47:08,196
that's it!

557
00:47:13,422 --> 00:47:15,415
There's another one gone.

558
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,947
He's gone.

559
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:15,159
There's no money for you here,
Mr. Bannister.

560
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:17,827
You're next.

561
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:20,126
Are you threatening me?

562
00:48:20,627 --> 00:48:22,620
That's not what I'm saying.

563
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:24,499
He's threatening to kill me.

564
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:27,290
- Will you relax?
- He is threatening to kill me!

565
00:48:27,511 --> 00:48:28,507
Bannister!

566
00:48:28,845 --> 00:48:30,174
Oh, great.

567
00:48:30,472 --> 00:48:31,504
Hey, fellas.

568
00:48:33,184 --> 00:48:34,513
Excuse me, excuse me.

569
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:35,974
Put the gun away.

570
00:48:36,188 --> 00:48:38,015
- Freeze!
- Just take it easy.

571
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:45,699
Okay, Bannister,
you're under arrest.

572
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:53,365
Just stay there, Bannister.

573
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,044
Yes.

574
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:08,054
Great.

575
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:09,887
I did it.

576
00:49:11,354 --> 00:49:12,897
Uh-uh-uh, Bannister. Stop.

577
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:17,562
Looks like I ain't shooting
with blanks no more!

578
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:23,909
Mighty fine woman.
Good teeth.

579
00:49:26,748 --> 00:49:27,863
Judge.

580
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:29,375
Down!

581
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:33,083
They don't call me
the hanging judge for nothing.

582
00:49:39,096 --> 00:49:40,756
Stay right there.

583
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:46,431
Heads up!

584
00:49:46,771 --> 00:49:47,767
Good catch.

585
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,295
Freeze!

586
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:18,091
Good shooting, Tex.

587
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:23,976
And she was
so young and beautiful!

588
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,834
I like it when they
lie still like that.

589
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:48,958
This is heavy.

590
00:50:53,643 --> 00:50:57,688
Hey, guys!
My juices are flowing again!

591
00:51:03,154 --> 00:51:04,150
Judge!

592
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,696
Judge!

593
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,323
Bannister!

594
00:51:09,537 --> 00:51:11,530
Frank, get out of here, now!

595
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,368
Bastard!

596
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:17,205
Got to go.

597
00:51:18,172 --> 00:51:19,168
Bannister!

598
00:51:19,382 --> 00:51:20,544
Stop!

599
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:48,911
Damn! Come on!

600
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:15,400
Just get down!

601
00:52:15,615 --> 00:52:17,110
Get down and stay down.

602
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,073
Magda!

603
00:53:00,794 --> 00:53:02,122
Listen to me.

604
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,356
No!

605
00:53:35,043 --> 00:53:36,158
Where'd he go?

606
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:45,217
You killed me, you bastard!
You're sick!

607
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,174
Is this how you get your kicks?

608
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,717
Did it feel good killing me?

609
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:53,395
Did it feel good
killing your wife?

610
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:56,899
You're a murderer!

611
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:12,372
He won't get far.
We have the state line covered.

612
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:14,083
Sheriff Perry...

613
00:54:14,423 --> 00:54:18,089
I seriously doubt we will
see Bannister any time soon.

614
00:54:18,386 --> 00:54:21,720
He is resourceful beyond anything
you can comprehend.

615
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:27,932
Hello, Frank.

616
00:54:28,023 --> 00:54:29,018
Hey, Walt.

617
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:32,100
I've come to report that...

618
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:34,272
Magda Rees-Jones's...

619
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:38,115
body is lying near my car...

620
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:40,780
off Holloway Road.

621
00:54:41,747 --> 00:54:44,583
Did you have anything
to do with her death?

622
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:51,757
Frank, are you okay?

623
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:53,130
What happened?

624
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:55,918
What are you doing?

625
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:57,469
You're arresting him?

626
00:54:57,766 --> 00:54:58,798
Please leave.

627
00:54:59,143 --> 00:55:01,302
Frank, you need a lawyer.

628
00:55:01,604 --> 00:55:02,980
Go home, Lucy.

629
00:55:03,314 --> 00:55:06,186
But you haven't done anything.
He hasn't done anything!

630
00:55:06,276 --> 00:55:07,605
How do you know?

631
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:09,482
Do you know me?

632
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:11,983
Am I a nice guy?
Because...

633
00:55:13,493 --> 00:55:16,661
that cozy scene in the restaurant
was bullshit.

634
00:55:16,956 --> 00:55:17,952
Because...

635
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,744
I was doing my job.

636
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:23,831
I don't give a damn
about you or anyone.

637
00:55:24,173 --> 00:55:26,082
What are you saying?

638
00:55:26,175 --> 00:55:27,504
Go home.

639
00:55:34,852 --> 00:55:36,512
Are you okay to drive?

640
00:55:40,025 --> 00:55:44,853
There has been a destructive force
unleashed on this town...

641
00:55:45,198 --> 00:55:47,523
such as I have never seen.

642
00:55:49,202 --> 00:55:50,863
We have a body count...

643
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,704
of 28.

644
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:01,670
You're a very dangerous man.

645
00:56:01,884 --> 00:56:05,669
You're not seriously suggesting
that Frank is responsible for...

646
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:10,184
You're way out of your depth here,
Sheriff. Please leave.

647
00:56:11,062 --> 00:56:13,055
Frank Bannister is my prisoner.

648
00:56:13,857 --> 00:56:18,520
By the power invested in me by
the President of the United States...

649
00:56:18,737 --> 00:56:20,197
I am telling you...

650
00:56:20,406 --> 00:56:23,573
to get the hell out of this room.

651
00:56:57,283 --> 00:56:59,739
Have you ever heard
of Nina Kulagina?

652
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:05,241
March 10, 1970, Nina Kulagina,
with the power of her mind...

653
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,785
stopped the beat of a frog's heart.

654
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,464
The record of this experiment
is currently held...

655
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:16,796
in the files of Professor Gennady
Sergeyev of Saint Petersburg.

656
00:57:17,307 --> 00:57:20,474
As Sergeyev
interpreted the cardiogram...

657
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:24,430
the heart experienced
a flare-up of electrical activity.

658
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,642
The heart imploded...

659
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,818
all because Nina Kulagina
wanted the animal dead.

660
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,114
I don't kill people.

661
00:57:40,835 --> 00:57:42,828
Part of you believes that.

662
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,339
There's another part of you, Frank...

663
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,670
that's out of control.

664
00:57:50,513 --> 00:57:52,839
Your destructive impulse.

665
00:57:55,686 --> 00:57:57,845
I've seen a figure in a cape.

666
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,984
I've seen him reach into people's
chests and squeeze their hearts.

667
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:05,860
Who was it?

668
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:12,196
Who was it?

669
00:58:15,042 --> 00:58:16,371
Death.

670
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,372
I can communicate
with the other side.

671
00:58:22,718 --> 00:58:24,379
I can see spirits.

672
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:27,717
I don't know why.

673
00:58:28,225 --> 00:58:29,885
I can't understand it.

674
00:58:30,895 --> 00:58:34,395
You think you're quite unique,
don't you?

675
00:58:34,899 --> 00:58:39,895
But in my business, I deal
with your type every other week.

676
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,065
This death figure...

677
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:46,744
is nothing more
than a homicidal alter ego...

678
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:49,709
that satisfies
your compulsion to kill.

679
00:58:50,752 --> 00:58:53,243
Every time
you want to kill someone...

680
00:58:53,547 --> 00:58:55,540
"death" does it for you.

681
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:58,426
It's your way
of absolving yourself of guilt.

682
00:58:58,511 --> 00:59:00,053
No!

683
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:04,262
When did you first start
seeing spirits? After Debra's death?

684
00:59:05,269 --> 00:59:08,104
You killed your wife.

685
00:59:08,564 --> 00:59:09,727
No!

686
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:12,400
I have studied...

687
00:59:12,611 --> 00:59:15,945
the coroner's reports
of every death here since 1985.

688
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:19,782
Twenty-eight cases
involved crushed hearts...

689
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,790
arteries choked until they burst.

690
00:59:23,082 --> 00:59:26,083
That started in 1990, with your...

691
00:59:26,794 --> 00:59:29,286
beautiful wife, Debra.

692
00:59:30,465 --> 00:59:32,126
She was the first.

693
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:35,798
Ray Lynskey.

694
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,809
You argue with him,
3 hours later he's dead.

695
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,144
We know you didn't like
Magda Rees-Jones.

696
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:45,817
But what about the guy in the toilet?

697
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:48,775
What did he do to you, Frank?

698
00:59:50,322 --> 00:59:52,481
Piss on your Hush Puppies?

699
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:56,822
Why are you shaking?

700
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:01,160
Oh, my.

701
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:05,671
My, my. You're doing it right now,
aren't you?

702
01:00:07,676 --> 01:00:10,678
You're trying to kill me, right now.

703
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:13,508
Well, forget it, Bannister.

704
01:00:14,852 --> 01:00:17,177
I'm wearing a lead breastplate!

705
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:19,975
We have 28...

706
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:22,351
unexplained deaths here.

707
01:00:22,694 --> 01:00:25,696
You know what I think?
I think you...

708
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:29,033
are involved in each
and every one of them!

709
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:13,208
Well, so much for the dream home.

710
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:16,090
What are we doing here, Lucy?

711
01:01:17,593 --> 01:01:20,263
Look at this place.
It's a dump!

712
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,757
God, this guy is a loser.

713
01:01:47,795 --> 01:01:50,750
Perfectly good basketball court
gone to pot.

714
01:01:51,633 --> 01:01:53,294
Yeah, Bannister.

715
01:01:54,095 --> 01:01:55,637
Mr. Bannister, help me!

716
01:01:56,139 --> 01:02:00,137
My daughter, Patricia,
is communing with the Evil One.

717
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:03,562
He's in this house
at her instigation.

718
01:02:03,606 --> 01:02:06,975
Help me drive them out!

719
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:34,681
Lucy, why do you keep
shutting me out?

720
01:02:39,148 --> 01:02:40,144
Lucy!

721
01:02:44,529 --> 01:02:45,692
Patricia?

722
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:56,372
Dr. Lynskey.

723
01:02:57,211 --> 01:02:59,038
Patricia, are you all right?

724
01:03:13,731 --> 01:03:15,012
It's your mother.

725
01:03:15,483 --> 01:03:17,143
She's been hurting you.

726
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:26,534
She needs help.
She's delusional.

727
01:03:26,872 --> 01:03:29,161
You can't go on like this.

728
01:03:31,377 --> 01:03:33,370
You don't understand.

729
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,548
No!

730
01:03:46,228 --> 01:03:49,229
My father killed himself
after the murders.

731
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,727
Mother says it was my fault.

732
01:03:54,404 --> 01:03:57,240
So I have to keep his ashes
in my room.

733
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:01,572
Oh, my God.

734
01:04:12,593 --> 01:04:14,253
She says I'm evil.

735
01:04:16,097 --> 01:04:17,924
Just like Johnny.

736
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:28,277
Come with me to Mother's room.

737
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,248
This isn't you.

738
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,420
This isn't who you are now.

739
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,593
It was Johnny.

740
01:04:57,104 --> 01:04:58,432
He went crazy.

741
01:05:00,441 --> 01:05:03,941
I couldn't get away from him.
I thought he'd kill me.

742
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:06,354
You have to get out
of this house.

743
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:08,775
You can start over.

744
01:05:16,293 --> 01:05:18,286
It's Mother. Please hide.

745
01:05:18,629 --> 01:05:19,958
Please.

746
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,798
I'll take her to the kitchen.
You sneak out later.

747
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,474
What are you doing in here?

748
01:05:35,149 --> 01:05:36,727
I thought I heard a noise.

749
01:05:39,321 --> 01:05:41,479
I'll make you some coffee, Mother.

750
01:06:31,549 --> 01:06:32,545
Mother.

751
01:06:33,886 --> 01:06:35,380
The coffee's ready.

752
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:52,399
Lucy, go.

753
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,278
Thank you, Deputy.

754
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:34,120
Just call me when you're done,
Dr. Lynskey.

755
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:39,455
Frank, listen to me.

756
01:07:39,797 --> 01:07:43,962
I found your knife,
hidden in old lady Bradley's closet.

757
01:07:44,303 --> 01:07:45,797
She's crazy, Frank.

758
01:07:47,556 --> 01:07:49,134
You haven't hurt anybody.

759
01:07:51,978 --> 01:07:53,971
You're a good person, Frank.

760
01:07:57,485 --> 01:07:58,814
Don't do this.

761
01:08:00,822 --> 01:08:02,483
Please, don't do this.

762
01:08:07,831 --> 01:08:12,161
Do you think you're the only person
who ever lost somebody?

763
01:08:13,337 --> 01:08:15,414
You walk around like you
have no feelings...

764
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:18,425
but the truth is
you're just scared!

765
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,589
Goddamn hypocrite.

766
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,679
Why are you doing this?
What are you afraid of?

767
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:35,363
I don't want to hurt you, Lucy.

768
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:37,939
Oh, that's crap.
Don't give me that.

769
01:08:42,538 --> 01:08:44,199
Look at me.

770
01:09:19,082 --> 01:09:23,412
I'll be outside. This shit is like
walking in on your parents.

771
01:09:27,091 --> 01:09:30,093
Oh, right. I'll be outside.
I'll just...

772
01:09:35,602 --> 01:09:37,345
What is it, Frank?

773
01:09:37,604 --> 01:09:38,600
Look out!

774
01:09:40,065 --> 01:09:41,097
You son of a bitch!

775
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,449
What's happening?

776
01:09:54,124 --> 01:09:55,951
Grab him! Grab him!

777
01:09:58,295 --> 01:09:59,790
What's happening?

778
01:10:03,969 --> 01:10:06,638
Okay. Listen to me.

779
01:10:06,972 --> 01:10:10,306
Call for the deputy.
And try to sound calm.

780
01:10:11,478 --> 01:10:12,474
Deputy!

781
01:10:12,812 --> 01:10:14,307
I'm ready to leave.

782
01:10:18,486 --> 01:10:19,815
Where did he go?

783
01:10:23,492 --> 01:10:25,152
Stuart, where did he go?

784
01:10:25,411 --> 01:10:26,739
I think we got him.

785
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:39,589
You son of a bitch!

786
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:41,505
Get out, Frank! Go!

787
01:10:47,854 --> 01:10:49,514
It's this way. Go.

788
01:10:53,861 --> 01:10:55,522
Freeze, Bannister.

789
01:10:58,534 --> 01:11:00,194
- Help.
- I got you now.

790
01:11:01,203 --> 01:11:03,031
Help me. He's gone crazy.

791
01:11:03,373 --> 01:11:05,200
Okay. Ah! Stay back!

792
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,039
Now...

793
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:12,962
Frank, come on!

794
01:11:13,218 --> 01:11:15,887
Go, Frank!
Get out of here! Now!

795
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:20,218
Frank, let's go!

796
01:11:25,899 --> 01:11:27,892
This way. Come on.

797
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:46,002
Shit!

798
01:11:46,257 --> 01:11:49,673
What was in that cell?
Something was crushing my heart.

799
01:11:49,928 --> 01:11:53,095
I can't fight him, Luce.
I can't protect you.

800
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:58,928
There's one way
to deal with this thing.

801
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,936
I have to have an out-of-body
experience, and I have to have it now.

802
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,273
Go away, Luce.
Walk the other way.

803
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:12,780
Wait. Wait.

804
01:12:17,294 --> 01:12:19,964
This will slow your heart
and lower your temperature.

805
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:33,970
You'll have 20 minutes. Any longer
and there's a danger of tissue damage.

806
01:12:34,314 --> 01:12:38,478
That's only if I successfully
revive you. There's no guarantee.

807
01:12:41,489 --> 01:12:44,325
Frank, you don't have to do this.

808
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,827
Better close the door.
Hurry up.

809
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:51,491
It won't take long.

810
01:14:09,928 --> 01:14:13,344
I didn't know you had
an interest in cryogenics.

811
01:14:13,932 --> 01:14:15,510
I'm reviving him at 9:00.

812
01:14:15,768 --> 01:14:17,927
Why would we want to do that?

813
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:03,653
Luce!

814
01:15:05,494 --> 01:15:06,490
Lucy?

815
01:15:16,006 --> 01:15:17,833
There we go.

816
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:35,354
Let me go, you bastard!

817
01:15:35,613 --> 01:15:37,440
Let me out now!

818
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,700
You bastard,
let me out of this car now!

819
01:17:04,135 --> 01:17:06,294
I find cemeteries very...

820
01:17:07,806 --> 01:17:09,965
restful places, don't you?

821
01:17:10,309 --> 01:17:13,560
Turn this car around
and take me back.

822
01:17:13,646 --> 01:17:15,805
I intend to, Mrs. Lynskey.

823
01:17:17,484 --> 01:17:20,651
In exactly... eleven hours' time.

824
01:17:20,988 --> 01:17:22,815
Son of a bitch!

825
01:17:25,494 --> 01:17:29,824
Let me out of here!
Come back here, you creep!

826
01:17:48,521 --> 01:17:49,850
My body...

827
01:17:50,356 --> 01:17:52,682
is a road map of pain.

828
01:17:56,197 --> 01:17:57,360
But pain...

829
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,028
has its reward.

830
01:18:04,874 --> 01:18:07,875
The power of the mind...

831
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,041
is absolute.

832
01:18:28,652 --> 01:18:30,645
Frank, is that you?

833
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:36,030
I'm doing this?

834
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:39,240
I'm doing this?

835
01:18:39,498 --> 01:18:42,416
I'm moving the car
with the power of my mind!

836
01:18:43,086 --> 01:18:44,249
Yes!

837
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:45,917
No!

838
01:18:46,423 --> 01:18:47,419
Wait!

839
01:18:52,013 --> 01:18:54,172
Get back in the goddamn ground!

840
01:18:54,433 --> 01:18:57,518
You unorganized grab-asstic gob
of teleplasmic shit!

841
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:14,032
Who the hell are you?

842
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:16,199
Sound off like you've got a pair!

843
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:32,137
Hey, asshole.

844
01:19:54,337 --> 01:19:55,666
He's dead!

845
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:57,584
You're too late!

846
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:03,009
Lucy!

847
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,121
Who are you?

848
01:20:30,213 --> 01:20:31,245
Who...

849
01:20:31,423 --> 01:20:32,586
are...

850
01:20:32,674 --> 01:20:34,169
you?

851
01:20:41,852 --> 01:20:43,512
Johnny Bartlett.

852
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:46,181
I thought guys like you
fried in hell.

853
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:49,686
I got out, Frank.

854
01:20:51,697 --> 01:20:56,194
I've been carrying on the good work.
Got me a score of 40.

855
01:21:08,884 --> 01:21:10,711
Harry Sinclair.

856
01:21:11,053 --> 01:21:14,719
I want to shake the hand
of the man who avenged my death.

857
01:21:15,267 --> 01:21:16,298
You have a number.

858
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:21,814
Bartlett carved it
into my forehead as I lay dying.

859
01:21:23,151 --> 01:21:24,480
I was the last.

860
01:21:24,903 --> 01:21:28,237
He couldn't be more wrong,
could he, Frank?

861
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:37,163
Shit!

862
01:22:23,264 --> 01:22:24,296
Oh, Frank.

863
01:22:27,144 --> 01:22:29,814
Just breathe.
Breathe slowly. Breathe.

864
01:22:30,147 --> 01:22:32,140
You're okay.

865
01:22:32,484 --> 01:22:33,812
Oh, Frank.

866
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:38,982
All right, Lucy, come on.

867
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:43,823
Get me 100 milligrams of lidocaine
and 1 cc of adrenaline.

868
01:22:45,165 --> 01:22:47,158
I didn't get him.

869
01:22:47,668 --> 01:22:49,994
Who? Who didn't you get, Frank?

870
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,007
Johnny Bartlett. He's back.

871
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,138
He's hallucinating.

872
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:01,846
He's killing again.

873
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,848
Patricia.

874
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:08,849
You have to get her
out of the house.

875
01:23:10,112 --> 01:23:11,108
Go.

876
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:12,859
Go!

877
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:29,045
Patricia!

878
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,890
Listen to me.
We have to get out of here.

879
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:37,552
Patricia never leaves the house!

880
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:39,555
She's coming with me.

881
01:23:39,897 --> 01:23:42,139
You have no right.
Get upstairs.

882
01:23:43,902 --> 01:23:45,396
This is stopping now.

883
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:46,983
What do you mean?

884
01:23:47,406 --> 01:23:49,897
Why do you have
Frank Bannister's knife?

885
01:23:50,243 --> 01:23:52,402
You've been in my room!

886
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,909
Mother!

887
01:24:32,752 --> 01:24:34,828
Mother wants to go to the police.

888
01:24:37,424 --> 01:24:39,084
She'll be down in a minute.

889
01:24:39,426 --> 01:24:43,010
Patricia, we have to go now.
It's not safe here.

890
01:24:43,264 --> 01:24:44,675
Johnny Bartlett is back.

891
01:24:47,102 --> 01:24:48,347
I know.

892
01:24:51,774 --> 01:24:53,601
He visits me at night.

893
01:24:56,613 --> 01:24:58,606
I don't know why he comes.

894
01:24:59,283 --> 01:25:00,943
He torments me.

895
01:25:02,454 --> 01:25:04,447
Why has he come?

896
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,952
Am I being punished?

897
01:25:08,294 --> 01:25:10,501
Patricia, let's just go. Please.

898
01:25:10,547 --> 01:25:12,207
I want to kill her, Patty.

899
01:25:16,303 --> 01:25:20,136
That'll give us 41.
That's 8 clear of Gacy.

900
01:25:20,392 --> 01:25:22,385
Nine more,
we break Bundy's record.

901
01:25:23,061 --> 01:25:26,513
I can't wait to see his face
when he hears the news.

902
01:25:26,607 --> 01:25:28,850
- Yes!
- What?

903
01:25:31,321 --> 01:25:32,982
I'm sorry.

904
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:36,817
We really should wait for Mother.

905
01:25:38,663 --> 01:25:42,329
That asswipe psychic
nearly ruined it for us, Patty.

906
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,664
He made us look stupid.

907
01:25:45,922 --> 01:25:48,330
You'll be okay.
Everything will be fine.

908
01:25:48,675 --> 01:25:53,671
Shut up! That Russian cannibal creep
is telling everyone he did 50 plus.

909
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:58,183
That reflects badly
on both of us, Patty.

910
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:02,430
This record should be held
by an American.

911
01:26:02,692 --> 01:26:04,352
I quite agree.

912
01:26:06,029 --> 01:26:07,358
You can come...

913
01:26:10,201 --> 01:26:11,861
stay with me, if you like.

914
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,448
I'll kill her now.

915
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:15,699
I'd like that.

916
01:26:23,717 --> 01:26:25,710
I'll just get my coat.

917
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:33,895
Patronizing do-gooder bitch!

918
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:37,560
Oh, Patricia.

919
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:41,903
You kill her. I'll watch.

920
01:26:49,748 --> 01:26:51,408
Mrs. Bradley?

921
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:57,587
Mrs. Bradley,
are you coming with us?

922
01:27:01,595 --> 01:27:02,924
Oh, my God.

923
01:27:38,806 --> 01:27:40,135
Lucy!

924
01:27:57,495 --> 01:27:59,322
No, not that way!

925
01:28:27,531 --> 01:28:28,694
Jesus.

926
01:28:34,456 --> 01:28:35,784
These are Bartlett's ashes.

927
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:38,542
We must get them
to the other side.

928
01:28:40,212 --> 01:28:42,704
A church. We have to get them
to a church.

929
01:28:43,466 --> 01:28:45,874
There's a chapel in the old hospital!

930
01:28:50,308 --> 01:28:51,636
No!

931
01:29:09,831 --> 01:29:11,491
Let's go down here.

932
01:29:19,009 --> 01:29:20,254
Where is it?

933
01:29:22,012 --> 01:29:23,672
You look there.

934
01:29:41,035 --> 01:29:42,031
Lucy?

935
01:29:49,879 --> 01:29:51,706
Oh, this is great.

936
01:29:54,384 --> 01:29:55,415
Frank?

937
01:29:58,305 --> 01:30:01,473
Excuse me, Doctor.
We're looking for ward 12.

938
01:30:01,809 --> 01:30:05,642
Go up the stairs to the 4th floor,
then turn right.

939
01:30:05,981 --> 01:30:07,641
It's opposite the chapel.

940
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:10,476
I'll get someone to help.
Orderly!

941
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:12,939
Orderly, are you deaf?

942
01:30:14,324 --> 01:30:16,994
I said, orderly are you deaf?

943
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:20,695
Moron!

944
01:30:29,676 --> 01:30:32,843
I guess that makes you number one.

945
01:30:33,848 --> 01:30:35,128
Get down!

946
01:30:38,353 --> 01:30:40,013
Frank, are you okay?

947
01:30:40,647 --> 01:30:42,640
The chapel's on the fourth floor.

948
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:19,682
Watch out!

949
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,409
We got to go. Go!

950
01:32:10,129 --> 01:32:11,292
Lucy.

951
01:32:13,299 --> 01:32:14,462
Lucy!

952
01:32:37,995 --> 01:32:39,620
You're all the same.

953
01:32:50,343 --> 01:32:51,339
Wait!

954
01:33:53,418 --> 01:33:55,245
Put the gun down, son.

955
01:33:55,587 --> 01:33:57,212
The law is on its way.

956
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,050
What's the score, Patty?

957
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:05,713
Eleven.

958
01:34:06,559 --> 01:34:08,931
That's the same as Starkweather's.

959
01:34:44,312 --> 01:34:45,475
Lucy?

960
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,435
It's jammed.

961
01:34:55,659 --> 01:34:57,985
Take it. Just take it!

962
01:34:59,956 --> 01:35:02,162
Be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

963
01:35:29,032 --> 01:35:30,195
Give that to me.

964
01:35:30,492 --> 01:35:32,152
Let me guess.

965
01:35:32,369 --> 01:35:35,703
You must get these ashes
to consecrated ground...

966
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,532
to destroy the forces of evil.

967
01:35:38,877 --> 01:35:40,870
Give me the goddamn urn!

968
01:35:41,171 --> 01:35:45,715
Under no circumstances
must these ashes ever be released.

969
01:35:50,724 --> 01:35:51,887
Oops.

970
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,511
You have no idea
what you've just done.

971
01:36:00,736 --> 01:36:04,070
You just don't get it,
do you, Frank?

972
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:09,236
This is all about your pathetic need
for self-glorification.

973
01:36:10,915 --> 01:36:13,406
You are such an asshole.

974
01:36:15,087 --> 01:36:18,088
Yes, I am.
I am an asshole...

975
01:36:18,591 --> 01:36:19,587
with an Uzi!

976
01:36:21,928 --> 01:36:24,254
Get up!
You make me sick!

977
01:36:24,598 --> 01:36:25,594
Get up!

978
01:36:26,267 --> 01:36:29,102
I won't shoot you in the back.
Turn around.

979
01:36:29,437 --> 01:36:30,552
I said, turn around!

980
01:36:32,524 --> 01:36:35,894
As a U.S. Government agent,
I order you to turn around!

981
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:24,202
Oh, my God, Frank.

982
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:40,927
Debra.

983
01:38:02,047 --> 01:38:03,043
You killed her.

984
01:38:07,595 --> 01:38:09,588
You're next, pal.

985
01:38:12,434 --> 01:38:14,427
Take him out, baby.

986
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:26,655
Get him!

987
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:29,116
Stop!

988
01:38:36,797 --> 01:38:38,125
Frank, no!

989
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:43,633
Get him, Patty.

990
01:39:09,002 --> 01:39:11,837
Oh, baby, you are an artist.

991
01:39:13,674 --> 01:39:15,833
You're 42!

992
01:39:27,315 --> 01:39:28,311
Yes.

993
01:39:38,662 --> 01:39:40,869
I'm in the mood
for a little vivisection.

994
01:39:41,165 --> 01:39:43,075
No! No, please.

995
01:39:43,167 --> 01:39:44,163
Me, too.

996
01:39:44,878 --> 01:39:46,372
Oh, me, too.

997
01:39:50,885 --> 01:39:52,379
You bitch!

998
01:39:58,561 --> 01:40:01,230
I got your girlfriend, Johnny!

999
01:40:01,898 --> 01:40:03,061
Come get her!

1000
01:40:03,233 --> 01:40:05,060
Goddamn you!
Let go of her!

1001
01:40:05,402 --> 01:40:08,238
Come and get her, you coward!

1002
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:11,906
Let go of my little Patty!

1003
01:40:47,077 --> 01:40:50,078
See you later, Frank!
We got you!

1004
01:40:50,956 --> 01:40:53,744
We're going back down
to get us some more!

1005
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,623
Yo, Frank!

1006
01:40:58,799 --> 01:41:00,459
How's it going?

1007
01:41:03,304 --> 01:41:05,131
Bye, Frank.

1008
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:10,303
Johnny? Johnny!

1009
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:13,472
Step back, Frank.
This won't be pleasant.

1010
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:50,350
The old express bus to hell.
No lines, no waiting.

1011
01:42:00,831 --> 01:42:02,373
It's really something, isn't it?

1012
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:04,869
Excellent libraries.

1013
01:42:05,211 --> 01:42:06,872
Premium cigars.

1014
01:42:07,214 --> 01:42:08,708
And, of course...

1015
01:42:09,383 --> 01:42:10,712
the honeys.

1016
01:42:11,052 --> 01:42:14,717
How about that? Stu's
a regular chick magnet up here.

1017
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:21,726
Hello, Frank.

1018
01:42:24,568 --> 01:42:26,228
It's time to go home.

1019
01:42:27,905 --> 01:42:29,234
I am home.

1020
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:31,568
Ahhh, no.

1021
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:36,905
The authorities have informed us
that it's just not your time.

1022
01:42:38,417 --> 01:42:40,078
Start living, dude.

1023
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:47,921
Be happy.

1024
01:43:44,997 --> 01:43:47,155
There's something
I have to tell you.

1025
01:43:55,843 --> 01:43:57,634
Sorry to interrupt.

1026
01:43:57,678 --> 01:43:59,173
It's all right, Walt.

1027
01:44:01,683 --> 01:44:04,850
Frank, what do you know
about Ouija boards?

1028
01:44:05,145 --> 01:44:06,308
Not a lot.

1029
01:44:06,522 --> 01:44:09,358
I found a stack of them
at the Bradley house.

1030
01:44:09,442 --> 01:44:13,393
Looks like Patricia got herself
a direct line to Bartlett...

1031
01:44:13,489 --> 01:44:15,316
once she was released 5 years ago.

1032
01:44:15,533 --> 01:44:19,116
I thought you and I could collaborate
on a book about this.

1033
01:44:19,162 --> 01:44:21,239
It could be my ticket
off the force.

1034
01:44:21,331 --> 01:44:22,874
That's not my area.

1035
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:25,414
If you need a collaborator,
how about your guardian angel there?

1036
01:44:34,222 --> 01:44:35,550
You got me, Frank.

1037
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:36,719
I got you.

1038
01:44:40,729 --> 01:44:43,565
I'll see you, Frank.
Bye-bye.

1039
01:44:47,905 --> 01:44:50,906
Boy, that Dammers,
he sure looks pissed.

1040
01:44:54,412 --> 01:44:57,912
Sometimes when you go through
a traumatic experience...

1041
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,792
it alters your perception.
