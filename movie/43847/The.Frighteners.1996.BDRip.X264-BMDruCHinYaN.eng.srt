1
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,990
Please.

2
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,060
Please don't hurt me.

3
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,560
It's wrong! She's too young!

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,690
The sins of the flesh will ruin her.

5
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,740
Please don't hurt me! Please!

6
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,700
The wicked will be punished.

7
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,020
"The mystery heart condition...

8
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,890
"that has killed over 30 people in less than four years...

9
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,160
"has claimed another victim. "

10
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,360
"Doctors are baffled

11
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,590
"as to why seemingly fit
and healthy people...

12
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,040
"are suffering
massive heart attacks.

13
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,470
"Many of Fairwater's residents are claiming that the shadow of Death...

14
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,840
"has once again descended
on the town. "

15
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,480
What's this
shadow of Death stuff?
I don't like it.

16
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,570
It's what they're saying,
Miss Rees-Jones.

17
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,240
There's a lot of
scared people out there.

18
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,610
"For decades,

19
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,150
"the name of Fairwater has
been synonymous with Death...

20
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,120
"following the infamous 1964 Bradley-Bartlett murder spree.

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,090
"it appears the Grim Reaper has once again returned...

23
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,660
"to the quiet streets of Fairwater. "

24
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,630
Oh, no.

25
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,000
Steve, no.

26
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,630
I asked for a new angle. Now give me something fresh.

27
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,040
I want to see the human face of this tragedy.

28
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,210
Get out there.
Talk to the families.

29
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,150
I want to know how this thing has impacted on the local community.

30
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,010
Yes, Miss Rees-Jones.

31
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,520
And Steve, no more references to death as a person.

32
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,400
Friend of the family? Really such a shame.

33
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,540
Get out. Go on, get out. Go on.

34
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,340
Get out.

35
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,390
Damn.

36
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,070
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

37
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,940
Oh, my God!

38
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,910
Oh, my God,I don't believe this. This is not happening.

39
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,390
My lawn, you ruptured my lawn.

40
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,390
Whoa.

41
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey. How you doing?

42
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,300
Just give me a call. I'll pay for the damages.

43
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,630
You're damn right
you're gonna pay...

44
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,730
'cause I'm gonna
sue your ass.

45
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,430
Now let's not get litigious,
all right?

46
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,770
Just send me a bill.

47
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,030
"Frank Bannister,
Psychic Investigator"?

48
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,580
That's right.
Well, that's a good one.

49
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,370
How come you didn't see
the corner coming?
You stupid moron.

50
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,440
This is goddamn bullshit!

51
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,080
Listen, buddy,
this is gonna cost you
big time.

52
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,020
You're paying for a new fence,
you hear me?

53
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,820
I want this lawn
completely resurfaced.

54
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,050
Or we're going to talk
about a...

55
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,720
Budzo! My Budzo.

56
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,930
I got
your license plate number,
you bastard!

57
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,610
This is private property.

58
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,330
Mrs. Bradley? I'm Dr. Lynskey.
I work at the medical center.

59
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,990
No, you don't.
I know who works there.

60
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,090
I started there
three months ago.

61
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,460
Dr. Kamins
is my personal physician.

62
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,770
Yes, well, Dr. Kamins
is attending a funeral...

63
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,240
and I'm seeing
his patients today.

64
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,710
She was cutting the vegetables
and the knife slipped.

65
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,010
Well, a couple of stitches
and she'll be fine.

66
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,980
I'll drive you to the clinic.

67
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,780
That's impossible.

68
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,050
It's a deep cut.
Then leave her
some antibiotics.

69
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,180
Mother, please.
Patricia
never leaves the house.

70
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,660
But it hurts.
To your room, this instant!

71
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,730
Wait, just a minute.

72
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,040
Who did that to you?

73
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,570
I think you'd better go now,
Dr. Lynskey.

74
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,450
You don't know
who my daughter is, do you?

75
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,590
Patricia's not to be trusted.
I beg your pardon?

76
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,830
I can have her locked up
anytime I want to.

77
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,540
They said
she was an accessory
after the fact.

78
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,010
I know the truth.

79
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,710
It was cold-blooded murder.

80
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,560
In the space of
27 blood-soaked minutes...

81
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,190
12 innocent people
gunned down...

82
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,740
by hospital orderly
John Charles Bartlett.

83
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,640
Patients, medical staff,
visitors...

84
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,340
no one was spared
in this madman's rampage...

85
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,400
through Fairwater Sanatorium.

86
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,850
Not even the hospital chapel
provided sanctuary...

87
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,610
as those in prayer
were gunned down
on their knees.

88
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,950
For heaven sakes!

89
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,620
We're reporters,
for God's sakes. We're
supposed to get the news.

90
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,890
A seemingly senseless crime.

91
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,420
Bartlett's motive
remains a mystery to this day.

92
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,230
Johnny Bartlett.

93
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,820
He's got a demonic look
on his face.

94
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,370
Can I talk to you?
Later.

95
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,530
Any comments, Johnny?

96
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,800
Got me a score of 12, sir.

97
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,200
That's one more
than Starkweather.

98
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,770
Six years earlier,
Charles Starkweather...

99
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,780
had murdered 11 people
in a Nebraska killing spree.

100
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,910
Guess that makes me
public enemy number one!

101
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,510
Fifteen-year-old
Patricia Ann Bradley...

102
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,890
daughter of the
hospital administrator...

103
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,450
was also implicated
in the killings.

104
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,820
She was madly in love
with the psychopath, Bartlett.

105
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,260
That's her.

106
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,100
I was in her house
this afternoon.

107
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,100
Well, that's just terrific,
honey.

108
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,610
We've been in town
for three months...

109
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,840
and you're making friends
with the Manson Family.

110
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,980
2,200 volts of electricity...

111
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,610
ended the life
of Johnny Bartlett,
the unrepentant killer.

112
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,310
As they threw the switch
he was heard to scream:

113
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,220
"I got me a score of 12.
Beat that. "

114
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,490
In what some considered
a miscarriage of justice...

115
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,400
Patricia Ann Bradley
was sentenced
to life imprisonment...

116
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,460
although it was
never proven that
she actively participated...

117
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,100
in the killings.

118
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,300
Five years ago,
Patricia Bradley was granted
a conditional release...

119
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,000
by the State Governor.

120
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,210
Today
she lives a reclusive life
back in the family home...

121
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,090
Should've fried her
when they fried Bartlett.

122
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,320
She was 15 years old,
you know.

123
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,690
She just fell in love
with the wrong guy.

124
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,090
It could happen to anyone.

125
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,490
Sweetie, I don't want
you going back up there.

126
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,720
The place gives me the creeps.

127
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,160
I really don't think
that you should...

128
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,790
Come on, honey.

129
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,170
I think Tiger's getting
a little lonely.

130
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,450
Guess what I did tonight,
honey?

131
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,210
I made reservations
at Excalibur.

132
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,220
Don't you remember,
sweetheart?

133
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,380
It's our anniversary
this Tuesday.

134
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,360
I even got our favorite table.

135
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,290
Yeah? You silly-willy?

136
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,380
What the hell
is this doing here?

137
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,440
I thought I tore this up.

138
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,710
Did he come back to the house?
Who?

139
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,310
That moron
that tore up my fence!

140
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,890
Help! Ray, help.

141
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,230
He's alive.

142
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,740
Ray!

143
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Ray, get me off!

144
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,850
You sick thing!

145
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,770
Lucy, I don't want
that con man in my house.

146
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,310
There's gotta be some kind of rational explanation for all this.

147
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,250
I just don't want some goddamn spoon bender telling me what to do.

148
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,180
Ray, we have got
a poltergeist!

149
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,190
Well, it's nothing
that the police can't handle.

150
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,870
Bannister.

151
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,000
Dr. Lynskey, I'm on my way.

152
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,110
Persistent residue
of the departed. Always
a problem this time of year.

153
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,280
Dr. Lynskey?

154
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,760
Yes. Thank you for coming.
The...

155
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,190
The activity is currently
located where?

156
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,060
Well, I don't know.
It just went quiet
about five minutes ago.

157
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,470
Went quiet?

158
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,560
The dining room table
spun in
a counterclockwise direction?

159
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,400
I don't think
that one happened. No.

160
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,340
The toilet seat lid
banged up and down?

161
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,440
No.

162
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,270
Did the bed levitate?
Yeah, with me on it.

163
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,520
Spontaneous
recurrent psychokinesis.
Oh, boy.

164
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,220
This could be the worst case
I've ever seen.

165
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,950
Yeah, this is bad.

166
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,920
Okay. Well, folks,
I can do a clearance...

167
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,130
but it's not gonna be cheap.

168
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,570
Although I do offer
a six-month guarantee.

169
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,900
How much?

170
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,640
$249.95.

171
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,900
But there is a 30% surcharge
for making a house call
after midnight.

172
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,910
Then there's vehicle, gas...

173
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,070
so I'd say the whole thing
is gonna set you back...

174
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,140
somewhere in
the neighborhood of $450.

175
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,190
Although we could forget
about the fence,
call the whole thing even.

176
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,990
Do it.

177
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,460
Okay. Excuse me, ma'am.
You wanna stand back.

178
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,730
I don't want you
to have to sign a waiver.

179
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,360
Plus $100 for materials.
I can't be out of pocket.

180
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,240
Just do it,
for Christ's sakes, Bannister.

181
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,540
Here we go.

182
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,470
All righty.

183
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,820
Why us? I mean,
why are they in our house?

184
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,280
All I can tell you is
emanations are normally
confined to the cemetery...

185
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,690
although they do escape.

186
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,380
It's usually the young ones.

187
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,550
For God's sakes, Bannister,
come on.

188
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,790
Come on.

189
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,830
It's holy water.

190
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,380
This is bullshit.
This is total bullshit.

191
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,590
Come on. Yes!

192
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,220
Okay, these belong to you.

193
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,490
Six ectoplasmic emanations.

194
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,430
Don't worry.
They can't escape.

195
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,130
Some people like a souvenir.
Where would you like me
to put them?

196
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,200
No. I really don't think
we wanna hang onto those.

197
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,760
So, thank you.

198
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,430
Do we, hon?
I could give a rat's ass.

199
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,070
Okay.

200
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,820
Don't worry,
they can't feel a thing.

201
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,410
At least that's what it says
in the book.

202
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,820
You never really know
for sure.

203
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,620
All right.
Thank you, Bannister.
You can go.

204
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,030
What the hell
are you staring at?

205
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,770
What's with the number?

206
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,240
What number?

207
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,910
Look, if you're trying
to freak me out,
it's not gonna work, okay?

208
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,110
You know
what he's trying to do?

209
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,950
He's trying
to get more money out of us
is what he's trying to do.

210
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,320
Here, take your shit
and get the hell
out of my house.

211
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,620
Come on.

212
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,950
Move.
Ray, just...

213
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,520
Thank you so much.

214
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,200
There you go.
Thanks.

215
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,600
Thank you.

216
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,540
Why do you always
have to alienate everybody?

217
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,330
I think I'm going to throw up.

218
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,830
Damn.

219
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,750
Man, I hate that trunk!

220
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,350
Yeah, I don't want you guys
spreading
your ectoplasmic muck...

221
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,590
all over my car seats.

222
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,500
Ain't that a bitch.
The ectoplasm's the only thing
sticky enough...

223
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,970
to hold the damn car together.

224
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,270
Look, Frank, I'm sorry
about your pus yellow,
piece-of-shit Volvo...

225
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,430
but we ain't riding
in the damn trunk no more,
you understand?

226
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,670
We would like to cruise
with some style, man.

227
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,810
You know, you guys
left me high and dry tonight.

228
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,250
I get to the house,
nothing's happening.

229
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,910
I couldn't believe it.

230
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,180
Stuart, in or out?

231
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,290
You guys didn't even
bang the toilet seat lid?

232
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,830
You made me
look like an asshole.

233
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,350
We strained our backs
lifting that heavy ass bed,
Frank.

234
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,230
Yeah. Who was the idiot...

235
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,700
who put the number
in the guy's forehead?

236
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,940
It wasn't funny.

237
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,530
Start pulling your weight,
guys...

238
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,300
or you're going back
to the cemetery.

239
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,470
Yeah, well,
you can pull this, Frank.

240
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,980
I'm about to go like Jesse
on your ass.

241
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,780
I'm gonna find me
some other black ghosts...

242
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,780
and then organize a march.

243
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,790
The African American
Apparition Coalition.

244
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,360
The AAAC.

245
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,050
And I'm gonna tell you
something, Frank!

246
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,790
There ain't nothing worse
than a bunch
of pissed off brothers...

247
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,520
that's already dead!

248
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,290
Would someone help me, please?

249
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,700
Stu, man,
you got to loosen up, man.
I'm serious.

250
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,360
Come on, Stu, loosen up.

251
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,670
Loosen up. Okay, you loose?
All right.

252
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,910
So tight you can you play
pick-up sticks
with your butt cheeks.

253
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,580
Loosen up. Just particlise.
There you go.

254
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,580
Damn.

255
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,320
That fellow takes us
totally for granted.

256
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,760
And we're supposed to be
his business partners.

257
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,500
What a joke.
I'm gonna straighten him out
first thing in the morning.

258
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,630
He's dealing
with a double major here.

259
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,400
Well, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
I'm gonna get rough.

260
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,870
You talking to me, Stuart?
No.

261
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,910
See, Stuart,
that's your problem.
You're too soft with him.

262
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,180
You gotta just
walk up to Frank, just
look him in the eye and say:

263
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,380
"Frank, give me what I want
or I'm gonna bust your ass!"

264
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,410
Yo, Frank, how's it hanging?

265
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,200
I don't know, Cyrus.
You tell me.

266
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,410
Well, Frank, I'll tell you
the women
ain't missing nothing.

267
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,010
Come on. I told you guys,
stay the hell
out of my plumbing.

268
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,950
Look. Come on, Frank.

269
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,890
Look, we wanna call a meeting,
man. We gotta rap.

270
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,450
Cyrus, I gotta take a leak...

271
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,450
and I'm not getting out
of the shower.

272
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,520
Goodbye.

273
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,100
Therefore, a happy ghost
is a productive ghost.

274
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,930
To that end, I've drawn up
a list of suggestions.

275
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,340
Now bear in mind, Frank...

276
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,670
that we have given you
five years of loyal service.

277
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,140
Flies.
That's what you've given me,
Stuart. Flies.

278
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,280
Why is it that flies
stick to you guys
like shit to a blanket?

279
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,580
Very funny.
You a funny guy, Frank.

280
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,450
You know, all you think about
is yourself.

281
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,020
You know, I can complain, too,
you know.

282
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,360
I would like some new clothes.
You get to dress nice.

283
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,560
Here I am still looking like
Linc from The Mod Squad.

284
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,860
You died in the '70s.
It's a bummer.

285
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,400
I think what Cyrus
is attempting to say, Frank...

286
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,400
is that we don't feel
that the enterprise
is evolving...

287
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,270
in quite the manner
in which we all agree.

288
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,670
Please don't
reach through me...

289
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,870
when I'm trying to speak
to you.

290
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,850
Now, Frank,
we gotta talk about cigars.

291
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,160
Cigars?
Damn right.

292
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,290
You've been promising me a box
for I don't know how long.

293
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,800
Cyrus, I hate to
break this to you
but you're dead, you know.

294
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,890
You can't smoke.

295
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,830
Well, you can light them up
and blow the smoke in my face.

296
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,740
If I light up a cigar,
I'll blow my lunch
in your face.

297
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,800
Everybody, get down!
Damn it, Judge!

298
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,090
Put the shooters away.

299
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,620
That was a head shot, Frank.
He could have killed me.

300
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,860
You know, if I wanted
to get shot at every day...

301
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,460
I'd move my black ass
to Los Angeles!

302
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,880
When a man's jawbone
drops off...

303
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,680
it's time
to reassess the situation.

304
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,560
I got myself
a nice little grave...

305
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,060
up there at the cemetery.

306
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,000
It could soon be time
to lay my bones.

307
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,330
No, you're my go-to guy.
Without you,
I'm out of business, Judge.

308
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,180
Frightening...

309
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,300
it's a young man's game,
Frank.

310
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,110
I ain't got no more hauntings
left in me.

311
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,750
What are you talking about?
You're in...

312
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,190
great shape.

313
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,490
My joints are getting powdery.

314
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,160
The dog's running away
with my face.
Hell, I'm falling apart.

315
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,420
You've been falling apart
for years.

316
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,660
Don't go saying nothing
to the boys...

317
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,770
but my ectoplasm
is all dried up.

318
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,610
I'm sorry to hear that, Judge.

319
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,910
Give it up, Frank.

320
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,380
Death ain't no way
to make a living.

321
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,390
Yeah, well, Judge,
I gotta finish this house.

322
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,050
You ain't never gonna finish
this house.

323
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,520
You ain't never
gonna finish nothing!

324
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,820
You're fooling yourself,
Frank!

325
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,190
Too many skeletons
in the closet.

326
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,200
It's us, Frank.

327
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,080
What do you think?
Pretty scary, huh?

328
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,680
Don't you ever do that again.

329
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,290
Say, maybe we should try
a white sheet next time.

330
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,160
Ain't gonna be
no white sheets, bro.

331
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,700
Good morning, Zack.
Frank.

332
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,340
Okay, you guys wanna talk,
let's talk.

333
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,320
Let's talk about this.
This is a letter from my bank.

334
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,650
This says they want
$15,000 from me or
they're gonna sell my house.

335
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,750
Well, cool.

336
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,790
It's about time
we ditched
this drafty-ass crib...

337
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,880
and moved to someplace nice
with some glass
in the windows.

338
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,790
Cyrus, this is serious shit,
okay?

339
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,350
This is my house.
I'm not losing it.

340
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,160
Stuart.

341
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,830
The chicken.
The chicken was not scary,
Stuart...

342
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,230
the chicken was stupid.

343
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,470
Judge, help me out here, okay?

344
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,170
Talk to these guys.
They look up to you,
all right? Thanks.

345
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,710
I need $15,000, guys.
I need it quick.

346
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,350
It is time
to get seriously scary.

347
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,810
So you checked
the place out, right?

348
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,620
Right.
Cool.

349
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,450
How many we got in here?
Five.

350
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,620
They won't suspect a thing.

351
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,030
Poor suckers,
they won't even know
what hit them.

352
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,830
How many exits?
Two.

353
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,900
All right, man, this is it.
We gotta be hard. No mercy.

354
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,040
We're going in
like professionals,
like Charles Bronson.

355
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,110
We don't stop
till the screaming starts,
you dig?

356
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,650
I'm with you.

357
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,410
Let's go.

358
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,910
Yeah.

359
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,690
Let's kick some ass.

360
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,550
Here we go.
One, two, three...

361
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,460
Good morning,
my darlings. Hello.

362
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,230
The mail's on the table,
Mrs. Waterhouse.

363
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,820
Thank you, Sylvia.

364
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,430
Sylvia, Mother is coming
for lunch. Pick up, quick.

365
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,140
Yes, ma'am.

366
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,740
Big kiss.

367
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,610
All right, kid,
quit jumping around
and acting like a baby.

368
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,740
This is serious.

369
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,950
Now, we're gonna scare
the living daylights
out of your parents.

370
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,880
So, come on, kid,
you gonna help us out?

371
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,290
Are you with us?

372
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,260
See? He gets it.
The kids always get it.

373
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,420
Let's go.
All right.

374
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,830
Mrs. Waterhouse.

375
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,200
Mrs. Waterhouse!

376
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,310
Damn. Here, man.
This one did le poo-poo.

377
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,510
Get it away from me.
Man, they're so little...

378
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,980
but their doo-doo
smells like old shoes.

379
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,180
Mrs. Waterhouse!

380
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,950
My babies!

381
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,590
Yeah, Frank Bannister.

382
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,670
I'm on my way.

383
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,560
Judge, I need you
riding shotgun.

384
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,300
Yes.

385
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,640
Damn it! Come on, let's go.

386
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,310
Come on. D for drive.

387
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,980
Look around you, Frank.
Don't you realize
what's happening?

388
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,890
Yeah, every other car
is a frigging hearse.

389
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,190
Come on,
I can't even get across town.

390
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,560
This town is in deep trouble.

391
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,420
Yeah, too many funerals,
not enough traffic lights.

392
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,360
It's Death, Frank.

393
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,060
Death is amongst us.

394
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,310
Come on, let's go.
Time is money.

395
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,540
You haven't heard
a goddamn word I've said!

396
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,510
I thought you had
some character, son...

397
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,980
but right now
you're not showing me much.

398
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,310
You're right, Judge.
Watch this.

399
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,920
Look out.

400
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,900
What's the matter, Judge?
You look a little pale.

401
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,340
Beautiful.

402
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,780
Beautiful, Judge.
This is gonna be easy.

403
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,010
Why don't
you just rest your bones?
I'll be right back.

404
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,920
Ma'am.

405
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,860
Persistent residue
of the departed.

406
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,190
It's always a problem
this time of year.

407
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,130
Frank Bannister,
I believe you called.

408
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,430
Not a minute too soon.
Oh, boy.

409
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,170
Frank, she just...
Shut up.

410
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,330
Frank, it's no use. She...

411
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,810
This is bad.

412
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,140
Recurrent
spontaneous psychokinesis.

413
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,700
Yeah, this could be
the worst case I have ever...

414
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,210
...seen.

415
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,450
I apologize for calling you,
Mr. Bannister.

416
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,650
Please leave.

417
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,750
What the hell
are you trying to do to me?

418
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,700
Preying on the bereaved
is about as low as you can go.

419
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,100
You're a parasite,
Mr. Bannister,
and people should be warned.

420
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,110
Yeah, well, I got a right
to offer my services
to the public.

421
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,540
In case you hadn't noticed...

422
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,010
we are in the midst
of a major health crisis.

423
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,550
The last thing the people
of Fairwater need is some...

424
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,670
two-bit charlatan promising
to pass on bogus messages...

425
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,150
from the other side.

426
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,310
Now, if you will excuse me.

427
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,960
I'm just trying
to make a living.
Living?

428
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,990
Not a word you'd know
a lot about.
Is it, Mr. Bannister?

429
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,060
Easy.

430
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,200
Asshole.

431
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,810
You all right, buddy?

432
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,320
Man, you took quite a fall.

433
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,050
Bannister!
Yeah.

434
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,560
Listen, you gotta help.

435
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,420
They're gonna bury me, man.
You gotta help.

436
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,020
Bannister,
what is happening to me?

437
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, Ray,
you appear to be dead.

438
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,760
Don't say that.
That's impossible.
I'm in the prime of my life.

439
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,770
I work out every single day.
My wife's a goddamn doctor!

440
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,330
Why didn't
you take the corridor?
What corridor?

441
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,000
The corridor of life.
The passageway
to the other side.

442
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,410
Because I don't belong
on the other side!

443
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,380
Jesus Christ, I'm only 29.

444
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,350
Hey, hey, hey.

445
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,410
Look, Ray...

446
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,250
just relax, all right?

447
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,650
You wanna tell me
what happened?

448
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,310
I was on the rowing machine...

449
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,120
and then suddenly
I felt this viselike grip...

450
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,090
just squeezing my heart
and I couldn't breathe, Frank.

451
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,390
I just couldn't breathe
and...

452
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,870
I've got the shakes now.
I need some vitamin B.

453
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,530
Yeah, you can't take
vitamins anymore.

454
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,800
You don't eat,
you don't drink,
you don't go to the bathroom.

455
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,370
All that shit's over with.

456
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,310
In about a year's time
you're gonna get a chance...

457
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,680
to go through
the other side again.

458
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,580
To become what's known
as a pure spirit.

459
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,480
But in the meantime,
you're what's known as
an earthbound emanation...

460
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,920
which is a rotting cloud
of bioplasmic particles...

461
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,290
dripping ectoplasm
from every orifice.

462
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,060
Relax, Ray.

463
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,770
All right, Bannister...

464
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,840
can you at least
give me a ride
so I don't miss my funeral?

465
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,450
Okay, Ray, listen up.

466
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,920
The cemetery
is not a safe place,
all right? So stay close.

467
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,390
Later, Bannister.
I want to hear
what they're saying about me.

468
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,330
Don't worry about them.
They're not gonna hurt you.

469
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,430
What in the hell
is going on out here?

470
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,540
Get back in your graves!

471
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,680
Son of a...
Holy Jesus!

472
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,780
Frank Bannister!
Go ahead. I'll handle this.

473
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,780
What the hell are you doing
in my graveyard?

474
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,150
You have been told
to stay away!

475
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,320
Sound off
like you've got a pair!

476
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,830
Yeah, well,
it's a public place, Hiles.

477
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,330
I do not like you!

478
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,760
You cannot bring your spooks
in here without my permission!

479
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,560
Disappear, scumbag!

480
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,480
I am not one of
your shitty little emanations,
Bannister.

481
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,850
You cannot
push spirits around.

482
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,220
You are scum!
Using spooks to
put the frighteners on people!

483
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,650
That makes me physically ill!

484
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,150
We got a lot of lowlifes
around here!

485
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,130
And I will provide
an armed response
at the first sign of trouble!

486
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,100
They must be contained!

487
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,130
Catch you later, Hiles.

488
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,970
My tour of duty
runs another 85 years!

489
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,070
There's a piece of dirt
up here with your name on it,
Bannister!

490
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,780
I'm waiting for you,
you little maggot!

491
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,880
There were times
when people have accused Ray
of being...

492
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,390
less than generous,
but I'm sure, deep down...

493
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,550
the man possessed
a heart of gold
and a generous spirit.

494
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,270
It's true.

495
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,070
He wouldn't lie.
Not at a time like this.

496
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,010
Because God has chosen
to call our brother Ray...

497
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,070
from this life to Himself...

498
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,410
we commit his body
to the ground.

499
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,390
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

500
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,720
Jesus, what a waste.

501
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,760
The Lord bless him
and keep him.
It's a goddamn tragedy.

502
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,560
The Lord lift up
His countenance upon him
and give him peace.

503
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,160
Goodbye, Ray.

504
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,560
Sweetheart, don't cry.

505
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,300
Oh, shit!

506
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,500
Frank!

507
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,370
I know you can hear me.

508
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,870
Get me out of this hole,
Bannister.

509
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,600
Frank.

510
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,540
Get me
out of this hole, please.
Hiya, Frank.

511
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,840
Hey, Walt.
Kind of surprised to see you.

512
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,010
Here on business, I guess?
Not exactly.

513
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,620
Bannister, they're gonna
bury me alive in here.

514
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,890
I understand you and Lynskey
had a little run-in...

515
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,930
the night before he died.

516
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,660
As a matter of fact,
apart from his wife...

517
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,820
I believe
you were the last person
to see him alive.

518
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,060
It sounds like
you're the one
who's here on business, Walt.

519
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,730
No.

520
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,740
The FBI is very concerned
about these deaths.

521
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,100
They look like heart attacks
but when they slice
these people open...

522
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,610
their arteries
are just clean as a whistle.

523
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,210
But there's been
this tremendous pressure
on the heart...

524
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,550
like the life
has just been crushed
right out of it.

525
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,290
You got any theories, Frank?
Bannister!

526
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,620
Mind if I pay my last respects
before they fill him in?

527
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,220
No. I'm sorry.

528
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,240
Bannister, please.

529
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,580
I need to be cheered up.

530
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,420
Mr. Bannister?

531
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,860
Mr. Bannister,
did you want to see me?

532
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,930
Oh, my God, Frank.
She can see me.

533
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,730
I thought perhaps
you might have a message
from Ray.

534
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,230
Tell her.
Tell her I'm here, Frank.
Tell her.

535
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,880
I mean, everyone says
that you're a fraud...

536
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,140
but I've seen
what you can do.

537
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,910
Frank!

538
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,890
You must think
I'm very stupid.

539
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,620
Excuse me.

540
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,160
Lucy...

541
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,130
Ray says
he loves you very much.

542
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,880
Here you are.
Here's your table.

543
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,180
Hi.
Hi.

544
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,720
Is Ray with us?

545
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,020
Yeah.

546
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,380
Tell her she looks great.

547
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,730
He says that you look great.

548
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,500
Tell her they're from me.
Oh, those are from Ray.

549
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,200
It's our anniversary.

550
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,800
Right. He says
it's your anniversary.

551
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,910
Is Ray beside me?

552
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,750
He's over here.

553
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,950
Greetings.
How are you this evening?

554
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,660
May I offer you some wine?

555
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,390
I don't know.
Lucy, do you want some,
what, red, white?

556
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,630
Red, we always have red.

557
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,670
White.
I've never been fond of red.

558
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,700
Lucy!

559
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,310
So you used to be
an architect?

560
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,640
A long time ago.
Can it, Bannister.

561
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,510
She doesn't want to hear
your life story.

562
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,110
Wow. So did you
build your own house?

563
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,110
I mean, you must have
a dream home.

564
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,420
You could call it
a dream home.

565
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,220
I'm gonna build you
a dream home, sweetheart...

566
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,890
just as soon as
I get on my feet.

567
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,050
Yeah.

568
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,730
Tell me, why is it that
you can see Ray and I can't?

569
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,730
I was in an accident,
a car accident...

570
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,340
about five years ago.

571
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,970
I don't know. They say that...

572
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,740
sometimes when you have
a traumatic experience...

573
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,720
that it can
alter your perception.

574
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,550
Really, so after that
you could just see spirits?

575
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,490
I mean, what happened?

576
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,420
How about you talk to Ray?
That's why I'm here.

577
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,230
Finally,
I'm in the conversation.
Terrific.

578
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,200
Well, actually I do have
an important question...

579
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,030
that I have to ask Ray.

580
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,970
Well, he can hear you.

581
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,550
Ray, I really need to know
where you invested my money...

582
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,820
the $16,000 that I had saved.

583
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,220
The attorneys can't seem
to find it anywhere.

584
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,950
Shit. I blew it
on a bad investment.

585
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,500
But don't tell her that.
I'll think of something.

586
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,830
It's gone, Lucy.
It's gone. He blew it
on a bad investment.

587
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,300
You asshole!

588
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,460
Tell her
everything's gonna be okay.

589
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,030
I'm gonna look out for her.
I'm gonna move back
into the house.

590
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,600
Tell her that.
No, that's not a good idea.

591
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,730
Bannister,
this doesn't concern you.

592
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,610
What's Ray saying?
What's he saying?

593
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,740
He left. Ray left.

594
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,380
He said he was sorry,
but he wanted
to leave you alone...

595
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,850
let you get on with your life.

596
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,010
I swear to God, Bannister,
I'm gonna kill you.

597
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,990
I can't believe it, I mean...

598
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,620
That's just like Ray
to just take the money
and run. I...

599
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,430
Ray and I haven't been
honest with each other...

600
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,730
in a long time, Mr. Bannister.

601
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,530
It wasn't what you would call
a good marriage.

602
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,410
You bitch!

603
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,880
Lucy, it's gonna be okay.

604
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,520
Get your hands off my wife!

605
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,290
Goddamn it!

606
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,050
Sorry.

607
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,160
I can move shit, Bannister.

608
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,530
Man, you better
watch your back.

609
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,660
I better clean this up.
I'll be right back.

610
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,710
Good food, huh?

611
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,930
Yeah, it's great.

612
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,410
Mom!

613
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,780
Looks like
another heart attack...

614
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,280
but I can't confirm it
till the autopsy.

615
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,440
Damn.

616
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,350
The waiter says
he saw this guy
coming out of the john...

617
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,580
about five minutes
before the body was found.

618
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,350
And who might that have been?
Frank Bannister.

619
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,260
He was as white as a sheet
and shaking.

620
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,760
Waiter thought
he'd been sick.
Damn.

621
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,460
Hi, Lucy.

622
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,760
Lucy?

623
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,090
No.

624
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,500
Dr. Lynskey works for me.
We're colleagues.

625
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,560
Look, Doc,
she's a material witness,
all right?

626
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,510
Okay.

627
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,280
Walt, Bannister was last seen
in the restaurant parking lot.

628
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,450
He took off at high speed.

629
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:08,890
Bring him in.

630
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,000
Look at that.

631
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,490
So your dead husband
was having dinner with you
at the restaurant?

632
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,270
What did he order?

633
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,210
Oh, God. Excuse me.

634
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,310
Timmy.

635
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,630
Timmy, front desk, please.

636
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,370
Thank you.

637
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,300
Lucy, this is Special Agent
Milton Dammers of the FBI.

638
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,280
I came by train.

639
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,950
I was going to take the flight
but I didn't feel good
about the plane.

640
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,750
At what time precisely...

641
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,280
did Bannister leave
for the bathroom?

642
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,350
You.

643
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm not sure, precisely.

644
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,060
Did he use excessive amounts
of table salt during his meal?

645
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,130
What?
Answer the question.

646
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,770
For Christ's sakes,
it's really late.

647
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,470
I can't remember that, okay?

648
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,150
Oh, God. What is this?

649
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,110
Excuse me, Lucy,
I'll be right back.

650
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,290
Milton?

651
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,590
Sorry, Sheriff.

652
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:31,170
I have a problem
with women yelling.

653
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,230
Milton,
can I get you anything?

654
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,500
Sheriff Perry!

655
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,000
You are violating
my territorial bubble.

656
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:52,020
Lucy, you're still grieving.

657
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,190
It would be very easy
for a man like Frank Bannister
to take advantage.

658
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,790
You have such closed minds.
I can't believe it.

659
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,260
I object.

660
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,860
Special Agent Dammers...

661
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,770
has over 20 years experience
in the area...

662
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,170
of paranormal psychology.

663
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,740
Much of that was spent
undercover with various...

664
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,840
cults and sects.

665
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,580
I get all the fruity cases,
Mrs. Lynskey.

666
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,260
For God's sake, Milton,
would you come inside
and sit down?

667
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,020
I'm more comfortable standing.
Thank you.

668
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,490
I really don't see
what this has to do
with Frank Bannister.

669
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,960
Mrs. Lynskey, you know nothing
about Frank Bannister.

670
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,300
You claim
he's a bona fide psychic...

671
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,200
yet all I've heard
is a lot of ill-informed,
meandering waffle.

672
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,200
On the third day
of July 1990...

673
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,600
Frank Bannister,
then a successful architect...

674
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,740
was overseeing
the construction
of his new home.

675
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,840
Now, the building contractor,
Jacob Platz,
would later confirm...

676
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,360
that Bannister
had been consuming alcohol
that morning.

677
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,890
12:23 p. m.,
Platz sees Bannister...

678
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,830
in a heated argument
with his wife, Debra.

679
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,700
It appears that Bannister
had promised Debra a garden...

680
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,100
in the new home...

681
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,760
and then,
without consulting her,
proceeded to lay...

682
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,000
a four-inch
thick concrete slab...

683
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,770
creating a basketball court
for himself.

684
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,480
12:31 p. M...

685
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,050
Platz watches the couple
drive away.

686
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,750
Bannister kept a tool box
in the back of his car.

687
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,120
And in it was a utility knife
with a retractable blade.

688
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:41,490
Bannister purchased
seven new blades...

689
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,620
that morning...

690
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,600
at Jesson's Hardware Store
and Building Supply...

691
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,300
on the corner
of 3rd and Garrett.
3rd and Garrett.

692
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,900
Third of July.

693
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,540
Seven blades. Three.

694
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,110
Milton...

695
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,710
you're mumbling.
We can't understand a word
you're saying.

696
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,250
12:33 p. M...

697
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,520
and their '84 Volvo
heads into the hills.

698
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,390
It is the last time anyone
will see the couple together.

699
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,890
Now, by Bannister's
own admission, the argument
continues to rage...

700
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,760
reaching a climactic point
when Debra demands
that Bannister stop...

701
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,240
pull over, let her out.

702
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,600
And at that moment,
probably 12:36, 12:37 p. M...

703
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,510
the car leaves the road
on a sharp curve...

704
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,310
presumably because Bannister
was driving too fast.

705
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,340
She was killed?

706
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,380
Her body was found
some 15 yards from the car.

707
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,180
Now, Bannister...

708
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,790
he was picked up
two hours later,
wandering in the woods.

709
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,690
He claimed
to have no recollection
of the events that occurred...

710
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,500
after the accident.

711
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,770
But here's the odd thing,
Mrs. Lynskey.

712
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,900
His utility knife was missing.

713
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:03,210
And to this day
it has not been found.

714
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,880
But do you know
what was really bizarre?

715
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,950
Debra's corpse
had the number 13...

716
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,020
carved into its forehead.

717
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,390
Unlucky for some.

718
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,570
Come on.
You're out of your mind.

719
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,470
You're talking about
a mythical figure.

720
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,570
A pseudo-religious icon
from the 12th century.

721
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,710
Save your pea brain prattle
for the classroom, boy.

722
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,510
That was the soul collector...

723
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:46,750
and he's been
taking people out
since time began.

724
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:51,720
He's going about
some dark business
here in Fairwater...

725
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,660
and we ain't nothing
but worm bait.

726
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,740
When your number's up,
that's it.

727
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,740
There's another one gone.

728
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:03,200
He's gone.

729
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,840
There's no money for you here,
Mr. Bannister.

730
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,940
You're next.

731
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,310
Are you threatening me?

732
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,570
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

733
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:17,170
He's threatening to kill me.
Just relax, all right?

734
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,440
Just listen to me and...
He's threatening to kill me.

735
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,450
Bannister!
Great.

736
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,190
Okay.
Excuse me.

737
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,920
What are you doing?

738
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,510
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

739
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,390
Put the gun away, all right?
Freeze.

740
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,160
All right, everybody,
just take it easy.

741
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,810
Just stay there, Bannister.
Just stay there.

742
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,210
Yes.

743
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,050
Great.

744
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,390
I did it.

745
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,390
Judge.

746
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,860
Bannister, stop.

747
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:08,920
Looks like I ain't shooting
with blanks no more.

748
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,760
Mighty fine woman.

749
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,300
Good teeth.

750
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,500
Now put your hands
on the podium.

751
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,170
Judge.
Stay down!

752
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,550
They don't call me
the hanging judge for nothing.

753
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,420
Stay right there.

754
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,090
Heads up.

755
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,900
Good catch.

756
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,150
Freeze!

757
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,460
Good shooting, Tex.

758
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,470
And she was so young
and beautiful!

759
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,410
I like it
when they lie still like that.

760
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,210
This is heavy.

761
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,430
My juices are flowing again.

762
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,170
Judge!

763
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,180
Bannister!

764
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,840
Go, Frank.
Just get out of here now.

765
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,140
Bastard!

766
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:08,710
Gotta go.

767
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,760
Bannister!
Stop.

768
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,820
Whoa! Whoa!

769
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,440
Damn. Come on.

770
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,560
Just get down.
Get down and stay down.

771
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,830
Oh, no.

772
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,810
Magda!
No!

773
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,640
Listen to me.

774
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,150
No!

775
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,130
No!

776
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,700
Oh, no.

777
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,210
You killed me, you bastard!

778
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,120
You're sick. Is this how
you get your kicks?

779
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,160
Did it feel good killing me?

780
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:45,320
Bannister, did it feel good
killing your wife?

781
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,390
You're a murderer!

782
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:04,440
I don't believe
he'll get very far. We've got
the state line covered.

783
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,880
Sheriff Perry...

784
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,950
I seriously doubt we will see
Mr. Bannister any time soon.

785
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,860
The man is resourceful beyond
anything you can comprehend.

786
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,890
Hello, Frank.
Hi, Walt.

787
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,630
I've come to report
that Magda Rees-Jones'...

788
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,540
body is lying near my car...

789
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,470
off Holloway Road.

790
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,280
Frank, did you have anything
to do with her death?

791
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,410
Frank!

792
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:44,910
Frank, are you okay?
What happened?

793
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:48,120
What are you doing?

794
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,880
Are you arresting him?
Please leave, Mrs. Lynskey.

795
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,190
Frank. Frank,
you need a lawyer.

796
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,790
Go home, Lucy.

797
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:57,890
But you haven't done anything.
He hasn't done anything.

798
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:59,330
How do you know?

799
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,200
Do you know me?

800
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,100
Am I a nice guy, Lucy?
'Cause...

801
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:09,240
that cozy little scene
in the restaurant
was bullshit, 'cause...

802
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,650
I was doing my job.

803
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,020
And I don't give a damn
about you. I don't give
a damn about anybody.

804
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,820
What the hell are you saying?
Go home.

805
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,310
Okay.

806
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:29,530
Lucy, are you okay to drive?
Yeah.

807
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,510
Got a kiss for honey bunny?

808
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,380
I know, I know.
It's the way I look.
It's this...

809
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,750
damn ectoplasm stuff.

810
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,460
It turns you off,
doesn't it?

811
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,330
Come on, Lucy,
you're not listening to me!

812
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,230
Look, baby, you know
we have a great relationship.

813
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,360
It's just that...

814
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:05,730
lately I don't feel that
you've been giving 100%.

815
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:12,300
There has been
a destructive force unleashed
on this town...

816
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,070
such as I have never seen.

817
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:19,980
We have a body count of...

818
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:23,820
twenty-eight.

819
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,880
You're a very dangerous man,
Mr. Bannister.

820
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,260
For Christ's sake...

821
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,060
you're not seriously
suggesting that Frank
is responsible for...

822
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,030
You're way out of your depth
here, Sheriff Perry.

823
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,700
Please leave.

824
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,760
Frank Bannister
is my prisoner.

825
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:46,140
By the power invested in me
by the President
of the United States...

826
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:47,680
I am telling you...

827
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:50,970
to get the hell
out of this room.

828
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,780
Have you ever heard
of Nina Kulagina?

829
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:32,820
March 10, 1970. Nina Kulagina
with the power of her mind...

830
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:35,150
stopped the beat
of a frog's heart.

831
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:38,620
The record of this experiment
is currently held...

832
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,820
in the files
of Prof. Gennady Sergeyev...

833
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,060
of Saint Petersburg.

834
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,100
And as Sergeyev
interpreted this cardiogram...

835
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:50,070
it seemed to him that
the heart had experienced...

836
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,730
a sudden flare-up
of electrical activity.

837
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,830
The heart imploded,
the arteries burst...

838
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:57,750
and all because Nina Kulagina
wanted the animal dead.

839
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,640
I don't kill people.

840
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,590
There's a part of you
that believes that.

841
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:14,720
There's another part of you,
Frank...

842
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:16,700
that's out of control.

843
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,770
Your destructive impulse.

844
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,970
I've seen a figure in a cape.

845
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:30,210
I've seen him reach
into people's chests
and squeeze their hearts.

846
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:33,720
Who was it?

847
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,550
Who was it?

848
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,650
Death.

849
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,590
I can communicate
with the other side.

850
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,530
I can see spirits.

851
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,770
I don't know why.
I can't understand it.

852
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,910
You think you're quite unique,
don't you, Mr. Bannister?

853
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:07,040
But in my business,
I deal with your type
every other week.

854
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,540
This Death figure...

855
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:14,260
is nothing more
than a homicidal alter ego...

856
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:17,160
that satisfies
your compulsion to kill.

857
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,250
No.

858
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:20,420
Every time you want
to take somebody out...

859
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,020
Death figure suddenly appears,
does the job for you.

860
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,470
It's your rational mind's way
of absolving yourself
of guilt.

861
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,760
No!

862
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,540
When did you first
start seeing spirits, Frank?
After Debra's death?

863
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,800
You killed your wife.

864
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,970
No!

865
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,270
I have studied
the coroner's reports...

866
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:43,120
of every death in Fairwater
since 1985.

867
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,320
Twenty-eight cases
involved crushed hearts.

868
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:50,120
Arteries choked
until they burst.

869
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:53,300
That started in 1990
with your...

870
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,600
beautiful wife, Debra.

871
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,460
She was the first.

872
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:03,470
Ray Lynskey.

873
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:06,370
You have an argument with him,
three hours later, dead.

874
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,940
Magda Rees-Jones,
we know you didn't like her.

875
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,880
But what about the guy
in the toilet?

876
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,250
What did he do to you, Frank?

877
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,660
Piss on your Hush Puppies?

878
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:24,080
Why are you shaking?

879
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,960
Oh, my.

880
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,930
My, my, my. You're doing it
right now, aren't you?

881
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:37,600
You're trying to kill me.
Right now.

882
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,100
Forget it, Bannister.

883
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,440
I'm wearing
a lead breastplate!

884
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:49,450
We have 28
unexplained deaths here.

885
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,480
You know what I think?

886
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,890
I think you are involved
in each and every one of them.

887
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,230
Buddy, this way.

888
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,690
No.

889
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:12,440
Man! Pulling your drawers off?
Man, what the hell?

890
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,970
Benny?

891
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,440
My man, Benny.
Stu, it's my boy here,
Benny, man.

892
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,610
Benny, but I'm your friend,
man, seriously.

893
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,580
Three words, shower with soap.

894
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:22,880
Come on.

895
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,950
You all right?
Spasm.

896
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,320
It's all right.

897
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,990
Frank!
Frank, we got problems.

898
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,330
These guys are gonna
stitch you up
on a capital offence.

899
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,420
All these murders
that have been going on
in Fairwater...

900
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,760
they're gonna
pin them on you.

901
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:39,500
Stu and I are gonna get you
out of here.
So come on, man, let's go.

902
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:40,930
Frank?

903
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,510
Frank, come out of it, man.
Wait, no, wait.

904
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,400
Oh, God! Forget it, Stu.

905
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,410
Look at him.

906
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,120
He doesn't believe anymore.

907
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,730
It won't be long now.

908
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,890
He's reached
the acceptance stage.

909
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,160
Grappling with his guilt.

910
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:12,500
Seeking resolution.

911
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,630
You realize,
Agent Dammers...

912
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,610
we have no forensic evidence
linking him with
any of the deaths.

913
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,940
Doesn't matter.

914
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:25,710
I expect this case
to suicide long before
it ever reaches trial.

915
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,520
They always do.

916
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,430
So much for the dream home.

917
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:25,910
What the hell
are we doing here, Lucy?

918
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,670
I mean, look at this place.
It's a dump.

919
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:31,570
God, this guy's a loser.

920
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,250
Oh, my God, Lucy.

921
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:37,650
Look at this. Look at this.

922
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,390
He set us up, Lucy.
The man set us up.

923
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:43,220
This is our house!

924
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,760
He took us
for a couple
of schmucks, Lucy.

925
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:48,490
Look, Lucy. Look.

926
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,930
Perfectly good
basketball court gone to pot.

927
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,830
Yeah, Bannister.

928
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,340
Mr. Bannister,
you've got to help me.

929
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:35,440
My daughter,
Patricia Ann Bradley, is
communing with the evil one.

930
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,480
He's in this house
at her instigation.

931
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,520
Help me.
Help me drive them out.

932
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,540
Lucy, I gotta know
why you keep shutting me out.

933
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,100
I still have a lot to...

934
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,710
Lucy!

935
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,090
Patricia.

936
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:32,200
Dr. Lynskey.

937
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,170
Patricia, are you all right?

938
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,710
It's your mother, isn't it?

939
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:53,350
Your mother's the one
who's been hurting you.

940
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:01,690
She needs help.
She's delusional, Patricia.

941
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,830
You can't go on like this.

942
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,360
You don't understand.

943
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,940
No!

944
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:24,450
My father killed himself
after the murders.

945
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,220
Mother says it was my fault.

946
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:32,390
So I have to keep his ashes
in my room.

947
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,800
Oh, my God.

948
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:49,910
She says I'm evil...

949
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,110
just like Johnny.

950
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:03,850
Come with me
to Mother's room.

951
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,700
This isn't you.

952
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,900
This isn't who you are now.

953
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,510
It was Johnny.

954
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,890
He went crazy.

955
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:39,250
I couldn't get away from him.
I thought
he was gonna kill me.

956
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,100
Patricia, you have to get out
of this house.

957
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,720
You can start over.

958
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,770
It's Mother.
Please hide. Please.

959
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:59,010
I'll take her
to the kitchen.

960
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,870
You sneak out later.

961
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:10,260
What are you doing
in my room?

962
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,260
I thought I heard a noise.

963
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,760
I'll make you
some coffee, Mother.

964
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:10,280
Mother, coffee's ready.

965
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:27,440
Lucy, go.

966
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:01,830
Frank.

967
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,200
Thank you, Deputy.

968
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:09,410
Just call me
when you're done,
Dr. Lynskey.

969
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,610
Yes.

970
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:16,750
Frank. Frank, listen to me.
I found your knife.

971
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,910
It was hidden
in old lady Bradley's closet.

972
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,490
She's crazy, Frank.

973
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,290
You haven't hurt anybody.

974
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,730
You're a good person, Frank.

975
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:34,600
Don't do this.

976
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,330
Please don't do this.

977
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,410
Jesus, do you think
that you're the only person...

978
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,210
who's ever lost somebody?

979
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:51,210
God, you walk around like
you don't have any feelings...

980
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:53,690
but the truth is
that you're just scared.

981
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,990
You're a goddamn hypocrite.
Why are you doing this?

982
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,990
What are you afraid of, Frank?

983
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:11,410
I don't want
to hurt you, Lucy.

984
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,530
That's crap.
Don't give me that.

985
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,580
Look at me.

986
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:58,880
No. I'll be outside.
This shit is like
walking in on your parents.

987
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:06,290
Right. Right. Yeah,
I'll just be outside.
I'll just...

988
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,040
What is it, Frank?
Look out!

989
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,470
You son of a bitch.

990
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,280
What's happening?

991
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,390
Grab him!

992
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,520
What's happening?

993
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,630
Okay. Listen. Listen to me.

994
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:46,230
Call for the deputy
and try to sound calm.

995
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,170
Deputy, I'm ready
to leave now.

996
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:02,380
Stuart, where did he go?
I think we got him.

997
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,460
Shit.

998
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:17,360
No, you son of a bitch!
Get out, Frank! Go!

999
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:20,630
Frank!

1000
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:25,100
This way. Go.

1001
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,710
Freeze, Bannister!
All right.

1002
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,220
Help.
I got you now.

1003
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:39,510
Please help me.
He's gone crazy.
All right.

1004
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:41,860
Stay back.

1005
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:44,020
Now...

1006
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,390
Frank, come on!

1007
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,830
Go, Frank! Get out of here!
Please! Now!

1008
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,630
Frank, let's go!

1009
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,410
No, this way. Come on.

1010
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,590
Shit!

1011
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,660
What was that
in that cell, Frank? I felt
something crushing my heart.

1012
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,730
I can't fight him, Luce.
I can't protect you.

1013
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,970
There's only one way
to deal with this thing.

1014
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,710
I got to have
an out-of-body experience.

1015
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:40,080
What?
And I got to have it
right now.

1016
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:41,780
No!

1017
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:44,820
Go away, Luce.
Just walk the other way.

1018
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,550
Wait. Wait.

1019
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:56,520
This will slow
your heart rate and lower
your body temperature.

1020
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,740
You'll have 20 minutes, max.

1021
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:10,110
Any longer than that
and there's a danger
of tissue damage.

1022
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,580
That's only if I can
successfully revive you...

1023
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:14,550
and there's no guarantee.

1024
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,580
Frank...

1025
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:20,360
you don't have to do this.

1026
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:22,820
Lucy, better close the door.

1027
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:24,420
Hurry up.

1028
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,860
It won't take long.

1029
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:49,630
I didn't know
you had an interest
in cryogenics, Dr. Lynskey.

1030
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:53,270
I'm reviving him at 9:00.
Why would we want to do that?

1031
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,350
Luce.

1032
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,460
Lucy.

1033
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:43,560
Whoa.

1034
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,040
There we go.

1035
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,990
Let me go, you bastard.
Let me go!

1036
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:16,090
Let me out now, you bastard!
Let me out of this car now!

1037
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:42,050
I find cemeteries very...

1038
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:46,010
restful places, don't you?

1039
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:49,250
Turn this car around
and take me back.

1040
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:51,450
I intend to, Mrs. Lynskey.

1041
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:56,700
In exactly 11 hours time.

1042
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:58,500
Son of a bitch!

1043
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,070
No.

1044
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:10,850
I knew Charlie.

1045
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:13,910
Spahn Ranch, 1969.

1046
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:15,980
My first assignment.

1047
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:21,920
I was the Family's
sex slave...

1048
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:25,620
for six months. Six months...

1049
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,060
in the service
of my country...

1050
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:32,400
disguised as a filthy hippie.

1051
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:43,540
I want out!

1052
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:52,320
Let me out of here!
Come back here, you creep!

1053
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:15,240
My body is a road map of pain.

1054
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,350
1974...

1055
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:23,680
Children of Lucifer.

1056
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:28,650
Three years undercover...

1057
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:31,120
drinking goat's blood.

1058
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,830
1981...

1059
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:37,500
I infiltrated
The Cult of the Dead.

1060
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,930
I was involved in
ritualistic cannibalism...

1061
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:47,440
in orgiastic dances
reaching...

1062
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,270
painful thresholds
of intense physical eroticism.

1063
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:57,090
I have withstood
excruciating pain.

1064
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:03,460
But I will not be broken.

1065
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,600
I have suffered
for my country...

1066
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:16,860
Lucy.

1067
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,840
But pain...

1068
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:23,180
has its reward.

1069
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:30,640
The power of the mind...

1070
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,350
is absolute.

1071
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:50,370
Frank.

1072
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:53,230
Frank, is that you?

1073
01:28:57,250 --> 01:29:01,310
I'm doing this?

1074
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,950
I'm making the car move
with the power of my mind?

1075
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,550
Yes!

1076
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,550
No.

1077
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:09,950
Wait!

1078
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,590
Get back
in the goddamn ground...

1079
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:20,260
you unorganized
grab-asstic gob
of teleplasmic shit!

1080
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,580
Who in the hell are you?
Sound off
like you've got a pair!

1081
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,690
Hey, asshole.

1082
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:49,920
Who are you?

1083
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:57,020
Who are you?

1084
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,030
Johnny Bartlett.

1085
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,340
I thought guys like you
fried in hell.

1086
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:12,040
I got out, Frank.

1087
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:18,220
I've been carrying
on the good work.
Got me a score of 40.

1088
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:33,160
Harry Sinclair.

1089
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:37,600
I just want to shake
the hand of the man
who finally avenged my death.

1090
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,430
You've got a number.

1091
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:44,780
Bartlett carved it
into my forehead
as I lay dying.

1092
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:47,480
I was the last.

1093
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:51,180
He couldn't be more wrong,
could he, Frank?

1094
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,990
Shit!

1095
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,160
No. No!

1096
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:37,290
No! Don't use it.

1097
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,090
No.

1098
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:50,470
Frank. Okay. Just breathe.

1099
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:52,610
Breathe slowly. Breathe.

1100
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,480
Okay. You're okay.

1101
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:55,950
Okay. Frank.

1102
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,410
All right, Lucy, come on.

1103
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:03,790
A hundred milligrams
of lidocaine.

1104
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:06,450
Get me one cc of adrenaline,
quick, now.

1105
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,990
I didn't get him.
Who?

1106
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,730
Who didn't you get, Frank?

1107
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:15,740
Johnny Bartlett.

1108
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:18,170
He's back.

1109
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,410
He's hallucinating.
It'll pass.
Lucy...

1110
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,840
he's killing again.

1111
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,540
Patricia.

1112
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:31,520
Lucy, you got to
get her out of the house.

1113
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,150
Go!

1114
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:52,530
Patricia! Patricia.

1115
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:57,770
Listen to me.
We have to get out of here.

1116
01:33:58,310 --> 01:34:00,310
Patricia never
leaves the house.

1117
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,440
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bradley,
but she's coming with me.

1118
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:05,450
You have no right.
She's my daughter.
Get upstairs.

1119
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,180
No. Look,
this is gonna stop now.

1120
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,720
What are you talking about?

1121
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:12,820
Why do you have
Frank Bannister's knife
in your closet?

1122
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,950
You went in my room?

1123
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:17,220
Mother.

1124
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:18,630
Patricia.

1125
01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:57,660
Mother wants to go
to the police now.

1126
01:34:58,140 --> 01:34:59,470
No...

1127
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,710
she'll be down
in a few minutes.

1128
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,940
No, Patricia,
we have to go now.

1129
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:07,380
It's just not safe here.
Johnny Bartlett's back.

1130
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,810
I know.

1131
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:15,950
He visits me at night.

1132
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,020
I don't know why he comes.

1133
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:23,160
He torments me.

1134
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:26,390
Why has he come?

1135
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,230
Am I being punished?

1136
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:33,330
Patricia, please.
Let's just go now, please.

1137
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:35,270
I wanna kill her now, Patty.

1138
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,480
That'll give us 41.

1139
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,810
That's eight clear of Gacy.

1140
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:45,750
Another nine and we'll
have broken Bundy's record.

1141
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:49,120
I can't wait
to see old Ted's face
when he hears the news.

1142
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,420
Yes!

1143
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:51,850
What?

1144
01:35:53,730 --> 01:35:55,200
I'm sorry.

1145
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:59,130
We really should wait
for Mother.

1146
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:04,630
And that asswipe psychic
nearly ruined it
for us tonight, Patty.

1147
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:09,640
He made us look stupid.
You're gonna
be okay, Patricia.

1148
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:12,310
Everything's going to be
all right.
Shut up.

1149
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:14,310
That Russian cannibal creep's
running around...

1150
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:15,980
saying he did 50 plus.

1151
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,150
That reflects badly
on the both of us, Patty.

1152
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:25,060
This record should be held
by an American.

1153
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:26,620
I quite agree.

1154
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:29,730
You can come...

1155
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:34,530
stay with me if you like.

1156
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,470
I'm going
to kill her now, baby.

1157
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,940
I'd like that.

1158
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,210
I'll just get my coat.

1159
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:55,820
Patronizing do-gooder bitch!

1160
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,030
Patricia...

1161
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:04,230
you kill her, I'll watch.

1162
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:12,000
Ready?

1163
01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:29,690
I love it
when you do that, baby.

1164
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,030
Mrs. Bradley?

1165
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,870
Mrs. Bradley,
are you coming with us?

1166
01:37:50,410 --> 01:37:52,310
Oh, my God.

1167
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:28,940
Lucy!

1168
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,930
No, not that way!

1169
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:17,890
Jesus, Lucy.

1170
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,400
Oh, my God. These are
Johnny Bartlett's ashes.

1171
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:26,570
What?

1172
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,510
We gotta get these
to the other side.

1173
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:29,600
What?

1174
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,240
A church.
We got to get them
to a church.

1175
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:35,780
There's a chapel.
There's a chapel
in the old hospital.

1176
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:37,450
All right.

1177
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,550
No!

1178
01:39:59,110 --> 01:40:01,540
No, let's go down here.
Okay.

1179
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:09,680
Damn it.

1180
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,590
Look there. You see that door?
Yes.

1181
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:52,850
It's all right.
Come out when I say.

1182
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,500
I'm gonna look up there.
Okay.

1183
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:18,750
Lucy?

1184
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:27,850
This is great.

1185
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:32,260
Frank?

1186
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:37,500
Excuse me, Doctor,
we're looking for Ward 12.

1187
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:40,670
Go up the stairs
to the fourth floor...

1188
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:42,270
down the corridor
to your right.

1189
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:44,840
It's just opposite the chapel.
Thank you.

1190
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:47,380
I'll get someone
to help. Orderly.

1191
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,750
Orderly, are you deaf?

1192
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:53,220
I said,
Orderly, are you deaf?

1193
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,120
Moron!

1194
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:09,270
I guess that makes you
number one.

1195
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,800
Get down!

1196
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:16,470
Frank, are you okay?

1197
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,370
The chapel's
on the fourth floor.

1198
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:56,610
No, Frank, watch out!

1199
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,530
We gotta go. Go!

1200
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:47,490
Lucy.

1201
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:50,560
Lucy.

1202
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,850
You're all the same.

1203
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,670
Wait!

1204
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:29,970
No! Lucy!

1205
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:33,510
Put the gun down, son.
The law is on its way.

1206
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,640
What's the score, Patty?

1207
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:42,240
Eleven.

1208
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:44,910
That's the same
as Starkweather's.

1209
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:50,350
We have a tie on our hands.

1210
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,190
Lucy.
Frank.

1211
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:32,930
It's jammed.

1212
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,060
Take it. Just take it.
Right.

1213
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,610
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

1214
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:43,800
No.

1215
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,900
Give that to me.
Let me guess.

1216
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:15,970
You have to get these ashes
to consecrated ground...

1217
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:19,100
in order to destroy
the forces of evil.

1218
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:21,240
Give me
the goddamn urn, Dammers!

1219
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:25,750
Under no circumstances must
these ashes ever be released.

1220
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,150
No!

1221
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:31,680
Oops.

1222
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:36,430
You have no idea
what you've just done.

1223
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:41,430
You just don't get it,
do you, Frank?

1224
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:47,870
Your pathological mindset
has made it necessary...

1225
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:51,380
for you to interpret your
sad personal inadequacies...

1226
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:53,470
as a grand struggle
between good and evil...

1227
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:57,310
in order
to gratify your pathetic need
for self-glorification.

1228
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:04,830
You are such an asshole.

1229
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:09,900
Yes, I am. I'm an asshole...

1230
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:12,290
With an Uzi.

1231
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:15,100
Get up!

1232
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,370
You make me sick! Get up!

1233
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:20,170
Turn around. I don't want
to shoot you in the back.

1234
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,570
Turn around!
I said, turn around!

1235
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:25,850
As an agent
of the United States
Government...

1236
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:28,180
I am ordering you
to turn around.

1237
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,600
Frank!

1238
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:09,150
Please,
please don't hurt me. Stop.

1239
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,240
Please.

1240
01:49:44,230 --> 01:49:45,390
Frank!

1241
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,890
Oh, my God. Frank.

1242
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:05,440
Debra.

1243
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:27,730
You killed her.

1244
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:33,340
You're next, pal.

1245
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:38,300
Take him out, baby.

1246
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,750
No! Get him!

1247
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:53,920
No! Stop!

1248
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:58,430
Frank!

1249
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:02,900
No!

1250
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,200
Get him, Patty.

1251
01:51:10,850 --> 01:51:11,940
Yeah, baby.

1252
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,870
Baby, you are an artist.

1253
01:51:37,770 --> 01:51:39,570
You're pretty, too.
No!

1254
01:51:45,310 --> 01:51:46,340
No.

1255
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:52,580
Yes.

1256
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:05,290
I'm in the mood
for a little vivisection.

1257
01:52:05,370 --> 01:52:06,390
No!

1258
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:08,400
Me, too.

1259
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:16,510
You bitch!

1260
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,480
No!

1261
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:25,280
I got your girlfriend, Johnny!

1262
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,410
Come and get her!
No, goddamn you!
Let go of her!

1263
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:31,120
Johnny!
Come and get her,
you coward!

1264
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:33,390
Come on and get her!
No!

1265
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,730
Let go of my Patty!

1266
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:40,290
Patty!

1267
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:48,210
Johnny!

1268
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:03,590
Come here.
Give me your hand.

1269
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:08,830
Whoa.

1270
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:13,900
See you later, Frank.
We got you.

1271
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:17,900
We're going back down
to get us some more!

1272
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:19,840
Yo, Frank.

1273
01:53:22,710 --> 01:53:24,080
How's it going?

1274
01:53:27,250 --> 01:53:28,370
Bye, Frank.

1275
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:34,520
Johnny. Johnny.

1276
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:36,080
Step back, Frank.
Yeah.

1277
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:38,180
This isn't
going to be pleasant.

1278
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:13,950
The old express bus to hell.
No lines, no waiting.

1279
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:26,860
It's really something,
isn't it?

1280
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:28,770
Excellent libraries.

1281
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:30,730
Premium cigars.

1282
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:34,540
And of course,
the honeys.

1283
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:38,540
Yeah, how about that?
Stu's a regular
chick magnet up here.

1284
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:45,990
Hello, Frank.

1285
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:50,430
It's time to go home.

1286
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:52,890
I am home.

1287
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,360
No.

1288
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:58,440
You see, the authorities
have informed us...

1289
01:54:58,510 --> 01:55:00,740
that it's just not your time.

1290
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:03,930
Start living, dude.

1291
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:11,650
Be happy.

1292
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:29,630
Frank!

1293
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,470
There's something
I have to tell you.

1294
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:11,670
Yeah?

1295
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:22,780
Sorry to interrupt you, folks.
It's all right, Walt.

1296
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:28,990
Frank, what do you know
about Ouija boards?

1297
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:30,190
Not a lot.

1298
01:56:30,370 --> 01:56:32,990
I found a whole stack of them
up at the Bradley house.

1299
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:35,900
It looks like Patricia just
got herself a direct line...

1300
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:39,030
to her dead boyfriend
as soon as she was released
five years ago.

1301
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:40,730
It seems like the old lady...

1302
01:56:40,810 --> 01:56:43,440
when she got wind
of Patricia's involvement...

1303
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:49,250
in your wife's death, then she
just kept the girl sedated.

1304
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:51,920
She just couldn't stop
Bartlett, though.

1305
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:54,720
Nice epilogue, Walt.
It was well delivered.

1306
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:57,280
Frank.

1307
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:01,150
Just one other little thing.

1308
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:04,600
I got a whole bucket load
of vacation time
coming to me...

1309
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:06,790
and I thought you and I...

1310
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:09,560
could collaborate on a book
about all this.

1311
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:11,500
It could be my ticket
off the force.

1312
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:12,870
That's not really my area.

1313
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:14,370
If you're looking
for a collaborator...

1314
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:16,840
how about your guardian angel
over there?

1315
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:27,380
You got me, Frank.
I got you, Walt.

1316
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:33,950
I'll see you, Frank. Bye-bye.

1317
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:40,900
Boy, that Dammers,
he sure looks pissed.

1318
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:42,030
Yeah.

1319
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:46,360
Well, sometimes, Frank,
you see...

1320
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,470
when you go through
a traumatic experience...

1321
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:50,670
it kind of
alters your perception.

1322
01:57:53,050 --> 01:57:54,210
No.

1323
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:00,280
Whoa!
