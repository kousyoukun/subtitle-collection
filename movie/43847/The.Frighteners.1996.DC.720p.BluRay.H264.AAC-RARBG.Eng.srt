Please don't hurt me.

It's wrong!
She's too young!

4

Really such a shame.

00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,111
Go.

Oh, damn.

34
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,713
Oh, no!

Oh, my god, I don't believe this.
This is not happening.

Whoa!

39
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,986
Hey. How you doing?

40
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,240
Just give me a call.
I'll pay for the damages.

41
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,575
You're damn right
you're gonna pay

42
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:48,701
'cause I'm gonna
sue your ass.

43
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,286
Now let's not get
litigious, all right?

44
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,745
Just send me a bill.

45
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,998
"Frank bannister,
psychic investigator"?

46
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,541
That's right.
Well, that's a good one.

47
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,335
How come you didn't see the oorner coming?
You stupid moron.

48
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,462
This is goddamn bullshit!

49
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:03,048
Listen, buddy, this is
gonna cost you big time.

50
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,967
You're paying for a new
fence, you hear me?

51
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,761
I want this lawn
completely resurfaced.

52
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,221

This is private property.

56

Oh! Mrs. Bradley?
I'm Dr. lynskey.

57
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,301
I work at the
medical center.

58
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,970
No, you don't.
I know who works there.

59
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:52,056
I started there
three months ago.

60
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,433
Dr. kamins is
my personal physician.

61
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,727
Yes, well, Dr. kamins
is attending a funeral

62
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,937
and I'm seeing
his patients today.

63
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,319
She was cutting the vegetables
and the knife slipped.

64
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,988
Well, a couple of stitches
and she'll be fine.

65
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,948
I'll drive you
to the clinic.

66
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,659
That's impossible.

67
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,495
It's a deep cut.

68
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,871
Then leave her
some antibiotics.

69
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,331
Mother, please.

70
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,749
Patricia never
leaves the house.

71
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,920
But it hurts.

72
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,713
To your room,
this instant!

73
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,761
Wait, just a minute.

74
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,100
Who did that to you?

75
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,605
I think you'd better
go now, Dr. lynskey.

76
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,446
You don't know who my
daughter is, do you?

77
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,533
Patricia's not
to be trusted.

78
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,617
I beg your pardon?

79
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,537
I can have her locked up
anytime I want to.

80
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,586
They said she was an
accessory after the fact.

81
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,047
I know the truth.

82
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,760
It was cold-blooded murder.

99

109

That's her.

110
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,016
I was in her house
this afternoon.

111
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,063
Well, that's just
terrific, honey.

112
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,564

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,279
She was 15 years old,
you know.

128
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,656
She just fell in love
with the wrong guy.

129
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,032
It could happen to anyone.

130
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,451
Sweetie, I don't want you
going back up there.

131
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,579

me the creeps.

132
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,123
I really don't think
that you should...

133
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,627
Come on, honey.

134
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,092
I think tiger's getting
a little lonely.

135
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,761
Guess what I did tonight,
honey.

136
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,390
I made reservations
at Excalibur's.

137
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,312
Don't you remember,
sweetheart?

138
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,981
It's our anniversary
this Tuesday.

139
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,858
I even got our
favorite table.

140
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,527
Yeah? You silly Willy?

141
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,003
What the hell
is this doing here?

142
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,382
I thought I tore this up.

143
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,593
Did he come back to the house?
Vvho?

144
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,219

tore up my fence!

147
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,192
He's alive.

148
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,276
Ray!

149
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,695
Ray, get me off!

150
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,759
You sick thing!

151
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,027
Lucy, I don't want
that con man in my house.

152
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,117
There's gotta be some kind of
rational explanation for all this.

153
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,662
I just don't want some goddamn spoon
bender telling me what to do.

154
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,958
Ray, we have
got a poltergeist!

155
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,961
Well, it's nothing that
the police can't handle.

156
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,635
Bannister.

157
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,889
Dr. lynskey,
I'm on my way.

158
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,568
Ah! Persistent residue
of the departed.

159
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,902
Always a problem
this time of year.

160
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,070
Dr. lynskey?

161
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,488
Ah, yes.
Thank you for coming.

162
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,573
Yeah.

163
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,993
The activity is currently
located where?

164
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,663
Well, I don't know. It just went
quiet about five minutes ago.

165
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,374
Went quiet?

166
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,128
The dining room table spun in
a counterclockwise direction?

167
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,256
I don't think that
that one happened. No.

168
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,135
The toilet seat lid
banged up and down?

169
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,303
No.

170
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,846
Did the bed levitate?

171
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,140
Yeah, with me on it.

172
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,394
Spontaneous recurrent
psychokinesis. Oh, boy.

173
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,064
This could be the worst
case I've ever seen.

174
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,025
Yeah, this is bad.

175
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,109
Mmm-hmm.

176
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,779
Okay. Well, folks,
i can do a clearance

177
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,156
but it's not
gonna be cheap.

178
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,408
Although I do offer
a six-month guarantee.

179
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,659
How much?

180
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,496
$249.95.

181
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,956
But there is
a 30% surcharge

182
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,792
for making a house call
after midnight.

183
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,752
Then there's vehicle, gas,

184
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,921
so I'd say the whole thing
is gonna set you back

185
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,049
somewhere in
the neighborhood of $450.

186
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,678
Although we could
forget about the fence,

187
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,888
call the whole thing even.

188
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,474
Do it.

189
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,313
Okay. Excuse me, ma'am.
You wanna stand back.

190
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,607
I don't want you
to have to sign a waiver.

191
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,235
Plus a $100 for materials.
I can't be out of pocket.

192
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,029
Justdoit for Christ's
sakes, bannister.

193
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,532
Here we go.

194
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,369
All righty.

195
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,706
Why us? I mean, why are
they in our house?

196
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,500
All I can tell you
is emanations are

197
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,126
normally confined
to the cemetery

198
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,545
although they do escape.

199
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,255
It's usually the young ones.

200
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,215
For god's sakes,
bannister, come on.

201
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,635
Come on.

202
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,560
It's holy water.

203
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,075
This is bullshit.
This is total bullshit.

204
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,454
Come on. Yes!

205
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,085
Okay, these belong to you.

206
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,629
Six ectoplasmic emanations.

207
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,299
Don't worry.
They can't escape.

208
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,010
Some people like a souvenir. Where
would you like me to put them?

209
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,888
No. I really don't think
we wanna hang onto those.

210
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,306
So, thank you.

211
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,432
Do we, hon?

212
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,309
I could give a rat's ass.

213
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,060
Okay.

214
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,693
Don't worry,
they can't feel a thing.

215
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,445
At least that's what
it says in the book.

216
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,865
You never really
know for sure.

217
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,534
All right.
Thank you, bannister.

218
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,744
You can go.

219
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,124
What the hell
are you staring at?

220
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,170
What's with the number?

221
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,130
What number?

222
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,761
Look, if you're trying to freak
me out, it's not gonna work, okay?

223
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:33,970
You know what
he's trying to do?

224
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,806
He's trying to get more money out
of us is what he's trying to do.

225
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,935
Here, take your shit and get
the hell out of my house.

226
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,186
Come on.

227
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:42,896
Move.

228
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,522
Ray, just...

229
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,525
Thank you so much.

230
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,075
There you go.
Thanks.

231
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,493
Thank you.

232
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,413
Why do you always
have to alienate everybody?

233
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,191
I think
I'm going to throw up.

234
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,568
Damn.

235
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,592
Man, I hate that trunk!

236
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,178
Yeah, I don't want you guys
spreading your ectoplasmic: Muck

237
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,430
all over my car seats.

238
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,472
Ain't that a bitch.

239
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,809
The eotoplasm's the only thing sticky
enough to hold the damn oar together.

240
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,104
Look, frank, I'm sorry about your
pus yellow, pieoe-of-shit Volvo

241
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,274
but we ain't riding in the damn
trunk no more, you understand?

242
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,485
We would like to cruise
with some style, man.

243
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,654
You know, you guys left
me high and dry tonight.

244
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,073
I get to the house,
nothing's happening.

245
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,742
I couldn't believe it.

246
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,287
Stuart, in or out?

247
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,124
You guys didn't even
bang the toilet seat lid?

248
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,667
You made me
look like an asshole.

249
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,879
We strained our backs lifting
that heavy ass bed, frank.

250
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,922
Yeah. Who was the idiot

251
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,216
who put the number
in the guy's forehead?

252
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,970
It wasn't funny.

253
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,347
Start pulling
your weight, guys

254
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,974
or you're going back to the cemetery.

255
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,310
Yeah, well,
you can pull this, frank.

256
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,812
I'm about to go
like Jesse on your ass.

257
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,608
I'm gonna find me some other blaok
ghosts and then organize a march.

258
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,196
The African American apparition
coalition. The aaac.

259
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,864
And I'm gonna tell you
something, frank!

260
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:02,368
There ain't nothing worse than a bunch of
pissed off brothers that's already dead!

261
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,704
Will someone
help me, please?

262
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,584
Stu, man, you gotta loosen up, man.
I'm serious.

263
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:14,214
Come on. Looser, just loosen up, okay?
You lose? All right.

264
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,718
You're so tight you can play "pick
up sticks" with your butt cheeks.

265
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,808
Loosen up. There you go.

266
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,435
Damn!

267
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:32,273
That fellow takes us
totally for granted.

268
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,986
And we're supposed to be
his business partners.

269
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,488
What a joke!

270
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,990
I'm gonna straighten him out.
First thing in the morning.

271
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,326
He's dealing with
a double major here.

272
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,495
Well, no more Mr. nice guy.

273
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,330
I'm gonna get rough!

274
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,624
You talking to me, Stuart?
No.

275
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,794
See, Stuart, that's your problem.
You're too soft with him.

276
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,337
You gotta just
walk up to frank,

277
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:55,880
just look him in
the eye and just say,

278
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:59,300
frank, give me what I want
or I'm gonna bust your ass!

279
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,365
Yo, frank!
How's it hanging?

280
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,034
I don't know, Cyrus.
You tell me.

281
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,619
Well, frank,
I'll tell you.

282
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,163
The women ain't
missing nothing!

283
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,789
Hey, come on.
I told you guys,

284
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,833
get the hell
out of my plumbing.

285
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,544
Hey, look, come on, frank!

286
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,380
Look, we want to call
a meeting, man. We gotta...

287
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,049
Hey, Cyrus.
I gotta take a leak.

288
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,302
And I'm not getting
out of the shower.

289
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,720
Goodbye.

290
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:48,641
Therefore, a happy ghost
is a productive ghost.

291
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,563
To that end, I've drawn
up a list of suggestions.

292
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,981
Now bear in mind, frank

293
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,984
that we have given you
five years of loyal service.

294
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,823
Flies. That's what you've
given me, Stuart. Flies.

295
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,659
Why is it that flies stick to you
guys like shit to a blanket?

296
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,287
Ha-ha! Very funny.
You a funny guy, frank.

297
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,164
You know, all you
think about is yourself.

298
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,707
You know, I can complain,
too, you know.

299
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,043
I would like some new clothes.
You get to dress nicely.

300
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,253
I am still looking like
Linc from the mod squad.

301
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,672
You died in the '70s.
It's a bummer.

302
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,258
I think what Cyrus is
attempting to say, frank,

303
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,886
is that we don't feel that
the enterprise is evolving

304
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,223
in quite the manner
in which we all agree.

305
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:34,604
Please don't reach through me
when I'm trying to speak to you.

306
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,658
Now, frank,
we gotta talk about cigars.

307
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,867
Cigars?
Damn right.

308
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,036
You've been promising a box
for I don't know how long.

309
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,455
Cyrus, I hate to break this to
you but you're dead, you know.

310
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,665
You can't smoke.

311
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,542
Well, you can light them up
and blow the smoke in my face.

312
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,712
If I light up a cigar, I'll
blow my lunch in your face.

313
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,133
Everybody, get down!
Goddamn it, judge!

314
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,933
Put the shooters away.

315
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:15,687
Whoa!

316
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,402
That was a head shot, frank.
He could have killed me.

317
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,654
You know, if I wanted
to get shot at every day

318
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,156
I'd move my black
ass to Los Angeles!

319
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,676
When a man's
jawbone drops off

320
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:50,513
it's time to
reassess the situation.

321
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,395
I got myself
a nice little grave

322
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,772
up there at the cemetery.

323
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,944
It could soon be time
to lay my bones.

324
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,863
No, you're my go-to 911v-

325
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,698
without you,
I'm out of business, judge.

326
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,825
Frightening,

327
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,162
that's a young
man's game, frank.

328
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,957
I ain't got no more
hauntings left in me.

329
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:22,003
What are you talking about?
You're in great shape.

330
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,380
My joints are
getting powdery.

331
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,050
The dog's running
away with my face.

332
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,677
Hell, I'm falling apart.

333
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,096
You've been
falling apart for years.

334
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,436
Don't go saying nothing
to the boys

335
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,648
but my ectoplasm is
all dried up.

336
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,194
I'm sorry to
hear that, judge.

337
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,781
Give it up, frank.

338
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,241
Death ain't no way
to make a living.

339
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,243
Yeah, well, judge, i
gotta finish this house.

340
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,912
You ain't never
gonna finish this house.

341
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,373
You ain't never
gonna finish nothing!

342
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,458
You're fooling yourself,
frank!

343
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:09,092
Too many skeletons
in the closet.

344
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,271
It's us, frank.

345
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,150
What do you think?
Pretty scary, huh?

346
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,027
Don't you ever do that again.

347
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:35,201
Maybe we should try
a white sheet next time.

348
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,205
Ain't gonna be no
white sheets, bro.

349
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,289
Oh?
Huh?

350
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,002
Morning, Zach.

351
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,046
Frank.

352
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,054
Okay. You guys wanna talk,
let's talk.

353
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,681
Let's talk about this.

354
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,182
This is a letter
from my bank.

355
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,644
This says they want $15,000 from
me or they're gonna sell my house.

356
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,730
Well, cool! About time we
ditched this drafty ass crib

357
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,608
and moved to some place nice
with some glass in the windows.

358
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,485
Hey, Cyrus, this is
serious shit, okay?

359
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,487
This is my house.
I'm not losing it!

360
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:13,948
Stuart.

361
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,742
The chicken, the chicken
was not scary, Stuart.

362
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,202
The chicken was stupid.

363
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,373
Judge, help me
out here, okay?

364
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:26,252
Talk to these guys. They look
up to you, all right'? Thanks.

365
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:30,006
I need $15,000, guys.
I need it quick.

366
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,342
It is time to
get seriously scary.

367
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,762
So you checked
the place out, right?

368
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,347
Right.

369
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,433
How many we got in here?

370
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,102
Five. They won't
suspect a thing.

371
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,312
Hmm.

372
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,772
Poor suckers. They won't even know
what him 'em. How many exits?

373
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,107
Two.

374
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,951
All right, man, this is it.
We gotta be hard. No mercy.

375
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,078
We're going in like professionals,
like Charles Bronson.

376
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,122
We don't stop till the
screaming starts, you dig?

377
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,707
I'm with you.

378
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,417
Let's go.

379
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,878
Yeah.

380
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,506
Let's kick some ass.

381
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:14,425
Here we go.
One, two, three...

382
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,304
Good morning, my darlings.
Hello.

383
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,097
The mail's on the table,
Mrs. waterhouse.

384
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,682
Thank you, Sylvia.

385
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:25,269
Sylvia, mother is coming
for lunch. Pick up, quick.

386
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,979
Yes, ma'am.

387
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,732
Big kiss.

388
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,777
All right, kid, quitjumping
around and acting like a baby.

389
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,487
This is serious.

390
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:38,574
Now, we're gonna scare the living
daylights out of your parents.

391
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,785
So, come on, kid,
you gonna help us out?

392
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,245
Are you with us?

393
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:46,082
See? He gets it.
The kids always get it.

394
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,833
Let's go.
All right.

395
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,260
Mrs. waterhouse.

396
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,056
Mrs. waterhouse!

397
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,142
Damn. Here, man.
This one did <i>le</i> poo-poo.

398
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,269
Get it away from me.

399
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,353
Man, they're so little.

400
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,813
Their doo-doo
smells like old shoes.

401
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,231
Mrs. waterhouse!

402
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,777
My babies!

403
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,121
Yeah, frank bannister.

404
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:26,956
Uh-huh!

405
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,750
I'm on my way.

406
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,378
Judge.
Need you riding shotgun.

407
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:33,921
Yes.

408
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,140
Damn it! Come on, come on. Let's go.
Come on. D for drive.

409
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:45,808
Look around you, frank.

410
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,893
Don't you realize
what's happening?

411
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,770
Yeah, every other
car's a freaking hearse.

412
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,689
Come on, I can't even
get across town.

413
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:55,651
This town is
in deep trouble.

414
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,321
Yeah. Too many funerals,
not enough traffic lights.

415
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,364
It's death, frank.

416
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,909
Death is amongst us.

417
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,164
Come on, let's go.
Time is money.

418
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,291
You haven't heard a
goddamn word I've said.

419
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,251
I thought you had
some character, son.

420
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,503
But right now
you're not showing me much.

421
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,172
All right, judge.

422
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,381
Watch this.

423
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,386
Look out!

424
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,856
What's the matter, judge?
You look a little pale.

425
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,287
Beautiful.
Beautiful, judge.

426
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,707
This is gonna be easy. Why don't
you just rest your bones?

427
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,000
I'll be right back.

428
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,754
Ma'am.

429
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,634
Persistent residue
of the departed.

430
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,969
It's always a problem
this time of year.

431
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,888
Frank bannister,
i believe you called.

432
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,224
Not a minute too soon.
Oh, boy.

433
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,893
Frank, shejust...
Shut up.

434
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,062
Frank, it's no use.
She...

435
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,689
This is bad.

436
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:18,067
Recurrent
spontaneous psychokinesis.

437
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,697
Yeah, this could be the
worst case I have ever...

438
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:24,949
...seen.

439
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,205
I apologize for calling you,
Mr. bannister.

440
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,415
Please leave.

441
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,503
What the hell are
you trying to do to me?

442
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,464
Preying on the bereaved is
about as low as you can go.

443
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:43,843
You're a parasite, Mr. bannister,
and people should be warned.

444
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,846
Yeah, well, I got a right to
offer my services to the public.

445
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,305
In case you hadn't noticed,

446
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,766
we are in the midst
of a major health crisis.

447
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,310
The last thing the people
of fairwater need is some

448
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:57,898
two-bit oharlatan promising to pass on
bogus messages from the other side.

449
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,109
Now, if you will excuse me.

450
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,156
I'm just trying
to make a living.

451
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,741
Living?

452
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,786
Not a word you'd know alotaboutlsit Mr.
bannister?

453
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,250
Easy.

454
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,090
Asshole.

455
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,591
Whoa!
You all right, buddy?

456
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,092
Man, you took quite a fall.

457
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,803
Bannister!
Yeah.

458
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,304
Listen, you gotta help.

459
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,182
They're gonna bury me, man.
You gotta help.

460
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,768
Bannister,
what is happening to me?

461
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,770
Well, ray,
you appear to be dead.

462
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,523
Don't say that. That's impossible.
I'm in the prime of my life.

463
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,526
I work out every single day.
My wife's a goddamn doctor!

464
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,819
Why didn't you
take the corridor?

465
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,111
What corridor?

466
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,781
The corridor of life. The
passageway to the other side.

467
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,158
Because I don't belong
on the other side!

468
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,118
Jesus Christ, I'm only 29.

469
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:35,704
Hey, hey, hey!

470
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:37,915
Look, ray,

471
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,000
just relax, all right?

472
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,418
You wanna tell
me what happened?

473
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,087
I was on the rowing machine

474
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,881
and then suddenly
i felt this viselike grip

475
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:48,843
just squeezing my heart and
i couldn't breathe, frank.

476
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,220
I just couldn't
breathe and...

477
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,641
I've got the shakes now.
I need some vitamin b.

478
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,227
Yeah, you can't
take vitamins anymore.

479
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:01,564
You don't eat, you don't drink,
you don't go to the bathroom.

480
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,023
All that shit's over with.

481
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,068
In about a year's time
you're gonna get a chance

482
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,444
to go through to
the other side again.

483
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,321
To become what's known
as a pure spirit.

484
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,573
But in the meantime,

485
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,241
you're what's known as
an earthbound emanation

486
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,660
which is a rotting cloud
of bioplasmic particles

487
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,912
dripping ectoplasm
from every orifice.

488
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,838
Relax, ray.

489
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,094
All right, bannister,

490
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,598
can you at least give me a ride
so I don't miss my funeral?

491
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,230
Okay, ray, listen up.

492
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:46,775
The c:Emetery's not a safe place.
All right'? So stay close.

493
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,737
Later, bannister. Lwanna hear
what they're saying about me.

494
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,626
Don't worry about them. They're
not gonna to hurt you.

495
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:08,422
What in the hell
is going on out here?

496
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,591
Get back in your graves!

497
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,092
Son of a...

498
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,636
Holy Jesus!

499
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,638
Frank bannister!

500
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,222
Go ahead.
I'll handle this.

501
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,728
What the hell are you
doing in my graveyard?

502
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,147
You have been
told to stay away!

503
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,191
Sound off like
you've got a pair!

504
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,692
Yeah, well,
it's a public place, hiles.

505
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,194
I do not like you!

506
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:33,614
You cannot bring your spooks
in here without my permission!

507
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,115
Disappear, scumbag!

508
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:49,380
I am not one of your shitty
little emanations, bannister.

509
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,757
You cannot push
spirits around.

510
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,136
You are scum! Using spooks to
put the frighteners on people!

511
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:58,597
That makes me
physically ill!

512
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,101
We got a lot of
lowlifes around here!

513
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:06,063
And I will provide an armed response
at the first sign of trouble!

514
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,023
They must be contained!

515
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,074
Catch you later, hiles.

516
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,910
My tour of duty
runs another 85 years!

517
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,870
There's a piece
of dirt up here

518
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,997
with your name
on it, bannister!

519
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,709
I'm waiting for you,
you little maggot!

520
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,879
There were times when people
have accused ray of being

521
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:35,426
less than generous,
but I'm sure, deep down

522
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:39,513
the man possessed a heart of
gold and a generous spirit.

523
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,183
It's true.

524
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:46,061
He wouldn't lie.
Not at a time like this.

525
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,986
Because god has chosen
to call our brother ray

526
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,071
from this life to himself

527
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,407
we commit his body
to the ground.

528
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,577
Earth to earth, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.

529
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,703
Jesus,
what a waste.

530
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,246
The lord bless him
and keep him.

531
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,748
It's a goddamn tragedy.

532
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,418
The lord lift up his countenance
upon him and give him peace.

533
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,837
Goodbye, ray.

534
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,180
Sweetheart, don't cry.

535
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,307
Oh, shit!

536
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,290
Frank!

537
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,377
I know you can hear me.

538
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,630
Get me out of
this hole, bannister.

539
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:56,507
Frank.

540
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,674
Get me out of
this hole, please.

541
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:58,759
Hi, frank.

542
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,053
Hey, Walt.

543
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,846
Kind of surprised
to see you.

544
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:04,515
Here on business,
i guess?

545
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:06,016
Not exactly.

546
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,268
Bannister, they're gonna
bury me alive in here.

547
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,814
I understand you and lynskey
had a little run-in

548
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,607
the night before he died.

549
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,568
As a matter of fact,
apart from his wife

550
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,738
I believe you were the last
person to see him alive.

551
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,991
It sounds like you're the one
who's here on business, wait.

552
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:27,663
No. The FBI is very concerned
about these deaths.

553
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,249
They look like
heart attacks

554
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,042
but when they slice
these people open

555
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,546
their arteries are just
clean as a whistle.

556
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,132
But there's been this tremendous
pressure on the heart

557
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,511
like the life has just been
crushed right out of it.

558
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,555
You got any theories, frank?

559
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,223
Bannister!

560
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,563
Mind if I pay my last respects
before they fill him in?

561
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,357
Oh! No. I'm sorry.

562
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,322
Bannister, please.

563
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,506
I need to cheer up.

564
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,174
Mr. bannister?

565
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,888
Mr. bannister,
did you want to see me?

566
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,932
Oh, my god, frank.
She can see me.

567
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:35,731
I thought perhaps you might
have a message from ray.

568
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,484
Tell her. Tell her I'm here, frank.
Tell her.

569
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,862
I mean, everyone says
that you're a fraud

570
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,572
but I've seen
what you can do.

571
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:46,909
Frank!

572
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,873
You must think
I'm very stupid.

573
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,499
Excuse me.

574
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,128
<i>Lucy'</i>

575
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,715
ray says he loves you very much.

576
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,478
Here you are.
Here's your table.

577
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,189
Hi.
Hi.

578
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:23,528
Ls ray with us?

579
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,032
Yeah.

580
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,034
Tell her
she looks great.

581
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:33,747
He says that
you look great.

582
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,463
Tell her
they're from me.

583
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,006
Those are from ray.

584
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,717
It's our anniversary.

585
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,095
Right. He says
it's your anniversary.

586
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,932
Is ray beside me?

587
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,478
He's over here.

588
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,604
Oh.

589
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,774
Greetings. How are
you this evening?

590
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,235
May I offer you
some wine?

591
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:07,406
I don't know. Lucy, do you
want some, what, red, white?

592
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,533
Red, we always have red.

593
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,577
White. I've never
been fond of red.

594
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,663
Lucy!

595
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,378
So you used to be
an architect?

596
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,630
A long time ago.
Can it, bannister.

597
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,298
She doesn't want
to hear your life story.

598
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,301
Wow. So did you
build your own house?

599
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,096
I mean, you must
have a dream home.

600
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,389
You could call it
a dream home.

601
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,224
I'm gonna build you
a dream home, sweetheart,

602
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,600
just as soon as
i get on my feet.

603
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,019
Yeah.

604
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,313
Tell me, why is it that
you can see ray and I can't?

605
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,651
I was in an accident,
a car accident

606
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,071
about five years ago.

607
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,910
I don't know.
They say that

608
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:57,748
sometimes when you have
a traumatic experience

609
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,709
that it can alter
your perception.

610
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,546
Really, so after that
you could just see spirits?

611
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,506
I mean, what happened?

612
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:12,512
How about you talk to ray?
That's why I'm here.

613
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,223
Oh, finally, I'm in the
conversation. Terrific.

614
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:18,185
Well, actually I do have
an important question

615
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,394
that I have to ask ray.

616
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,313
Well, he can hear you.

617
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,529
Ray, I really need to know
where you invested my money,

618
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,826
the $16,000 that I had saved.

619
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,370
The attorneys can't seem
to find it anywhere.

620
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,957
Oh, shit. I blew it
on a bad investment.

621
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,377
But don't tell her that.
I'll think of something.

622
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,213
It's gone, Lucy. It's gone.

623
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,798
He blew it on
a bad investment.

624
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,716
You asshole!

625
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,468
Tell her everything's
gonna be okay.

626
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,012
I'm gonna look out for her. I'm
gonna move back into the house.

627
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,598
Tell her that.
No, that's not a good idea.

628
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,725
Bannister,
this doesn't concern you.

629
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,185
What's ray saying?
What's he saying?

630
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,729
He left. Ray left.

631
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:04,231
He said he was
he was sorry,

632
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,357
but he wanted to
leave you alone,

633
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,817
let you get on
with your life.

634
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,819
I swear to god, bannister,
I'm gonna kill you.

635
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,946
I can't believe it,
i mean...

636
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:14,407
That's just like ray to just
take the money and run, like...

637
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,372
Ray and I haven't been
honest with each other

638
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,540
in a long time,
Mr. bannister.

639
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,130
It wasn't what you would
call a good marriage.

640
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,257
You bitch!

641
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,849
Lucy, it's gonna be okay.

642
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,476
Get your hands
off my wife!

643
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,271
Goddamn it!

644
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:45,897
Sorry.

645
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,109
I can
move shit, bannister.

646
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,194
Man, you better
watch your back.

647
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,615
I better clean this up.
I'll be right back.

648
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,930
Good food, huh?

649
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,809
Yeah, it's great.

650
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:52,732
Mom.

651
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:22,679
Looks like
another heart attack

652
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,140
but I can't confirm it
till the autopsy.

653
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:26,433
Damn.

654
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,311
The waiter says he saw this
guy coming out of the John

655
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,521
about five minutes
before the body was found.

656
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,231
And who might
that have been?

657
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:34,316
Frank bannister.

658
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,192
He was as white
as a sheet and shaking.

659
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:37,652
Waiter thought
he'd been sick.

660
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:38,737
Damn.

661
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,157
Hl Lucy.
Lucy?

662
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,034
No.

663
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:46,369
Dr. lynskey works for me.
We're colleagues.

664
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:49,331
Look,doc, she's a material
witness, all right?

665
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:55,628
Okay.

666
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,176
Walt, bannister was last seen
in the restaurant parking lot.

667
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,969
He took off
at high speed.

668
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,892
Bring him in.

669
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:16,649
Hey! Look at that.

670
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,478
So your dead husband was having
dinner with you at the restaurant?

671
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,774
What did he order?

672
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:06,199
Oh, god. Excuse me.

673
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:07,909
Timmy.

674
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,592
Timmy,
front desk, please.

675
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,178
Thank you.

676
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:31,266
Lucy, this is special agent
Milton dammers of the FBI.

677
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,233
I came by train.

678
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,152
I was going to
take the flight

679
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,903
but I didn't feel good
about the plane.

680
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:46,739
At what time precisely

681
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,325
did bannister leave
for the bathroom?

682
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,871
You.
Uh...

683
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,374
I'm not sure, precisely.

684
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:00,003
Did he use excessive amounts
of table salt during his meal?

685
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,088
What?
Answer the question.

686
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,716
For Christ's sakes,
it's really late.

687
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:05,925
I can't remember
that, okay?

688
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,017
Oh, god. What is this?

689
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:17,103
Excuse me, Lucy,
I'll be right back.

690
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,276
Milton?

691
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,572
Sorry, sheriff.

692
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,950
I have a problem
with women yelling.

693
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:33,203
Milton, can i
get you anything?

694
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,205
Sheriff Perry!

695
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,333
You are violating
my territorial bubble.

696
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,211
Uh-huh.

697
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,638
Lucy, you're
still grieving.

698
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:55,016
It would be very easy for a
man like frank bannister

699
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,142
to take advantage.

700
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,729
You have such closed minds.
I can't believe it.

701
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,147
I object.

702
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,818
Special agent dammers

703
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:08,780
has over 20 years
experience in the area

704
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,033
of paranormal psychology.

705
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,870
Much of that was spent
undercover with various

706
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,414
cults and sects.

707
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:22,544
I get all the fruity
cases, Mrs. lynskey.

708
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:26,214
For god's sake, Milton, would
you come inside and sit down?

709
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,966
I'm more comfortable
standing. Thank you.

710
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,426
I really don't see what this has
to do with frank bannister.

711
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,930
Mrs. lynskey, you know nothing
about frank bannister.

712
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:36,266
You claim
he's a bona fide psychic

713
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:39,102
yet all I've heard is a lot of
ill-informed, meandering waffle.

714
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:43,189
On the third day
of July 1990,

715
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:47,569
frank bannister,
then a successful architect

716
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:50,363
was overseeing the
construction of his new home.

717
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:55,785
Now, the building contractor,
Jacob platz, would later confirm

718
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,038
that bannister had been
consuming alcohol that morning.

719
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:03,835
12:23 P.M.,
platz sees bannister

720
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,796
<i>in a heated argument
with his wife, Debra.</i>

721
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,632
It appears that bannister
had promised Debra a garden

722
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,050
in the new home

723
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:13,720
<i>and then, without consulting
her, proceeded to lay</i>

724
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,972
a <i>four-inch thick
concrete slab</i>

725
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,433
creating a basketball
court for himself.

726
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,645
12:31 P.M.

727
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:26,024
<i>Platz watches
the couple drive away.</i>

728
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:31,988
Bannister kept a tool box
in the back of his car.

729
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:36,200
And in it was a utility knife
with a retractable blade.

730
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:41,456
Bannister purchased
seven new blades

731
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,708
that morning

732
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,378
at jesson's hardware store
and building supply

733
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,006
on the corner of
3rd and Garrett.

734
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,257
3rd and Garrett.

735
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,759
Third of July.

736
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,511
Seven blades. Three.

737
00:50:56,095 --> 00:51:00,683
Milton, you're mumbling. We can't
understand a word you're saying.

738
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,185
12:33 P.M.

739
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:06,731
<i>And their '84 Volvo
heads into the hills.</i>

740
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,193
It is the last time anyone
will see the couple together.

741
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:12,862
Now, by bannister's
own admission,

742
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,864
<i>the argument
continues to rage</i>

743
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,700
reaching the climactic point when
Debra demands that bannister stop,

744
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,202
<i>pull over, let her out.</i>

745
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,538
And at that moment,
probably 12:36, 12:37 P.M.

746
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:25,625
The car leaves the road
on a sharp curve

747
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:30,296
presumably because bannister
was driving too fast.

748
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:32,882
She was killed?

749
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,721
Her body was found
some 15 yards from the car.

750
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,973
Now, bannister,

751
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:44,977
he was picked up two hours
later, wandering in the woods.

752
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:48,648
He claimed to have no recollection
of the events that ooourred

753
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,316
after the accident.

754
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,736
But here's the odd
thing, Mrs. lynskey.

755
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,865
His utility knife
was missing.

756
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:03,162
And to this day
it has not been found.

757
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:07,792
But do you know
what was really bizarre?

758
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,922
Debra's corpse
had the number 13

759
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,007
carved into its forehead.

760
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,387
Unlucky for some.

761
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:27,520
Oh, come on.
You're out of your mind.

762
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,439
You're talking about
a mythical figure.

763
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:32,525
A pseudo-religious icon
from the 12th century.

764
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:37,697
Save your pea brain prattle
for the classroom, boy.

765
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:41,701
That was the soul collector

766
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:46,789
and he's been taking people
out since time began.

767
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,711
He's going about some dark
business here in fairwater

768
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,630
and we ain't nothing
but worm bait.

769
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:59,719
When your number's up,
that's it.

770
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,143
There's another one gone.

771
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:02,907
He's gone.

772
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,577
There's no money for you here, Mr.
bannister.

773
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:09,872
You're next.

774
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:11,958
Are you threatening me?

775
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,669
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

776
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,003
He's threatening
to kill me.

777
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,171
Would you just
relax, all right?

778
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:18,214
Just listen to me and...

779
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,549
He's threatening
to kill me.

780
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:21,551
Bannister!
Oh, great.

781
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,302
Hey, fellows.
Okay. Excuse me.

782
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,929
What are you doing?

783
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,597
Excuse me.

784
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,474
Put the gun away, all right?
Freeze.

785
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:29,892
All right, everybody,
just take it easy.

786
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:30,977
Whoa, whoa!

787
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:45,324
Just stay there,
bannister. Stay there.

788
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:51,289
Yes.

789
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,131
Ah! Great.

790
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,507
I did it.

791
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:02,967
Judge.

792
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,927
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Bannister, stop.

793
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:08,973
Looks like I ain't shooting
with blanks no more.

794
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,478
Mighty fine woman.

795
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,355
Good teeth.

796
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:17,732
Now put your
hands on the podium.

797
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,191
Judge.

798
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,572
They don't call me the
hanging judge for nothing.

799
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,288
Stay right there.

800
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:37,960
Heads up.

801
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,712
Good catch.

802
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,194
Freeze!

803
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,451
Whoa!
Good shooting, Tex.

804
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,498
And she was so young
and beautiful!

805
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:33,432
I like it when they
lie still like that.

806
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,065
This is heavy.

807
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:49,448
My juices
are flowing again.

808
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,247
Judge!

809
00:56:57,957 --> 00:56:58,958
Judge!

810
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,377
Bannister!

811
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,879
Go, frank.
Just get out of here now.

812
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,172
Bastard!

813
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:08,801
Gotta go.

814
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,804
Bannister!
Stop.

815
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,250
Damn. Come on.

816
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,194
Just get down.
Get down and stay down.

817
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,411
Oh, no.

818
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,696
Magda!
No!

819
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,240
Listen to me.

820
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,671
Oh, god.

821
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:14,093
No!

822
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:20,808
No!

823
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,606
Oh, no.

824
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:36,157
You killed me,
you bastard!

825
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,868
You're sick. Ls this how
you get your kicks?

826
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,953
Did it feel good
killing me?

827
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:45,082
Bannister, did it feel
good killing your wife?

828
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:49,170
You're a murderer!

829
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,725
I don't believe
he'll get very far.

830
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,143
We've got
the state line covered.

831
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:05,811
Sheriff Perry,

832
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:09,857
I seriously doubt we will see
Mr. bannister any time soon.

833
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,444
The man is resourceful beyond
anything you can comprehend.

834
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:19,366
Hello, frank.

835
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:20,826
Hi, Walt.

836
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,497
I've come to report
that magda rees-Jones'

837
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:29,376
body is lying
near my car

838
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,338
off holloway road.

839
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:36,133
Frank, did you have anything
to do with her death?

840
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,263
Frank!

841
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:44,767
Frank, are you okay?
What happened?

842
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:47,978
What are you doing?

843
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:49,188
Are you arresting him?

844
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:50,731
Please leave,
Mrs. lynskey.

845
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,025
Frank. Frank,
you need a lawyer.

846
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,652
Go home, Lucy.

847
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,738
But you haven't done anything.
He hasn't done anything.

848
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,198
How do you know?

849
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:00,866
You know me?

850
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,953
Am I a nice guy,
Lucy? 'Cause

851
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:09,083
that cozy little scene in the
restaurant was bullshit,

852
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:12,336
I was doing my job.

853
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,963
And I don't give
a damn about you.

854
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,714
I don't give a
damn aboutanybody.

855
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:17,091
What the hell
are you saying?

856
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:18,509
Go home.

857
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,136
Okay.

858
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:27,851
Lucy, are you okay to drive?

859
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:29,311
Yeah.

860
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:43,575
Got a kiss
for honey bunny?

861
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,746
I know, I know.
It's the way I look.

862
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:51,333
It's this damn
ectoplasm stuff.

863
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:53,794
Turns you off,
doesn't it?

864
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,131
Come on, Lucy.
You're not listening to me!

865
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:01,051
Well, look, you know we
have a great relationship.

866
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:05,639
It's just that lately I don't feel
that you've been giving it your 100%.

867
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:11,937
There has been a destructive
force unleashed on this town

868
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:14,690
such as I have never seen.

869
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:19,695
We have a body count of

870
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,532
twenty-eight.

871
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:28,620
You're a very dangerous man,
Mr. bannister.

872
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:31,373
For Christ's sake you're
not seriously suggesting

873
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,791
that frank is
responsible for...

874
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,753
You're way out of your
depth here, sheriff Perry.

875
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:37,421
Please leave.

876
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:40,507
Frank bannister
is my prisoner.

877
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:45,846
By the power invested in me by the
President of the United States

878
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,389
lam telling you

879
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,726
to get the hell
out of this room.

880
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,970
Have you ever heard
of Nina kulagina?

881
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,643
March 10, 1970. Nina kulagina
with the power of her mind

882
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,020
stopped the beat
of a frog's heart.

883
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:38,482
The record of this experiment
is currently held

884
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,693
in the files
of professor gennady sergeyev

885
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:43,904
of Saint Petersburg.

886
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:47,950
And as sergeyev interpreted
this cardiogram

887
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,910
it seemed to him that the
heart had experienced

888
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,578
a sudden flare-up
of electrical activity.

889
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,664
The heart imploded,
the arteries burst

890
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:57,418
and all because Nina kulagina
wanted the animal dead.

891
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:03,382
I don't kill people.

892
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:10,514
There's a part of you
that believes that.

893
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,643
There's another
part of you, frank,

894
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,603
that's out of control.

895
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,690
Your destructive impulse.

896
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:24,903
I've seen a figure
in a cape.

897
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:30,159
I've seen him reach into people's
chests and squeeze their hearts.

898
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:33,287
Who was it?

899
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,460
Who was it?

900
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:43,589
Death.

901
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:48,510
I can communicate
with the other side.

902
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,472
I can see spirits.

903
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:56,685
I don't know why.
I can't understand it.

904
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:01,815
You think you're quite unique,
don't you, Mr. bannister?

905
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:06,820
But in my business, I deal with
your type every other week.

906
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:10,491
This death figure

907
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:14,161
is nothing more than
a homicidal alter ego

908
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:17,080
that satisfies
your compulsion to kill.

909
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,165
No.

910
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,334
Every time you want
to take somebody out

911
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,920
death figure suddenly appears,
does the job for you.

912
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:25,672
It's your rational mind's way
of absolving yourself of guilt.

913
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:27,341
No!

914
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:29,593
When did you first start
seeing spirits, frank?

915
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:31,470
After Debra's death?

916
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,724
You killed your wife.

917
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:36,892
No!

918
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:42,898
I have studied the ooroner's reports of
every death in fairwater sinoe 1985.

919
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:47,110
Twenty-eight cases
involved crushed hearts.

920
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:49,905
Arteries choked
until they burst.

921
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,075
That started
in 1990 with your

922
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,411
beautiful wife, Debra.

923
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:59,248
She was the first.

924
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,252
Ray lynskey.

925
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:06,171
You have an argument with
him, three hours later, dead.

926
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:09,758
Magda rees-Jones,
we know you didn't like her.

927
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,678
But what about the guy
in the toilet?

928
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,806
What did he
do to you, frank?

929
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,434
Piss on your hush puppies?

930
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:23,897
Why are you shaking?

931
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,777
Oh, my-

932
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:32,906
you're doing it right now,
aren't you?

933
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,411
You're trying to kill me.
Right now.

934
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,914
Forget it, bannister.

935
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:44,251
I'm wearing
a lead breastplate!

936
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:49,214
We have 28
unexplained deaths here.

937
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:51,216
You know what I think?

938
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,637
I think you are involved in
each and every one of them.

939
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:02,936
This way.

940
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:04,604
Mmm.

941
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,606
No.

942
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:12,321
Hey, man! Pulling your drawers off.
Man, what the hell?

943
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:17,242
Benny? My man, Benny! Stu, this
is my boy here, Benny, man!

944
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,286
Hey, Benny, I'm your
friend, man. Seriously.

945
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:21,246
Three words,
"shower with soap."

946
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:22,831
Come on!

947
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,250
Stu, you all right?

948
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,585
Spasm, spasm.
It's all right.

949
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:29,671
Frank.
Frank, we got problems.

950
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:31,965
These cats are gonna stitch
you up on a capital offence.

951
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:33,925
These murders that have
been going on in fairwater,

952
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,510
they're gonna
pin 'em on you.

953
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:38,722
Stu and I are gonna get you out of
here, so oome on, man, let's go.

954
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,016
Frank?

955
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:46,188
Frank! Come out of it, man.

956
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,731
Wait, no, wait, wait.

957
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:51,234
Oh, god.
Forget it, stu.

958
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,153
Look at him.

959
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:57,657
He doesn't
believe anymore.

960
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,120
It won't be long now.

961
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:05,707
He's reached
the acceptance stage.

962
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:09,002
Grappling with his guilt.

963
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,214
Seeking resolution.

964
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:16,385
You realize,
agent dammers,

965
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:19,262
we have no forensic evidence linking
him with any of the deaths.

966
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:20,555
Doesn't matter.

967
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:25,477
I expect this case to suicide
long before iteverreachestfial

968
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,402
they always do.

969
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,576
So much for the dream home.

970
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:25,454
What the hell are
we doing here, Lucy?

971
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,457
I mean, look at this place.
It's a dump.

972
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:31,334
God, this guy's a loser.

973
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:33,837
Oh, my god, Lucy.

974
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:37,215
Look at this.
Look at this.

975
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:41,011
He set us up, Lucy.
The man set us up.

976
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:42,804
This is our house!

977
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:46,558
He took us for a couple
of sohmuoks, luoy.

978
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:48,310
Look, Lucy, look!

979
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:25,597
Perfectly good basketball
court gone to pot.

980
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,724
Yeah, bannister.

981
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,269
<i>Mr. bannister,
you've got to help me.</i>

982
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:33,104
<i>My daughter,
Patricia Ann Bradley,</i>

983
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:35,398
<i>is communing
with the evil one.</i>

984
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,359
<i>He's in this house
at her instigation.</i>

985
01:10:38,527 --> 01:10:41,488
<i>Help me.
Help me drive them out.</i>

986
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:08,431
Lucy, I don't know why you
keep shutting me out.

987
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:10,225
I still have a lot to...

988
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:15,230
Lucy!

989
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:20,986
Patricia.

990
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:27,409
Patricia.

991
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:32,080
Dr. lynskey.

992
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,331
Patricia,
are you all right?

993
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,599
It's your mother,
isn't it?

994
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:52,392
Your mother's the one
who's been hurting you.

995
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:01,610
She needs help. She's
delusional, Patricia.

996
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,487
You can't go on like this.

997
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,283
You don't understand.

998
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:15,790
No!

999
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,341
My father killed himself
after the murders.

1000
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,136
Mother says
it was my fault.

1001
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,307
So I have to keep
his ashes in my room.

1002
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:36,686
Oh, my god.

1003
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,824
She says I'm evil

1004
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,994
just like Johnny.

1005
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:03,755
Come with me
to mother's room.

1006
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,605
This isn't you.

1007
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,651
This isn't who you are now.

1008
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:30,407
It was Johnny.

1009
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:33,785
He went crazy.

1010
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,122
I couldn't get
away from him.

1011
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,165
I thought
he was gonna kill me.

1012
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:41,626
Patricia, you have to
get out of this house.

1013
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,628
You can start over.

1014
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:54,681
It's mother.
Please hide. Please.

1015
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,893
I'll take her
to the kitchen.

1016
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,521
You sneak out later.

1017
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:09,821
What are you doing
in my room?

1018
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:11,990
I thought
i heard a noise.

1019
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:16,661
I'll make you
some coffee, mother.

1020
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:10,173
Mother, coffee's ready.

1021
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,315
Lucy,go.

1022
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:01,724
Frank.

1023
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,104
Thank you, deputy.

1024
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:09,274
Just call me when
you're done, Dr. lynskey.

1025
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,525
Yes.

1026
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,656
Frank. Frank, listen to me.
I found your knife.

1027
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,826
It was hidden in old lady
Bradley's closet.

1028
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,369
She's crazy, frank.

1029
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:25,206
You haven't
hurt anybody.

1030
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,627
You're a good
person, frank.

1031
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,507
Don't do this.

1032
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,219
Please don't do this.

1033
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:46,311
Jesus, do you think that
you're the only person

1034
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:47,896
who's ever lost somebody?

1035
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:51,149
God, you walk around like
you don't have any feelings

1036
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:53,610
but the truth is
that you're just scared.

1037
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,905
You're a goddamn hypocrite.
Why are you doing this?

1038
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:58,448
What are you
afraid of, frank?

1039
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:11,127
I don't want to
hurt you, Lucy.

1040
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,463
Oh, that's crap.
Don't give me that.

1041
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,510
Look at me.

1042
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,673
No. Uh-uh.
I'll be outside.

1043
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,800
This shit is like walking
in on your parents.

1044
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:06,099
Oh, right. Yeah, I'll just be outside.
I'll just... whoa!

1045
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,897
What is it, frank?

1046
01:18:12,981 --> 01:18:13,982
Look out!

1047
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:16,818
You son of a bitch.

1048
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,205
What's happening?

1049
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,332
Grab him!

1050
01:18:34,002 --> 01:18:35,461
What's happening?

1051
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,552
Okay. Listen. Listen to me.

1052
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:46,180
Call for the deputy
and try to sound calm.

1053
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:50,059
Deputy, I'm ready
to leave now.

1054
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,778
Stuart, where did he go?

1055
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:02,321
I think we got him.

1056
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,375
Shit.

1057
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:17,211
No, you son of bitch!
Get out, frank! Go!

1058
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,423
Frank!

1059
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,053
This way. Go.

1060
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:30,600
Freeze, bannister!

1061
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,684
All right.

1062
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:35,938
Help.
I got you now.

1063
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,149
Please help me.
He's gone crazy.

1064
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,484
All right.

1065
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,778
Stay back.

1066
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:43,404
Now...

1067
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:49,327
Frank, come on!

1068
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,746
Go, frank! Get out here!
Please! Now!

1069
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,583
Frank, let's go!

1070
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:03,341
No, this way. Come on.

1071
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:20,566
Shit!

1072
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:20,608
Shit!

1073
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:21,526
Shit!

1074
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:23,277
What was that
in that cell, frank?

1075
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:25,571
I felt something
crushing my heart.

1076
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,658
I can't fight him, luce.
I can't protect you.

1077
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,914
There's only one way
to deal with this thing.

1078
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,625
I got to have an
out-of-body expefience.

1079
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:38,709
What?

1080
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:40,586
And I got to
have it right now.

1081
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,712
No!

1082
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:44,132
Go away, luce.
Just walk the other way.

1083
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:47,552
Wait.

1084
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:55,518
This will slow your heart rate
and lower your body temperature.

1085
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,654
You'll have
20 minutes, Max.

1086
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:10,032
Any longer than that and there's
a danger of tissue damage.

1087
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:12,493
That's only if I can
successfully revive you

1088
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:14,495
and there's no guarantee.

1089
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:16,497
Frank,

1090
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,084
you don't have to do this.

1091
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:22,753
Lucy, better close the door.

1092
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:24,338
Hurry up-

1093
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,799
it won't take long.

1094
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:48,839
I didn't know you had an interest
in cryogenics, dr.Lynskey.

1095
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,217
I'm reviving him at 9:00.

1096
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,219
Why would we
want to do that?

1097
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:39,307
Luce.

1098
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,393
Lucy.

1099
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:43,936
Whoa!

1100
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:52,987
There we go.

1101
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,922
Let me go, you bastard.
Let me go!

1102
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:16,010
Let me out now, you bastard!
Let me out of this car now!

1103
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:41,971
I find cemeteries very

1104
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:45,015
restful places,
don't you?

1105
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:48,936
Turn this car around
and take me back.

1106
01:25:49,103 --> 01:25:51,147
I intend to, Mrs. lynskey.

1107
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:56,360
In exactly 11 hours time.

1108
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:58,195
Son of a bitch!

1109
01:25:58,279 --> 01:25:59,738
No. No.

1110
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:10,833
I knew Charlie.

1111
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,461
Spahn ranch, 1969.

1112
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:15,588
First assignment.

1113
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:22,928
I was the family's
sex slave for six months.

1114
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:25,764
Six months

1115
01:26:26,307 --> 01:26:32,104
in the service of my country
disguised as a whippy shippy.

1116
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,115
I want out.

1117
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:52,082
Let me out of here! Come
back here, you creep!

1118
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:14,939
My body is
a road map of pain.

1119
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:19,610
1974.

1120
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:24,615
Children of Lucifer.

1121
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:30,913
Three years undercover,
drinking goat's blood.

1122
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:37,086
1981, I infiltrated
the cult of the dead.

1123
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:42,925
I was involved in
ritualistic cannibalism,

1124
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:47,221
in orgiastic dances

1125
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:52,059
reaching painful thresholds of
intense, physical eroticism.

1126
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:56,814
I have withstood
excruciating pain,

1127
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:03,237
but I will not be broken.

1128
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:10,369
I have suffered
for my country,

1129
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:16,709
Lucy.

1130
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,587
But pain

1131
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,798
has its reward.

1132
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,264
The power of the mind

1133
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:33,976
is absolute.

1134
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:49,992
Frank.

1135
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:52,870
Frank, is that you?

1136
01:28:56,874 --> 01:29:00,961
I'm doing this?

1137
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:04,590
I'm making the car move
with the power of my mind?

1138
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:06,300
Yes!

1139
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,302
No.

1140
01:29:08,636 --> 01:29:09,762
Wait!

1141
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:16,226
Get back in
the goddamn ground

1142
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:19,647
you unorganized grab-asstic
gob of teleplasmic shit!

1143
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:38,290
Who in the hell are you? Sound
off like you've got a pair!

1144
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:54,181
Hey, asshole.

1145
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,653
Who are you?

1146
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:56,785
Who are you?

1147
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,794
Johnny bartlett.

1148
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:08,547
I thought guys like
you fried in hell.

1149
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,800
I got out, frank.

1150
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:17,681
I've been carrying on the good work.
Got me a score of 40.

1151
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:32,905
Harry sinclair.

1152
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:35,449
I just want to shake
the hand of the man

1153
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:36,909
who finally
avenged my death.

1154
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:39,203
You've got a number.

1155
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:44,082
Bartlett carved it into my
forehead as I lay dying.

1156
01:31:45,584 --> 01:31:46,752
I was the last.

1157
01:31:47,461 --> 01:31:50,506
He couldn't be more wrong,
could he, frank?

1158
01:31:58,722 --> 01:31:59,765
Shit!

1159
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:37,052
No! Don't use it.

1160
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:39,805
No.

1161
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:50,232
Frank. Okay. Just breathe.

1162
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,359
Breathe slowly. Breathe.

1163
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:54,236
Okay. You're okay.

1164
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:55,696
Okay. Frank.

1165
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,159
All right, Lucy, come on.

1166
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:03,537
A hundred milligrams
of Lidocaine.

1167
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:06,206
Get me one cc of
adrenaline, quick, now.

1168
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:09,167
I didn't get him.

1169
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,128
Who?

1170
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:13,505
Who didn't you get, frank?

1171
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:15,507
Johnny bartlett.

1172
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:17,426
He's back.

1173
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,304
He's hallucinating.
It'll pass.

1174
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:21,513
<i>Lucy'</i>

1175
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,182
he's killing again.

1176
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:26,268
Patricia.

1177
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:31,189
Lucy, you got to get her
out of the house.

1178
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:35,027
Go!

1179
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,502
Patricia! Patricia!

1180
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:57,674
Listen to me. We have
to get out of here.

1181
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:00,177
Patricia
never leaves the house.

1182
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,304
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bradley,
but she's coming with me.

1183
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,389
You have no right. She's my daughter.
Get upstairs.

1184
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,768
No. Look, this is
gonna stop now.

1185
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:09,353
What are you
talking about?

1186
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:12,189
Why do you have frank bannister's
knife in your closet?

1187
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:14,858
You went in my room?

1188
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:17,152
Mother.

1189
01:34:17,361 --> 01:34:18,528
Patricia.

1190
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:57,776
Mother wants to go
to the police now.

1191
01:34:58,235 --> 01:34:59,569
No,

1192
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:01,780
she'll be down
in a few minutes.

1193
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:04,032
No, Patricia,
we have to go now.

1194
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:07,452
It's just not safe here.
Johnny bartlett's back.

1195
01:35:09,705 --> 01:35:10,914
I know.

1196
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,044
He visits me at night.

1197
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:21,133
I don't know
why he comes.

1198
01:35:21,717 --> 01:35:23,260
He torments me.

1199
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:26,471
Why has he come?

1200
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:30,308
Am I being punished?

1201
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:33,395
Patricia, please.
Let's just go now, please.

1202
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,355
I wanna kill
her now, Patty.

1203
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:40,569
That'll give us 41.

1204
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:42,612
That's eight clear of gacy.

1205
01:35:42,988 --> 01:35:45,824
Another nine and we'll have
broken Bundy's record.

1206
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:48,744
I can't wait to see old Ted's
face when he hears the news.

1207
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:50,495
Yes!

1208
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:51,955
What?

1209
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:55,292
I'm sorry.

1210
01:35:57,127 --> 01:35:59,129
We really should
wait for mother.

1211
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:04,718
And that asswipe psychic nearly
ruined it for us tonight, Patty.

1212
01:36:06,803 --> 01:36:08,013
He made us look stupid.

1213
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:09,723
You're gonna be
okay, Patricia.

1214
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:11,016
Everything's going
to be all right.

1215
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,392
Shut up.

1216
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:14,394
That Russian cannibal
c:Reep's running around

1217
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:16,062
saying he did 50 plus.

1218
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,192
That reflects badly
on the both of us, Patty.

1219
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:25,071
This record should be
held by an American.

1220
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,656
I quite agree.

1221
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:29,743
You can come

1222
01:36:32,788 --> 01:36:34,331
stay with me
if you like.

1223
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:35,874
I'm going to
kill her now, baby.

1224
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:37,959
I'd like that.

1225
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:48,220
I'll just get my coat.

1226
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:55,435
Patronizing
do-gooder bitch!

1227
01:36:58,271 --> 01:36:59,648
Patricia,

1228
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:03,819
you kill her, I'll watch.

1229
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,344
I love it when
you do that, baby.

1230
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:39,729
Mrs. Bradley?

1231
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:45,569
Mrs. Bradley,
are you coming with us?

1232
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:51,283
Oh, my god.

1233
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:28,653
Lucy!

1234
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:47,631
No, not that way!

1235
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:17,953
Jesus, Lucy.

1236
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:25,043
Oh, my god. These are
Johnny bartlett's ashes.

1237
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:26,211
What?

1238
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:28,171
We gotta get these
to the other side.

1239
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:29,255
For what?

1240
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:31,925
A church. We got to
get them to a church.

1241
01:39:32,384 --> 01:39:35,470
There's a chapel. There's a
chapel in the old hospital.

1242
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:37,138
All right.

1243
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:40,225
No!

1244
01:39:58,785 --> 01:39:59,953
No, let's go down here.

1245
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:01,162
Okay.

1246
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:09,504
Damn it!

1247
01:40:49,169 --> 01:40:51,713
Okay. You see that door?
Hold on, let me see.

1248
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:00,055
You look up there.
Okay.

1249
01:41:12,067 --> 01:41:13,193
Thank you.

1250
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:18,323
Lucy?

1251
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:27,582
This is great.

1252
01:41:31,086 --> 01:41:32,253
Frank?

1253
01:41:34,714 --> 01:41:37,509
Excuse me, doctor,
we're looking for ward 12.

1254
01:41:38,384 --> 01:41:40,595
Go up the stairs
to the fourth floor

1255
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:41,971
down the corridor
to your right.

1256
01:41:42,055 --> 01:41:43,640
It's just opposite
the chapel.

1257
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:44,766
Thank you.

1258
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,976
I'll get someone
to help. Orderly.

1259
01:41:47,811 --> 01:41:49,687
Orderly, are you deaf?

1260
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:53,149
I said, orderly,
are you deaf?

1261
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,028
Moron!

1262
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:09,207
I guess that
makes you number one.

1263
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:11,709
Get down!

1264
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:16,381
Frank, are you okay?

1265
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,300
The chapel's
on the fourth floor.

1266
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,337
Frank, watch out!

1267
01:43:08,725 --> 01:43:10,518
Gotta go. Go!

1268
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:47,555
Lucy.

1269
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:50,808
Lucy.

1270
01:43:54,354 --> 01:43:55,647
Lucy!

1271
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:15,917
You're all the same.

1272
01:44:26,803 --> 01:44:27,929
Wait!

1273
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,014
No!

1274
01:45:29,741 --> 01:45:33,286
Put the gun down, son.
The law is on its way.

1275
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:36,205
What's the score, Patty?

1276
01:45:40,752 --> 01:45:41,961
Eleven.

1277
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:44,630
That's the same
as starkweather's.

1278
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:49,719
We have a tie on our hands.

1279
01:46:24,504 --> 01:46:25,630
Lucy.

1280
01:46:25,755 --> 01:46:26,923
Frank.

1281
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:32,678
It's jammed.

1282
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:38,768
Take it. Just take it.
Right.

1283
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:42,313
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

1284
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:43,523
No.

1285
01:47:08,965 --> 01:47:10,174
Give that to me.

1286
01:47:10,299 --> 01:47:11,551
Let me guess.

1287
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:15,596
You have to get these ashes
to consecrated ground

1288
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,766
in order to destroy
the forces of evil.

1289
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,893
Give me
the goddamn urn, dammers!

1290
01:47:20,977 --> 01:47:25,398
Under no circumstances must
these ashes ever be released.

1291
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:27,942
No!

1292
01:47:29,861 --> 01:47:32,071
Oops.

1293
01:47:33,656 --> 01:47:36,075
You have no idea
what you've just done.

1294
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:41,247
You just don't get it,
do you, frank?

1295
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:47,670
Your pathological mindset
had made it necessary

1296
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:50,965
for you to interpret your
sad, personal inadequacies

1297
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:53,050
as a grand struggle
between good and evil

1298
01:47:53,134 --> 01:47:57,346
in order to gratify your pathetic
need for self-glorification.

1299
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:04,562
You are such an asshole.

1300
01:48:06,606 --> 01:48:09,567
Yes, I am.
I'm an asshole

1301
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:11,485
with an uzi.

1302
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,488
Get up!

1303
01:48:15,281 --> 01:48:17,033
You make me sick! Get up!

1304
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,785
Turn around. I don't want
to shoot you in the back.

1305
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:22,205
Turn around!
I said, turn around!

1306
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:25,583
As an agent of the
United States government

1307
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:27,919
I am ordering you
to turn around.

1308
01:48:47,063 --> 01:48:48,231
Frank!

1309
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:09,043
Please! Please don't hurt me.
Stop!

1310
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:25,601
Please!

1311
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,288
Frank!

1312
01:49:46,664 --> 01:49:48,791
Oh, my god. Frank.

1313
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:04,890
Debra.

1314
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:27,204
You killed her.

1315
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:33,210
You're next, pal.

1316
01:50:36,714 --> 01:50:38,215
Take him out, baby.

1317
01:50:49,018 --> 01:50:50,436
No! Get him!

1318
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:53,898
No! Stop!

1319
01:50:57,151 --> 01:50:58,319
Frank!

1320
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:02,782
No!

1321
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:07,703
Get him, Patty.

1322
01:51:10,748 --> 01:51:11,832
Yeah, baby.

1323
01:51:22,176 --> 01:51:23,219
Whoo!

1324
01:51:33,521 --> 01:51:35,773
Oh, baby, you are an artist.

1325
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:39,443
You're pretty, too.
No!

1326
01:51:44,907 --> 01:51:45,908
No.

1327
01:51:51,414 --> 01:51:52,456
Yes.

1328
01:52:02,633 --> 01:52:04,802
I'm in the mood
for a little vivisection.

1329
01:52:05,261 --> 01:52:06,929
No! Oh, please.

1330
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,305
Me, too.

1331
01:52:14,979 --> 01:52:16,480
You bitch!

1332
01:52:16,564 --> 01:52:17,857
No!

1333
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:24,738
Igotyour
ghhflend,johnny!

1334
01:52:25,823 --> 01:52:26,949
Come and get her!

1335
01:52:27,324 --> 01:52:28,993
No, goddamn you!
Let go of her!

1336
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:30,995
Johnny!
Come and get her, you coward!

1337
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:32,163
Come on and get her!

1338
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:33,289
No!

1339
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,166
Let go off my Patty!

1340
01:52:39,003 --> 01:52:40,171
Patty!

1341
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:47,845
Johnny!

1342
01:53:01,567 --> 01:53:03,486
Come here.
Give me your hand.

1343
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:14,955
See you later, frank.
We got you.

1344
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:17,833
We're going back down
to get us some more!

1345
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:19,877
Yo, frank.

1346
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:24,757
How's it going?

1347
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:28,385
Bye, frank.

1348
01:53:32,223 --> 01:53:33,432
Johnny.

1349
01:53:34,934 --> 01:53:36,101
Step back, frank.
Yeah.

1350
01:53:36,185 --> 01:53:37,353
This isn't going
to be pleasant.

1351
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:13,973
The old express bus to hell.
No lines, no waiting.

1352
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:26,902
It's really something,
isn't it?

1353
01:54:27,194 --> 01:54:28,737
Excellent libraries.

1354
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:30,781
Premium cigars.

1355
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:34,577
And of course,
the honeys.

1356
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:38,163
Yeah, how about that? Stu's a
regular chick magnet up here.

1357
01:54:44,628 --> 01:54:45,629
Hello, frank.

1358
01:54:48,674 --> 01:54:50,134
It's time to go home.

1359
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:52,928
I am home.

1360
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:55,848
No.

1361
01:54:56,056 --> 01:54:58,434
You see, the
authorities have informed us

1362
01:54:58,517 --> 01:55:00,769
that it's just
not your time.

1363
01:55:02,438 --> 01:55:03,981
Start living, dude.

1364
01:55:10,362 --> 01:55:11,655
Be happy-

1365
01:55:28,505 --> 01:55:29,673
frank!

1366
01:56:08,545 --> 01:56:10,130
There's something
i have to tell you.

1367
01:56:10,214 --> 01:56:11,340
Yeah?

1368
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:20,849
Sorry to
interrupt you, folks.

1369
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:22,476
It's all right, Walt.

1370
01:56:25,312 --> 01:56:28,649
Frank, what do you know
about ouija boards?

1371
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:29,858
Not a lot.

1372
01:56:30,025 --> 01:56:32,653
Ifound a whole stack of them
up at the Bradley house.

1373
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:35,572
It looks like Patricia just
got herself a direct line

1374
01:56:35,656 --> 01:56:38,701
to her dead boyfriend as soon as
she was released five years ago.

1375
01:56:38,909 --> 01:56:40,452
It seems like the old lady,

1376
01:56:40,536 --> 01:56:42,955
when she caught wind
of Patricia's involvement in,

1377
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:49,086
well, in your wife's death, that
she just kept the girl sedated.

1378
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:51,130
She just couldn't
stop bartlett, though.

1379
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:54,007
Nice epilogue, Walt.
It was well delivered.

1380
01:56:55,843 --> 01:56:57,469
Frank.

1381
01:56:58,595 --> 01:57:00,556
Just one other little thing.
Uh-huh.

1382
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:04,101
I got a whole bucket load of
vacation time coming to me

1383
01:57:04,226 --> 01:57:05,561
and I thought...
Good.

1384
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:06,645
...l thought you and I

1385
01:57:06,729 --> 01:57:09,231
could collaborate on
a book about all this.

1386
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:11,024
It could be my
ticket off the force.

1387
01:57:11,108 --> 01:57:12,568
That's not
really my area.

1388
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:13,902
If you're looking
for a collaborator

1389
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,654
how about your guardian
angel over there?

1390
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:26,165
You got me, frank.

1391
01:57:26,248 --> 01:57:27,249
I got you, Walt.

1392
01:57:31,336 --> 01:57:34,006
I'll see you, frank.
Bye-bye.

1393
01:57:38,635 --> 01:57:40,929
Boy, that dammers,
he sure looks pissed.

1394
01:57:41,013 --> 01:57:42,055
Yeah.

1395
01:57:44,808 --> 01:57:46,393
Well, sometimes,
frank, you see

1396
01:57:46,477 --> 01:57:48,479
when you go through
a traumatic experience

1397
01:57:48,562 --> 01:57:50,355
it kind of alters
your perception.

1398
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:54,234
No.
