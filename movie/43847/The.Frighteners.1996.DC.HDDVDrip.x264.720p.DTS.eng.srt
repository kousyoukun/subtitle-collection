00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:35,773
Dr. Lynskey, I'm on my way.

158
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:48,497
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.

159
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:49,620
Dr. Lynskey?

160
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,980
- Yes. Thank you for coming.
- The...

161
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:55,300
The activity is currently
located where?

162
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,821
Well, I don't know. It just
went quiet about five minutes ago.

163
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:01,304
Went quiet?

164
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:04,896
The dining room table spun
in a counterclockwise direction?

165
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:07,815
I don't think that one happened. No.

166
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:11,735
The toilet seat lid
banged up and down?

167
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:12,860
No.

168
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:16,461
- Did the bed levitate?
- Yeah, with me on it.

169
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:20,541
Spontaneous recurrent psychokinesis.
Oh, boy.

170
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:24,099
This could be the worst case
I've ever seen.

171
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:25,937
Yeah, this is bad.

172
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,576
Okay. Well, folks,
I can do a clearance...

173
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:31,815
but it's not gonna be cheap.

174
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:34,022
Although I do offer
a six-month guarantee.

175
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:35,174
How much?

176
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,900
$249.95.

177
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:42,024
But there is a 30% surcharge for
making a house call after midnight.

178
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:43,933
Then there's vehicle, gas...

179
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,016
so I'd say the whole thing
is gonna set you back...

180
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,983
somewhere in the neighbourhood
of $450.

181
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:55,694
Although we could forget about the
fence, call the whole thing even.

182
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:57,059
Do it.

183
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:02,694
Okay. Excuse me, ma'am.
You wanna stand back.

184
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:04,855
I don't want you
to have to sign a waiver.

185
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,379
Plus $100 for materials.
I can't be out of pocket.

186
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:10,059
Just do it,
for Christ's sakes, Bannister.

187
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,458
Here we go.

188
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,140
All righty.

189
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:20,303
Why us?
I mean, why are they in our house?

190
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:23,622
All I can tell you is emanations are
normally confined to the cemetery...

191
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:24,933
although they do escape.

192
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,583
It's usually the young ones.

193
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,781
For God's sakes, Bannister, come on.

194
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:31,783
Come on.

195
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:37,894
[Gun whirring]

196
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:39,338
It's holy water.

197
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:54,217
This is bullshit.
This is total bullshit.

198
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,416
Come on. Yes!

199
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:03,821
Okay, these belong to you.

200
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:06,260
Six ectoplasmic emanations.

201
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:08,776
Don't worry. They can't escape.

202
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:11,419
Some people like a souvenir.
Where would you like me to put them?

203
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,224
No. I really don't think
we wanna hang onto those.

204
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,533
So, thank you.

205
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:18,419
- Do we, hon?
- I could give a rat's ass.

206
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,100
Okay.

207
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,420
Don't worry,
they can't feel a thing.

208
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,780
At least that's what it says
in the book.

209
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:31,738
You never really know for sure.

210
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:35,855
All right. Thank you, Bannister.
You can go.

211
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:41,741
What the hell are you staring at?

212
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:45,543
What's with the number?

213
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:47,018
What number?

214
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:52,459
Look, if you're trying to freak me
out, it's not gonna work, okay?

215
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,580
You know what he's trying to do?

216
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:56,304
He's trying to get more money
out of us is what he's trying to do.

217
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:59,343
Here, take your shit
and get the hell out of my house.

218
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:00,494
Come on.

219
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:03,460
- Move.
- Ray, just...

220
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,583
Thank you so much.

221
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:13,817
- There you go.
- Thanks.

222
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,179
Thank you.

223
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,943
Why do you always
have to alienate everybody?

224
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:45,576
I think I'm going to throw up.

225
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:48,014
Damn.

226
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:10,937
Man, I hate that trunk!

227
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:13,414
Yeah, I don't want you guys
spreading your ectoplasmic muck...

228
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:14,620
all over my car seats.

229
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:17,424
Ain't that a bitch. The ectoplasm's
the only thing sticky enough...

230
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:18,824
to hold the damn car together.

231
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:21,977
Look, Frank, I'm sorry about your
pus yellow, piece-of-shit Volvo...

232
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:25,023
but we ain't riding in the damn
trunk no more, you understand?

233
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,142
We would like to cruise
with some style, man.

234
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:30,181
You know, you guys
left me high and dry tonight.

235
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:32,495
I get to the house,
nothing's happening.

236
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:34,098
I couldn't believe it.

237
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,501
Stuart, in or out?

238
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:41,176
You guys didn't even
bang the toilet seat lid?

239
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,664
You made me look like an asshole.

240
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:45,737
We strained our backs
lifting that heavy ass bed, Frank.

241
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:47,817
Yeah. Who was the idiot...

242
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:50,214
who put the number
in the guy's forehead?

243
00:18:51,985 --> 00:18:53,304
It wasn't funny.

244
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:55,818
Start pulling your weight, guys...

245
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:57,338
or you're going back
to the cemetery.

246
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:59,575
Yeah, well,
you can pull this, Frank.

247
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:01,974
I'm about to go like Jesse
on your ass.

248
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,703
I'm gonna find me
some other black ghosts...

249
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:05,616
and then organise a march.

250
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:08,503
The African American
Apparition Coalition.

251
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,024
The AAAC.

252
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,663
And I'm gonna tell you
something, Frank!

253
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:14,259
There ain't nothing worse than
a bunch of pissed off brothers...

254
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:15,778
that's already dead!

255
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:18,376
Would someone help me, please?

256
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:22,814
Stu, man, you got to loosen up, man.
I'm serious.

257
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,381
Come on, Stu, loosen up.

258
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,660
Loosen up. Okay, you loose?
All right.

259
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:32,699
So tight you can play pick-up
sticks with your butt cheeks.

260
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:37,895
Loosen up. Just particlise.
There you go.

261
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,420
Damn.

262
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:44,496
That fellow takes us
totally for granted.

263
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:48,780
And we're supposed to be
his business partners.

264
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:52,934
What a joke. I'm gonna straighten
him out first thing in the morning.

265
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,337
He's dealing
with a double major here.

266
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:58,974
Well, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
I'm gonna get rough.

267
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:01,335
- You talking to me, Stuart?
- No.

268
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:04,258
See, Stuart, that's your problem.
You're too soft with him.

269
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:07,382
You gotta just walk up to Frank,
just look him in the eye and say:

270
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,457
"Frank, give me what I want
or I'm gonna bust your ass!"

271
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,534
You, Frank, how's it hanging?

272
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:35,219
I don't know, Cyrus. You tell me.

273
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:38,297
Well, Frank, I'll tell you
the women ain't missing nothing.

274
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:41,741
Come on. I told you guys,
stay the hell out of my plumbing.

275
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:44,583
Look. Come on, Frank.

276
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:47,304
Look, we wanna call a meeting, man.
We gotta rap.

277
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:49,854
Cyrus, I gotta take a leak...

278
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:51,783
and I'm not getting out
of the shower.

279
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:52,934
Goodbye.

280
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:58,416
Therefore, a happy ghost
is a productive ghost.

281
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:02,694
To that end, I've drawn up
a list of suggestions.

282
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,099
Now bear in mind, Frank...

283
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:06,983
that we have given you
five years of loyal service.

284
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:12,582
Flies. That's what you've given me,
Stuart. Flies.

285
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:15,577
Why is it that flies stick
to you guys like shit to a blanket?

286
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,781
Very funny. You a funny guy, Frank.

287
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:19,583
You know, all you think about
is yourself.

288
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:21,064
You know, I can complain, too,
you know.

289
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:23,295
I would like some new clothes.
You get to dress nice.

290
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:25,421
Here I am still looking like Linc
from <i>The Mod Squad.</i>

291
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,621
You died in the '70s. It's a bummer.

292
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:30,060
I think what Cyrus is attempting
to say, Frank...

293
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:32,943
is that we don't feel
that the enterprise is evolving...

294
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,664
in quite the manner
in which we all agree.

295
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,976
Please don't reach through me...

296
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:42,023
when I'm trying to speak to you.

297
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,617
Now, Frank,
we gotta talk about cigars.

298
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:54,740
- Cigars?
- Damn right.

299
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:56,816
You've been promising me a box
for I don't know how long.

300
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:59,135
Cyrus, I hate to break this to you
but you're dead, you know.

301
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:00,260
You can't smoke.

302
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:03,098
Well, you can light them up
and blow the smoke in my face.

303
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:06,097
If I light up a cigar,
I'll blow my lunch in your face.

304
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:07,379
[Dog whining]

305
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:10,335
Everybody, get down! Damn it, Judge!

306
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:17,702
Put the shooters away.

307
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:24,093
[Whimpering]

308
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,813
That was a head shot, Frank.
He could have killed me.

309
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:29,975
You know, if I wanted
to get shot at every day...

310
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:32,374
I'd move my black ass
to Los Angeles!

469
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:48,893
to go through the other side again.

470
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:50,737
To become what's known
as a pure spirit.

471
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,498
But in the meantime, you're what's
known as an earthbound emanation...

472
00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:55,860
which is a rotting cloud
of bioplasmic particles...

473
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:58,140
dripping ectoplasm
from every orifice.

474
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:01,618
[Ray sobbing]

475
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:06,544
Relax, Ray.

476
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:12,542
All right, Bannister...

477
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:15,818
can you at least give me a ride
so I don't miss my funeral?

478
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:23,224
Okay, Ray, listen up.

479
00:32:23,305 --> 00:32:26,536
The cemetery is not a safe place,
all right? So stay close.

480
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,856
Later, Bannister. I want to hear
what they're saying about me.

481
00:32:39,185 --> 00:32:40,254
[Exclaiming in fear]

482
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:43,257
Don't worry about them.
They're not gonna hurt you.

483
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:47,265
What in the hell
is going on out here?

484
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:49,301
Get back in your graves!

485
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,223
- Son of a...
- Holy Jesus!

486
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:55,658
- Frank Bannister!
- Go ahead. I'll handle this.

487
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:00,933
What the hell are you doing
in my graveyard?

488
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:03,255
You have been told to stay away!

489
00:33:03,545 --> 00:33:05,297
Sound off like you've got a pair!

490
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:06,738
Yeah, well,
it's a public place, Hiles.

491
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:08,178
I do not like you!

492
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:11,462
You cannot bring your spooks in here
without my permission!

493
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:13,183
Disappear, scumbag!

494
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:26,541
I am not one of your shitty little
emanations, Bannister.

495
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,820
You cannot push spirits around.

496
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:33,023
You are scum! Using spooks to put
the frighteners on people!

497
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:35,341
That makes me physically ill!

498
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,699
We got a lot of lowlifes
around here!

499
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:42,494
And I will provide an armed response
at the first sign of trouble!

500
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,382
They must be contained!

501
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:53,058
Catch you later, Hiles.

502
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:55,659
My tour of duty
runs another 85 years!

503
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:59,734
There's a piece of dirt up here
with your name on it, Bannister!

504
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:02,293
I'm waiting for you,
you little maggot!

505
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:06,301
There were times when people
have accused Ray of being...

506
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:10,580
less than generous,
but I'm sure, deep down...

507
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:14,579
the man possessed a heart of gold
and a generous spirit.

508
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:18,139
It's true.

509
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:20,864
He wouldn't lie.
Not at a time like this.

510
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:22,984
[Ray sobbing]

511
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:28,417
Because God has chosen to call
our brother Ray...

512
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:30,416
from this life to Himself...

513
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:32,655
we commit his body to the ground.

514
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:35,703
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

515
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:36,774
RAY: Jesus, what a waste.

516
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:39,698
- The Lord bless him and keep him.
- It's a goddamn tragedy.

517
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:43,221
The Lord lift up His countenance
upon him and give him peace.

518
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,778
Goodbye, Ray.

519
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:54,458
Sweetheart, don't cry.

520
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:56,539
Oh, shit!

521
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:20,500
Frank!

522
00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:24,504
I know you can hear me.

523
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,621
Get me out of this hole, Bannister.

524
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,460
Frank.

525
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:30,979
- Get me out of this hole, please.
- Hiya, Frank.

526
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:34,497
- Hey, Walt.
- Kind of surprised to see you.

527
00:35:34,945 --> 00:35:37,539
- Here on business, I guess?
- Not exactly.

528
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,980
Bannister, they're gonna
bury me alive in here.

529
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:43,102
I understand you and Lynskey
had a little run-in...

530
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,857
the night before he died.

531
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,705
As a matter of fact,
apart from his wife...

532
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:50,743
I believe you were the last person
to see him alive.

533
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:53,817
It sounds like you're the one
who's here on business, Walt.

534
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:58,296
No. The FBI is very
concerned about these deaths.

535
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:02,495
They look like heart attacks but
when they slice these people open...

536
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:05,861
their arteries are just
clean as a whistle.

537
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:09,339
But there's been this tremendous
pressure on the heart...

538
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:12,542
like the life has just been
crushed right out of it.

539
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:16,097
- You got any theories, Frank?
- Bannister!

540
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:22,175
Mind if I pay my last respects
before they fill him in?

541
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,857
No. I'm sorry.

542
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:31,539
Bannister, please.

543
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:48,057
I need to be cheered up.

544
00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:49,658
Mr. Bannister?

545
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:54,145
Mr. Bannister,
did you want to see me?

546
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:57,019
Oh, my God, Frank. She can see me.

547
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:03,542
I thought perhaps
you might have a message from Ray.

548
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:07,097
Tell her. Tell her I'm here, Frank.
Tell her.

549
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,420
I mean, everyone says
that you're a fraud...

550
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:11,302
but I've seen what you can do.

551
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,254
Frank!

552
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:19,941
You must think I'm very stupid.

553
00:37:20,225 --> 00:37:21,499
Excuse me.

554
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,019
Lucy...

555
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,855
Ray says he loves you very much.

556
00:37:38,745 --> 00:37:40,861
Here you are. Here's your table.

557
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:43,257
- Hi.
- Hi.

558
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:49,541
Is Ray with us?

559
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:52,700
Yeah.

560
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:55,021
Tell her she looks great.

561
00:37:55,665 --> 00:37:59,135
He says that you look great.

562
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:08,383
- Tell her they're from me.
- Those are from Ray.

563
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:11,098
It's our anniversary.

564
00:38:11,185 --> 00:38:13,301
Right. He says
it's your anniversary.

565
00:38:13,985 --> 00:38:16,579
Is Ray beside me?

566
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:21,258
He's over here.

567
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:25,065
Greetings. How are you this evening?

568
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:27,857
May I offer you some wine?

569
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:31,415
I don't know. Lucy,
do you want some, what, red, white?

570
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:33,616
Red, we always have red.

571
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,385
White. I've never been fond of red.

572
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:38,425
Lucy!

573
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,855
So you used to be an architect?

574
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,017
- A long time ago.
- Can it, Bannister.

575
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:48,823
She doesn't want
to hear your life story.

576
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,499
Wow. So did you
build your own house?

577
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:54,181
I mean, you must have a dream home.

578
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,414
You could call it a dream home.

579
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,177
I'm gonna build you
a dream home, sweetheart...

580
00:38:57,265 --> 00:38:58,778
just as soon as I get on my feet.

581
00:38:58,865 --> 00:38:59,854
Yeah.

582
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:03,376
Tell me, why is it that
you can see Ray and I can't?

583
00:39:04,705 --> 00:39:07,173
I was in an accident,
a car accident...

584
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,464
about five years ago.

585
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,101
I don't know. They say that...

586
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:19,734
sometimes when you have
a traumatic experience...

587
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:22,578
that it can alter your perception.

588
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:26,257
Really, so after that
you could just see spirits?

589
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:28,097
I mean, what happened?

590
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:33,894
How about you talk to Ray?
That's why I'm here.

591
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:36,499
Finally, I'm in the conversation.
Terrific.

592
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:39,338
Well, actually I do have
an important question...

593
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:40,983
that I have to ask Ray.

594
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:42,698
Well, he can hear you.

595
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:50,220
Ray, I really need to know
where you invested my money...

596
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:55,258
the $16,000 that I had saved.

597
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,539
The attorneys can't seem
to find it anywhere.

598
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:01,185
Shit. I blew it on a bad investment.

599
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,418
But don't tell her that.
I'll think of something.

600
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,742
It's gone, Lucy. It's gone.
He blew it on a bad investment.

601
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:09,178
You asshole!

602
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:11,257
Tell her everything's gonna be okay.

603
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,700
I'm gonna look out for her.
I'm gonna move back into the house.

604
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:16,174
- Tell her that.
- No, that's not a good idea.

605
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:18,221
Bannister, this doesn't concern you.

606
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:20,023
What's Ray saying? What's he saying?

607
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:22,061
He left. Ray left.

608
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:24,579
He said he was sorry,
but he wanted to leave you alone...

609
00:40:24,665 --> 00:40:25,984
let you get on with your life.

610
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:28,056
I swear to God, Bannister,
I'm gonna kill you.

611
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:29,976
I can't believe it, I mean...

612
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:33,262
That's just like Ray to just
take the money and run. I...

613
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:39,022
Ray and I haven't been
honest with each other...

614
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:41,175
in a long time, Mr. Bannister.

615
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:46,465
It wasn't what you would call
a good marriage.

616
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:48,704
You bitch!

617
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:56,700
Lucy, it's gonna be okay.

618
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:59,257
Get your hands off my wife!

619
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:01,904
Goddamn it!

620
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:03,460
Sorry.

621
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:06,577
I can move shit, Bannister.

622
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,542
Man, you better watch your back.

623
00:41:10,105 --> 00:41:12,824
I better clean this up.
I'll be right back.

624
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:35,137
Good food, huh?

625
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:38,900
Yeah, it's great.

626
00:43:03,785 --> 00:43:04,854
Mum!

627
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:33,864
Looks like another heart attack...

628
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,220
but I can't confirm it
till the autopsy.

629
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:37,420
Damn.

630
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,221
The waiter says he saw this guy
coming out of the john...

631
00:43:40,305 --> 00:43:42,341
about five minutes
before the body was found.

632
00:43:42,425 --> 00:43:45,019
- And who might that have been?
- Frank Bannister.

633
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:46,823
He was as white as a sheet
and shaking.

634
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:49,214
- Waiter thought he'd been sick.
- Damn.

635
00:43:50,945 --> 00:43:52,537
- Hi, Lucy.
- Lucy?

636
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,334
No.

637
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:56,575
Dr. Lynskey works for me.
We're colleagues.

638
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:59,418
Look, Doc, she's a material witness,
all right?

639
00:44:04,265 --> 00:44:05,300
Okay.

640
00:44:07,385 --> 00:44:10,775
Walt, Bannister was last seen
in the restaurant parking lot.

641
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:12,896
He took off at high speed.

642
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,054
Bring him in.

643
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:25,619
Look at that.

644
00:44:56,545 --> 00:45:00,902
So your dead husband was having
dinner with you at the restaurant?

645
00:45:03,905 --> 00:45:05,224
What did he order?

646
00:45:11,185 --> 00:45:13,096
Oh, God. Excuse me.

647
00:45:13,665 --> 00:45:14,780
Timmy.

648
00:45:28,545 --> 00:45:30,775
Timmy, front desk, please.

649
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:33,220
Thank you.

650
00:45:33,585 --> 00:45:37,180
Lucy, this is Special Agent
Milton Dammers of the FBI.

651
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:45,778
I came by train.

652
00:45:45,905 --> 00:45:49,295
I was going to take the flight but
I didn't feel good about the plane.

653
00:45:49,385 --> 00:45:51,979
At what time precisely...

654
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:55,141
did Bannister leave
for the bathroom?

655
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:57,334
You.

656
00:45:58,585 --> 00:46:01,224
I'm not sure, precisely.

657
00:46:02,305 --> 00:46:04,739
Did he use excessive amounts
of table salt during his meal?

658
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,736
- What?
- Answer the question.

659
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:09,260
For Christ's sakes,
it's really late.

660
00:46:09,345 --> 00:46:11,256
I can't remember that, okay?

661
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:18,179
Oh, God. What is this?

662
00:46:18,705 --> 00:46:21,139
Excuse me, Lucy, I'll be right back.

663
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:27,014
Milton?

664
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:31,138
Sorry, Sheriff.

665
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:34,381
I have a problem with women yelling.

666
00:46:34,665 --> 00:46:36,576
Milton, can I get you anything?

667
00:46:37,305 --> 00:46:38,499
Sheriff Perry!

668
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,735
You are violating
my territorial bubble.

669
00:46:52,545 --> 00:46:54,263
Lucy, you're still grieving.

670
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:58,580
It would be very easy for a man like
Frank Bannister to take advantage.

671
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:02,015
You have such closed minds.
I can't believe it.

672
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:03,333
I object.

673
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:07,861
Special Agent Dammers...

674
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:10,664
has over 20 years experience
in the area...

675
00:47:11,985 --> 00:47:13,816
of paranormal psychology.

676
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:17,496
Much of that was spent undercover
with various...

677
00:47:18,785 --> 00:47:20,298
cults and sects.

678
00:47:20,825 --> 00:47:23,897
I get all the fruity cases,
Mrs. Lynskey.

679
00:47:24,785 --> 00:47:27,424
For God's sake, Milton,
would you come inside and sit down?

680
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:29,097
I'm more comfortable standing.
Thank you.

681
00:47:29,185 --> 00:47:31,460
I really don't see what this
has to do with Frank Bannister.

682
00:47:31,545 --> 00:47:34,821
Mrs. Lynskey, you know nothing
about Frank Bannister.

683
00:47:34,905 --> 00:47:37,055
You claim
he's a bona fide psychic...

684
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,535
yet all I've heard is a lot of
ill-informed, meandering waffle.

685
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,655
On the third day of July 1990...

686
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:47,895
Frank Bannister,
then a successful architect...

687
00:47:47,985 --> 00:47:50,545
was overseeing the construction
of his new home.

688
00:47:51,985 --> 00:47:55,773
Now, the building contractor,
Jacob Platz, would later confirm...

689
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:58,902
that Bannister had been
consuming alcohol that morning.

690
00:47:59,385 --> 00:48:03,503
12:23 p.m., Platz sees Bannister...

691
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:06,338
<i>in a heated argument</i>
<i>with his wife, Debra.</i>

692
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,064
It appears that Bannister
had promised Debra a garden...

693
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:10,419
in the new home...

694
00:48:10,505 --> 00:48:12,973
<i>and then, without consulting her,</i>
<i>proceeded to lay...</i>

695
00:48:13,065 --> 00:48:15,135
<i>a four-inch thick concrete slab...</i>

696
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,500
creating a basketball court
for himself.

697
00:48:19,465 --> 00:48:21,535
12:31 p. M...

698
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:24,742
<i>Platz watches the couple drive away.</i>

699
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:30,501
Bannister kept a tool box
in the back of his car.

700
00:48:31,305 --> 00:48:34,502
And in it was a utility knife
with a retractable blade.

701
00:48:35,185 --> 00:48:39,576
Bannister purchased
seven new blades...

702
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:41,703
that morning...

703
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:45,218
at Jesson's Hardware
Store and Building Supply...

704
00:48:45,945 --> 00:48:48,937
on the corner of 3rd and Garrett.
3rd and Garrett.

705
00:48:49,065 --> 00:48:50,384
Third of July.

706
00:48:50,905 --> 00:48:53,055
Seven blades. Three.

707
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:54,540
Milton...

708
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:58,015
you're mumbling. We can't understand
a word you're saying.

709
00:48:58,105 --> 00:48:59,458
12:33 p. M...

710
00:49:00,585 --> 00:49:03,816
<i>and their '84 Volvo</i>
<i>heads into the hills.</i>

711
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:07,136
It is the last time anyone
will see the couple together.

712
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:11,615
Now, by Bannister's own admission,
the argument continues to rage...

713
00:49:11,705 --> 00:49:14,344
reaching a climactic point when
Debra demands that Bannister stop...

714
00:49:14,425 --> 00:49:15,778
<i>pull over, let her out.</i>

715
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:18,982
And at that moment,
probably 12:36, 12:37 p. M...

716
00:49:19,065 --> 00:49:21,898
the car leaves the road
on a sharp curve...

717
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:26,379
presumably because Bannister
was driving too fast.

718
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:29,304
She was killed?

719
00:49:32,225 --> 00:49:34,978
Her body was found
some 15 yards from the car.

720
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,624
Now, Bannister...

721
00:49:36,905 --> 00:49:40,420
he was picked up two hours later,
wandering in the woods.

722
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:44,021
He claimed to have no recollection
of the events that occurred...

723
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:45,618
after the accident.

724
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:48,905
But here's the odd thing,
Mrs. Lynskey.

725
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:52,860
His utility knife was missing.

726
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:57,934
And to this day
it has not been found.

727
00:49:59,425 --> 00:50:02,305
But do you know
what was really bizarre?

728
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:07,305
Debra's corpse had the number 13...

729
00:50:07,585 --> 00:50:09,505
carved into its forehead.

730
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:13,345
Unlucky for some.

731
00:50:19,145 --> 00:50:21,295
Come on. You're out of your mind.

732
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,137
You're talking
about a mythical figure.

733
00:50:23,225 --> 00:50:26,103
A pseudo-religious icon
from the 12th century.

734
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:31,022
Save your pea brain prattle
for the classroom, boy.

735
00:50:31,785 --> 00:50:34,743
That was the soul collector...

736
00:50:35,385 --> 00:50:39,776
and he's been taking people out
since time began.

737
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:44,464
He's going about some dark business
here in Fairwater...

738
00:50:44,865 --> 00:50:47,299
and we ain't nothing but worm bait.

739
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:52,140
When your number's up, that's it.

740
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,301
There's another one gone.

741
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:53,264
He's gone.

742
00:51:53,705 --> 00:51:56,299
There's no money for you here,
Mr. Bannister.

743
00:51:58,145 --> 00:51:59,339
You're next.

744
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:01,583
Are you threatening me?

745
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:03,941
No, that's not what I'm saying.

746
00:52:04,025 --> 00:52:06,414
- He's threatening to kill me.
- Just relax, all right?

747
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:08,621
- Just listen to me and...
- He's threatening to kill me.

748
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:10,536
- Bannister!
- Great.

749
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:12,184
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

750
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:13,774
What are you doing?

751
00:52:13,865 --> 00:52:15,378
Excuse me.

752
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,183
- Put the gun away, all right?
- Freeze.

753
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:19,495
All right, everybody,
just take it easy.

754
00:52:31,105 --> 00:52:33,300
Just stay there, Bannister.
Just stay there.

755
00:52:38,065 --> 00:52:39,054
Yes.

756
00:52:46,545 --> 00:52:47,534
Great.

757
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:48,819
I did it.

758
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:50,694
Judge.

759
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:52,139
Bannister, stop.

760
00:52:52,225 --> 00:52:56,059
Looks like I ain't shooting
with blanks no more.

761
00:52:59,745 --> 00:53:01,337
Mighty fine woman.

762
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:03,178
Good teeth.

763
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:05,699
- Now put your hands on the podium.
- Judge.

764
00:53:05,785 --> 00:53:06,900
Stay down!

765
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:11,016
They don't call me the hanging judge
for nothing.

766
00:53:16,865 --> 00:53:18,423
Stay right there.

767
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:23,860
Heads up.

768
00:53:24,465 --> 00:53:25,580
Good catch.

769
00:53:31,065 --> 00:53:32,464
[People screaming]

770
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:48,054
Freeze!

771
00:53:53,425 --> 00:53:55,017
Good shooting, Tex.

772
00:53:57,545 --> 00:53:59,854
And she was so young and beautiful!

773
00:54:13,945 --> 00:54:17,096
I like it
when they lie still like that.

774
00:54:23,145 --> 00:54:24,498
This is heavy.

775
00:54:29,905 --> 00:54:32,465

Gotta go.

781
00:54:51,985 --> 00:54:53,862
- Bannister!
- Stop.

782
00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:22,102
Damn. Come on.

783
00:55:45,665 --> 00:55:47,940
Just get down.
Get down and stay down.

Oh, no.

Oh, no.

You killed me, you bastard!

You're sick.
Is this how you get your kicks?

Did it feel good killing me?

794
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:21,055

your wife?

I seriously doubt we will see
Mr. Bannister any time soon.

00:57:56,025 --> 00:57:59,700
I've come to report
that Magda Rees-Jones'...

Frank, did you have anything to do
with her death?

806
00:58:13,705 --> 00:58:14,820
Frank!

807
00:58:15,305 --> 00:58:18,183
Frank, are you okay? What happened?

808
00:58:19,585 --> 00:58:21,257
What are you doing?

809

- Are you arresting him?
- Please leave, Mrs. Lynskey.

Look, baby, you know
we have a great relationship.

828

It's just that...

01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:19,097
to get the hell out of this room.

843
01:00:52,265 --> 01:00:54,381
Have you ever heard
of Nina Kulagina?

844
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:59,214
March 10, 1970. Nina Kulagina
with the power of her mind...

845
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:01,455
stopped the beat of a frog's heart.

846
01:01:01,905 --> 01:01:04,783
The record of this experiment
is currently held...

847
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:07,857
in the files
of Prof. Gennady Sergeyev...

848
01:01:08,545 --> 01:01:09,978
of Saint Petersburg.

849
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:13,860
And as Sergeyev
interpreted this cardiogram...

850
01:01:13,945 --> 01:01:15,742
it seemed to him
that the heart had experienced...

851
01:01:15,825 --> 01:01:17,338
a sudden flare-up
of electrical activity.

852
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:19,381
The heart imploded,
the arteries burst...

853
01:01:19,465 --> 01:01:22,935
and all because Nina Kulagina
wanted the animal dead.

854
01:01:27,345 --> 01:01:28,778
I don't kill people.

There's a part of you
that believes that.

856
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:39,375
There's another part of you,
Frank...

857
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,297
that's out of control.

858

I've seen a figure in a cape.

860
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:54,264
I've seen him reach into people's
chests and squeeze their hearts.

861
01:01:56,305 --> 01:01:57,624
Who was it?

862

Who was it?

I can't understand it.

don't you, Mr. Bannister?

But in my business, I deal with
your type every other week.

This Death figure...

870
01:02:33,185 --> 01:02:36,495
is nothing more
than a homicidal alter ego...

871
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:39,258
that satisfies
your compulsion to kill.

872
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:40,334
No.

of absolving yourself of guilt.

No!

spirits, Frank? After Debra's death?

That's eight clear of Gacy.

Another nine and we'll
have broken Bundy's record.

Frank!

1271
01:44:40,465 --> 01:44:43,377
Please, please don't hurt me. Stop.

1272
01:44:47,305 --> 01:44:48,897
[Patricia laughing]

1273
01:44:58,425 --> 01:44:59,540
Please.

1274
01:45:00,505 --> 01:45:02,097
[Patricia giggling excitedly]

1275
01:45:16,985 --> 01:45:18,100
Frank!

1276
01:45:19,465 --> 01:45:21,465
Oh, my God. Frank.

1277
01:45:36,225 --> 01:45:37,345
Debra.

1278
01:45:57,505 --> 01:45:58,745
You killed her.

1279
01:46:02,305 --> 01:46:04,105
You're next, pal.

1280
01:46:07,425 --> 01:46:08,865
Take him out, baby.

1281
01:46:19,225 --> 01:46:20,783
No! Get him!

1282
01:46:20,905 --> 01:46:22,304
[Frank screams in pain]

1283
01:46:22,385 --> 01:46:23,898
No! Stop!

1284
01:46:27,025 --> 01:46:28,140
Frank!

1285
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:32,454
No!

1286
01:46:36,065 --> 01:46:37,544
Get him, Patty.

1287
01:46:40,065 --> 01:46:41,100
Yeah, baby.

1288
01:47:01,905 --> 01:47:04,055
Baby, you are an artist.

1289
01:47:05,905 --> 01:47:07,623
- You're pretty, too.
- No!

1290
01:47:13,105 --> 01:47:14,094
No.

1291
01:47:19,065 --> 01:47:20,100
Yes.

1292
01:47:29,865 --> 01:47:32,299
I'm in the mood
for a little vivisection.

1293
01:47:32,385 --> 01:47:33,454
No!

1294
01:47:34,065 --> 01:47:35,265
Me, too.

1295
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:43,025
You bitch!

1296
01:47:43,105 --> 01:47:44,945
No!

1297
01:47:49,265 --> 01:47:51,145
I got your girlfriend, Johnny!

1298
01:47:52,065 --> 01:47:55,425
- Come and get her!
- No, goddamn you! Let go of her!

1299
01:47:55,505 --> 01:47:57,065
- Johnny!
- Come and get her, you coward!

1300
01:47:57,145 --> 01:47:59,215
- Come on and get her!
- No!

1301
01:47:59,625 --> 01:48:01,065
Let go of my Patty!

1302
01:48:04,745 --> 01:48:05,860
Patty!

1303
01:48:08,305 --> 01:48:09,704
[Patricia screaming]

1304
01:48:12,145 --> 01:48:13,185
Johnny!

1305
01:48:26,385 --> 01:48:28,182
Come here. Give me your hand.

1306
01:48:35,385 --> 01:48:38,218
See you later, Frank. We got you.

1307
01:48:39,185 --> 01:48:41,824
We're going back down
to get us some more!

1308
01:48:42,465 --> 01:48:43,784
Yo, Frank.

1309
01:48:46,545 --> 01:48:47,825
How's it going?

1310
01:48:50,865 --> 01:48:51,980
Bye, Frank.

1311
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:56,774
Johnny.

1312
01:48:58,225 --> 01:48:59,340
- Step back, Frank.
- Yeah.

1313
01:48:59,425 --> 01:49:01,381
This isn't going to be pleasant.

1314
01:49:08,705 --> 01:49:10,263
[Both screaming in anguish]

1315
01:49:31,865 --> 01:49:35,653
The old express bus to hell.
No lines, no waiting.

1316
01:49:46,105 --> 01:49:48,061
STUART: It's really something, isn't it?

1317
01:49:48,185 --> 01:49:49,905
Excellent libraries.

1318
01:49:50,305 --> 01:49:51,785
Premium cigars.

1319
01:49:52,305 --> 01:49:55,422
And of course, the honeys.

1320
01:49:55,825 --> 01:49:59,261
Yeah, how about that? Stu's
a regular chick magnet up here.

1321
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:06,380
Hello, Frank.

1322
01:50:08,945 --> 01:50:10,663
It's time to go home.

1323
01:50:11,865 --> 01:50:13,014
I am home.

1324
01:50:13,665 --> 01:50:14,780
[Stuart and Cyrus exclaim]

1325
01:50:14,865 --> 01:50:15,900
No.

1326
01:50:16,025 --> 01:50:18,334
You see,
the authorities have informed us...

1327
01:50:18,425 --> 01:50:20,541
that it's just not your time.

1328
01:50:22,145 --> 01:50:23,624
Start living, dude.

1329
01:50:29,745 --> 01:50:31,019
Be happy.

1330
01:50:47,145 --> 01:50:48,260
Frank!

1331
01:51:25,745 --> 01:51:27,417
There's something
I have to tell you.

1332
01:51:27,505 --> 01:51:28,574
Yeah?

1333
01:51:36,305 --> 01:51:39,217
- Sorry to interrupt you, folks.
- It's all right, Walt.

1334
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:45,185
Frank, what do you know
about Ouija boards?

1335
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:46,334
Not a lot.

1336
01:51:46,505 --> 01:51:49,019
I found a whole stack of them
up at the Bradley house.

1337
01:51:49,105 --> 01:51:51,824
It looks like Patricia
just got herself a direct line...

1338
01:51:51,905 --> 01:51:54,817
to her dead boyfriend as soon
as she was released five years ago.

1339
01:51:54,905 --> 01:51:56,463
It seems like the old lady...

1340
01:51:56,545 --> 01:51:59,013
when she got wind
of Patricia's involvement...

1341
01:52:00,945 --> 01:52:04,620
in your wife's death,
then she just kept the girl sedated.

1342
01:52:04,945 --> 01:52:07,175
She just couldn't stop
Bartlett, though.

1343
01:52:07,265 --> 01:52:09,859
Nice epilogue, Walt.
It was well delivered.

1344
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:12,294
Frank.

1345
01:52:14,025 --> 01:52:16,016
Just one other little thing.

1346
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:19,336
I got a whole bucket load
of vacation time coming to me...

1347
01:52:19,425 --> 01:52:21,416
and I thought you and I...

1348
01:52:21,505 --> 01:52:24,099
could collaborate on a book
about all this.

1349
01:52:24,185 --> 01:52:25,937
It could be my ticket off the force.

1350
01:52:26,025 --> 01:52:27,253
That's not really my area.

1351
01:52:27,345 --> 01:52:28,698
If you're looking
for a collaborator...

1352
01:52:28,785 --> 01:52:31,060
how about your guardian angel
over there?

1353
01:52:38,705 --> 01:52:41,173
- You got me, Frank.
- I got you, Walt.

1354
01:52:44,945 --> 01:52:47,505
I'll see you, Frank. Bye-bye.

1355
01:52:51,945 --> 01:52:54,140
Boy, that Dammers,
he sure looks pissed.

1356
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:55,214
Yeah.

1357
01:52:57,865 --> 01:52:59,378
Well, sometimes, Frank, you see...

1358
01:52:59,465 --> 01:53:01,421
when you go through
a traumatic experience...

1359
01:53:01,505 --> 01:53:03,223
it kind of alters your perception.

1360
01:53:05,785 --> 01:53:06,900
No.

1361
01:53:12,665 --> 01:53:14,781
