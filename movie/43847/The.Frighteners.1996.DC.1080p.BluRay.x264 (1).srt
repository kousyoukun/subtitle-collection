00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,758
令30余人丧命的心脏病…

22
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:47,078
几十年来 费尔沃特镇就等于死亡…
"For decades, the name of Fairwater has been synonymous with Death..."

23
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:51,287

"...following the infamous 1964 Bradley-Bartlett murder spree."

24
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:54,761
30年后 镇上死亡人数再度上升…
"Thirty years later as the death toll steadily rises..."

25
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:58,025
看来死神这回再度…

“来到了悠静的费尔沃特镇”

51
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:48,661
我要告死你
'cause I'm gonna sue your ass.

52
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,262
不要告到法庭上嘛
Now let's not get litigious, all right?

53
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,705
寄帐单给我就好
Just send me a bill.

54
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:53,969
“灵媒调查员法兰克班尼斯特”？

最好把我的草皮给翻新
I want this lawn completely resurfaced.

61

所以我帮他代班
and I'm seeing his patients today.

72
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,270
她本来在切蔬菜 不过刀子滑掉了
She was cutting the vegetables and the knife slipped.

73
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:07,942
缝几针应该就不会有大碍
Well, a couple of stitches and she'll be fine.

74
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:09,951
我载你到医院去
I'll drive you to the clinic.

75
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,713
想都别想
That's impossible.

76
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:15,989
她伤口很深 那就给她抗生素
It's a deep cut.Then leave her some antibiotics.

77

Wait, just a minute.

80
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,144
谁这样对待你？
Who did that to you?

81
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:41,509
林斯基医生 你最好快离开
I think you'd better go now, Dr. Lynskey.

82
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,319
你不认识我女儿吧？
You don't know who my daughter is, do you?

83
00:08:50,393 --> 00:08:53,521
绝不能相信派翠亚 什么？
Patricia's not to be trusted. I beg your pardon?

84
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,421
我随时都可以报案检举她
I can have her locked up anytime I want to.

85
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:04,472
他们说她是帮凶

86

I know the truth.

87
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:11,641
发生的是冷血谋杀案

血淋淋的27分钟内…

病人、医护人员、访客…
Patients, medical staff, visitors,

92
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:44,169
没人逃过费尔沃特疗养院杀人魔…
no one was spared in this madman's rampage

93
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,340
无情的暴行
through Fairwater Sanatorium.

94
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:49,782
就连医院的小教堂都成了命案现场…
Not even the hospital chapel provided sanctuary

95
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:52,753
当时在祈祷的民众也难逃一劫
as those in prayer were gunned down on their knees.

96
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:53,880
拜托一下！
For heaven sakes!

一宗看来不合逻辑的犯罪案

00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:02,353
巴特利杀人的动机 至今仍是一团谜

101
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:05,757
他看起来就像魔鬼

102
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:07,860
能跟你说几句吗？　待会儿

106
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,542
6年前 查尔斯史达魏德…

111
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:31,416
被控为本谋杀案帮凶

113
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,354
是她
That's her.

114
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:40,999
我今天下午去了她家
I was in her house this afternoon.

115
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:44,666
杀人狂与精神变态者

116
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,037
宝贝 太好了
honey.Great

117
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:47,541
我们才搬到这儿3个月…
We've been in town for three months

118
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,443
你就已经跟杀人狂做朋友了
and you're making friends with the Manson Family.

119
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:54,915
2千2百伏特的电流…
2,200 volts of electricity

将毫无悔意的杀人魔强尼巴特利置于死地

121
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:01,248
电椅启动时 他尖叫说…
As they threw the switch he was heard to scream:

122
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:04,157
“我得了12分 谁也比不过”
"I got me a score of 12. Beat that."

123
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:11,425
许多人都觉得派翠亚安布莱德利…
In what some considered a miscarriage of justice

124
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,333
当初被判终生监禁并不公平…
Patricia Ann Bradley was sentenced to life imprisonment

125
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:17,395
因为从未有法律判决证实她真有涉嫌…
although it was never proven that she actively participated

126
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:19,031
这桩谋杀案
in the killings.

127
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:23,067
5年前 州长有条件释放…
Five years ago, Patricia Bradley was granted a conditional release

128
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:24,939
派翠亚布莱德利

129
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:29,417
如今她回到老家 过着隐居的生活…
Today she lives a reclusive life back in the family home...

130
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:33,021
电巴特利的时候 也该把她给电死
Should've fried her when they fried Bartlett.

131
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:35,251
她当年才15岁耶
She was 15 years old, you know.

132
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,622
只不过是爱错了人
She just fell in love with the wrong guy.

133
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:39,024
谁都可能犯这种错
It could happen to anyone.

134
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:41,427
宝贝 别再去那里
Sweetie, I don't want you going back up there.

135
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:43,658
那地方让我觉得很不舒服
The place gives me the creeps.

136
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,099
我觉得你真的没必要…
I really don't think that you should...

137
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:50,934
拜托一下嘛
Come on, honey.

138
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,106
我好像有点寂寞喔
I think Tiger's getting a little lonely.

139
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:00,381
猜我今晚做了什么？
Guess what I did tonight, honey.

140
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:03,441
我在石中剑餐厅订了位
I made reservations at Excalibur's.

141
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:08,980
宝贝 你不记得了？
Don't you remember, sweetheart?

142
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:11,318
这个星期二是我们的周年纪念
It's our anniversary this Tuesday.

143
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:13,294
我还订了我们最喜欢的位置
I even got our favorite table.

144
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,557
不错吧 小呆呆？
Yeah? You silly willy?

145
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,073
这怎么会在这儿？
What the hell is this doing here?

146
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:37,418
我明明就撕掉了
I thought I tore this up.

147
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:39,647
他有回到家里来吗？　谁？
Did he come back to the house? Who?

148
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:41,246
把我们围篱撞烂了的那个蠢蛋！
That moron that tore up my fence!

149
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,827
救救我啊！雷 救救我！
Help! Ray, help.

150
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,234
他是活的
He's alive.

151
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:56,669
雷！
Ray!

152
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,730
雷 救我下来！
Ray, get me off!

153
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:20,789
你这个变态！
You sick thing!

154
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:38,903
露西 我不要那骗子上门
Lucy, I don't want that con man in my house.

155
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:45,243
一定有什么合理的解释吧
There's gotta be some kind of rational explanation for all this.

156
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,916
我可不想听那个通灵蠢蛋的话
I just don't want some goddamn spoon bender telling me what to do.

157
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:53,118
雷 我们家里有捣蛋鬼！
Ray, we have got a poltergeist!

158
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:56,125
警察一定能够摆平
Well, it's nothing that the police can't handle.

159
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:04,336
我是班尼斯特
Bannister.

160
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:07,934
林斯基医生 我马上过去
Dr. Lynskey, I'm on my way.

161
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,046
灵魂到访过的痕迹 每年这时都有这种问题
Ah! Persistent residue of the departed.Always a problem this time of year.

162
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:22,215
林斯基医生？
Dr. Lynskey?

163
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,657
- 谢谢你抽空过来
- 这…　　　　　
-Ah, yes. Thank you for coming. -Yeah.

164
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:28,125
问题到底出在哪里？
The activity is currently located where?

165
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:31,792
嗯 我也不知道 5分钟前才安静下来
Well, I don't know. It just went quiet about five minutes ago.

166
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,764
安静下来？
Went quiet?

167
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,135
餐桌是不是以逆时钟方向转？
The dining room table spun in a counterclockwise direction?

168
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:41,207
好像没有吧
I don't think that that one happened. No.

169
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,275
马桶盖有没有上下翻动？
The toilet seat lid banged up and down?

170
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:46,644
没有
No.

171
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:50,207
- 床有没有飞起来？
- 有我当时还在床上
-Did the bed levitate? -Yeah, with me on it.

172
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,456
无意识的意志力 喔 天哪
Spontaneous recurrent psychokinesis. Oh, boy.

173
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:58,152
这可能是我看过最糟的一件案子
This could be the worst case I've ever seen.

174
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:00,092
真的很糟糕
Yeah, this is bad.

175
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:03,856
好 各位 我可以帮你们赶鬼…
Okay. Well, folks, I can do a clearance

176
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,197
不过费用可能会有点贵
but it's not gonna be cheap.

177
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,503
不过我可以提供6个月的保证
Although I do offer a six-month guarantee.

178
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,095
多少？
How much?

179
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:12,572
249元9毛5
$249.95.

180
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:16,839
不过午夜后的服务费用要再追加三成
But there is a 30% surcharge for making a house call after midnight.

181
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:18,843
还有车费、油资…
Then there's vehicle, gas,

182
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:21,007
所以总共的花费…
so I'd say the whole thing is gonna set you back

183
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,109
大约是450元
somewhere in the neighborhood of $450.

184
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:31,120
不过可用你们前院的围篱来做抵销
Although we could forget about the fence,call the whole thing even.

185
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:32,885
快点
Do it.

186
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,399
好 不好意思 小姐 请后退一点
Okay. Excuse me, ma'am. You wanna stand back.

187
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,662
不想让你签弃权证书
I don't want you to have to sign a waiver.

188
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:43,296
外加1百元的材料费 我不能贴自己的钱吧
Plus a $100 for materials. I can't be out of pocket.

189
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,068
班尼斯特 动作快一点
Just do it, for Christ's sakes, Bannister.

190
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:48,633
好了
Here we go.

191
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:52,714
好
All righty.

192
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:56,751
为什么是我们？他们为什么在我们家？
Why us? I mean, why are they in our house?

193
00:15:56,986 --> 00:16:00,217
虽然鬼魂通常都在墓园里…
All I can tell you is emanations are normally confined to the cemetery

194
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:01,620
不过他们会逃跑
although they do escape.

195
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,317
通常都是年轻的鬼魂
It's usually the young ones.

196
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,587
拜托你 班尼斯特
For God's sakes, Bannister, come on.

197
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,721
快一点
Come on.

198
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,831
这是圣水
It's Holy water.

199
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:32,149
这简直是狗屁 根本就是狗屁
This is bullshit. This is total bullshit.

200
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:36,522
快点 太好了！
Come on. Yes!

201
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,155
这些是你们的
Okay, these belong to you.

202
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:44,699
抓到6个鬼魂
Six ectoplasmic emanations.

203
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,361
别担心 他们不会逃走
Don't worry. They can't escape.

204
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:50,064
有些人喜欢纪念品 想要我放在哪儿？
Some people like a souvenir. Where would you like me to put them?

205
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,972
不了 我们不需要留下做纪念
No. I really don't think we wanna hang onto those.

206
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,634
谢谢你
So, thank you.

207
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:57,368
- 需要吗？　
- 我才懒得管
-Do we, hon? -I could give a rat's ass.

208
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,514
好
Okay.

209
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:06,754
别担心 他们没知觉
Don't worry, they can't feel a thing.

210
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:09,222
起码书上是这样写
At least that's what it says in the book.

211
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:11,759
不过也不是绝对的
You never really know for sure.

212
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:15,552
好 谢谢你 班尼斯特 你可以走了
All right. Thank you, Bannister.You can go.

213
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:21,694
你在看什么看？
What the hell are you staring at?

214
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:25,701
怎么会有号码？
What's with the number?

215
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,503
什么号码？
What number?

216
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:32,739
要是你想吓我 一点用也没有
Look, if you're trying to freak me out, it's not gonna work, okay?

217
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:34,043
你知道他想干嘛吗？
You know what he's trying to do?

218
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:36,880
他只想骗我们的钱
He's trying to get more money out of us is what he's trying to do.

219
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:40,012
快点把你的东西拿走 给我滚出去
Here, take your shit and get the hell out of my house.

220
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,613
快点
Come on.

221
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:44,323
- 快点　
- 雷你…
-Move. -Ray, just...

222
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:47,591
真是谢谢你
Thank you so much.

223
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:55,131
- 拿去吧
- 谢了　
-There you go. -Thanks.

224
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:56,796
谢谢你
Thank you.

225
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:00,474
你干嘛每次都这样对别人？
Why do you always have to alienate everybody?

226
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,269
我好像要吐了
I think I'm going to throw up.

227
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,195
糟糕
Damn.

228
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:54,689
老兄 那车厢有够烂！
Man, I hate that trunk!

229
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:57,288
我知道 我可不想让你们…
Yeah, I don't want you guys spreading your ectoplasmic muck

230
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,526
把我的车弄脏
all over my car seats.

231
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,433
真是太为难你了 要不是因为我们…
The ectoplasm's the only thing sticky enough to hold

232
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,902
你的车早就散了
the damn car together.

233
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:06,202
　　　　　　　　　　　　
法兰克我知道你的车很烂…
Look, Frank, I'm sorry about your pus yellow, piece-of-shit Volvo

234
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:09,369
不过我们拒绝坐在车厢里 听到了没？
but we ain't riding in the damn trunk no more, you understand?

235
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:12,608
我们想时髦一点
We would like to cruise with some style, man.

236
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:14,740
你们今晚根本没帮我
You know, you guys left me high and dry tonight.

237
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:17,183
我到他们家的时候 什么事也没发生
I get to the house, nothing's happening.

238
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:18,913
不可思议
I couldn't believe it.

239
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:22,550
史都华 你到底想怎样？
Stuart, in or out?

240
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:26,226
你们连马桶盖都没碰？
You guys didn't even bang the toilet seat lid?

241
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,762
让我糗死了
You made me look like an asshole.

242
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,958
法兰克 我们抬床的时候 还扭到腰
We strained our backs lifting that heavy ass bed, Frank.

243
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,163
还有 是哪个白痴…
Yeah. Who was the idiot

244
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:35,635
在他的头上写数字？
who put the number in the guy's forehead?

245
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:39,371
一点也不好笑
It wasn't funny.

246
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,465
快点做工…
Start pulling your weight, guys

247
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:43,067
不然就送你们回墓园
or you're going back to the cemetery.

248
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,409
法兰克 你最好想一想
Yeah, well, you can pull this, Frank.

249
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,915
我准备要跟你算帐
I'm about to go like Jesse on your ass.

250
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:49,712
我要去找其他的黑人鬼魂…
I'm gonna find me some other black

251
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:51,719
然后举办一场大游行
ghosts and then organize a march.

252
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:54,722
非裔美籍幽灵联盟
The African American Apparition Coalition.

253
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,324
简称非美幽盟
The AAAC.

254
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:57,983
法兰克 你给我听好！
And I'm gonna tell you something, Frank!

255
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,722
一群不爽的死黑人…
There ain't nothing worse than a bunch of pissed off brothers

256
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,661
是很恐怖的！
that's already dead!

257
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,999
可以帮我一下吗？
Will someone help me, please?

258
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:09,634
史都华 放轻松一点 我是说真的
Stu, man, you gotta loosen up, man. I'm serious.

259
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:12,299
来 放轻松
Come on. Looser,

260
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:14,705
放轻松点 听到没？
just loosen up, okay? You lose? All right.

261
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:19,947
神经不要那么紧绷嘛
You're so tight you can play "Pick up sticks" with your butt cheeks.

262
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:25,518
放轻松 让自己变成微粒物体
Loosen up. There you go.

263
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:27,378
哇靠
Damn!

264
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:32,258
他根本就在占我们的便宜
That fellow takes us totally for granted.

265
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,695
我们应该是他的工作同仁
And we're supposed to be his business partners.

266
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:41,066
搞什么嘛 我明早一定要修理他一顿
What a joke!I'm gonna straighten him out. First thing in the morning.

267
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,568
我可是双学位的高材生
He's dealing with a double major here.

268
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:47,336
我不再当好好先生了 一定要给他颜色瞧瞧
Well, no more Mr. nice guy.I'm gonna get rough!

269
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:49,807
- 史都华你在跟我说话吗？
- 不是　　　　　　　　　
-You talking to me, Stuart?  -No.

270
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:52,847
史都华 那是你的问题 你对他太好了
See, Stuart, that's your problem. You're too soft with him.

271
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:56,112
你只要到法兰克面前 看着他的眼睛说…
You gotta just walk up to Frank,just look him in the eye and just say,

272
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:59,313
“法兰克 照我说的做 不然你就死定了！”
Frank, give me what I want or I'm gonna bust your ass!

273
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:22,342
法兰克 你怎样啊？
Yo, Frank! How's it hanging?

274
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:25,136
赛瑞斯 我也不知道 你觉得呢
I don't know, Cyrus. You tell me.

275
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:28,342
老实跟你说 你实在没什么本钱
Well, Frank, I'll tell you.The women ain't missing nothing!

276
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:31,944
我之前就说过了 不要从水管冒出来
Hey, come on. I told you guys,get the hell out of my plumbing.

277
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:34,884
别这样啦
Hey, look, come on, Frank!

278
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:37,755
我们需要开会 我们得好好谈一谈
Look, we want to call a meeting, man. We gotta...

279
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,384
赛瑞斯 我要尿尿…
Hey, Cyrus. I gotta take a leak.

280
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:42,388
我要就地解决了
And I'm not getting out of the shower.

281
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:43,988
再见
Goodbye.

282
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:49,328
所以 快乐的鬼魂就是有出息的鬼魂
Therefore, a happy ghost is a productive ghost.

283
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:53,802
为了达到那境界 我整理出了几项建议
To that end, I've drawn up a list of suggestions.

284
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,271
法兰克 别忘了…
Now bear in mind, Frank

285
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:58,279
我们为你忠心地服务了5年
that we have given you five years of loyal service.

286
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,079
苍蝇 史都华 你们就只会带来苍蝇
Flies. That's what you've given me, Stuart. Flies.

287
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:07,212
为什么苍蝇老是跟着你们跑？
Why is it that flies stick to you guys like shit to a blanket?

288
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,519
法兰克 你真幽默
Ha-ha! Very funny. You a funny guy, Frank.

289
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:11,388
只会为自己着想
You know, all you think about is yourself.

290
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,950
我也想发发牢骚
You know, I can complain, too, you know.

291
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:15,292
我想买新衣服 你一天到晚都穿得很帅
I would like some new clothes. You get to dress nicely.

292
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:17,491
我看起来却俗得要死
I am still looking like Linc from The Mod Squad.

293
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,796
谁叫你70年代就挂了
You died in the '70s. It's a bummer.

294
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:22,336
法兰克 我想赛瑞斯想说的是…
I think what Cyrus is attempting to say, Frank,

295
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:25,339
我们觉得这个企业并没有…
is that we don't feel that the enterprise is evolving

296
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:28,171
照原先的计划来发展
in quite the manner in which we all agree.

297
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:29,471
防虫药
Please don't reach

298
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:31,603
我跟你说话时…
through me when

299
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,808
请不要伸手穿过我身体
I'm trying to speak to you.

300
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,891
法兰克 我们来谈雪茄的事
Now, Frank, we gotta talk about cigars.

301
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:48,054
- 雪茄？
- 没错　
- Cigars? - Damn right.

302
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,223
你明明就答应过我 要送我一盒雪茄
You've been promising a box for I don't know how long.

303
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,631
赛瑞斯 我不想伤你的心 但你作古了
Cyrus, I hate to break this to you but you're dead, you know.

304
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:53,827
不可能抽雪茄
You can't smoke.

305
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:56,769
你还是可以点燃一支 再把烟往我脸上吹啊
Well, you can light them up and blow the smoke in my face.

306
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:59,898
要是我点雪茄 我一定会吐在你脸上
If I light up a cigar, I'll blow my lunch in your face.

307
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,339
大家趴下！法官 该死！
Everybody, get down! Goddamn it, Judge!

308
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:12,020
把枪放下
Put the shooters away.

309
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:22,555
法兰克 他对我头部开枪 置我于死地
That was a head shot, Frank. He could have killed me.

310
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:24,792
要是我想每天被枪击的话…
You know, if I wanted to get shot at every day

311
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:27,300
我早就搬到洛杉矶去了
I'd move my black ass to Los Angeles!

312
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:46,812
当一个人的下巴掉下来时…
When a man's jawbone drops off

313
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:50,617
就应该重新评估局势
it's time to reassess the situation.

314
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:57,496
我帮自己在墓园找到了…
I got myself a nice little grave

315
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,933
一个不错的小地方
up there at the cemetery.

316
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:05,038
我差不多该入土安息了
It could soon be time to lay my bones.

317
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:08,868
法官 你是我的帮手 没你我的生意也别做了
No, you're my go-to guy.Without you, I'm out of business, Judge.

318
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:11,111
吓人…
Frightening,

319
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:14,239
是年轻人的工作 法兰克
that's a young man's game, Frank.

320
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:18,047
我体力不够了
I ain't got no more hauntings left in me.

321
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:20,685
你在胡说什么？你明明就…
What are you talking about? You're in

322
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:22,121
硬朗得很
great shape.

323
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,454
我的关节都快散了
My joints are getting powdery.

324
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,160
我的脸也快散了 我根本就要解体了
The dog's running away with my face.Hell, I'm falling apart.

325
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:32,197
你这么多年来都是如此
You've been falling apart for years.

326
00:24:36,004 --> 00:24:38,495
千万别告诉他们…
Don't go saying nothing to the boys

327
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,706
不过我的鬼魂就快枯干了
but my ectoplasm is all dried up.

328
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:46,439
法官 那真是太遗憾了
I'm sorry to hear that, Judge.

329
00:24:48,183 --> 00:24:50,083
法兰克 省省吧
Give it up, Frank.

330
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:52,313
不能靠死亡这行讨生活啦
Death ain't no way to make a living.

331
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:54,321
法官 我得把这房子修好
Yeah, well, Judge, I gotta finish this house.

332
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:55,981
你不可能把这房子修好
You ain't never gonna finish this house.

333
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:58,457
你什么也做不成！
You ain't never gonna finish nothing!

334
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,722
法兰克 不要再骗自己！
You're fooling yourself, Frank!

335
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:09,129
你惹过太多麻烦了
Too many skeletons in the closet.

336
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:22,549
法兰克 是我们啦
It's us, Frank.

337
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:25,919
你觉得怎样？很恐怖吧？
What do you think? Pretty scary, huh?

338
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:28,555
下次不要再这样了
Don't you ever do that again.

339
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,188
下次或许可以用白床单
Maybe we should try a white sheet next time.

340
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,067
老兄 我听到白这个字就不爽
Ain't gonna be no white sheets, bro.

341
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:46,630
- 赛克早安
- 法兰克　
-Morning, Zach. -Frank.

342
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:55,276
你们想谈一谈 那我们就来谈一谈
Okay. You guys wanna talk, let's talk.

343
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,251
来谈谈这个吧 这是我银行写来的信
Let's talk about this.This is a letter from my bank.

344
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,585
要是付不出1万5 他们就要把这房子卖了
This says they want $15,000 from me or they're gonna sell my house.

345
00:26:01,656 --> 00:26:02,680
不错啊
Well, cool!

346
00:26:02,757 --> 00:26:04,725
我们也该离开这鬼地方…
About time we ditched this drafty ass crib

347
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:07,819
搬到一个有漂亮窗户的新家了
and moved to some place nice with some glass in the windows.

348
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:09,727
赛瑞斯 事态很严重 懂吗？
Hey, Cyrus, this is serious shit, okay?

349
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:12,323
这是我的房子 我才不要让给别人
This is my house. I'm not losing it!

350
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:14,493
史都华
Stuart.

351
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:16,760
史都华 那只鸡一点也不吓人…
The chicken, the chicken was not scary, Stuart.

352
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:18,703
看起来很蠢
The chicken was stupid.

353
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:22,407
法官 帮帮我吧
Judge, help me out here, okay?

354
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:26,004
跟他们谈一谈 他们都很尊敬你 谢了
Talk to these guys. They look up to you, all right? Thanks.

355
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:29,648
各位 我急需1万5千
I need $15,000, guys. I need it quick.

356
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:33,377
该去好好吓人一番了
It is time to get seriously scary.

357
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,680
你看过房子四周吧？
So you checked the place out,

358
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:38,521
　　
对好
-right? -Right.

359
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:41,389
- 里面有几个？
- ５个　　　　
-How many we got in here? -Five.

360
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:43,397
他们绝不会起疑心
They won't suspect a thing.

361
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:45,964
一群呆瓜根本搞不清楚状况
Poor suckers. They won't even know what him 'em.

362
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:48,161
- 有几个出口？
- ２个　　　　
-How many exits? -Two.

363
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:58,836
我们得把握机会 一定要狠点 绝不留情
All right, man, this is it. We gotta be hard. No mercy.

364
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:00,973
我们要跟演员一样专业
We're going in like professionals, like Charles Bronson.

365
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,040
没听到尖叫声之前 绝不罢休
We don't stop till the screaming starts, you dig?

366
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:04,779
我知道了
I'm with you.

367
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,610
走吧
Let's go.

368
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,223
好
Yeah.

369
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,554
去吓人吧
Let's kick some ass.

370
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:14,484
来吧 一、二、三…
Here we go. One, two, three...

371
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:18,397
早安 我的宝贝们 你们好
Good morning, my darlings. Hello.

372
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,161
沃特豪太太 信都在桌上
The mail's on the table, Mrs. Waterhouse.

373
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:21,793
谢谢 席维雅
Thank you, Sylvia.

374
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,362

376
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,002
亲一下
Big kiss.

377
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,805
不要到处乱跳 像个小婴儿一样
All right, kid, quit jumping around and acting like a baby.

378
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:34,746
这是很严肃的
This is serious.

379
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:38,578
我们要把你爸妈吓到屁滚尿流
Now, we're gonna scare the living daylights out of your parents.

380
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:40,819
你要帮我们吗？
So, come on, kid, you gonna help us out?

381
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:42,880
是不是跟我们一国？
Are you with us?

382
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:46,186
看到没？他都懂 小孩最聪明了
See? He gets it. The kids always get it.

383
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:47,990
- 来吧
- 好　
-Let's go.  -All right.

384

沃特豪太太
Mrs. Waterhouse.

385
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,373
沃特豪太太！
Mrs. Waterhouse!

386
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:05,242
糟糕 这个刚才便便了
Damn. Here, man. This one did le poo-poo.

387
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:07,440
- 离我远一点　　　
- 天哪他们有够小…
-Get it away from me. -Man, they're so little.

388
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:08,914
大便却臭得要死
Their doo-doo smells like old shoes.

389
00:28:08,984 --> 00:28:10,849
沃特豪太太！
Mrs. Waterhouse!

390
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:14,983
我的宝宝！
My babies!

391
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:25,827
是 我是法兰克班尼斯特
Yeah, Frank Bannister.

392
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:29,864
马上就到
I'm on my way.

393
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:32,498
法官 你得跟我一起去
Judge. Need you riding shotgun.

394
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:34,232
太好了
Yes.

395
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:42,575
该死！快点走啊
Damn it! Come on, come on.

396
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,243
快点开啊
Let's go. Come on. D for drive.

397
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:47,914
法兰克 四处看看 你难道不知发生什么事？
Look around you, Frank.Don't you realize what's happening?

398
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:49,820
知道啊 路上大多是灵车
Yeah, every other car's a freaking hearse.

399
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:52,121
快点 我要到镇上去
Come on, I can't even get across town.

400
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:55,492
这城镇有麻烦了
This town is in deep trouble.

401
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:58,358
太多葬礼 太少交通号志
Yeah. Too many funerals, not enough traffic lights.

402
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:00,424
法兰克 死神又来了
It's death, Frank.

403
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:03,994
在我们中间
Death is amongst us.

404
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:08,242
快点啦 时间就是金钱
Come on, let's go. Time is money.

405
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:10,470
你根本没在听我说话！
You haven't heard a goddamn word I've said.

406
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:12,445
小子 我还以为你很特别…
I thought you had some character, son.

407
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,914
照现在看来 可不是那么一回事
But right now you're not showing me much.

408
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:17,247
法官 你说得没错 看好了
All right, Judge.Watch this.

409
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,181
小心点
Look out!

410
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:34,731
法官 怎么啦？你看起来脸色苍白
What's the matter, Judge? You look a little pale.

411
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:47,276
太棒了
Beautiful. Beautiful,

412
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,714
法官 太棒了 这一定轻松到家
Judge.This is gonna be easy.

413
00:29:49,784 --> 00:29:52,810
你好好休息一下吧？我马上就回来
Why don't you just rest your bones?I'll be right back.

414
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,214
太太
Ma'am.

415
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:01,791
灵魂到访过的痕迹
Persistent residue of the departed.

416
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:04,127
每年这个时候都有这种问题
It's always a problem this time of year.

417
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,064
我是法兰克班尼斯特 你有打电话来
Frank Bannister, I believe you called.

418
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:08,398
立刻就到府上服务 我的天哪
Not a minute too soon. Oh, boy.

419
00:30:09,237 --> 00:30:11,102
- 法兰克她…
- 闭嘴　　　
- Frank, she just. .. - Shut up.

420
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,197
法兰克 没有用 她…
Frank, it's no use. She...

421
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:14,899
太糟糕了
This is bad.

422
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:18,207
无意识的意志力
Recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis.

423
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:21,910
这可能是我见过…
Yeah, this could be the

424
00:30:21,983 --> 00:30:23,848
地方骗子常出没于墓园
worst case I have ever...

425
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,647
最糟的一件
...seen.

426
00:30:28,823 --> 00:30:31,383
班尼斯特先生 不好意思 打电话麻烦你
I apologize for calling you, Mr. Bannister.

427
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:32,585
请离开
Please leave.

428
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,688
你到底想搞什么鬼？
What the hell are you trying to do to me?

429
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:40,633
利用受害者家属 实在是很低劣
Preying on the bereaved is about as low as you can go.

430
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:44,035
班尼斯特先生 你是个害虫 大众应该警觉
You're a parasite, Mr. Bannister, and people should be warned.

431
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:47,040
我有权利服务大众
Yeah, well, I got a right to offer my services to the public.

432
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:48,473
要是你没注意到…
In case you hadn't noticed,

433
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:50,943
镇上居民现在面临很严重的健康危机
we are in the midst of a major health crisis.

434
00:30:51,012 --> 00:30:53,480
费尔沃特镇更不需要…
The last thing the people of Fairwater need is some

435
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:56,608
你这种不要脸的小瘪三 利用死人来…
two-bit charlatan promising to pass on bogus messages from the other side.

436
00:30:56,684 --> 00:30:58,083
欺骗无辜民众
Now, if you will

437
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:00,246
不好意思
excuse me.

438
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:06,894
- 我只想讨生活
- 生活？　　　
-I'm just trying to make a living. -Living?

439
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:10,928
班尼斯特先生 你又懂什么生活？
Not a word you'd know a lot about. Is it,

440
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,994
费尔沃特时报
Mr. Bannister?

441
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,595
小心点
Easy.

442
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,434
混蛋
Asshole.

443
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,742
你没事吧 老兄？
You all right, buddy?

444
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,253
你摔得真惨
Man, you took quite a fall.

445
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:08,983
- 班尼斯特！
- 是　　　　
-Bannister!  -Yeah.

446
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,490
听着 我需要帮助
Listen, you gotta help.

447
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:13,356
他们要把我埋了 你得帮帮我
They're gonna bury me, man. You gotta help.

448
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:15,953
班尼斯特 我怎么搞的？
Bannister, what is happening to me?

449
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,930
雷 你死了
Well, Ray, you appear to be dead.

450
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:20,695
别这样说 那是不可能的 我身体好得很
Don't say that. That's impossible. I'm in the prime of my life.

451
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:23,703
我每天都健身 我太太还是个医生！
I work out every single day. My wife's a goddamn doctor!

452
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,262
- 你为什么不走通道？
- 什么通道？　　　　
-Why didn't you take the corridor? -What corridor?

453
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,935
生命的通道 到另一个世界的通道
The corridor of life. The passageway to the other side.

454
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,342
因为我不想去另一个世界！
Because I don't belong on the other side!

455
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:33,539
老天爷啊 我才29岁
Jesus Christ, I'm only 29.

456
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:38,175
雷…
Look, Ray,

457
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:40,177
放轻松一点
just relax, all right?

458
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:41,586
告诉我发生了什么事
You wanna tell me what happened?

459
00:32:41,656 --> 00:32:43,248
我本来在划船机上…
I was on the rowing machine

460
00:32:43,324 --> 00:32:46,054
然后我的心脏突然间…
and then suddenly I felt this viselike grip

461
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:49,028
一阵抽痛 然后我无法呼吸
just squeezing my heart and I couldn't breathe, Frank.

462
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:51,361
完全不能呼吸…
I just couldn't breathe and...

463
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,801
我吓坏了 我需要一点维他命B
I've got the shakes now. I need some vitamin B.

464
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,395
你不能再吃维他命了
Yeah, you can't take vitamins any more.

465
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:01,736
你不能吃 不能喝 不需要上洗手间
You don't eat, you don't drink, you don't go to the bathroom.

466
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:03,800
一切都结束了
All that shit's over with.

467
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:06,244
你在一年内 一定要走到…
In about a year's time you're gonna get a chance

468
00:33:06,314 --> 00:33:07,611
通道另一头
to go through to the other side again.

469
00:33:07,682 --> 00:33:09,513
成为灵魂
To become what's known as a pure spirit.

470
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:12,417
不过现在你算是在地上游走的幽魂…
But in the meantime,you're what's known as an earthbound emanation

471
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:14,853
基本上就是一团像云雾的物体…
which is a rotting cloud of bioplasmic particles

472
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:17,221
能够渗过各种空隙
dripping ectoplasm from every orifice.

473
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,361
雷 冷静点
Relax, Ray.

474
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:32,305
好 班尼斯特…
All right, Bannister,

475
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:35,776
我得赶去自己的葬礼 可不可载我一程？
can you at least give me a ride so I don't miss my funeral?

476
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,383
好 雷 听着
Okay, Ray, listen up.

477
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:46,852
墓园不安全 知道吗？所以小心点
The cemetery's not a safe place. All right? So stay close.

478
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:50,322
班尼斯特 等等 我想听听他们在说什么
Later, Bannister. I wanna hear what they're saying about me.

479
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:04,261
不要担心 他们不会伤害你
Don't worry about them. They're not gonna to hurt you.

480
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:08,435
这儿到底发生了什么事？
What in the hell is going on out here?

481
00:34:08,509 --> 00:34:10,568
快点回到坟墓里去！
Get back in your graves!

482
00:34:10,712 --> 00:34:13,613
- 你这个畜…
- 天哪！　　
-Son of a... -Holy Jesus!

483
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:17,217
- 法兰克班尼斯特！
- 去吧我来就好　　
-Frank Bannister! -Go ahead. I'll handle this.

484
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:22,715
你在我坟墓上做什么？
What the hell are you doing in my graveyard?

485
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,122
给我离远一点！
You have been told to stay away!

486
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:27,257
给我像个男人一点！
Sound off like you've got a pair!

487
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:28,761
海尔 不要这么激动
Yeah, well, it's a public place, Hiles.

488
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,263
我不喜欢你！
I do not like you!

489
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:33,698
你不可以任意带鬼到这儿来！
You cannot bring your spooks in here without my permission!

490
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:35,633
快滚 败类！
Disappear, scumbag!

491
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,416
班尼斯特 我可不是什么游魂
I am not one of your shitty little emanations, Bannister.

492
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:51,782
你根本对付不了鬼魂
You cannot push spirits around.

493
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:56,153
你这个大败类！用鬼来吓人！
You are scum! Using spooks to put the frighteners on people!

494
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:58,586
让我觉得很恶心！
That makes me physically ill!

495
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,085
这儿有很多幽魂！
We got a lot of lowlifes around here!

496
00:35:02,196 --> 00:35:06,064
要是有麻烦 我立刻行动！
And I will provide an armed response at the first sign of trouble!

497
00:35:06,134 --> 00:35:08,068
不准给我离开！
They must be contained!

498
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:16,568
海尔 待会见
Catch you later, Hiles.

499
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:19,409
我还剩85年！
My tour of duty runs another 85 years!

500
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:23,508
班尼斯特 你在这也有一片烂墓地！
There's a piece of dirt up here with your name on it, Bannister!

501
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:26,213
我等你回来 你这个小懦夫！
I'm waiting for you, you little maggot!

502
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:30,383
有时候 有人认为雷不够慷慨…
There were times when people have accused Ray of being

503
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:34,822
不过我相信他的内心深处…
less than generous, but I'm sure, deep down

504
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:40,714
一定是非常仁慈和大方
the man possessed a heart of gold and a generous spirit.

505
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:43,105
是真的
It's true.

506
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:45,974
他不会说谎 在这种时候绝不会
He wouldn't lie. Not at a time like this.

507
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:53,847
因为神呼召了我们的兄弟雷…
Because God has chosen to call our brother Ray

508
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,911
回到天家…
from this life to Himself

509
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,253
我们将他的身体放入大地
we commit his body to the ground.

510
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,418
尘归尘 土归土
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

511
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:02,552
天哪 真是浪费
Jesus, what a waste.

512
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,597
- 愿神保佑看顾他
- 真是个悲剧　　
The Lord bless him and keep him. -It's a goddamn tragedy.

513
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:09,260
愿神给他安慰 让他安息主的怀抱
The Lord lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace.

514
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,031
雷 再见
Goodbye, Ray.

515
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:21,277
甜心 别哭了
Sweetheart, don't cry.

516
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,643
喔 糟糕！
Oh, shit!

517
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:48,634
法兰克！
Frank!

518
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:52,301
我知道你听得到
I know you can hear me.

519
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,539
班尼斯特 救我出去
Get me out of this hole, Bannister.

520
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,439
法兰克
Frank.

521
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:59,178
- 求求你救我出去
- 法兰克你好　　
-Get me out of this hole, please. -Hi, Frank.

522
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,750
- 嘿华特　　　　
- 没想到会看到你
-Hey, Walt. -Kind of surprised to see you.

523
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,918
- 出公差吗？
- 不算是　　
-Here on business, I guess? -Not exactly.

524
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:08,460
班尼斯特 他们要活埋我
Bannister, they're gonna bury me alive in here.

525
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:11,725
我知道你和林斯基在他死前那晚…
I understand you and Lynskey had a little run-in

526
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:13,663
起了点小争执
the night before he died.

527
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,495
事实上 除了他太太…
As a matter of fact, apart from his wife

528
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:19,663
你是最后一个看到他的人
I believe you were the last person to see him alive.

529
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:22,902
华特 应该是你在出公差吧
It sounds like you're the one who's here on business, Walt.

530
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:27,571
不是 联邦调查局很关切这些命案
No. The FBI is very concerned about these deaths.

531
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:31,941
看似是心脏病 但验尸时却发现…
They look like heart attacks but when they slice these people open

532
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:35,454
他们的血管一点问题也没有
their arteries are just clean as a whistle.

533
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,050
不过心脏却曾经承受极大的压力…
But there's been this tremendous pressure on the heart

534
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,424
就像被活活掐死一样
like the life has just been crushed right out of it.

535
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:46,126
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
法兰克有什么解释吗？班尼斯特！
-You got any theories, Frank? -Bannister!

536
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:52,462
不介意我最后看他一眼吧？
Mind if I pay my last respects before they fill him in?

537
00:37:53,573 --> 00:37:55,268
不 抱歉
Oh! No. I'm sorry.

538
00:37:58,211 --> 00:38:02,204
班尼斯特 求求你
Bannister, please.

539
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:19,424
我需要找点乐子
I need to cheer up.

540
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:21,433
班尼斯特先生？
Mr. Bannister?

541
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:25,798
班尼斯特先生 你想见我吗？
Mr. Bannister, did you want to see me?

542
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:28,766
喔 我的天哪 她看得到我
Oh, my God, Frank. She can see me.

543
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:35,571
我想雷可能有托话给你
I thought perhaps you might have a message from Ray.

544
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:39,313
告诉她 告诉她我在这儿 告诉她
Tell her. Tell her I'm here, Frank. Tell her.

545
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,716
大家都说你是个骗子…
I mean, everyone says that you're a fraud

546
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,914
不过我知道你是认真的
but I've seen what you can do.

547
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:47,219
法兰克！
Frank!

548
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,691
你一定觉得我很蠢
You must think I'm very stupid.

549
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:54,626
不好意思
Excuse me.

550
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,328
露西…
Lucy,

551
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:01,970
雷说他很爱你
Ray says he loves you very much.

552
00:39:12,285 --> 00:39:14,515
这边请 桌子在这儿
Here you are. Here's your table.

553
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:17,119
- 你好
- 你好
-Hi.  -Hi.

554
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:23,557
雷跟我们在一起吗？
Is Ray with us?

555
00:39:25,765 --> 00:39:27,164
对
Yeah.

556
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:29,360
说她今天看起来很漂亮
Tell her she looks great.

557
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:33,565
他说你今天看起来很漂亮
He says that you look great.

558
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:43,205
- 说是我说的
- 是雷说的　
-Tell her they're from me. -Those are from Ray.

559
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,040
今天是我们的周年庆
It's our anniversary.

560
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:48,586
对了 他说今天是你们的周年庆
Right. He says it's your anniversary.

561
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:51,751
雷在我身边吗？
Is Ray beside me?

562
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:56,722
他在这儿
He's over here.

563
00:39:58,297 --> 00:40:00,595
你们今晚好吗？
Greetings. How are you this evening?

564
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,498
想喝点酒吗？
May I offer you some wine?

565
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:07,232
露西 你想喝点白酒还是红酒？
I don't know. Lucy, do you want some, what, red, white?

566
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:09,701
红酒 我们每次都喝红酒
Red, we always have red.

567
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:12,476
白酒 我从来都不喜欢喝红酒
White. I've never been fond of red.

568
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,004
露西！
Lucy!

569
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:21,216
你以前是建筑师？
So you used to be an architect?

570
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:23,482
- 很久以前　　　
- 班尼斯特安静点
-A long time ago.  -Can it, Bannister.

571
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:25,353
她不想听你的生平故事
She doesn't want to hear your life story.

572
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:28,154
你自己盖的房子？
Wow. So did you build your own house?

573
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,953
一定是你的梦想屋吧
I mean, you must have a dream home.

574
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,258
可以算是吧
You could call it a dream home.

575
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:34,060
甜心 我一回到现实世界…
I'm gonna build you a dream home, sweetheart,

576
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:35,725
就帮你盖一个梦想屋
just as soon as I get on my feet.

577
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,200
最好是
Yeah.

578
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,535
为什么你看得到雷 而我却不行？
Tell me, why is it that you can see Ray and I can't?

579
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:44,501
我5年前出了一场意外…
I was in an accident, a car accident

580
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:48,040
一场车祸
about five years ago.

581
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,812
我不知道 他们说…
I don't know. They say that

582
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:57,583
人经历一场浩劫后…
sometimes when you have a traumatic experience

583
00:40:57,657 --> 00:41:00,558
想法会有所改变
that it can alter your perception.

584
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,386
所以你能看到灵魂？
Really, so after that you could just see spirits?

585
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,397
发生什么事了？
I mean, what happened?

586
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:12,367
要跟雷说话吗？不然我来这就没意义了
How about you talk to Ray? That's why I'm here.

587
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:15,066
我终于能参与这场谈话了 太好了
Oh, finally, I'm in the conversation. Terrific.

588
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:18,042
我真的有一个很重要的问题…
Well, actually I do have an important question

589
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,771
想要问雷
that I have to ask Ray.

590
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:21,674
他听得到你
Well, he can hear you.

591
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:29,385
雷 我想知道你把我所存的…
Ray, I really need to know where you invested my money,

592
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:34,655
1万6千元投资到哪去了
the $16,000 that I had saved.

593
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:38,056
律师都找不到
The attorneys can't seem to find it anywhere.

594
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,792
糟糕 做生意失败了
Oh, shit. I blew it on a bad investment.

595
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,198
不要告诉她 让我想一想
But don't tell her that. I'll think of something.

596
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:47,668
露西 钱都没了 不见了 他生意失败
It's gone, Lucy. It's gone.He blew it on a bad investment.

597
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,571
你这个混蛋！
You asshole!

598
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:51,303
告诉她不会有事的
Tell her everything's gonna be okay.

599
00:41:51,377 --> 00:41:53,868
我一定会照顾她 我会搬回老家
I'm gonna look out for her. I'm gonna move back into the house.

600
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:56,437
- 快告诉她　　　
- 我才不要说假话
-Tell her that. -No, that's not a good idea.

601
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,574
班尼斯特 这不关你的事
Bannister, this doesn't concern you.

602
00:41:58,651 --> 00:42:00,448
雷在说什么？他在说什么？
What's Ray saying? What's he saying?

603
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,578
他离开了 雷离开了
He left. Ray left.

604
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:05,215
他说他很抱歉 不过他想让你静一静…
He said he was he was sorry,but he wanted to leave you alone,

605
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,690
好好开始过生活
let you get on with your life.

606
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:08,852
班尼斯特 我向天发誓 我会杀了你
I swear to God, Bannister, I'm gonna kill you.

607
00:42:08,928 --> 00:42:10,828
真不敢相信…
I can't believe it, I mean...

608
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:14,263
雷就是这样 拿了钱就跑…
That's just like Ray to just take the money and run, like...

609
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:20,267
班尼斯特先生 我和雷彼此之间…
Ray and I haven't been honest with each other

610
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,534
早就失去了坦诚
in a long time, Mr. Bannister.

611
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:28,006
并不算是一段美好的婚姻
It wasn't what you would call a good marriage.

612
00:42:28,814 --> 00:42:30,679
你这个婊子！
You bitch!

613
00:42:34,854 --> 00:42:38,722
露西 没关系
Lucy, it's gonna be okay.

614
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,492
把你的臭手拿开！
Get your hands off my wife!

615
00:42:42,762 --> 00:42:44,354
该死！
Goddamn it!

616
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46,255
对不起
Sorry.

617
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:48,997
班尼斯特 我可以乱动东西
I can move shit, Bannister.

618
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:51,059
你最好小心一点
Man, you better watch your back.

619
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:55,504
我最好清理一下 马上回来
I better clean this up. I'll be right back.

620
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:18,963
这儿食物不错吧？
Good food, huh?

621
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:22,700
是啊 很好吃
Yeah, it's great.

622
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,714
妈！
Mom.

623
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:22,625
看起来又像是心脏病…
Looks like another heart attack

624
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:25,163
不过在验尸报告出来之前 不能确认
but I can't confirm it till the autopsy.

625
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,754
该死
Damn.

626
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,226
服务生说发现尸体前5分钟…
The waiter says he saw this guy coming out of the john

627
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:31,462
看到一男子从洗手间走出来
about five minutes before the body was found.

628
00:45:31,537 --> 00:45:34,233
- 那是谁？　　　
- 法兰克班尼斯特
-And who might that have been? -Frank Bannister.

629
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:36,137
他当时脸色苍白 全身发抖
He was as white as a sheet and shaking.

630
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,642
- 服务生以为他不舒服
- 该死　　　　　　　
-Waiter thought he'd been sick. -Damn.

631
00:45:40,412 --> 00:45:42,403
- 嗨露西
- 露西？
-Hi, Lucy. -Lucy?

632
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:43,972
别过来
No.

633
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:46,313
林斯基医生替我工作 我们是同事
Dr. Lynskey works for me. We're colleagues.

634
00:45:46,385 --> 00:45:49,252
医生 她是很重要的证人
Look, Doc, she's a material witness, all right?

635
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,760
好
Okay.

636
00:45:57,563 --> 00:46:01,090
华特 有人在停车场看到班尼斯特
Walt, Bannister was last seen in the restaurant parking lot.

637
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,325
他离开时车开得很快
He took off at high speed.

638
00:46:07,573 --> 00:46:08,767
带他过来
Bring him in.

639
00:46:15,347 --> 00:46:16,939
你看看
Hey! Look at that.

640
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:53,374
你死去的先生跟你在餐厅一起用餐？
So your dead husband was having dinner with you at the restaurant?

641
00:46:56,488 --> 00:46:58,353
他点了什么？
What did he order?

642
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:06,087
失陪一下
Oh, God. Excuse me.

643
00:47:06,665 --> 00:47:08,189
提米
Timmy.

644
00:47:22,181 --> 00:47:24,513
提米 请到前面柜台
Timmy, front desk, please.

645
00:47:25,918 --> 00:47:27,385
谢谢
Thank you.

646
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:31,184
露西 这位是联邦探员米顿迪墨
Lucy, this is Special Agent Milton Dammers of the FBI.

647
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,225
我坐火车来的
I came by train.

648
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:43,826
我本来要坐飞机 不过我不太喜欢飞机
I was going to take the flight but I didn't feel good about the plane.

649
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,632
请问班尼斯特…
At what time precisely

650
00:47:47,706 --> 00:47:49,970
到底什么时候离开洗手间？
did Bannister leave for the bathroom?

651
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:52,643
你
You. Uh...

652
00:47:53,512 --> 00:47:56,276
我不太确定
I'm not sure, precisely.

653
00:47:57,382 --> 00:47:59,942
他吃饭的时候 有没有用很多盐巴？
Did he use excessive amounts of table salt during his meal?

654
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:02,009
- 什么？　
- 回答问题
-What?  -Answer the question.

655
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:04,653
拜托一下 很晚了
For Christ's sakes, it's really late.

656
00:48:04,723 --> 00:48:06,714
我根本记不得
I can't remember that, okay?

657
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:13,924
搞什么嘛？
Oh, God. What is this?

658
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,025
露西 不好意思 我马上回来
Excuse me, Lucy, I'll be right back.

659
00:48:21,974 --> 00:48:23,566
米顿？
Milton?

660
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,673
抱歉 警长
Sorry, Sheriff.

661
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,844
我很讨厌女人的尖叫声
I have a problem with women yelling.

662
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,107
米顿 需要帮忙吗？
Milton, can I get you anything?

663
00:48:33,886 --> 00:48:35,615
派瑞警长！
Sheriff Perry!

664
00:48:36,188 --> 00:48:38,520
你侵犯到我的私人空间
You are violating my territorial bubble.

665
00:48:49,768 --> 00:48:51,895
露西 我知道你很难过
Lucy, you're still grieving.

666
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:56,071
易受到法兰克班尼斯特这种人的利用
It would be very easy for a man like Frank Bannister to take advantage.

667
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:59,674
你的心眼怎么这么小 真是不可思议
You have such closed minds. I can't believe it.

668
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:01,337
我反对
I object.

669
00:49:03,615 --> 00:49:05,742
特务探员迪墨先生…
Special Agent Dammers

670
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,685
有超过20年的办案经验…
has over 20 years experience in the area

671
00:49:10,055 --> 00:49:12,319
对于超自然心理学很有研究
of paranormal psychology.

672
00:49:12,524 --> 00:49:15,789
他花很多时间在不同教派…
Much of that was spent undercover with various

673
00:49:17,129 --> 00:49:19,063
和团体间做卧底
cults and sects.

674
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:22,461
林斯基太太 我看过太多疯狂的事了
I get all the fruity cases, Mrs. Lynskey.

675
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:26,132
米顿 你可不可以进来坐下？
For God's sake, Milton, would you come inside and sit down?

676
00:49:26,205 --> 00:49:27,900
我比较喜欢站着 谢谢你
I'm more comfortable standing. Thank you.

677
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:30,373
这件事跟法兰克班尼斯特毫无关系
I really don't see what this has to do with Frank Bannister.

678
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:33,843
林斯基太太 你并不了解法兰克班尼斯特
Mrs. Lynskey, you know nothing about Frank Bannister.

679
00:49:33,912 --> 00:49:36,176
你宣称他是真正的灵媒…
You claim he's a bona fide psychic

680
00:49:36,248 --> 00:49:39,809
不过我听到的却是胡言乱语
yet all I've heard is a lot of ill-informed, meandering waffle.

681
00:49:40,953 --> 00:49:43,080
1990年7月3日…
On the third day of July 1990,

682
00:49:43,956 --> 00:49:47,483
法兰克班尼斯特当时是位成功的建筑师…
Frank Bannister, then a successful architect

683
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,255
忙着新家的工程
was overseeing the construction of his new home.

684
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:55,722
建筑商雅各普莱兹事后确认…
Now, the building contractor, Jacob Platz, would later confirm

685
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:58,964
班尼斯特那天早上的确喝了酒
that Bannister had been consuming alcohol that morning.

686
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:03,771
晚间12点23分 普莱兹看到班尼斯特…
12:23 p.m., Platz sees Bannister

687
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:06,709
和他太太黛布拉在吵架
in a heated argument with his wife, Debra.

688
00:50:06,778 --> 00:50:09,576
据说班尼斯特答应 要帮黛布拉在新家…
It appears that Bannister had promised Debra a garden

689
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:10,979
盖一座花园…
in the new home

690
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,643
不过后来未经她同意…
and then, without consulting her, proceeded to lay

691
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,880
就铺下10公分高的水泥…
a four-inch thick concrete slab

692
00:50:15,954 --> 00:50:18,354
为自己盖了一座篮球场
creating a basketball court for himself.

693
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,587
12点31分…
12:31 p.m.

694
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:25,926
普莱兹看到他们夫妻俩驾车离去
Platz watches the couple drive away.

695
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,892
班尼斯特的后车厢有一个工具盒
Bannister kept a tool box in the back of his car.

696
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,105
里面装有万用弹簧小刀
And in it was a utility knife with a retractable blade.

697
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:41,370
班尼斯特那天早上…
Bannister purchased seven new blades

698
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,175
在三街和嘉耐街转角的…
that morning

699
00:50:44,316 --> 00:50:47,285
莱森建筑工具店…
at Jesson's Hardware Store and Building Supply

700
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,148
买了不少新的刀片
on the corner of 3rd and Garrett.

701
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,951
7月3号
Third of July.

702
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:55,421
7把刀片 3
Seven blades. Three.

703
00:50:55,827 --> 00:50:56,987
米顿…
Milton,

704
00:50:57,062 --> 00:51:00,589
你在喃喃自语 我们根本听不懂
you're mumbling. We can't understand a word you're saying.

705
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,657
中午12点33分…
12:33 p.m.

706
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,669
他们开着84年代的富豪汽车往山上去
and their '84 Volvo heads into the hills.

707
00:51:06,738 --> 00:51:10,105
那是他们最后一次一起出游
It is the last time anyone will see the couple together.

708
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:14,770
当时班尼斯特和太太不断争吵…
Now, by Bannister's own admission,the argument continues to rage

709
00:51:14,846 --> 00:51:17,644
吵到不能再吵时 黛比拉叫班尼斯特停车…
reaching the climactic point when Debra demands that Bannister stop,

710
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:19,115
靠边停 让她下车
pull over, let her out.

711
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:22,483
就在那一刻 晚上12点36或37分…
And at that moment, probably 12:36, 12:37 p.m.

712
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:25,523
车子在急转弯处冲出马路…
the car leaves the road on a sharp curve

713
00:51:26,258 --> 00:51:30,194
都因为班尼斯特开得太快
presumably because Bannister was driving too fast.

714
00:51:31,697 --> 00:51:33,562
所以她死了？
She was killed?

715
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:39,135
她飞到车子14公尺之外
Her body was found some 15 yards from the car.

716
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,063
而班尼斯特…
Now, Bannister,

717
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,836
2个小时后 在树林中被警方找到
he was picked up two hours later, wandering in the woods.

718
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:48,572
他宣称车祸发生后…
He claimed to have no recollection of the events that occurred

719
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,581
就完全失去了记忆
after the accident.

720
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,645
林斯基太太 不过很奇怪的是…
But here's the odd thing, Mrs. Lynskey.

721
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:57,783
他的万用小刀不见了
His utility knife was missing.

722
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:03,091
至今都没被找到
And to this day it has not been found.

723
00:52:04,396 --> 00:52:07,888
你们知道还有什么怪事吗？
But do you know what was really bizarre?

724
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:12,830
黛布拉的额头上…
Debra's corpse had the number 13

725
00:52:12,904 --> 00:52:14,929
刻有13号的字样
carved into its forehead.

726
00:52:17,642 --> 00:52:19,507
不吉祥的数字
Unlucky for some.

727
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,447
拜托 你疯了
Oh, come on. You're out of your mind.

728
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,350
你说的根本是虚构人物
You're talking about a mythical figure.

729
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:32,447
12世纪的假冒宗教领袖
A pseudo-religious icon from the 12th century.

730
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:37,588
小子 别再说一堆没大脑的废话了
Save your pea brain prattle for the classroom, boy.

731
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,457
那明明是死神…
That was the soul collector

732
00:52:42,134 --> 00:52:46,696
他一向以杀人为乐
and he's been taking people out since time began.

733
00:52:47,472 --> 00:52:51,602
他要在费尔沃特镇大开杀戒…
He's going about some dark business here in Fairwater

734
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,535
我们只不过是饵
and we ain't nothing but worm bait.

735
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:59,615
时候到了 死路一条
When your number's up, that's it.

736
00:53:05,023 --> 00:53:07,048
又有人死了
There's another one gone.

737
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:19,032
{\an8}古埃及之秘密

738
00:53:19,104 --> 00:53:22,562
{\an8}费尔沃特博物馆证物防腐保存

739
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,608
他不见了
He's gone.

740
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,478
班尼斯特先生 我们不会给你钱
There's no money for you here, Mr. Bannister.

741
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,149
你是下一个
You're next.

742
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:12,087
你在吓我吗？
Are you threatening me?

743
00:54:12,257 --> 00:54:14,452
不 我不是那意思
No, that's not what I'm saying.

744
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:17,051
- 他想要杀我　
- 放轻松好吗？
-He's threatening to kill me. -Would you just relax, all right?

745
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,324
- 听我说…　　　　
- 他想要把我给杀了
-Just listen to me and... -He's threatening to kill me.

746
00:54:19,397 --> 00:54:21,524
- 班尼斯特！
- 太好了　　
-Bannister!  -Oh, great.

747
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,429
- 好　　　
- 不好意思
-Okay. -Excuse me.

748
00:54:23,502 --> 00:54:24,730
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

749
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,395
不好意思
Excuse me.

750
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,268
- 把枪拿开好吗？
- 不要动　　　　
-Put the gun away, all right? -Freeze.

751
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,706
各位 请放松
All right, everybody, just take it easy.

752
00:54:42,787 --> 00:54:45,085
班尼斯特 不要动 不要动
Just stay there, Bannister. Stay there.

753
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:51,552
好险
Yes.

754
00:54:58,904 --> 00:54:59,928
好极了
Ah! Great.

755
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,666
我成功了
I did it.

756
00:55:02,107 --> 00:55:03,335
法官
Judge.

757
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:04,739
　　　　　　　
班尼斯特不要动
Uh-uh, uh-uh. Bannister, stop.

758
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:08,802
看来我不是用空包弹
Looks like I ain't shooting with blanks no more.

759
00:55:12,651 --> 00:55:14,380
真是太美了
Mighty fine woman.

760
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:16,218
牙齿很漂亮
Good teeth.

761
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:18,848
- 把手放在讲台上
- 法官　　　　　
-Now put your hands on the -podium.

762
00:55:18,924 --> 00:55:20,585
不要动！
Judge.

763
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,427
法官大师可不是白叫的
They don't call me the hanging judge for nothing.

764
00:55:30,502 --> 00:55:32,129
不要动
Stay right there.

765
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,300
小心点
Heads up.

766
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,002
接得好
Good catch.

767
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,494
不要动！
Freeze!

768
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:10,472
泰斯 好枪法
Whoa! Good shooting, Tex.

769
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,345
她本来又年轻又美丽！
And she was so young and beautiful!

770
00:56:30,028 --> 00:56:33,293
我最喜欢她们这样躺好
I like it when they lie still like that.

771
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,128
好重
This is heavy.

772
00:56:46,645 --> 00:56:49,307
我觉得青春无比
My juices are flowing again.

773
00:56:54,886 --> 00:56:56,478
法官！
Judge!

774
00:56:59,724 --> 00:57:01,089
班尼斯特！
Bannister!

775
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,719
法兰克 快点离开
Go, Frank.Just get out of here now.

776
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,387
混蛋！
Bastard!

777
00:57:07,332 --> 00:57:08,993
先走一步
Gotta go.

778
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:11,635
- 班尼斯特
- 不要动　
-Bannister!  -Stop.

779
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,098
该死 快点啊
Damn. Come on.

780
00:57:58,416 --> 00:57:59,678
{\an8}贺乐威路

781
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:08,073
趴下去 不要起来
Just get down. Get down and stay down.

782
00:58:16,084 --> 00:58:17,676
喔 不
Oh, no.

783
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,552
- 麦姬达！
- 不！　　
-Magda!  -No!

784
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,212
听我说
Listen to me.

785
00:59:07,512 --> 00:59:08,512
天哪
Oh, God.

786
00:59:12,907 --> 00:59:14,431
不！
No!

787
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:21,171
不！
No!

788
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:27,913
喔 不
Oh, no.

789
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,125
你这个混蛋 你杀了我！
You killed me, you bastard!

790
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,859
你这个变态 这样会让你得到快感吗？
You're sick. Is this how you get your kicks?

791
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:41,060
你觉得杀死我很爽吗？
Did it feel good killing me?

792
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,063
班尼斯特 你觉得杀死你太太很爽吗？
Bannister, did it feel good killing your wife?

793
00:59:45,139 --> 00:59:49,132
你这个杀人魔！
You're a murderer!

794
01:00:01,049 --> 01:00:04,246
我想他应该逃不远 边界到处是警察
I don't believe he'll get very far.We've got the state line covered.

795
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,014
派瑞警长…
Sheriff Perry,

796
01:00:06,087 --> 01:00:09,750
我想我们该不会再看到班尼斯特先生了
I seriously doubt we will see Mr. Bannister any time soon.

797
01:00:09,824 --> 01:00:13,658
他比你想像中的更厉害
The man is resourceful beyond anything you can comprehend.

798
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:20,692
- 哈罗法兰克
- 嗨华特　　
-Hello, Frank. -Hi, Walt.

799
01:00:21,653 --> 01:00:25,487
我想向你们报告麦格达瑞斯琼斯的…
I've come to report that Magda Rees-Jones'

800
01:00:26,591 --> 01:00:29,389
遗体在和乐卫街上…
body is lying near my car

801
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,862
在我的车子附近
off Holloway Road.

802
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:36,130
法兰克 你和她的死有没有什么关系？
Frank, did you have anything to do with her death?

803
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:41,662
法兰克！
Frank!

804
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:44,765
法兰克 你还好吗？发生什么事了？
Frank, are you okay? What happened?

805
01:00:46,244 --> 01:00:47,973
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

806
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:50,737
- 你要逮捕他吗？　　
- 林斯基太太请别插手
-Are you arresting him? -Please leave, Mrs. Lynskey.

807
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,045
法兰克 你需要找律师
Frank. Frank, you need a lawyer.

808
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:55,016
露西 快回家
Go home, Lucy.

809
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,747
但你什么也没做 他什么也没做
But you haven't done anything. He hasn't done anything.

810
01:00:57,822 --> 01:00:59,687
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

811
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:01,622
你认识我吗？
You know me?

812
01:01:01,893 --> 01:01:04,157
露西 我是好人吗？因为…
Am I a nice guy, Lucy? 'Cause

813
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:09,097
餐厅的那件事根本就是狗屁 因为…
that cozy little scene in the restaurant was bullshit,

814
01:01:11,069 --> 01:01:12,502
那不过是我的工作
I was doing my job.

815
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:15,869
我才不在乎你 我不在乎任何人
And I don't give a damn about you.I don't give a damn about anybody.

816
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,670
- 你在胡说什么？
- 快回家　　　　
-What the hell are you saying? -Go home.

817
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:21,702
好了
Okay.

818
01:01:26,584 --> 01:01:29,382
- 露西你能开车吗？
- 可以　　　　　　
-Lucy, are you okay to drive? -Yeah.

819
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:43,363
想玩亲亲吗？
Got a kiss for honey bunny?

820
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:49,235
我知道 我知道我看起来很恐怖…
I know, I know. It's the way I look.

821
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,604
看起来像鬼魂
It's this damn ectoplasm stuff.

822
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,605
让你觉得很恶心对不对？
Turns you off, doesn't it?

823
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:57,374
露西 别这样 你根本没在听我说话！
Come on, Lucy. You're not listening to me!

824
01:01:58,616 --> 01:02:01,084
宝贝 你明明知道我们的感情很好
Well, look, you know we have a great relationship.

825
01:02:01,152 --> 01:02:02,210
只不过…
It's just that lately

826
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:05,221
我觉得你最近好像都心不在焉
I don't feel that you've been giving it your 100%.

827
01:02:07,492 --> 01:02:12,054
这镇上现在有一股我从来没见过的…
There has been a destructive force unleashed on this town

828
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:14,826
恶势力在猖狂
such as I have never seen.

829
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,836
目前死亡人数高达…
We have a body count of

830
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:23,998
28人
twenty-eight.

831
01:02:26,644 --> 01:02:28,737
班尼斯特先生 你是个危险人物
You're a very dangerous man, Mr. Bannister.

832
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:30,110
拜托…
For Christ's sake

833
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:32,911
你该不会觉得班尼斯特跟这些…
you're not seriously suggestingthat Frank is responsible for...

834
01:02:32,984 --> 01:02:35,885
派瑞警长 你不会懂的
You're way out of your depth here, Sheriff Perry.

835
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:37,846
请离开
Please leave.

836
01:02:38,456 --> 01:02:40,720
法兰克班尼斯特是我的囚犯
Frank Bannister is my prisoner.

837
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:45,992
美国总统给予我的权力…
By the power invested in me by the President of the United States

838
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:47,724
我警告你…
I am telling you

839
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:50,825
快点离开这里
to get the hell out of this room.

840
01:03:25,436 --> 01:03:27,700
你有听过妮娜库拉吉娜吗？
Have you ever heard of Nina Kulagina?

841
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:32,672
1970年3月10号 妮娜库拉吉娜利用意志力…
March 10, 1970. Nina Kulagina with the power of her mind

842
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:35,007
让一只青蛙心跳暂停
stopped the beat of a frog's heart.

843
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:38,471
这个实验的纪录目前收藏在…
The record of this experiment is currently held

844
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:41,677
圣匹兹堡当地一位叫…
in the files of Professor Gennady Sergeyev

845
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,115
沙利格夫教授那儿
of Saint Petersburg.

846
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:47,954
沙利格夫在研究这个实验…
And as Sergeyev interpreted this cardiogram

847
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:49,925
他觉得心脏因为瞬间…
it seemed to him that the heart had experienced

848
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:51,586
增加的电流而负荷不支
a sudden flare-up of electrical activity.

849
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,687
妮娜库拉吉娜想杀死小动物…
The heart imploded, the arteries burst

850
01:03:53,764 --> 01:03:57,427
所以让它的心脏在体内爆炸 血管破裂
and all because Nina Kulagina wanted the animal dead.

851
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:03,667
我不杀人
I don't kill people.

852
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10,445
一部份的你以为如此
There's a part of you that believes that.

853
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:14,573
法兰克 另一部份的你…
There's another part of you, Frank,

854
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:16,548
却早已失控
that's out of control.

855
01:04:17,889 --> 01:04:20,016
你那具有破坏力的冲动
Your destructive impulse.

856
01:04:22,927 --> 01:04:25,054
我看过穿着袍子的身影
I've seen a figure in a cape.

857
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:31,059
我看过他伸手到人们胸口 对他们心脏施压
I've seen him reach into people's chests and squeeze their hearts.

858
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:33,795
是谁？
Who

859
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:39,400
是谁？
was it?

860
01:04:42,413 --> 01:04:43,937
死神
Death.

861
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:48,447
我能够通灵
I can communicate with the other side.

862
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:51,750
我有阴阳眼
I can see spirits.

863
01:04:53,491 --> 01:04:56,619
我不知道为什么 我也不懂
I don't know why. I can't understand it.

864
01:04:58,095 --> 01:05:01,758
班尼斯特先生 你觉得自己很特别是吧？
You think you're quite unique, don't you, Mr. Bannister?

865
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,896
不过我做这一行 看过太多像你的人了
But in my business, I deal with your type every other week.

866
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:10,396
这个死神…
This Death figure

867
01:05:10,675 --> 01:05:14,111
不过是为了满足…
is nothing more than a homicidal alter ego

868
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:17,011
你内心想杀人的冲动
that satisfies your compulsion to kill.

869
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,105
不是
No.

870
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:20,275
每次你想杀人的时候…
Every time you want to take somebody out

871
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:22,876
死神就会出现并替你动手
Death figure suddenly appears, does the job for you.

872
01:05:22,954 --> 01:05:26,321
这只是你掩饰罪恶感的一种防卫功能
It's your rational mind's way of absolving yourself of guilt.

873
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,614
不是！
No!

874
01:05:27,692 --> 01:05:31,389
法兰克 你几时有了阴阳眼？黛布拉死后？
When did you first start seeing spirits, Frank?After Debra's death?

875
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:35,656
你杀了你太太
You killed your wife.

876
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:37,394
才没有！
No!

877
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:40,126
1985年起 我就开始研读…
I have studied the coroner's reports

878
01:05:40,204 --> 01:05:42,968
费尔沃特镇上的每一份验尸报告
of every death in Fairwater since 1985.

879
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:47,170
28宗死亡案都跟心脏病有关
Twenty-eight cases involved crushed hearts.

880
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:49,974
动脉被掐到爆裂
Arteries choked until they burst.

881
01:05:50,181 --> 01:05:53,150
从1990年你美丽的…
That started in 1990 with your

882
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:56,451
太太黛布拉开始
beautiful wife, Debra.

883
01:05:57,588 --> 01:05:59,522
她是第一个受害者
She was the first.

884
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:03,325
雷林斯基
Ray Lynskey.

885
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:06,227
你跟他吵了一架 3小时后 他就死了
You have an argument with him, three hours later, dead.

886
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:09,789
我们都知道你不喜欢麦格达瑞斯琼斯
Magda Rees-Jones, we know you didn't like her.

887
01:06:10,368 --> 01:06:12,734
洗手间那位先生呢？
But what about the guy in the toilet?

888
01:06:13,904 --> 01:06:16,099
法兰克 他有冒犯你吗？
What did he do to you, Frank?

889
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:19,702
在你的皮鞋上尿尿吗？
Piss on your Hush Puppies?

890
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:24,380
你为什么在颤抖？
Why are you shaking?

891
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,816
喔 我的天
Oh, my.

892
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:32,952
你现在又犯了 对不对？
You're doing it right now, aren't you?

893
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:37,455
你现在想把我给杀了
You're trying to kill me. Right now.

894
01:06:39,397 --> 01:06:41,388
班尼斯特 想都别想
Forget it, Bannister.

895
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:44,294
我有穿铅制背心！
I'm wearing a lead breastplate!

896
01:06:45,703 --> 01:06:49,298
镇上有28宗不解的死亡案
We have 28 unexplained deaths here.

897
01:06:49,774 --> 01:06:51,332
你猜我怎么想？
You know what I think?

898
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:55,743
我觉得你跟每一起死亡案都有关
I think you are involved in each and every one of them.

899
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:03,311
这边请
This way.

900
01:07:05,556 --> 01:07:07,023
不
No.

901
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:12,291
脱内裤？天哪 搞什么鬼？
Hey, man! Pulling your drawers off. Man, what the hell?

902
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:13,892
班尼？
Benny?

903
01:07:13,964 --> 01:07:17,297
我的老兄班尼 这是我兄弟班尼
My man, Benny! Stu, this is my boy here, Benny, man!

904
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:19,459
班尼 说真的 我是你朋友
Hey, Benny, I'm your friend, man. Seriously.

905
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:21,437
记得要用肥皂洗澡
Three words, "Shower with soap."

906
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:23,029
快点
Come on!

907
01:07:24,575 --> 01:07:25,803
- 你没事吧？
- 抽筋　　　
-Stu, you all right? -Spasm, spasm.

908
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,400
没事
It's all right.

909
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:29,838
- 法兰克！　　　
- 法兰克问题大了
-Frank.  -Frank, we got problems.

910
01:07:29,914 --> 01:07:32,178
他们要告你涉嫌重大罪行
These cats are gonna stitch you up on a capital offence.

911
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:34,274
他们要把费尔沃特镇上所有的…
These murders that have been going on in Fairwater,

912
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:35,613
谋杀案都怪到你头上
they're gonna pin 'em on you.

913
01:07:35,686 --> 01:07:39,349
我和史都华要救你出去 快来
Stu and I are gonna get you out of here, so come on, man, let's go.

914
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:41,184
法兰克？
Frank?

915
01:07:44,462 --> 01:07:47,363
- 法兰克快点啦
- 等一下　　　
-Frank! Come out of it, man. -Wait, no, wait, wait.

916
01:07:48,766 --> 01:07:51,257
喔 天哪！算了 史都华
Oh, God. Forget it, Stu.

917
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,494
看看他
Look at him.

918
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:58,038
他失去信念了
He doesn't believe any more.

919
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,305
就快好了
It won't be long now.

920
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:05,742
他快到承认阶段了
He's reached the acceptance stage.

921
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,185
面对内心的罪恶感
Grappling with his guilt.

922
01:08:10,187 --> 01:08:12,348
寻找答案
Seeking resolution.

923
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,486
迪墨探员 你要知道…
You realize, Agent Dammers,

924
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,461
我们没有任何控告他涉嫌杀人的证据
we have no forensic evidence linking him with any of the deaths.

925
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,122
没关系
Doesn't matter.

926
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:25,558
我想还没审判前 他应该就会自杀了吧
I expect this case to suicide long before it ever reaches trial.

927
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:33,474
每次都会这样
They always do.

928
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:22,282
什么梦想屋嘛
So much for the dream home.

929
01:09:23,861 --> 01:09:25,761
露西 你在这儿搞什么鬼？
What the hell are we doing here, Lucy?

930
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,525
看看这个鬼地方 乱七八糟
I mean, look at this place. It's a dump.

931
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,425
他真是个大败类
God, this guy's a loser.

932
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:34,260
喔 我的天哪 露西
Oh, my God, Lucy.

933
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:37,505
你看看
Look at this. Look at this.

934
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:41,239
露西 他耍我们 他骗了我们
He set us up, Lucy. The man set us up.

935
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:43,444
这是我们家！
This is our house!

936
01:09:44,148 --> 01:09:46,616
露西 他把我们当呆瓜看待
He took us for a couple of schmucks, Lucy.

937
01:09:46,717 --> 01:09:48,446
你看 露西
Look, Lucy, look!

938
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:25,786
完美的篮球场就这样毁了
Perfectly good basketball court gone to pot.

939
01:10:26,624 --> 01:10:28,489
我是班尼斯特
Yeah, Bannister.

940
01:10:28,759 --> 01:10:31,193
班尼斯特先生 你一定要帮我
Mr. Bannister, you've got to help me.

985
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:10,800

天哪 你以为自己是世界上…
Jesus, do you think that you're the only person

994
01:16:46,336 --> 01:16:48,531
唯一失去过亲人的人吗？
who's ever lost somebody?

995
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:51,066
你装得一副没有感情的样子…
God, you walk around like you don't have any feelings

996
01:16:51,141 --> 01:16:53,541
你只不过是害怕
but the truth is that you're just scared.

997
01:16:54,144 --> 01:16:56,840
你真的很虚伪 为什么要这样？

What was that in that cell, Frank?I felt something crushing my heart.

1028
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,612
露西 我打不过他 我也不能保护你

1029
01:20:32,293 --> 01:20:34,853
只有一个解决的方法
There's only one way to deal with this thing.

Go away, Luce. Just walk the other way.

1034
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,032
等一下
Wait.

1035
01:20:52,947 --> 01:20:56,405
这会让你的心跳减慢 体温降低
This will slow your heart rate and lower your body temperature.

1036
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:06,626
你只有20分钟
You'll have 20 minutes, max.

1037
01:21:06,694 --> 01:21:09,993
超过时间就会损害细胞
Any longer than that and there's a danger of tissue damage.

不知道我能不能把你救活…
That's only if I can successfully revive you

1040
01:21:15,202 --> 01:21:16,863
法兰克…
Frank,

1041
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:20,240
别这样
you don't have to do this.

1042
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:22,708
露西 你最好把门关起来
Lucy, better close the door.

1043
01:21:23,077 --> 01:21:24,669

1044
01:21:25,012 --> 01:21:26,741
不会太久
It won't take long.

1045
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:38,985
{\an8}冷冻中

1046
01:22:45,559 --> 01:22:49,518
林斯基医生 没想到你对低温学有研究
I didn't know you had an interest in cryogenics, Dr. Lynskey.

1047
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:53,158
- 我９点要把他救回来
- 为什么要这样做？　
-I'm reviving him at 9:00. -Why would we want to do that?

1048
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:39,769
露西
Luce.

1049
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:53,049
好了
There we go.

1050
01:24:09,143 --> 01:24:11,873
混蛋 放我走！
Let me go, you bastard. Let me go!

1051
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:15,973
混蛋 放我出去！快点让我下车！
Let me out now, you bastard! Let me out of this car now!

1052
01:25:39,633 --> 01:25:41,931
我觉得墓园…
I find cemeteries very

1053
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:45,895
是个非常宁静的地方 不是吗？
restful places, don't you?

1054
01:25:45,973 --> 01:25:49,136
快点回转 带我回去
Turn this car around and take me back.

1055
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:51,437

11点准时
In exactly 11 hours鈥?time.

1057
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,447
你这个畜生！
Son of a bitch!

1058
01:25:58,519 --> 01:25:59,986
不
No. No.

1059
01:26:09,296 --> 01:26:11,025
我认识查理
I knew Charlie.

1060
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:13,796
史霸农场 1969年

1061

I was the family's sex slave for six months.

1063
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:25,504
长达六个月…
Six months

1064
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,944
为了服务我的国家…

1065
01:26:29,016 --> 01:26:32,281
而装成肮脏的嘻皮

1066
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:43,825
我要出去！
I want out.

1067
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:52,203
让我下车！你快给我回来 大变态！
Let me out of here! Come back here, you creep!

1068
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:15,126
我全身都写着痛苦的回忆
My body is a road map of pain.

1069
01:27:17,364 --> 01:27:19,229
1974…
1974.

1070
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:23,564
路西弗的孩子

忍受了极度的痛苦

不过我不会被打倒

是有代价的

1084
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:30,526
意志力…
The power of the mind

01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,605
有绝对的力量

法兰克 是你吗？
Frank, is that you?

1088
01:28:57,131 --> 01:29:01,192
是我做的？
I'm doing this?

1089
01:29:01,635 --> 01:29:04,832
我能够用意志力开车？
I'm making the car move with the power of my mind?

1090
01:29:05,372 --> 01:29:07,033
太好了！

1091
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:08,670

给我回到地下去…
Get back in the goddamn ground

1094
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:20,145
你这个什么都不懂的灵媒白痴！
you unorganized grab-asstic gob of teleplasmic shit!

1095
01:29:34,968 --> 01:29:39,460
你是什么鬼东西？好像一副很厉害的样子
Who in the hell are you? Sound off like you've got a pair!

1096
01:29:53,086 --> 01:29:54,747
嘿 混蛋
Hey, asshole.

1097

01:30:53,016 --> 01:30:56,975
你是谁？
Who are you?

1099
01:31:04,394 --> 01:31:06,123
强尼巴特利
Johnny Bartlett.

1100
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:09,498
我以为你这种人会在地狱被火炼
I thought guys like you fried in hell.

1101
01:31:10,233 --> 01:31:12,224
法兰克 我逃出来了
I got out, Frank.

1102
01:31:14,338 --> 01:31:18,172
我这几年来都很努力 得分超过40

哈利圣克莱尔

我只想和帮我报仇的英雄握个手
I just want to shake the hand of the man who finally avenged my death.

1105
01:31:37,794 --> 01:31:39,659
你头上有号码

1106
01:31:41,465 --> 01:31:44,730
我死的时候 巴特利在我额头上刻的

1108
01:31:47,671 --> 01:31:51,129
法兰克 他大错特错了吧？
He couldn't be more wrong, could he, Frank?

1109
01:31:58,915 --> 01:32:00,507

1112
01:32:45,929 --> 01:32:50,423
法兰克 呼吸

慢慢呼吸
Breathe slowly. Breathe.

Okay. Frank.

1116
01:32:59,376 --> 01:33:01,367

1121
01:33:14,257 --> 01:33:15,986

-He's hallucinating. It'll pass. -Lucy,

1124
01:33:23,133 --> 01:33:24,862
他又在杀人

1125
01:33:25,235 --> 01:33:26,827
派翠亚

听我说 我们得逃出去

派翠亚从不出门
Patricia never leaves the house.

1131
01:34:00,337 --> 01:34:02,396
布莱德利太太 很抱歉 她非走不可
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bradley, but she's coming with me.

1132
01:34:02,472 --> 01:34:05,407
你根本搞不清状况 她是我女儿 快上楼
You have no right. She's my daughter. Get upstairs.

1133
01:34:05,475 --> 01:34:08,137
不行 不能再这样继续下去
No. Look, this is gonna stop now.

1134

你在讲什么？
What are you talking about?

1135
01:34:09,746 --> 01:34:12,772
你衣柜里怎么会有法兰克班尼斯特的刀？
Why do you have Frank Bannister's knife in your closet?

1136
01:34:12,849 --> 01:34:14,908
你进我的房间？
You went in my room?

1137
01:34:16,052 --> 01:34:17,349
妈妈
Mother.

1138
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:19,012

她马上就下来了
she'll be down in a few minutes.

1142
01:35:01,731 --> 01:35:03,892
派翠亚 我们现在就得离开
No, Patricia, we have to go now.

1143
01:35:03,967 --> 01:35:07,334
这里不安全 强尼巴特利又回来了
It's just not safe here. Johnny Bartlett's back.

1144

他晚上都会来找我

1146
01:35:18,949 --> 01:35:21,076
我不知道他为什么会来

1147
01:35:21,585 --> 01:35:23,314
他会虐待我
He torments me.

1148
01:35:24,821 --> 01:35:26,755
他为什么要来？
Why has he come?

1149
01:35:28,458 --> 01:35:30,392
我要被处罚吗？
Am I being punished?

1150
01:35:30,727 --> 01:35:33,287
派翠亚 快点 我们现在得马上离开
Patricia, please. Let's just go now, please.

1151
01:35:33,363 --> 01:35:35,558
派翠亚 我现在就想杀她

1152

这样我们就有41个
That'll give us 41.

1153
01:35:41,238 --> 01:35:42,762
比盖西还多8个
That's eight clear of Gacy.

1154
01:35:42,839 --> 01:35:45,706
再9个就能打破邦帝的纪录
Another nine and we'll have broken Bundy's record.

1155
01:35:45,842 --> 01:35:49,073
不敢想像 他知道时会有什么表情
I can't wait to see old Ted's face when he hears the news.

1156
01:35:49,312 --> 01:35:50,574
好！
Yes!

1157
01:35:50,647 --> 01:35:52,239
什么？
What?

1158

对不起
I'm sorry.

1159
01:35:56,987 --> 01:35:59,080
我们应该等妈妈的
We really should wait for Mother.

1160
01:36:01,057 --> 01:36:04,584
那个白痴灵媒今天真的很扫兴
And that asswipe psychic nearly ruined it for us tonight, Patty.

1161
01:36:06,663 --> 01:36:09,598
- 让我们出糗　　　　
- 派翠亚你不会有事的
-He made us look stupid. -You're gonna be okay, Patricia.

01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:12,260
- 一切都会平息
- 闭嘴　　　　
-Everything's going to be all right. -Shut up.

1163
01:36:12,402 --> 01:36:14,267
那个俄国食人魔到处炫耀…
That Russian cannibal creep's running around

1164
01:36:14,337 --> 01:36:16,328
说他杀了50几个人
saying he did 50 plus.

1165
01:36:17,474 --> 01:36:20,102
派翠亚 那让我们很难堪耶
That reflects badly on the both of us, Patty.

1166
01:36:22,579 --> 01:36:25,013
这记录应该由美国人来保持
This record should be held by an American.

1167
01:36:25,081 --> 01:36:26,673
我同意
I quite agree.

1168

你想要的话…
You can come

01:36:32,722 --> 01:36:34,485
可以跟我一起住
stay with me if you like.

1170
01:36:34,557 --> 01:36:36,422
宝贝 我现在就要把她杀了

1171
01:36:36,493 --> 01:36:37,960

1172
01:36:46,069 --> 01:36:48,162
我去拿外套

你这个假腥腥的婊子！
Patronizing do-gooder bitch!

1174
01:36:58,615 --> 01:37:00,276
派翠亚…
Patricia,

1175
01:37:01,384 --> 01:37:04,182
你把她杀了 我来观赏
you kill her, I'll watch.

1176
01:37:10,694 --> 01:37:12,423
准备好了？

1177

宝贝 我最喜欢你这样了
I love it when you do that, baby.

1178
01:37:38,555 --> 01:37:40,489
布莱德利太太？
Mrs. Bradley?

1179

布莱德利太太 你要跟我们一起走吗？
Mrs. Bradley, are you coming with us?

1180
01:37:50,367 --> 01:37:52,232

No, not that way!

1183
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,549

我们得拿到教堂去

01:45:29,625 --> 01:45:33,459
小子 把枪放下 警察马上要到了
Put the gun down, son. The law is on its way.

1220
01:45:34,797 --> 01:45:36,788
派翠亚 得几分了？
What's the score, Patty?

1221
01:45:41,003 --> 01:45:42,595
11分
Eleven.

1222
01:45:42,772 --> 01:45:44,865
跟史达魏德一样
That's the same as Starkweather's.

1223
01:45:48,244 --> 01:45:50,303
我们现在平手
We have a tie on our hands.

1224
01:46:24,714 --> 01:46:27,148
- 露西　
- 法兰克
-Lucy. -Frank.

1225
01:46:31,521 --> 01:46:33,113
卡住了
It's jammed.

1226
01:46:35,958 --> 01:46:39,018
- 快拿去快点
- 好　　　　
-Take it. Just take it. -Right.

1227
01:46:40,263 --> 01:46:42,561
我马上就回来 不要乱跑
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

1228
01:46:42,632 --> 01:46:44,099
不
No.

1229
01:47:09,258 --> 01:47:11,852
- 还给我　
- 让我来猜
-Give that to me. -Let me guess.

1230
01:47:12,728 --> 01:47:15,925
你得把这些骨灰放在神圣的地方…
You have to get these ashes to consecrated ground

1231
01:47:15,998 --> 01:47:19,058
才能把邪灵赶走
in order to destroy the forces of evil.

1232
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,193
把骨灰瓮给我！
Give me the goddamn urn, Dammers!

1233
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:25,707
这些骨灰绝对不能曝光
Under no circumstances must these ashes ever be released.

1234
01:47:27,076 --> 01:47:28,600
不！
No!

1235
01:47:33,983 --> 01:47:36,383
你真是不懂事情的严重性
You have no idea what you've just done.

1236
01:47:38,187 --> 01:47:41,384
法兰克 你根本就不懂吧？
You just don't get it, do you, Frank?

1237
01:47:45,094 --> 01:47:47,824
你心理明明就有病 所以才会把…
Your pathological mindset had made it necessary

1238
01:47:47,897 --> 01:47:51,333
自己的缺陷看成…
for you to interpret your sad, personal inadequacies

1239
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,425
正义与邪恶之间的搏斗…
as a grand struggle between good and evil

1240
01:47:53,502 --> 01:47:57,268
这一切都是为了让你自己得到安慰
in order to gratify your pathetic need for self-glorification.

1241
01:48:02,845 --> 01:48:04,779
你真是个混蛋
You are such an asshole.

1242
01:48:06,882 --> 01:48:09,851
没错 我是带有鸟兹冲锋枪的…
Yes, I am. I'm an asshole

1243
01:48:10,519 --> 01:48:12,043
混蛋
with an Uzi.

1244
01:48:13,689 --> 01:48:15,281
起来！
Get up!

1245
01:48:15,591 --> 01:48:17,855
真令人觉得恶心！快起来！
You make me sick! Get up!

1246
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,121
转身 我不想从背后对你开枪
Turn around. I don't want to shoot you in the back.

1247
01:48:20,196 --> 01:48:22,528
转身！给我快转身！
Turn around! I said, turn around!

1248
01:48:23,899 --> 01:48:25,799
我以美国政府的名义…
As an agent of the United States Government

1249
01:48:25,868 --> 01:48:28,132
命令你立刻转身
I am ordering you to turn around.

1250
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:49,051
法兰克！
Frank!

1251
01:49:06,075 --> 01:49:09,101
求求你不要伤害我
Please! Please don't hurt me. Stop!

1252
01:49:24,794 --> 01:49:26,318
拜托
Please!

1253
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:45,841
法兰克！
Frank!

1254
01:49:46,749 --> 01:49:48,876
喔 我的天哪 法兰克
Oh, my God. Frank.

1255
01:50:04,233 --> 01:50:05,825
黛比拉
Debra.

1256
01:50:26,422 --> 01:50:28,083
你杀了她
You killed her.

1257
01:50:31,427 --> 01:50:33,361
老兄 你是下一位
You're next, pal.

1258
01:50:36,766 --> 01:50:38,700
宝贝 把他杀了
Take him out, baby.

1259
01:50:49,078 --> 01:50:50,943
不！快动手！
No! Get him!

1260
01:50:52,381 --> 01:50:54,110
不！住手！
No! Stop!

1261
01:50:57,219 --> 01:50:58,880
法兰克！
Frank!

1262
01:51:01,757 --> 01:51:03,281
不！
No!

1263
01:51:06,629 --> 01:51:08,494
派翠亚 快点
Get him, Patty.

1264
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,665
太好了 宝贝
Yeah, baby.

1265
01:51:33,589 --> 01:51:35,819
你真有天分
Oh, baby, you are an artist.

1266
01:51:37,726 --> 01:51:39,717
- 而且很漂亮
- 不！　　　
-You're pretty, too. -No!

1267
01:51:45,267 --> 01:51:46,734
不
No.

1268
01:51:51,473 --> 01:51:53,134
这样才对
Yes.

1269
01:52:02,718 --> 01:52:05,243
我想来解剖小动物
I'm in the mood for a little vivisection.

1270
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:06,845
不！
No! Oh, please.

1271
01:52:07,089 --> 01:52:08,681
我也是
Me, too.

1272
01:52:15,064 --> 01:52:16,463
你这个婊子！
You bitch!

1273
01:52:16,532 --> 01:52:18,432
不！
No!

1274
01:52:22,972 --> 01:52:25,372
强尼 我抓到你的女朋友了！
I got your girlfriend, Johnny!

1275
01:52:25,875 --> 01:52:29,242
- 快点来救她啊！
- 该死！放开她！
-Come and get her! -No, goddamn you! Let go of her!

1276
01:52:29,311 --> 01:52:31,074
- 强尼！　　　　　　
- 快点来救她胆小鬼！
-Johnny! -Come and get her, you coward!

1277
01:52:31,146 --> 01:52:33,341
- 快来救她！
- 不！　　　
-Come on and get her! -No!

1278
01:52:33,749 --> 01:52:35,614
放开派翠亚！
Let go off my Patty!

1279
01:52:39,088 --> 01:52:40,749
派翠亚！
Patty!

1280
01:52:46,795 --> 01:52:48,387
强尼！
Johnny!

1281
01:53:01,644 --> 01:53:03,578
过来 抓紧我的手
Come here. Give me your hand.

1282
01:53:11,053 --> 01:53:13,988
法兰克 再见 你死定了
See you later, Frank. We got you.

1283
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:17,754
我们要去杀人！
We're going back down to get us some more!

1284
01:53:18,427 --> 01:53:20,019
法兰克
Yo, Frank.

1285
01:53:22,665 --> 01:53:24,326
还好吧？
How's it going?

1286
01:53:27,202 --> 01:53:29,067
拜拜 法兰克
Bye, Frank.

1287
01:53:32,141 --> 01:53:33,665
强尼
Johnny.

1288
01:53:34,843 --> 01:53:36,037
- 法兰克后退
- 对　　　　
-Step back, Frank. -Yeah.

1289
01:53:36,111 --> 01:53:38,136
应该会蛮惨不忍睹的
This isn't going to be pleasant.

1290
01:54:09,945 --> 01:54:13,904
通往地狱的直达公车不需排队 不需等待
The old express bus to hell. No lines, no waiting.

1291
01:54:24,793 --> 01:54:26,818
很不可思议吧？
It's really something, isn't it?

1292
01:54:26,962 --> 01:54:28,827
最棒的图书馆
Excellent libraries.

1293
01:54:29,164 --> 01:54:31,029
最高级的雪茄
Premium cigars.

1294
01:54:31,266 --> 01:54:34,497
还有辣美眉
And of course, the honeys.

1295
01:54:34,937 --> 01:54:38,498
不错吧？史佬在这儿可是美眉杀手
Yeah, how about that? Stu's a regular chick magnet up here.

1296
01:54:44,747 --> 01:54:46,612
法兰克 你好
Hello, Frank.

1297
01:54:48,617 --> 01:54:50,380
该回家了
It's time to go home.

1298
01:54:51,653 --> 01:54:53,518
我已经到家了
I am home.

1299
01:54:54,757 --> 01:54:55,917
错
No.

1300
01:54:55,991 --> 01:54:58,391
官方机构告诉我们…
You see, the authorities have informed us

1301
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:00,690
你的时候还没到
that it's just not your time.

1302
01:55:02,364 --> 01:55:04,298
老兄 享受生命吧
Start living, dude.

1303
01:55:10,305 --> 01:55:11,966
开心一点
Be happy.

1304
01:55:28,424 --> 01:55:30,085
法兰克！
Frank!

1305
01:56:08,697 --> 01:56:10,426
我得告诉你一件事
There's something I have to tell you.

1306
01:56:10,499 --> 01:56:12,091
什么？
Yeah?

1307
01:56:19,708 --> 01:56:22,734
- 不好意思打扰你们
- 没关系华特　　　
-Sorry to interrupt you, folks. -It's all right, Walt.

1308
01:56:25,581 --> 01:56:28,948
法兰克 你对碟仙有多少了解？
Frank, what do you know about Ouija boards?

1309
01:56:29,017 --> 01:56:30,245
不太懂
Not a lot.

1310
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:32,947
我在布莱德利家找到一大叠
I found a whole stack of them up at the Bradley house.

1311
01:56:33,021 --> 01:56:35,854
看来派翠亚5年前出狱时…
It looks like Patricia just got herself a direct line

1312
01:56:35,924 --> 01:56:38,984
就跟死去的男友连上了线
to her dead boyfriend as soon as she was released five years ago.

1313
01:56:39,061 --> 01:56:40,688
听说老太太…
It seems like the old lady,

1314
01:56:40,762 --> 01:56:43,390
知道派翠亚涉嫌杀害你太太之后…
when she caught wind of Patricia's involvement in,

1315
01:56:45,367 --> 01:56:49,201
就对派翠亚下迷幻药
well, in your wife's death, that she just kept the girl sedated.

1316
01:56:49,538 --> 01:56:51,870
不过她阻止不了巴特利
She just couldn't stop Bartlett, though.

1317
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:55,670
华特 这个结局还不错 叙述得很精彩
Nice epilogue, Walt. It was well delivered.

1318
01:56:56,111 --> 01:56:57,703
法兰克
Frank.

1319
01:56:59,014 --> 01:57:01,107
还有一件事
Just one other little thing. Uh-huh.

1320
01:57:01,183 --> 01:57:04,550
我马上就要开始休长假了…
I got a whole bucket load of vacation time coming to me

1321
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:06,747
不知道我们…
and I thought. .. Good.

1322
01:57:06,822 --> 01:57:09,518
能不能一起编写有关这件事的书
...I thought you and I could collaborate on a book about all this.

1323
01:57:09,591 --> 01:57:11,456
说不定我就可以退休了
It could be my ticket off the force.

1324
01:57:11,527 --> 01:57:12,824
我不太会写作
That's not really my area.

1325
01:57:12,895 --> 01:57:14,328
要是需要找人合作…
If you're looking for a collaborator

1326
01:57:14,396 --> 01:57:16,796
何不请你的护身天使帮忙？
how about your guardian angel over there?

1327
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:27,334
- 法兰克我被你耍了
- 没错华特　　　　
-You got me, Frank. -I got you, Walt.

1328
01:57:27,409 --> 01:57:29,343
{\an8}警长-费尔沃特镇

1329
01:57:31,246 --> 01:57:33,908
法兰克 改天见
I'll see you, Frank. Bye-bye.

1330
01:57:38,554 --> 01:57:40,852
他看起来好像真的很不爽
Boy, that Dammers, he sure looks pissed.

1331
01:57:40,923 --> 01:57:42,447
是啊
Yeah.

1332
01:57:44,726 --> 01:57:46,318
法兰克 有时候…
Well, sometimes, Frank, you see

1333
01:57:46,395 --> 01:57:48,420
在一场大浩劫之后…
when you go through a traumatic experience

1334
01:57:48,497 --> 01:57:50,624
人的想法会有所改变
it kind of alters your perception.

1335
01:57:53,001 --> 01:57:54,593
别闹了
No.
