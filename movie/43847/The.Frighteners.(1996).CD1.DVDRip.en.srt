00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,102
Get off me!

5
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,231
Oh, please.

6
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,734
Please, don't hurt me.

7
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,115
lt's wrong! She's too young!

8
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,910
The sins of the flesh will ruin her.

9
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,791
Please don't hurt me!

10
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,459
Please!

11
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,525
The wicked will be punished.

00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,910
""The mystery heart condition that has
killed over 20 people in 4 years...

13
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,703
has claimed another victim.

14
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,749
Doctors are baffled as to why
fit and healthy people...

15
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,251
are suffering massive heart attacks.

16
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,880
Many residents claim that
the 'Shadow of Death'...

17
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,216
has again descended on the town.''

18
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,510
""Shadow of Death""?
l don't like it.

19
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,639
That's what they're saying.
People are scared out there.

20
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,185
""For decades, Fairwater
has been linked with death...

21
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,314
following the 1964
Bradley-Bartlett murder spree.

22
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,026
Thirty years later,
as the death toll steadily rises...

23
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,238
it appears the Grim Reaper
has once again returned...

24
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,074
to the quiet streets of Fairwater.''

25
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,202
Oh, no. Steve, no.

26
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,748
l asked for a new angle.
Give me something fresh.

27
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,211
l want to see the human face of
this tragedy. Talk to the families.

28
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,256
How has this affected
the local community?

29
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,008
Yes, Miss Rees-Jones.

30
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,426
And, Steve....

31
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,429
no more references
to death as a person.

32
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,639
Friend of the family?
Really such a shame.

33
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,275
Go on. Get out. Go on.

34
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,819
Get out!

35
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,871
Damn.

36
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,513
Oh, my God!

37
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,558
Oh, my God!

38
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,729
l don't believe this.
This is not happening. My lawn!

39
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,397
You ruptured my lawn!

40
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,402
Hey, how you doing?

41
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,573
Give me a call.
l'll pay for the damages.

42
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,825
You're damn right! l'm suing your ass!

43
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,745
Don't get litigious. Send me a bill.

44
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,748
""Frank Bannister, Psychic lnvestigator""?

45
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,250
So why didn't you see
the corner coming?

46
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,920
You stupid moron!
This is goddamn bullshit!

47
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,048
This will cost you big time!

48
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,799
You're paying for a new fence!

49
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,387
l want this lawn
completely resurfaced!

50
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,848
Budzo!

51
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,392
My Budzo! My Budzo!

52
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,271
l got your license plate number!
You bastard!

53
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,921
This is private property.

54
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,467
Mrs. Bradley? l'm Dr. Lynskey.
l work at the medical center.

55
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,969
You do not.
l know who works there.

56
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,263
l started 2 months ago.

57
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,599
Dr. Kamins is my physician.

58
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,604
He's attending a funeral.
l'm seeing his patients today.

59
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,111
She was cutting vegetables.
The knife slipped.

60
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,156
She just needs a few stitches.
l'll drive you to the clinic.

61
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,283
That's impossible.

62
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:14,786
lt's a deep cut.

63
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,162
Leave us antibiotics.

64
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
Mother, please.

65
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,166
Patricia never leaves the house.

66
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,961
But it hurts.

67
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,963
To your room this instant!

68
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,969
Wait. Just a minute.

69
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,808
Who did that to you?

70
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,022
l think you'd better go now,
Dr. Lynskey.

71
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,196
You don't know
who my daughter is, do you?

72
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,657
Patricia's not to be trusted.

73
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,034
l beg your pardon?

74
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,370
l can have her locked up
anytime l want.

75
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,545
They said she was
an accessory after the fact.

76
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,839
l know the truth.

77
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,385
lt was cold-blooded murder.

78
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,032
ln the space of 27
blood-soaked minutes...

79
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,204
12 innocent people were shot by
hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett.

80
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,082
Patients, medical staff, visitors...

81
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:47,170
no one was spared in this rampage
through Fairwater Sanatorium.

82
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,381
Not even the hospital chapel...

83
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,843
provided sanctuary, as those in prayer
were shot on their knees.

84
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,388
We're reporters.
We have to get the news!

85
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,182
A seemingly senseless crime...

86
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,936
Bartlett's motive
remains a mystery to this day.

87
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,604
Johnny Bartlett.

88
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,565
He's got a demonic look
on his face.

89
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,776
Any comments, Johnny?

90
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,280
Got me a score of 12, sir.
That's one more than Starkweather.

91
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,118
Six years earlier,
Charles Starkweather had murdered...

92
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,079
eleven people
in a Nebraska killing spree.

93
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,124
Guess that makes me
public enemy number one!

94
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,668
Fifteen-year-old
Patricia Anne Bradley...

95
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,212
daughter of
the hospital administrator...

96
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,132
was also implicated in the killings.

97
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,093
She was madly in love
with the psychopath Bartlett.

98
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,469
That's her!

99
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,599
l was in her house this afternoon.

100
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:50,150
Terrific. We're in town 2 months and
you've befriended the Manson family.

101
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,071
2200 volts of electricity...

102
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,992
ended the life of Johnny Bartlett,
the unrepentant killer.

103
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,578
As they threw the switch,
he screamed:

104
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,998
""l got me a score of twelve.
Beat that.""

105
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,005
ln what some considered
a miscarriage of justice...

106
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,133
Patricia Bradley was sentenced
to life imprisonment...

107
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,179
although it was never proven
she participated in the killings.

108
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,515
Five years ago,
Patricia Bradley was granted...

109
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,101
a conditional release
by the governor.

110
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,814
Today she lives a reclusive life
back in the family home--

111
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,151
Should have fried her
along with Bartlett.

112
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,864
She was fifteen years old.
She fell in love with the wrong guy.

113
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,532
Could happen to anyone.

114
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,161
Sweetie, don't go back there.
Place gives me the creeps.

115
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,288
l don't think--

116
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,543
Come on, honey.

117
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,717
l think tiger's
getting a little lonely.

118
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,650
What the hell is this doing here?

119
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,696
l thought l tore this up.

120
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,240
- Did he come back here?
- Who?

121
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,659
The moron who tore up my fence!

122
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,586
Help!

123
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,422
- Help!
- He's alive.

124
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,050
Ray, get me off!

125
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,573
You... sick... thing!

126
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,954
Lucy, l don't want
that con man in my house!

127
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,419
There has to be some kind
of rational explanation for this.

128
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,630
Ray! We have got a poltergeist!

129
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,967
lt's nothing the police can't handle.

130
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,475
Bannister.

131
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,604
Dr. Lynskey, l'm on my way.

132
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,409
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.

133
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,120
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

134
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,082
The activity is located where?

135
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,503
l don't know. lt went quiet
about 5 minutes ago.

136
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,838
Went quiet?

137
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,592
The dining room table spun
in a counterclockwise direction?

138
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,969
l don't think that happened.

139
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,641
The toilet seat lid
banged up and down?

140
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,646
- Did the bed levitate?
- Yeah. With me on it.

141
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,359
Spontaneous recurrent psychokinesis.
Oh, boy.

142
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,155
This could be the worst case
l've ever seen. lt's bad.

143
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,829
Well, l can do a clearance,
but it's not going to be cheap.

144
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,997
l do offer a six-month guarantee.

145
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,207
How much?

146
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,002
249.95.

147
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,673
And there is a 20% surcharge for making
a house call after midnight.

148
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,675
And there's vehicle, gas.

149
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,436
We could forget about the fence,
call it even.

150
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:05,030
Stand back, ma'am. l don't want you
to have to sign a waiver.

151
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,033
Plus, a hundred bucks
for materials.

152
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,535
Just do it, for Christ's sake.

153
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,371
Here we go.

154
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,254
Why us? Why are they in our house?

155
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,883
Emanations are normally confined
to the cemetery...

156
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,176
although they do escape.

157
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,594
Usually young ones.

158
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,846
Oh, for God's sake, come on.

159
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,932
Come on.

160
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,107
lt's holy water.

161
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,790
This is bullshit.
This is total bullshit.

162
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,085
Come on, come on, come on.

163
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,753
Yes!

164
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,633
Okay, these belong to you.

165
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,427
Six ectoplasmic emanations.

166
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,263
Don't worry. They can't escape.

167
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,766
Some people like a souvenir.

168
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:20,105
l really don't think we want
to keep those. Thank you. Do we, hon?

169
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,273
l could give a rat's ass.

170
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,609
Okay, we'll just--

171
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:32,951
They can't feel a thing.
At least that's what the book says.

172
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,995
You never know for sure.

173
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,500
All right. Thank you, Bannister.
You can go.

174
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,797
What are you staring at?

175
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,843
What's with the number?

176
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,012
What number?

177
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,308
lf you're trying to freak me out,
it's not working.

178
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,021
He's just trying to get
more money out of us.

179
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,691
Get your shit and get
the hell out of my house.

180
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,026
Come on.

181
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,861
Move!

182
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,157
Thank you so much.

183
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,330
There you go.

184
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,082
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

185
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,045
Why must you always
alienate everybody?

186
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,697
l think l'm going to throw up.

187
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,408
Damn.

188
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,099
l hate that trunk!

189
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:23,061
l don't want ectoplasmic muck
all over my car seats.

190
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,272
The ectoplasm is the only thing
sticky enough...

191
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,566
to hold the damn car together.

192
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,530
l'm sorry about your shit Volvo,
but we won't ride in the trunk no more.

193
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,950
We could like to cruise
with some style, man.

194
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,077
You two left me high and dry.

195
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:43,415
l get to the house, nothing's
happening. l couldn't believe it.

196
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,751
Hey, Stuart-- in or out.

197
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,257
Not even a banging toilet lid.
l looked like a asshole.

198
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,802
We strained our backs
lifting that heavy-ass bed.

199
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,973
Oh, yeah. What idiot put the number
on the guy's forehead?

200
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,810
lt wasn't funny.

201
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,814
Start pulling your weight,
or it's back to the cemetery.

202
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:12,318
Pull this, Frank. l'm about
to go like Jesse on your ass.

203
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,281
l'm going to find some other
black ghosts and organize a march.

204
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:20,785
The African-American
Apparition Coalition. The AAAC.

205
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,620
l'll tell you something.

206
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:27,083
Nothing's worse than some pissed-off
brothers that's already dead!

207
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:42,474
Therefore, a happy ghost
is a productive ghost.

208
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,603
To that end, l've drawn up
a list of suggestions.

209
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:51,649
Bear in mind, we have given you
five years of loyal service.

210
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,696
Flies. That's what
you've given me, flies.

211
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,158
Why do flies stick to you guys
like shit to a blanket?

212
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,327
Very funny. You're a funny guy.

213
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,830
You only think about yourself.
l could complain, too.

214
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:10,335
l need some new clothes. l still look
like Linc from ""The Mod Squad"".

215
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,671
You died in the '70s. Bummer.

216
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,556
Now, Frank,
we got to talk about cigars.

217
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,850
You promised to buy me a box.

218
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,396
l hate to tell you,
but you're dead. You can't smoke.

219
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,232
Light one and blow the smoke
in my face.

220
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,026
lf l light a cigar,
l'll blow my lunch in your face.

221
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,365
Everybody, get down!
Damn it, Judge!

222
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,039
Put the shooters away!

223
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,341
That was a head shot!
He could have killed me!

224
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:03,054
lf l wanted to get shot at every day,
l'd move to Los Angeles!

225
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,816
When a man's jawbone drops off...

226
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,486
it's time to reassess the situation.

227
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,949
l got myself...

228
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:27,787
a nice little grave
up there at the cemetery.

229
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,500
lt could soon be time
to lay my bones.

230
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:36,588
You're my go-to guy.
Without you, l'm out of business.

231
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,506
Frightening...

232
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,344
that's a young man's game, Frank.

233
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,597
l ain't got no more hauntings
left in me.

234
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,724
What? You're in...

235
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,768
great shape.

236
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,978
My joints are getting powdery.

237
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:56,983
The dog is running away with my face.
Hell, l'm falling apart.

238
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,319
You have been for years.

239
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,368
Don't say nothing to the boys, but...

240
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:10,705
my ectoplasm is all dried up.

241
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,833
l'm sorry to hear that, Judge.

242
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,462
Give it up, Frank.

243
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:20,006
Death ain't no way
to make a living.

244
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,758
l have to finish this house.

245
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,553
You'll never finish this house!
You'll never finish nothing!

246
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,515
You're fooling yourself, Frank!

247
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,065
Too many skeletons in the closet.

248
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,569
Okay, this is it.
We got to be hard.

249
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:46,449
We go in like Charles Bronson.
We don't stop till the screaming starts.

250
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,076
l'm with you.

251
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,078
Let's go.

252
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,542
Yeah. Let's kick some ass.

253
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,877
Here we go.
One, two, three.

254
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:02,090
Good morning,
my darlings. Hello.

255
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,884
The mail is on the table,
Mrs. Waterhouse.

256
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,264
Sylvia, Mother is coming for lunch.
Pick up. Quick.

257
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,601
Big kiss.

258
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:17,272
Quit jumping around like a baby.
This is serious.

259
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:22,277
We're going to scare the living
daylights out of your parents.

260
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,405
- Will you help us out?
- Are you with us?

261
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,951
See? He gets it.
The kids always get it.

262
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,286
Let's go.

263
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,795
Mrs. Waterhouse.

264
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,800
Mrs. Waterhouse!

265
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,054
Damn. Here, man.
This one did le poo-poo.

266
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,765
- Get it away from me.
- Oh, man, it smells.

267
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,224
Mrs. Waterhouse!

268
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,688
My babies!

269
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,115
Frank Bannister.

270
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,620
l'm on my way.

271
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,963
Persistent residue of the departed.
Always a problem this time of year.

272
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:29,135
Frank Bannister. l believe you called.
Not a minute too soon.

273
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:30,929
- Frank, she--
- Shut up.

274
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,306
Frank, it's no use.

275
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:34,766
This is bad.

276
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,520
Recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis.

277
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:42,023
This could be the worst case
l have ever...

278
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,610
seen.

279
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,951
l apologize for calling you,
Mr. Bannister. Please leave.

280
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,664
What are you doing to me?

281
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,959
Preying on the bereaved
is as low as you can go.

282
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,962
You're a parasite.
People should be warned.

283
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:07,215
l've a right to offer
my services to the public.

284
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:11,052
ln case you haven't noticed,
we are having a major health crisis.

285
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:15,056
The last thing the people here need
is a two-bit charlatan...

286
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:18,476
passing on bogus messages
from the other side.

287
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,854
Now, if you will excuse me.

288
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,192
l'm just trying to make a living.

289
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:31,197
Living? Not a word you'd know
a lot about, is it, Mr. Bannister?

290
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,369
Hey, easy.

291
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,044
You all right, buddy?

292
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,504
That was quite a fall.

293
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:28,880
Bannister!

294
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,050
You have to help.
They're going to bury me.

295
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:36,221
You have to help.
What is happening to me?

296
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,014
You appear to be dead, Ray.

297
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:41,226
That's impossible.
l'm in the prime of my life.

298
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,603
l work out.
My wife's a doctor!

299
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:46,356
- Why didn't you take the corridor?
- What corridor?

300
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,942
The passageway to the other side.

301
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:53,571
Because l don't belong there!
Jesus Christ, l'm only 29!

302
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,996
Just relax, all right?
Tell me what happened.

303
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,665
l was on the rowing machine.

304
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:07,585
Suddenly, l felt this vice-like grip
squeezing my heart...

305
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:11,840
and l couldn't breathe, Frank,
l just couldn't breathe.

306
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:16,011
l have the shakes.
l need some vitamin B.

307
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,471
You can't take vitamins anymore.

308
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:23,143
You don't eat, drink or go to
the bathroom. All that's over with.

309
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:30,066
ln a year, you'll get another chance
for the other side, to be a pure spirit.

310
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,736
ln the meantime,
you're an earthbound emanation...

311
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:37,824
a rotting cloud of bioplasmic
particles, dripping ectoplasm.

312
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,499
Relax, Ray.

313
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,213
All right, Bannister.

314
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,217
Can you give me a ride
so l don't miss my funeral?

315
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,024
Don't worry.
They won't hurt you.

316
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:17,781
What in the hell is going on out here?
Get back in your graves!

317
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,407
Son of a--

318
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,744
Holy Jesus.
Frank Bannister!

319
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,871
Go ahead. l'll handle this.

320
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:32,545
What are you doing in my graveyard?
You have been told to stay away!

321
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,673
Sound off like you have a pair!

322
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,091
lt's a public place, Hiles.

323
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,509
l do not like you!

324
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,555
Do not bring your spooks in here
without permission. Disappear, scumbag!

325
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,695
l am not one of your shitty
little emanations!

326
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,198
You cannot push spirits around!
You are scum!

327
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:05,745
Using spooks to put the frighteners on
people! That makes me physically ill!

328
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,249
We have a lot of lowlifes around here!

329
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:13,128
l will provide an armed response
at any sign of trouble!

330
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,839
They must be contained!

331
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,264
Catch you later, Hiles.

332
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,308
My tour of duty
runs another 85 years!

333
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:31,146
There's a piece of dirt here
with your name on it.

334
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,315
l'm waiting for you,
you little maggot!

335
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:37,652
There were times
when people accused Ray...

336
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:42,699
of being less than generous,
but l am sure that deep down...

337
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:47,287
the man possessed a heart of gold
and a generous spirit.

338
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:53,793
lt's true. He wouldn't lie,
not at a time like this.

339
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,799
Because God has chosen...

340
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:05,930
to call Ray from this life to Himself,
we commit his body to the ground.

341
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:08,767
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

342
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,477
Jesus, what a waste.

343
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,813
lt's a goddamn tragedy!

344
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,027
Good-bye, Ray.

345
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,661
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry.

346
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,247
Oh, shit!

347
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,563
Hey, Frank!

348
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,567
l know you can hear me!

349
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,861
Get me out of this hole!

350
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,364
Frank! Get me out!

351
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,074
Hiya, Frank.

352
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,576
Hi, Walt.

353
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:11,913
l'm surprised to see you.
Here on business?

354
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,331
Not exactly.

355
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,625
They're going to bury me alive!

356
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:20,380
l hear you and Lynskey had a little
run-in the night before he died.

357
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,550
Apart from his wife...

358
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:27,095
you were the last person
to see him alive.

359
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,055
You're the one here on business.

360
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:35,437
No. The FBl is very concerned
about these deaths.

361
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,355
They look like heart attacks...

362
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:41,109
but when they slice these people open,
their arteries are...

363
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:42,944
clean as a whistle.

364
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:46,698
But there's been tremendous pressure
on the heart...

365
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,325
like the life's been
crushed out of it.

366
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:51,953
You got any theories?

367
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:54,664
Bannister!

368
00:31:56,458 --> 00:32:00,128
You mind if l pay my last respects
before they fill him in?

369
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,256
Yeah. l'm sorry.

370
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,635
Bannister!

371
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,138
Please.

372
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,781
Mr. Bannister.

373
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:33,411
Did you want to see me?

374
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,331
My God, Frank, she can see me!

375
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,962
l thought perhaps you
might have a message from Ray.

376
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,841
Tell her. Tell her l'm here, Frank.
Tell her.

377
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:50,929
Everyone says you're a fraud,
but l've seen what you can do.

378
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,349
Frank!

379
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,690
You must think l'm very stupid.
Excuse me.

380
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,443
Lucy.

381
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,155
Ray says he loves you very much.

382
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,835
Here is your table.

383
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,921
- Hi.
- Hi.

384
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,844
ls Ray with us?

385
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,099
Tell her she looks great.

386
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,229
He, uh, he says you look great.

387
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:48,570
Tell her they're from me.

388
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,447
Those are from Ray.

389
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,991
lt's our anniversary.

390
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,452
He says it's your anniversary.

391
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:59,247
ls-- ls Ray beside me?

392
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:06,755
Greetings.

393
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:10,592
How are you this evening?
May l offer you some wine?

394
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:14,346
Lucy, do you want some?
What-- red, white?

395
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:16,806
Red. We always have red.

396
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,725
White.

397
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:19,809
l've never liked red.

398
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:21,936
Lucy!

399
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,651
So you used to be an architect?

400
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:29,944
Long time ago.

401
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,655
Can it. She doesn't want
to hear your life story.

402
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:35,867
Wow. So, did you
build your own house?

403
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,660
ls it your dream home?

404
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,704
You could call it that.

405
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,999
l'll build you a dream home
once l get on my feet.

406
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,545
Why is it you can see Ray
and l can't?

407
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:52,217
l was in an accident.
lt was a car accident.

408
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,512
About five years ago.

409
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,517
They say that...

410
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:04,896
sometimes when you have
a traumatic experience...

411
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,066
it can alter your perception.

412
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,403
So after that,
you could just see spirits?

413
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:14,030
l mean, what happened?

414
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:19,411
How about you talk to Ray?
That's why l'm here.

415
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:22,414
Finally, l'm in the conversation.
Terrific.

416
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:26,751
l do have an important question
l have to ask Ray.

417
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:28,586
He can hear you.

418
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:34,092
Ray...

419
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:38,221
l really need to know
where you invested my money.

420
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:42,267
The $16,000 that l had saved.

421
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,728
The attorneys can't find it.

422
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,606
Oh, shit! l blew it
on a bad investment.

423
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,401
Don't tell her that.
Let me think.

424
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,403
lt's gone.
Lucy, it's gone.

425
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,238
Blown on a bad investment.

426
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,781
You asshole!

427
00:35:57,115 --> 00:36:01,578
Tell her l'll look out for her.
l'll move back into the house.

428
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,705
That's not a good idea.

429
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:05,915
This doesn't concern you.

430
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:07,584
What's Ray saying?

431
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,586
He left. Ray left.

432
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:13,590
He said he's sorry, but you
should get on with your life.

433
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:16,092
Bannister, l'm going to kill you!

434
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:21,097
l can't believe it. That's just like
Ray to just take the money and run.

435
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:29,439
Ray and l haven't been honest with each
other in a long time, Mr. Bannister.

436
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,653
lt wasn't what you would call
a good marriage.

437
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:37,781
You bitch!

438
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:46,790
lt'll be okay.

439
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:48,625
Hands off my wife!

440
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:50,835
Goddamn it!

441
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,338
Sorry.

442
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:58,802
l can move shit, Bannister.
You better watch your back.

443
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,846
l better clean this up.

444
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,473
Be right back.

445
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,162
Good food, huh?

446
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:30,166
Yeah... it's great.

447
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:00,131
Mom!

448
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,330
Looks like another heart attack.
Can't confirm it till the autopsy.

449
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:33,665
Damn.

450
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:38,628
A waiter saw a guy exit the john
right before the body was found.

451
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:40,463
And who was that?

452
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:44,968
Frank Bannister, pale and shaking.
The waiter thought he was sick.

453
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:46,511
Damn.

454
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,180
Hi, Lucy.

455
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:54,185
Dr. Lynskey works for me.
We're colleagues.

456
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,479
She's a material witness.

457
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:08,366
Bannister was last seen
in the restaurant parking lot.

458
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,326
He took off at high speed.

459
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,332
Bring him in.

460
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:23,798
Look at that!

461
00:40:56,414 --> 00:41:00,585
So your dead husband
was having dinner with you?

462
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,090
What did he order?

463
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:13,556
Oh, God. Excuse me.

464
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:31,950
Timmy, front desk, please.

465
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:34,369
Thank you.

466
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:39,249
Lucy, this is Special Agent
Milton Dammers of the FBl.

467
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:50,969
l came by train. l planned to fly,
but l didn't feel good about the plane.

468
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,804
At what time...

469
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:56,558
precisely, did Bannister
leave for the bathroom?

470
00:41:58,643 --> 00:41:59,728
You.

471
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,439
l'm not sure...

472
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:04,107
precisely.

473
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:07,110
Did he use
excessive amounts of salt?

474
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,070
Answer the question.

475
00:42:09,654 --> 00:42:11,948
For Christ's sake,
it's really late!

476
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:13,324
l don't remember!

477
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:21,499
What is this?

478
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,669
Excuse me, Lucy.
l'll be right back.

479
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:30,050
Milton--

480
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:34,679
Sorry, Sheriff.

481
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:37,974
l have a problem
with women yelling.

482
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,643
Can l get you anything?

483
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:42,812
Sheriff Perry!

484
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,815
You are violating
my territorial bubble.

485
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,329
Lucy, you're still grieving.

486
00:42:59,704 --> 00:43:03,458
lt would be easy for a man
like Frank to take advantage.

487
00:43:04,876 --> 00:43:06,836
You have such closed minds.

488
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:08,129
l object!

489
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:13,885
Special Agent Dammers has over...

490
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:17,138
20 years' experience
in the area of...

491
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:19,516
paranormal psychology.

492
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:22,185
Much of that was spent undercover...

493
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,895
with various...

494
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:26,690
cults and sects.

495
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,943
l get all the fruity cases,
Mrs. Lynskey.

496
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:33,613
For God's sake, Milton,
come in and sit down.

497
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,573
l'm more comfortable standing.

498
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:37,867
What has this to do with Frank?

499
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:41,287
Mrs. Lynskey, you know
nothing about Frank Bannister.

500
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,707
You claim
he's a bona fide psychic...

501
00:43:43,748 --> 00:43:46,584
yet all l have heard
is ill-informed, meandering waffle.

502
00:43:48,461 --> 00:43:51,131
On the third day of July 1990...

503
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:54,801
Frank Bannister,
then a successful architect...

504
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:58,138
was overseeing construction
of his new home.

505
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:00,473
The contractor...

506
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:02,267
Jacob Platz...

507
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,980
would later confirm that Bannister
was consuming alcohol that morning.

508
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:09,399
12:22 P.M.

509
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:14,112
Platz sees Bannister
arguing with his wife, Debra.

510
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:17,991
lt appears he had
promised Debra a garden...

511
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:23,329
and then, without consulting her,
laid a 4-inch thick concrete slab...

512
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:26,499
creating a basketball court
for himself.

513
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:29,627
12:23 P.M.

514
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,840
Platz watches the couple drive away.

515
00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:39,679
Bannister kept a tool box
in the back of his car.

516
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,973
ln it was a utility knife...

517
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:43,975
with a retractable blade.

518
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:47,687
Bannister purchased seven...

519
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:51,024
new blades that morning...

520
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:55,028
at Jesson's Hardware Store
and Building Supply...

521
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:58,698
on Third and Garrett--
Third and Garrett.

522
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,658
Third of July.

523
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,994
Seven blades. Three.

524
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,371
Milton...

525
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:07,874
you're mumbling; we can't
understand a word you're saying.

526
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:10,126
12:22 P.M.

527
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:13,797
Their '84 Volvo heads into the hills.

528
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:18,343
lt is the last time anyone
will see the couple together.

529
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:20,220
By Bannister's admission...

530
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:23,390
the argument continues,
reaching a point...

531
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:25,058
when Debra demands...

532
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,351
to be let out.

533
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:30,563
At that moment, probably 12:26,
12:27 P.M., the car...

534
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:32,899
leaves the road on a curve...

535
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:38,530
presumably because Bannister
was driving too fast.

536
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,240
She was killed?

537
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:46,204
Her body was found
15 yards from the car.

538
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,415
Bannister...

539
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:52,252
was picked up 2 hours later,
wandering in the woods.

540
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:55,922
He claimed to have no recollection
of the events...

541
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:58,174
that occurred after the accident.

542
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:01,428
But here's the odd thing,
Mrs. Lynskey.

543
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:03,388
His utility knife...

544
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,057
was missing.

545
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:10,603
And to this day,
it has not been found.

546
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,108
But do you know
what was really bizarre?

547
00:46:16,776 --> 00:46:20,280
Debra's corpse
had the number 12...

548
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,574
carved into its forehead.

549
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:26,745
Unlucky for some.

550
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,713
You're insane. You're talking
about a mythical figure.

551
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:40,133
A pseudo-religious icon
from the 12th century.

552
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:45,430
Save your pea-brained prattle
for the classroom, boy.

553
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:48,975
That was the Soul Collector.

554
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:54,272
He's been taking people out
since time began.

555
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:59,152
He's going about some dark business
here in Fairwater...

556
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,780
and we ain't nothing
but worm bait!

557
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:05,450
When your number's up...

558
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,410
that's it!

559
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:14,626
There's another one gone.

560
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:11,182
He's gone.

561
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:14,394
There's no money for you here,
Mr. Bannister.

562
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:17,063
You're next.

563
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:19,357
Are you threatening me?

564
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,818
That's not what l'm saying.

565
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:23,695
He's threatening to kill me.

566
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:26,489
- Will you relax?
- He is threatening to kill me!

567
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,741
Bannister!

568
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:29,409
Oh, great.

569
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:30,702
Hey, fellas.

570
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,747
Excuse me, excuse me.

571
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:35,206
Put the gun away.

572
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:37,208
- Freeze!
- Just take it easy.

573
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:44,924
Okay, Bannister,
you're under arrest.

574
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:52,557
Just stay there, Bannister.

575
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:58,271
Yes.

576
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:07,280
Great.

577
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,115
l did it.

578
00:49:10,575 --> 00:49:12,118
Uh-uh-uh, Bannister. Stop.

579
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:16,748
Looks like l ain't shooting
with blanks no more!

580
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:23,129
Mighty fine woman.
Good teeth.

581
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:27,050
Judge.

582
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:28,593
Down!

583
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:32,305
They don't call me
the hanging judge for nothing.

584
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:39,938
Stay right there.

585
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:45,652
Heads up!

586
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:46,986
Good catch.

587
00:50:09,342 --> 00:50:10,510
Freeze!

588
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:17,267
Good shooting, Tex.

589
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:23,189
And she was
so young and beautiful!
