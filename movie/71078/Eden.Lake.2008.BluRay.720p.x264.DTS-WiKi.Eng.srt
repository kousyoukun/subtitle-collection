00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,169
Help me!

2
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:05,827
Can you play at peek-a-boo?

3
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:08,793
I can play at peek-a-boo!

4
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,834
Can you see me? Yes, I can.

5
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:14,366
Can you see me? Yes, I can.

6
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:18,082
Peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-boo!

7
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,327
Well done. That's very good. Now, ssh!

8
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,001
Still.

9
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:31,786
And everyone up.

10
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:37,035
And that's the end of the week. Well done.

11
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,913
- Hey.        
- Hey.

12
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,583
Sorry.

13
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:24,244
Kat's boyfriend is taking her to Paris for the weekend

14
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,289
and mine is taking me to a disused quarry!

15
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:29,905
It's a flooded quarry. Trust me. It's lovely.

16
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,254
It's the last chance to see it

17
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:32,793
before the developers build over it.

18
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,656
'Speed camera ahead.'

19
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,492
- Good on you, Kylie.        
- You're such a boy!

20
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,997
And I can mate it up to my mobile phone. Pretty sexy, huh?

21
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,028
Stop it, I'm driving.

22
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:56,910
What's that?

23
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,406
The guy's wife had a bad back. Kinky, huh?

24
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,364
Actually, it's quite nice.

25
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,785
Do you want me to pull over?

26

- Hey!

- And no Kylie!

What have you got there? A caterpillar?

94
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:06,474
My mum says I shouldn't talk to strangers.

95
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:10,855
Your mum's quite right. We'll leave you to it.

96

Come on.

97
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:30,684
Yes, you see, it is missing 50 executive homes.

98

I love it.

99
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,476
Is that new?

100
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,893
Yeah. Do you like it?

101
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:03,807
I like the bottom. I'm not so sure about the top, though.

102
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:24,762
- What the fuck are you doing here?       
- Clear off!

103
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:28,972
- What the fuck's all this shit?       
- Fucking little prick.

104
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,308
Hey, that's the little boy we saw.

105
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,306
Since when did you support England?

106
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:37,559
Little hoods.

107

Here, Mark, watch this.

108
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:43,137
Oh, Steve...

109
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,053
It's just boys being boys.

110
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,645
As long as they leave us alone.

111
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:53,140
Run for it, run!

112
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:56,268
- Get the fuck out of here!        
- Go on, have him.

113
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:20,101
Jesus!

114
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:23,053

115
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:25,556
Oh, my God.

116
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:28,305
Good girl, good girl, good girl.

117
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,137
Come on then.

118
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,810
Lovely.

119
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:43,092
Fancy a dip before it craps in the water?

120
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:46,640
No, you go. I'll keep an eye on the stuff.

121
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:48,806
Probably not a bad idea.

122
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,807
Good girl.

123
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:18,802
Oh, man!

124
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,966
Come on, Bonnie! Bonnie!

125
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:29,224
Bonnie, come here, girl! Come here! Come here!

126
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,424
Good girl, Bonnie.

127
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:52,885
Hey, guys. Can you do us a favour and turn the music down?

128
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:56,263
- Can't hear you, mate.        
- Turn your sounds down.

129
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:59,224
Can't hear you, mate.

130
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:07,173
- What are you doing?        
- And watch your dog.

131
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:09,796
- He's scaring my girlfriend.        
- She.

132
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,014
Bitch. She's a bitch.

133
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:17,705
Come on, guys. Don't be dicks. This is a big beach.

134
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:18,956
There's room for all of us.

135
00:14:18,993 --> 00:14:20,798
Who are you calling a dick?

136
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,551
And what are you looking at? My tits?

137
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:27,343
Fucking jog on! Prick.

138
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,299
Dickhead.

139
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:41,962
Hey, what a prick!

140
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,887
Mug!

141
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,793
Why don't we just find another spot?

142
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,690
I won't be bullied by a bunch of 12-year-olds.

143
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,947
And let it ruin our afternoon?

144
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,295
We were here first.

145
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:16,045
Well, this is relaxing

146
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,710
- What are you doing?        
- Fuck off!

147
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,920
Why? Why?

148
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:31,292
Oh, mate, I love bird-watching.

149
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:35,717
- What's with you, you tit?        
- You're the tit!

150
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,086
What are you looking at her for?

151
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,053
I'm not looking at her face, just her tits.

152
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,750
She's an ugly bint.

153
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,921
Yeah, do you want my autograph?

154
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:34,956
Happy now? Hmm?

155
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,959
Hey, Jenny!

156
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:55,631
Nearly!

157
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,665
Fancy another brewski?

158
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,874
Yeah, why not?

159
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,498
Steve, what's that?

160
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,498
It's nothing.

161
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,411
There's not much to do after dark.

162
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,007
Nope.

163
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:04,168
Wanna check out our exclusive New England home?

164
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:06,879
Sure.

165
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:11,165
- Do you like it?        
- I think it's beautiful.

166
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:27,079
Stephen Taylor...

167
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,205
What's that noise?

168
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,996
It's just the wind.

169
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:43,038
No, that's not the wind.

170
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:48,121
Could be a fox.

171
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:51,287
Or a donkey.

172
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,537
No, listen. Ssh!

173
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:58,870
You're just imagining it.

174
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:07,417
- I'll go take a look.        
- No, don't go... Go.

175
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,121
Steve?

176
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,369
Hello?

177
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,578
Steve?

178
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:36,786
Hello?

179
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,585
Steve!

180
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,411
Steve?

181
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:04,492
Steve, stop messing around!

182
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:19,701
Steve!

183
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:23,994
- That was horrible.        
- I'm sorry.

184
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:26,284
- Get off!        
- I'm really sorry.

185
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,618
- Ow! You're freezing!        
- Then warm me up.

186
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,494
You're a big, crude, pikey oaf!

187
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,996
I love you. Love you.

188
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,324
I am absolutely starving.

189
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:17,575
- I could eat a horse.        
- So move to France.

190
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,039
Fuck!

191
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,791
Shit!

192
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,914
- What's happened?        
- Little fuckers!

193
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,364
- How's your tyre, mate?        
- Fucking git!

194
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,572
Little fuckers!

195
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:58,279
No, wait, Steve!

196
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,494
- Watch it!        
- Shit!

197
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:07,783
You should've got a smaller body, fucking dollar boy!

198
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,949
- Breakfast?        
- Fuck!

199
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,655
Right, what would you like?

200
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,036
The full English with white toast and coffee. Thanks.

201
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:23,032
- And for you?        
- I'll get the same.

202
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:26,836
Hey, you wouldn't have seen a bunch of kids

203
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,538
tooling around on BMXs, would you?

204
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:31,239
Certainly have. Been terrorising you?

205
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:35,153
- Well, hassling us.        
- Little terrors.

206
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:40,155
I wouldn't worry too much, a big boy like you.

207
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:43,158
They punctured my back tyre.

208
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,023
I thought parents might want to know.

209
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:47,948
Not my kids.

210
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:50,779
No, I didn't mean they were your kids.

211
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:51,765
Not mine.

212
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:56,701
Never mind.

213
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,903
I don't want any trouble.

214
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,820
Making friends?

215
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:08,865
I think she likes me.

216
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,778
What the?

217
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,903
No, Steve, it's not worth it.

218
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:25,938
If everyone said that, where would we be?

219
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:27,472
I'll be back in a minute.

220
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:53,952
Hello?

221
00:23:59,203 --> 00:24:01,276
Anyone home?

222
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,784
Hello?

223
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:29,152
- Come on, you're blocking my drive!        
- OK.

224
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:31,358
- Come on!        
- All right!

225
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:33,565
Sorry!

226
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:35,775
Stupid bitch!

227
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:16,772
Shit!

228
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:23,737
Brett! Is that you? Get down here now!

229
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:26,071
Can't run away, little bunny.

230
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,407
Yeah, that's right, you can't because you're in a box.

231
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:34,028
Brett! Brett, don't make me come up there!

232
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:38,900
Shit!

233
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:42,947
Brett!

234
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:57,399
The hutch should be destroyed. Burn it.

235
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:59,273
Brett!

236
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,480
Let's go!

237
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:08,102
I can feel that schoolteacher look.

238
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,280
Yeah, you're lucky. You could have broken something.

239
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:16,566
- Let's just enjoy the weekend.        
- Yeah, I'd like that.

240
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,648
Yes?

241
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:38,314
- You were going to say something?        
- No, not a word.

242
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:40,769
- Are you sure?        
- Yeah, I'm sure.

243
00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:43,626
Because I thought you were looking at my foot.

244
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:45,000
No, wait. No, no!

245
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:47,400
You're going in!        Steve, no!

246
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:51,939
No!

247
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,980
- Oh, it's fucking freezing.        
- Language!

248
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:28,519
All right, lazy bones?

249
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:44,652
It's amazing the stuff you find at the bottom of the lake.

250
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:47,851
Steve, where's the beach bag?

251
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:51,018
It was right here.

252
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:57,523
I don't believe it. It's got the car keys in it.

253
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:03,897
Please, God, don't tell me...

254
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,525
Fuck!

255
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:11,272
Fuck! Fuck!

256
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:58,149
Tossers!

257
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:11,682
- Are you OK?        
- Yeah.

258
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:47,472
Jenny, come on.

259
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,972
Come on.        No... Let's just leave it.

260
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:14,179
They've got our car.

261
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,766
Go on, go on. Go on!

262
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,564
Fucking shitting itself! Fuck off!

263
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:29,015
Brett!

264
00:30:37,814 --> 00:30:41,179
Listen... I don't care what you're up to here.

265
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:43,106
I just want my car back.

266
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:45,332
It's not us, mate.

267
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,303
Car keys, phone, wallet.

268
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:55,885
- Not us, mate.        
- Steve, come on. Let's leave it.

269
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,225
- You're wearing my shades.        
- They're mine, mate.

270
00:31:00,355 --> 00:31:02,808
Your Ray-Ban Aviators?

271
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:05,011
Fakes, mate.

272
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:09,801
Yeah, Steve, come on.

273
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:14,391
Listen... You've had your fun.

274
00:31:15,562 --> 00:31:19,176
Let's just call it quits. Tell me where the car is.

275
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:22,641
Keep that animal back.

276
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,135
- Where's my fucking car?        
- I've got no idea, mate.

277
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,805
- Watch that fucking dog!        
- Watch yours!

278
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,223
What did you say?

279
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:35,965
That's my phone.

280
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:39,219
- Steve...        
- Got the same ringtone as me?

281
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:43,099
Steve!

282
00:31:44,978 --> 00:31:47,679
Hit him! He's got a fucking knife!

283
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:01,757
Bonnie...

284
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:07,049
Bonnie! Bonnie!

285
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:15,258
You stuck my dog.

286
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:19,312
It was an accident. Give me the car keys.

287
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:20,422
I'll drive her to the vet.

288
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,595
Come on, let's go.

289
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,694
Fuck off!

290
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:41,813
She's... She's fucking dying.

291
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:45,756
I'm sorry.

292
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:48,510
- She's fucking dying!        
- Brett...

293
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:51,095
- Brett...        
- Fuck off!

294
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:56,007
Bonnie, don't die on me. Not you. Bonnie!

295
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,469
Steve...

296
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,218
I've got the car keys. Let's just go.

297
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,182
- Come on!        
- Don't die on me, Bonnie!

298
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:05,926
Come on, Steve!

299
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:15,924
Bonnie!

300
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,886
Come on, come on.

301
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:28,137
Get 'em!

302
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:32,801
Fuck!

303
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,469
Steve, quick!

304
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:51,628
Right!

305
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:54,550
Shit!

306
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:57,888
Go back!

307
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:03,920
Shit!

308
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:13,629
- Get on to it!        
- Jesus Christ!

309
00:34:13,764 --> 00:34:15,801
Come on!

310
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:18,051
Quick, go back!

311
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,171
Get out the fucking car!

312
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:23,670
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!        
- Fuck!

313
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,879
Get out the fucking car!

314
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:28,419
Get out the fucking car!

315
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,297
Fucking prick!

316
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,467
Oh, my God! Shit!

317
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:39,760
You fucking bitch!      Steve!

318
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,633
I can't see, I can't fucking see.

319
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:48,342
I can't see where we're fucking going! Jesus Christ!

320
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:54,542
Shit!

321
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:03,880
Are you all right? Wait.

322
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:08,343
- I can't get...        
- I'm stuck!

323
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:10,202
I'm fucking stuck!

324
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:11,586
- Wait.         
- Jesus!

325
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,085
- I can't get it.        
- OK... Listen to me.

326
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,301
- Oh, my God, they're coming!        
- Listen to me!

327
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:21,426
Listen. Go. Find a road. Take this.

328
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,337
- No...        
- Go get help! Go!

329
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,539
Fucking kill 'em!

330
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:44,083
This way, this way, come on!

331
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:54,177
Brett, it's over here!

332
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:55,675
Fuck!

333
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:58,372
Come over here. I've got the car!

334
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:06,870
Brett, this is fucked up!

335
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:10,812
It's ten fucking miles into town in the dark.

336
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:14,478
She's not fucking Lassie! It's out of the time, blood man.

337
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:18,078
Are you watching the road?

338
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,667
No one goes home. You get here now!

339
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:25,500
Please, let me go. I won't say anything. Please, let me go.

340
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:30,374
Listen, Brett, people know that we're here.

341
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:33,123
They're going to call the police.

342
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:38,207
If you let me go, I swear on my life, I won't tell anyone.

343
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:40,276
Look, guys, come on, please.

344
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,525
We can stop this. Nobody's died yet.

345
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:45,286
My fucking dog died though!

346
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:47,625
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

347
00:38:47,754 --> 00:38:48,670
It was an accident.

348
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:50,129
There's going to be another accident

349
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,410
when I find that bitch of yours!

350
00:38:54,337 --> 00:38:57,749
"No one's died." Wait and see what happens to her

351
00:38:57,879 --> 00:39:00,367
when I fucking see her!

352
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,165
Get the fuck off me! Fucking little prick!

353
00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:06,748
Let's not be head-loose, right?

354
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:10,742
- Who are you calling head-loose?        
- Let's not be rash.

355
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,500
First phone he sees, 999 - who's fucking head-loose?

356
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:22,200
No, this is rash shit, man. I never touched him.

357
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:29,208
- What, you didn't touch him?        
- No, mate.

358
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,242
You fucking touch him now then!

359
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,874
Him or me.

360
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:49,828
You wanna front, you wanna act like the fucking big man?

361
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,164
You'll step up now.

362
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,783
All right.

363
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:07,742
Jesus...

364
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,446
Paige, get this!

365
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:16,375
Don't fucking record it, man.

366
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:20,739
No, wait.

367
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,949
Fucking wait!

368
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:33,825
- Go on then.        
- Fuck you!

369
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:46,287
No. That's not even a proper cut. Deeper.

370
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,782
Deeper!

371
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,786
Fuck!

372
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:05,576
All right, now everyone'll have a dig. Marky Mark?

373
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:18,456
Jesus!

374
00:41:18,582 --> 00:41:21,781
- Oh, man, I can't fucking see this!        
- Jesus!

375
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,239
- Fuck's sake.        
- Go on, Mark.

376
00:41:28,373 --> 00:41:32,069
Jesus Christ, fucking bollocks.

377
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:40,118
Ricky Dicky...

378
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:58,829
Go on.

379
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:05,076
Shit! My shoe!

380
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:09,529
These are fucking Gold Tops, man. Brand-new.

381
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:11,903
You little fuckwit.

382
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:14,906
Cooper! Bang on, mate, you're up!

383
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:16,151
What?

384
00:42:16,288 --> 00:42:18,361
Come on, mate.

385
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,777
Knife.

386
00:42:21,913 --> 00:42:23,986
Paige, keep that phone up.

387
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,699
Right, Coops, everyone has a dig.

388
00:42:36,371 --> 00:42:39,653
Go on then, Cooper. Let's see your bottle.

389
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:56,949
Come on, come on. Please.

390
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,193
Brett, I can't.

391
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:11,617
For fuck's sake, listen! We're all in this together. Go on.

392
00:43:11,745 --> 00:43:14,067
- Come on. He's only a little scared.        
- I'm not scared.

393
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:17,122
Listen. He's heard all of our fucking names.

394
00:43:17,307 --> 00:43:19,432
Either do it or he's gonna spill.

395
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,448
Go on...

396
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,399
Do it! Cut his fucking tongue out!

397
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:37,069
- Fucking hell! That's bloody.        
- That's lethal.

398
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,863
- Here you are.        
- I can't believe you did that.

399
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:48,481
Look - it's Tony Montana!

400
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:56,817
All right. Now we've got to finish this.

401
00:44:08,576 --> 00:44:11,064
Please, please...

402
00:44:12,326 --> 00:44:14,612
Please, please, please.

403
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:21,233
Please...

404
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,863
What's up?

405
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:32,232
Bluetooth. She's fucking here.

406
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:35,151
Jenny, run! Run!

407
00:44:35,283 --> 00:44:37,569
Come on! Run!

408
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:15,692
There's the bitch!

409
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:33,903
Bitch!

410
00:45:37,614 --> 00:45:40,481
Well, fuck the bikes. Come on!

411
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:19,067
Fuck!

412
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:30,687
Get to the clearing. Guard the fucker.

413
00:46:53,737 --> 00:46:55,810
Right.

414
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:01,481
Where is she?

415
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:16,935
Oh, shit!

416
00:47:20,694 --> 00:47:23,016
- Brett, he's gone!        
- What?

417
00:47:23,152 --> 00:47:24,179
He's not here!

418
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,856
Mate, he's cut to fuck. Ain't going too far. Follow the blood.

419
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:30,858
Come on!

420
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:51,602
Fuck's sake!

421
00:47:54,943 --> 00:47:56,898
Oi! Oi!

422
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:48,685
- Steve!         
- Jenny...

423
00:48:48,816 --> 00:48:51,517
Come on! We've got to get out of here!

424
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:53,805
Come on...

425
00:48:58,274 --> 00:49:00,311
Come on.

426
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:16,935
Come on.

427
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,763
This way.

428
00:49:34,522 --> 00:49:36,808
Gently! All right?

429
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:40,551
- I'm all right.        
- That's it.

430
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:48,971
OK. We're going to clean you up, all right?

431
00:49:48,973 --> 00:49:50,734
We're going to clean you up.

432
00:49:54,272 --> 00:49:56,345
Drink some water.

433
00:49:58,022 --> 00:49:59,644
I'm...

434
00:50:00,688 --> 00:50:02,974
Well done. All right.

435
00:50:16,563 --> 00:50:19,430
OK, this is going to sting.

436
00:50:19,562 --> 00:50:20,592
OK...

437
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:24,059
Well done. I know it does sting.

438
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:35,893
- Oh, shit!        
- How does it look?

439
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:41,309
- It looks worse than it is.        
- Let me see.

440
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:48,262
Oh, Jesus! God! That's black blood. Gut blood.

441
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:52,554
- I'm fucking bleeding to death!        
- You're not going to die!

442
00:50:52,686 --> 00:50:55,470
I'm not going to let you die! I'm not!

443
00:50:55,603 --> 00:50:58,254
They haven't hit any arteries.

444
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:00,321
Right. You've just got to stay calm.

445
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:03,509
You have to stay calm. You can't go into shock.

446
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:06,487
Deep breaths, measured breaths. Stay still.

447
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:10,204
You're going to be all right. You'll be all right,

448
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:11,723
you'll be OK. I promise.

449
00:51:13,436 --> 00:51:15,509
I'm so sorry.

450
00:51:15,644 --> 00:51:18,392
I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do.

451
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,261
I thought Africa for a honeymoon.

452
00:51:31,768 --> 00:51:34,256
Beach first, for a rest,

453
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,466
and then safari.

454
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:41,969
I don't care where we go as long as I'm with you.

455
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:44,589
Africa sounds lovely.

456
00:51:50,934 --> 00:51:53,504
I even asked your old man.

457
00:52:01,475 --> 00:52:03,512
Shit!

458
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,514
Other side.

459
00:52:10,683 --> 00:52:12,720
Ah... shit.

460
00:52:26,308 --> 00:52:28,428
That's him. He's been here.

461
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:41,590
Find him and drain him like a fucking bottle.

462
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:46,048
- I'm tired, Brett.        
- Shut up, shite bag. Is that you?

463
00:52:46,182 --> 00:52:49,096
Is that you, fat lad?

464
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:57,006
- No, not mine, mate.        
- That's a girl's footprint.

465
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,221
Well, she's with him, then.

466
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:16,190
That fucker can't be far.

467
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,872
He's nearly half fucking dead. Listen to me. Split up.

468
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:23,714
Spread out between here and the fence. All right, come on.

469
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:32,419
You fat fuck!

470
00:53:35,305 --> 00:53:40,211
Come on. Get going. Work off some of that weight, you fat shit.

471
00:54:03,429 --> 00:54:05,384
Sorry...

472
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:26,880
Well done. Let's get your head down.

473
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:31,135
That's it, that's it. Well done. Well done.

474
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,259
Steve?

475
00:54:37,386 --> 00:54:40,383
Steve! Steve, please...

476
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,217
I've got to get us out of here. OK?

477
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:51,296
- I can't move.        
- Then I've got to go. OK?

478
00:54:51,428 --> 00:54:53,418
I'm safe here.

479
00:54:53,553 --> 00:54:55,543
They've gone.

480
00:54:57,011 --> 00:55:01,170
You need blood, Steve, or you're going to die.

481
00:55:02,802 --> 00:55:05,290
I need to get to town.

482
00:55:11,677 --> 00:55:14,378
I saw power pylons on the way in.

483
00:55:16,218 --> 00:55:18,706
They must lead somewhere.

484
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:35,797
Look.

485
00:55:35,926 --> 00:55:37,797
Look!

486
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:47,673
Now you stay hidden... and you hold on.

487
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:49,756
You come back.

488
00:56:48,423 --> 00:56:50,602
Brett, I'm really tired.

489
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:52,870
Take a toke on this, you little shit!

490
00:57:00,923 --> 00:57:02,960
Come on!

491
00:57:15,172 --> 00:57:18,004
Aaaaaiee! God!

492
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:20,918
God!

493
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:26,919
Oi, oi, oi! This way, yeah?

494
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:45,329
Come on!

495
01:00:15,332 --> 01:00:17,405
It's OK! It's...

496
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:22,198
It's me. It's... It's Jenny. Remember me from the lake?

497
01:00:25,374 --> 01:00:28,704
I just... I need some help.

498
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,946
I want to talk to your mum. Can you take me to her?

499
01:00:37,582 --> 01:00:40,283
She's working.

500
01:00:40,415 --> 01:00:42,370
But I'm...

501
01:00:46,956 --> 01:00:49,657
I really need to get into town.

502
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:52,787
Can you please just show me the way?

503
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:16,888
Wait. Shouldn't we follow the power lines?

504
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,289
No, this way's quicker.

505
01:01:20,663 --> 01:01:23,233
My mum picks me up down here.

506
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:28,906
What? Here? In her car with your bike?

507
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:32,618
What?

508
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:48,786
- Have you got a signal here?       
- No, just games.

509
01:01:48,912 --> 01:01:51,613
She should be here soon.

510
01:01:53,412 --> 01:01:56,042
I thought you said your mother was working.

511
01:01:56,043 --> 01:01:57,273
She's finished her shift.

512
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:02,658
- No signal?        
- One bar.

513
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:05,065
- Adam, I need your phone.        
- Why?

514
01:02:05,066 --> 01:02:06,577
- To call the police.        
- We shouldn't be here!

515
01:02:06,578 --> 01:02:08,411
- Please!        
- Its battery's low!

516
01:02:08,413 --> 01:02:09,974
It doesn't matter. I only need it for seconds.

517
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:12,492
My mum might need to call me back!

518
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:18,948
Adam, your mum is coming to get you, isn't she?

519
01:02:19,078 --> 01:02:21,234
Adam, what's going on?

520
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,445
Where have you brought me? Please, Adam!

521
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:28,492
Please... just give me the bloody phone!

522
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,486
How now brown cow!

523
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:01,319
She's awake! Brett, she's fucking awake!

524
01:03:01,451 --> 01:03:06,440
Mark, you fucking pussy! You didn't hit her hard enough!

525
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,365
Oh, fuck!

526
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:20,939
We found him.

527
01:03:22,492 --> 01:03:25,791
Brett, we can't fucking do this! She's alive!

528
01:03:25,793 --> 01:03:26,706
And he's dead.

529
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:32,364
We did him.

530
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:35,311
Paige has got you every last one you

531
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:36,902
fucking move all having a dig.

532
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:39,873
It's on her phone. No ballsing out now, lads.

533
01:03:40,908 --> 01:03:42,453
No backing down.

534
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:48,738
Oh, Jesus...

535
01:03:51,325 --> 01:03:55,863
- Paige, get filming. Come here.        
- Oh, fuck it!

536
01:03:58,824 --> 01:04:02,023
Look at me, man. Wanna be in our gang?

537
01:04:02,158 --> 01:04:04,646
Prove yourself, then.

538
01:04:05,991 --> 01:04:10,612
No, please...! Adam, no, please... don't do it!

539
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:13,655
Please, don't do it! Please...!

540
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,275
Go on. Go on.

541
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:22,821
- What?        
- Listen, you've seen too much.

542
01:04:22,948 --> 01:04:26,644
You either do it now, yeah, or you're next.

543
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:32,275
Go on, then.

544
01:04:34,198 --> 01:04:36,768
Go on!

545
01:04:45,073 --> 01:04:47,526
No! No-o-o!

546
01:04:49,364 --> 01:04:52,148
Stop!

547
01:04:54,072 --> 01:04:56,607
That fucking stinks.

548
01:04:56,739 --> 01:05:00,449
Fucking look at that! Fucking that was you.

549
01:05:00,593 --> 01:05:02,340
That was fucking you, not me.

550
01:05:02,377 --> 01:05:04,773
- Fucking you.       
- Please...!

551
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:07,986
Fucking bitch. Ask her if it's warm.

552
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:11,544
Is it warm? Say it! Is it warm?

553
01:05:12,113 --> 01:05:15,525
Fucking you do it an' all! Fucking you all! Ask her!

554
01:05:15,655 --> 01:05:19,565
- Is it warm? Is it warm?       
- Say it! Louder!

555
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:21,982
Is it warm?

556
01:05:22,113 --> 01:05:25,809
Fucking burn! Burn, you little bitch! Go on!

557
01:05:25,946 --> 01:05:31,361
Yeah! Fucking hell! Fucking smile, boy. You fucking love it.

558
01:05:39,862 --> 01:05:42,267
Oi, oi!

559
01:05:47,279 --> 01:05:49,684
Go on, then.

560
01:05:55,528 --> 01:05:58,016
Come here, you fucking shit!

561
01:05:58,153 --> 01:06:02,016
You get the fuck back here or I'll burn him!

562
01:06:02,153 --> 01:06:05,352
Come on! Come on!

563
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:09,774
Right! Do him!

564
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:13,599
Help! Jenny, help!

565
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,809
Help! Help!

566
01:06:15,944 --> 01:06:17,815
Help!

567
01:08:20,482 --> 01:08:24,262
- OK...       
- Brett, this way!

568
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:58,098
She's got the fucking map! She knows which way to go.

569
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:02,260
No, we know which way she's fucking going.

570
01:09:02,261 --> 01:09:04,121
There's one track into town.

571
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,644
- She won't go far on her foot, will she?        
- Look.

572
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:10,552
What? What does it say?

573
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,727
"Jenny Greengrass and Steve Taylor attacked.

574
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:15,840
"Mark, Brett, Ricky, Cooper."

575
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:18,056
Shit, we're famous, mate!

576
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:20,889
- You got a match?        
- No, mate.

577
01:09:22,646 --> 01:09:24,719
Fuck it, then.

578
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,892
I swear. When I find that fucking bitch,

579
01:09:28,894 --> 01:09:30,517
I'm going to fucking bury her, mate.

580
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,093
Fucking hell!

581
01:09:42,354 --> 01:09:45,268
Little prick, come on.

582
01:11:19,017 --> 01:11:20,972
Miss...

583
01:12:05,682 --> 01:12:08,383
I can't stand it...!

584
01:12:22,348 --> 01:12:24,303
No...!

585
01:12:28,389 --> 01:12:30,426
No, no, no!

586
01:12:51,513 --> 01:12:53,888
We're not going to fucking find her in the dark!

587
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:56,314
Yes, we fucking are! Go on!

588
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:09,801
Brett!

589
01:13:09,929 --> 01:13:12,796
- Paige?        
- Brett!

590
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:24,837
- Brett!        
- Paige?

591
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:52,256
Look at what you've fucking done! Fuck!

592
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:56,545
You know what, Brett? Fuck this - I'm gone, mate.

593
01:13:56,678 --> 01:13:57,921
What?

594
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:03,509
No. No, no, no. Paige, phone.

595
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,961
Look! Look, look, look. Look, look, it's you. That's you.

596
01:14:16,094 --> 01:14:20,463
I didn't want this. I didn't want to fucking kill him

597
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:22,206
or fucking burn that lad ever!

598
01:14:22,243 --> 01:14:24,959
- And I don't want to go to pen.        
- Pen?

599
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,794
What do you know about pen?

600
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:33,416
Have you been inside? Has your old man been inside?

601
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:38,254
What the fuck are you crying for, you fucking girl?

602
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,629
Who you calling?

603
01:14:46,842 --> 01:14:50,041
Who you calling?

604
01:14:50,176 --> 01:14:53,755
Put that down. Put that...

605
01:14:53,884 --> 01:14:57,498
Put that down. Put it down. Put it down.

606
01:14:57,634 --> 01:14:59,671
Put it down.

607
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:07,246
- Brett!        
- I'll fucking batter you!

608
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:10,333
I'll fucking batter you!

609
01:15:10,467 --> 01:15:12,374
Brett...!

610
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:17,579
I... told... you... to... put... that... down!

611
01:15:17,716 --> 01:15:21,247
Fucker! Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!

612
01:15:24,174 --> 01:15:29,080
Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

613
01:15:29,216 --> 01:15:32,960
Turn it off! Turn it off, you fucking bitch!

614
01:16:26,464 --> 01:16:30,753
- God! Are you OK?        
- You've got to help me!

615
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,418
- Please, just get me out of here.        
- Fuck! What's going on?

616
01:16:35,547 --> 01:16:37,601
Please, just help me. They killed my boyfriend and kill you!

617
01:16:37,602 --> 01:16:39,194
Just get me out of here.

618
01:16:39,196 --> 01:16:40,718
All right! All right! Get in the car!

619
01:16:47,588 --> 01:16:51,533
- What happened back there?        
- I'm being hunted.

620
01:16:51,671 --> 01:16:55,830
- Hunted? By who?        
- A gang. Just get me into town.

621
01:16:55,963 --> 01:17:00,335
- Town's the other way.        
- Why the other way?

622
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:04,129
Me fucking brother's out here! He's supposed to be home.

623
01:17:04,254 --> 01:17:09,041
- Your brother?        
- My little brother. Now I'm worried.

624
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:12,003
- Oh, no...        
- Ricky?

625
01:17:12,129 --> 01:17:15,162
Ricky, are you OK? You ready?

626
01:17:15,295 --> 01:17:18,044
I'll be there in two ticks. Yeah?

627
01:17:18,046 --> 01:17:20,235
No, please, stop! Turn around!

628
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:23,623
- Please, go the other way!        
- I will.

629
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:39,454
Fuck! They better be OK.

630
01:17:41,711 --> 01:17:43,666
Ricky?

631
01:17:45,669 --> 01:17:49,958
Ricky? Ricky, you little shite! Where are you?

632
01:17:51,919 --> 01:17:54,347
Little bastard! I've got better things to do.

633
01:17:54,348 --> 01:17:56,721
Mum's worried sick.

634
01:17:57,336 --> 01:18:01,116
This lady says she's been hunted. You know about this?

635
01:20:22,622 --> 01:20:27,195
# Please believe us We ain't ever gonna be respectable

636
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:30,493
# Like us, hate us, but you'll... #

637
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:33,821
Somebody, please help me!

638
01:20:33,955 --> 01:20:38,411
#... respectable, respectable... #

639
01:20:41,496 --> 01:20:44,410
Don't just stand there!

640
01:20:48,579 --> 01:20:50,818
- Get her in the house.        
- Come on, then.

641
01:20:54,412 --> 01:20:57,899
- You've been through the wars.        
- What happened?

642
01:20:57,901 --> 01:20:58,786
Take your time.

643
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:00,383
Come on, give her some air.

644
01:21:00,558 --> 01:21:04,799
That stings, sorry. Thanks, Tan.

645
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:08,151
Yeah. We'll put this down here.

646
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:12,778
- You're safe now.        
- Lots of big ugly men around.

647
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,617
I'm still at Uncle Jon's.

648
01:21:16,745 --> 01:21:20,690
- A woman crashed in, looking like death.        
- Mel!

649
01:21:20,828 --> 01:21:23,944
That's a lovely ring. From your fella?

650
01:21:25,286 --> 01:21:27,774
What's that?

651
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:31,572
Hey, Clyde! Come here! Down! Out!

652
01:21:31,703 --> 01:21:35,644
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

653
01:21:35,645 --> 01:21:37,112
Sorry. He's no good with strangers.

654
01:21:37,149 --> 01:21:40,821
Mel? Mel, what's going on?

655
01:21:40,952 --> 01:21:44,862
What the fuck?! That's Reece's van!

656
01:21:44,994 --> 01:21:48,489
- Go on, tell me!        
- Bustard! I'll fucking kill him!

657
01:21:48,619 --> 01:21:52,564
- Hang on...        
- Give me the fucking phone!

658
01:21:52,702 --> 01:21:56,233
- Get me an ambulance.        
- Jon?

659
01:21:56,369 --> 01:22:00,741
Jon, get an ambulance. Get this lady an ambulance.

660
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:06,780
- I want the police.        
- Eh? No, no, no. Don't worry, love.

661
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:09,611
You let us do that. Just stay here.

662
01:22:09,743 --> 01:22:14,151
- Ssh. You just sit quiet.        
- I'm going to be sick.

663
01:22:14,285 --> 01:22:19,191
I'll get you to the loo. Come on. Come with me. Come on, love.

664
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:23,772
In here. Here we go.

665
01:22:24,826 --> 01:22:27,527
Lee Trevitt! Get out!

666
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:30,649
Sorry about this.

667
01:22:31,492 --> 01:22:34,608
Get out! Go on, love.

668
01:22:40,242 --> 01:22:42,197
Oh, God...

669
01:22:49,617 --> 01:22:51,903
Oh, God. Oh, God...

670
01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:36,154
Open the fucking door!

671
01:23:38,323 --> 01:23:40,396
Open it up!

672
01:23:40,531 --> 01:23:43,315
Open the fucking door!

673
01:23:52,823 --> 01:23:54,860
- Is this the lady?        
- Yeah.

674
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:58,373
You fucking slag! I'll fucking kill you!

675
01:23:58,375 --> 01:23:59,559
Come on, love!

676
01:23:59,614 --> 01:24:03,439
- What's he told you? He's a liar!        
- What about the van?!

677
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:05,460
I was just trying to get away. They killed Steve!

678
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:07,404
Yeah. You sell out your sick bastard boyfriend!

679
01:24:07,426 --> 01:24:10,235
No. Just call the police! Call the police.

680
01:24:10,237 --> 01:24:12,245
Call the police? What good are they to her?

681
01:24:15,322 --> 01:24:17,395
Fuck!

682
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:21,357
You want to play with the big boys now?

683
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:23,561
Jon... Jon...

684
01:24:23,697 --> 01:24:26,185
She killed her little one.

685
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:31,476
Look at her. You fucking look at her now!

686
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:39,025
- You fucking keep looking at her.        
- They're just children!

687
01:24:39,154 --> 01:24:42,151
Just children! They're just children!

688
01:24:42,279 --> 01:24:45,146
I didn't mean to...

689
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:49,354
They started this!      And we're gonna finish it.

690
01:24:49,487 --> 01:24:53,350
Look, there's dead kids, man.

691
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:55,888
The police will be round here. The police will ask questions.

692
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:57,768
Doesn't mean they'll get any answers, does it?

693
01:24:59,404 --> 01:25:02,119
We look after our own round here.

694
01:25:02,237 --> 01:25:06,100
- Now... Now take Brett to bed.        
- No...

695
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:09,898
Brett, get upstairs now! You little bastard!

696
01:25:10,028 --> 01:25:12,314
Get upstairs now.

697
01:25:13,695 --> 01:25:16,396
Please, don't...!

698
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:19,194
Just put her in the shower.

699
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,191
No-o-o!
