抱歉
Sorry.

14
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:24,244
凱特的男朋友帶她去巴黎過週末
Kat's boyfriend is taking her to Paris for the weekend

15
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,289
我男朋友卻帶我去廢棄的獵場
and mine is taking me to a disused quarry!

16
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:29,905
是個被淹沒的獵場 相信我 很可愛
It's a flooded quarry. Trust me. It's lovely.

17
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,254
在開發商把那建上樓前
It's the last chance to see it

18
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:32,793
這是最後一次機會了
before the developers build over it.

19
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,656
前方有測速攝像頭
'Speed camera ahead.'

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,492
好樣的 凱麗      你真是個孩子
Good on you, Kylie.        You're such a boy!

21
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,997
這點可以用我的手機來彌補 它很性感吧
And I can mate it up to my mobile phone. Pretty sexy, huh?

22
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,028
停下 我在開車呢
Stop it, I'm driving.

23
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:56,910
那是什麼
What's that?

24
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,406
這傢伙的老婆背不好 很奇怪對吧
The guy's wife had a bad back. Kinky, huh?

25
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,364
事實上 挺舒服的
Actually, it's quite nice.

26
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,785
你想讓我停車嗎
Do you want me to pull over?

27
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:15,239
下午好 你一直在談無力的家長
'Good afternoon. You've been talking about fining parents

28
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:18,904
他們不能控制自己孩子的行為
'who fail to control their children's behaviour.

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,493
這種政策什麼時候實行的
'When was the policy introduced? '

30
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:23,141
學會尊重是05年大選
'As you probably remember The Respect Agenda

31
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:25,574
的重要議題
was a big issue in the last election at 2005.

32
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,240
布萊爾想把尊重的思想
'Tony Blair wanted to bring back a sense of respect

33
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,962
帶入學校與社區
'in schools and communities.'

34
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,446
所以提高給家長的資助
'So increase the amount of support for parents,

35
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,451
包括與家長簽訂合同
'including parenting contracts,

36
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:41,489
讓家長去參加如何為人父母的課程
'to get parents to attend parenting classes.'

37
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:45,153
這個問題是... 這是你的問題 你來解決
'It's a case of... "It's your problem, you sort it."

38
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,809
沒有學校支持 這難以做到
'It's hard to do without the school behind you.

39
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,456
...不願去學校
'...struggling to school as well

40
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,949
我家的8歲孩子也不願去學校
'I have an 8-year-old struggling to school as well.'

41
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:55,033
讓你的孩子去上學 這是少數人的做法
'Get your kids to school This is a tiny minority and

42
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,662
孩子需要學東西
children need to be in school in order to learn,

43
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:58,932
這很關鍵
that is crucial.

44
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,739
然而 早期的干預不夠迅速來...
'However, the early intervention isn't as quick to... '

45
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:03,959
這種被處罰的局面很難被扭轉
'It's hard to turn it over, being fined.

46
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,173
孩子們從中學不到任何東西
Kids are not learning anything by that.

47
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,240
他們知道我們會付錢的 所以他們會提起
'They know we're going to pay so they gonna mention it.

48
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:11,658
他們覺得很高興
They find it hilarious.

49
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:15,033
在報紙上讀到他們...
'You know, reading about themselves in the papers... '

50
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:18,278
就在這附近
It's up here somewhere.

51
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:21,529
在十字路口處左轉
'At the traffic lights, turn left.'

52
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:31,033
上帝啊
Jesus!

53
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,696
到了 有啤酒 床和早餐
Here it is. Beer, bed and breakfast.

Perfect.

55
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:58,982
不是吧
No way!

56
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:16,274
抱歉
Excuse me?

57
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:18,484
酒吧的氣氛不錯
Great bar presence!

58
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,692
要點什麼
Ey up, me duck?

Give it back, give it back, give it back!

61
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,773
他們應該上床了 對吧
A bit past their bedtime, isn't it?

62
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,611
是的 小東西們一定累壞了
Yeah, poor things must be exhausted.

63
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:41,525
小孩需要個好的...
That child needs a good...

64
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,065
我他媽告訴你了
I bloody told you!

65

Call yourself a mother?        You what?

Go and tell them to shut up.        You tell them.

71
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:18,319
你是什麼 男人還是老鼠
What are you? A man or a mouse?

72
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,815
聽著 我上次來還挺好的
Look, it was all right the last time I was here.

73
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,272

拜託 小姐
Please, Miss?

78
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:02,773
一有路口就左轉

伊甸湖 他媽的 斯萊普頓獵場

80
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,561

"Gated community"? Who are they so afraid of?

81
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:18,771

142
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,793
我們為什麼不再找個地方呢
Why don't we just find another spot?

143
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,690
我不能被一群12歲的小孩嚇住了
I won't be bullied by a bunch of 12-year-olds.

144
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,947
那就讓這事毀了我們的下午?
And let it ruin our afternoon?

145

我們先來的
We were here first.

146

這就讓人舒心了
Well, this is relaxing

147
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,710

你看她幹什麼
What are you looking at her for?

152
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,053
我沒看她的臉 看她的奶頭
I'm not looking at her face, just her tits.

153
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,750
她是個丑婊子
She's an ugly bint.

154

Nearly!

158
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,665
想再喝點啤酒嗎
Fancy another brewski?

159
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,874
是的 為什麼不呢
Yeah, why not?

160
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,498
史蒂夫 那是什麼
Steve, what's that?

161
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,498
沒什麼
It's nothing.

162
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,411
天黑後沒什麼可做
There's not much to do after dark.

163

00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:11,165
你喜歡嗎      我覺得很漂亮
Do you like it?        I think it's beautiful.

167
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:27,079
史蒂芬·泰勒
Stephen Taylor...

168
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,205
那是什麼聲音
What's that noise?

169
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,996
風聲而已
It's just the wind.

170
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:43,038
不 不是風聲
No, that's not the wind.

Get off!        I'm really sorry.

186
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,618
你凍透了      那就暖暖我
Ow! You're freezing!        Then warm me up.

187
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,494

You're a big, crude, pikey oaf!

Are you sure?        Yeah, I'm sure.

We're going to clean you up.

Oh, Jesus! God! That's black blood. Gut blood.

442
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:52,554

I'm fucking bleeding to death!        You're not going to die!

443

No, not mine, mate.        That's a girl's footprint.
