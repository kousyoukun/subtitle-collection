凯特的男朋友带她去巴黎过周末
Kat's boyfriend is taking her to Paris for the weekend

15
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,289
我男朋友却带我去废弃的猎场
and mine is taking me to a disused quarry!

16
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:29,905
是个被淹没的猎场 相信我 很可爱
It's a flooded quarry. Trust me. It's lovely.

17
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,254
在开发商把那建上楼前
It's the last chance to see it

18
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:32,793
这是最后一次机会了
before the developers build over it.

19
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,656
前方有测速摄像头
'Speed camera ahead.'

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,492
好样的 凯丽      你真是个孩子
Good on you, Kylie.        You're such a boy!

21
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,997
这点可以用我的手机来弥补 它很性感吧
And I can mate it up to my mobile phone. Pretty sexy, huh?

22
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,028
停下 我在开车呢
Stop it, I'm driving.

23
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:56,910
那是什么
What's that?

24
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,406
这家伙的老婆背不好 很奇怪对吧
The guy's wife had a bad back. Kinky, huh?

25
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,364
事实上 挺舒服的
Actually, it's quite nice.

26
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,785
你想让我停车吗
Do you want me to pull over?

27
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:15,239
下午好 你一直在谈无力的家长
'Good afternoon. You've been talking about fining parents

28
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:18,904
他们不能控制自己孩子的行为
'who fail to control their children's behaviour.

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,493
这种政策什么时候实行的
'When was the policy introduced? '

30
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:23,141
学会尊重是05年大选
'As you probably remember The Respect Agenda

31
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:25,574
的重要议题
was a big issue in the last election at 2005.

32
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,240
布莱尔想把尊重的思想
'Tony Blair wanted to bring back a sense of respect

33
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,962
带入学校与社区
'in schools and communities.'

34
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,446
所以提高给家长的资助
'So increase the amount of support for parents,

35
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,451
包括与家长签订合同
'including parenting contracts,

36
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:41,489
让家长去参加如何为人父母的课程
'to get parents to attend parenting classes.'

37
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:45,153
这个问题是... 这是你的问题 你来解决
'It's a case of... "It's your problem, you sort it."

38
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,809
没有学校支持 这难以做到
'It's hard to do without the school behind you.

39
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,456
...不愿去学校
'...struggling to school as well

40
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,949
我家的8岁孩子也不愿去学校
'I have an 8-year-old struggling to school as well.'

41
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:55,033
让你的孩子去上学 这是少数人的做法
'Get your kids to school This is a tiny minority and

42
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,662
孩子需要学东西
children need to be in school in order to learn,

43
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:58,932
这很关键
that is crucial.

44
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,739
然而 早期的干预不够迅速来...
'However, the early intervention isn't as quick to... '

45
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:03,959
这种被处罚的局面很难被扭转
'It's hard to turn it over, being fined.

46
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,173
孩子们从中学不到任何东西
Kids are not learning anything by that.

47
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,240
他们知道我们会付钱的 所以他们会提起
'They know we're going to pay so they gonna mention it.

48
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:11,658
他们觉得很高兴
They find it hilarious.

49
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:15,033
在报纸上读到他们...
'You know, reading about themselves in the papers... '

50
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:18,278
就在这附近
It's up here somewhere.

51
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:21,529
在十字路口处左转
'At the traffic lights, turn left.'

52
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:31,033
上帝啊
Jesus!

53
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,696

55
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:58,982

No way!

56
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:16,274
抱歉
Excuse me?

57
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:18,484

A bit past their bedtime, isn't it?

62
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,611
是的 小东西们一定累坏了
Yeah, poor things must be exhausted.

63
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:41,525
小孩需要个好的...
That child needs a good...

64
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,065
我他妈告诉你了
I bloody told you!

Mug!

142
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,793
我们为什么不再找个地方呢
Why don't we just find another spot?

143
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,690
我不能被一群12岁的小孩吓住了
I won't be bullied by a bunch of 12-year-olds.

144
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,947
那就让这事毁了我们的下午?
And let it ruin our afternoon?

145

我们先来的
We were here first.

146
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:16,045
这就让人舒心了
Well, this is relaxing

147
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,710
你在做什么      滚开
What are you doing?        Fuck off!

148
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,920

Why? Why?

149

What's with you, you tit?        You're the tit!

151
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,086
你看她干什么
What are you looking at her for?

152
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,053
我没看她的脸 看她的奶头
I'm not looking at her face, just her tits.

153
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,750
她是个丑婊子
She's an ugly bint.

154
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,921
是的 想要我签名吗
Yeah, do you want my autograph?

155
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:34,956

Happy now? Hmm?

156
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,959
嘿 珍妮
Hey, Jenny!

157
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:55,631
快了
Nearly!

158
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,665
想再喝点啤酒吗
Fancy another brewski?

159
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,874
是的 为什么不呢
Yeah, why not?

160
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,498
史蒂夫 那是什么
Steve, what's that?

161
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,498
没什么
It's nothing.

162
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,411
天黑后没什么可做
There's not much to do after dark.

163
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,007

166
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:11,165
你喜欢吗      我觉得很漂亮
Do you like it?        I think it's beautiful.

167
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:27,079
史蒂芬・泰勒
Stephen Taylor...

168
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,205
那是什么声音
What's that noise?

169
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,996
风声而已
It's just the wind.

170
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:43,038
不 不是风声
No, that's not the wind.

171

Could be a fox.

172

我去看看      不 别走 去吧
I'll go take a look.        No, don't go... Go.

176

Get off!        I'm really sorry.

186
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,618
你冻透了      那就暖暖我
Ow! You're freezing!        Then warm me up.

187
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,494

219

如果人人都这么说 我们的处境会怎样
If everyone said that, where would we be?

220

Are you sure?        Yeah, I'm sure.
