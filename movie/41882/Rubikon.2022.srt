00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:53,555
风险是什么?
What are the stakes?

140
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:54,889
Debit-points。
Debit-points.

141
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:55,990
好吧。
Okay.

142
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,603
达尼洛!-嗯?
-Danilo! -Uh-huh?

143
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:11,172
你能给瓦格纳指挥官一块蛋糕吗?
Can you give commander Wagner a piece of cake, please?

144
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,806
谢谢你！
Thank you.

145
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:19,581
抱歉，指挥官，我儿子……被取消有点私人恩怨。
Sorry, commander, my son takes this whole... being called off thing a bit personally.

146
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,517
你呢?
And what about you?

147
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:25,620
我只是想看看你玩什么类型的游戏。
I just want to see what type of game you play.

148
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:27,589
哇，我有七个。
Whoo, I got seven.

149
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:30,057
我要带一个…不，来两杯。
I'll take one... No, make it two.

150
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,762
你喜欢吗?
Up to your liking?

151
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:38,899
他们可能习惯了不同的空气圆顶标准，对吧?
They are probably used to different standards in the air-domes, right?

152
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:45,940
如果你想补充必需的氨基酸和矿物质，恐怕就只有这些了。对不起,domer-boy。
Well, if you want your essential amino acids and minerals covered, that's all you get, I'm afraid. Sorry, domer-boy.

153
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,374
嘿，你怎么了?
Hey, what's your problem?

154
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,512
什么都没有。
Nothing.

155
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:54,649
我只是想知道是什么让一个高管的儿子想来这样的地方。达尼洛!
I just wonder what makes an executive's son -want to come to a place like this. -Danilo!

156
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:56,217
你以为是我自己选择来这里的吗?
Do you think I chose to come here?

157
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,986
和这个老垃圾?
To this old piece of junk?

158
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,121
这么说，爸爸在惩罚你?
So then, daddy is punishing you?

159
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,957
为什么?
Why?

160
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,593
你作弊了吗?
Did you misbehave?

161
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,727
这是我的作品吗?
Is that my piece?

162
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,330
谢谢你！
Thank you.

163
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,703
指挥官瓦格纳。
Commander Wagner.

164
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,770
请给我一个字。
A word, please.

165
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,678
那是什么?
What is that?

166
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,547
这是我们明天的新航线。
It's our new flight route for tomorrow.

167
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,716
什么，他们为什么改了?
What, why did they change it?

168
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,451
在北半球有一个奇怪的雾团。
There is a strange fog cluster in the northern hemisphere.

169
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:34,121
-没人知道这是什么。-超过Östgrunden领土。
- Nobody knows what it is. - Over Östgrunden territory.

170
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,190
等一下,Ostgrunden ?
Wait, Östgrunden?

171
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,292
是的，而且还发生了死亡事故。
Yes, and there have been fatalities.

172
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,362
什么?发生了什么事?
What? What happened?

173
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,164
他们还不知道。
They can't tell yet.

174
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:47,602
Östgrunden不就是他们逮捕那些绿色斗士的地方吗?
Isn't Östgrunden where they arrested those green fighters activists?

175
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,738
他们是受害者吗，绿色斗士?
Were they the victims, the green fighters?

176
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,674
有几百个。
There were a few hundred.

177
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,483
但是他们说他们可以绕着你绕一圈，对吧?
But they said they can circumnavigate you around it, right?

178
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,151
要多花半天时间。
It'll take us half a day longer.

179
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:09,591
好吧。看起来不错。所以…按计划明天晚上。
Okay. Looks good. So... tomorrow evening as planned.

180
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:10,659
好吧。
Okay.

181
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,075
来吧，告诉我点什么。
Come on, give me something.

182
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,881
你知道，我们真的不应该在这里，对吧?
You know, we're not really supposed to be in here, right?

183
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:41,922
我在网上找不到任何东西，摄像头上也没有任何记录……所以我想试试这个。
I can't find anything on the Internet, there's nothing on the cameras... so I thought I'd try this.

184
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,794
所以…就这些吗?
So... that's it?

185
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:49,830
这个没用的大气分析系统?
This atmosphere analyzing thing that never worked?

186
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,365
我都没法让它动起来。
I can't even get it to budge.

187
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,969
你可以问我的，我和尼布拉有联系。
You could have asked me, I'm in contact with Nibra.

188
00:13:56,003 --> 00:14:00,207
好吧，好像我相信一个政府公司说的话。
Right, as if I believe a single word a government company says.

189
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,076
拜托，他们不是敌人。
Come on, they're not the enemy.

190
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,812
嗯,是的,确实。是的,他们也是。
Uh, yes, actually. Yes, they are.

191
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,947
当然，如果你为他们工作就不会。
Of course, not if you work for them.

192
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,953
你担心你的朋友，是吗?
You worry for your friends, huh?

193
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,700
你很好。
You're good.

194
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:46,887
所有系统都已连接地面控制中心已发出最后指令。
All systems are online and ground control gave their final go.

195
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,888
你们准备好了吗?
You guys are ready?

196
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:48,956
是的,我们是。
Yes we are.

197
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,024
样本呢?
And the samples?

198
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:54,729
-爸爸,样本。-嗯?
-Dad, the samples. -Mmm?

199
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:56,698
哦，是的，当然。
Oh, yeah, of course.

200
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:03,470
这些母体文化会在延长的飞行时间中存活下来，对吧?
And these mother cultures will endure the extended flight time, right?

201
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:05,939
当然。当然,是的。
-Of course. -Of course, yes.

202
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:10,712
是的…这是我们的槽。我们走吧。
Yeah... That's our slot. Let's go.

203
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:13,280
指挥官瓦格纳。
Commander Wagner.

204
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:15,784
詹森!
Jensen!

205
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,542
再见我的朋友。
Goodbye my friend.

206
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,167
那么……谢谢你！
Well then... Thank you.

207
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,917
别让他们抓到你。
Don't let them catch you.

208
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,542
-请小心。——我知道。
- Please be careful. - I know.

209
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,833
好吧。
Alright.

210
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,917
-愿主与你同在。-我宁愿把他留在这儿陪你。
- May the Lord be with you. - I'd rather leave him up here with you.

211
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,375
这一点都不好笑，丹尼洛。一点都不好笑。
That's not funny, Danilo. Not funny at all.

212
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,208
-到达后联系我。——好的。
- Contact me once you've arrived. - Will do.

213
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:18,580
带着母体文化的儿子也快出生了，但我很确定他们也被操纵了。
The son is on the way now with the mother cultures, but I'm pretty sure they've been manipulated as well.

214
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:22,316
计划有变。
Well, there's been a change of plans.

215
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,753
委员会决定我们要尽早进入IKARUS。
The committee decided that we want to move on to IKARUS sooner.

216
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:28,556
已经决定了,什么时候?
Already, when?

217
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,725
显然是在接下来的几天。
Apparently in the next few days.

218
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:34,662
什么?但我还没能研究藻类的呼吸循环。
What? But I haven't been able to investigate on the algaes breathing cycle.

219
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:36,898
然后你必须更快地搜索才能准时到达。
Then you have to search faster to make it on time.

220
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:39,667
如果他发现了，他可能会销毁样本。
If he finds out, he might destroy samples.

221
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,569
准备好不被发现的小鹿。
Prepare IKARUS unnoticed then.

222
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:47,742
看，车站和藻类的交织比预期的要多。
Look, the station seems more interwoven with the algae than anticipated.

223
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,947
可能会更复杂…瓦格纳，准备好IKARUS。
It could be more complicated to just... Wagner, just prepare IKARUS.

224
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:02,517
希望你知道，他们中的一些人刚刚暴露在高水平的宇宙辐射中。
Hope you know that some of them were just exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation.

225
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,218
我得到了非常全面的指导。
I got instructed on them very thoroughly.

226
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,622
哦,好,好。
Oh, good, good.

227
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:14,062
所以你知道未经训练的人员在没有监督的情况下进入会发生什么吗?
So you are aware of what might happen when untrained personnel enters without supervision?

228
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,030
-别担心我。嗯。
-Don't worry about me. -Hmm.

229
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:23,738
听起来紧迫。
Sounds urgent.

230
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,178
他们已经着陆了吗?
Have they already landed?

231
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,747
不，他们还在运输途中。
No, they're still in transit.

232
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,618
rubkon呼叫灶神二号，你有什么要求?
Rubikon to Vesta 2, what's your request?

233
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:39,152
卢比刚!你能听到我们吗?
Rubikon! You can hear us?

234
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,056
我们都快瞎了!我们联系不上。
We-We're running blind here! We can't get contact.

235
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,925
无论是对地面控制还是对任何人。
Neither to ground control nor to anyone.

236
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,760
电台还在发送我们的信号吗?
Is the station still transmitting our signal?

237
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,427
简森,冷静下来。
Jenson, calm down.

238
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,496
我会和他们联系，然后马上给你答复。
I'll contact them and get back to you at once.

239
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,467
卢比肯呼叫地面控制?
Rubikon to ground control?

240
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:57,005
地面控制中心，收到吗?
Ground control, do you read?

241
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,744
Rubikon呼叫Nibra North。
Rubikon to Nibra North.

242
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,350
卢比刚呼叫Nibvision。
Rubikon to Nibvision.

243
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:12,620
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

244
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:14,789
我们还不知道。
We don't know yet.

245
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,458
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?

246
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,260
简森吗?-瓦格纳，是的，告诉我。
-Jenson? -Wagner, yes, tell me.

247
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,229
他们怎么说的?
What'd, what did they say?

248
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,899
我们也联系不上。
We can't make contact either.

249
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:27,300
你在开玩笑吧?这不可能是真的。
What are you kidding me? That can't be true.

250
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:31,105
我们试过所有的中转站，但没有人接电话。
We tried all staging posts but no one was answering.

251
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:33,941
简森，那Navicon呢?你收到了吗?
Jenson, what about Navicon? Are you receiving that?

252
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:37,578
就像你在灶神一号上一样。
It stopped just like yours in the Vesta 1.

253
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:40,982
等等，所以他们必须在没有任何地面人工智能的情况下降落?
Wait, so they would have to land without any ground AI?

254
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,084
他们受过这方面的训练吗?
Wh-- Are they trained for that?

255
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:44,619
我是说，我们没接受过这方面的训练。
I-- I mean, we weren't trained for that.

256
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:48,089
别——别担心，他们……他们的课程是预先设定好的。
Don't-- Don't worry, they... The... Their course is preprogrammed.

257
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:49,389
指挥官?
Right, Commander?

258
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:50,792
-是的。-是的。
-Yes. -Yes.

259
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,760
他们还要多久才能进入轨道?
How much time until they enter orbit?

260
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,194
还有54分钟。
Fifty four minutes from now.

261
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:57,497
好了，简森，我们这就去。
Okay, Jenson, we're on it.

262
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,399
我们会找到办法让你与地面连接。
We're gonna find a solution to get your connection to ground.

263
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:02,537
-别担心，好吗?-汉娜，快点。
- Don't worry, okay? - Hannah, hurry, please.

264
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,043
医生，给所有站发紧急信号。
Doctor, send an emergency signal to all stations.

265
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,145
即使是其他公司的电台，我也不在乎。
Even other company stations, I don't care.

266
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,412
加文，你跟我来。
Gavin, you come with me.

267
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,249
也许他们没有收到我们的信号。
Maybe they aren't receiving our signal.

268
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,985
我们得检查一下光学元件。
We have to check the optical unit.

269
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:25,093
- 0.75巴   -检查完毕
- Point seven five bar. - Check complete.

270
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,478
爸爸，你找到人了吗?
Dad, have you reached anyone yet?

271
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,580
没有。
Negative.

272
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,750
该死
Shit.

273
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:48,916
我们即将进入大气层。
We're about to enter atmosphere.

274
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,019
好消息是，你完全在轨道上。
Uh, good news are, you are exactly on course.

275
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:54,622
是的，但前提是在没有参数改变的情况下，对吧?
Yes, but only if no parameters change on the way, right?

276
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:58,126
等等，等等。
Hold on there, hold on there.

277
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,193
你会没事的。
You'll be fine.

278
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:04,091
你看到了吗，汉娜?
Do you see it, Hannah?

279
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,797
我对……五米之外。
I'm about... five meters away.

280
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,882
她做的怎么样?
How's she doing?

281
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,884
重要器官。
Vitals okay.

282
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:32,452
心跳有点加快，但这是正常的。
Heartbeat slightly increased, but that's normal.

283
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:51,339
我们收到测试信号了吗?
Do we get the test signal?

284
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,511
加文?
Gavin?

285
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:01,115
我们正在失去……
We're losing...

286
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:09,090
医生Kry——简森?五月天!五月天!五月天!
-Doctor Kry-- Jenson? -Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

287
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:11,192
——任何人!-简森，怎么了?
-To anyone! -Jenson, what's going on?

288
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,425
太空舱无法控制地升温!
The capsule is heating up uncontrollably!

289
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,928
我们要被烧毁了!
We're going to burn up!

290
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:16,297
加文，你听到了吗?

291
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,633
-蛋壳要破了!——达尼洛!

灶神星2 !——达尼洛!
-Vesta 2! - Danilo!

295
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:30,443
达尼洛!达尼洛，怎么了?
Danilo! Danilo, what's going on?

296
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:40,955
加文?加文，下面怎么了?
Gavin? Gavin, what's going on down there?

297
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:42,023
简森吗?
Jenson?

298
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:22,697
快点，开门!
Come on, open up!

299
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,667
来吧!
Come on!

300
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,270
他妈的!
Fuck!

301
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:44,518
那不是我们的信号。
It wasn't our signal.

302
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:48,556
在那里，一切都……汉娜。船员。
Down there everything is... Hannah. The-- the crew.

303
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,623
我知道。

304
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,631
卢比肯呼叫地面控制中心。
Rubikon to ground control.

305
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,002
有人听到我们吗?
Does anybody hear us?

306
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:06,607
卢比刚到地面。
Rubikon to ground.

307
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,144
有人吗?
Anyone?

308
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,167
该死的,汉娜!你为什么不接电话?
Damn it, Hannah! Why aren't you answering?

309
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,000
我们正在去尼伯维恩的路上。
We're on our way to Nibvision right now.

310
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,167
他们正在撤出所有部队。他们所有人。

一片混乱。

313

我们要去北边的掩体撤离。

我到了那里会给你打电话，但我不能保证什么。
I will try to call you when I get there, but I can't promise anything.

315
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:55,792
当心我会试着去……
Take care. I'll try to get...

316
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,915
简森?
Jenson?

317
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:23,484
求救!

——任何人!-简森，怎么了?
- To anyone! -  -Jenson, what's going on?

太空舱无法控制地升温!

加文?
Gavin?

323
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,135
灶神星2 ?
Vesta 2?

324
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,903
达尼洛!达尼洛，怎么了?
Danilo! Danilo, what's going on?

325
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,944
对不起，我忘了开门。
Sorry, I forgot the door.

326
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:03,592
已经两天了，我还没联系上任何人。
It's been two days and I haven't been able to reach anyone.

327
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,129
无论从哪个方向，激光都无法穿透雾气。
The lasers can't get through the fog in either direction.

328
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:12,466
它会和Östgrunden一样吗?
Could it be the same as in Östgrunden?

329
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,035
那么快就传遍全球?
Spreading across the globe that quickly?

330
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,539
不，那需要几个月，不是几天。
No that would take months, not days.

331
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,545
我想我们会注意到陨石或火山。
Well, I think we would have noticed a meteorite or a volcano.

332
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,053
如果它之前就在那里呢?
And what if it was there before?

333
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:36,457
在大气中，只是还看不见?
In the atmosphere and just not visible yet?

334
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,726
你是说我们来这里时的Navicon问题吗?
You mean the Navicon problem when we came up here?

335
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:46,834
不。我也想过这个问题，但是——这就是为什么我一直在试图理解这个古老的大气分析仪。
Nah. I've thought about that too, but-- That's why I've been trying to understand this old atmosphere analyzer... thing.

336
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,135
怎么样了?
And how's that going?

337
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,271
啧啧……真的很好。
Tsk... Really good.

338
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:53,274
到目前为止，我只发现它可以在没有连接的情况下工作。
So far, I only found out that it works without a connection.

339
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:56,076
好。继续试。
Well. Keep trying.

340
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,689
Krylow博士吗?
Dr. Krylow?

341
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:11,158

我给你带了点吃的。
I brought you something to eat.

343
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:26,740
我知道你很伤心，但是…我们得谈谈藻类的事。
I know you're hurting but... We need to talk about the algae.

344
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:30,311
我们的氧气罐撑不了多久。
Our oxy tanks won't hold forever.

345
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,378
消失。
Go away.

346
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:40,254
天然气汇率有多发达?
How far developed is the gas exchange rate?

347
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:44,792
-呼吸共生是否有效?——去!
-Does the breathing symbiosis work or not? -Go away!

348
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:46,628
我们能在这上面待多久?
How long can we stay up here?

349
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,163
医生,请!
Doctor, please!

350
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:50,699
走开!
Go away!

351
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,122

加文，你能过来看看吗?
Gavin can you come and take a look at something?

353
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,332
加文!
Gavin!

354
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:32,226
哦,他妈的…他妈的,他妈的狗屎!
Oh, fuck... Shit, shit shit!

355
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,293
医生!
Doctor!

356
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:37,297
医生,帮我!

357
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,871
这是一个紧急!医生,来了!

Shit! How long?

361
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:59,420
他刚刚进入。
He just entered.

362
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:00,688
我在试着停止减压。
I'm trying to stop depressurization.

363
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:02,791
等一下。
Just a second.

364
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:07,127
嗯，在我们再次把它装满之前，它必须完全空出来。
Mhm, it has to empty completely before we can fill it up again.

365
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:09,129
不，那太长了。
No, that's, that's too long.

366
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,835
你在干什么?不!不!不!

我想绕过锁定装置。

不，不，不!你会破坏它!
No, no, no, no! You'll destroy it!

369

就等着吧。请等一等。

好的,空!现在最快的模式!

好吧，那不是撕裂。
Okay, that's not ripped.

391
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:21,194
……他没事吧?

呃，我不知道。希望如此。
Uh, I don't know. Hope so.

393

他为什么要这么做?

394
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:33,473
嗯?-他为什么要这么做?

坦白地说，我不在乎。
Frankly, I don't care.

397

你怎么了?他刚想自杀，你却不在乎?
What's wrong with you? He just tried to kill himself and you don't care?

398
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:43,618
你说什么?
Excuse me?

399
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,522
你知道吗?你这样做。
You know what? You do it.

400
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,927
什么?
What?

401
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:55,128
间谍学院没教过你吗?
They didn't teach you that at spy academy?

402

哦，是的，我知道。

-Oh, that's a big surprise. -Oh, you think I'm an idiot?

00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:13,648
我会告诉尼布拉的间谍任何事吗?不!
I'm gonna tell anything to a Nibra spy? No!

407
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,850
这不是间谍。
It's not spying.

408
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,384
他们资助了它，它属于他们。

不,不!它不属于他们。

It belongs to me.

411
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,562
它属于丹尼洛。
It belongs to Danilo.

412
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:35,903
你儿子的事我很遗憾。
I'm sorry about your son.

413
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,776
来吧，你一定累了。
Come on, you must be tired.

414
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:44,579
去睡觉吧，我能照顾他。
Just go to bed, I can take care of him.

415
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:36,831
加文?
Gavin?

416
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,868
我只闭了一秒钟眼睛。
I closed my eyes for one second.

417
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,882
嘿,加文?
Hey Gavin?

418
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,450
加文，你感觉如何?
Gavin, how-- how do you feel?

419
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:12,934
-让我检查一下你的耳朵…-放开我!
- Let me check your ear... - Get off me!

420
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:18,106
我…我很抱歉。我，我，冷静点。
I... I'm sorry. I-- I-- Calm down.

421
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,674
你不明白。
Y-You don't understand this.

422
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,776
-你需要躺下。-这雾有毒。
-You need to lay down. -This fog is toxic.

423
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:26,047
——好吗?- Th-These气溶胶…他们-冷静点。-他们都死了。
- Okay? - Th-These aerosols... They-- - Calm down. - They're all dead.

424
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,816
——好的。-他们都死了。
- Okay. - They're all dead.

425
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:33,621
没人能活下来!迪米特里……我…他们都死了。
Nobody can survive this! Dimitri... I... They're all dead.

426
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:37,390
看,看…呼吸,呼吸。深呼吸。
Look, look... Breathe, breathe. Deep breath.

427
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,493
我不能呼吸。
I can't breathe.

428
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:40,628
每个人都在那儿。
Everyone down there.

429
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:14,394
家庭吗?朋友吗?
Family? Friends?

430
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:18,498
有人在下面吗?
You have someone down there?

431
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:22,036
我的小妹妹。
My little sister.

432
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,574
对不起。
Sorry.

433
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:31,913
但这无关紧要。
But it doesn't matter.

434
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:33,981
反正我们在这里会窒息的。
We'll suffocate up here anyway.

435
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,488
我们这里是安全的。
We're safe here.

436
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,395
好吧?
Okay?

437
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:53,668
达尼洛和我…实现了与藻类的共生关系。
Danilo and I... achieved a working symbiosis with the algae.

438
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,336
我们可以生存。
We can survive.

439
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:00,942
谢谢你！
Thank you.

440
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,978
因为你告诉了一个尼布拉间谍。
For telling a Nibra spy.

441
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,915
不客气
You're welcome.

442
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:11,752
你要去哪里?
Where you going?

443
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:20,127
哇，你可真忙。
Wow, you've been busy.

444
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:24,065
即使空气有毒，也有掩体。
Even if the air is toxic, there are bunkers.

445
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:28,368
激光无法穿透迷雾，但是…也许这可以。
The lasers can't get through the fog, but... maybe this can.

446
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:30,605
我在试着让它工作。
I'm trying to get it to work.

447
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,140
这是吗?
Is this?

448
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:36,978
原来的国际空间站无线电系统，没错。
The old ISS radio system, exactly.

449
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,247
这是古老的技术。
That's ancient technology.

450
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,382
我是说，你真的认为还有人在用它吗?
I mean, do you really think anyone is still using it?

451
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,720
我会找到的。
I'll find out.

452
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:47,955
我只需要重新激活无线电天线。
I just need to reactivate the radio antenna.

453
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,457
无线电天线吗?
Radio antenna?

454
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,327
我，你一个人做不到。
I-- Well you can't do that alone.

455
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:55,062
是的,我知道。
Yeah, I know.

456
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:57,331
坐下。
Take a seat.

457
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:08,242
在扇区寻找一个电路…在部门B。
Look for a circuit in sector... in sector B.

458
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,443
你能看到吗?
Can you see it?

459
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:13,446
电缆缠结。
The cables are tangled.

460
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,617
好的,等待。
Okay, wait.

461
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:20,420
我知道了，确定。
I got it, affirmative.

462
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,023
好的，重新定向。
Okay, so redirect it.

463
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,628
你看到这些没用的东西了吗?
Have you seen all this useless crap here?

464
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:32,633
是的，我在空间站住了八年，我都见过了。
Ya, I've lived on the station for eight years, I've seen it all.

465
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:36,137
当处理旧零件的成本太高时就会发生这种情况。
That's what happens when it's too expensive to get rid of old parts.

466
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,205
你只要把它们堆在一起。
You just pile them up together.

467
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:41,474
你的主人朋友是对的。
Your domer-friend was right.

468
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,811
这个车站是个垃圾场。
This station is a junkyard.

469
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:54,121
是啊，跟我说说。
Yeah, tell me about it.

470
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:59,327
我年轻的时候，宇航员就像神一样。
When I was young, astronauts were like gods.

471
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:06,734
你年轻的时候，国家是有的，所以…好了，医生，已经接上了。
Well, when you were young, countries existed, so... Okay, Doctor, it's attached.

472
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:07,768
等待。
Wait.

473
00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:14,008
很好。顺便说一句，你不用一直叫我医生。
Very good. By the way, you don't have to call me doctor all the time.

474
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,910
我的真名是迪米特里。
My real name is Dimitri.

475
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:20,381
我觉得这里有信号了。
I think I'm getting a signal here.

476
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,317
迪米特里。
Dimitri.

477
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,322
等我一下，让我扫描一下。
Give me a second, let me scan it.

478
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:32,693
明白了。
Got it.

479
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:35,062
好吧。
Okay.

480
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:44,538
让我们试一试。
Let's give it a try.

481
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:51,879
瓦格纳指挥官降落。
Commander Wagner to ground.

482
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,021
有人能听到我吗?
Can anybody hear me?

483
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,394
请,有人知道吗?
Please, anyone?

484
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:12,967
喂?
Hello?

485
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:17,538
他妈的!
Fuck!

486
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:24,979
加文不可能是对的。
Gavin can't be right.

487
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:29,583
她不可能死了。
She can't be dead.

488
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:46,400
打开这扇门!来吧!
Open the door! Come on!

489
00:43:06,454 --> 00:43:08,055
你的耳朵痛吗?
Your ears hurt?

490
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:11,225
我，我可以给你开些止痛药，治耳朵的。
I-- I can give you some painkillers for the-- for the ears.

491
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:12,960
-我很好。我很好。你确定吗?
-I'm fine. I'm fine. -You're sure?

492
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:19,568
所以你说的话毫无疑问了吗?
So there's no doubt about what you said?

493
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:28,609
雾的气溶胶的化学结构是剧毒的。
The chemical structure of the fog's aerosols is highly toxic.

494
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:31,078
这是致命的。
It's lethal.

495
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:32,813
它们来自哪里?
Where do they come from?

496
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:38,419
我不知道，呃…对我来说，这似乎是某种……连锁反应?
I don't know, uh... To me it seems like some kind of... chain reaction?

497
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,487
从什么?
From what?

498
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,456
永冻层气体。
Permafrost gases.

499
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:49,430
我们已经警告人们很多年了而现在他们显然做出了反应。
We've been warning people about this for years And now they've obviously reacted with something.

500
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:55,537
也许是发电厂的毒素，其他污染，也许是另一场公司战争的化学武器。
Maybe Toxins from the power plants, some other pollution, maybe chemical weapons from another corporation war.

501
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,640
事实是，都在下面了。我们利用它。
Fact is it's, it's all over down there. We fucked it.

502
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:02,243
显然，经济比呼吸更重要。
Apparently, the economy was more important than breathing.

503
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:04,044
那空气圆顶呢?
And what about the air-domes?

504
00:44:04,078 --> 00:44:06,714
它们代表一个特定的分子光谱。
They are for a very specific molecular spectrum.

505
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:09,984
只有一个装有氧气罐的封闭系统才能保护他们不受雾的影响。
Only a closed system with oxygen tanks could shield them from the fog.

506
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:11,886
但也有这样的掩体。
But there are bunkers like that.

507
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:14,388
疏散的掩体。我用它们训练。
Evacuation bunkers. I trained in them.

508
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,824
那里面的人会怎么样?嗯?
And what will happen to the people in there? Hm?

509
00:44:16,857 --> 00:44:20,094
迟早，它们会耗尽食物，耗尽氧气。
Sooner or later, they'll run out of food, they'll run out of oxygen.

510
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:22,564
和我们一样。我们都只是行尸走肉。
Same as us. We're all just living corpses.

511
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:24,498
加文。-我不喜欢慢慢死去
-Gavin. -And I don't like the idea of a slow death.

512
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:27,101
我们想待多久就待多久。
We can stay here as long as we need to.

513
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:32,039
藻类气体交换起作用了。
The algae gas exchange works.

514
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:40,247
不。
No.

515
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,315
Wha?

516
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:42,883
没有?
No?

517
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:46,353
我不能这样生活。
Uh-uh, I can't live like this.

518
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:50,191
永远困在这个小金属罐里吗?
Stuck in this-- in this tiny metal can forever?

519
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:51,526
也许你们两个可以。
Maybe you two can.

520
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:56,130
-我就是做不到-是啊，那你有什么选择?
- I just can't. -  -Yeah and what is your alternative?

521
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,333
你想再试一次吗?
You wanna try it again?

522
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:07,208
看……这是你的生活，你的决定。
Look... it's your life, your decision.

523
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:11,812
我只是想让你知道，如果你再这么做，你也会杀了她。
I just want you to know that if you try it again, you will also kill her.

524
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:15,082
和我。
And me.

525
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,786
什么,为什么?
What, why?

526
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:23,157
我还没告诉你，这个系统是为六人设计的。
I didn't tell you this yet, but the system is designed for a full crew of six.

527
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,128
它们产生二氧化碳，系统将其转化为氧气。
They produce CO2 and the system converts it back into oxygen.

528
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:36,337
有效的气体交换最少需要三个人。
The bare minimum for an efficient gas exchange is three people.

529
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:40,575
加文，我们需要你的二氧化碳。
Gavin, we need your CO2.

530
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:21,248
我可以加入吗?
Can I join?

531
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:26,320
好吧。
Okay.

532
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:38,098
我生你的气，你知道吗?
I'm mad at you, you know?

533
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:43,237
谢谢你把我和这只臭脾气的老猫单独留在这里。
For leaving me alone here with this old grumpy cat.

534
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:55,282
什么?什么?
What? What?

535
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,185
什么?什么事这么好笑?
What? What's so funny?

536
00:46:58,218 --> 00:47:02,557
只是，只是我，我拼命工作。
It's-- It's just that I-- I worked my ass off.

537
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,593
Debit-point Debit-point。
Debit-point for debit-point.

538
00:47:05,627 --> 00:47:09,229
一次又一次的破任务，为了什么?
One shitty mission after another and for what?

539
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:11,800
对于这个吗?
For this?

540
00:47:14,736 --> 00:47:22,409
我可以多参加些派对，像克诺普夫那样，或者…每隔一段时间休息一天。
I could have partied more, like Knopf, or... taken a day off every once in a while.

541
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,113
是的。
Yeah.

542
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:33,454
我觉得我真的把整个人生都搞砸了。
I think I really screwed up this whole life thing.

543
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:41,128
我也一样。
Same here.

544
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:49,370
你认为我没有把自己的生活搞砸，因为我一直在抗议，不洗，不剪t恤，还有…我很高兴我现在这么做了，不是吗?
You think I was not screwing up my life, by going on protests and not washing and cutting out T-shirts and... I'm really glad I did that now, aren't I?

545
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:52,139
是的。
Yeah.

546
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:53,874
没有行星B。
There is no planet B.

547
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,179
和迪米特里。
And Dimitri.

548
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:04,118
你觉得他是和他的同事在实验室开派对吗?
Do you think he was partying in his lab with his working symbiosis?

549
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:14,395
你能想象如果地球上的人知道我们是最后三个人类会怎样吗?
Can you imagine if they knew on Earth that we were the last three humans?

550
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:15,929
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

551
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:17,665
一群失败者和怪胎。
A bunch of losers and freaks.

552
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:34,448
我和我的朋友…为一个已经不复存在的星球而奋斗。
Me and my friends... fought so hard for a planet that doesn't exist anymore.

553
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:43,858
我花了这么长时间相信一件事，现在它不……任何意义。
I have spent so long believing in something, and now it doesn't... mean anything.

554
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,532
所以这位naïve活动家走了?
So the naïve activist is gone?

555
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:58,405
嗯…他……他本来就是个白痴。
Hmm... He... He was kind of an idiot anyway.

556
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:01,743
那太糟了。
That's too bad.

557
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,612
我喜欢他。
I liked him.

558
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:50,424
迪米特里吗?
Dimitri?

559
00:49:55,262 --> 00:49:56,296
什么?
What?

560
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,298
是正常的吗?
Is that normal?

561
00:50:03,538 --> 00:50:06,340
呃，他们从来不保持完全相同的绿色。
Eh, they never keep the exact same green color.

562
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:08,643
多久?
How much longer?

563
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:10,879
这次我真的要死了。
I'm dying this time for real.

564
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:13,480
两分钟!
Two more minutes!

565
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:16,216
是的，但是，但是棕色?这是——这是奇怪的。
Yeah, but-- but brown? That's-- that's weird.

566
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:23,323
如果…不，别担心，没事的。
It can happen if, uh... No, don't worry, it's fine.

567
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:26,995
哦,他妈的…哦，不，不，不，不，不。
Oh, fuck... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

568
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:30,397
够了，我不干了。
That's it, I'm done.

569
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:32,767
他们得等到明天再看我的呼吸。
They'll have to wait for my breath until tomorrow.

570
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,103
加文，不是45分钟。
Gavin, it wasn't 45 minutes.

571
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:38,171
你知道那有多长吗?
Do-Do you even know how long that is?

572
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:40,474
不，你当然不知道，因为一直都是我和汉娜在叫卖。
No, of course you don't, 'cause it's always Hannah and me peddling.

573
00:50:40,508 --> 00:50:44,378
事实上，我知道，因为每天早上你抱我的时候，我都在叫卖。
Actually, I do know because every morning when you cuddle, I peddle.

574
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:45,980
至少45分钟。
At least 45 minutes.

575
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:47,749
也许我们应该在闭路电视上看看。
Maybe we should check that on the CCTV.

576
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:48,883
也许我们应该。
Maybe we should.

577
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,785
好吧,好吧。你说呢?
Okay, okay. What do you say?

578
00:50:51,586 --> 00:50:52,620
电影之夜吗?
Movie night?

579
00:50:53,153 --> 00:50:56,123
-当然。什么其他的吗?
-Sure. -What else?

580
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:08,135
迪米特里吗?
Dimitri?

581
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:12,574
对，选个东西。我呃……我马上就来!
Uh, yeah, choose something. I'm uh... I'll come in a second!

582
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:41,368
抱歉,各位,抱歉。
Sorry, guys, sorry.

583
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:44,204
你在等我，真好。
Oh, you waited for me, that's nice.

584
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:45,540
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

585
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:48,610
我只是…我们在看什么?
I just, uh... What are we watching?

586
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:51,311
如果你不能重新激活网络，就什么都没有。
Nothing, if you can't reactivate the Internet.

587
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:55,182
显然，我们已经到达了内部电影库的尽头。
Apparently, we've reached the end of the internal movie library.

588
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:56,249
哦……
Oh...

589
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:06,728
我可以请你喝一杯。
I can offer you a drink.

590
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:08,596
更多。更多,更多!
More. More, more!

591
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,098
更多,更多,更多!
More, more, more!

592
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,599
Hannushka,就足够了。
Hannushka, it's enough.

593
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,635
你受够了，汉努什卡。
You had enough, Hannushka.

594
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:15,803
是的,谢谢你……爸爸。
Yeah, thank you... Daddy.

595
00:52:15,837 --> 00:52:20,207
-好的……-在你所有的藻类功能中，这绝对是我最喜欢的。
-Okay... -Of all your algae's functions this is definitely my favorite.

596
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,211
是啊，这批有点太烈了。你可以看到。
Yeah, well, this batch is a bit too strong. You can see that.

597
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:31,085
如果我知道你的实验室里有一整个酿酒厂，我就…是啊，你会向妮布拉举报我的，对吧，小间谍?
If I'd known you had a whole distillery in your lab I would have just... Yeah, you would just report me to Nibra, wouldn't you, little spy?

598
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,954
是的,有可能。
Yes, probably.

599
00:52:34,922 --> 00:52:36,124
等等,什么?
Wait, what?

600
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,059
等等，你不知道?
Wait, you didn't know?

601
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:42,797
汉努什卡是尼布拉派来偷我母亲培养的。
Hannushka was sent by Nibra to steal my mother cultures.

602
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,932
这他妈不是什么，不，不是偷。
What the fuck it's not-- No, not stealing.

603
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:46,834
——偷窃。只是拿走。-偷窃是一个很难听的词。
-Not stealing. Just taking away. -Steal is a harsh word.

604
00:52:46,868 --> 00:52:48,636
把它拿走，然后去偷。
Take it away and steal.

605
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,305
-不。不。不。五周了，你现在才提这个?
-No. No. No. -Wh-- Five weeks and you're only mentioning this now?

606
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,274
我很抱歉，亲爱的。
I'm so sorry, my dear.

607
00:52:54,976 --> 00:52:56,077
把它。
Take it.

608
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,145
三。
Three.

609
00:52:58,378 --> 00:53:01,149
你，你把样本藏起来了?
You-- You were hiding the samples?

610
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:02,449
我是帮助。
I was helping.

611
00:53:04,052 --> 00:53:07,588
几个月前，尼布拉改变了他们的合同。
A few months ago, Nibra changed their contract.

612
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:12,325
突然间，他们想让这个系统只在他们的空气穹顶上使用。
Suddenly they wanted the system to be exclusive for their air-domes.

613
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,227
和…我不介意。
And... I wouldn't mind.

614
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:17,464
我会收下那笔钱，那可是一大笔钱。
I would have taken the money, which was a lot of money.

615
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:19,901
贪婪的操。
Greedy fuck.

616
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:22,770
呃?是啊，而且并不为此感到羞耻。
Uh? Yeah, and not ashamed of it.

617
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:25,305
但是达尼洛,没有。
But Danilo, no.

618
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:27,141
他非常愤怒。
He was furious.

619
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:30,144
他决定让它成为公共领域。
He decided to make it a public domain.

620
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:34,381
他发现了什么秘密，我不知道，经销商。
He found some secret, I don't know, distributor.

621
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:38,418
听起来是个好人。
Huh, actually sounds like a good guy.

622
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:43,457
非常烦人，固执，粗鲁。
Extremely annoying, stubborn, rude.

623
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:45,860
有点像你。
A little bit like you.

624
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:51,498
厚脸皮的做好事的混蛋，是吧?
Cheeky little do-gooder shit, huh?

625
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,035
对不起。
Sorry.

626
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:59,607
谢谢你！你知道的。
Thank you... you know.

627
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,477
好了，好了，让我看看你们的本事。
Okay, okay, show me what you got, boys.

628
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,747
呃，是的，这是垃圾。
Ugh, yeah this is garbage.

629
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,582
-不!-现在你走了。
-No! -Now you are gone.

630
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,518
他妈的-砰。-不,加文!
What the f-- -Boom. -No, Gavin!

631

- Ooh... - Fuck off, I-- No, I am-- -Hannushka, Hannushka, stop it. -No! Okay, I'm... no.

632
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:21,696
不!你们两个应该为清理穷人感到羞耻。
No! And you two should be so fucking ashamed cleaning out the poor.

633
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:26,901
我要跳舞，否则我就会死。
I need to dance or I'll die.

634
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,502
哦,不。
Oh, no.

635
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:43,117
加文!和女人跳舞。
Gavin! Dance with the woman.

636
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:45,385
来吧,跳舞。

637
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:48,355
-来吧，小情人。-请,不。

638
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:51,793
-请…来吧……来吧。来吧!
-Please... -Come... Come on. Come on!

639
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:54,461
移动臀部，移动臀部。
Move the hips, move the hips.

640
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:57,732
不!我觉得你应该请迪米特里跳舞。
No! I think-- I think you should get Dimitri to dance.

641
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:01,002
——哦,明白了!-不，不!
- Oh, gotcha! - Oh, no, no!

642
00:55:01,035 --> 00:55:06,007

你绝对，绝对醉到可以跳舞了。
You're definitely, definitely drunk enough to dance.

644
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:08,441
来吧。停下。

如果还有其他人，请回答。
If anyone else is out there, please answer.

If you can hear us, please respond.

650

嘿,加文!加文,醒醒!
Hey Gavin! Gavin, wake up!

653
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:57,251
拜托，激光通讯又正常了，我，我和一个幸存者谈过了。
Come on, the laser comm worked again, I-- I talked to one of the survivors.

654
00:56:57,285 --> 00:57:00,354

是的,好,好……
Yeah, good, great...

658

卢比肯呼叫幸存者，能听到我们吗?
Rubikon to survivors, can you hear us?

659
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:22,310
喂?瓦格纳指挥官吗?这东西好用吗?
Hello? Commander Wagner? Is this thing working?

660
00:57:22,343 --> 00:57:24,178
哦,上帝。

我们很高兴听到你的声音。
And we're happy to hear your voice.

我们这里差不多有300人。

666
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:41,562
发生袭击了吗?

667
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:42,964
老实说，我们不知道。
Honestly, we don't know.

668

雾来的太突然了，人们开始咳嗽、呕吐，真是……但士兵们把我们带进了地堡。
The fog came so suddenly and people started coughing and dropping, it was... But the soldiers brought us into the bunker.

669
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,842
但你是安全的，不是吗?

670
00:57:56,177 --> 00:57:57,712
不，是氧。

我们剩下的不多了。
We don't have much left.

672
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:04,819
但我猜克雷洛的藻类系统阻止了你，对吧?
But I guess Krylow's algae system is preventing that for you, right?

673
00:58:07,655 --> 00:58:11,058
你是怎么知道藻类的?
How do you know about the algae?

674
00:58:11,092 --> 00:58:14,395
我们中的一些人对这个有前途的项目持有股份。
Well, some of us own stock in this promising project.

675
00:58:14,428 --> 00:58:16,496

还有他们的家人，是的。
And their families, yes.

677
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,904
你们当中有兰德尔·艾博特吗?
Is there a Randall Abbot amongst you?

678
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:28,009
对不起,没有。
I'm sorry, no.

679
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:37,218
但是，这些藻类…体制为你提供了条件，对吧?
But, so these algae... The system provides for you, right?

680
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:39,320
克雷洛医生成功了吗?
I mean, Dr. Krylow made that work?

681
00:59:48,055 --> 00:59:49,623
迪米特里吗?
Dimitri?

682
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:51,425
H-He的在这里。
H-He's in here.

683
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,562
汉娜是正确的。
Hannah was right.

684
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:55,729
有近300名幸存者。
There are survivors, almost 300.

685
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:57,898
真的吗?
Really?

686
00:59:57,932 --> 00:59:59,667
是的，但更好。
Yeah, but even better.

687
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,470
在雾中有这些开口。
There are these openings in the fog.

688
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:04,705
非常小，但仍然是。
Very small ones, but still.

689
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:09,877
——嗯。-所以他们能听到我们
- Hmm. -  -That's why they could hear us.

690
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:13,481
他们已经转移了地堡的坐标。
They've already managed to transfer their bunker's coordinates.

691
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:14,882
下一步将是灶神星。
The next step would be the Vesta.

692
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:19,186
有了加文的大气分析，我可能会手动降落。
With Gavin's atmosphere analysis I might manage to fly down manually.

693
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,390
——做什么?-他们的地堡最多能提供三周的氧气。
-To do what? -Their bunker provides enough oxygen for three more weeks at best.

694
01:00:23,424 --> 01:00:25,527
-嗯。如果……
-Mm-hmm. -If...

695
01:00:27,828 --> 01:00:30,898
如果我们能把你的藻类带到那里，我们就能帮助他们。
If we could bring your algae down there, we could help them.

696
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:37,271
-好的。-听着，它们应该滋养一个封闭的系统。
-Okay. -Look, they're supposed to nourish a closed system.

697
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:40,174
不管下面是掩体还是上面是卢比肯。
It doesn't matter if it's a bunker down there or the Rubikon up here.

698
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:45,379
等一下。你是说我们不带导航图标就飞过去吗?
Hold on one second. So, you're suggesting we fly down without Navicon?

699
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:46,814
是的。
Yes.

700
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:54,021
我们可以拯救300条生命。
We could save three hundred lives.

701
01:00:54,054 --> 01:00:55,624
我们认为这是一个值得冒的风险。
We think it's a risk worth taking.

702
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,725
假设我们，我们到达了地球。
Let's say we, we make it to Earth.

703
01:00:57,758 --> 01:01:00,794
-我们怎么去地堡?-他们有机动氧气罐。
-How do we get to the bunkers? -They have mobile oxy-tanks.

704
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:03,764
他们可以来接我们，还有尼布拉实验室的设备。
They could pick us up, also the equipment from the Nibra Lab.

705
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:06,400
离我们降落的地方很近。
It's pretty close to where we'd land.

706
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:10,371
看来你都想通了。
Oh, it seems like you've figured it all out.

707
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:14,942
伟大的……如果我说不呢?
Great... So what if I say no?

708
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,680
什么?Wh-Why吗?
What? Wh-Why?

709
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:24,251
你知道，这有点不负责任。
You know, it's-- it's a little irresponsible.

710
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:27,188
而且非常非常愚蠢。
And very, very stupid.

711
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,924
不带导航图标就飞下来?你们疯了吗?
Flying down without Navicon? Are you out of your minds?

712
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:32,826
那我们怎么办，什么都不做吗?我们就看着他们死去?
So what, we do-- we do nothing? We just watch them die?

713
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,263
-你真的那么自私吗?你能不能别再说什么绿色战斗机了?
-Are you really that selfish? -Ca-Can you stop with this green fighter bullshit?

714
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:38,098
这不是你的意识项目。
It's not one of your awareness projects.

715
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:40,801
我们必须尽力帮忙。我们有道德责任。
We have to help if we can. We have a moral responsibility.

716
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:44,471
我唯一的道德责任就是让你们俩活着。
My only moral responsibility is to keep you and you alive.

717
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:46,675
——就是这样。-这不是达尼洛想要的吗?
-That's it. -Isn't this what Danilo would have wanted?

718
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:47,676
帮助人们吗?
To help people?

719
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,877
是的,他做到了。
Yes, he did.

720
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,945
现在他死了。
And now he's dead.

721
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,983
但我在这里说，“他们真倒霉。”
But I'm here and I say, "tough luck to them."

722
01:01:57,586 --> 01:02:00,120
我现在知道了如何创造母亲文化。
I know now how to make mother cultures.

723
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:03,057
所以我们不需要你的帮助。
So, we don't need your help.

724
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,526
你不能碰它们。
You're not gonna touch them.

725
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:05,560
-你明白我的意思吗?
-Hey -You understand what I'm saying?

726
01:02:05,594 --> 01:02:06,827
你不许碰它!
You're not gonna touch it!

727
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,862
停!说真的,你们。
Stop! Seriously, you guys.

728
01:02:09,964 --> 01:02:11,732
坐下，你们两个。
Sit down, both of you.

729
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:25,879
我们必须做出决定。
We have to make a decision.

730
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:30,017
这真的说不通。
It really doesn't make sense.

731
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,919
来吧，我们很好。
Come on, we are fine.

732
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,454
我们在这里很好。
We are good here.

733
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:36,190
我们，我们想待多久就待多久。
We, we can stay here as long as we want.

734
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:39,661
真的吗?这是你的计划吗?
Really? That's your plan?

735
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:42,664
这么长时间你在实验室里完全疯了吗?
Have you gone completely crazy in that lab all this time?

736
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:45,567
你没资格跟我说什么疯狂，先生。
You don't get to talk to me about crazy, mister.

737
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,702
想自杀的不是我。
I am not the one who tried to kill himself.

738
01:02:47,736 --> 01:02:50,104
你到底有多想再来一次?
How desperately are you trying to do it again?

739
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:52,306
真的吗?你要去那里?
Really? You're gonna go there?

740
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:54,475
我还没跟你说完呢。
Hey, I'm not done talking to you.

741
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:57,311
嘿,嘿!回来!来,达尼洛!
Hey, Hey! Come back! Come-- Danilo!

742
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:12,727
你没事吧?
You okay?

743
01:03:13,595 --> 01:03:14,696
没什么,这是……
Nothing, it's...

744
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:21,736
嘿,嘿,嘿。你没事吧?
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

745
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:28,075
没什么，只是，我猜是你的杜松子酒。
It's nothing, it's just-- It's just your schnapps, I guess.

746
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:40,087
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

747
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,823
只是预防措施，只是想确保一切正常。
Just a precaution, just want to make sure everything is fine.

748
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,659
谢谢你！
Thank you.

749
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:48,162
你知道，他是对的。
He's right, you know.

750
01:03:48,195 --> 01:03:50,632
如果他们是地球上最后的人类怎么办?
What if those are the last people on the planet?

751
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:55,936
好。
Well.

752
01:03:55,969 --> 01:04:04,411
如果他们是地球上最后的人类，也许从头开始并不是一个坏主意。
If these are the last people on the planet Earth, maybe it's not that bad of an idea, to start it all from scratch.

753
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:07,181
迪米特里,来吧。
Dimitri, come on.

754
01:04:07,214 --> 01:04:16,624
好吧。告诉我，这些人，这些可爱的ceo，为你做过什么?
Okay. Tell me, what have these people, these lovely CEOs, ever done for you?

755
01:04:18,258 --> 01:04:19,893
他们把我从泥土里救了出来。
They got me out of the dirt.

756
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:22,664
嗯。
Hm.

757
01:04:22,697 --> 01:04:27,802
让你成为一名士兵，在他们的军队里为他们服务。
Yeah and made you a soldier to serve them in their army.

758
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:29,537
你做了什么?
You done?

759
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:49,056
睡不着吗?
Can't sleep?

760
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:57,030
是她吗，克诺夫?
Is that her, Knopf?

761
01:04:58,132 --> 01:04:59,734
她的真名是米娅。
Her real name is Mia.

762
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:05,005
这是我从她那里得到的最后一条信息。
This is the last message I got from her.

763
01:05:05,038 --> 01:05:07,207
我想知道她当时在哪里。
I'm trying to find out where she was.

764
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,845
好吧?
Okay?

765
01:05:10,879 --> 01:05:14,682
诺普夫驻扎在距离尼布拉中心掩体五小时路程的地方。
Knopf was stationed five hours away from the Nibra central bunker.

766
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:19,821
那个地区还有其他地堡，而且……她也收到了疏散令。
There are other bunkers in that area and... she got an evacuation order too.

767
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:23,290
也就是说她可能还活着?
That means she could still be alive?

768
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,327
汉娜，你为什么不告诉我?
Hannah, why didn't you tell me?

769
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:31,365
因为这很愚蠢。
'Cause it's-- it's stupid.

770
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,269
机会这么小。
It's such a small chance.

771
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,441
我们正准备出发。
We're preparing for departure.

772
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:16,977
你能帮我们装母质吗?
Will you help us load the mother cultures?

773
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:28,422
迪米特里，你要么跟我们走，要么…或者你留下。
Dimitri, either you come with us or... Or you stay.

774
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:43,036
什么?这里也有吗?呃，不，不，不要说我们现在失去他们了。
What? In here as well? Eh-- No, no, don't say we're losing them now.

775
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,205
这是让我们留下来的诡计吗?
Is this a trick, to make us stay?

776
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:47,107
不，这不是恶作剧。
No, it's not a trick.

777
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,610
它真的发生了。
It's really happening.

778
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,278
在整个车站。
In the whole station.

779
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:54,014
他们生病了吗?
Are they sick?

780
01:06:54,047 --> 01:06:55,750
我也是这么想的。
That's what I thought.

781
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:58,051
那又怎样?我们不能把他们打倒还是?
So what? We can't bring them down or?

782
01:06:58,085 --> 01:06:59,119
迪米特里。
Dimitri.

783
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:06,159
——是你。-我让他们走…没有你的监督我是不会碰它们的。
-It's you. -I make them go... I don't even touch them without your supervision.

784
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,095
你不需要碰它们。
You don't need to touch them.

785
01:07:08,128 --> 01:07:12,600
它们在空间站的营养循环中以我们的尿液为食。
They feed from our urine in the station's nutrient cycle.

786
01:07:12,634 --> 01:07:15,937
所以它们变色是因为汉娜的尿吗?
So they've changed color because of Hannah's pee?

787
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:17,872
完全正确。
Exactly.

788
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:23,711
是啊，是啊，你差点就骗到我了。
Yeah, yeah, you almost got me.

789
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:25,813
来吧。
Come on.

790
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:29,851
藻类对激素极其敏感。
The algae is extremely sensitive to hormones.

791
01:07:29,884 --> 01:07:31,886
这是你体内高水平的HCG造成的。
It's your high levels of HCG that do it.

792
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,589
不，士兵不能怀孕。
No, soldiers can't get pregnant.

793
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:36,223
我们连月经都没有。
We don't even get our periods.

794
01:07:36,256 --> 01:07:38,760
在我的职责结束前，我是不育的。
I'm-- I'm sterile till the end of my duty.

795
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:44,632
除非你的激素诱导剂和控制装置失去联系足够长时间。
Unless your hormone inducer loses connection with its control unit for a long enough time.

796
01:07:55,142 --> 01:07:57,411
但是藻类没有问题，对吧?
But the algae is fine, right?

797
01:07:57,444 --> 01:07:58,646
我们不会失去它?
We won't lose it?

798
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:01,415
藻类很好。
The algae is fine.

799
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,721
另一方面呢?
That, on the other hand?

800
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:08,288
如果我们飞下来…
If we fly down...

801
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:16,463
这些人需要我们的帮助。
These people need our help.

802
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:17,532
来吧。
Come on.

803
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:22,036
等,汉娜,等。
Wait, Hannah, wait.

804
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,337
停止。
Stop.

805
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,471
搞什么，伙计?
What the fuck, dude?

806
01:08:24,505 --> 01:08:26,774
他说得对，他说得对。
He's right, he's right.

807
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:28,375
请。
Please.

808
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:31,679
开始加载母体培养。
Start loading the mother cultures.

809
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:33,113
明天我们要离开。
We're leaving tomorrow.

810
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:35,382
我来准备灶神星。
I'll prepare the Vesta.

811
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:36,918
汉娜。
Hannah.

812
01:08:39,386 --> 01:08:40,420
汉娜!
Hannah!

813
01:08:57,639 --> 01:09:01,208
大便。来吧。
Shit. Come on.

814
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,255
一遍吗?
Again?

815
01:09:15,288 --> 01:09:18,392
你可能没注意到，我刚杀了我们俩。
In case you didn't notice, I-- I just killed us.

816
01:09:18,425 --> 01:09:20,561
所以,是的,一次。
So, yeah, again.

817
01:09:20,595 --> 01:09:22,864
是啊，但其他八次你都成功了。
Yeah, but the other eight times you made it.

818
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:28,836
你只是累了，就这样。
You're just getting tired, that's all.

819
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:34,709
你给我的飞行通道太狭窄了。
This flight corridor you gave me is fucking narrow.

820
01:09:34,742 --> 01:09:37,477
那他们该庆幸坐在座位上的是你。
Well, then they're lucky that it's you sitting in the seat.

821
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:49,957
汉娜，我真的觉得我们应该谈谈…关于这一切。
Hannah, I really think we should talk about the... about all this.

822
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:51,626
这意味着什么呢?
What does this mean now?

823
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:54,028
没有，这意味着什么。
Nothing, this means nothing.

824
01:09:55,863 --> 01:09:56,898
汉娜……
Hannah...

825
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:05,673
是不是很可能别说了，好吗?我…不!他妈的。
isn't it likely that-- Stop it, okay? I... No! Fuck.

826
01:10:07,175 --> 01:10:11,478
我会在重返大气层或者着陆的时候或者没有空间站的辐射罩的时候失去它。
I'm going to lose it at re-entry or landing or without the station's radiation shield.

827
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:13,748
好吧，这真是太操蛋了。
Okay, that's-- that's super fucked up, yeah.

828
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:19,286
抱歉，我，我不是故意的
Sorry, I-- I didn't mean to--

829
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:25,325
反正也没机会了，我是说，就算我们留下来。
It has no chance anyway, I mean, even if we stayed.

830
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:26,961
我不能在这里养孩子。
I can't raise a baby here.

831
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:30,464
只有你，我和迪米特里?
Just you, me and Dimitri?

832
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,168
这改变不了什么。
This changes nothing.

833
01:10:34,202 --> 01:10:36,236
这只会让事情变得更糟。
It just makes the whole situation shittier.

834
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:40,908
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

835
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:43,644
我真的害怕。
I really am.

836
01:10:50,283 --> 01:10:55,223
听着，这个可能没机会了。
Look, this one probably doesn't have a chance.

837
01:10:55,255 --> 01:11:00,027
但是，当我们在那里的时候…你是说你想和我生个孩子吗?
But, when we're down there... Are you saying you want a baby with me?

838
01:11:03,363 --> 01:11:04,397
为什么不呢?
Why not?

839
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:07,835
我的意思是,想象。
I mean, imagine.

840
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,105
会踢屁股。
It'd kick butt.

841
01:11:11,139 --> 01:11:13,941
我的大脑，你的肌肉。
My brains, your muscles.

842
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,009
是的。
Yeah.

843
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:20,782
是啊，你说得对，我真的太累了。
Yeah, you're right, I'm-- I'm definitely too tired for this.

844
01:11:23,518 --> 01:11:25,953
十次中有八次着陆就够了，对吧?
Eight landings out of ten must be enough, right?

845
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,374
好吧，给我最后一个。
Okay, bring me the last one.

846
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:27,215
这真的够300人吃吗?
And this is really enough for 300 people?

847
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:31,619
是的，这是最低金额。
Yep, that's the minimum amount.

848
01:12:33,254 --> 01:12:34,789
什么?
What?

849
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:37,091
你又觉得我在骗你吗?
Again, you think I'm tricking you or something?

850
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:46,934
只是，你一整天都没说过一句反抗的话。
It's just, you've not said one word of resistance the whole day.

851
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:48,703
什么……你想从我这里得到什么?
What... What do you want from me?

852
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:54,876
你以为我会蠢到带着没用的海藻菌飞下来吗?
You think I'm stupid enough to fly down with algae cultures that don't work?

853
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:57,845
我是说，没有你们俩我待不下去了。
I mean, I can't stay here without you two.

854
01:12:57,879 --> 01:13:01,481
所以,你赢了。祝贺你。
So, you won. Congratulations.

855
01:13:02,617 --> 01:13:04,252
你还想从我这里得到什么?
What else do you want from me?

856
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:17,231
好了，检查完毕。
Okay, all checks are done.

857
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:19,300
你准备好了吗?
Are you ready for this?

858
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:22,370
不。
Nope.

859
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:24,939
完美的。
Perfect.

860
01:13:24,972 --> 01:13:27,208
灶神一号，收到飞行走廊。
Vesta 1, flight corridor received.

861
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:31,579
尼布拉中心，92分钟后再联系你。
Central Nibra, contacting you again in 92 minutes.

862
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:38,886
好吧，我们祝你一路平安，我们正在看联系窗口刚刚过去。
Okay, we'll wish you a safe journey and we're looking-- And the contact window's just passed.

863
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,421
好了，关上内门。
Okay, closing the inner door.

864
01:13:49,664 --> 01:13:51,365
嗯…那是什么?
Uh... What is that?

865
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,502
飞机没有反应。
The jets are not responding.

866
01:14:00,574 --> 01:14:01,609
哇……
Whoa...

867
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:09,016
那是什么?
What is that?

868
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:12,887
喷气坦克过热了，但是…我们甚至还没有点燃。
The jet tanks overheated but... We haven't even ignited.

869
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:18,125
过热?-温度一直在上升，但是…妈的，这不可能。
-Overheated? -The temperature keeps rising, but... fuck, that can't be right.

870
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:19,126
汉娜,什么?
Hannah, what?

871
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,561
我们有超压。
We have overpressure.

872
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:22,263
-哦,大便。吹嘘的毫无意义。
-Oh, shit. -Makes no sense.

873
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:24,098
我需要释放氧气罐。
I need to release the tanks.

874
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:29,036
-工作吗?-阀门打不开。
-Did it work? -The valves are not opening.

875
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:31,639
-试试煤气出口!我试过!
-Try the gas outlet! -I tried!

876
01:14:31,672 --> 01:14:34,342
它们一定是热得变形了!
They must have deformed under the heat!

877
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:36,210
水箱有多热?
How hot are the tanks?

878
01:14:38,045 --> 01:14:39,080
汉娜?
Hannah?

879
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:41,816
汉娜!
Hannah!

880
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:45,553
立即解开!现在出去!
Unfasten immediately! Get out now!

881
01:14:49,957 --> 01:14:52,827
——加油!-来吧，来吧来吧。
- Come on! - Come on, come on. Come on.

882
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,061
快点，我们要爆炸了!
Come on, we're gonna explode!

883
01:14:54,095 --> 01:14:56,130
把自己放在一起。
Put yourself together.

884
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:58,366
你振作起来了!来吧!
You put yourself together! Come on!

885
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:02,203
走吧!
Go!

886
01:15:07,742 --> 01:15:11,012
-他妈的?-什么?
-What the fuck? -What?

887
01:15:11,045 --> 01:15:16,183
看。灶神星的冷却系统在近11小时前关闭了。
Look. The Vesta's cooling system shut down almost 11 hours ago.

888
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:19,687
这就是水箱过热的原因。我会改变太阳能板的方向。
That's why the tanks overheated. I'll redirect the solar panels.

889
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,057
光靠影子已经不行了。看看温度。
Shadow alone won't do it anymore. Look at the temperature.

890
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,425
我们需要解耦它。
We need to decouple it.

891
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,427
不。不，肯定还有别的办法。
No. No, there has to be another way.

892
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,430
我们可以手动倒掉水箱，对吧?
We can dump the tanks manually, eh?

893
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:31,332
可以工作。
That could work.

894
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:34,035
只能从灶神星内部，但那太危险了。
Only from inside the Vesta, but that's far too dangerous.

895
01:15:34,702 --> 01:15:35,803
加文,停止!
Gavin, stop!

896
01:15:35,836 --> 01:15:37,538
它随时都可能爆炸!
It could blow up any second!

897
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:38,606
他妈的!
Fuck!

898
01:15:48,517 --> 01:15:51,585
他必须通过整个冷却装置。这是不可能的。
He has to go through the whole cooling block. That's impossible.

899
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:53,254
他是自杀。
He's killing himself.

900
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:54,355
我们所有的人。
All of us.

901
01:15:57,058 --> 01:15:58,426
还能解耦吗?
Can you still decouple?

902
01:16:07,368 --> 01:16:09,770
-不不不!不!——等等!汉娜!
- No, no, no! No! - Wait! Hannah!

903
01:16:09,804 --> 01:16:11,205
不!不!
No! No!

904
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:12,507
不!不!
No! No!

905
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:14,942
停!
Stop!

906
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,744
停!
Stop!

907
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,915
不!
No!

908
01:16:20,948 --> 01:16:22,149
不!
No!

909
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:23,284
汉娜,谢谢!
Hannah, please!

910
01:16:25,086 --> 01:16:26,287
不!
No!

911
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:41,896
我不得不。
I had to.

912
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:37,652
你做得对，指挥官。
You did the right thing, commander.

913
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:41,523
他会死的。
He would have died.

914
01:18:45,326 --> 01:18:52,466
我知道，在这里似乎不算什么…但是,呃…
I know, doesn't seem like much up here... But, uh...

915
01:18:54,636 --> 01:18:56,070
这个地方救了我们的命。
this place saved our lives.

916
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:02,243
可以回家。
Could be home.

917
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:11,819
你觉得怎么样?
How was it for you?

918
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:17,024
有一个孩子?
Having a child?

919
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:27,569
大声。
Loud.

920
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:32,406
伤脑筋。
Nerve-wracking.

921
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:34,743
让人筋疲力尽。
Exhausting.

922
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,245
很神奇的。
Amazing.

923
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:48,989
你无法想象你会像爱这个小东西一样爱别人。
You can't possibly imagine loving anyone like you love this little creature.

924
01:19:58,265 --> 01:19:59,300
好吧。
Okay.

925
01:20:30,532 --> 01:20:33,167
我们不需要两个人来告诉他们。
We don't need two people to tell them.

926
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,603
但我是……-走或者我走。
-But I was... -Go or I go.

927
01:20:44,546 --> 01:20:46,748
你这么做是因为怀孕吗?
Did you do it because of the pregnancy?

928
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:52,319
不。我这么做是因为我们。
No. I did it because of us.

929
01:20:55,255 --> 01:20:57,559
灶神星1 ?
Vesta 1?

930
01:20:57,592 --> 01:20:59,828
灶神一号，我们探测不到你的信号。
Vesta 1, we can't detect your signal.

931
01:21:01,362 --> 01:21:02,764
你读过吗?
Do you read?

932
01:21:02,797 --> 01:21:03,832
灶神星1 ?
Vesta 1?

933
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:07,134
是的，埃斯特，我们到了。
Yes, Esther we're here.

934
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,103
加文，你在哪里?发生了什么事?
Gavin, where are you? What happened?

935
01:21:30,157 --> 01:21:31,526
IKARUS是什么?
What's IKARUS?

936
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:36,163
他们说你会知道的。
They said that you would know.

937
01:21:48,877 --> 01:21:51,311
我的实际任务。
My actual mission.

938
01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:56,216
一旦我找到了一个工作母菌，我就会把整个藻类实验室都搞垮。
Once I found a working mother culture, I was to bring down the entire algae lab.

939
01:21:58,218 --> 01:22:00,822
它可以单独弹射和降落。
It can be ejected and flown down separately.

940
01:22:01,623 --> 01:22:05,125
-什么?-这是一次秘密军事行动。
-What? -It was a secret military operation.

941
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:07,127
我很惊讶这些ceo竟然知道这事。
I'm surprised these CEOs even know about it.

942
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:08,162
W-Wait。
W-Wait.

943
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:11,231
我们能继续下去吗?
C-Can we go down with it?

944
01:22:12,801 --> 01:22:16,103
它不是为乘客设计的，也不能被驾驶。
It's not made for passengers and can't be steered.

945
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:21,408
没有导航图标，我们只能在一个合理的时刻分离它，然后…往好处想吧。
Without Navicon we can only detach it at a calculated moment and... hope for the best.

946
01:22:22,209 --> 01:22:27,147
但从理论上讲，如果我们为乘客改装的话，我们可以登上飞机。
But theoretically, we could board it if we adapted it for passengers.

947
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:33,187
汉娜，搞什么鬼?你为什么不告诉我还有一次重返地球的机会?
Hannah, what the fuck? Why didn't you tell me that there was another chance for re-entry?

948
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,489
因为这不是一个严肃的选择。好吧?
Because it's not a serious option. Okay?

949
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:49,604
三个人对300人。
Three people against 300.

950
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:57,244
是的，如果其他碉堡成功了，可能会更多。
Yes, or even more if other bunkers made it.

951
01:23:04,819 --> 01:23:06,588
我觉得我们应该这么做。
I think we should do it.

952
01:23:06,621 --> 01:23:09,122
如果我们不尝试，那他们就完了。
If we don't try, then it's done for them down there.

953
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:10,792
我们不能让这种事发生。
We can't let that happen.

954
01:23:11,893 --> 01:23:13,962
这不是我们的事，对吧?
This is bigger than us, right?

955
01:23:17,866 --> 01:23:19,132
对吧?
Right?

956
01:24:40,582 --> 01:24:43,985
你，混蛋，把灶神星和冷却系统断开了。
You, asshole, disconnected the Vesta from the cooling cycle.

957
01:24:44,953 --> 01:24:46,688
我们差点因为你而死。
We almost died because of you.

958
01:24:49,222 --> 01:24:55,597
我不想，我只是，我只是想推迟。
I didn't want, I just-- I just wanted a delay.

959
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:57,197
这是个意外。
It was an accident.

960
01:24:59,801 --> 01:25:02,502
是啊，我不知道瓣膜可以关闭。
Yeah, I didn't know the valves can close up.

961
01:25:02,537 --> 01:25:05,105
我不能让发生在丹尼洛身上的事发生在我们身上。
I couldn't let what happened to Danilo happen to us.

962
01:25:05,138 --> 01:25:07,341
废话。
Bullshit.

963
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:10,812
你这么做只是因为你是个自私的懦夫。
You just did it because you're a selfish coward.

964
01:25:19,486 --> 01:25:21,154
你知道这是什么吗?
You know what this is?

965
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:24,058
是的。
Yeah.

966
01:25:24,092 --> 01:25:26,094
你知道它的作用吗?
And you know what it does?

967
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:29,162
我在某个时候发现的，是的。
I found out at some point, yes.

968
01:25:29,196 --> 01:25:32,800
很好。因为这就是我们现在要做的
Good. 'Cause that's what we'll do now.

969
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:36,537
我们会把共生文化带回这里，然后飞下去。
We will pump back the symbiosis cultures in here and we will fly down.

970
01:25:37,972 --> 01:25:41,943
这么说你一直都知道伊karus的存在?
So you knew about IKARUS all of this time?

971
01:25:41,976 --> 01:25:44,112
你什么都没说?
And you didn't say anything?

972
01:25:51,085 --> 01:25:52,920
你也不想这样。
You didn't want this either.

973
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:57,190
是吗?
Did you?

974
01:25:57,224 --> 01:25:58,425
加文是正确的。
Gavin is right.

975
01:25:59,259 --> 01:26:00,528
我们需要帮助。
We need to help.

976
01:26:02,362 --> 01:26:06,534
关心自己的生活没什么可耻的，汉娜。
There is no shame in caring for your own life, Hannah.

977
01:26:07,902 --> 01:26:09,369
特别是现在。
Especially now.

978
01:26:09,403 --> 01:26:10,538
阻止它。
Stop it.

979
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:21,649
你有没有问过自己为什么尼布拉突然这么需要海藻?
Have you ever asked yourself why Nibra needed the algae so bad all of a sudden?

980
01:26:21,683 --> 01:26:24,552
我是说，这么多年来他们根本不在乎。
I mean, for years they didn't give a fuck.

981
01:26:24,585 --> 01:26:26,954
现在他们突然什么都想要了。
Suddenly they want everything, now.

982
01:26:26,988 --> 01:26:28,523
他们现在就需要这个系统。
They need the system now.

983
01:26:28,556 --> 01:26:31,526
他们把你送到太空去拿，为什么?
They send you to space to get it, why?

984
01:26:31,559 --> 01:26:33,161
为什么,现在?
Why, now?

985
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:34,862
你想说什么?
What are you trying to say?

986
01:26:36,631 --> 01:26:37,799
他们知道。
They knew.

987
01:26:42,003 --> 01:26:45,238
他们知道一场灾难即将来临。
They knew a catastrophe was coming.

988
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:48,408
他们只是没有告诉任何人。
They just didn't tell anyone.

989
01:26:49,577 --> 01:26:51,079
他们为什么要这么做?
And why would they?

990
01:26:51,112 --> 01:26:53,614
他们不想和别人共用地堡。
They didn't want to share their bunkers.

991
01:26:56,784 --> 01:27:04,158
你真的认为，如果是反过来，他们会给你藻类吗?
Do you really think, they would give you their algae, if it was the other way around?

992
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,338
我们已经做出了决定。
We've made a decision.

993
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:21,943
按照你的要求，我们把藻类实验室派给你了。
We're sending the algae lab down to you, like you asked.

994
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:24,145
但我们会和它一起来。
But we're coming with it.

995
01:27:24,178 --> 01:27:27,915
好的，我们很期待。
Okay, we're looking forward to that.

996
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:30,618
等等，开始前还有一件事。
Wait, one more thing before we start.

997
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:33,253
我要和其中一个士兵谈谈。
I need to talk to one of the soldiers.

998
01:27:35,388 --> 01:27:38,593
但我是我们的代表。
But I am our representative.

999
01:27:38,626 --> 01:27:41,294
是的，但伊卡拉斯是军事任务，所以。
Yes, but IKARUS is a military mission, so.

1000
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:45,566
呃……好吧。
Eh... okay.

1001
01:27:47,969 --> 01:27:51,939
事情是这样的……这里没有士兵。
The thing is... there are no soldiers here.

1002
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:59,279
但你说士兵们带你进了掩体。
But you said the soldiers brought you into the bunkers.

1003
01:28:01,582 --> 01:28:06,087
是的，他们把我们带到这里，但是…我们空间有限。
Yes, they brought us here, but... we have limited space.

1004
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,923
我们可以容纳300名平民。
We have room for 300 civilians.

1005
01:28:10,258 --> 01:28:11,458
家庭。
Families.

1006
01:28:11,491 --> 01:28:15,362
那又怎样?你……你就把它们丢在外面了?
So what? You... You just left them outside?

1007
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:16,998
去死吗?
To die?

1008
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,568
他们履行了自己的职责。
They did their duty.

1009
01:28:22,236 --> 01:28:24,005
这是尼布拉的命令?
That was Nibra's order?

1010
01:28:24,038 --> 01:28:27,374
给所有撤离的士兵?
For all evacuation soldiers?

1011
01:28:27,407 --> 01:28:29,744
汉娜，你的工作就是让我们活着!
Hannah, it is your job to keep us alive!

1012
01:28:30,745 --> 01:28:32,847
你说谎了。
You lied.

1013
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,917
不，我们没有撒谎。
No, we didn't lie.

1014
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:40,353
你只是假设了你想相信的。
You just assumed what you wanted to believe.

1015
01:28:40,387 --> 01:28:42,957
抱歉，但你在想什么?
I'm sorry, but what were you thinking?

1016
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:50,798
我们只想活下去，仅此而已。
All we want is to live, nothing more.

1017
01:28:50,832 --> 01:28:53,466
我们希望我们的孩子能活下去。
We want our kids to survive.

1018
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,403
你不能因此责怪我们。
I mean, you can't blame us for that.

1019
01:29:03,945 --> 01:29:09,750
他妈的!啊!
Fuck! Ugh!

1020
01:29:29,237 --> 01:29:31,205
来吧，从地板上起来。
Come on, get off the floor.

1021
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:33,207
不,我完成了。
No, I'm done.

1022
01:29:33,241 --> 01:29:35,710
汉娜，他们几天内就会缺氧。
Hannah, they'll run out of oxygen within days.

1023
01:29:35,743 --> 01:29:39,013
是啊，为什么我这样的炮灰会在乎?
Yeah, and why would cannon fodder like me care?

1024
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:42,316
他们根本不在乎我。克诺夫出版社。
They didn't give a shit about me. Or Knopf.

1025
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:43,985
或者我的父母。
Or my parents.

1026
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:49,824
显然，金钱和特权也不能让你在地堡里有一席之地。
Apparently, money and privilege don't get you a spot in the bunker either.

1027
01:29:51,926 --> 01:29:54,695
你知道下面也有孩子，对吧?
You know that there are children down there too, right?

1028
01:29:55,863 --> 01:29:57,231
那么这个呢?
And what about this one?

1029
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,636
你说过我们不能在这里养。
You said that we couldn't raise it here.

1030
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:07,308
为什么不是呢?我的意思是……这地方比我以前住过的任何地方都好。
Why actually not? I mean... this place is better than anywhere I lived before.

1031
01:30:07,341 --> 01:30:09,310
变老吗?
Growing old here?

1032
01:30:09,343 --> 01:30:11,178
从来没有看到地球?
Never seeing Earth?

1033
01:30:11,212 --> 01:30:12,780
那是什么样的生活?
What kind of a life is that?

1034
01:30:14,181 --> 01:30:15,616
至少是一生。
At least a life.

1035
01:30:22,757 --> 01:30:24,457
我…我不明白。
I... I don't get it.

1036
01:30:24,491 --> 01:30:28,129
你只是受伤了还是真的想要这个孩子?
Are you just hurt or do you really want this baby?

1037
01:30:28,162 --> 01:30:31,332
我不知道，好吗?
See, I don't know, okay?

1038
01:30:31,365 --> 01:30:34,101
我从没想过要孩子。
I never thought about having a child.

1039
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:36,938
成家就意味着回到贫穷的生活。
Having a family meant going back to being poor.

1040
01:30:36,971 --> 01:30:38,873
不服从就意味着贫穷。
Not obeying meant being poor.

1041
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:40,908
一个士兵甚至没有这个选择。
A soldier doesn't even have that choice.

1042
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:46,347
这个选择比拯救我们的世界更重要。
And that choice is more important than saving the rest of our world.

1043
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,481
是的。
Yes.

1044
01:30:48,516 --> 01:30:51,419
你不会明白的，domer。
You wouldn't understand that, domer.

1045
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:55,056
对你这样的人来说，玩《拯救世界》很简单
For someone like you, it's easy playing "Save the World."

1046
01:30:55,089 --> 01:31:00,027
但不是每个人都有一个把他送到这里来避难的爸爸如果其他事情都泡汤了。
But not everyone has a daddy who sends him up here for safety if everything else goes down the drain.

1047
01:31:02,495 --> 01:31:04,165
你真的这么想吗?
Is that really what you think?

1048
01:31:08,235 --> 01:31:09,270
嗯。
Huh.

1049
01:32:15,069 --> 01:32:16,537
加文?
Gavin?

1050
01:32:41,896 --> 01:32:42,897
开门。
Open the door.

1051
01:32:47,802 --> 01:32:49,503
我要完成我们开始的事情。
I'm finishing what we started.

1052
01:32:50,539 --> 01:32:52,206
你要把我丢下吗?
Are you leaving me behind?

1053
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,642
不，但我得把它做完。
No, but I just need to finish up.

1054
01:32:54,675 --> 01:32:56,010
只是等待。
Just wait.

1055
01:32:56,043 --> 01:32:57,878
你怎么知道我不会阻止你?
How can you know I won't stop you?

1056
01:33:00,748 --> 01:33:03,617
因为你是个好人。
Because you're a good person.

1057
01:33:03,651 --> 01:33:05,352
你知道这是对的。
And you know that this is right.

1058
01:34:42,183 --> 01:34:44,084
汉娜,等等!停!
Hannah, wait! Stop!

1059
01:34:45,386 --> 01:34:46,387
加文,阻止它!
Gavin, stop it!

1060
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:47,388
请动!
Please, move!

1061
01:34:47,421 --> 01:34:51,959
不!加文!加文!加文!
No! Gavin! Gavin! Gavin!

1062
01:34:53,628 --> 01:34:56,931
不,住手!
Don't-- Stop it!

1063
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:58,332
我不能让你这么做。
I can't let you do this.

1064
01:35:19,621 --> 01:35:27,394
汉娜，我们能谈谈吗?我——我不能。我只是不想。
Hannah, can-- can we talk about this? I-- I can't. I just don't want to.

1065
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:30,965
汉娜,请…
Hannah, please just...

1066
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:41,576
他妈的!
Fuck!

1067
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:57,258
汉娜，你能搞定的，对吧?
Hannah, You can fix this, right?

1068
01:35:58,292 --> 01:35:59,426
汉娜?
Hannah?

1069
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:03,665
我很抱歉……我想留下来。
I'm sorry... I wanna stay.

1070
01:38:40,555 --> 01:38:41,823
加文?
Gavin?

1071
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:49,864
加文?
Gavin?

1072
01:41:37,999 --> 01:41:39,033
来吧。
Come on.

1073
01:41:40,467 --> 01:41:42,770
让我们看看是否能以某种方式修复IKARUS。
Let's see if we can fix IKARUS somehow.

1074
01:41:43,805 --> 01:41:45,673
是的,什么?
Yeah, what?

1075
01:41:47,075 --> 01:41:48,108
为什么?
Why?

1076
01:41:50,545 --> 01:41:54,181
我们需要三个人呼吸否则气体混合物就会坍缩。
We need three breathers or the gas mix collapses.

1077
01:41:54,214 --> 01:41:55,248
你的言语。
Your words.

1078
01:42:01,623 --> 01:42:07,829
你……你认为是加文干的…是的。
You... You think Gavin did it... Yeah.

1079
01:42:07,862 --> 01:42:09,530
他把自己的意志强加给我们。
He forced his will on us.

1080
01:42:11,032 --> 01:42:12,299
他得到了他想要的。
He got what he wanted.

1081
01:42:20,642 --> 01:42:24,078
-什么?-不…不,不,不……
-What? -No... No, no, no...

1082
01:42:27,115 --> 01:42:29,249
我们需要三个呼吸器，对吧?
We need three breathers, right?

1083
01:42:38,126 --> 01:42:41,261
迪米特里?
Dimitri?

1084
01:42:41,294 --> 01:42:46,868
我是在他试图…我只是，我只是不想让他伤害自己。
I said it after he tried to... I just-- I just didn't want him to harm himself.

1085
01:42:51,673 --> 01:42:53,541
我想救他。

1086
01:42:57,917 --> 01:43:00,875
你这个白痴，你做了什么?

-我明白了。我做的事。-不不不!
- I got you. I do. - No, no, no!

1100
01:44:58,699 --> 01:45:00,467
伙计们，这东西起作用了。
Look, guys, the thing is working.

1101
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,103
给我!喂?
Give it to me! Hello?

1102
01:45:02,136 --> 01:45:04,839
你在里面吗?在盒子里吗?
Are you in there? In the box?

1103
01:45:04,872 --> 01:45:08,341
不，我们在南部营地。
No, we are in the southern camps.

1104
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:10,511
——你呢?你叫什么名字?克诺夫
-And you? What's your name? -Knopf.

你还能在外面玩吗?

1108

不行，妈妈说我们在外面不能呼吸。

嘿,嘘。那就问问她你能不能过来
Hey, shh.  Well, then ask her if you can come down here.

1111

大人们总是在寻找幸存者。
The grown-ups are always searching for survivors anyway.

Stop it! Seriously, can't you come?
