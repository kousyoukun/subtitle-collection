1
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:13,267 
<i>This is a.44 Magnum,</i>
<i>the most powerful handgun in the world.</i>

2
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:16,144 
<i>And it could blow your head clean off.</i>

3
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,484 
<i>Do you feel lucky?</i>

4
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:27,537 
Mr. Ricca!
How do you feel about your acquittal?

5
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:30,913 
It proves what I always said,
I had nothing to do with Scarza's murder.

6
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,406 
Who could have killed
Anthony Scarza and his family?

7
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,938 
That's a stupid question. Get off my back!

8
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:40,311 
Mr. Weinstein, explain the technicality
involving the lack of admissible evidence.

9
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:43,304 
That's a legality
that can't be explained at this time.

10
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:46,142 
Mr. Weinstein, you don't seem surprised
about the decision.

11
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:48,674 
I don't know why they waste
the taxpayers' money.

12
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,549 
This whole thing is an arbitrary attack
on a legitimate businessman.

13
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:54,812 
- Do you have any comments?
- What, dear?

14
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,577 
Do you have any other comments?

15
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,955 
I'll give you a comment:
Their minds are dead.

16
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:01,410 
- What do you mean by that?
- Their minds are dead.

17
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:03,942 
Mr. Ricca means he is very pleased
with the decision.

18
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,052 
There's a big crowd.
Do you fear for your life?

19
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,740 
No, of course not.

20
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,231 
Mr. Estabrook.

21
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:14,108 
As the prosecutor,
how do you feel about the court's decision?

22
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,371 
It's happened before,
it'll probably happen again.

23
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:17,829 
I have no more comments.

24
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:23,468 
I'm sorry, no comments. No comments!

25
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:24,964 
I have no comments.

26
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,574 
You know what I think?
I'll tell you what I think!

27
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,531 
Fuck the courts, that's what I think!

28
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:47,367 
They've already wasted too much time
worrying about the rights of killers!

29
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:48,748 
Ricca, you're a killer!

30
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,139 
Get in the car! Go on!

31
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:27,838 
Murderer!

32
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:49,742 
<i>Today the noted labor leader</i>
<i>Carmine Ricca...</i>

33
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,118 
<i>... was acquitted on a technicality:</i>
<i>The lack of admissible evidence.</i>

34
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,842 
Ricca had been charged with complicity...

35
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,524 
...in the murders of labor reformer
Anthony Scarza and his family.

36
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:03,245 
When he appeared outside
the courthouse this afternoon, a free man...

37
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,046 
<i>... it touched off a wild,</i>
<i>mob-like demonstration.</i>

38
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,230 
<i>But the police were finally able</i>
<i>to bring it under control...</i>

39
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,685 
<i>... and there have been</i>
<i>no reports of injuries.</i>

40
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:15,521 
<i>But one can expect an uproar</i>
<i>from an angry and alarmed crowd...</i>

41
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,206 
<i>... which fully expected Ricca</i>
<i>to be convicted.</i>

42
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,735 
<i>And I'm sure we haven't heard</i>
<i>the last of the Ricca case.</i>

43
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,651 
<i>Art Brown reporting from city hall.</i>

44
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,100 
Cop.

45
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,093 
Gino, for Christ's sake.

46
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,890 
Come on, Carmine.
I'm driving this thing like a baby carriage.

47
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,941 
Could I see your driver's license, please?

48
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,859 
Do you know who that is
sitting back there?

49
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:33,736 
I'll still have to see
your driver's license, please.

50
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,578 
I'll have to find it.

51
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,803 
Do you know why you're being stopped?

52
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:42,483 
Yes, we know, Officer,
and you're making a big mistake.

53
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,552 
- You crossed a double line back there.
- A double line?

54
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:46,971 
Take it easy.

55
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:49,426 
Whatever you say, Officer.

56
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:53,799 
I just happened to find it, sir.

57
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,428 
That's right, Simple Simon.

58
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,152 
Check, see if it's stolen.

59
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,144 
I want this bastard busted out of his job.

60
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,558 
We'll take care of this guy.
You fellas, just take it easy.

61
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,979 
- This car registered to you?
- To him.

62
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:32,352 
- I'll have to see the registration.
- Come on, give me that license.

63
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:11,941 
That's okay.

64
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,626 
Hi, Harry. Is this your case?

65
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,035 
Walter?

66
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:39,868 
Hello, Harry. What are you doing here?

67
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:42,860 
This couldn't have happened
to a nicer bunch.

68
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:46,083 
Ricca, Weinstein, his attorney.
James Cantina, the driver.

69
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:48,192 
What about the bodyguard?

70
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:50,532 
We're checking that out now, Lieutenant.

71
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:54,138 
Looks like somebody saved
the taxpayers a lot of money, doesn't it?

72
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:58,013 
Callahan, what're you doing here?
You're on loan to stakeout.

73
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,197 
We had nothing hot on,
besides, we were close.

74
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:05,685 
Callahan, you get your lying ass in gear
and get back to that stake-out squad.

75
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:07,718 
Anything else, you call it in.

76
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:16,158 
- Who do you think did this, Briggs?
- You're on loan to stakeout, Callahan.

77
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:18,613 
That's right, Lieutenant, you saw to that.

78
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:21,682 
I've got nothing personal
against you, Callahan.

79
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,096 
But we can't have the public crying,
"police brutality"...

80
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:27,091 
...every time you're on the street.

81
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,507 
You just might need me on a job like this.

82
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,617 
Whoever did this was very good at it.

83
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:33,727 
You'd sure be the one to know, Harry.

84
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,528 
- Well, I just work for this city, Briggs.
- So do I.

85
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,714 
Longer than you.

86
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:43,394 
And I never had to take my gun out
of its holster, once. I'm proud of that.

87
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,732 
Well, you're a good man, Lieutenant.

88
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,532 
A good man always knows his limitations.

89
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:54,979 
- Lt. Briggs?
- Yeah?

90
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:57,971 
What did you get?

91
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,618 
Well, it looks like
they were killed with a Magnum.

92
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:04,263 
The boys now are checking
the blood types and for fingerprints.

93
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,406 
What do you have?

94
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,817 
Driver's license. Doesn't look at all
like the usual gangster crap, does it?

95
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:16,270 
Briggs has his nose up his ass today.

96
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:20,067 
I guess he thinks
that's where his promotion is.

97
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,062 
See you later, Harry.

98
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,515 
What's with you and Briggs anyway?

99
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:27,126 
Jealousy.

100
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:31,231 
He knows this is the kind of case
I should be on. It's just a matter of time.

101
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,993 
Hey, Early, want to get in on this?

102
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,100 
What the hell is that about?

103
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:40,476 
They're giving odds on how long
you'll stay alive being my partner.

104
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:41,742 
Are you kidding?

105
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,007 
Nope.

106
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:44,849 
How long did your last partner go?

107
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,038 
A couple of weeks.

108
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:49,145 
Don't worry, he's still alive,
teaching college.

109
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:51,754 
You have another trade, Smith?

110
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:53,288 
No, no. Do you?

111
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:55,130 
No, but Bill Mackenzie does.

112
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,240 
Who in the hell is Bill Mackenzie?

113
00:11:57,355 --> 00:12:00,385 
He's an ex-homicide man,
has a snack shop out at the airport.

114
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:02,457 
Greatest burgers in town. Hungry?

115
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:06,254 
- How can you be hungry after seeing that?
- Seeing what?

116
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:26,010 
So, Ricca finally bought it.
There must be hope for the world yet.

117
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,466 
How about you? Do you want something?

118
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:32,263 
- We got chili and garlic bread today.
- No, thank you. I don't feel very hungry.

119
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,869 
In broad daylight at close range?
Must've looked like ripe melons.

120
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:40,971 
<i>Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,</i>
<i>use white courtesy telephone.</i>

121
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:42,467 
Now all keep calm.

122
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:47,646 
I'll never forget the Floyd case.

123
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,756 
Got it with an axe during the rush hour.

124
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,019 
How about some cream pie?

125
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:55,395 
<i>Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,</i>
<i>use white courtesy telephone.</i>

126
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:58,579 
Must be trouble.
That's the airport code name for trouble.

127
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,111 
We've got 90 people being terrorized
by those maniacs...

128
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,914 
...in boarding area B right now.

129
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:49,868 
What's taking so long?
They said they'd be there in 15 minutes?

130
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,364 
Where's that overseas pilot?

131
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:54,049 
I don't understand.
How did they get through security?

132
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,083 
- I don't know.
- Any problems here?

133
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,579 
What are you doing here?

134
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:00,341 
- I'm sorry, you'll have to leave.
- I'm a police officer.

135
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:03,601 
We've got two frantic hijackers
on our New York flight.

136
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:07,706 
- Have you called the FBI?
- They're on their way here right now.

137
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:10,660 
But the hijackers want an overseas pilot
before they take off.

138
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,532 
May I make a suggestion?

139
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:48,983 
Good afternoon.

140
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:51,975 
You took your goddamn time about it.
Now, close that door!

141
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,085 
All right, what's in there?

142
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:57,345 
Overseas charts and flight plans.

143
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:58,496 
Set it down!

144
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,872 
All right, turn around.

145
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:08,585 
Stay there.

146
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,710 
All right, turn around here.

147
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,472 
Here! Now get in there!

148
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:28,840 
- It's all yours now.
- All right get this thing up!

149
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,906 
Where to?

150
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,320 
You get us up,
I'll tell you where to when we're up.

151
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:43,724 
You want to put us in take-off position?

152
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,708 
Starting three.

153
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:43,836 
Move it!

154
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:47,135 
All right, I'll take it.

155
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,819 
That's right, Lieutenant. We were lucky
to have one of your men here.

156
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:22,274 
He's on board now, an Inspector Callahan.

157
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:24,000 
Callahan!

158
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:43,680 
Excuse me, Captain.
I know this may sound silly...

159
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,291 
...but can you fly?

160
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:48,551 
No. Never had a lesson.

161
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:16,862 
Sit down!

162
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:01,438 
What are you doing here, Lieutenant?

163
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:37,382 
Harry! You crazy son of a bitch!
I could've killed you.

164
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:40,489 
Yeah, I noticed that, Charlie.
What the hell you doing?

165
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,484 
I haven't seen you in a coon's age.

166
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:46,013 
I been meaning to drop by,
but we've been kind of busy.

167
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,581 
Yeah, well,
I ain't living with Carol anymore.

168
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,691 
Sorry to hear that.

169
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:55,642 
Yeah. It's my third time at bat.

170
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:58,673 
Where's the time go?

171
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:01,320 
I'm afraid of time.

172
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,961 
I know you 10 years already, ever since
I first came out here, you realize that?

173
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:09,069 
You don't look older to me.
Do I look older to you?

174
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,823 
Why don't you put in
for some desk work, Charlie?

175
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,702 
You don't need the streets anymore.

176
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,889 
We should've put our 20 in the Marines.

177
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:22,917 
These days,
a cop kills a hoodlum on the street...

178
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:25,487 
...he might as well just dump
the body some place.

179
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:27,827 
Because those snot-nosed
young bastards...

180
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:31,318 
...down at the DA's office will crucify them
one way or another.

181
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:34,234 
A hood can kill a cop,
but let a cop kill a hood...

182
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:35,998 
Am I right?

183
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,637 
You put in plenty of time,
why don't you go for retirement?

184
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:44,016 
What the hell, you don't need this.

185
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:48,274 
I know you 10 years.
I'll tell you something, I'll never retire.

186
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:49,578 
Never!

187
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,954 
I'm going out fighting.

188
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:55,869 
That's the only way to go. Am I right?

189
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:48,616 
You boys rookies?

190
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:50,649 
Yes, sir. Traffic.

191
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:53,181 
I'm John Davis. This is Phil Sweet.

192
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,557 
That's Red Astrachan, Mike Grimes.

193
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,549 
- You're Inspector Harry Callahan, no?
- That's right.

194
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:02,541 
What are you doing here?
Don't you have regular times for this?

195
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:05,380 
You shouldn't be on the streets
if you can't shoot well.

196
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,717 
- Killers don't make allowances.
- You're in big trouble.

197
00:22:08,986 --> 00:22:10,213 
Can't fault you there.

198
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,860 
Are you shooting
in the combat championship next week?

199
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:13,819 
I always do.

200
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:17,348 
- You win every year, don't you?
- Became sort of an institution around here.

201
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,535 
Yes, sir, we've heard all about you.

202
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:24,675 
This is about the only time
I get this place alone.

203
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:27,591 
We'll leave if you'd like
the range to yourself.

204
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:32,616 
No, that's all right.

205
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:37,143 
What kind of a load do you use in that.44?

206
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,562 
A light special.

207
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:41,363 
This size gun gives me better control
and less recoil...

208
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,933 
...than a.357 Magnum with wadcutters.

209
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,008 
That's not bad.

210
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,885 
Care to try?

211
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,573 
No, sir. No, I don't think so.

212
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,220 
- Come on, give it a try.
- Go on, Sweet.

213
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:25,977 
I'm farsighted.

214
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:32,114 
Don't drop it.

215
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:52,331 
Hey, that's not bad.

216
00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:55,822 
Well, I think it's just a little heavy for me.
I missed one.

217
00:23:55,937 --> 00:23:57,241 
You'll get used to it.

218
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,773 
Where did you learn to shoot?
Not around here.

219
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,573 
No, sir, no.
Airborne Rangers, Special Forces.

220
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:06,486 
And the rest of these guys, even close?

221
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:08,941 
Well, Grimes here, he's...

222
00:24:09,478 --> 00:24:11,358 
...I guess he's about even with me.

223
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:14,312 
Astrachan's a little better on a good day.

224
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:17,342 
And Davis is just dog nuts.
He's a lot better.

225
00:24:18,455 --> 00:24:23,288 
A lot better? Sure show a sense of style.
Sweet, is it?

226
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:24,439 
Yes, sir.

227
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:27,700 
When I get back on Homicide,
I hope you boys will come see me.

228
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:29,656 
- Good.
- Thank you very much, we'd like that.

229
00:24:29,695 --> 00:24:31,267 
Let's go!

230
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,147 
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

231
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:36,638 
Who buys? The sun was in my eyes!

232
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:39,784 
- You got to be on, Grimes.
- The sun is always in your eyes.

233
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:43,466 
How come I always have to buy
the beer for you turkeys.

234
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:47,034 
Where do you want to go?

235
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,448 
Put your hat on!

236
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:36,175 
Come on now, baby.

237
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,450 
Will you look at my ring!

238
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:12,541 
It's beautiful!

239
00:27:30,338 --> 00:27:31,642 
Is this a gang war?

240
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,291 
You have nothing to say?

241
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,127 
- Do you expect more murder or violence?
- I have nothing to say at this time.

242
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,698 
- Is this a gang war, Lieutenant?
- No comment.

243
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:43,994 
There were 200 murders last year.
Do you want to make a comment on that?

244
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:49,978 
There'll be no bombs in pools.
This town belongs to the people.

245
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,165 
We're gonna have law and order here.

246
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:54,850 
<i>That's all I have to say at this time.</i>

247
00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:57,037 
<i>What does that mean, Lieutenant?</i>

248
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:08,929 
You're it!

249
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,990 
You're it!

250
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,097 
Don't you want to play with us?

251
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:21,204 
- Well, I don't know, sweetheart.
- Just a little while?

252
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,468 
You're really getting the full treatment.

253
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:25,885 
It's not often you get a sit-down dinner.

254
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:30,833 
Okay, kids. All right, that's enough.

255
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:35,130 
- Just a little bit more, just five minutes?
- Let's go, let's go.

256
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:37,431 
Say good night to Harry and off to bed.

257
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,464 
- Good night.
- Good night, my love.

258
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:42,725 
- Good night.
- Take it easy.

259
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:44,988 
- 'Bye.
- Good night, Harry.

260
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:51,855 
Take the jacket out of your mouth,
sweetheart.

261
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:03,095 
Boy, sometimes they're too much for me.

262
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:07,238 
But then I can't afford
a woman coming in anymore.

263
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:10,077 
I think you manage quite well.

264
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:12,110 
Well, I just laugh all day long.

265
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,255 
I'm glad you called.

266
00:29:17,404 --> 00:29:19,935 
Tell me, have you seen Charlie?

267
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:23,503 
Yes, I saw him last night.

268
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,961 
Wanted to see the kids...

269
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,567 
...and then he started playing
a little Russian roulette with his revolver.

270
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:30,753 
What happened?

271
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,666 
What could I do? I went next door,
we finally got him to stop.

272
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,392 
What do you tell your children...

273
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:39,538 
...when they ask why their father
tried to shoot himself?

274
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,993 
What did you tell them?

275
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:46,251 
I just said it was a special kind of sickness
that some people have...

276
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:50,356 
...and that there are doctors
who could cure it... as if they could.

277
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,727 
Do you know where he's living right now?

278
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:59,217 
I don't know and I don't care anymore.

279
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:05,202 
He's so sick.
He shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun.

280
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,641 
Do you know that he was living
in North Beach with some nude dancer?

281
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:22,464 
Oh, well, I'm glad I'm over that one.

282
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:25,917 
I do have to survive.

283
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:27,375 
You will.

284
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,239 
You know, Harry, if I ask you
a personal question, would you mind?

285
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,425 
Sure, go ahead.

286
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:42,566 
Are you sure?
Because, well, it's a little difficult.

287
00:30:44,215 --> 00:30:47,131 
Look, we've been friends a long time,
go ahead and ask.

288
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:54,649 
Well, I'm just wondering
why you've never made a pass at me.

289
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:01,593 
Why?

290
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:06,848 
Goddamn it.

291
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:12,295 
With all those kids
do you think I'll ever get laid?

292
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:22,653 
Hello?

293
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,451 
Yes, just a moment.

294
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,599 
It's for you.

295
00:31:29,405 --> 00:31:30,977 
What's happening?

296
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:32,090 
Yeah?

297
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:34,737 
Yeah, Early, I saw it on TV.

298
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:39,302 
I'll be right down.
I'll come in the back way.

299
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:44,903 
- That's it, right?
- I have to go.

300
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,051 
Goodnight, Harry.

301
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,427 
Goodnight, sweetheart.

302
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:51,536 
How's it going?

303
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:53,224 
By the magazine rack.

304
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:57,213 
The owner remembers seeing him
just before the last robbery.

305
00:32:57,866 --> 00:33:00,743 
Yeah, he doesn't look much
like a paying customer, does he?

306
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:05,461 
- There's a car parked out in front.
- That's right, a no parking zone.

307
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:08,108 
Get over there by the door
with that shotgun.

308
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:09,029 
Okay.

309
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:16,010 
You think it'll be a hit or a miss?

310
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,433 
Well, here's three salty looking dudes.

311
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:14,818 
Freeze, nigger!

312
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,923 
- What you got there?
- Don't you go setting off no alarm.

313
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:20,918 
You! Get over here, fast!

314
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:24,140 
- You got a safe, nigger?
- No.

315
00:34:24,754 --> 00:34:26,288 
You lying sack of shit.

316
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:33,692 
All right, take it easy. Take it easy now.

317
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:35,226 
Suck it!

318
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:37,873 
Suck it!

319
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:41,249 
I'll kill you. I said, suck it.

320
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:45,277 
You go find that safe.

321
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:50,686 
Right here is where I kill me a nigger.

322
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,333 
Get on your knees.

323
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,402 
Get on your knees.

324
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,002 
Better get out there now.

325
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,115 
Not yet.

326
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:05,992 
Get on your knees.

327
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:28,663 
Police!

328
00:35:28,932 --> 00:35:29,661 
Drop it!

329
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:35,607 
All right, hold it!

330
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:25,093 
I never shot a man.

331
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,425 
Why don't you help the lady?

332
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:34,645 
It's all right, ma'am.

333
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,498 
You handled yourself real well tonight.

334
00:37:01,574 --> 00:37:04,106 
You work close. Man, you work close.

335
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,011 
Hey, where are you guys off to?

336
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:14,540 
- The Downtown Bowl on Eddy Street.
- Oh, yeah. See you later.

337
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:18,031 
- You know them?
- They came from the academy after me.

338
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,911 
They stick together like fly paper.

339
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,673 
Everybody thought
they were queer for each other.

340
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:26,164 
I'll tell you something,
if the rest of you could shoot like them...

341
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,309 
...I wouldn't care
if the whole damn department was queer.

342
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,682 
Excuse me, it's very important.

343
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,902 
What do you think you're doing?

344
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:06,251 
1000 O'Farrell.

345
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,071 
We're not going to get there
unless you keep your eyes on the road.

346
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:34,255 
Right on. 1000 O'Farrell.

347
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:13,460 
Too bad you're not on welfare.

348
00:39:14,573 --> 00:39:16,107 
I'd give you a freebie.

349
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:23,089 
Drive.

350
00:39:30,377 --> 00:39:33,561 
- Sidney, I was just on my way to see you.
- Where to?

351
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:36,669 
- Just keep on going until I tell you to stop.
- Yes, sir.

352
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,126 
Drop that flag.

353
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:42,922 
- You're on your way to see me?
- Yes, Sidney, honest.

354
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:45,031 
How come you didn't come by the crib?

355
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:46,643 
- Well...
- Don't shit me.

356
00:39:46,911 --> 00:39:48,062 
I wouldn't do that.

357
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:51,668 
- I've been waiting for you for one week.
- I've been working the convention.

358
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:54,929 
- No telephones in that hotel?
- I've been working like hell, you know?

359
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,573 
Let me show you.

360
00:40:01,488 --> 00:40:04,212 
- See? It's all here, all I got.
- AII?

361
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:07,204 
Looks like you've been holding out on me.

362
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:10,810 
No, I haven't. I've been straight
with you, Sidney. You know me.

363
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,800 
Damn right I know you. Let's see
how much there is in the titty bank.

364
00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:18,559 
Hello, Mr. Green.

365
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:23,009 
Check out the snatch bank, too.

366
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,727 
Damn right I know you.

367
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:30,873 
I was gonna give it all to you,
but you didn't give me a chance.

368
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,405 
Bitch, you had your chance.
I was your last chance.

369
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:35,745 
Everybody else in town
threw your black ass out.

370
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:37,816 
Help me!

371
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,308 
Good day, sir.
Is this car registered to you?

372
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,418 
Yes, sir. This is my car.

373
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:58,024 
You must be new. You know who I am?

374
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:01,208 
I'll still have to see your license
and registration, sir.

375
00:44:01,284 --> 00:44:04,123 
I believe you were speeding
coming across the bridge.

376
00:45:01,895 --> 00:45:02,701 
Hi.

377
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:05,002 
Hi.

378
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:07,112 
What's your name?

379
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:08,301 
Sunny.

380
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:13,787 
I've been living here for six months now.
It's funny I've never met you before.

381
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,511 
Well, I work a lot.

382
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:17,892 
I know.

383
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,960 
- You're the cop who lives upstairs.
- That's right.

384
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:23,032 
Mind if I ask you a question?

385
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:24,720 
No, go ahead.

386
00:45:25,525 --> 00:45:27,904 
What does a girl have to do
to go to bed with you?

387
00:45:34,003 --> 00:45:35,806 
Try knocking on the door.

388
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:56,173 
- Hi.
- Hi.

389
00:46:58,014 --> 00:46:59,817 
Do you always live in the dark?

390
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:03,769 
Well, you meet a better class of people
in the dark sometimes. Come on in.

391
00:47:08,717 --> 00:47:09,715 
Sit down.

392
00:47:18,844 --> 00:47:22,028 
Harry, this is Briggs. Are you alone?

393
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:24,714 
No, actually,
I'm entertaining a young lady friend.

394
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:28,857 
Put your pants back on, Callahan,
and come to the city morgue right away.

395
00:47:29,394 --> 00:47:31,427 
The morgue? What the hell for, Briggs?

396
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:34,457 
I'm not on homicide anymore.
I'm a stake-out man now, remember?

397
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:36,030 
Not anymore, Callahan.

398
00:47:36,107 --> 00:47:38,255 
You and your partner
are back on homicide.

399
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:41,669 
This is a little dramatic, isn't it, Briggs?
Not your usual style.

400
00:47:41,746 --> 00:47:43,204 
It's meant to be, Callahan.

401
00:47:43,434 --> 00:47:46,503 
This thing might be bigger
than even we think it is.

402
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:49,610 
Hijacking and gambling.

403
00:47:52,257 --> 00:47:53,254 
Trucking.

404
00:47:56,976 --> 00:47:58,740 
Narcotics and prostitution.

405
00:47:58,817 --> 00:48:00,351 
This is the cream in the bottle.

406
00:48:00,428 --> 00:48:02,538 
Someone wants
to put the courts out of business.

407
00:48:02,615 --> 00:48:04,763 
So far, you've said nothing wrong.

408
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,758 
This one just came in an hour ago.

409
00:48:07,026 --> 00:48:09,865 
Somebody wants it all.
This guy was just a pimp.

410
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:11,745 
That's one of his girls.

411
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:13,471 
How did she get it?

412
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:17,729 
Sometime before he got hit, he poured
a can of drain cleaner down her throat.

413
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,220 
That shows a certain sense of style.

414
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,637 
You're all heart, Callahan.

415
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:26,207 
Am I gonna have to have him
leaning over my shoulder?

416
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:28,547 
You work with Briggs on this, Callahan.

417
00:48:28,854 --> 00:48:32,882 
But if you ever lean out of line, so help me,
I'll flop you lower than whale shit.

418
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,682 
Speaking of whale shit,
what have you turned up, Briggs?

419
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:38,022 
Nobody in my department
is sitting on their ass.

420
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,017 
See this thing, Callahan? The chief.

421
00:48:40,094 --> 00:48:42,625 
He calls me on this all the time.
Even in the can.

422
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:44,697 
I haven't been out of my shoes
in 48 hours...

423
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:47,229 
...and still we have no witnesses, not one.

424
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:50,374 
In these cases, there's always
an officer right on top of the crime.

425
00:48:50,451 --> 00:48:52,216 
But nobody's ever seen a thing.

426
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:56,320 
- Who was the officer on this one?
- A patrolman, Sweet.

427
00:48:56,397 --> 00:48:57,663 
Wasn't it, Briggs?

428
00:48:57,931 --> 00:48:59,658 
Sweet seems like a good man.

429
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,803 
I'll get on the ballistic reports
first thing in the morning.

430
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,064 
We ran all the slugs through ballistics.
We'll never see those guns.

431
00:49:06,141 --> 00:49:08,673 
It was too professional,
you're wasting your time.

432
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:10,859 
Well, it takes me time, Briggs.

433
00:49:13,506 --> 00:49:15,654 
A man has to know his limitations.

434
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,936 
Warm enough?

435
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:02,839 
You're my first cop.

436
00:50:06,828 --> 00:50:09,360 
Guess that'll be two firsts tonight,
won't it?

437
00:50:45,957 --> 00:50:47,491 
What do the others look like?

438
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:49,869 
The gun was a.357 Magnum.

439
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:53,053 
The other bullets are all too deformed
to do us any good.

440
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:57,158 
Hollow points, fired point-blank, you know.
We were lucky to get these two.

441
00:50:57,772 --> 00:50:59,997 
I found them in the pimp's car.

442
00:51:00,419 --> 00:51:02,068 
.357 Magnum?

443
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,979 
Maybe it's a cop. Maybe it's Harry.

444
00:51:07,554 --> 00:51:09,856 
Nobody hates hoodlums
as much as he does.

445
00:51:13,347 --> 00:51:15,111 
Whoever it is, he enjoys it.

446
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,988 
It's possible the man was dead
with the first shot.

447
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:20,328 
The others were thrown in
just for good measure.

448
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:23,666 
- He unloaded a whole magazine into him.
- One big mothering hole, huh?

449
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:28,729 
Well, everybody has to pay something.

450
00:51:30,341 --> 00:51:33,525 
He would have to be standing right here,
this close...

451
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:35,404 
...point-blank range.

452
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:41,926 
The driver's license
and the $100 bill were out.

453
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,649 
Almost like he was showing it
to a traffic cop.

454
00:51:44,764 --> 00:51:45,762 
Yeah.

455
00:51:46,452 --> 00:51:50,787 
From what we have, it figures somebody
to be impersonating a police officer.

456
00:51:51,017 --> 00:51:53,626 
On the cars, at least.
It's been done before.

457
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:58,498 
This close, it would have to be
somebody he would never recognize.

458
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,723 
Or never suspect.

459
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:08,165 
Lou Guzman, ex-meat lugger
with a first-grade education.

460
00:52:09,354 --> 00:52:12,500 
He started working for the old boss
of bosses as a hitter.

461
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:17,065 
He controls narcotics state-wide,
and now dabbles in prostitution...

462
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,131 
...has big friends everywhere.
I want Casale and DiGiorgio on him.

463
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,742 
Next. Thank you.

464
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:27,038 
This one is for your special talents,
Callahan.

465
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:29,378 
Frank Palancio.

466
00:52:30,337 --> 00:52:32,217 
Two hundred and twelve pounds.

467
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:36,514 
Indicted for murder 23 times,
no convictions.

468
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:39,506 
Complains about his health now.

469
00:52:39,966 --> 00:52:43,687 
Suffers from ulcers, migraine headaches.
Dangerously violent.

470
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,523 
At one point,
he was Ricca's principle assassin.

471
00:52:47,562 --> 00:52:49,940 
If you mix it with him, he won't back off.

472
00:52:50,592 --> 00:52:52,050 
He's all yours, Callahan.

473
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,658 
That's very nice, Lieutenant,
but I don't think Palancio...

474
00:52:54,735 --> 00:52:56,500 
I want you on him, Callahan.

475
00:52:56,615 --> 00:53:00,106 
I'd bust Palancio for stepping
on a crack on the sidewalk if I could...

476
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:03,712 
...but this isn't his style.
Not the cars anyway, it's too direct.

477
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,203 
Callahan, you just keep your nose
pressed against Palancio's ass...

478
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:10,540 
...until I get a warrant
from the DA's office to bring him in.

479
00:53:10,617 --> 00:53:12,880 
And I want the first conviction
on this animal.

480
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:15,757 
Conviction?
He's liable to be your next victim.

481
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,097 
What are you asking for, Lieutenant?

482
00:53:18,174 --> 00:53:23,238 
I'm not asking you to follow him, Inspector.
For the last goddamn time, I'm telling you.

483
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:24,427 
Next.

484
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:29,606 
Nick Royale, Palancio's No. 1 hitter.

485
00:53:30,603 --> 00:53:32,137 
He's had good training.

486
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:56,804 
What's happening?

487
00:53:56,919 --> 00:54:00,026 
Nothing, just a lot of peeping and checking,
checking and peeping.

488
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:03,172 
I knew an old boy once
who used to keep pigs under his bed.

489
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,975 
Pigs? The eating kind?

490
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:08,274 
The eating kind.
Is all you ever think of your stomach?

491
00:54:14,603 --> 00:54:17,250 
That's very interesting.
I think we better get going.

492
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:18,132 
Yeah.

493
00:55:37,195 --> 00:55:40,801 
- They're splitting up. Which one, Harry?
- We'll stay with these two.

494
00:55:42,412 --> 00:55:45,059 
Across the bridge,
it's out of our jurisdiction.

495
00:55:45,097 --> 00:55:46,402 
Yeah.

496
00:55:50,468 --> 00:55:51,389 
Well?

497
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:53,652 
Stick with the money.

498
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:16,630 
Pull over and stop.

499
00:56:31,591 --> 00:56:35,005 
What are you trying to do?
He doesn't even know we're cops.

500
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:38,880 
He may panic, and besides,
we don't belong over here anyway.

501
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,105 
I hope he does panic.

502
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:45,440 
Then I'll get him for 23 other murders.

503
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,396 
And if he doesn't...

504
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,810 
...then I may be right about something
that's been nagging at me.

505
00:56:50,925 --> 00:56:52,575 
I sure hope I'm not.

506
00:56:53,342 --> 00:56:54,301 
What?

507
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:57,255 
I don't want to be winning bets
for anybody.

508
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:12,561 
Go a little faster, I'm on their side.

509
00:57:13,366 --> 00:57:16,052 
- Roll down your window.
- What? Are you out of your mind?

510
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:19,312 
- I've never been wrong yet, have I?
- I don't know why I'm doing this.

511
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:23,302 
- Say, excuse me. Could you help us out?
- What do you want?

512
00:57:23,571 --> 00:57:25,911 
Maybe you could help us,
we seem to be lost.

513
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:29,363 
We were looking for the entrance
to San Quentin. You know where that is?

514
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,511 
It's back there. Don't you see too good?

515
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,424 
Yeah, I see fine. I just wanted to know
whether you knew where San Quentin was.

516
00:57:35,616 --> 00:57:37,764 
And you do, don't you, asshole.

517
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:47,086 
Get you yet, you son of a bitch.

518
00:57:50,922 --> 00:57:53,492 
You always gotta do things your way,
don't you?

519
00:57:53,914 --> 00:57:56,024 
No wonder Briggs stays on your tail.

520
00:57:57,904 --> 00:58:01,702 
You do things someone else's way
and you take your life in your own hands.

521
00:58:21,304 --> 00:58:23,030 
That son of a bitch Guzman!

522
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:26,867 
He hasn't gone out for almost
24 hours now.

523
00:58:52,415 --> 00:58:54,180 
Hey, one of our guys took a spill.

524
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,668 
It's Charlie McCoy! Seems to be okay.

525
00:58:59,397 --> 00:59:00,816 
Let me take a look.

526
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:03,578 
Yeah, he's okay.

527
00:59:14,128 --> 00:59:15,700 
There he is.

528
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:19,575 
So, all you've got to do
is sit around all day, Guzman?

529
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,719 
This coke is out of sight!

530
00:59:52,872 --> 00:59:55,251 
Oh, Guzman gets the best, baby.

531
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,435 
Oh, you bitch. Don't spill it.

532
00:59:58,857 --> 01:00:01,082 
That stuff's worth $900 an ounce.

533
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:02,923 
You better not spill it.

534
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,647 
Don't get so uptight.

535
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,560 
Nobody says "don't" to me.
You understand? Nobody.

536
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:13,818 
I never touch the stuff.

537
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:16,503 
You want to put that over there now?

538
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:42,704 
Take over for me, will you, Ed?

539
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:11,129 
Damn, I wish something would happen.

540
01:01:11,513 --> 01:01:12,625 
Take it easy.

541
01:01:13,047 --> 01:01:15,541 
That's what stakeouts are all about.
Waiting.

542
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:32,724 
No, please! No!

543
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,012 
Frank!

544
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:49,714 
- Just what the hell is going on?
- Somebody killed a cop.

545
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:52,707 
Folks, there's been a little trouble here.
Everyone stand back.

546
01:03:52,783 --> 01:03:54,625 
Please, ma'am, move back.

547
01:03:57,425 --> 01:03:59,228 
There's been some trouble.

548
01:04:00,456 --> 01:04:01,491 
What happened?

549
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,829 
Everything seems to be all right, folks.

550
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:06,171 
What's going on?

551
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,008 
Move it, people.

552
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,731 
Please, sir, stand back.

553
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,457 
Yes, sir.

554
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:17,028 
Yes, sir.

555
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,327 
No, sir. We won't let anything
out to the press.

556
01:04:21,784 --> 01:04:22,820 
Yes, sir.

557
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:26,963 
You endangered an entire investigation
by trying to push something.

558
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,920 
Not to mention your own lives.

559
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:31,029 
You blew the whole Palancio stakeout.

560
01:04:31,106 --> 01:04:33,945 
Instead of keeping him under surveillance
as I told you to...

561
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:37,244 
...you had to harass him.
What do you have to say about that?

562
01:04:37,321 --> 01:04:38,855 
What do I tell Avery? What?

563
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:45,492 
You tell him it's not Palancio.
You tell him it's a traffic cop.

564
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:48,292 
A cop?

565
01:04:48,369 --> 01:04:49,405 
That's right.

566
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,821 
A traffic cop. Are you out of your mind?

567
01:04:53,202 --> 01:04:55,964 
Do you expect me to believe
that a traffic cop...

568
01:04:56,348 --> 01:04:59,609 
...is killing off all the top criminals
in the city? Who?

569
01:05:04,135 --> 01:05:05,401 
It's Charlie McCoy.

570
01:05:06,437 --> 01:05:09,698 
He's ready for the rubber gun squad.
He even tried to kill himself.

571
01:05:10,158 --> 01:05:11,347 
Charlie McCoy.

572
01:05:15,298 --> 01:05:17,523 
Guzman was hit today.

573
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:21,935 
A cop was killed. It was Charlie McCoy.

574
01:05:26,346 --> 01:05:28,111 
- McCoy?
- Yes, Charlie McCoy.

575
01:05:29,108 --> 01:05:31,870 
The only reason I don't bust you
into the bag this minute...

576
01:05:31,947 --> 01:05:34,517 
...is I know the two of you
were close friends.

577
01:05:35,169 --> 01:05:38,392 
I was just about to call his wife.
Or you can, if you want to.

578
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,080 
I know he had kids.

579
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:42,036 
Yeah!

580
01:05:43,877 --> 01:05:45,987 
- Who reported it?
- Davis.

581
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:47,176 
Davis?

582
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:49,708 
What happened
to the DiGiorgio stake-out team?

583
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:53,621 
It was an accidental coincidence.
Davis happened to be going by, it happens.

584
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,693 
McCoy was already dead
when he got there.

585
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:57,611 
Any witnesses?

586
01:05:57,841 --> 01:05:58,685 
None.

587
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,749 
- I'll make that call.
- Go ahead.

588
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:08,198 
Harry, if it means anything coming
from me, I'm sorry about Charlie.

589
01:06:08,505 --> 01:06:10,347 
But it's Palancio, believe me.

590
01:06:10,845 --> 01:06:14,144 
I'll have a warrant in 48 hours.
You can pick him up.

591
01:06:14,298 --> 01:06:15,525 
He's all yours.

592
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,662 
Well, thank you for coming, Harry.

593
01:06:52,506 --> 01:06:54,232 
You sure you have to leave?

594
01:06:55,459 --> 01:06:58,605 
I won't have any place to go
for a sit-down dinner anymore.

595
01:06:59,871 --> 01:07:02,288 
I never really did like it here very much.

596
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:05,855 
I always liked the change of seasons.

597
01:07:11,456 --> 01:07:14,602 
I'm going to take him home. It's time.

598
01:07:15,714 --> 01:07:17,556 
It's time he went home.

599
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:24,959 
Come on, kids, let's get in the car.

600
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:37,695 
It was nice of that young man
to help us with the children.

601
01:07:40,342 --> 01:07:43,296 
Goodbye, Harry. We'll all miss you.

602
01:07:44,332 --> 01:07:45,367 
'Bye, doll.

603
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,728 
Take them
to the passenger terminal, please.

604
01:08:04,279 --> 01:08:07,387 
It was nice of you to come out.
You didn't have to do that.

605
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:10,532 
If I'd have been there sooner,
he might still be alive.

606
01:08:11,952 --> 01:08:14,138 
He didn't deserve to get it that way.

607
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:17,591 
If there's anything I can do...

608
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,736 
I feel responsible somehow.

609
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:51,310 
<i>The next shooter is Callahan.</i>
<i>Davis on deck.</i>

610
01:09:31,283 --> 01:09:34,505 
You sure shot the pants off
of everybody with that score, Harry.

611
01:09:34,582 --> 01:09:36,385 
I've never seen you smoother.

612
01:09:36,883 --> 01:09:39,339 
By the way, I personally want to tell you...

613
01:09:39,415 --> 01:09:42,101 
...how sorry I am
about what happened to Charlie.

614
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:47,279 
What I can't figure out, Frank,
is how that kid, Davis, got in there first.

615
01:09:47,356 --> 01:09:49,581 
You guys were right across the street.

616
01:09:49,849 --> 01:09:54,031 
I don't have a goddamned idea, Harry.
The kid came out of nowhere.

617
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,714 
We were in that garage
before you could spit.

618
01:09:58,136 --> 01:10:01,396 
Maybe I'm slowing down in my old age
or something, I don't know.

619
01:10:02,087 --> 01:10:05,961 
I want to be the first to congratulate you
on what I think will be the winning score.

620
01:10:06,038 --> 01:10:07,764 
You shaded me by seven points.

621
01:10:07,994 --> 01:10:10,526 
The only person now
who has a chance is Davis.

622
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,239 
Shoot 'em up!

623
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,798 
I think the kid beat you, Harry.

624
01:10:56,023 --> 01:10:57,135 
It happens.

625
01:10:57,365 --> 01:11:00,012 
<i>Harry, he edged you by four points.</i>

626
01:11:00,396 --> 01:11:02,774 
<i>That evens it up on the overall champion.</i>

627
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,344 
<i>You have your choice in the shoot-off.</i>

628
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:07,761 
<i>Bull's eye or combat?</i>

629
01:11:10,945 --> 01:11:11,712 
Combat.

630
01:11:55,367 --> 01:11:56,288 
Out!

631
01:12:04,497 --> 01:12:06,799 
<i>5:46 seconds. Score, perfect.</i>

632
01:12:08,372 --> 01:12:09,638 
Good luck, sir.

633
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,073 
A good guy!

634
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:50,761 
That last one was a good guy!

635
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,527 
5:36 seconds.
But I'm sorry, Harry, you hit a good guy.

636
01:13:06,642 --> 01:13:08,944 
You had a bad break.
I really don't deserve it.

637
01:13:09,021 --> 01:13:10,210 
You won, didn't you?

638
01:13:10,287 --> 01:13:12,167 
- I guess, but...
- That's all that matters.

639
01:13:12,243 --> 01:13:13,701 
You mind if I try that one?

640
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,603 
Chester, how about six?

641
01:13:39,441 --> 01:13:41,858 
Not bad. I seem to have lost the last one.

642
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:44,927 
You get used to it.

643
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,147 
I can see how you would, at that.

644
01:14:43,773 --> 01:14:46,727 
You said five minutes
and I've been waiting for a half an hour.

645
01:14:46,804 --> 01:14:48,492 
Don't you ever get hungry?

646
01:14:51,675 --> 01:14:55,128 
- It just didn't seem like a half hour.
- Yeah, well it has been.

647
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:58,696 
I went over to my butcher's yesterday
and picked up some veal.

648
01:14:58,772 --> 01:15:02,954 
Pops is really an artist, man. I could
watch that man cut meat all day long.

649
01:15:04,258 --> 01:15:06,214 
Why don't you come home with me and...

650
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:09,130 
My wife's a good cook.
Have a little dinner with us.

651
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:18,835 
No, thanks. I just saw something
that killed my appetite.

652
01:15:26,853 --> 01:15:30,689 
We'll catch those animals with their pants
down. I was going to call you at home.

653
01:15:30,766 --> 01:15:33,182 
We got our search warrants
and multiple charges.

654
01:15:33,259 --> 01:15:35,829 
We're going to make a city-wide raid
tomorrow morning.

655
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:40,011 
Palancio is yours.
Just don't take him out head-first, Harry.

656
01:15:40,509 --> 01:15:44,000 
I think you'll find what I want to show you
in ballistics very interesting.

657
01:15:44,384 --> 01:15:47,606 
You'll find more leads than you can
shake a stick at tomorrow morning.

658
01:15:51,979 --> 01:15:54,012 
- Good morning, Harry. Sir.
- Walter.

659
01:15:54,089 --> 01:15:56,237 
Do you mind excusing us
for a few minutes?

660
01:15:56,314 --> 01:15:57,196 
Sure.

661
01:16:06,288 --> 01:16:07,362 
There's only two.

662
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:10,393 
- I wonder what happened to the others.
- Federal boys have them.

663
01:16:32,642 --> 01:16:33,294 
Well?

664
01:16:34,062 --> 01:16:35,366 
Take a look.

665
01:16:40,314 --> 01:16:41,926 
Close, real close.

666
01:16:42,1000 --> 01:16:45,838 
But there's still a lot of lines
that don't match up.

667
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:48,217 
All this proves is that these two bullets...

668
01:16:48,294 --> 01:16:51,593 
...came from barrels
with a similar twist and width of rifling.

669
01:16:51,938 --> 01:16:54,086 
You don't think it would stand up
as evidence?

670
01:16:54,163 --> 01:16:55,621 
As it is, no.

671
01:16:55,697 --> 01:16:58,459 
But I'll have a full comparison report made,
no problem.

672
01:16:58,536 --> 01:17:01,567 
You're probably right.
Besides, it isn't necessary yet.

673
01:17:01,912 --> 01:17:03,293 
What do you mean, "yet"?

674
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:05,441 
Where'd you get that slug?

675
01:17:05,518 --> 01:17:09,085 
- I'd just as soon not say for the time being.
- Don't play games on this.

676
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,696 
Whose side are you on anyway?

677
01:17:10,773 --> 01:17:13,343 
It's just a wild shot
and I'm probably wrong.

678
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:16,105 
I'd like to handle it my own way.

679
01:17:17,026 --> 01:17:20,402 
By the way, I'd like to have Davis
and Sweet as my back-up squad tomorrow.

680
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:23,548 
They're just rookies for Christ's sake.

681
01:17:23,624 --> 01:17:27,307 
You drum up somebody in the department
who can shoot as well and I'll use them.

682
01:17:27,345 --> 01:17:29,762 
Goddamn it,
there isn't supposed to be any shooting.

683
01:17:30,414 --> 01:17:33,368 
Besides, they don't have the experience yet
for a job like this.

684
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:37,281 
How the hell's a man supposed to get
experience if nobody gives him a chance?

685
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:39,276 
And Davis is the new pistol champion.

686
01:17:39,544 --> 01:17:41,424 
Suppose they panic and start shooting?

687
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:48,329 
Nothing wrong with shooting,
as long as the right people get shot.

688
01:18:04,134 --> 01:18:06,666 
- Let him know who you are and keep cool.
- Okay.

689
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:10,195 
I want you to keep an eye
on Davis and Sweet.

690
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,269 
What for?

691
01:18:11,499 --> 01:18:12,995 
Just do it, will you?

692
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,719 
All right.

693
01:18:16,141 --> 01:18:17,982 
- You all set?
- All set.

694
01:18:18,059 --> 01:18:19,670 
We'll take off in three cars.

695
01:18:19,747 --> 01:18:22,279 
Davis and Sweet will make the arrest.
Early will cover.

696
01:18:22,355 --> 01:18:25,578 
I'll be on the back at the pier
in case anybody makes a break for it.

697
01:18:25,616 --> 01:18:27,994 
If there'll be trouble, that's where it'll start.

698
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:31,255 
We're holding the other squads back
until you've made your arrest.

699
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:35,206 
Yours is the most important, it'll be
the first. We don't want any foul-ups.

700
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,048 
- Right?
- Right.

701
01:18:38,966 --> 01:18:42,303 
I'd never walk up to a door with Harry,
too many people don't like him.

702
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:45,142 
Thanks. I needed that.

703
01:18:48,594 --> 01:18:50,052 
- You boys ready?
- Yes, sir.

704
01:18:50,129 --> 01:18:53,236 
- Thank you for requesting us.
- Sir, we won't let you down.

705
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:55,077 
Well, I'm depending on that.

706
01:19:48,745 --> 01:19:49,665 
Nickie.

707
01:19:59,908 --> 01:20:00,828 
Yeah?

708
01:20:04,051 --> 01:20:05,163 
Who is this?

709
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,066 
What was that, Nickie?

710
01:20:16,633 --> 01:20:20,201 
Somebody said we'll be hit in two minutes.
They'll be dressed like cops.

711
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:23,960 
Did it sound like anybody you know?

712
01:20:24,497 --> 01:20:25,955 
No, I couldn't tell.

713
01:20:41,146 --> 01:20:42,796 
Ed, Chuck...

714
01:20:45,711 --> 01:20:47,399 
...get over to the windows.

715
01:20:50,967 --> 01:20:52,232 
I got the water side.

716
01:20:52,271 --> 01:20:54,304 
I'll take the street side.

717
01:20:54,573 --> 01:20:56,606 
If they are cops, this could be a set-up.

718
01:20:56,682 --> 01:20:59,521 
After the holes they put in Ricca
you want me to wait and see?

719
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:01,516 
If they're cops, they'll have papers.

720
01:21:01,593 --> 01:21:02,859 
Car coming, Frank.

721
01:21:03,664 --> 01:21:05,505 
There's a big guy out there.

722
01:21:09,226 --> 01:21:11,298 
- He got a uniform on?
- No.

723
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:15,978 
He ain't no cop.
Cops always come in the front door.

724
01:21:16,477 --> 01:21:17,551 
Another car.

725
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,888 
Why didn't they come in squad cars
if they're cops?

726
01:21:21,003 --> 01:21:23,727 
That big guy's working himself around
by those containers.

727
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:26,988 
He's got a gun out.

728
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:29,059 
Two uniforms in it.

729
01:21:30,325 --> 01:21:31,975 
That ain't no cop's gun, Frank.

730
01:21:37,345 --> 01:21:39,915 
There's a cop in uniform coming up
to the door.

731
01:21:45,746 --> 01:21:48,163 
We aren't open. Come back tomorrow.

732
01:21:48,854 --> 01:21:51,501 
Police officers,
we'd like to ask you some questions.

733
01:21:51,577 --> 01:21:53,802 
Yeah, I'm just a watchman. Nobody's here.

734
01:21:54,032 --> 01:21:55,912 
We're looking for Mr. Frank Palancio.

735
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:58,674 
Would you open the door?
We have a warrant for his arrest.

736
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:00,515 
I said nobody's here, goddamn it!

737
01:22:00,554 --> 01:22:02,740 
We have warrants
for a search of the premises.

738
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:03,661 
Serve them!

739
01:22:18,545 --> 01:22:20,924 
They got Sweet! Send some help! Quick!

740
01:23:06,842 --> 01:23:07,916 
<i>Cease firing.</i>

741
01:23:07,993 --> 01:23:11,253 
<i>Throw your weapons out and come out</i>
<i>with your hands behind your heads.</i>

742
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:12,980 
- Bullshit!
- Fuck you!

743
01:25:07,718 --> 01:25:11,708 
You sure you don't want a local for this?
Takes about seven stitches.

744
01:25:11,784 --> 01:25:12,859 
No, thanks.

745
01:25:14,508 --> 01:25:16,196 
Okay, it's your ass.

746
01:25:17,462 --> 01:25:19,418 
My head, cut's on my head.

747
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:23,907 
Why does everybody suddenly
become a comedian in here?

748
01:25:24,213 --> 01:25:26,055 
Does he have to stay in here?

749
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:30,888 
No, I could stop and let the man's
brains run out all over his shoes.

750
01:25:31,349 --> 01:25:34,686 
Rogers, I don't need to have a doctor
display that kind of attitude.

751
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:36,451 
A police officer is dead.

752
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:38,254 
Sorry.

753
01:25:39,942 --> 01:25:42,857 
I got those warrants
for a search of the premises, Callahan...

754
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:45,772 
...not for you to become
judge, jury and executioner.

755
01:25:45,888 --> 01:25:47,767 
It was supposed to be a simple arrest.

756
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:52,255 
Arresting a killer like Palancio
isn't always simple.

757
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,135 
People are guilty until proven...

758
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,017 
I mean...

759
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,086 
Goddamn it, you know what I mean.

760
01:25:58,508 --> 01:26:01,462 
The city's on the edge
of the worst violence in its history...

761
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:04,147 
...and you have to start
full-scale military operations.

762
01:26:04,224 --> 01:26:07,523 
I didn't start shooting at anyone
who didn't start shooting at me first.

763
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,705 
Each time you pull out that gun,
my paperwork backs up for three months.

764
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:14,697 
The chief and I have already
conferred on this matter.

765
01:26:14,774 --> 01:26:16,998 
A full investigation is warranted here.

766
01:26:21,909 --> 01:26:23,482 
What about a dead cop?

767
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:28,238 
- I warned you against taking them.
- Sweet was killed with the first shot.

768
01:26:28,507 --> 01:26:32,228 
Besides they were tipped off.
They knew we were coming, Briggs.

769
01:26:32,573 --> 01:26:34,798 
How? Don't hand me that crap.

770
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:38,711 
They knew we were coming.
After 200 arrests, I know the difference.

771
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:44,120 
If I have my way, Callahan, you won't make
another arrest as long as you live.

772
01:26:46,345 --> 01:26:47,687 
Is that all, Lieutenant?

773
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,373 
No, that's not all.

774
01:26:51,869 --> 01:26:53,480 
I want that slug you showed me.

775
01:26:55,551 --> 01:26:59,273 
I ran that through ballistics, it was nothing.
The rifling was totally different.

776
01:26:59,349 --> 01:27:01,881 
It's still State's evidence.
I want it anyway.

777
01:27:06,676 --> 01:27:07,635 
Eat it.

778
01:27:28,926 --> 01:27:33,759 
Look, Harry, if it means anything,
I think you got the wrong end of the stick.

779
01:27:33,798 --> 01:27:35,485 
- You do?
- Yeah.

780
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:37,710 
What did they find when they got in there?

781
01:27:37,864 --> 01:27:41,163 
Nothing. Palancio was as clean
as he could possibly be.

782
01:27:41,853 --> 01:27:43,848 
They knew we were coming, Harry.

783
01:27:44,078 --> 01:27:46,265 
Why do you figure they opened up on us?

784
01:27:46,687 --> 01:27:49,487 
They must've thought
it was a set-up like the others.

785
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:51,789 
- It was.
- No.

786
01:27:53,093 --> 01:27:54,666 
It was a set-up, Early.

787
01:27:56,277 --> 01:28:00,459 
What I'll lay on you seems so far-fetched,
I can't even believe it myself.

788
01:28:01,418 --> 01:28:04,525 
I gave up being surprised
working with you anyway.

789
01:28:05,407 --> 01:28:07,555 
Would you be surprised if I told you...

790
01:28:07,632 --> 01:28:11,468 
...a bunch of rookie cops were the ones
who were doing all the killing?

791
01:28:12,734 --> 01:28:13,655 
See this?

792
01:28:13,847 --> 01:28:16,455 
I gave Briggs a phony for the time being.

793
01:28:17,069 --> 01:28:19,409 
This is a bullet I took out
of the target range.

794
01:28:19,486 --> 01:28:21,365 
It came from Davis' gun.

795
01:28:21,519 --> 01:28:24,741 
It matches up with the one
taken out of Charlie McCoy's body.

796
01:28:25,317 --> 01:28:27,120 
Davis? That's insane.

797
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,879 
Maybe so, but somebody tipped-off
Palancio that we were coming.

798
01:28:31,109 --> 01:28:34,907 
Wanting me killed or Palancio
or hopefully both.

799
01:28:35,367 --> 01:28:38,628 
Yeah, but Sweet died today.

800
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,776 
Sweet was sacrificed.

801
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:45,034 
What's more important if I'm right,
I'll be sacrificed.

802
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:48,525 
They've gotta figure I told you,
which means you'll be sacrificed.

803
01:28:51,172 --> 01:28:52,285 
Yeah.

804
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:57,617 
If anything happens to me,
I want you to give that to Lt. Briggs.

805
01:28:57,694 --> 01:28:58,653 
Okay.

806
01:28:58,729 --> 01:29:00,532 
What happens if they get us both?

807
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,143 
Then they win.

808
01:29:04,982 --> 01:29:08,588 
It's not hard to understand
how this could happen, the way things are.

809
01:29:08,742 --> 01:29:12,616 
As incredible as it seems, there may be
a sub-organization within the police force.

810
01:29:12,693 --> 01:29:16,299 
Sort of a death squad
like they had in Brazil some years back.

811
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:18,370 
Damn.

812
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:24,355 
Some nights I wake up, wonder
where the hell the world's going to.

813
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,917 
I want you to take care of yourself,
you understand?

814
01:30:01,296 --> 01:30:02,102 
Hi!

815
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:03,483 
Hi.

816
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:06,053 
Jesus, what happened to your face?

817
01:30:06,629 --> 01:30:08,508 
Nothing, just a few stitches.

818
01:30:10,388 --> 01:30:13,802 
I was going to the market,
how about if I bring back a few beers?

819
01:30:14,186 --> 01:30:16,564 
Good, I could use a beer right about now.

820
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:18,943 
I've got your key, so I'll get your mail, too.

821
01:30:19,058 --> 01:30:20,170 
All right, baby.

822
01:30:20,669 --> 01:30:21,820 
Keep it warm.

823
01:30:45,987 --> 01:30:48,941 
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to prosecute a cop?

824
01:31:06,395 --> 01:31:09,042 
You heroes have killed
a dozen people this week.

825
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:12,648 
What are you gonna do next week?

826
01:31:15,372 --> 01:31:16,791 
Kill a dozen more.

827
01:31:18,211 --> 01:31:20,589 
Is that what you guys are all about,
being heroes?

828
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:22,315 
All our heroes are dead.

829
01:31:22,737 --> 01:31:24,502 
We are the first generation...

830
01:31:24,847 --> 01:31:26,573 
...that's learned to fight.

831
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:30,141 
We're simply ridding society
of killers that would be caught...

832
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:33,172 
...and sentenced anyway
if our courts worked properly.

833
01:31:34,783 --> 01:31:38,082 
We began with the criminals
that the people know...

834
01:31:39,616 --> 01:31:42,186 
...so that our actions would be understood.

835
01:31:43,376 --> 01:31:46,943 
It's not just a question
of whether or not to use violence.

836
01:31:48,631 --> 01:31:50,933 
There simply is no other way, Inspector.

837
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:53,656 
You of all people...

838
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,150 
...should understand that.

839
01:31:59,142 --> 01:32:01,559 
Either you're for us or you're against us.

840
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:09,691 
I'm afraid you've misjudged me.

841
01:34:07,844 --> 01:34:09,302 
- Hi, Sunny.
- Hi, Sue.

842
01:34:16,283 --> 01:34:17,434 
No, no!

843
01:34:18,623 --> 01:34:20,887 
Harry, what are you doing?

844
01:34:27,677 --> 01:34:29,480 
Hey, what's going on down here?

845
01:34:29,825 --> 01:34:32,395 
I'm taking the mailbox apart,
what does it look like?

846
01:34:32,472 --> 01:34:34,735 
- You people live here, don't you?
- Yeah.

847
01:34:35,579 --> 01:34:38,456 
What are you doing to the mailbox?
Did you lose you key?

848
01:34:38,533 --> 01:34:40,835 
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business.

849
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:44,709 
That's my mailbox, too.
Don't you get smart with me!

850
01:34:46,052 --> 01:34:48,238 
Tampering with the mail
is a federal offense.

851
01:34:48,507 --> 01:34:50,041 
I'm calling the police.

852
01:34:50,924 --> 01:34:52,113 
I am the police.

853
01:34:53,686 --> 01:34:54,530 
What?

854
01:34:56,716 --> 01:34:58,174 
The cop that lives upstairs?

855
01:35:16,357 --> 01:35:17,278 
What's that?

856
01:35:19,234 --> 01:35:20,577 
Plastic explosive.

857
01:35:22,687 --> 01:35:23,684 
A bomb?

858
01:35:24,259 --> 01:35:25,180 
That's right.

859
01:35:25,257 --> 01:35:28,402 
If you'd bothered me any more,
we'd all be stuck to the ceiling.

860
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:31,510 
- Do you want to hold it?
- No. I don't want to get involved.

861
01:35:34,348 --> 01:35:37,226 
Go to your apartment and stay there.
Don't open for anybody.

862
01:37:04,996 --> 01:37:08,218 
Homicide, Lt. Briggs,
Inspector Callahan calling.

863
01:37:11,057 --> 01:37:12,860 
Callahan, where are you?

864
01:37:13,205 --> 01:37:15,584 
Look, Briggs,
I just found a bomb in my mailbox.

865
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:18,346 
I want you to get a man
over to Early's house right away.

866
01:37:18,691 --> 01:37:19,458 
What?

867
01:37:19,535 --> 01:37:21,415 
I've got a bomb right here!

868
01:37:21,568 --> 01:37:23,640 
Now get a man over to Early's,
you hear me?

869
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:25,327 
Right.

870
01:37:26,171 --> 01:37:28,703 
Stay right where you are.
I'll be down there myself.

871
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:29,816 
Don't move.

872
01:38:11,092 --> 01:38:12,051 
Yeah?

873
01:38:21,066 --> 01:38:22,140 
Come on in.

874
01:38:24,864 --> 01:38:26,820 
I don't like looking down one of those.

875
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,424 
Where's the bomb?

876
01:38:32,383 --> 01:38:33,841 
Right on the dresser.

877
01:38:36,449 --> 01:38:39,978 
All right. Let's get out of here.

878
01:38:40,937 --> 01:38:42,587 
Avery will want to see this.

879
01:38:52,906 --> 01:38:55,937 
You mind driving?
I want to take a closer look at this thing.

880
01:39:17,381 --> 01:39:20,143 
This thing could be activated
by your mailbox key.

881
01:39:21,408 --> 01:39:22,636 
Or by a timer.

882
01:39:26,242 --> 01:39:27,546 
Turn right, here.

883
01:39:32,111 --> 01:39:33,531 
Get on the freeway.

884
01:39:34,681 --> 01:39:35,832 
The freeway?

885
01:39:36,945 --> 01:39:39,208 
You got a new route to city hall,
Lieutenant?

886
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,294 
Your gun's out of its holster, Briggs.
First time?

887
01:39:50,525 --> 01:39:52,634 
You know you're not going to city hall.

888
01:39:52,673 --> 01:39:55,627 
The only way you're going anywhere
is in a rubber bag.

889
01:39:56,317 --> 01:39:57,545 
Let me have your gun.

890
01:40:16,649 --> 01:40:17,915 
Now the shells.

891
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:24,551 
Three. You always carry three.

892
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:31,379 
Throw them out the window.

893
01:40:37,249 --> 01:40:39,742 
How do you figure on pulling this off,
Briggs?

894
01:40:39,819 --> 01:40:43,425 
I run the investigation, with your record,
I can make anything stick.

895
01:40:44,614 --> 01:40:47,184 
What I can't understand is,
why you of all people?

896
01:40:47,299 --> 01:40:50,138 
A hundred years ago in this city,
people did the same thing.

897
01:40:50,176 --> 01:40:53,053 
History justified the vigilantes,
we're no different.

898
01:40:53,437 --> 01:40:56,851 
Anyone who threatens the security
of the people will be executed.

899
01:40:57,350 --> 01:41:01,531 
- Evil for evil, Harry. Retribution.
- That's just fine.

900
01:41:02,337 --> 01:41:04,025 
But how does murder fit in?

901
01:41:04,677 --> 01:41:07,247 
When police start becoming
their own executioners...

902
01:41:07,324 --> 01:41:09,319 
...where's it gonna end, Briggs?

903
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:12,848 
Pretty soon, you'll start executing people
for jaywalking.

904
01:41:12,924 --> 01:41:15,380 
And executing people for traffic violations.

905
01:41:15,763 --> 01:41:19,638 
Then you end up executing your neighbor
'cause his dog pisses on your lawn.

906
01:41:20,251 --> 01:41:23,742 
There isn't one man we've killed that
didn't deserve what was coming to him.

907
01:41:23,819 --> 01:41:26,044 
Yes, there is. Charlie McCoy.

908
01:41:26,428 --> 01:41:27,924 
What would you have done?

909
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,458 
I'd have upheld the law.

910
01:41:29,535 --> 01:41:31,760 
What the hell do you know about the law?

911
01:41:31,837 --> 01:41:33,486 
You're a great cop, Harry.

912
01:41:33,716 --> 01:41:37,054 
You had a chance to join the team,
but you'd rather stick to the system.

913
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:40,545 
Briggs, I hate the goddamn system.
But until someone comes along...

914
01:41:40,621 --> 01:41:43,307 
...with some changes that make sense,
I'll stick with it.

915
01:41:43,959 --> 01:41:45,877 
You're about to become extinct.

916
01:41:50,327 --> 01:41:51,976 
Get off at the next exit.

917
01:50:34,648 --> 01:50:35,453 
Red?

918
01:51:05,106 --> 01:51:05,912 
Red?

919
01:53:19,869 --> 01:53:23,514 
Briggs was right.
You guys don't have enough experience.

920
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:04,752 
Just hold it right there, Callahan.

921
01:54:06,478 --> 01:54:07,514 
No tricks.

922
01:54:18,984 --> 01:54:20,825 
Your organization's through, Briggs.

923
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:25,007 
There's a lot more where they came from,
believe me.

924
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:28,306 
Move out of the way. Move it!

925
01:54:55,159 --> 01:54:56,425 
Uphold the law.

926
01:54:58,995 --> 01:55:01,833 
You just killed three police officers, Harry.

927
01:55:06,092 --> 01:55:08,585 
And the only reason
I'm not gonna kill you...

928
01:55:09,084 --> 01:55:12,038 
...is because I'm gonna prosecute you
with your own system.

929
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:21,858 
It'll be my word against yours.

930
01:55:23,354 --> 01:55:25,119 
And who's gonna believe you?

931
01:55:26,039 --> 01:55:29,185 
You're a killer, Harry. A maniac!

932
01:56:23,543 --> 01:56:25,806 
A man's got to know his limitations.
