1
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,013
This is a. 44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world.

2
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,016
And it could blow your head clean off.

3
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,477
Do you feel lucky?

4
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,820
Mr. Ricca!
How do you feel about your acquittal?

5
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,365
It proves what I always said,
I had nothing to do with Scarza's murder.

6
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,909
Who could have killed
Anthony Scarza and his family?

7
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,662
That's a stupid question. Get off my back!

8
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,167
Mr. Weinstein, explain the technicality
involving the lack of admissible evidence.

9
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,295
That's a legality
that can't be explained at this time.

10
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,214
Mr. Weinstein, you don't seem surprised
about the decision.

11
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,884
I don't know why they waste
the taxpayers' money.

12
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,013
This whole thing is an arbitrary attack
on a legitimate businessman.

13
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,265
- Do you have any comments?
- What, dear?

14
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,100
Do you have any other comments?

15
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,603
I'll give you a comment:
Their minds are dead.

16
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,105
- What do you mean by that?
- Their minds are dead.

17
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,774
Mr. Ricca means he is very pleased
with the decision.

18
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,943
There's a big crowd.
Do you fear for your life?

19
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,820
No, of course not.

20
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,490
Mr. Estabrook.

21
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,535
As the prosecutor,
how do you feel about the court's decision?

22
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,954
It's happened before,
it'll probably happen again.

23
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,331
I have no more comments.

24
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,170
I'm sorry, no comments. No comments!

25
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,671
I have no comments.

26
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,314
You know what I think?
I'll tell you what I think!

27
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,316
Fuck the courts, that's what I think!

28
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,320
They've already wasted too much time
worrying about the rights of killers!

29
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,489
Ricca, you're a killer!

30
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,751
Get in the car! Go on!

31
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,353
Will you please back off?
We've made all of our comments.

32
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,190
There is nothing that I can add.

33
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,612
Murderer!

34
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,051
Today the noted labor leader
Carmine Ricca...

35
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,680
...was acquitted on a technicality:
the lack of admissible evidence.

36
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,558
Ricca had been charged with complicity...

37
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,562
...in the murders of labor reformer
Anthony Scarza and his family.

38
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,274
When he appeared outside
the courthouse this afternoon, a free man...

39
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,444
...it touched off a wild,
mob-like demonstration.

40
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,488
But the police were finally able
to bring it under control...

41
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,074
...and there have been
no reports of injuries.

42
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,078
But one can expect an uproar
from an angry and alarmed crowd...

43
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,081
...which fully expected Ricca
to be convicted.

44
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:36,252
And I'm sure we haven't heard
the last of the Ricca case.

45
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,629
Art Brown reporting from city hall.

46
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,071
Cop.

47
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,824
Gino, for chrissake.

48
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,869
Come on, Carmine.
I'm driving this thing like a baby carriage.

49
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,217
Could I see your driver's license, please?

50
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,136
Do you know who that is
sitting back there?

51
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,222
I'll still have to see
your driver's license, please.

52
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,391
I'll have to find it.

53
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,560
Do you know why you're being stopped?

54
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,482
Yes, we know, officer,
and you're making a big mistake.

55
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,526
- You crossed a double line back there.
- A double line?

56
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,236
Take it easy.

57
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,614
Whatever you say, officer.

58
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,202
I just happened to find it, sir.

59
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,920
That's right, Simple Simon.

60
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,590
Check, see if it's stolen.

61
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,092
I want this bastard busted out of his job.

62
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,597
We'll take care of this guy.
You fellas, just take it easy.

63
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,154
- This car registered to you?
- To him.

64
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:55,159
- I'll have to see the registration.
- Come on, give me that license.

65
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,078
Hi, Harry. Is this your case?

66
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,433
Walter?

67
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,187
Hello, Harry. What are you doing here?

68
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,648
This couldn't have happened
to a nicer bunch.

69
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,777
Ricca, Weinstein, his attorney.
James Cantina, the driver.

70
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,362
What about the bodyguard?

71
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,865
We're checking that out now, lieutenant.

72
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,869
Looks like somebody saved
the taxpayers a lot of money, doesn't it?

73
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:24,123
Callahan, what are you doing here?
You're on loan to stakeout.

74
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,209
We had nothing hot on,
besides, we were close.

75
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,714
Callahan, you get your lying ass in gear
and get back to that stakeout squad.

76
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,342
Anything else, you call it in.

77
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,558
- Who do you think did this, Briggs?
- You're on loan to stakeout, Callahan.

78
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,269
That's right, lieutenant, you saw to that.

79
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,397
I've got nothing personal
against you, Callahan.

80
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,817
But we can't have the public crying,
"police brutality"...

81
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,611
...every time you're on the street.

82
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,405
You just might need me on a job like this.

83
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,699
Whoever did this was very good at it.

84
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,826
You'd sure be the one to know, Harry.

85
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,246
- Well, I just work for this city, Briggs.
- So do I.

86
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,540
Longer than you.

87
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:11,045
And I never had to take my gun out
of its holster once. I'm proud of that.

88
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,632
Well, you're a good man, lieutenant.

89
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,426
A good man always knows his limitations.

90
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,596
Lt. Briggs?

91
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,141
Yeah.

92
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,102
What did you get?

93
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,771
Well, it looks like
they were killed with a Magnum.

94
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,775
The boys now are checking
the blood types and for fingerprints.

95
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,113
What do you have?

96
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,243
Driver's license. Doesn't look at all
like the usual gangster crap, does it?

97
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,287
Briggs has his nose up his ass today.

98
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,291
I guess he thinks
that's where his promotion is.

99
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,293
See you later, Harry.

100
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,797
What's with you and Briggs anyway?

101
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,590
Jealousy.

102
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,886
He knows this is the kind of case
I should be on. It's just a matter of time.

103
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,806
Hey, Early, wanna get in on this?

104
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,976
What the hell is that about?

105
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,479
They're giving odds on how long
you'll stay alive being my partner.

106
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,107
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.

107
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,942
How long did your last partner go?

108
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,193
A couple of weeks.

109
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,530
Don't worry, he's still alive,
teaching college.

110
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,199
You have another trade, Smith?

111
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,703
- No, no. Do you?
- No, but Bill Mackenzie does.

112
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,955
Who in the hell is Bill Mackenzie?

113
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,041
He's an ex-Homicide man,
has a snack shop out at the airport.

114
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,502
Greatest burgers in town. Hungry?

115
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,423
- How can you be hungry after seeing that?
- Seeing what?

116
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,444
So Ricca finally bought it.
There must be hope for the world yet.

117
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,529
How about you? Do you want something?

118
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,658
- We got chili and garlic bread today.
- No, thank you. I don't feel very hungry.

119
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,245
In broad daylight at close range?
Must've looked like ripe melons.

120
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,542
Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix,
use white courtesy telephone.

121
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,211
Now all keep calm.

122
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,466
I'll never forget the Floyd case.

123
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,760
Got it with an axe during the rush hour.

124
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,887
How about some cream pie?

125
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,681
- Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix...
- I don't think so.

126
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,184
- ... use white courtesy telephone.
- Must be trouble.

127
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,812
That's the airport code-name for trouble.

128
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:38,901
American Airlines flight 577,
flagship, nonstop for Washington...

129
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,779
...may now be boarded at Gate 5.

130
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:46,242
American Airlines, final call, flight 577...

131
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,203
...flagship for Washington...

132
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,123
...boarding at Gate 5.
All aboard, please.

133
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,442
We've got 90 people being terrorized
by those maniacs...

134
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,278
...in boarding area B right now.

135
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,406
What's taking so long?
They said they'd be there in 15 minutes.

136
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,949
Where's that overseas pilot?

137
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,785
I don't understand.
How did they get through security?

138
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,829
- I don't know.
- Any problem here?

139
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,455
What are you doing here?

140
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,333
- I'm sorry, you'll have to leave.
- I'm a police officer.

141
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,212
We've got two frantic hijackers
on our New York flight.

142
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,799
- Have you called the FBI?
- They're on their way here right now.

143
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,802
But the hijackers want an overseas pilot
before they take off.

144
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,975
May I make a suggestion?

145
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,176
Good afternoon.

146
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,429
You took your goddamn time about it.
Now, close that door!

147
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,389
All right, what's in there?

148
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,684
Overseas charts and flight plans.

149
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,603
Set it down!

150
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,522
All right, turn around.

151
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,030
Stay there.

152
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,166
All right, turn around here.

153
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,044
Here! Now get in there.

154
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,676
- It's all yours now.
- All right, get this thing up!

155
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,389
Where to?

156
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,101
You get us up,
I'll tell you where to when we're up.

157
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,191
You wanna put us in take-off position?

158
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,406
Starting three.

159
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,795
Move it!

160
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,299
All right, I'll take it.

161
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,333
That's right, lieutenant. We were lucky
to have one of your men here.

162
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,877
He's onboard now, an Inspector Callahan.

163
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,504
Callahan!

164
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,191
Excuse me, captain.
I know this may sound silly...

165
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,818
...but can you fly?

166
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,114
No. Never had a lesson.

167
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,892
Sit down!

168
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,064
What are you doing here, lieutenant?

169
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,091
Hi, Harry.

170
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,976
Harry. You crazy son of a bitch.
I could've killed you.

171
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,979
Yeah, I noticed that, Charlie.
What the hell you doing?

172
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,065
I haven't seen you in a coon's age.

173
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,027
I been meaning to drop by,
but we've been kind of busy.

174
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,948
Yeah, well,
I ain't living with Carol anymore.

175
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,658
Sorry to hear that.

176
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:47,829
Yeah. It's my third time at bat.

177
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,831
Where's the time go?

178
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,001
I'm afraid of time.

179
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:57,756
I know you 10 years already, ever since
I first came out here, you realize that?

180
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,843
You don't look older to me.
Do I look older to you?

181
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,807
Why don't you put in
for some desk work, Charlie?

182
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,725
You don't need the streets anymore.

183
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,061
We should've put our 20 in the Marines.

184
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,315
These days,
a cop kills a hoodlum on the street...

185
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,859
...he might as well just dump
the body someplace.

186
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,362
Because those snot-nosed
young bastards...

187
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,032
...down at the DA's office will crucify them
one way or another.

188
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,077
A hood can kill a cop,
but let a cop kill a hood...

189
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,413
Am I right?

190
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:35,210
You put in plenty of time,
why don't you go for retirement?

191
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,462
What the hell, you don't need this.

192
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,508
I know you 10 years.
I'll tell you something, I'll never retire.

193
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,802
Never.

194
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,722
I'm going out fighting.

195
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,350
That's the only way to go. Am I right?

196
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,696
You boys rookies?

197
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,782
Yes, sir. Traffic.

198
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,951
I'm John Davis. This is Phil Sweet.

199
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,288
That's Red Astrachan, Mike Grimes.

200
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,124
- You're Inspector Harry Callahan, no?
- That's right.

201
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,211
What are you doing here?
Don't you have regular times for this?

202
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,130
You shouldn't be on the streets
if you can't shoot well.

203
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,759
- Killers don't make allowances.
- You're in big trouble.

204
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,135
Can't fault you there.

205
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,805
Are you shooting
in the combat championship next week?

206
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,014
I always do.

207
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,643
- You win every year, don't you?
- Became sort of an institution around here.

208
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,479
Yes, sir, we've heard all about you.

209
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,442
This is about the only time
I get this place alone.

210
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,320
We'll leave if you'd like
the range to yourself.

211
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,492
No, that's all right.

212
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,163
What kind of a load
do you use in that. 44?

213
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,665
A light special.

214
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,543
This size gun gives me better control
and less recoil...

215
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,337
...than a. 357 Magnum with wadcutters.

216
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,702
That's not bad.

217
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,580
Care to try?

218
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,373
No, sir. No, I don't think so.

219
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,209
- Come on, give it a try.
- Go on, Sweet.

220
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,173
I'm farsighted.

221
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,388
Don't drop it.

222
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,658
Hey, that's not bad.

223
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,245
Well, I think it's just a little
heavy for me. I missed one.

224
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,955
You'll get used to it.

225
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,333
Where did you learn to shoot?
Not around here.

226
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,878
No, sir, no.
Airborne Rangers, Special Forces.

227
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,256
And the rest of these guys, even close?

228
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,259
Well, Grimes here, he's...

229
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,428
I guess he's about even with me.

230
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,723
- Astrachan's a little better on a good day.
- A little bit.

231
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,101
And Davis is just dog nuts.
He's a lot better.

232
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:25,857
A lot better? Sure show a sense of style.
Sweet, is it?

233
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,275
Yes, sir.

234
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,403
When I get back on Homicide,
I hope you boys will come see me.

235
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,572
- Good.
- Thank you very much, we'd like that.

236
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,157
Let's go!

237
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,243
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

238
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,788
Who buys? The sun was in my eyes.

239
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,291
- You got to be on, Grimes.
- The sun is always in your eyes.

240
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,962
How come I always have to buy
the beer for you turkeys?

241
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,715
Where do you want to go?

242
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,015
Put your hat on!

243
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,891
Come on now, baby.

244
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,696
Will you look at my ring?!

245
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,721
It's beautiful!

246
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,303
Is this a gang war?

247
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,013
You have nothing to say?

248
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:48,017
- Do you expect more murder or violence?
- I have nothing to say at this time.

249
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,645
- Is this a gang war, lieutenant?
- No comment.

250
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:55,150
There were 200 murders last year.
Do you want to make a comment on that?

251
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,489
There'll be no bombs in pools.
This town belongs to the people.

252
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,325
We're gonna have law and order here.

253
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,494
That's all I have to say at this time.

254
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,830
What does that mean, lieutenant?

255
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,343
- You're it.
- You're it.

256
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,141
You're it.

257
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,727
Don't you want to play with us?

258
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,897
- Well, I don't know, sweetheart.
- Just a little while?

259
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,232
You're really getting the full treatment.

260
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,860
It's not often you get a sit-down dinner.

261
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:44,574
Okay, kids. All right, that's enough.

262
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,453
- Just a little bit more, just five minutes?
- Let's go, let's go.

263
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,872
Say good night to Harry and off to bed.

264
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,041
- Good night.
- Good night, my love.

265
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,461
- Good night.
- Take it easy.

266
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,672
- Bye.
- Good night, Harry.

267
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,970
Take the jacket out of your mouth,
sweetheart.

268
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,441
Boy, sometimes they're too much for me.

269
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,403
But then I can't afford
a woman coming in anymore.

270
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,906
I think you manage quite well.

271
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,075
Well, I just laugh all day long.

272
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,411
I'm glad you called.

273
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,959
Tell me, have you seen Charlie?

274
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,920
Yes, I saw him last night.

275
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,421
Wanted to see the kids...

276
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,259
...and then he started playing
a little Russian roulette with his revolver.

277
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,553
What happened?

278
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,598
What could I do? I went next door,
we finally got him to stop.

279
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,308
What do you tell your children...

280
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,645
...when they ask why their father
tried to shoot himself?

281
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,273
What did you tell them?

282
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,610
I just said it was a special kind of
sickness that some people have...

283
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,948
...and that there are doctors
who could cure it. As if they could.

284
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,579
Do you know where he's living right now?

285
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,165
I don't know and I don't care anymore.

286
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,589
He's so sick.
He shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun.

287
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,264
Do you know that he was living
in North Beach with some nude dancer?

288
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,481
Oh, well, I'm glad I'm over that one.

289
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,985
I do have to survive.

290
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,154
You will.

291
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:54,245
You know, Harry, if I ask you
a personal question, would you mind?

292
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,080
Sure, go ahead.

293
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:01,377
Are you sure?
Because, well, it's a little difficult.

294
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,174
Look, we've been friends a long time,
go ahead and ask.

295
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:14,432
Well, I'm just wondering
why you've never made a pass at me.

296
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,814
Why?

297
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,487
Goddamn it.

298
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:33,117
With all those kids
do you think I'll ever get laid?

299
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,336
Hello?

300
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,215
Yes, just a moment.

301
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,384
It's for you.

302
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,886
What's happening?

303
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,721
Yeah?

304
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,307
Yeah, Early, I saw it on TV.

305
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,312
I'll be right down.
I'll come in the back way.

306
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,859
- That's it, right?
- I have to go.

307
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,153
Good night, Harry.

308
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,657
Good night, sweetheart.

309
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,803
How's it going?

310
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,638
By the magazine rack.

311
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,809
The owner remembers seeing him
just before the last robbery.

312
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,480
Yeah, he doesn't look much
like a paying customer, does he?

313
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,193
- There's a car parked out in front.
- That's right, a no-parking zone.

314
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,112
Get over there by the door
with that shotgun.

315
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,781
Okay.

316
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,370
You think it'll be a hit or a miss?

317
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,708
Well, here's three salty-looking dudes.

318
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,557
Freeze, nigger!

319
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,061
- What you got there?
- Don't you go setting off no alarm.

320
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,897
You. Get over here, fast.

321
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,733
- You got a safe, nigger?
- No.

322
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,735
You lying sack of shit.

323
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,410
Just take it easy. Take it easy now.

324
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,412
Suck it.

325
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,582
Suck it.

326
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,793
I'll kill you. I said, suck it.

327
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,047
You go find that safe.

328
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,094
Right here is where I kill me a nigger.

329
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,472
Get on your knees.

330
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,517
Get on your knees.

331
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,107
- Better get out there now.
- Not yet.

332
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,943
Get on your knees.

333
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,759
Police!

334
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,053
Drop it!

335
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,516
All right, hold it!

336
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,151
I never shot a man.

337
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,156
Why don't you help the lady?

338
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,536
It's all right, ma'am.

339
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,439
You handled yourself real well tonight.

340
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,942
You work close. Man, you work close.

341
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,407
Hey, where are you guys off to?

342
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,369
- The Downtown Bowl on Eddy Street.
- Oh, yeah. See you later.

343
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,664
- You know them?
- They came from the academy after me.

344
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,624
They stick together like fly paper.

345
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,586
Everybody thought
they were queer for each other.

346
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,131
I'll tell you something,
if the rest of you could shoot like them...

347
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:06,218
...I wouldn't care
if the whole damn department was queer.

348
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,072
Excuse me, it's very important.

349
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,659
What do you think you're doing?

350
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,048
1000 O'Farrell.

351
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,949
We're not going to get there
unless you keep your eyes on the road.

352
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,202
Right on. 1000 O'Farrell.

353
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,118
Too bad you're not on welfare.

354
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,455
I'd give you a freebie.

355
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,587
Drive.

356
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,055
- Sidney, I was just on my way to see you.
- Where to?

357
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,350
- Just keep on going until I tell you to stop.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,394
Drop that flag.

359
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,815
- You're on your way to see me?
- Yes, Sidney, honest.

360
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,942
How come you didn't come by the crib?

361
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,777
- Well-
- Don't shit me.

362
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,196
I wouldn't do that.

363
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,908
- I've been waiting for you for one week.
- I've been working the convention.

364
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:38,245
- No telephones in that hotel?
- I've been working like hell, you know?

365
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,665
Let me show you.

366
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,087
- See? It's all here, all I got.
- All?

367
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,090
Looks like you've been
holding out on me.

368
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:54,011
No, I haven't. I've been straight
with you, Sidney. You know me.

369
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,098
Damn right I know you. Let's see
how much there is in the titty bank.

370
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,436
Hello, Mr. Green.

371
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,565
Check out the snatch bank too.

372
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,570
Damn right I know you.

373
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,782
I was gonna give it all to you,
but you didn't give me a chance.

374
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,451
Bitch, you had your chance.
I was your last chance.

375
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,704
Everybody else in town
threw your black ass out.

376
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,581
Help me!

377
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,070
Oh, God, no!

378
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,908
Good day, sir.
Is this car registered to you?

379
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,536
Yes, sir. This is my car.

380
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,373
You must be new. You know who I am?

381
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,209
I'll still have to see your license
and registration, sir.

382
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,171
I believe you were speeding
coming across the bridge.

383
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,482
Hi.

384
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,068
Hi.

385
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,736
What's your name?

386
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,112
Sunny.

387
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:09,910
I've been living here for six months now.
It's funny I've never met you before.

388
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,663
Well, I work a lot.

389
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,081
I know.

390
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,209
- You're the cop who lives upstairs.
- That's right.

391
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,378
Mind if I ask you a question?

392
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,088
No, go ahead.

393
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,216
What does a girl have to do
to go to bed with you?

394
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,766
Try knocking on the door.

395
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,642
- Hi.
- Hi.

396
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,354
Do you always live in the dark?

397
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:05,233
Well, you meet a better class of people
in the dark sometimes. Come on in.

398
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,697
Sit down.

399
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:23,377
- Yeah.
- Harry, this is Briggs. Are you alone?

400
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,088
No, actually,
I'm entertaining a young lady friend.

401
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:30,717
Put your pants back on, Callahan,
and come to the city morgue right away.

402
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,345
The morgue? What the hell for, Briggs?

403
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,390
I'm not on Homicide anymore.
I'm a stakeout man now, remember?

404
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,058
Not anymore, Callahan.

405
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,686
You and your partner
are back on Homicide.

406
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,939
This is a little dramatic, isn't it, Briggs?
Not your usual style.

407
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,691
It's meant to be, Callahan.

408
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,069
This thing might be bigger
than even we think it is.

409
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,280
Hijacking and gambling.

410
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,410
Trucking.

411
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,915
Narcotics and prostitution.

412
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,583
This is the cream in the bottle.

413
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,961
Someone wants
to put the courts out of business.

414
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,088
So far, you've said nothing wrong.

415
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,215
This one just came in an hour ago.

416
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,593
Somebody wants it all.
This guy was just a pimp.

417
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,262
That's one of his girls.

418
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,264
How did she get it?

419
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:22,728
Sometime before he got hit, he poured
a can of drain cleaner down her throat.

420
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,772
That shows a certain sense of style.

421
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,774
You're all heart, Callahan.

422
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,444
Am I gonna have to have him
leaning over my shoulder?

423
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,946
You work with Briggs on this, Callahan.

424
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:37,367
But if you ever lean out of line, so help
me, I'll flop you lower than whale shit.

425
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,287
Speaking of whale shit,
what have you turned up, Briggs?

426
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,706
Nobody in my department
is sitting on their ass.

427
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,791
See this thing, Callahan? The chief.

428
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,502
He calls me on this all the time.
Even in the can.

429
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,755
I haven't been out of my shoes
in 48 hours...

430
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,132
...and still we have
no witnesses, not one.

431
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,469
In these cases, there's always
an officer right on top of the crime.

432
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,637
But nobody's ever seen a thing.

433
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,808
- Who was the officer on this one?
- A patrolman, Sweet.

434
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,310
Wasn't it, Briggs?

435
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,562
Sweet seems like a good man.

436
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,607
I'll get on the ballistic reports
first thing in the morning.

437
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,985
We ran all the slugs through ballistics.
We'll never see those guns.

438
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,780
It was too professional,
you're wasting your time.

439
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,699
Well, it takes me time, Briggs.

440
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,913
A man has to know his limitations.

441
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,036
Warm enough?

442
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,253
You're my first cop.

443
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,051
Guess that'll be two firsts tonight,
won't it?

444
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,757
What do the others look like?

445
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,260
The gun was a. 357 Magnum.

446
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,513
The other bullets are all too deformed
to do us any good.

447
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,310
Hollow points, fired point-blank, you know.
We were lucky to get these two.

448
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,104
I found them in the pimp's car.

449
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,607
.357 Magnum?

450
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,236
Maybe it's a cop. Maybe it's Harry.

451
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,448
Nobody hates hoodlums
as much as he does.

452
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,870
Whoever it is, he enjoys it.

453
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,497
It's possible the man was dead
with the first shot.

454
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,875
The others were thrown in
just for good measure.

455
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,379
- He unloaded a whole magazine into him.
- One big mothering hole, huh?

456
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:41,343
Well, everybody has to pay something.

457
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,972
He would have to be standing right here,
this close...

458
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,266
...point-blank range.

459
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,564
The driver's license
and the $100 bill were out.

460
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,484
Almost like he was showing it
to a traffic cop.

461
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,944
Yeah.

462
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:03,823
From what we have, it figures somebody
to be impersonating a police officer.

463
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,244
On the cars, at least.
It's been done before.

464
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:11,831
This close, it would have to be
somebody he would never recognize.

465
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,542
Or never suspect.

466
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:22,342
Lou Guzman, ex-meat lugger
with a first-grade education.

467
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,972
He started working for the old boss
of bosses as a hitter.

468
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:31,601
He controls narcotics state-wide,
and now dabbles in prostitution...

469
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,355
...has big friends everywhere.
I want Casale and DiGiorgio on him.

470
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,148
Next. Thank you.

471
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,653
This one is for your special talents,
Callahan.

472
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,030
Frank Palancio.

473
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,908
Two hundred and twelve pounds.

474
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:51,413
Indicted for murder 23 times,
no convictions.

475
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,708
Complains about his health now.

476
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:59,629
Suffers from ulcers, migraine headaches.
Dangerously violent.

477
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,799
At one point,
he was Ricca's principle assassin.

478
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,385
If you mix it with him, he won't back off.

479
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,429
He's all yours, Callahan.

480
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,348
That's very nice, lieutenant,
but I don't think Palancio-

481
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,100
I want you on him, Callahan.

482
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,937
I'd bust Palancio for stepping
on a crack on the sidewalk if I could...

483
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,941
...but this isn't his style.
Not the cars anyway, it's too direct.

484
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:23,445
Callahan, you just keep your nose
pressed against Palancio's ass...

485
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,948
...until I get a warrant
from the DA's office to bring him in.

486
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,242
And I want the first conviction
on this animal.

487
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,370
Conviction?
He's liable to be your next victim.

488
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,789
What are you asking for, lieutenant?

489
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:40,086
I'm not asking you to follow him, inspector.
For the last goddamn time, I'm telling you.

490
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,421
Next.

491
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:47,469
Nick Royale, Palancio's number-one hitter.

492
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,554
He's had good training.

493
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,163
What's happening?

494
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,500
Nothing, just a lot of peeping and checking,
checking and peeping.

495
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,795
I knew an old boy once
who used to keep pigs under his bed.

496
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,671
Pigs? The eating kind?

497
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:28,009
The eating kind.
Is all you ever think of your stomach?

498
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,476
That's very interesting,
but I think we better get going.

499
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,936
Yeah.

500
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,688
- They're splitting up. Which one, Harry?
- We'll stay with these two.

501
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,067
Across the bridge,
it's out of our jurisdiction.

502
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,486
Yeah.

503
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,741
Well?

504
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,868
Stick with the money.

505
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,059
Pull over and stop.

506
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,161
What are you trying to do?
He doesn't even know we're cops.

507
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,791
He may panic, and besides,
we don't belong over here anyway.

508
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,543
I hope he does panic.

509
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,964
Then I'll get him for 23 other murders.

510
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,299
And if he doesn't...

511
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,636
...then I may be right about something
that's been nagging at me.

512
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,805
I sure hope I'm not.

513
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,682
What?

514
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,309
I don't wanna be winning bets
for anybody.

515
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,325
Go a little faster, I'm on their side.

516
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,912
- Roll down your window.
- What? Are you out of your mind?

517
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,332
- I've never been wrong yet, have I?
- I don't know why I'm doing this.

518
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:50,503
- Say, excuse me. Could you help us out?
- What do you want?

519
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,089
Maybe you could help us,
we seem to be lost.

520
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,718
We were looking for the entrance
to San Quentin. You know where that is?

521
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,928
It's back there. Don't you see too good?

522
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,099
Yeah, I see fine. I just wanted to know
whether you knew where San Quentin was.

523
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:06,227
And you do, don't you, asshole?

524
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,528
Get you yet, you son of a bitch.

525
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,035
You always gotta do things your way,
don't you?

526
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,537
No wonder Briggs stays on your tail.

527
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:31,044
You do things someone else's way
and you take your life in your own hands.

528
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,232
That son of a bitch Guzman.

529
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,362
He hasn't gone out for almost
24 hours now.

530
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,223
Hey, one of our guys took a spill.

531
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,520
It's Charlie McCoy. Seems to be okay.

532
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,438
Let me take a look.

533
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,566
Yeah, he's okay.

534
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,662
There he is.

535
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:52,667
So all you've got to do
is sit around all day, Guzman?

536
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,325
This coke is out of sight.

537
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,953
Oh, Guzman is the man, baby.

538
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,206
Oh, you bitch. Don't spill it.

539
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,959
That stuff's worth $900 an ounce.

540
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,836
You better not spill it.

541
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,839
Don't get so uptight.

542
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:44,135
Nobody says "don't" to me.
You understand? Nobody.

543
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,347
I never touch the stuff.

544
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,058
You wanna put that over there now?

545
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,795
Take over for me, will you, Ed?

546
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,115
Damn, I wish something would happen.

547
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,784
Take it easy.

548
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,246
That's what stakeouts are all about.
Waiting.

549
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:10,114
It's a cop. Oh, no!

550
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:13,159
No! No! No, please! No!

551
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,459
Frank!

552
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:33,322
- Just what the hell is going on?
- Somebody killed a cop.

553
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,450
Folks, there's been a little trouble here.
Everyone stand back.

554
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,494
Please, ma'am, move back.

555
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,290
There's been some trouble.

556
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,626
What happened?

557
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,088
Everything seems to be all right, folks.

558
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,132
What's going on?

559
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,593
Move it, people.

560
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,430
Please, sir, stand back.

561
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,223
Yes, sir.

562
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,601
Yes, sir.

563
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,271
No, sir. We won't let anything
out to the press.

564
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:07,940
Yes, sir.

565
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,153
You endangered an entire investigation
by trying to push something.

566
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,155
Not to mention your own lives.

567
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,282
You blew the whole Palancio stakeout.

568
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,326
Instead of keeping him under surveillance
as I told you to...

569
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:22,872
...you had to harass him.
What do you have to say about that?

570
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,582
What do I tell Avery? What?

571
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:31,505
You tell him it's not Palancio.
You tell him it's a traffic cop.

572
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,634
- A cop?
- That's right.

573
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:38,137
A traffic cop. Are you out of your mind?

574
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,475
Do you expect me to believe
that a traffic cop...

575
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:46,187
...is killing off all the top criminals
in the city? Who?

576
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,318
It's Charlie McCoy.

577
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,697
He's ready for the rubber gun squad.
He even tried to kill himself.

578
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,283
Charlie McCoy.

579
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,952
Harry...

580
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,997
...Guzman was hit today.

581
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,543
A cop was killed. It was Charlie McCoy.

582
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,675
- McCoy?
- Yes, Charlie McCoy.

583
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,845
The only reason I don't bust you
into the bag this minute...

584
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,140
...is I know the two of you
were close friends.

585
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:26,936
I was just about to call his wife.
Or you can, if you want to.

586
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,313
I know he had kids.

587
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,023
Yeah.

588
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,443
- Who reported it?
- Davis.

589
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,653
Davis?

590
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,531
What happened
to the DiGiorgio stakeout team?

591
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:42,493
It was an accidental coincidence.
Davis happened to be going by, it happens.

592
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,745
McCoy was already dead
when he got there.

593
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,499
- Any witnesses?
- None.

594
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,129
- I'll make that call.
- Go ahead.

595
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:57,842
Harry, if it means anything coming
from me, I'm sorry about Charlie.

596
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,219
But it's Palancio, believe me.

597
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:03,931
I'll have a warrant in 48 hours.
You can pick him up.

598
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,516
He's all yours.

599
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,095
Well, thank you for coming, Harry.

600
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,764
You sure you have to leave?

601
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:50,311
I won't have any place to go
for a sit-down dinner anymore.

602
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:54,148
I never really did like it here very much.

603
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,943
I always liked the change of seasons.

604
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:07,912
I'm gonna take him home. It's time.

605
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:11,040
It's time he went home.

606
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,631
Come on, kids, let's get in the car.

607
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:31,852
It was nice of that young man
to help us with the children.

608
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:37,691
Goodbye, Harry. We'll all miss you.

609
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:39,360
Bye, doll.

610
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,827
Take them
to the passenger terminal, please.

611
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:02,049
It was nice of you to come out.
You didn't have to do that.

612
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,344
If I'd have been there sooner,
he might still be alive.

613
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:09,515
He didn't deserve to get it that way.

614
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,685
If there's anything I can do...

615
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,605
I feel responsible somehow.

616
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:47,720
The next shooter is Callahan.
Davis on deck.

617
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:32,806
You sure shot the pants off
of everybody with that score, Harry.

618
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,850
I've never seen you smoother.

619
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,936
By the way,
I personally want to tell you...

620
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:41,190
...how sorry I am
about what happened to Charlie.

621
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:46,153
What I can't figure out, Frank,
is how that kid Davis got in there first.

622
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,614
You guys were right across the street.

623
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:53,619
I don't have a goddamned idea, Harry.
The kid came out of nowhere.

624
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:57,122
We were in that garage
before you could spit.

625
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,959
Maybe I'm slowing down in my old age
or something, I don't know.

626
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:05,631
I wanna be the first to congratulate you
on what I think will be the winning score.

627
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,633
You shaded me by seven points.

628
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,886
The only person now
who has a chance is Davis.

629
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,976
Shoot them up.

630
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,181
I think the kid beat you, Harry.

631
01:13:57,724 --> 01:13:59,101
It happens.

632
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,146
Harry, he edged you by four points.

633
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,898
That evens it up on the overall champion.

634
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:07,651
You have your choice in the shoot-off.

635
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,154
Bull's eye or combat?

636
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,992
Combat.

637
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,371
Out!

638
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:12,132
Five, 46 seconds. Score, perfect.

639
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:14,635
Good luck, sir.

640
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,511
A good guy!
That last one was a good guy.

641
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,902
Thirty-six seconds.
But I'm sorry, Harry, you hit a good guy.

642
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,196
You had a bad break.
I really don't deserve it.

643
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,698
Well, you won, didn't you?

644
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:19,825
- Yes, sir, but-
- That's all that matters.

645
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,493
You mind if I try that one?

646
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,668
Chester, how about six?

647
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,856
Not bad. I seem to have lost the last one.

648
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,026
You get used to it.

649
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:59,031
I can see how you would, at that.

650
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,423
You said five minutes
and I've been waiting for half an hour.

651
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,717
Don't you ever get hungry?

652
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:07,599
- It just didn't seem like a half-hour.
- Yeah, well, it has been.

653
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,894
I went over to my butcher's yesterday
and picked up some veal.

654
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:15,399
Pops is really an artist, man. I could
watch that man cut meat all day long.

655
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,777
Why don't you
come home with me and...

656
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,780
My wife's a good cook.
Have a little dinner with us.

657
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,957
No, thanks. I just saw something
that killed my appetite.

658
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:44,219
We'll catch those animals with their pants
down. I was going to call you at home.

659
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,847
We got our search warrants
and multiple charges.

660
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:49,599
We're gonna make a city-wide raid
tomorrow morning.

661
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:54,020
Palancio is yours.
Just don't take him out head-first, Harry.

662
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:58,316
I think you'll find what I want to show you
in ballistics very interesting.

663
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:01,862
You'll find more leads than you can
shake a stick at tomorrow morning.

664
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,535
- Good morning, Harry. Sir.
- Walter.

665
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,871
Do you mind excusing us
for a few minutes?

666
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:12,581
Sure.

667
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:22,549
There's only two.

668
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:26,344
- I wonder what happened to the others.
- Federal boys have them.

669
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,493
Well?

670
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,204
Take a look.

671
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,543
Close, real close.

672
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:02,714
But there's still a lot of lines
that don't match up.

673
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,091
All this proves is that these two bullets...

674
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:08,762
...came from barrels
with a similar twist and width of rifling.

675
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,097
You don't think it would stand up
as evidence?

676
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:12,808
As it is, no.

677
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,769
But I'll have a full comparison report made,
no problem.

678
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:19,272
You're probably right.
Besides, it isn't necessary yet.

679
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:21,274
What do you mean, "yet"?

680
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:23,026
Where'd you get that slug?

681
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:26,905
- I'd just as soon not say for the time being.
- Don't play games on this.

682
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,532
Whose side are you on anyway?

683
01:20:28,698 --> 01:20:31,535
It's just a wild shot
and I'm probably wrong.

684
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:34,246
I'd like to handle it my own way.

685
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:38,667
By the way, I'd like to have Davis
and Sweet as my back-up squad tomorrow.

686
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,003
Davis and Sweet?
They're just rookies, for chrissake.

687
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,549
You drum up somebody in the department
who can shoot as well and I'll use them.

688
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:48,218
Goddamn it,
there isn't supposed to be any shooting.

689
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:52,222
Besides, they don't have the experience yet
for a job like this.

690
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,226
How the hell's a man supposed to get
experience if nobody gives him a chance?

691
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:58,395
And Davis is the new pistol champion.

692
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,189
Suppose they panic and start shooting?

693
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:07,946
Nothing wrong with shooting,
as long as the right people get shot.

694
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:27,924
- Let him know who you are and keep cool.
- Okay.

695
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:30,594
I want you to keep an eye
on Davis and Sweet.

696
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,803
What for?

697
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,847
Just do it, will you?

698
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:36,641
All right.

699
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,685
- You all set?
- All set.

700
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,478
We'll take off in three cars.

701
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:43,189
Davis and Sweet will make the arrest.
Early will cover.

702
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,568
I'll be on the back at the pier
in case anybody makes a break for it.

703
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,154
If there'll be trouble,
that's where it'll start.

704
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,449
We're holding the other squads back
until you've made your arrest.

705
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:56,912
Yours is the most important, it'll be
the first. We don't want any foul-ups.

706
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,663
- Right?
- Right.

707
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:04,002
I'd never walk up to a door with Harry,
too many people don't like him.

708
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:07,964
Thanks. I needed that.

709
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,135
- You boys ready?
- Yes, sir.

710
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,430
- Thank you for requesting us.
- Sir, we won't let you down.

711
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,807
Well, I'm depending on that.

712
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:25,959
Yeah?

713
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,089
Who is this?

714
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:39,681
What was that, Nickie?

715
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:46,896
Somebody said we'll be hit in two minutes.
They'll be dressed like cops.

716
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:50,191
Did it sound like anybody you know?

717
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,777
No, I couldn't tell.

718
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,794
Ed, Chuck...

719
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:14,507
...get over to the windows.

720
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:19,512
I got the water side.

721
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,806
I'll take the street side.

722
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:24,059
If they are cops, this could be a set-up.

723
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:27,145
After the holes they put in Ricca
you want me to wait and see?

724
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,189
If they're cops, they'll have papers.

725
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:31,191
Car coming, Frank.

726
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:33,985
There's a big guy out there.

727
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,991
- He got a uniform on?
- No.

728
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:44,204
He ain't no cop.
Cops always come in the front door.

729
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:46,206
Another car.

730
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:49,417
Why didn't they come in squad cars
if they're cops?

731
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:53,421
That big guy's working himself around
by those containers.

732
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,466
He's got a gun out.

733
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,009
Two uniforms in it.

734
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,679
That ain't no cop's gun, Frank.

735
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:09,979
There's a cop in uniform coming up
to the door.

736
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,446
We ain't open. Come back tomorrow.

737
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,199
Police officers,
we'd like to ask you some questions.

738
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:24,035
I'm just a watchman. Nobody's here.

739
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,995
We're looking for Mr. Frank Palancio.

740
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:28,832
Would you open the door?
We have a warrant for his arrest.

741
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:30,542
I said nobody's here, goddamn it!

742
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,044
We have warrants
for a search of the premises.

743
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:34,921
Serve them!

744
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:52,063
They got Sweet! Send some help, quick!

745
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:40,987
Cease firing.

746
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:44,616
Throw your weapons out and come out
with your hands behind your heads.

747
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:46,868
- Bullshit!
- Fuck you!

748
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:50,074
You sure you don't want a local for this?
Takes about seven stitches.

749
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:51,784
No, thanks.

750
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:55,413
Okay, it's your ass.

751
01:28:55,955 --> 01:28:58,666
My head, cut's on my head.

752
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,920
Why does everybody suddenly
become a comedian in here?

753
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,089
Does he have to stay in here?

754
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:10,428
No, I could stop and let the man's
brains run out all over his shoes.

755
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,973
Rogers, I don't need to have a doctor
display that kind of attitude.

756
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,933
A police officer is dead.

757
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,353
Sorry.

758
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,565
I got those warrants
for a search of the premises, Callahan...

759
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:25,610
...not for you to become
judge, jury and executioner.

760
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:28,404
It was supposed to be a simple arrest.

761
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:32,617
Arresting a killer like Palancio
isn't always simple.

762
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:35,745
People are guilty until proven-
I mean...

763
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:38,790
Goddamn it, you know what I mean.

764
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:41,959
The city's on the edge
of the worst violence in its history...

765
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:44,921
...and you have to start
full-scale military operations.

766
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:48,466
I didn't start shooting at anyone
who didn't start shooting at me first.

767
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:52,970
Each time you pull out that gun,
my paperwork backs up for three months.

768
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,807
The chief and I have already
conferred on this matter.

769
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,184
A full investigation is warranted here.

770
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:05,483
What about a dead cop?

771
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:09,654
- I warned you against taking them.
- Sweet was killed with the first shot.

772
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:14,450
Besides, they were tipped off.
They knew we were coming, Briggs.

773
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:17,453
How? Don't hand me that crap.

774
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:20,832
They knew we were coming.
After 200 arrests, I know the difference.

775
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:26,504
If I have my way, Callahan, you won't make
another arrest as long as you live.

776
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,216
Is that all, lieutenant?

777
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:33,636
No, that's not all.

778
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:36,305
I want that slug you showed me.

779
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:42,228
I ran that through ballistics, it was
nothing. The rifling was totally different.

780
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:45,022
It's still state's evidence.
I want it anyway.

781
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:51,737
Eat it.

782
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:18,181
Look, Harry, if it means anything,
I think you got the wrong end of the stick.

783
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:20,057
- You do?
- Yeah.

784
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:22,393
What did they find
when they got in there?

785
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,980
Nothing. Palancio was as clean
as he could possibly be.

786
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,774
They knew we were coming, Harry.

787
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:31,277
Why do you figure they opened up on us?

788
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,697
They must've thought
it was a set-up like the others.

789
01:31:35,072 --> 01:31:37,074
- It was.
- No.

790
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:40,077
It was a set-up, Early.

791
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:46,375
What I'm gonna lay on you seems so
far-fetched, I can't even believe it myself.

792
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:50,338
I gave up being surprised
working with you anyway.

793
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:53,466
Would you be surprised if I told you...

794
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:57,595
...a bunch of rookie cops were the ones
who were doing all the killing?

795
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:00,223
See this?

796
01:32:00,389 --> 01:32:03,309
I gave Briggs a phony for the time being.

797
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:05,811
This is a bullet I took out
of the target range.

798
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:07,939
It came from Davis' gun.

799
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:11,442
It matches up with the one
taken out of Charlie McCoy's body.

800
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:14,195
Davis? That's insane.

801
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,823
Maybe so, but somebody tipped-off
Palancio that we were coming.

802
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:22,245
Wanting me killed or Palancio
or hopefully both.

803
01:32:22,411 --> 01:32:25,957
Yeah, but Sweet died today.

804
01:32:26,123 --> 01:32:28,709
Sweet was sacrificed.

805
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,505
What's more important, if I'm right,
I'll be sacrificed.

806
01:32:32,672 --> 01:32:36,259
They've gotta figure I told you,
which means you'll be sacrificed.

807
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,137
Yeah.

808
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:45,643
If anything happens to me,
I want you to give that to Lt. Briggs.

809
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,771
Okay. What happens
if they get us both?

810
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,315
Then they win.

811
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,196
It's not hard to understand
how this could happen, the way things are.

812
01:32:57,363 --> 01:33:01,284
As incredible as it seems, there may be
a sub-organization within the police force.

813
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:05,162
Sort of a death squad
like they had in Brazil some years back.

814
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,957
Damn.

815
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:14,338
Some nights I wake up, wonder
where the hell the world's going to.

816
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,469
I want you to take care of yourself,
you understand?

817
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:54,795
- Hi.
- Hi.

818
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:57,548
Jesus, what happened to your face?

819
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,592
Nothing, just a few stitches.

820
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:05,389
I was going to the market,
how about if I bring back a few beers?

821
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:07,850
Good, I could use a beer right about now.

822
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,227
I've got your key,
so I'll get your mail too.

823
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:11,771
All right, baby.

824
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:14,065
Keep it warm.

825
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:42,551
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to prosecute a cop?

826
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:03,280
You heroes have killed
a dozen people this week.

827
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,826
What are you gonna do next week?

828
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:10,913
Kill a dozen more.

829
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:14,959
Is that what you guys are all about,
being heroes?

830
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,086
All our heroes are dead.

831
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:18,921
We are the first generation...

832
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:21,549
...that's learned to fight.

833
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,885
We're simply ridding society
of killers that would be caught...

834
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:27,930
...and sentenced anyway
if our courts worked properly.

835
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:33,811
We began with the criminals
that the people know...

836
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:37,314
...so that our actions
would be understood.

837
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:42,236
It's not just a question
of whether or not to use violence.

838
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:46,323
There simply is no other way, inspector.

839
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,744
You of all people...

840
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:52,163
...should understand that.

841
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,835
Either you're for us or you're against us.

842
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,385
I'm afraid you've misjudged me.

843
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:11,594
- Hi, Sunny.
- Hi, Sue.

844
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:19,101
No, no!

845
01:38:20,477 --> 01:38:23,397
Harry, what are you doing?

846
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,947
Hey, what's going on down here?

847
01:38:32,114 --> 01:38:34,700
I'm taking the mailbox apart,
what does it look like?

848
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,202
- You people live here, don't you?
- Yeah.

849
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:41,040
What are you doing to the mailbox?
Did you lose you key?

850
01:38:41,206 --> 01:38:44,251
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business?

851
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:47,671
That's my mailbox too.
Don't you get smart with me.

852
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:51,175
Tampering with the mail
is a federal offense.

853
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,177
I'm calling the police.

854
01:38:54,136 --> 01:38:55,346
I am the police.

855
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:57,848
What?

856
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,685
The cop that lives upstairs?

857
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,872
What's that?

858
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,084
Plastic explosive.

859
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:28,212
A bomb?

860
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:29,880
That's right.

861
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:33,092
If you'd bothered me any more,
we'd all be stuck to the ceiling.

862
01:39:33,258 --> 01:39:36,887
- Do you want to hold it?
- No. I don't want to get involved.

863
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,351
Go to your apartment and stay there.
Don't open for anybody.

864
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:02,973
Damn it.

865
01:41:12,524 --> 01:41:13,734
Operator.

866
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:17,321
Homicide, Lt. Briggs,
Inspector Callahan calling.

867
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:22,409
Callahan, where are you?

868
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:24,870
Look, Briggs,
I just found a bomb in my mailbox.

869
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,956
I want you to get a man
over to Early's house right away.

870
01:41:28,123 --> 01:41:31,168
- What?
- I've got a bomb right here.

871
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:33,337
Now get a man over to Early's,
you hear me?

872
01:41:34,046 --> 01:41:35,672
Right.

873
01:41:35,839 --> 01:41:38,467
Stay right where you are.
I'll be down there myself.

874
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:40,260
Don't move.

875
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,221
Yeah?

876
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:34,565
Come on in.

877
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:39,736
I don't like looking down one of those.

878
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:44,074
Where's the bomb?

879
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,577
Right on the dresser.

880
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:52,916
All right. Let's get out of here.

881
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:55,669
Avery will want to see this.

882
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:10,142
You mind driving?
I want to take a closer look at this thing.

883
01:43:31,955 --> 01:43:34,791
This thing could be activated
by your mailbox key.

884
01:43:36,126 --> 01:43:37,920
Or by a timer.

885
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:42,966
Turn right, here.

886
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:49,514
Get on the freeway.

887
01:43:49,681 --> 01:43:51,600
The freeway?

888
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:55,020
You got a new route to city hall,
lieutenant?

889
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:06,448
Your gun's out of its holster, Briggs.
First time?

890
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:08,617
You know you're not going to city hall.

891
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:11,828
The only way you're going anywhere
is in a rubber bag.

892
01:44:12,537 --> 01:44:14,331
Let me have your gun.

893
01:44:33,725 --> 01:44:35,018
Now the shells.

894
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:42,025
Three. You always carry three.

895
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:49,074
Throw them out the window.

896
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:57,749
How do you figure on pulling this off,
Briggs?

897
01:44:57,916 --> 01:45:01,586
I run the investigation. With your record,
I can make anything stick.

898
01:45:02,879 --> 01:45:05,507
What I can't understand is,
why you of all people?

899
01:45:05,674 --> 01:45:08,593
A hundred years ago in this city,
people did the same thing.

900
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,722
History justified the vigilantes,
we're no different.

901
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:15,726
Anyone who threatens the security
of the people will be executed.

902
01:45:16,226 --> 01:45:21,064
- Evil for evil, Harry. Retribution.
- That's just fine.

903
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:23,650
But how does murder fit in?

904
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:26,445
When police start becoming
their own executioners...

905
01:45:26,611 --> 01:45:29,114
...where's it gonna end, Briggs?

906
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:32,284
Pretty soon, you'll start executing people
for jaywalking.

907
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:35,245
And executing people for traffic violations.

908
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:39,416
Then you end up executing your neighbor
because his dog pisses on your lawn.

909
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:43,628
There isn't one man we've killed that
didn't deserve what was coming to him.

910
01:45:43,795 --> 01:45:46,548
Yes, there is. Charlie McCoy.

911
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:49,593
- What would you have done?
- I'd have upheld the law.

912
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,970
What the hell do you know
about the law?

913
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:53,930
You're a great cop, Harry.

914
01:45:54,097 --> 01:45:57,642
You had a chance to join the team,
but you'd rather stick to the system.

915
01:45:57,809 --> 01:46:01,146
Briggs, I hate the goddamn system.
But until someone comes along...

916
01:46:01,313 --> 01:46:04,441
...with some changes that make sense,
I'll stick with it.

917
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:07,319
You're about to become extinct.

918
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,116
Get off at the next exit.

919
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:19,787
Red?

920
01:55:49,859 --> 01:55:51,569
Red?

921
01:58:10,416 --> 01:58:14,295
Briggs was right.
You guys don't have enough experience.

922
01:58:55,044 --> 01:58:57,505
Just hold it right there, Callahan.

923
01:58:59,048 --> 01:59:00,216
No tricks.

924
01:59:12,061 --> 01:59:14,105
Your organization's through, Briggs.

925
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:18,359
There's a lot more where they came from,
believe me.

926
01:59:18,526 --> 01:59:21,904
Move out of the way. Move it!

927
01:59:49,765 --> 01:59:51,100
Uphold the law.

928
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:57,106
You just killed three
police officers, Harry.

929
02:00:01,152 --> 02:00:04,071
And the only reason
I'm not gonna kill you...

930
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:07,325
...is because I'm gonna prosecute you
