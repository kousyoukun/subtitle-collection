1
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:07,984
Grover, what do you mean coming in here
after me when I'm with my friends?

2
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:12,242
Get outta here. You'll get your supplies
tomorrow like everybody else.

3
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:16,413
- It ain't that. I brought you something.
- Yeah? What?

4
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:19,493
A piece of tail,
cos I owe you a favour, you dig?

5
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:23,789
A piece of what? Man,
what you talking about? Look over there.

6
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:28,963
I got plenty of tail. I got more tail
than I can handle. I even got white tail.

7
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:33,008
And you telling me you brought me
something. What you been shootin'?

8
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,971
It ain't that. This is something special.
This broad is strung out.

9
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:40,517
Says she'll do anything
to get straight, man. Anything.

10
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:42,888
Then she's yours. You fix her.

11
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:45,230
Come on, man. Don't be like that.

12
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,816
If I say she's somethin' special,
she's somethin' special, man.

13
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:54,151
At least you can look at her.
She's sittin' in your car.

14
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:59,492
In my car? You mean you've got
some strung-out broad in my car?

15
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:02,293
Man, I'm gonna kick your ass.

16
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,334
All right, baby. Everybody out.

17
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:19,555
- You say she'll do anything?
- That's what she said, man.

18
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:22,935
Ain't she somethin'? Too much for me.

19
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:25,519
Get in. You drive.

20
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:33,776
Honey, you're with friends at last.

21
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:36,481
We're gonna straighten you out for sure.

22
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,619
You know just the words that turn me on.

23
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:42,866
And I know what you want, too,
and you're gonna get it.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,573
Let's go to your place.
You can have the leftovers.

25
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:48,036
No, man, I just wanna get high and watch.

26
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,800
Hey, ain't one man
big enough for you, honey?

27
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:05,347
Do I look like the kind of girl
one man would be enough for?

28
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,273
- One big man.
- One big dealin' man, maybe.

29
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:13,985
You are that big dealin' man
I been hearin' about, ain't you?

30
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:16,569
Yeah, maybe. Big enough.

31
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:26,958
- When you gonna give me some?
- In a little bit. We're almost there.

32
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:31,671
Anything you want, big man.

33
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:33,874
Jesus.

34
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:52,605
<i># Coffy is the colour</i>

35
00:03:57,448 --> 00:03:59,904

36
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:07,790

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,016

00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:40,782

51
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:47,097
Son of a bitch.
You really is a big man, aren't you?

52
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:49,549
Yeah.

53
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,724
Wait.

54
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:57,475
You better give it to me first.

55
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:02,022
Dammit, what the hell are you doing
in there? Making a goddamn soufflé?

56
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,397
Just a minute, Sugarman.

57
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,202
First things first, you dig?

58
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,037
Hey, big man.
Why don't you turn out the lights?

59
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:30,930
This is the end of your rotten life,
you motherfuckin' dope pusher.

60
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:49,695
It was easy for him because
he really didn't believe it was comin'.

61
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:53,611
But it ain't gonna be easy for you.
You better believe it's comin'.

62
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,575
Wait. Wait.

63
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:59,159
What do you wanna go
and do this for? Why?

64
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:02,212
Look here. I got your fix.
Don't you want your fix?

65
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,795
No. But you do.

66
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,300
I don't get this.
What do you want with me?

67
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,428
My name's Coffin.
LuBelle Coffin is my little sister.

68
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,306
LuBelle?

69
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:17,970
Shootin' smack at 11,
and you got her on it!

70
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,264
Please! Please!

71
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,100
Her whole life is gone.
She can never get it back.

72
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:27,356
And you're livin' real good. That ain't right.

73
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:32,198
- It ain't right, so go on and take the shot.
- I can't. That'd kill me.

74
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:36,954
Maybe it will, maybe it won't. But if it do,
you're gonna fly through the Pearly Gates

75
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,368
with the biggest fuckin' smile
St Peter's ever seen.

76
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,417
I don't even remember
your little sister. No!

77
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,847
- I can't do it, Doctor.
- Christ, now what?

78
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,012
It's her first time in emergency.

79
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,715
Get somebody in here
who can handle this job.

80
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,850
Where's Coffin? Get Coffin in here.

81
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,896
- Sorry I'm late, Doctor.
- Where the hell have you been?

82
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:11,947
Car broke down on the freeway. Just
shook me up a little bit. I'll be all right.

83
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,317
Jesus, what's happening here tonight?

84
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,288
This place is turning
into a fuckin' insane asylum.

85
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:22,788
Coffy, get your ass outta here, and don't
come back until you're good and ready.

86
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,589
- Now move!
- Yes, Doctor.

87
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,504
All right, let's go. We don't have all day.

88
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:38,220
Hi, Doctor.
Another fun-filled Saturday night.

89
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,349
- What can I do for you, McHenry?
- This is my new partner, Carter Brown.

90
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,351
- Carter, Dr Brannan.
- How are you, Doctor?

91
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,061
Hello, young man.

92
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,855
Sergeant said you want information on
that junkie OD case we turned up tonight.

93
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,402
Right. Come over to the desk for a minute.
I don't think he's gonna come out of it,

94
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:01,494
because he apparently shot something
else besides heroin. Clipboard, please.

95
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,076
I'd like to know if you found
any other drugs around the scene.

96
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,580
I'd like to know what to treat him for
until we get the analysis.

97
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,881
No, sorry.
He'll have flushed it down the toilet.

98
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,417
Hey, Coffy.

99
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,593
Hey, baby.

100
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,262
Carter.

101
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,143
What's the matter? Somethin' wrong?

102
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,137
No, I'm just a little tired tonight
for some reason.

103
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,350
What are you doin' here?

104
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:33,479
The only cop I know to get a dislocated
toe, run over by his own squad car,

105
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,485
while writing a ticket
cos he didn't set the handbrake.

106
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:42,738
- Come on. Don't tell stories like that.
- I had to hold your hand while they set it.

107
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,447
- You want some?
- Yeah, black, please.

108
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,337
Boy, we had a real messy one tonight.

109
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,464
A junkie killed his connection
with a shotgun.

110
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:56,755
Blew his head clean off,
then OD'd himself.

111
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,221
Yeah? Kind of strange, isn't it?

112
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,800
At least, that's what my partner says.
I don't believe it.

113
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,050
You don't?

114
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,770
There's a mob been takin' over
the vice and narcotics rackets.

115
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,975
Even tryin' to pay off the police.

116
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,977
You're really beginning to sound
like a cop now, you know it?

117
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,364
I got a busy night, Carter. I gotta go.

118
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,537
Wait a minute. I still wanna see you.
Can't we get together this week?

119
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,159
Come on, Carter. I've told you how it is.
Things haven't changed any.

120
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:30,542
I can't believe you're still hung up
on that phoney politician.

121
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,834
You're not gonna get to me
by insulting my friends.

122
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:40,091
Just give it a chance. Somethin' innocent,
like a movie or a drive in the country.

123
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,713
What are you doin' tomorrow?

124
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:45,305
You won't wanna do
what I'm doin' tomorrow.

125
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:49,018
Yes, I will. Try me.

126
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,570
Some of the kids were on all kinds of pills.

127
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:08,457
Some are on methadone now.

128
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,450
The youngest is only nine years old.

129
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:15,956
The worst are the ones
that got the contaminated junk.

130
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:21,215
But you know dealin' junkies. They'll put
anything into it to stretch a dollar out of it.

131
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:27,218
Time to sit up again, LuBelle.
Your sister's come to see you again.

132
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,391
Flower-child.

133
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,270
Hello, LuBelle. Remember me?

134
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,857
Do you remember Carter?

135
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:43,073
I brought you your favourite candy.

136
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:49,279
How do you feel today?
Do you feel better? Good.

137
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:53,283
You look a lot better.
Who combed your hair?

138
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:58,497
When I got my certificate I moved up here

139
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:01,587
so I could make more bread
to send some home to LuBelle,

140
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,471
paying for music lessons
and dance classes,

141
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:07,432
so she wouldn't end up hustlin'
like my older sister.

142
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:14,225
But when you got a sister hustlin' and
a brother snortin' coke and shootin' up...

143
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:16,645
Then I found out about a month ago,

144
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:21,852
for the past year
all the money's been goin' for junk.

145
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:24,562
Pills first, then smack.

146
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,487
I told her to stay away from those people.

147
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,824
But some junkie knew she was gettin'
money and he started leanin' on her.

148
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:37,208
Carter...

149
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:44,175
Wouldn't you wanna kill somebody who'd
done a thing like that to your little sister?

150
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:47,304
- I sure would.
- Then you think it'd be right?

151
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:53,932
What? To kill some pusher who's only
sellin' to get money to buy for himself?

152
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:57,396
What good would that do, Coffy?
He's only a part of a chain

153
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:02,352
that reaches all the way back to
some poor farmer in Turkey or Vietnam.

154
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:05,157
- What would you do? Kill all of 'em?
- Why not?

155
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,737
Nothing else seems to do any good.

156
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:11,201
You know who they are.
Everybody knows who they are.

157
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,414
You're a cop.
Why don't you just arrest them?

158
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,827
It's not that simple, Coffy.
The law can't do that.

159
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:21,377
You bet it can't.
And I know why it can't too.

160
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:25,421
Because the law
is in for a piece of the action.

161
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,293
Not all of us.

162
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:31,470
Not yet.

163
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:46,188
Now, look who's here. It's pretty hard
for an ordinary cop to compete with.

164
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:50,700
Carter, you've been real nice up to now.
Don't spoil it.

165
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:55,323
But we had a real good thing together
once. I think there's still somethin' there.

166
00:13:55,456 --> 00:14:00,284
But we were kids then.
Things are different now.

167
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,002
- Good night, Carter.
- Good night, Coffy.

168
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:15,967
- George, you're here early.
- Good evening, Miss Coffin.

169
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:20,431
Mr Brunswick said he'd be finished with
business early so you can come sooner.

170
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:25,772
OK, but give me a few minutes to change.
I'll be right back.

171
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,178
Howard, I think your interest in this place

172
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:02,648
goes a little beyond just sticking your
nose into those books once in a while.

173
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:06,818
Ruben, you know I never
mix business with pleasure.

174
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:10,028
Except in a ratio of three to one.

175
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:15,150
When I was a cop on the East Side I had
the same ratio, only the other way around.

176
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,955
I didn't say how I mixed 'em.

177
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,250
Here comes my best business now.

178
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,257
- Thanks, Floyd,
- Yes, sir.

179
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:31,126
Hello, baby.

180
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,378
Ruben, this is Ms Coffin.

181
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:38,431
Coffy, this is Ruben Ramos,
our deputy commissioner.

182
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:42,342
- Commissioner of what?
- Apple stealers, flatfoots.

183
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:45,978
He's the heat, baby,
so don't pull out any pills or joints.

184
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:51,350
Really? The fuzz? Isn't there a conflict of
interest with you two being here together?

185
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:56,731
Not at all. In fact, the city council and the
police have many interests in common.

186
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:58,991
Careful. There are limits.

187
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,956
Unfortunately. Especially when the
interest is so charming and so beautiful.

188
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:09,296
Don't try any of that Latin machismo
charm on her. She's a liberated woman.

189
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:12,423
But not that liberated.
Let the man have his say.

190
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,800
- Hi. Like to have your picture taken?
- Sure. Why not?

191
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:17,886
- I look awful.
- You look fine.

192
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:20,719
Here we go.

193
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,225
Wow.

194
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:33,149
Well, I gotta go catch me some criminals.

195
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,446
So soon?
You were just getting warmed up.

196
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:39,196
He's got hippies to beat up.

197
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:43,953
The day of a public servant is never over.
It has been delightful meeting you.

198
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,751
So long, you lucky dog.

199
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:58,053
- I'll have to take that, sweetheart.
- Get out of here. What do you want?

200
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:05,012
Shut up or I'll cut it off. I don't have time
to fuck around. Just give me the film.

201
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:17,106
You oughta be more careful
where you point that camera, sweetheart.

202
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:21,030
Baby, what are we doing in this dump?

203
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,493
You like it? I just bought it.

204
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:29,829
- You bought this place?
- Part of it, along with some other people.

205
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,124
- I guess I can drink to that.
- I got something better you can drink to.

206
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:37,376
- Remember that surprise I promised you?
- Yeah. What?

207
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:39,798
Meet Congressman Brunswick.

208
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:43,013
Congressman? Are you out of your mind?

209
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,390
No. They're gonna run me for Congress.

210
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:51,061
Really? Then let me congratulate you,
Congressman.

211
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:55,975
I ain't never screwed
a congressman before.

212
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,699
When you do that,
it makes me feel so good.

213
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:10,375
You make me feel so happy.

214
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:17,462
I love you, baby.

215
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:19,630
You're my woman.

216
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:26,504
I'll say I am. All yours.

217
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:30,224
My man.

218
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,985
What's the matter, Coffy, baby?

219
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:44,867
Something's been bothering you.

220
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:49,904
I've just been thinking about
having to go back to work tonight.

221
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,417
That night shift has been
making me a little jumpy.

222
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:57,628
I thought it was cos
when a man gets to my age,

223
00:18:57,755 --> 00:19:00,709
he can't satisfy
them lusty young bitches no more.

224
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:04,590
Don't start
gettin' insecure, Grandpa.

225
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:08,553
That long goody'll keep on working
as long as I'm able to handle it,

226
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:11,091
and you know it too, you old dog, you.

227
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:14,846
Oops! Ah!

228
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,851
You shouldn't have made me laugh.

229
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:25,687
That just goes to show
I been savin' it all for you.

230
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:28,530
I guess.

231
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:47,761
You know, baby,
I'm really due for a few days off.

232
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,296
Maybe a week.

233
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:55,308
We such a such a good time last year
in Hawaii. Could we go back?

234
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:59,731
I don't think so, baby. I'm gonna
be pretty busy with the campaign.

235
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,729
Then let's go up to the cabin.

236
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:06,313
- It's really nice in the mountains now.
- OK, baby. Look.

237
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:13,578
After the election, win or lose, we'll take
a couple of weeks off and go to Acapulco.

238
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:28,554
If you put it that way, baby...

239
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:16,015
- Hey, beautiful. You in trouble?
- No, I'm all right, thank you.

240
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,060
- I wanna help.
- Hands off. Ain't nothin' shakin'.

241
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:21,429
- Hold it. Police.
- What do you want?

242
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:24,352
I'll do the questioning.
You got identification?

243
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,975
Hold it. What's in that pocket?

244
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:30,903
Get up there.

245
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,905
- What you doin' here?
- My old lady's in the hospital.

246
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:42,040
There's no loitering in this lot.
I want you to move it. Move it, buddy.

247
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,967
Why, thank you, Officer.

248
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:56,588
At your service, ma'am.

249
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:58,764
Carter, what are you doin' here?

250
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:03,804
- Actually, I was lookin' for you.
- Really? Shit.

251
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:09,641
Coffy, is there something
you wanna talk to somebody about?

252
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:14,939
Yeah, as a matter of fact. Why don't we go
someplace and find a cup of coffee?

253
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:17,234
I make the greatest cup of coffee on earth.

254
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:21,077
<i>That is good.</i>

255
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:23,994
I feel better already.

256
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:27,127
We did have some good times together.

257
00:22:27,254 --> 00:22:30,540
Remember how you used to
make me laugh?

258
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,637
When was the last time I laughed?

259
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:44,093
Carter, have you done something
when you were mad - I mean really mad -

260
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,436
that it was like being in a dream?

261
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,685
Like being up in the ceiling
looking down on somebody?

262
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:52,570
- I think I know what you mean.
- The past few days...

263
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:03,152
Hello?

264
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,081
Hi, Mac.

265
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,746
I thought about it. I thought about it a lot.

266
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:12,255
I gotta tell you somethin'. Not only
am I not in, but if you go along with it,

267
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:15,585
I'll find a way to bust you
right along with the rest of 'em.

268
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,795
Do you hear me, Mac?

269
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:23,600
You better be hearin' me good
because that's the way it's gonna be.

270
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:54,963
Ever get the feelin' you talk too much?

271
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:58,128
What was that all about?

272
00:23:58,261 --> 00:24:01,962
That was me,
blowin' my piece of the action.

273
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:07,477
- What do you mean?
- My partner McHenry's on the take.

274
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:11,732
- Who's paying off?
- A gangster from Vegas named Vitroni.

275
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:15,393
Movin' into the black rackets
cos the big money now is in narcotics.

276
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,853
Taken over
most pimps and dealers already.

277
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,361
- Pimps?
- Yeah, like King George.

278
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:23,409
He's a big dealer too. It all goes together.

279
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,493
I've heard of King George.

280
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:30,248
So if everybody else is for sale,
why are you so special?

281
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:33,163
There's plenty of good cops left.

282
00:24:33,296 --> 00:24:36,665
What we need is more support
from the people.

283
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:42,548
Quick, get in there. Shut the door.

284
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:46,471
That's him!

285
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,895
Leave him alone!

286
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:58,988
Stay out of this, bitch.

287
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,033
Let's go.

288
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:20,339
- What are you doin'? We ain't got time.
- Just a second.

289
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,844
Jesus.

290
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,178
Come on, dammit.

291
00:25:34,773 --> 00:25:36,398
Carter?

292
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:45,697
I'll kill those bastards for this.
I swear I will.

293
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:49,360
He's not so good, Coffy.
Quite a bit of brain damage.

294
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:05,508
Down this way.

295
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:16,095
What are his chances, Doc?

296
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:19,315
He may be able to go to the bathroom
by himself someday.

297
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:23,274
- Somebody sure worked him over.
- Yeah.

298
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:29,407
Yeah, I'd sure like to get
my hands on the guys that did this.

299
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:44,832
What's happenin'? Do you know a lady
named Priscilla that lives around here?

300
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:47,637
Yeah. Back there up the steps.

301
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,861
Priscilla.

302
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:21,835
- Hello, Priscilla.
- Do I know you from somewhere?

303
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:25,047
Yeah. I helped sew up your face.
Remember?

304
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,131
Yeah.

305
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:32,302
The nurse at the hospital.

306
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:41,396
What do you want with me?

307
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:49,150
I see you're back on the junk again.

308
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:53,326
Just a little now and then.
I ain't got a habit any more.

309
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:57,580
You ain't? You still
street hustling for King George?

310
00:27:57,706 --> 00:28:01,918
No. Listen, my old man
is coming back any minute.

311
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:04,451
If she catches you, she'll kick your ass.

312
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:10,792
Don't get excited. I just wanna ask you
a few questions about King George.

313
00:28:10,928 --> 00:28:12,552
Yeah?

314
00:28:14,514 --> 00:28:16,139
Why?

315
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,766
You wanna get in the life?

316
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:22,935
Maybe.

317
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:27,561
I ain't seen him.

318
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:30,363
Not since I met Harriet.

319
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,775
And anyway...

320
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:38,580
I never was a street hustler.

321
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:43,781
I was his top call girl
and his personal old lady.

322
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,296
Until he cut your face.
Then you weren't so popular any more.

323
00:28:48,423 --> 00:28:51,709
Then he put you back on the street.
Ain't that right?

324
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:57,003
Yeah. That's because I got mad
and I called him a nigger.

325
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,636
- I knew I shouldn't have done that.
- Do you know this fellow Vitroni?

326
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,221
Arturo Vitroni? Sure.

327
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:08,274
All George's girls know Arturo.

328
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,604
Balling Arturo is like paying
your taxes to the government.

329
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:14,774
What's he like?

330
00:29:14,908 --> 00:29:19,285
You mean what is he like
or what does he like?

331
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:21,369
Both.

332
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:25,203
Well, he's kind of freaky.

333
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:28,458
Not too bad.

334
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:39,598
He likes a girl he thinks is foreign.

335
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:41,763
Exotic, you know?

336
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:50,014
I mean, you tell him you are the queen
of the giant Kluck-luks from Inner Siberia

337
00:29:50,151 --> 00:29:52,393
and he starts dripping in his pants,

338
00:29:52,528 --> 00:29:55,814
and the only way he's gonna get it off

339
00:29:55,948 --> 00:30:02,781
is to have you crawl around the floor, talk
bad to you, spit on you, things like that.

340
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:08,204
Where does King George find girls
that'll do that kind of an act?

341
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:14,338
Through his pushers. They find strung-out
chicks that do anything to get straight.

342
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:17,337
He has got people all over.

343
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:20,305
Now, one more thing.

344
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:25,132
- Where does he keep his supply?
- His sup...

345
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:29,020
Hey, what are you trying, to get me killed?

346
00:30:29,148 --> 00:30:32,813
Where does he keep it?
You know, don't you? You lived with him.

347
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:36,027
You get outta here right now.

348
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:38,443
Go on. Get outta here.

349
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:41,197
Get out!

350
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:50,163
So, you wanna play with knives?
You picked the wrong player.

351
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:56,047
No. Please, look,
I didn't mean nothin'. Please. Ow!

352
00:30:56,174 --> 00:31:00,124
I'll give you a slice to match the one
you got from that dope-pushin' pimp

353
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:02,385
unless you say where he keeps the stuff.

354
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:05,847
No, please. He'll kill me.

355
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:07,803
All right.

356
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:12,265
He's got a fireplace.
It's in a box under the ashes.

357
00:31:15,026 --> 00:31:18,360
Harriet! Harriet!

358
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,730
What the hell is going on here?

359
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:24,780
She busted in here trying to make me.
Get her outta here.

360
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:33,165
Come on, bitch.

361
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:47,012
You lousy bitch!

362
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:53,223
I go away for half an hour
for you to turn a trick,

363
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:59,441
and I come back and find you ballin'
some nigger bitch. You white tramp!

364
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,233
<i># George, George</i>

365
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:09,282

381
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:05,254
Yes. Mr George, I presume.

382
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:13,262
You're the lady from Jamaica
who called me.

383
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:17,806
That I am, man, and I can see that
you're not at all disappointed, of course,

384
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,190
so I'll come straight to the point,
as I like to do.

385
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:24,687
Bus! Another drink for my friend here.

386
00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:28,949
I presume a champagne cocktail
is sufficient?

387
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:33,369
Good. I assume you've got complete
protection from the police, have you?

388
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:34,576
Course.

389
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:38,407
Of course, man. I contacted you
as soon as I arrived from Kingston.

390
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:41,829
I'm told you are the very best
there is in your business.

391
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:44,289
Is that right, man?

392
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:46,582
- I'd say so.
- Good, man.

393
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:48,758
I don't do no leather work, man.

394
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:52,719
No whips, ropes, chains,
or none of those fetish freaks.

395
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:55,684
Just plain sex.

396
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:00,768
But for that I don't mind saying
that I am the very best in my business.

397
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:10,733
We'll just have to see
about that, won't we?

398
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:13,275
Course, man.

399
00:34:29,552 --> 00:34:36,682
These aren't gettin' any better. You're
gonna have to stay off your back awhile.

400
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,849
Oh, well.

401
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:50,902
Hello, Robert?

402
00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:53,949
Hi. This is Jeri.

403
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:56,484
I got your number from Lois.

404
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:59,028
You remember Lois.

405
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:04,159
Well, I'm new in town and I thought
you might like to meet me?

406
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:08,499
What do I do? What do you want?

407
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,292
Yes.

408
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:14,919
I know all about that.

409
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:20,802
Lois told me and it turned me on.

410
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:23,852
Hm?

411
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,403
I have long blonde hair,
blue eyes, creamy skin,

412
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:36,825
and I'm very busty, I guess you could say.

413
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:39,324
Hm?

414
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:41,531
I guess so.

415
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:43,705
What's your address?

416
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,712
Good grief.

417
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,878
Half-hour?

418
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:53,002
Mm.

419
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,844
Bye.

420
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:01,223
Jeri, this is for you. Better get dressed.

421
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:03,474
- Shit, Helen.
- Come on.

422
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:06,688
It's only a blow job in his office.

423
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,606
All right.

424
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:19,027
I'll be back soon
and take the rest of the night off.

425
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,252
What the hell's goin' on around here?

426
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:35,582
Looks like a goddamn pyjama party.
I want you to meet somebody.

427
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,301
This here's... Mystique.

428
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:45,846
Quite an assortment
you have here, man. Not too bad, really.

429
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:47,852
Yeah.

430
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:52,393
They'll do. Let's go
in the other room so we can talk.

431
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,122
Georgie, sweetie. Here I am. Surprise.

432
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:07,917
You weren't supposed
to get back until tonight.

433
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:11,493
I took the morning flight.
Miami was such a drag.

434
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,713
That old fart - he couldn't do anything.
I mean nothing!

435
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:19,549
A thousand bucks a day
just to show me off to his friends.

436
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:26,393
So what I need is some real action, honey.
The kind I can only get from my old man.

437
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:33,441
- Who's this?
- Meg, I want you to meet Mystique.

438
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:37,855
- Miss Stick? What kind of name is that?
- Jamaican.

439
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:40,396
She's gonna be a big asset
to our organisation.

440
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:44,365
Why don't you get yourself
a cup of coffee while I check her out?

441
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:48,409
What do you mean?
What's there to check out?

442
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,292
It's business. Go in there
and get a cup of coffee.

443
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:54,088
It's for the big man. The big V.

444
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:06,841
Someone better turn the fan on.
I think the temperature's rising.

445
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:09,645
Cindy, love, this one's for you.

446
00:38:12,147 --> 00:38:15,232
No. Not the fat man again.

447
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:26,750
- I want you to meet Mystique.
- Glad to know you. How are you?

448
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:35,385
- Good evening, Mr Vitroni.
- Hello, Studs.

449
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:47,408
Don't look so hostile, Studs.

450
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:51,660
We're all on the same side now.

451
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:54,575
You're working for us.

452
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,115
I work for the King.

453
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,291
That's all.

454
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:03,215
Studs, you need a manicure.

455
00:40:05,926 --> 00:40:08,596
You need a shine.

456
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:13,389
I tell you, you will not be sorry.

457
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:18,265
How d'you do? My name is Vitroni.

458
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:21,315
Yes, Mr Vitroni.

459
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:23,481
You're Mystique.

460
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:29,867
Sam. I think Mr Vitroni'd like
another drink. Come along.

461
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:40,368
Why, Mr Vitroni, you don't have a drink.

462
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:46,675
I'm so sorry, Miss Stick.

463
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:53,004
Here, let me help you.

464
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,425
My goodness, you really are a mess.

465
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,225
It was just an accident.
Accidents will happen.

466
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:04,816
- You are a very naughty girl.
- It was an accident.

467
00:41:04,943 --> 00:41:07,019
- It was not an accident.
- Yes, it was.

468
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:20,539
It was an accident, like she said.

469
00:42:05,128 --> 00:42:08,247
Now, Mr King Dope-Pusher,

470
00:42:08,381 --> 00:42:12,129
you're gonna have
a few irate customers pretty soon.

471
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,929
Sugar instead of smack.

472
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:05,343
Meg. You don't have any salad.

473
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,243
Look!

474
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,843
- Let them go.
- They're out of their goddamn minds.

475
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,027
They're so violent.

476
00:44:17,842 --> 00:44:20,049
I'll kill you.

477
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:33,682
Look at that. Watch her go!

478
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:49,283
Mr Vitroni, I gotta talk to you.

479
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:08,930
She's a wild animal.

480
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,475
I've got to have that girl, George. Tonight.

481
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:28,739
<i># Coffy, baby</i>

482
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:35,787

00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:39,703

00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:09,568
<i># No one knows and no one cares</i>

There you are.

506
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,945
The wildcat from the tropical jungle.

507
00:48:09,613 --> 00:48:12,282
Come. Let's get acquainted.

508
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:40,893
I'm told that you are
a dangerous man, Arturo.

509
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:43,059
I like that.

510
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:46,187
It excites me.

511
00:48:50,237 --> 00:48:54,780
And I can see that I'm having
a good effect on you also.

512
00:48:58,995 --> 00:49:01,035
My love.

513
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:07,033
Are you sure you're not
just a little black, Arturo?

514
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,210
You're amazing.

515
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:16,428
Let's go into the other room.
We'll be more comfortable.

516
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,594
Yes. Let's go.

517
00:49:55,802 --> 00:50:00,843
Get down on the floor where you belong,
you no-good, dirty, nigger bitch.

518
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:11,351
Please. I know I'm not
good enough for you.

519
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,858
But let me have
your precious white body just once.

520
00:50:24,872 --> 00:50:29,285
Then let me see you crawl
over here, you black trash.

521
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm not going to hurt you.
Come on. Crawl over here.

522
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,540
Crawl, nigger.

523
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:46,517
You want me to crawl,
white motherfucker?

524
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,016
What are you doin'? Put that down.

525
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,846
You wanna spit on me
and make me crawl?

526
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,269
I'm gonna piss on your grave tomorrow.

527
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:04,240
Hold it. Don't mess her up.
I don't want any marks on her body.

528
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:06,243
Look at this.

529
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:10,286
This is no Saturday-night special.
This is professional equipment.

530
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:14,664
- Probably got it from her cop boyfriend.
- You were right, Jake. Good work.

531
00:51:14,796 --> 00:51:18,165
I recognised her when she swung
that bottle on that broad's head.

532
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,550
- I don't forget nothin' like that.
- Get Aleva up here now.

533
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:26,091
- I wanna find out what this is all about.
- George sent her to hit you. What else?

534
00:51:26,224 --> 00:51:30,352
Yeah. I never did have trust
for that pimp. None of them niggers.

535
00:51:30,478 --> 00:51:33,563
Nah, he'd never be so foolish.

536
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,273
This is somebody bigger
than King George.

537
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,610
How 'bout it, chocolate? Who set this up?

538
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:45,531
Spit it out.

539
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,412
He asked you a question.

540
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,994
It was King George.

541
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:57,709
He set it up. He's been workin'
with the brothers all along.

542
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:06,510
Hit him.

543
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,139
And hit him so that everybody else
will get the idea.

544
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,275
- Is this her?
- Yeah.

545
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,453
You know her?

546
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:39,333
Mr Vitroni, you got big trouble. Bigger
trouble than you ever could imagine.

547
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,589
George, you gonna stay mad
at me for ever?

548
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:54,937
I hurt, George. I feel awful.

549
00:52:58,524 --> 00:53:01,394
You could at least talk to me.

550
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:08,230
Who's that for so early in the morning?

551
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:10,406
Some dude.

552
00:53:15,332 --> 00:53:19,330
George, are you thinkin'
about turnin' me out?

553
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:24,379
No, baby. No.

554
00:53:29,096 --> 00:53:33,010
I just got so mad at the way you were
treating that phoney black chick.

555
00:53:33,141 --> 00:53:35,383
Yeah, I know.

556
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:41,816
I don't see why you have to go to all that
trouble for that pervert gangster, anyway.

557
00:53:41,942 --> 00:53:44,611
I'm just doing him a favour.

558
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:51,318
Most people appreciate favours.

559
00:53:55,288 --> 00:53:59,286
They never forget you
when you do them a favour.

560
00:54:04,172 --> 00:54:08,585
There's somethin' funny about that chick.
Somethin' just not right.

561
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:10,841
That so?

562
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:13,010
- George?
- What?

563
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:18,557
- Please don't go.
- Baby, I gotta go out.

564
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:23,645
One of Vitroli's boys called with a buyer
who wants to score right away.

565
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:26,811
I'll be back.

566
00:54:30,406 --> 00:54:33,158
Let me take care of you.
I really feel like it now.

567
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:35,324
No, baby, not now.

568
00:54:37,163 --> 00:54:40,864
Baby, you still love me, don't you?

569
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,330
Yeah. I still love you, baby,
you know that. You're my lady.

570
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:51,252
Look, how long will it be before
you'll be able to take a trick again?

571
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:55,382
About a week or so. Is that OK, baby?

572
00:54:58,309 --> 00:55:01,061
Yeah. That's fine. Look.

573
00:55:02,396 --> 00:55:05,896
You can take care of me
when I get back, OK?

574
00:55:07,735 --> 00:55:10,404
OK. I'll be waitin', lover.

575
00:55:19,413 --> 00:55:22,248
Hello, King. Hop in. Let's talk.

576
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:29,336
I'm sorry, man. I can't argue with no.45.

577
00:55:32,384 --> 00:55:34,673
Get rolling, Studs.

578
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:47,227
OK, come on, you guys.
What's this shit? What's the gag?

579
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:51,770
- It's going to be very funny.
- I'll take this, King.

580
00:55:52,654 --> 00:55:54,730
I know. I know.

581
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:59,942
The big man's got a bonus for me
for that cool little trick I sent him, right?

582
00:56:00,078 --> 00:56:02,118
That's right, King.

583
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:08,580
Jesus. You guys had me
goin' there for a minute.

584
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:11,998
Hey, Studs! Look at him. Look at Studs.

585
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:16,219
Look at him. Hey, Studs.

586
00:56:19,264 --> 00:56:23,677
Studs, baby, it's OK. It's all right, Studs.

587
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,852
Hey, baby, they're just jivin'.
They're just puttin' you on.

588
00:56:28,982 --> 00:56:31,936
- Big V was tickled almost to death.
- Really?

589
00:56:32,068 --> 00:56:35,651
He said he'd never had
nothin' like that before. Ever.

590
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,734
That's good. That's really great.

591
00:56:45,624 --> 00:56:47,034
Hey.

592
00:56:50,045 --> 00:56:52,286
Where we goin'?

593
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,832
That's the surprise.

594
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:58,719
We don't want to spoil it for you.

595
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,140
Hey.

596
00:57:11,024 --> 00:57:16,149
Man, could I have my Kodak back?
I got a man who needs that today.

597
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:21,486
No, he don't, King. You quit your worryin'.
It's all gonna be over real soon.

598
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:24,322
Yeah, sure.

599
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:27,823
Studs, you stop here. This is OK.

600
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,829
Wait a minute. There's something
you dudes ain't tellin' me.

601
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:39,924
- Out, King.
- No, man.

602
00:57:40,052 --> 00:57:42,378
- Out!
- I am not gettin' outta this car.

603
00:57:42,513 --> 00:57:45,004
Will somebody please talk to me?

604
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:49,352
Wait a minute! Somebody please tell me,
man, what have I done?

605
00:57:52,314 --> 00:57:56,976
It's a beautiful suit, King.
You remember I had a surprise for you?

606
00:57:57,111 --> 00:58:00,396
A new necktie. Special woven.

607
00:58:00,531 --> 00:58:02,689
14 nubile maidens.

608
00:58:02,825 --> 00:58:06,490
Come on. Cut out the jokin'. Come on.

609
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,914
I can take a joke as good as anybody,
man, but this has gone too damn far.

610
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,959
Man, tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?

611
00:58:14,086 --> 00:58:17,336
I don't even know what I did.
Come on, now. Studs.

612
00:58:17,464 --> 00:58:22,625
Studs, don't just sit there.
Do somethin'. Studs! Studs!

613
00:58:24,555 --> 00:58:28,006
This is the way we lynch niggers.

614
00:58:28,142 --> 00:58:31,226
Stop the car!
Guys, I'll do anything you want!

615
00:58:31,353 --> 00:58:35,054
What did I do wrong? Jesus! Look out!

616
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:38,108
God, please! Stop the car! What did I do?

617
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:41,485
Somebody tell... Jesus Christ!

618
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:45,029
You guys, stop the car!
Please! What did I do?

619
00:58:47,953 --> 00:58:50,989
You wanna go fast, Studs?

620
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,960
Studs, that could be you if you like to talk.

621
00:59:50,223 --> 00:59:54,683
I know, I know.
My mama didn't raise no fool.

622
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:58,511
Studs, you're a good boy.
You're going to need a job soon.

623
00:59:58,648 --> 01:00:01,103
Come to us.
You'll find out we're not bad people.

624
01:00:01,484 --> 01:00:04,568
This vicious combination
of big business and government

625
01:00:04,695 --> 01:00:08,645
has kept our sisters prostitute
and our brothers dope peddlers.

626
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:11,321
I was talking to a young man at the clinic.

627
01:00:11,452 --> 01:00:15,070
He had so many needle marks
he couldn't find a place for another spike.

628
01:00:15,206 --> 01:00:19,951
He had to make at least one burglary each
night to support his $100-a-day habit.

629
01:00:20,086 --> 01:00:23,003
I asked him
"Why would anyone start smacking up

630
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:25,752
when they know
what the result is gonna be?"

631
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:31,387
He said "I'd rather be a junkie than
be nothing." You see what this tells us?

632
01:00:31,514 --> 01:00:35,807
Our power structure has given this man
no reasonable alternative.

633
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:40,347
You ask "Why would a power structure
deliberately create narcotics addicts?"

634
01:00:40,481 --> 01:00:45,309
I ask you, where do you think
that $100 a day goes?

635
01:00:45,444 --> 01:00:48,647
Part of it goes to the black
pushers and distributors,

636
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:51,354
but the main part of it, the really big part,

637
01:00:51,492 --> 01:00:54,243
goes to those white men
who import the narcotics.

638
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:58,581
The big part goes to those white men who
corrupt our law-enforcement agencies.

639
01:00:58,707 --> 01:01:01,115
And the big part goes to those white men

640
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:04,418
who draft our black boys
and send them over to Indochina

641
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:09,173
to protect other white men who were
the original suppliers of the narcotics.

642
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:13,762
It becomes a vicious attempt
on the part of the white power structure

643
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:17,340
to exploit our black men
and women in this society.

644
01:01:17,476 --> 01:01:18,555
Right.

645
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:23,431
Cut. That was good. We'll use the first part
of that one and the ending of the last take.

646
01:01:23,565 --> 01:01:26,851
Nice going, Howard. Real convincing.

647
01:01:55,096 --> 01:01:57,967
Hey, out there. Is anybody there?

648
01:02:00,769 --> 01:02:05,810
- Can I have somethin' to eat?
- Goddamn son of a bitch woman.

649
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:10,611
Shut up, bitch! Want me
to give you another clout?

650
01:02:10,737 --> 01:02:14,485
Can I have a glass of water?
Are you tryin' to starve me to death?

651
01:02:14,616 --> 01:02:18,660
Never mind. Just keep quiet.
You won't need no water or nothin'.

652
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,479
Hello, Councilman.

653
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:39,986
Hello, McHenry.
Who else is here? Your boss?

654
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:42,442
Yeah. This is strictly summit stuff.

655
01:03:42,578 --> 01:03:46,410
Personally, I don't know what it's all about
and I don't wanna know.

656
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,209
You're a smart cop, Sergeant.

657
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,986
Mr Congressman Brunswick.

658
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:21,027
They tell me you kissed off
your campaign today. How did it go?

659
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,067
- Very well.
- Yes?

660
01:04:23,201 --> 01:04:26,570
Well, we're all behind you, all the way.

661
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:30,831
You should keep your boys away
from where I'm appearing.

662
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:35,122
People keep turning up in photos.
Somebody'll start making comparisons.

663
01:04:35,255 --> 01:04:37,828
I never appear in photographs.

664
01:04:37,966 --> 01:04:41,465
True. Aleva is very careful about that.

665
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:45,177
OK. What did you get me
out here for, anyway?

666
01:04:45,306 --> 01:04:49,007
I thought we'd agreed on everything.
I'm taking a chance being here.

667
01:04:49,143 --> 01:04:52,927
It's dangerous for me too, Howard,
but this is important.

668
01:04:53,064 --> 01:04:55,981
Some very strange things
have been happening.

669
01:04:56,109 --> 01:04:58,148
There's something I don't know about.

670
01:04:58,277 --> 01:05:00,899
Perhaps, Councilman. Perhaps.

671
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,408
Hey, darky.

672
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,659
You ain't gonna try to hit me
with one of them rocks?

673
01:05:13,793 --> 01:05:18,253
I'm so weak from hunger I couldn't even
kick sand in your face, motherfucker.

674
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:24,132
There's a friend of yours inside
wants to see you.

675
01:05:24,261 --> 01:05:26,301
Come on.

676
01:05:28,683 --> 01:05:31,256
Come on, come on.

677
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:48,783
Gotta hand it to you.
You were a hundred per cent right.

678
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:52,362
He knows her all right.
He introduced her to me one night.

679
01:05:52,498 --> 01:05:54,621
Sure I know her.

680
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,830
She's just some broad I fuck.
What's she doin' here?

681
01:05:58,962 --> 01:06:02,047
This broad you fuck tried to kill me.

682
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:06,049
That's what she's doing here.

683
01:06:06,178 --> 01:06:08,052
What?

684
01:06:15,229 --> 01:06:18,183
That's right. Don't look at him.

685
01:06:19,816 --> 01:06:25,273
Young lady, I want you to understand we
have no personal thing against you at all.

686
01:06:26,198 --> 01:06:29,318
I know that you were
only following orders,

687
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:34,492
so there is no reason
why we cannot be friends, is there?

688
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,157
I'm not a bad man, like I told you.

689
01:06:38,293 --> 01:06:41,958
I don't want to see
a pretty young girl go to waste,

690
01:06:42,088 --> 01:06:44,710
with your whole life ahead of you.

691
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:50,714
Just tell me the truth and you can go free,
and no harm will come to you.

692
01:06:53,266 --> 01:06:59,139
Look, do you understand what it means
when a man swears by his mother?

693
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:03,943
I swear by my mother.

694
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:07,863
Now, just tell me.

695
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:11,025
Did this man send you to kill me?

696
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:15,322
No. He didn't know nothin'.
Only King George, like I told you.

697
01:07:15,455 --> 01:07:18,076
She's his girl.
What do you expect her to say?

698
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:23,664
Howard, I'm sure, personally,
that you had nothing to do with this.

699
01:07:23,796 --> 01:07:28,043
But this is a very serious matter.
We've got a very profitable relationship.

700
01:07:28,176 --> 01:07:32,470
But it depends entirely
on mutual trust and confidence.

701
01:07:32,597 --> 01:07:36,464
That's right. We've gone
a long way with you, Brunswick.

702
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:39,471
But if we have to,
we'll find another congressman.

703
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:42,225
- Howard!
- Shut up!

704
01:07:42,356 --> 01:07:44,396
You did your talking.

705
01:07:45,526 --> 01:07:49,606
Why would I want
to have you killed, Vitroni?

706
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:52,064
I like to steal as much as you do.

707
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:54,239
I can answer that, Mr Vitroni.

708
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:58,033
These people all stick together
like brothers. You can't trust 'em.

709
01:07:58,164 --> 01:08:01,864
Those two pushers that got killed
last month had just come in with us.

710
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:04,124
Then King George double-crossing us.

711
01:08:04,253 --> 01:08:06,922
All brothers, remember?
And he's one of them.

712
01:08:07,047 --> 01:08:12,208
And money or deals or anything
don't make him one of us. Shit.

713
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:22,520
You've been listening
to my political speeches.

714
01:08:24,773 --> 01:08:28,142
I thought you'd be more intelligent
than to listen to that crap.

715
01:08:28,277 --> 01:08:31,895
For Christ's sake, black, brown or yellow,
I'm in it for the green.

716
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:34,070
The green buck.

717
01:08:34,908 --> 01:08:37,446
As far as that chick
over there's concerned,

718
01:08:37,578 --> 01:08:40,744
I'll tell you how much she means to me.

719
01:08:41,999 --> 01:08:44,038
Yeah?

720
01:08:44,918 --> 01:08:46,626
Take her...

721
01:08:56,597 --> 01:09:01,223
Will you say that out loud
so these people can hear you?

722
01:09:09,276 --> 01:09:11,945
Take her out and kill her.

723
01:09:17,701 --> 01:09:21,485
Now let's get down
to some serious business.

724
01:09:55,196 --> 01:09:57,652
Mac, the spike kit.

725
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:09,368
- Have you got the smack?
- Yeah.

726
01:10:09,502 --> 01:10:12,871
Took some off our late friend the King.

727
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,675
I wonder where he's king of now.

728
01:10:23,182 --> 01:10:29,137
No, thanks. Can't you read the package? It
says smoking is dangerous to your health.

729
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:33,103
I didn't know that.
I'm gonna have to give this up.

730
01:10:33,234 --> 01:10:35,939
You ever shoot up before?

731
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:39,355
Once or twice. I can take it or leave it.

732
01:10:41,242 --> 01:10:44,408
That's good. I can take it or leave it.

733
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:48,078
That's very good.

734
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:53,206
Mac, go down along the river,
under the freeway.

735
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:55,376
Right. Good idea.

736
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:34,287
You're luckier than most people
that gotta go out.

737
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:38,666
- This is just about the nicest way to do it.
- Yeah.

738
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:42,049
I just want you to know that, personally,

739
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:46,388
I think it's a damn shame
to let a good piece like you go to waste.

740
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:48,424
Thanks. I do too.

741
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:54,762
Especially when I think of all the fun
I could've had with a stud like you.

742
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:57,187
Yeah?

743
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:59,772
You really mean that?

744
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,615
- Well, it ain't too late.
- It ain't.

745
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:08,739
Hell, no. I can take care of you right now.

746
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:12,368
Right here and now.

747
01:12:13,374 --> 01:12:16,210
Nick, you go take a walk.

748
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:19,750
Not in my office you don't.

749
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:24,626
You wanna pull that shit,
go on back there someplace.

750
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:26,171
Hey.

751
01:12:28,389 --> 01:12:32,719
- Let me do this first.
- OK. I'm not gonna fight you.

752
01:12:34,145 --> 01:12:36,980
Mac, shine your light back here.

753
01:12:37,982 --> 01:12:40,817
Don't look. Don't look.

754
01:12:40,943 --> 01:12:42,983
Sh, sh, sh.

755
01:12:58,628 --> 01:13:00,003
Come on, let's go.

756
01:13:31,702 --> 01:13:35,153
- Shit! Hurry up, man.
- OK. Just a second.

757
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:40,710
- Come on. Shit, what are you waitin' for?
- All right, all right.

758
01:13:40,836 --> 01:13:42,875
Goddamn zippers.

759
01:14:08,113 --> 01:14:09,311
Nick!

760
01:14:10,449 --> 01:14:13,948
- What happened?
- She did it. You get her!

761
01:14:14,077 --> 01:14:16,829
- I'm bleeding. Please help me.
- Mac!

762
01:14:16,955 --> 01:14:18,995
Get a doctor.

763
01:14:19,124 --> 01:14:21,330
Mac, take care of him. I'll get her.

764
01:14:21,459 --> 01:14:24,626
Mac! Mac, please help me!

765
01:14:26,756 --> 01:14:28,796
Get a doctor.

766
01:14:29,884 --> 01:14:31,794
Sugar. Sugar!

767
01:14:31,928 --> 01:14:34,680
Get an ambulance, please!

768
01:14:34,806 --> 01:14:38,590
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll take care of that.

769
01:14:48,153 --> 01:14:49,896
Mac.

770
01:14:50,029 --> 01:14:52,318
Mac, don't leave me!

771
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,366
Mac!

772
01:15:05,003 --> 01:15:07,042
Come back!

773
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:30,556
Help me. Help me.

774
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:33,060
Help me!

775
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,398
Help me, somebody!

776
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:41,281
Help me! This thing's gonna burn up.

777
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:56,870
Hey, baby. You need a ride or anything?

778
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,340
I sure do. I had some trouble
with my boyfriend and got turned out.

779
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:06,340
That's too bad. Just get right in
and let's see what we can do about it.

780
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:15,681
Could we stop at a liquor store
and get some juice? I need a drink.

781
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:17,145
OK.

782
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,661
Don't go away, beautiful. I'll be right back.

783
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,834
I won't, baby.

784
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,363
Hey! Hey, come on back!

785
01:19:55,748 --> 01:19:59,876
Gentleman, it does my heart good
to see the various races getting together

786
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:02,042
in such a spirit of cooperation.

787
01:20:02,171 --> 01:20:05,623
Yes. I've gotta be going.

788
01:20:05,758 --> 01:20:10,052
I've got a friend waiting,
I hope, very impatiently.

789
01:20:10,179 --> 01:20:12,801
- Goin' out to your place at the beach?
- Yeah.

790
01:20:12,932 --> 01:20:15,423
It's a good life, no?

791
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,596
It can be, Ruben. It can be.

792
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:23,477
Good night, gentlemen. I hope
we don't have to meet like this again.

793
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:26,361
It's been a great risk.

794
01:21:16,078 --> 01:21:20,076
So I looked at him
and he said "That's all I got."

795
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:28,789
The boys should be back now.
I wonder if something went wrong.

796
01:21:31,301 --> 01:21:34,338
I think I hear them coming now.

797
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:36,629
Sounds like he's really movin'.

798
01:22:27,148 --> 01:22:29,817
Shit. Come on, now.

799
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:37,152
- Look, I ain't gonna shoot you.
- Please, don't shoot. Don't shoot.

800
01:22:37,283 --> 01:22:41,233
I'll pay you anything.
A million dollars. Whatever you want.

801
01:22:41,371 --> 01:22:44,122
A million dollars. You got a deal.
I won't kill you.

802
01:22:44,248 --> 01:22:46,537
It's Brunswick I want, anyway.
Where is he?

803
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:49,834
He left. He went to his house at the beach.

804
01:22:49,962 --> 01:22:52,085
Yeah. I know the place.

805
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:55,298
Thanks.

806
01:22:59,013 --> 01:23:03,924
That's a present from my little sister,
and a nice cop named Carter.

807
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:09,912
Hello, Howard. Come on
and sit down and talk to me.

808
01:24:10,042 --> 01:24:12,663
I'm not mad at you.

809
01:24:12,794 --> 01:24:14,834
Coffy, baby.

810
01:24:14,963 --> 01:24:18,628
I'm glad to see you.
I knew they weren't really gonna do it.

811
01:24:18,759 --> 01:24:22,708
I ain't here because they didn't try, lover.

812
01:24:24,306 --> 01:24:28,600
They would've done it anyway,
no matter what I said. You know that.

813
01:24:28,727 --> 01:24:32,226
Yeah, I know. I told you, I ain't mad at you.

814
01:24:32,355 --> 01:24:35,273
- Why don't you let me have the thing?
- No!

815
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:41,070
Before you try to take it, I think you better
know that all your friends are dead.

816
01:24:41,197 --> 01:24:45,491
Vitroni, Ramos, McHenry
and some others too. I killed 'em all.

817
01:24:45,618 --> 01:24:47,410
You?

818
01:24:47,537 --> 01:24:50,242
I don't know how I did it.

819
01:24:50,373 --> 01:24:52,911
It seems like I'm in a dream.

820
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:58,629
And I'm still in this dream, Howard. And it
wouldn't take much for me to kill you now.

821
01:24:58,756 --> 01:25:04,592
I can see how you might feel that way
but... you don't understand all the facts.

822
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:07,924
I did what I did for my people,
for our brothers and sisters.

823
01:25:08,057 --> 01:25:13,811
You shouldn't talk to me about sisters,
Howard. I've got a sister.

824
01:25:13,938 --> 01:25:18,517
Why don't you just relax
and let me pour you a drink?

825
01:25:18,651 --> 01:25:20,976
You're upset. You can see that, can't you?

826
01:25:21,112 --> 01:25:25,857
I can see plenty. I can see how each time
a kid rips off a car or an appliance store

827
01:25:25,992 --> 01:25:28,696
or a house to get money for a fix,
you get your cut.

828
01:25:28,828 --> 01:25:34,747
Don't be naive. Do you think if I weren't
mixed up with rackets there'd be none?

829
01:25:34,876 --> 01:25:37,995
Wherever there's a need,
somebody comes along to fill it.

830
01:25:38,129 --> 01:25:41,379
Black people want dope,
and brown people want dope,

831
01:25:41,507 --> 01:25:44,212
and as long as people
are deprived of a decent life,

832
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:48,044
they're gonna want something
to just plain feel good with.

833
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:52,225
And nothing's gonna change that
except money and power.

834
01:25:52,351 --> 01:25:54,723
And that's what I'm after, baby.

835
01:25:54,854 --> 01:25:57,605
Power to change things for our people.

836
01:25:57,731 --> 01:26:01,397
I want all that money back in the hands
of black people like you and me.

837
01:26:01,527 --> 01:26:06,652
Yes, like you too, Coffy. You can help me,
baby, to make a better life for our people.

838
01:26:06,782 --> 01:26:11,740
Bullshit! You're just sellin' out
to the white gangsters and businessmen.

839
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,910
You're worse than they are.

840
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:17,954
And I loved you. I loved you so much.

841
01:26:19,586 --> 01:26:22,671
And you still do, baby.

842
01:26:22,798 --> 01:26:24,672
You know it.

843
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,125
And I love you.

844
01:26:27,261 --> 01:26:32,255
And we're gonna do big things together,
baby, cos you're my woman, Coffy.

845
01:26:34,643 --> 01:26:38,972
Maybe I have done a few bad things,
but that's the way the world is today.

846
01:26:39,106 --> 01:26:42,107
Sometimes you have to do
a few little wrong things

847
01:26:42,234 --> 01:26:44,392
in order to do one big right thing.

848
01:26:44,528 --> 01:26:49,486
That's what I'm trying to do for you and
for our people - that one big right thing.

849
01:26:49,616 --> 01:26:53,661
You always were a good talker, Howard.

850
01:26:53,787 --> 01:26:57,238
You could talk me into almost anything.

851
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:03,624
But I don't know.
I just don't know any more.

852
01:27:03,755 --> 01:27:06,756
All you have to know, baby,
is that I'm your man.

853
01:27:06,883 --> 01:27:11,878
I'm gonna take care of you
and I'm gonna steer you straight.

854
01:27:12,013 --> 01:27:15,299
I been missing you
these past few days, Coffy.

855
01:27:15,433 --> 01:27:18,849
And I've been wantin' you real bad.

856
01:27:18,978 --> 01:27:25,017
Why don't you just put that thing down
and come and fold yourself up in my arms

857
01:27:25,151 --> 01:27:30,109
and I'll make all this crap go away,
like it's never been.

858
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,438
Come on.

859
01:27:31,574 --> 01:27:35,358
Howie, what are you doing?
Come back to bed.

860
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:43,417
Coffy, baby. You gotta understand,
I thought you were dead.
