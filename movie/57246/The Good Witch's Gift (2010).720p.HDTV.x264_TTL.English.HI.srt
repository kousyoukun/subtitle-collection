Derek? I'm just doing a
little window shopping.

What about jewellery, Derek?

I mean, Cassie's tastes

Hi.

Hi, you looking for someone?

23
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,838
I thought I saw someone who I...

24
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,741
knew, but...

25
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:33,639
Well, this is the season
to reach out to old friends.

26
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:35,013
Aren't you cold?

27
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,384
Oh, no, I just came out
to check my window display.

28

Doesn't that make you want to step inside?

- When did you get the automatic doors?
- I didn't.

Hey.

31
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,027
Can you do that in uniform?

00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,868
I'm the chief, I can do whatever I want.

33
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,597
In that case, do it again.

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,890
I've decided. The wedding
should be in April.

35
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:13,421
Hmm... April can be very unpredictable.

36
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,160
- So can you.
- Hmm, I suppose.

37
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:17,291
But when it comes to Christmas,

38
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,981
I can be very traditional.

39
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:21,191
Oh, I love the season.

40
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,161
Can't say the same for
everybody in my house.

41
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,458
Oh?

42
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,516
You know, Christmas
really hasn't been the same

43
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:28,845
since Jenny passed away.

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,444
Yeah, they miss their mom.

45
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:35,664
I got my Christmas shopping done.

46
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:38,601
Except for you.

47
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:40,752
I have the only gift I need.

48
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:45,064
You're my bride to be, this
has to be the perfect gift.

49
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,527
What's this?

50
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:49,376
An astrological calendar.

51
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:51,363
For this year.

52
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,841
There's two weeks left.

53
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,625
People have a lot to do in these two weeks.

54
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:56,495
Tell me about it.

55
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,176
Why don't you keep it?

56
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:02,111
- Oh...
- Jake, it's not your only gift,

57
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,117
just think of it as a stocking stuffer.

58
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,722
Thank you.

59
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:16,894
So? Any luck?

60
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,233
Oh, no, but I should have
a positive ID any minute now

61
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:21,658
if it's who I think it is.

62
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,823
No, I meant did you find
something for Cassie?

63
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:27,540
Oh, no, not yet.

64
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:30,380
It's gotta be the best Christmas gift ever.

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,721
Well, yeah, she is your fiancée.

66
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,207
It's not that, Derek, it's...

67
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:37,587
Cassie spent a lot of sad Christmas
mornings at that foster home.

68
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:40,426
Maybe when you two
finally pick a wedding date

69
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,075
next year will be a little different.

70
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:45,220
We've been trying to pick
a wedding date for months.

71
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:46,971
Give me this.

72
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:50,127
Jake, how are you going to
find a wedding date next year?

73
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,067
This is this year's calendar.

74
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,069
(Computer beeping)

75
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:56,915
Leon Deeks.

76
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:58,951
What?

77
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,844
Leon Deeks.

78
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:03,126
In a message from State Prison,

79
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:06,237
"Leon Deeks was released from
federal prison two days ago".

80
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,111
I knew that's who I saw.

81
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:11,338
Served 10 years out of a 15 year sentence.

82
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,976
How do you know this guy?

83
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:15,723
Do you remember the Shelbyville
National Bank robbery?

84
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:18,400
- I remember hearing about it.
- He was the robber.

85
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,059
What do you think he's doing here?

86
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,431
I think he's either here to
visit his ex-wife and daughter

87
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:24,080
who still live in Middleton,

88
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:25,770
or...

89
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,724
Or what?

90
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,113
After the robbery, I was
the one who arrested him

91
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,813
and sent him to prison.

92
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:33,994
Whoa.

93
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,141
"Whoa" is right.

94
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:37,953
Let's take a drive through town.

95
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:39,755
See if he's still window shopping.

96
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:41,465
How much did Deeks walk away with?

97
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:42,941
$100,000.

98
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,437
Still missing.

99
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,706
(Whistling)

100
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,183
Are you alright?

101
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:13,793
That wind, it just loves
to open and close my door.

102
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,282
- Who are you?
- I'm Cassie Nightingale.

103
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:19,295
The proprietor. Welcome.

104
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,998
So, uh, you did all this?

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,429
CASSIE: Excuse me?

106
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:34,062
All this work. It's so broken down.

107
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,892
Oh, yeah, I suppose it was pretty run down.

108
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:39,915
I was just glad I was able
to give it a second chance.

109
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:42,542
I love second chances, don't you?

110
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:46,327
I don't know. I'm still
waiting for my first.

111
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,121
- Are you from around here?
- I used to be.

112
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:53,042
Then maybe you know my
fiancé, Jake Russell?

113
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,489
Yeah, Chief Russell. Yeah, we go way back.

114
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,662
Are you hunting for anything in particular?

115
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:03,909
- Huh?
- In the shop?

116
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,759
Uh, what's that back there? Feathers?

117
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,075
CASSIE: Peacock feathers. Just got them in.

118
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,599
I'll just be a minute,
they're still in the box.

119
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:19,528
Feel free to look around!

120
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,823

Hey, Grandpa.

136
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:14,080
Tinsel or no tinsel this year?

137
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,116
You decide.

138
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:19,057
You... you're going to help
me decorate, aren't you?

139
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:22,131
Uh, no, I'm headed out
to a movie with my...

140
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:24,065
friend.

141
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,652
We'll be grabbing pizza later.

142
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:28,716
- I guess your dad knows?
- Of course.

143
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,016
I'm outta here. Back before 10:00.

144
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,652
- See ya.
- Well, Lori,

145
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:37,677
looks like it's you and me tonight.

146
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,621
Dad's going out with Cassie, so...

147
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,980
How about you and I stir up
a batch of Christmas cookies?

148
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:44,801
Christmas cookies?

149
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:46,084
You know the little round ones you like

150
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:46,990
with the powdered sugar?

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,493
Sorry, I'm going to a sleepover with Amy.

152
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:53,005
- Didn't Dad tell you?
- Oh... no.

153
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,700
- No, he didn't.
- (Horn honking outside)

154
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,929
Oh, there's my ride.

155
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,372
Later!

156
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:10,896
Resolved that Betty will
repaint her business sign

157
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,586
out by the highway.

158
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:13,837
What?

159
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:15,456
Passed!

160
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,713
But I need that sign for
my bakery to do business!

161
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,820
Uh-uh, ASAP, Betty.

162
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,058
We want the holiday shoppers visiting town

163
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,003
to feel good about Middleton.

164
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,985
It's all about the
gracious, traditional image

165
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,410
that we want to project.

166
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,608
But your slogan?

167
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:34,805
"Turn left for the best
sticky buns in the state!"

168
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,247
- Ugh!
- Well, they are...

169
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,884
It's just so tacky.

170
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:42,712
After all, Middleton is not a truck stop!

171
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,583
So, if there is no further business,

172
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:48,655
everyone have a very merry Christmas,

173
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,420
the happiest of holidays,

174
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:53,228
etcetera, etcetera, and so forth.

175
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:55,356
This session of the
Middleton Citizen's League

176
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,299
is hereby adjourned!

177
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,807
Whoo!

178
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,363
Have you thought about my proposal?

179
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,500
About Cassie Nightingale?

180
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,427
Inviting her to join the Citizen's League?

181
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,714
(Giggling) Oh, my dear Gwen.

182
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:17,543
(Snorting) I thought you were joking!

183
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:18,976
MAN: Oh, Martha?

184
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:20,618
Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.

185
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,703
- Gwen.
- Hello, dear.

186
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:26,520
I love my new gavel! A
little present to myself.

187
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,241
Martha, walk with me a minute.

188
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,012
Oh, well, you'll have to walk quickly.

189
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,833
I'm late for my mani-pedi.

190
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:34,338
Martha, this isn't easy for me to say.

191
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:37,564
I just finished talking
with our business manager.

192
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,164
- It's about our real estate investments.
- What about them?

193
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:41,711
They failed.

194
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,853
What do you mean?

195
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:47,248
We've lost everything.

196
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,427
- Not the Orlando condo?
- Everything.

197
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,638
Martha, we're broke. All our money is gone.

198
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:58,051
How can that be?

199
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:01,939
We're not destitute. I still
have my mayor's salary, our house.

200
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,463
But there will have to be some changes.

201
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,837
Oh, Tom...

202
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,188
You know how I hate changes!

203
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,468
Well, for a start...

204
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:13,365
- you have to get a job.
- (Gasping)

205
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:15,309
A jo...

206
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:19,997
- What about the Citizen's League?
- A paying job.

207
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:21,813
Until we get back on our feet.

208
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,088
I don't understand! How
could this have happened?

209
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:28,075
What's happened to a lot of people.

210
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:32,456
We'll pull through.

211
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,752
And we'll talk more tonight, okay?

212
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,225
Oh, and Martha?

213
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,658
Until further notice,

214
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:44,978
please do your own nails.

215
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:56,627
I wonder if we're going to get
a white Christmas this year.

216
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:59,937
- I hope not.
- How come?

217
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,456
I mean, why waste a perfectly good snow day

218
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,883
when we're going to be off school anyway?

219
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,733
(Chuckling)

220
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:08,300
Think the stores will
be open after the movie?

221
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:09,812
Maybe.

222
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,822
I want to get my mom
something different this year.

223
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,385
Any ideas?

224
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:16,607
A snow shovel?

225
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:18,880
(Chuckling)

226
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:31,220
Hello, Jake.

227
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,075
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

228
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:36,056
What a nice surprise.

229
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,532
Well, speaking of surprises,

230
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,590
- I've got one for you.
- Hmm!

231
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:43,904
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

232
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,088
I got your Christmas gift.

233
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:51,106
Jake, I already told you, you
don't have to give me anything.

234
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:52,767
No, you gave me this calendar,

235
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,109
and I've been looking at it,

236
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:56,115
and I decided one gift deserves another.

237
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,616
So this is the most exciting
gift that I can imagine.

238
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,507
Well, I could do with a little excitement.

239
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,749
My bed and breakfast gets
very quiet over the holidays.

240
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:05,531
Cassie...

241
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,319
I want to give you a family for Christmas.

242
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:10,596
What do you mean?

243
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,321
I mean let's get married.

244
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:13,556
(Chuckling)

245
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:15,213
I think I already said yes.

246
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,740
No, I mean now.

247
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,011
Jake Russell, when did
you get so spontaneous?

248
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,117
The day that I decided
you were the one for me.

249
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,472
Oh, maybe my personality
is rubbing off on you.

250
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:26,666
Come on, we've been trying
to set a date for this wedding

251
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,740
for months and something
always gets in the way.

252
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,398
What was the excuse last time?

253
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,149
Mercury in retrograde.

254
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:34,936
Okay, well, the calendar
that you gave me says...

255
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:37,292
"This is the perfect time
to forge new partnerships

256
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,601
and initiate long-term plans".

257
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,883
Does it really say all that? Hmm...

258
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:46,609
Jake, Christmas is only seven days away.

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,543
Not on Christmas.

260
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:52,811
On Christmas Eve.

261
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,902
Pull a wedding together in six days?

262
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,580
We'll get everybody to chip in.

263
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,561
Oh, so little time, so much fun.

264
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:03,041
Cassie, I want you to
wake up Christmas morning

265
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:05,083
with the family you've always wanted.

266
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:07,887
We're going to put the
magic back in Christmas

267
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,841
for you and the kids and George,

268
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,098
and on Christmas morning we'll
wake up one, big, happy family.

269
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,850
JAKE: We have some news.

270
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:20,471
We finally set a date for the wedding!

271
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,805
When is it going to be?

272
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,066
Christmas Eve.

273
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,151
- That's great!
- That's um...

274
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,860
Yeah, six days, I know.

275
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:28,397
Is it going to be at Grey House?

276
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,726
I would think Grey House is
going to be a little too cozy

277
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:31,971
for our guests.

278
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,122
We wouldn't want to leave anyone out.

279
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:37,373
Uh... can you get it together that fast?

280
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:38,703
We're going to need everyone's help.

282

Who wants to help me do some baking?

283
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,086
I do!

284
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,761
How 'bout you, George?

285
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:52,102
Uh, I'm feeling a little tired.

286
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,831
I think I'll take a nap.

287
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,694
It's going to be a perfect wedding.

288
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:01,184
- Yeah.
- A magical wedding.

I'm afraid we might need more than magic.

I think we may need a miracle.

you might use a little assistance.

00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,729
because this is no laughing matter.

329
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,855
I'm aware that Leon Deeks

330
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,752
is back in Middleton, Mayor Tinsdale.

331
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:47,971
What are you doing about it?

332
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,993
Well, first of all, we're
going to have to talk with

333
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,665
all the business owners in Middleton.

334
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:54,170
We do not want a repeat of
that Shelbyville Bank job

335
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:54,985
10 years ago.

336
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:56,419
No, sir, we do not.

337
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:57,904
That's why I'm keeping my eye on him.

338
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,343
24/7, Jake.

339
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,001
This town is flush with holiday cash.

340
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:04,080
For the next week,

341
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,931
Leon Deeks is your one and only priority.

342
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,276
CASSIE: A DJ for the reception?

343
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:19,595
What sort of music?

344
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:20,861
All sorts!

345
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:21,664
Yeah, that's right,

346
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,848
and any Christmas carols you can dance to.

347
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,338
Thank you!

348
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:32,161
Ah, dried sage, sprinkled sea salt...

349
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,162
spirit stones...

350
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:35,643
Hello, Derek.

351
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,795
You working on a potion?

352
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,771
No, making a list for the ceremony.

353
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:43,204
Well, just here on orders from the chief.

354
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,908
Going up and down the block.

355
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,639
Making sure that all
the shop keepers are...

356
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,811
being extra careful.

357
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,853
Hmm, is there cause for alarm?

358
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,479
No, just better to be safe than sorry.

359
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,460
Plus, it gets me out of the office.

360
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,258
And you can do your Christmas shopping.

361
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:57,357
Yeah.

362
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,281
Is there someone special
you're buying for this year?

363
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,907
A young lady, perhaps?

364
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,497
I wish.

365
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,092
You do? Hmm...

366
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,509
How can I help you with that?

367
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:07,827
Got a sister?

368
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,092
No, I'm afraid I don't.

369
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:12,933
Well, maybe I'll write a letter to Santa.

370
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,325
Now, that's the spirit.

371
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:18,140
Oh, and Derek, don't forget my pie plates.

372
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,422
I need them back.

373
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,610
So I can cook you up something new.

374
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:23,731
Right.

375
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:51,642
(Door opening)

376
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:55,529
There you are!

377
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,290
Come help me decorate the tree.

378
00:19:57,473 --> 00:20:00,137
Mom, why did you waste
your money on that thing?

379
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,236
Because it's Christmas.

380
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:07,047
Why don't you put the star on top?

381
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:08,965
Remember that?

382
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,297
How could I forget?

383
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:13,727
You made that when you were five years old.

384
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:16,348
With a lot of love.

385
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:19,007
Life was pretty nice back then.

386
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:21,263
A long time ago.

387
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:23,134
Sweetie...

388
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,890
(Knocking at door)

389
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,201
Merry Christmas, Ruth.

390
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:34,697
Leon...

391
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:42,325
Dad?

392
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,968
How you doing, angel?

393
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:49,015
You're so big.

394
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:50,652
Last time I saw you...

395
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:52,585
You were sentenced to 15 years?

396
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:54,670
Why are you here?

397
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:56,192
Well, I'm out.

398
00:20:57,552 --> 00:20:59,851
Got five years off for good behaviour.

399
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:02,633
Why are you here?

400
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,811
Why not? We're family, right?

401
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,239
We were.

402
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,247
Look, Ruth, that was a low
blow sending me divorce papers

403
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:13,222
while I was stuck in the pen.

404
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:15,792
But I forgive you.

405
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,903
You forgive me?

406
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:19,789
Yeah.

407
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:21,571
And to prove it,

408
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:23,823
I'm going to make this the biggest,

409
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,998
best Christmas our little girl ever had.

410
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:30,556
Jodi, if you could have
anything, anything at all...

411
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:31,592
what would it be?

412
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,453
I... I don't know.

413
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:36,235
Keep thinking about it
cause I'm getting it for you.

414
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:38,070
No.

415
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,874
You are out of my life,

416
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:42,734
and I am going to make
sure you stay out of Jodi's

417
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,130
- if I have to take you to court to do it.
- Mom!

418
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:47,385
- Hey, she's my daughter, too, alright?
- No.

419
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:49,586
Get out.

420
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,668
At least let the kid decide for herself.

421
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:55,638
Get out and don't you ever come back.

422
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:13,436
Oh, which of these
invitations do you prefer?

423
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:15,253
Uh, which one do you like?

424
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,341
- That one.
- Me, too.

425
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,396
Good.

426
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,351
And I have to run to the florist.

427
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:20,504
There's been a run on poinsettias,

428
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,041
but I think I can swing it.

429
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:23,771
We have a bigger problem than that.

430
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,012
I know, the golf course
and the VFW turned us down.

431
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:29,300
Cause they were both
nine months in advance.

432
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:31,296
But I think it'll all work out in the end.

433
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,075
Cassie, it's not about the venue.

434
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:34,373
It's about the marriage license.

435
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:36,578
They have new I.D. requirements,

436
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:38,992
and some of your records don't exist.

437
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:42,101
Yes, I suppose I have had a chequered past.

438
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:44,674
Well, I'm looking for the
court documents, but...

439
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,880
six days till Christmas and with
people gone for the holidays...

440
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,284
What are you saying?

441
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:51,572
I'm saying that unless we can prove

442
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:53,511
that you're Cassandra Nightingale...

443
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:57,043
We might have to postpone the wedding.

444

Hello, Betty.

449
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:40,787
Can I help you?

450
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:42,875
Um, I'm just looking.

451
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:44,768
Let me know if you need anything.

452
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:45,746
Okay.

453
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:49,382
What are you doing?

454
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:51,932
People come into the store
so stressed this time of year,

455
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:54,393
a little incense helps lighten the energy.

456
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:55,248
Hmm.

457
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,994
You know what? It smells really familiar.

458
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,923
Almost smells like...

459
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:01,763
Like what?

460
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,791
Like my apple ginger pie.

461
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:06,819
Mmm.

462
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,190
How is that even possible?

463
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,951
Oh, you'd be surprised at what's possible.

464
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:13,400
Hmm.

465
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,578
You know, I'm a big
fan of that pie of yours

466
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,611
and about a dozen other
things on your menu.

467
00:24:17,731 --> 00:24:19,888
I was wondering if...

468
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,619
if you could cater my wedding.

469
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:23,874
When is your big day?

470
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,089
Uh, Christmas Eve?

471
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:27,246
Oh!

472
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:29,200
That's a tall order.

473
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:31,102
But I'd love to.

474
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:33,347
Oh, I know how busy you
are this time of year.

475
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,573
Yeah, this season it's
always rush, rush, rush.

476
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:37,578
Right up until Christmas
finally arrives and

477
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:40,694
I can go home and relax
in my easy chair all day.

478
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,637
Alone.

479
00:24:49,469 --> 00:24:50,631
Oh, wow!

480
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,132
God that sparkles!

481
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,668
Oh yeah, I placed that there
to take advantage of the light.

482
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,266
Try it on.

483
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:02,939
Me? Oh, no, I...

484
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:05,331
I'm not really the type to wear jewellery.

485
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,582
Are you sure?

486
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,694
You know, I should probably
get back to the bake shop.

487

Merry Christmas, Martha.

What? Oh,

490
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:19,823
yes, I suppose it is.

491
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:22,538
Oh, and be sure to send me your
wedding menu as soon as you can.

492
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:23,789
I will.

493
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:26,473
Hello, Martha.

494
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:28,176
Miss Nightingale...

495
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:29,245
I have been

496
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:31,830
in and out of every shop on this street.

497
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,482
Oh, and not one bag to show for it!

498
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:35,264
Oh, I haven't been buying, I've been...

499
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:39,135
I've been so busy.

500
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:41,695
With the Citizen's League and the

501
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,113
Christmas Decorating Committee and

502
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:45,395
of course the Heritage Society, although,

503
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:47,880
thank goodness that's winding
down now for the holidays.

504
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,376
Well, you know, I've been busy, too.

505
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:50,658
I guess you heard the good news.

506
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:52,606
- The wedding. Congratulations!
- Yeah.

507
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:53,956
Thank you. I hope you can make it,

508
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:55,107
I know it's very last minute.

509
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,780
And Christmas Eve.

510
00:25:57,041 --> 00:26:00,173
The Mayor and I have several
long standing social obligations.

511
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:01,210
You understand.

512
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:04,097
Well, it would mean a lot
to me if you could be there.

513
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:10,351
You really know how to make
a party come alive, Martha.

514
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:11,346
I do?

515
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:15,911
Yes, I suppose I do.

516
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:19,194
Huh.

517
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,510
Make a party.

518
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,866
So can I count you in, then?

519
00:26:50,746 --> 00:26:51,955
Leon!

520
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:56,203
Jake Russell.

521
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:58,034
What, no backup?

522
00:26:58,036 --> 00:26:59,506
Tough guy.

523
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:01,174
Can I talk to you?

524
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:02,554
Yeah, go ahead talk.

525
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,274
What are you doing in Middleton?

526
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:06,421
I'm visiting my family.

527
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,168
You remember? The ones who have been

528
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:10,481
without a husband and a
father for the past 10 years?

529
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:12,782
- Thanks to you.
- I didn't rob a bank.

530
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:15,865
Still haven't found the money.

531
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:17,762
I told them where I hid that money.

532
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:19,007
It's in a warehouse in Shelbyville.

533
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,742
- Wasn't there.
- No?

534
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:23,743
It's not really the money that's
bothering you, is it, Chief?

535
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:26,601
What's bothering you is
the family you destroyed.

536
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,075
My family.

537
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,524
You did that on your own, Leon.

538
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:32,973
I was doing my duty.

539
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:36,361
Don't give me a reason to
send you back there again.

540
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,067
Yeah, don't worry about me, Jake.

541
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,745
Worry about yourself.

542
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:50,077
SANTA: Oh, thank you!

543
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,751
Mom's been kind of wired lately.

544
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,555
Maybe something to help
her, you know... chill.

545
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:03,037
Spa in a box.

546
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:06,131
Lavender bath oils, relaxing facial,

547
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,476
and magnetic stones to
place on her pressure points.

548
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:10,267
(Door opening)

549
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:12,284
I've got it!

550
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:13,915
I've got it!

551
00:28:14,351 --> 00:28:16,416
Got what, Martha? The Christmas spirit?

552
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:18,363
No, no, no, no! My new career.

553
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:21,460
I'm going to be a personal
wedding planner, and

554
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,979
you are my very first client.

555
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:26,468
Well, that is very
thoughtful of you, Martha.

556
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:33,327
I'll handle it all. Music,
menu, colour scheme...

557
00:28:33,366 --> 00:28:34,122
theme!

558
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:38,154
From your, wait for it,
12 drummers drumming,

559
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,519
to your partridge in a pear tree.

560
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,493
That sounds like you
have some very big plans.

561
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:43,665
They have to be big!

562
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,711
I expect potential clients to take notice

563
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,293
and hire me for future events!

564
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,879
Now, for the seven swans a-swimming,

565
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:52,387
I was thinking... ice sculptures!

566
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:53,397
(Chuckling nervously)

567
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,881
You know, I don't want
to dampen your enthusiasm,

568
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,519
- but how much is this going to cost?
- Not a penny.

569
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:01,701
I intend on working gratis.

570
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:04,743
It's only fair. It is my vision, after all.

571
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:06,762
Well, I have a vision, too.

572
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,345
So maybe we could have
a meeting of the minds.

573
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:10,727
Well, then, you need to make
some decisions immediately!

574
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:12,213
Luckily, I brought swatches.

575
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:13,761
Oh!

576
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:14,962
By the way,

577
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,238
I would keep my eye on her if I were you.

578
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:20,583
I believe she's Leon Deeks' daughter.

579
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:21,884
If you know what I mean.

580
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:23,850
(Door opening)

581
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,772
Hey, guys!

582
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:27,544
Hi, Lori!

583
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:29,029
Cassie...

584
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:35,091
Dad wants you to sign these so
he can get the marriage license.

585
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:38,708
Something about permission to
search for your birth records?

586
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,412
Getting married sure is complicated.

587
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,680
It takes so many people to
make it all come together.

588
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:54,651
Lori,

589
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:56,741
would you look after this?

590
00:29:57,898 --> 00:29:59,264
This is the ring

591
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:01,609
your father's going to
give me in the ceremony.

592
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:05,090
It belonged to my mother.

593
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:06,408
It's beautiful.

594
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:08,941
Yeah, it's one of the few
things I have of my mother's.

595
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:13,485
So I need you to take very good
care of it until the wedding.

596
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,201
You can count on me.

597
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,436
Oh, in that case, would you
watch the store for one minute?

598
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,488
I've got to run down and
pick up my wedding dress.

599
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:22,022
Dress? Oh, it has to be white!

600
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:23,888
It can't be off-white!

601
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,624
We can't have you clashing
with the ice sculptures!

602
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:28,271
Okay!

603
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:34,232
She acts like she's
the one getting married.

604
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:38,865
Okay. I think my mom's
really going to like this.

605
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,685
Speaking of gifts,

606
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:42,481
what are we going to
get Cassie for Christmas?

607
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:46,317
I don't know. She's so amazing,
the gift has to be amazing, too.

608
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:47,641
Yeah.

609
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:48,824
(Door opening, closing)

610
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,726
Hey, Jodi, any ideas for my new...

611
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:52,727
step-mom?

612
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,180
Where'd she go?

613
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:56,469
She must have stepped out.

614
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:03,108
Brandon, where's the ring?!

615
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:05,880
Beats me.

616
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:08,261
I left it right here on the counter!

617
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,508
It's gotta be here someplace, okay?

618
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:13,796
Where? It couldn't just disappear!

619
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:15,480
Lori...

620
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:17,184
We've got to find it.

621
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:18,398
What are we going to tell Cassie?

622
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,113
We're not going to tell Cassie!

623
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:22,917
She's got enough on her
mind. Just... keep looking!

624
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:55,762
(Brandon chatting, incoherent)

625
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:58,151
Oh! Hi, Brandon!

626
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,088
Hi, Jodi.

627
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:00,214
Lori,

628
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,706
what are you doing here?

629
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,648
I was just, uh...

630
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:07,616
going for a walk. You guys been shopping?

631
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:10,276
Yeah, I got my mom that spa in the box.

632
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,606
I was all set to buy it when
I saw her outside the shop.

633
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,843
So I cleared out fast.

634
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:16,510
Better go hide this under my bed.

635
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,692
Bye, Brandon.

636
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,288
I know why you're here.

637
00:32:26,017 --> 00:32:28,166
You came over to accuse
Jodi of taking the ring.

638
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:29,791
No!

639
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:31,722
Thought maybe she stole it, right?

640
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:33,254
Because of who her dad is?

641
00:32:33,462 --> 00:32:35,802
Lori, I want to find it, too...
- Brandon, I...

642
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:38,086
You're as bad as Martha Tinsdale!

643
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,283
What's wrong, honey?

644
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:48,925
What do you mean?

645
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:51,062
Well, for one thing, you
haven't complained once

646
00:32:51,084 --> 00:32:53,381
about doing all this
Christmas shopping with me.

647
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:56,039
- I got a lot of things on my mind.
- The wedding.

648
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,583
That and what happens after.

649
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:00,374
I'm moving out.

650
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:05,933
To make room for the newlyweds.
George, you're such a romantic.

651
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,875
That's why I fell for you.

652
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,808
This is your chance to start a new life.

653
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:13,734
Ask yourself, "What does
George O'Hanrahan want?"

654
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,738
More than anything?

655
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,099
To put these packages down.
My arms are killing me.

You know I'm leaving
for San Diego tomorrow.

You had to remind me.

I'm going to miss you, Gwen.

Oh, I'm going to miss you, too.

Why would she know?

Because she was right next

And I never said she stole it!

It's what I need, a hike.

Why are you angry with your sister?

Cause she accused Jodi of being a thief!

748
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:52,320
According to Lori, she
never said a word to Jodi.

749
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,769
She was going to.

750
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:56,553
I guess Lori thinks that
just because Jodi's dad

751
00:37:56,564 --> 00:37:58,276
robbed a bank it runs in the family.

752

Well, Lori's very upset.
About the ring and you.

And Brandon, Jodi was
right beside that ring

754

when it disappeared.

755
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:07,379
You know, the whole town's against her.

756
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:09,425
They think she's some sort of gangster.

Hi, uh...

763
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,177
maybe this isn't the best time.

764
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,380
No, there's no time like the present.

765
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,061
Alright, well, uh...

766
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,864
I have the flow of the ceremony.

767
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:36,297
I have to get a copy of this
to the minister, except...

768
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:37,302
Except what?

769
00:38:37,422 --> 00:38:39,600
Well, I'm having trouble finding one.

770
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,668
Sometimes I wonder if all
of this is going to work out.

771
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,480
Oh, it will. Trust me!

772
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:47,442
We'll find a minister and a venue,

773
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:49,089
and we'll get our license.

774
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,353
No, not that, Cassie.

775
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,786
I got Brandon mad at me,
he's fighting with his sister.

776
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,277
Lori's upset.

777
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,260
And George...

778

he's feeling like he just
wants to get away from us all.

I just want to give
everyone a family Christmas.

780
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:06,951
It's hard to have a family Christmas

781
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:09,652
when you don't have a happy
family to celebrate it.

782

Hi, thank you.

Oh. Wait till you try your wedding cake.

787
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,227
Oh, that reminds me!

788
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:40,258
You're going to have to sample
some of that sparkling wine

789
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:41,564
before I order it.

790
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:44,928
Betty, um...

791
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:48,525
Every woman deserves a
little sparkle in her life.

792
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:50,918
I want you to have this.

793
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:53,359
A gift? Cassie, I couldn't...

794
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:55,772
Oh, look at all those
gifts. You deserve one, too.

795
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:57,249
Oh...

796
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:58,617
It is pretty, but...

797
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:00,176
It's not really my style.

798
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,521
Well, I'll tell you what.
Try it for a few days,

799
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:04,586
and if you don't like it, I'll exchange it.

800
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:07,233
You don't have to do that.

801
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:10,433
Customer satisfaction is my priority.

802
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:13,907
If you insist.

803
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:16,039
- I'll go get the wine.
- Okay.

804
00:40:19,364 --> 00:40:20,664
Yoo-hoo!

805
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,381
Season's greetings!

806
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:25,278
Oh, well, fashionably late, as usual.

807
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:27,962
- Martha, you shouldn't have.
- What?

808
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:30,561
I didn't. Your gift is on back order.

809
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:35,586
Voilà!

810
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,235
Partridges in a pear tree!

811
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,602
Wow. Do we need that?

812
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:46,945
Oh, we need several of
them. One for each table.

813
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,087
Oh, even the menu isn't that grand, Martha.

814
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:51,554
Yeah, Betty's right.
I ordered comfort food.

815
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:54,070
Oh, wedding's aren't about
comfort, for goodness sake.

816
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:55,815
If they were, people would be
getting married all the time.

817
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:57,807
Oh, I ordered your cake.

818
00:40:57,927 --> 00:40:59,878
Five tiers!

819
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:01,695
CASSIE: Oh, uh...

820
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:03,544
Betty's doing the cake.

821
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:05,916
Oh! Really?

822
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,444
What kind?

823
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:10,901
Well, we decided perhaps
a yellow sheet cake.

824
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:13,385
Sheet cake?

825
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:14,950
(Giggling, snorting)

826
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,361
Oh, my dear Betty.

827
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:19,610
Cassie's cake has to be at
least as tall as the pear trees.

828
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,638
Am I right?

829
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,439
Why don't we let Betty do the cake?

830
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:24,911
MARTHA: I see.

831
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:26,738
Well, it's your funeral.

832
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:28,324
Oops, I mean wedding.

833
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:31,950
Martha, I so appreciate all you've done.

834
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:34,072
Do you? Do any of you?

835
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:36,216
I had a vision.

836
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:39,941
Nine ladies dancing, eight
lords a-leaping, and...

837
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:43,065
Well, a sheet cake would just
compromise the entire affair.

838
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,756
I mean, who would hire
me after that got around?

839
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,444
Nope, I'm afraid that I am
going to have to bow out.

840
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:51,489
I'm sorry to hear that, Martha.

841
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,356
Well, I couldn't have attended anyway.

842
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:57,293
I have a previous engagement!

843
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:05,006
Ho, ho, ho.

844
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:08,238
Ooh, you're feeling jolly as well, huh?

845
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:10,098
How can we have a Merry Christmas

846
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,553
if everyone's so miserable?

847
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:13,079
Everybody?

848
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:15,098
- Well, my family anyway.
- Hmm.

849
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:16,695
Including you?

850
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:18,391
Guess so.

851
00:42:18,511 --> 00:42:19,655
Why?

852
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,499
Because...

853
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,233
I don't have the...

854
00:42:26,523 --> 00:42:27,759
A dress.

855
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:29,203
For the wedding.

856
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:32,272
The one I wanted was too small.

857
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:34,826
Well, why don't we have it let out?

858
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:39,274
We're all constantly growing.

859
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:40,735
Aren't we, Lori?

860
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:46,002
Yeah, what's the rate on that room?

861
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,027
That much? Um...

862
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,538
Nothing lower?

863
00:42:51,723 --> 00:42:54,026
I thought for some reason, um,

864
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:55,574
rooms would be lower in Montreal.

865
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:58,584
I guess not.

866
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:00,387
Thanks.

867
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:04,951
(Sighing)

868
00:43:05,464 --> 00:43:08,729
Brandon. I didn't hear you come in.

869
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,054
Montreal?

870
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:13,394
Yeah, um, a friend of mine
has a restaurant up there.

871
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:14,678
Cool.

872
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:17,096
I thought I'd go for...

873
00:43:17,353 --> 00:43:18,849
For a visit.

874
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:22,182
A long visit.

875
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:25,978
(Knocking)

876
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:30,602
- Hello?
- Mrs. Deeks, hi, I'm Cassie Nightingale.

877
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,975
- We spoke on the phone?
- Of course, please come in.

878
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:34,275
Thanks.

879
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:37,400
Rumour has it you're the best
seamstress in all of Middleton.

880
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,849
Thank you.

881
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:40,838
I have a little emergency.

882
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,179
Uh...

883
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,653
Can you let this out two inches?

884
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:47,095
It's a very delicate material.

885
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:49,296
- Is there enough fabric?
- Let me see.

886
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:52,236
- Yes, I can do it.
- Oh, you're a life saver!

887
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:54,520
Listen, I know you have
this colour thread upstairs.

888
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:56,051
If you want to wait, it'll
only take a few minutes.

889
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,595
- Perfect!
- Please make yourself at home.

890
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:58,338
Thanks.

891
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:01,938
JODI CALLING: Dad?

892
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:05,001
Oh...

893
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:07,576
Sorry, I heard voices and thought...

894
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,077
No, it's just me.

895
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,079
Your mom's fixing a dress for me.

896
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:15,691
She is going to love that spa in a box.

897
00:44:15,712 --> 00:44:16,806
Oh, yes! You know what?

898
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:19,022
I forgot to give you
something the other day.

899
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:26,981
A coin?

900
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:29,701
It's a gift.

901
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:31,932
A dollar.

902
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:34,476
- Thanks.
- It's a silver dollar.

903
00:44:35,594 --> 00:44:37,775
Is it worth more than a regular dollar?

904
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,740
Well, that depends on how you spend it.

905
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,292
Ho, ho, ho!

906
00:44:57,352 --> 00:45:00,180
Merry Christmas, Middleton!

907
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:02,456
Merry Christmas.

908
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,098
Ho, ho, ho... oh!

909
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:06,816
That's the spirit.

910
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,289
And a prosperous new year to you.

911
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,348
And to all of us.

912
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:15,218
It's only two days till Christmas,

913
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,684
and I still don't know what to get you.

914
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:17,841
That's okay.

915
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:19,753
I was going to make you
this Christmas ornament,

916
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:21,212
but... pretty lame, huh?

917
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:22,941
Brandon...

918
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,146
I'm sure I'd like just about
anything if it came from you.

919
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,451
Yeah, but...

920
00:45:29,758 --> 00:45:31,016
What do you really want?

921
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,846
I, uh... don't think there's much chance

922
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:42,756
I'll get what I really want for Christmas.

923
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:45,546
SANTA: Ho, ho, ho!

924
00:45:46,065 --> 00:45:47,728
Happy holidays to you!

925
00:45:47,793 --> 00:45:49,576
Oh, thank you.

926
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:50,730
Got any change?

927
00:45:50,774 --> 00:45:52,010
Oh, uh...

928
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,038
Just this.

929
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:55,966
Oh, nice coin.

930
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,607
What's it worth?

931
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,752
A dollar?

932
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:01,778
Maybe it's worth something.

933
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:02,829
I don't know.

934
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:05,428
Maybe it'll make somebody have
a better Christmas than me.

935
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:08,043
Merry Christmas, Santa.

936
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,992
Jodi?

937
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:13,052
KID: Mommy, there's Santa!

938
00:46:13,368 --> 00:46:15,804
Can we please say hi to Santa?

939
00:46:15,821 --> 00:46:17,697
What a sweet family.

940
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:20,564
Merry Christmas, Santa.

941
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:23,026
Merry Christmas!

942
00:46:23,077 --> 00:46:25,299
Thanks, Santa. See ya.

943
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:26,933
- KID: Bye, Santa!
- Merry Christmas.

944
00:46:28,403 --> 00:46:30,393
Merry Christmas.

945
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:56,511
Yes, I'm making truffles
for the wedding guests.

946
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:58,733
So if you could just double that order...

947
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:02,603
Yes, I know it is a lot of chocolate

948
00:47:02,616 --> 00:47:04,017
but as I always say,

949
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:05,898
you can never have too much love

950
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:07,235
or chocolate.

951
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:09,271
Oh, thank you so much.

952
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:10,835
Hello, Derek.

953
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:12,438
- Hi.
- Keeping our streets safe?

954
00:47:12,558 --> 00:47:13,900
Thanks to you.

955
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:16,259
Getting Leon in a Santa suit?

956
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:18,370
How did you manage to do that?

957
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,532
Never underestimate the magic of Santa.

958
00:47:24,498 --> 00:47:26,515
- I have your pie plates.
- Oh,

959
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,421
- how'd you like the mince pie?
- Loved it.

960
00:47:29,762 --> 00:47:32,437
Well, I'm ready for my next treat.

961
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:34,805
(Door opening)

962
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:38,181
Evening, ma'am.

963
00:47:38,301 --> 00:47:40,753
Oh, Deputy, it's me. Betty.

964
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,728
Betty!

965
00:47:42,848 --> 00:47:45,335
Listen, I wanted to
ask you about your cake.

966
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:46,394
Which frosting?

967
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:47,608
Beautiful.

968
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:49,836
Oh, yes, it's going to be beautiful.

969
00:47:49,863 --> 00:47:51,733
But I want to know which flavour.

970
00:47:51,853 --> 00:47:53,779
No, I meant you!

971
00:47:53,899 --> 00:47:57,345
Oh, well... thank you!

972
00:47:58,106 --> 00:48:00,360
BETTY: You know, after a
day of wearing this necklace,

973
00:48:00,391 --> 00:48:02,345
I just had to go buy a
new dress to go with it.

974
00:48:02,356 --> 00:48:04,593
And then I had to buy new
shoes to go with the new dress,

975
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:07,268
and then I got a new haircut
to match my new outfit,

976
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,358
and before I knew it,
I had a total make-over.

977
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,846
It's amazing how this little necklace

978
00:48:11,868 --> 00:48:13,635
inspired a whole new me.

979
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:14,904
Not new.

980
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,928
The outer sparkle just helped

981
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,001
your inner sparkle shine through.

982
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:21,753
I'll say.

983
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:25,577
I'll say chocolate frosting.

984
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:27,858
Not that it's my cake, but,

985
00:48:27,912 --> 00:48:30,089
you know, I'm sure
whatever cake you make is...

986
00:48:30,686 --> 00:48:31,938
is going to be great.

987
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,961
Thank you, Derek.

988
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:40,033
Um... I'm going to go back to my bake shop.

989
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:42,046
I'll, uh, I'll walk you.

990
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,562
Okay.

991
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:46,325
Say, what are you doing Christmas Day?

992
00:48:46,713 --> 00:48:48,994
(Mouthing)

993
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:19,878
Cassie, you're really
doing a good job on those.

994
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:21,169
Thank you.

995
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:22,741
Mmm, thanks.

996
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:26,348
Mmm.

997
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:29,527
I got our wedding license.

998
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:32,997
What?! That's terrific! Really?

999
00:49:33,408 --> 00:49:35,468
- How?
- I just told the county clerk

1000
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:37,297
that you'd been paying
state and federal taxes

1001
00:49:37,314 --> 00:49:39,065
under the name Cassandra
Nightingale for years

1002
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:41,313
and that if it was good enough
for the Internal Revenue Service

1003
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:42,779
then who were they to say otherwise?

1004
00:49:42,828 --> 00:49:45,109
Brilliant! We're on a roll!

1005
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:47,664
Now all we have to do is figure
out a place to have the wedding.

1006
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:49,551
Well, what happened to the garden club?

1007
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:52,274
Well, they won't let us use
their solarium for the wedding.

1008
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:54,571
Something about the
body heat from the guests

1009
00:49:54,588 --> 00:49:56,283
wilting the lilies.

1010
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:57,645
That's ridiculous!

1011
00:49:57,765 --> 00:49:59,466
Well, they've got a point.

1012
00:50:00,002 --> 00:50:01,226
You and I have a way of

1013
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:03,755
raising the temperature all by ourselves.

1014
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:08,596
Jake...

1015
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:09,625
lighten up!

1016
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,010
Sorry, it's just...

1017
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,345
It's Christmas.

1018
00:50:13,613 --> 00:50:16,288
Everything's either booked
or closed for the holidays.

1019
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:18,979
Well, not to worry.

1020
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,117
I have a plan.

1021
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:22,201
Yeah, you always do.

1022
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:24,553
I also have our minister.

1023
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:27,003
He's happy to drive down from Lakeville.

1024
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:28,830
Apparently he and George go way back.

1025
00:50:29,054 --> 00:50:30,783
Yeah, George...

1026
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,339
He's talking about moving.

1027
00:50:32,341 --> 00:50:33,641
To Montreal.

1028
00:50:33,643 --> 00:50:35,432
He's got a friend that
owns a restaurant there.

1029
00:50:35,454 --> 00:50:37,035
What? But...

1030
00:50:37,155 --> 00:50:38,530
You and the kids have to get together

1031
00:50:38,556 --> 00:50:40,048
and figure out a way to talk him out of it.

1032
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:41,909
Cassie, we're not even talking.

1033
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,024
Well, I've got to get back to work.

1034
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:57,076
Why don't you stop for a cup of
coffee on your way to keep warm?

1035
00:51:02,857 --> 00:51:04,250
What?

1036
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,925
What's that smile about?

1037
00:51:06,216 --> 00:51:08,840
I just remembered that I'm
marrying you on Christmas Eve.

1038
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,435
Just a coffee, please.

1039
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:25,249
Betty!

1040
00:51:25,743 --> 00:51:28,247
Just the usual, Chief Russell?

1041
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:31,460
Yes. The, uh...

1042
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,909
Okay.

1043
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:38,811
Well.

1044
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:41,717
Is this seat taken?

1045
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,367
It is now, I guess.

1046
00:51:46,487 --> 00:51:48,126
Brandon...

1047
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,093
You can't still be mad at me.

1048
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:51,570
Why not?

1049
00:51:51,596 --> 00:51:53,363
You still think Jodi's a thief.

1050
00:51:53,365 --> 00:51:54,877
I never said that.

1051
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,518
It's tough on Jodi.

1052
00:51:57,057 --> 00:51:59,254
She has such a big heart.

1053
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:02,826
She hides it cause she
has this rep around school.

1054
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:05,509
All because her dad was in prison.

1055
00:52:08,263 --> 00:52:10,151
You know, I was beginning
to think that you were

1056
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:12,143
very close-minded. But you're not.

1057
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,844
Not when it comes to your friend.

1058
00:52:16,621 --> 00:52:19,066
She's funny. And fun, you know?

1059
00:52:19,382 --> 00:52:20,972
The things she says,

1060
00:52:20,989 --> 00:52:22,715
the way she dresses.

1061
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:24,349
She's different.

1062
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:25,717
In a good way.

1063
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:29,114
That's why I like her so much.

1064
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,084
Who does that remind you of?

1065
00:52:31,405 --> 00:52:32,424
Huh?

1066
00:52:32,738 --> 00:52:34,680
Your friend, Jodi.

1067
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:37,744
She sounds an awful lot like
the woman that I'm gonna marry.

1068
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:40,513
For all the same reasons.

1069
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:46,011
Christmas special?

1070
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,660
Mm-hmm.

1071
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,665
They, uh... top it with
red and green sprinkles.

1072
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:52,848
Ah.

1073
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:54,996
Well, you let me pay for that.

1074
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:56,856
Cassie already did.

1075
00:52:57,246 --> 00:52:58,627
Really?

1076
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,493
Yeah.

1077
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:02,093
She sent me down here.

1078
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:04,295
Said I deserved a treat.

1079
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:19,857
So, what brings you here, George?

1080
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:22,417
- My feet.
- (Chuckling)

1081
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,622
I was just out for a long walk,

1082
00:53:24,647 --> 00:53:26,767
and I thought I'd knock on your door.

1083
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,493
Is this herbal tea?

1084
00:53:29,536 --> 00:53:32,108
No, something stronger. Irish breakfast.

1085
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:34,655
Oh. How'd you guess Mr. O'Hanrahan

1086
00:53:34,663 --> 00:53:36,099
would be paying you a visit?

1087
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,927
I always feel welcome here.

1088
00:53:39,577 --> 00:53:41,432
Hmm, Grey House.

1089
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,483
Dear old Grey House.

1090
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:45,833
Something wrong, Cassie?

1091
00:53:46,064 --> 00:53:49,680
Oh, it's just an old house
and it needs a lot of TLC.

1092
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:50,927
It's a big responsibility.

1093
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,645
Well, you're up to it.

1094
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:56,063
After the wedding, Jake and I
will be staying at his house,

1095
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:57,995
and I can't be two places at once.

1096
00:53:58,448 --> 00:53:59,593
Are you sure?

1097
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:01,468
- Now, George...
- (Both chuckling)

1098
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:05,516
Hmm... maybe running a B&B is...

1099
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:07,069
a hands-on job.

1100
00:54:08,074 --> 00:54:10,074
And half the time I won't be here.

1101
00:54:10,194 --> 00:54:13,010
Oh, I want to hold on to Grey House, but...

1102
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:16,443
But without the B&B income,
I'm just not so sure anymore.

1103
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:21,215
Ah, but I've been doing
all the talking. So...

1104
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,349
is there something on your mind?

1105
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:26,275
Oh, nothing.

1106
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:28,970
It's funny how, uh...

1107
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:32,101
a long walk sometimes will clear your mind.

1108
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,789
Want a cup of coffee, Chief?

1109
00:55:02,277 --> 00:55:03,935
No, thanks.

1110
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:06,362
Are you sure? You look a little tired.

1111
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:08,430
I'm fine.

1112
00:55:08,747 --> 00:55:11,063
- You working overtime?
- Yeah.

1113
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:13,559
You've been out here almost every day.

1114
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:15,465
Yeah, that's right.

1115
00:55:15,739 --> 00:55:17,585
Except tomorrow.

1116
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,590
Cause you're getting married.

1117
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:23,029
I got that covered, too, Leon.

1118
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:26,620
Yeah, I bet you do.

1119
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,423
Well, we'll see you around, huh?

1120
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:45,938
Ho, ho, ho!

1121
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:47,938
Merry Christmas!

1122
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:50,946
Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!

1123
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:53,211
Thank you very much.

1124
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,210
Got the dress! It's all fixed up!

1125
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,475
And ready for the big night.

1126
00:56:12,715 --> 00:56:15,621
Oh. Thanks.

1127
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:19,535
It's not about the dress, is it?

1128
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,372
Lori, you can tell me anything.

1129
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:29,091
I don't have the ring.

1130
00:56:30,852 --> 00:56:35,196
I lost it. You gave it to
me, you trusted me, and...

1131
00:56:36,715 --> 00:56:38,604
I let you down.

1132
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:41,185
Oh, honey. No tears.

1133
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:42,621
Okay?

1134
00:56:42,647 --> 00:56:45,065
But you told me it belonged to your mother.

1135
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:47,655
You said it was all you had
left from your old family!

1136
00:56:47,698 --> 00:56:49,442
(Crying)

1137
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:51,151
I have my memories.

1138
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:53,741
And those can never be lost.

1139
00:56:55,698 --> 00:56:57,690
And now,

1140
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:00,143
I have my new family, too.

1141
00:57:00,981 --> 00:57:03,715
So let me tell you something
about that old ring.

1142
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:08,099
It has a mind of its own.

1143
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,578
Huh?

1144
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:12,860
I've misplaced it before and that ring...

1145
00:57:12,894 --> 00:57:15,492
always finds its way back to me.

1146
00:57:26,983 --> 00:57:28,453
MARTHA: Oh.

1147
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,547
- Hello, Miss Nightingale.
- Hello, Martha.

1148
00:57:33,428 --> 00:57:35,811
If you've come to ask
me back, I'm afraid...

1149
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:37,408
Well, I didn't come for that.

1150
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:38,338
I was wondering if you had

1151
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:40,224
those colour swatches that you showed me.

1152
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,163
I might.

1153
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:46,930
I was ordering table cloths,

1154
00:57:46,944 --> 00:57:49,129
and there was this one shade of ivory...

1155
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:51,509
Oh, yes, here it is.

1156
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:52,185
Yes!

1157
00:57:53,302 --> 00:57:54,706
What on Earth is this?

1158
00:57:56,926 --> 00:57:58,508
My ring!

1159
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:02,281
How did it get in there?

1160
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:05,944
Well, what matters is you
found it, Martha thank you!

1161
00:58:06,064 --> 00:58:07,708
Heavens that day in your shop.

1162
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:10,057
I emptied my purse on your counter

1163
00:58:10,215 --> 00:58:12,105
and after I swept everything up again

1164
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:13,051
I must have...

1165
00:58:16,123 --> 00:58:17,846
I feel just terrible!

1166
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:21,128
You're not... angry?

1167
00:58:21,653 --> 00:58:22,982
Of course not.

1168
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,702
I suppose I shouldn't
have quit on you like that.

1169
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,934
Leaving you high and dry
at the very last minute? Oh,

1170
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,384
I had such an extraordinary event

1171
00:58:32,406 --> 00:58:33,773
planned for the two of you.

1172
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:34,840
I know!

1173
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,033
That's why I recommended
you to a wealthy client

1174
00:58:37,044 --> 00:58:38,461
who's getting married in the spring.

1175
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:39,446
You did?

1176
00:58:39,495 --> 00:58:42,399
You have such energy,
Martha, and enthusiasm.

1177
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:44,428
You're bursting with creative ideas!

1178
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:45,434
(Giggling)

1179
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:47,081
And I think the job pays well, too.

1180
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:50,483
What a lovely, unexpected gesture.

1181
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:51,954
Why unexpected?

1182
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:54,361
Well, for you to think
of me after all that I...

1183
00:58:55,455 --> 00:58:57,791
Well, it is the season where
we think of others first,

1184
00:58:57,835 --> 00:58:58,770
don't we?

1185
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:02,003
I don't know what to say!

1186
00:59:02,402 --> 00:59:05,695
I know you and the Mayor have
other plans for Christmas Eve.

1187
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,282
But the invitation is still open.

1188
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:10,224
After all that I've done?

1189
00:59:10,454 --> 00:59:12,811
Ah, but there's so much
more to do, isn't there?

1190
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:19,288
Well, if your plans change...

1191
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,710
we'd love to see you there.

1192
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:23,221
Merry Christmas, Martha.

1193
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,645
And to you.

1194
00:59:31,558 --> 00:59:32,701
Brandon!

1195
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,704
Cassie found her ring.

1196
00:59:36,257 --> 00:59:37,498
That's good.

1197
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,415
So now you must feel just great.

1198
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:43,111
Pretty good.

1199
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,287
Not great.

1200
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:45,692
Why not?

1201
00:59:46,398 --> 00:59:48,562
I went to see Jodi behind your back.

1202
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:51,403
Maybe I should have just told
you what was bothering me.

1203
00:59:51,753 --> 00:59:53,600
That's what big brothers are for, right?

1204
00:59:54,395 --> 00:59:56,556
You're more than my brother, right?

1205
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,339
You're my friend.

1206
00:59:59,072 --> 00:59:59,958
Aren't you?

1207
01:00:00,423 --> 01:00:01,380
Yeah.

1208
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,781
Yeah, I am.

1209
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:07,462
Maybe I didn't act like one, though.

1210
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,619
Sorry.

1211
01:00:26,732 --> 01:00:29,108
Official wedding photographer,
reporting for duty.

1212
01:00:29,518 --> 01:00:31,091
Look at you!

1213
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,740
Wow!

1214
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:36,056
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1215
01:00:37,355 --> 01:00:38,629
Where's Jodi?

1216
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:40,269
I'm going to go get her.

1217
01:00:40,996 --> 01:00:42,859
I hope she has a good time tonight.

1218
01:00:42,979 --> 01:00:45,662
- Christmas is never much fun for her.
- Hmm.

1219
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:47,611
Never say never.

1220
01:00:48,987 --> 01:00:51,646
- Where are you going?
- Oh, down to the shop.

1221
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:54,287
Don't you have a wedding to get to?

1222
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:56,175
Yeah, I forgot my sage.

1223
01:00:56,226 --> 01:00:57,730
Jodi and I could get it for you.

1224
01:00:57,756 --> 01:01:00,106
- Would you?
- Yeah, it's on the way.

1225
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:01,714
Oh, thanks!

1226
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:03,979
Alright, just a small bunch of dried sage.

1227
01:01:04,026 --> 01:01:05,886
I want to burn a little
before the ceremony.

1228
01:01:06,006 --> 01:01:07,104
Clear the air.

1229
01:01:07,343 --> 01:01:09,401
Make way for new beginnings.

1230
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:13,360
Here you go.

1231
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:14,775
Okay.

1232
01:01:18,078 --> 01:01:20,109
(Door closing)

1233
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:28,134
Cassie?

1234
01:01:28,138 --> 01:01:29,647
About your cake...

1235
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:31,691
I am so sorry.

1236
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:33,599
Um, it was in the back of my van,

1237
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:36,149
and unfortunately, so was
my neighbour's dachshund...

1238
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:37,267
Oh, no!

1239
01:01:37,387 --> 01:01:40,121
Yeah! This tiny dog ate the entire thing!

1240
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:42,418
Now I am trying to get you another one,

1241
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:44,130
but I am totally sold out.

1242
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,572
And every other bakery from
here to the state capitol

1243
01:01:46,574 --> 01:01:47,528
closed at noon.

1244
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:49,016
Betty, put it out of your mind.

1245
01:01:49,136 --> 01:01:51,152
You get back to all the
other items on your menu.

1246
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:52,824
But it's your wedding cake!

1247
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:54,036
What'll we do?!

1248
01:01:54,941 --> 01:01:56,981
Well, the first thing to realize is that...

1249
01:01:57,352 --> 01:02:00,320
baking is about mixing
together the right ingredients.

1250
01:02:02,716 --> 01:02:04,588
I have no idea what you're saying.

1251
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,665
Then look at it this way:

1252
01:02:06,877 --> 01:02:09,407
you just brought great joy
to a dachshund this Christmas.

1253
01:02:19,185 --> 01:02:21,617
(Dialling)

1254
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:24,922
(Phone ringing)

1255
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:25,708
Hello?

1256
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,165
<i>CASSIE: Hello, George?</i>

1257
01:02:27,397 --> 01:02:30,058
Um, do you have cake mix?

1258
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:31,179
(Chuckling)

1259
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,485
I'll have to check... why?

1260
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:35,651
Well, I need a wedding cake for 35 guests

1261
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:37,715
in, um... two hours.

1262
01:02:39,779 --> 01:02:41,072
Uh, George?

1263
01:02:41,092 --> 01:02:42,419
I'm here, uh...

1264
01:02:42,614 --> 01:02:45,414
A little shocked, but I'm still standing.

1265
01:02:46,336 --> 01:02:49,460
Maybe Lori could help
you move things along?

1266
01:02:50,255 --> 01:02:52,223
<i>I'm counting on you two.</i>

1267
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:54,835
<i>GEORGE: Okay...</i>

1268
01:02:55,326 --> 01:02:56,606
Great.

1269
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:01,906
Do you know how to tie one of these?

1270
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:03,513
George?

1271
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,689
Are you there?

1272
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:06,790
Was that Cassie?

1273
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:09,059
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

1274
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:10,961
What does she want?

1275
01:03:11,894 --> 01:03:13,145
A miracle.

1276
01:03:15,933 --> 01:03:17,867
(Cell phone ringing)

1277
01:03:20,538 --> 01:03:21,843
Derek?

1278
01:03:22,116 --> 01:03:24,195
<i>Chief, I found Leon's car.</i>

1279
01:03:24,236 --> 01:03:25,638
<i>But I can't find him!</i>

1280
01:03:25,644 --> 01:03:28,345
Okay, stay on Main Street,

1281
01:03:28,557 --> 01:03:30,144
stay with the car.

1282
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,782
As long as you have the
car, he's not going anywhere.

1283
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:33,760
You got it?

1284
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,285
<i>Copy that, Jake.</i>

1285
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:39,292
No cake mix?

1286
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:41,172
Even if we had all the ingredients,

1287
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,280
there's not enough time.

1288
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,755
Hey, I know it looks impossible,

1289
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:44,661
but don't forget you've got

1290
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,528
George "Never Say Die"
O'Hanrahan in your corner!

1291
01:03:49,677 --> 01:03:51,362
So, what are you going to do?

1292
01:03:52,486 --> 01:03:53,459
Beats me.

1293
01:03:54,026 --> 01:03:55,294
(Cell phone ringing)

1294
01:03:55,296 --> 01:03:56,561
Derek?

1295
01:03:57,677 --> 01:03:58,880
Oh.

1296
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:00,709
Yeah, hi.

1297
01:04:01,063 --> 01:04:02,018
How are you?

1298
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,548
Really?

1299
01:04:05,668 --> 01:04:07,467
You don't have any other way to...

1300
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:08,989
No?

1301
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,917
No, it's not your fault, no.

1302
01:04:13,536 --> 01:04:14,713
Merry Christmas.

1303
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,374
I hate to ask.

1304
01:04:19,987 --> 01:04:21,562
That was the minister.

1305
01:04:21,682 --> 01:04:24,127
His car broke down, he has
no other way to get here.

1306
01:04:24,247 --> 01:04:26,298
Maybe Derek could shoot
up there in the squad car?

1307
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:27,742
No, Derek's on duty.

1308
01:04:27,803 --> 01:04:29,964
Even if he could drive 100 miles an hour,

1309
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:32,362
it's a round trip he'd
still never make it on time.

1310
01:04:32,393 --> 01:04:34,130
Well, ask people to wait.

1311
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:36,034
Maybe we can serve them these cookies.

1312
01:04:36,244 --> 01:04:39,499
Oh, honey, we can't do that to
people. Not on Christmas Eve.

1313
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,517
What good is a marriage license

1314
01:04:43,637 --> 01:04:45,924
if we don't have a
minister to tie the knot?

1315
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:52,388
Robert Kowalski and Teresa Quinn?

1316
01:04:52,508 --> 01:04:53,740
- Who?
- Who?

1317
01:04:54,585 --> 01:04:56,252
The names on your wedding license.

1318
01:04:58,703 --> 01:05:00,611
Well, they must have
given me the wrong one!

1319
01:05:01,412 --> 01:05:03,590
I've been so busy, I didn't
even bother to open it!

1320
01:05:03,795 --> 01:05:04,628
Jake...

1321
01:05:04,658 --> 01:05:05,721
That's it.

1322
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:07,279
The wedding's off.

1323
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,899
No, it can't be!

1324
01:05:09,498 --> 01:05:11,109
I'll have to speak to Cassie.

1325
01:05:13,972 --> 01:05:15,533
Do you know this would be the first promise

1326
01:05:15,563 --> 01:05:16,771
I've ever broken to her?

1327
01:05:20,978 --> 01:05:22,979
(Upbeat music playing)

1328
01:06:33,538 --> 01:06:34,906
BRANDON IN DISTANCE: Only be a minute.

1329
01:06:34,906 --> 01:06:36,538
JODI IN DISTANCE: Oh, no problem.

1330
01:06:47,624 --> 01:06:49,709
She said a small bunch of dried sage.

1331
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:52,379
Hanging from the ceilings.

1332
01:06:52,722 --> 01:06:56,370
JODI: Um, don't most people
usually hang mistletoe?

1333
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,849
Cassie says it makes
way for new beginnings.

1334
01:07:02,157 --> 01:07:04,328
I wish my family could
make a new beginning.

1335
01:07:06,525 --> 01:07:07,824
What do you mean?

1336
01:07:08,721 --> 01:07:11,798
You're so lucky to have your
family and a dad like Jake.

1337
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:13,114
I used to.

1338
01:07:13,593 --> 01:07:15,337
When I was little, ten years ago.

1339
01:07:16,773 --> 01:07:18,764
You remember that far back?

1340
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:21,088
Like it was yesterday.

1341
01:07:21,668 --> 01:07:23,535
Me and my dad laughing...

1342
01:07:23,655 --> 01:07:26,638
I'd stand on his shoes and
he'd waltz me around the room.

1343
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:30,080
I keep those memories up here.

1344
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,405
Locked away like treasure.

1345
01:07:32,772 --> 01:07:34,849
I take them out at
night before I go to bed,

1346
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:38,268
and that's why I remember him so well.

1347
01:07:53,017 --> 01:07:55,086
Do you want to go to the party now?

1348
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:56,675
Sure.

1349
01:08:53,725 --> 01:08:55,454
Cassie...

1350
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:58,215
Jake, don't you know it's
bad luck to see the bride

1351
01:08:58,215 --> 01:09:00,035
before the wedding?

1352
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:02,480
I know.

1353
01:09:07,334 --> 01:09:08,830
Honey...

1354
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:11,556
we can't get married.

1355
01:09:11,676 --> 01:09:14,654
- (Door opening)
- MARTHA: Greetings!

1356
01:09:14,774 --> 01:09:17,577
CASSIE: Martha, Tom, so glad you made it.

1357
01:09:18,295 --> 01:09:21,056
There's something I have to tell you.

1358
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:24,056
We've run into some
roadblocks and I'm afraid...

1359
01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:26,227
Ah, yes. The wedding.

1360
01:09:26,347 --> 01:09:27,756
Wh... what's this?

1361
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:29,808
I got a call from my friend
at the county office about

1362
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:32,276
a mix-up, so Martha and I ran
over and straightened it out.

1363
01:09:32,337 --> 01:09:33,404
Our wedding license!

1364
01:09:33,404 --> 01:09:34,848
They want to know if by any chance

1365
01:09:34,865 --> 01:09:36,386
they gave you a different license?

1366
01:09:37,567 --> 01:09:40,009
Cause there is a very
anxious couple named Kowalski

1367
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,020
in Lakeville who want to get married

1368
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,357
two days after Christmas.

1369
01:09:42,388 --> 01:09:44,562
Well, we can send it with the
minister after our ceremony.

1370
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:45,567
Uh,

1371
01:09:45,966 --> 01:09:47,111
the minister can't make it.

1372
01:09:47,913 --> 01:09:48,549
Why?

1373
01:09:48,612 --> 01:09:49,547
Car trouble.

1374
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:52,351
So, even if we have this license,

1375
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,414
I don't see...

1376
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,022
Well, you don't, but I do.

1377
01:09:55,521 --> 01:09:57,119
I'll get someone to marry you!

1378
01:09:57,201 --> 01:09:58,461
In the next five minutes?

1379
01:09:58,535 --> 01:10:00,422
My dear, I happen to have...

1380
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:01,608
connections.

1381
01:10:02,287 --> 01:10:04,023
- Me?
- Yes, you!

1382
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,743
By the power vested in
you, etcetera, etcetera!

1383
01:10:06,753 --> 01:10:07,615
Why not?

1384
01:10:07,878 --> 01:10:09,057
Well, it's been a while.

1385
01:10:09,737 --> 01:10:10,675
Well, Mayor...

1386
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:12,556
You can take those.

1387
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,379
I know what I want to say.

1388
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:17,830
Martha, thank you.

1389
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,791
Thank you for everything!

1390
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:21,261
Everything?

1391
01:10:21,478 --> 01:10:22,571
Whatever do you mean?

1392
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,740
Well, you got us our license,

1393
01:10:25,074 --> 01:10:26,226
our officiate,

1394
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:27,482
and the venue.

1395
01:10:28,637 --> 01:10:30,643
Do you remember when you told
me that the Heritage Society

1396
01:10:30,657 --> 01:10:32,716
was winding down for the holidays?

1397
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:36,262
You really are a great
wedding planner, Martha!

1398
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:38,043
Well, anyway...

1399
01:10:38,089 --> 01:10:40,259
It's time for you two to
start your new life together.

1400
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,477
Jake, would you escort our guests?

1401
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,021
With pleasure.

1402
01:10:57,424 --> 01:10:59,979
Cassie did a wonderful job.

1403
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:02,526
It's a beautiful room.

1404
01:11:12,721 --> 01:11:16,291
(All whispering)

1405
01:11:34,802 --> 01:11:37,187
Who gives this woman to
be married to this man?

1406
01:11:37,307 --> 01:11:38,965
I do.

1407
01:11:55,265 --> 01:11:57,034
Dear friends and family,

1408
01:11:57,154 --> 01:11:59,556
we are gathered here today
to witness the loving union

1409
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,787
of Jake Russell and Cassandra Nightingale

1410
01:12:01,812 --> 01:12:03,547
in the sacred bond of marriage.

1411
01:12:21,263 --> 01:12:24,614
Jake, please place the
ring on Cassie's finger.

1412
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:37,127
Cassie, with this ring

1413
01:12:37,511 --> 01:12:41,272
I give you all that I am and ever will be.

1414
01:12:41,981 --> 01:12:45,546
With this ring, I thee wed.

1415
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:49,870
Cassie, please put the
ring on Jake's finger.

1416
01:12:55,099 --> 01:12:57,715
As I place this ring on your finger,

1417
01:12:57,835 --> 01:13:00,749
I give you all that I am and ever will be.

1418
01:13:01,535 --> 01:13:05,031
With this ring, I thee wed.

1419
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:12,502
At this time,

1420
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,280
Jake and Cassie would like to
say their own vows to each other.

1421
01:13:17,835 --> 01:13:20,282
Cassie, not long ago you came into my life.

1422
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:23,476
And nothing has been the same since.

1423
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:28,400
Words can't easily express
all that you've given me.

1424
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:31,638
In fact, I can only think of one.

1425
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:34,313
Magic.

1426
01:13:35,938 --> 01:13:37,600
(Chuckling)

1427
01:13:37,602 --> 01:13:39,169
I love you.

1428
01:13:45,438 --> 01:13:47,361
Um, Jake...

1429
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:51,669
You gave me a home when I had none,

1430
01:13:51,789 --> 01:13:54,208
a home in your heart.

1431
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:57,345
And you gave me a family

1432
01:13:57,781 --> 01:14:00,182
when I had none.

1433
01:14:00,926 --> 01:14:03,181
And I will love and cherish them

1434
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:06,258
as I will love and cherish you.

1435
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:10,387
Doesn't take a crystal ball to know

1436
01:14:10,771 --> 01:14:12,789
that you and I will be
each other's strength

1437
01:14:12,832 --> 01:14:14,892
and hope and joy.

1438
01:14:16,678 --> 01:14:18,080
And, um...

1439
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:20,789
this is my promise to you.

1440
01:14:21,106 --> 01:14:24,217
A love that's never going to end.

1441
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:30,611
By the authority vested in
me as Mayor of Middleton,

1442
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:34,363
it gives me great pleasure to
pronounce you husband and wife.

1443
01:14:36,886 --> 01:14:40,100
Jake, you may kiss your bride.

1444
01:14:40,862 --> 01:14:44,587
♪

1445
01:14:44,946 --> 01:14:48,861
(All applauding, cheering)

1446
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:55,541
♪

1447
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:03,614
I've got something to show you.

1448
01:15:08,623 --> 01:15:10,674
Is this... a wedding cake?

1449
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,947
It's a cookie cake.

1450
01:15:11,998 --> 01:15:13,973
I took all the baked goods at hand

1451
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,369
and Lori and I used icing
to hold it all together.

1452
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:19,366
Oh, George, what would we do without you?

1453
01:15:20,297 --> 01:15:21,622
Cassie...

1454
01:15:21,844 --> 01:15:23,879
what if I stayed here?

1455
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:26,699
In Middleton? That would be great, George.

1456
01:15:26,734 --> 01:15:28,383
Not just Middleton.

1457
01:15:28,503 --> 01:15:30,160
In Grey House.

1458
01:15:30,383 --> 01:15:32,058
I could run the place.

1459
01:15:32,314 --> 01:15:34,136
What an interesting idea.

1460
01:15:34,383 --> 01:15:36,136
Well, I got it from you.

1461
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,939
- Did you really?
- When you said

1462
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:39,682
you couldn't be in two places at...

1463
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:41,998
... once.

1464
01:15:42,118 --> 01:15:43,657
(Chuckling)

1465
01:15:44,922 --> 01:15:46,683
You know, it's a big job.

1466
01:15:46,896 --> 01:15:48,854
I could use a big job right now.

1467
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:50,281
On one condition.

1468
01:15:50,401 --> 01:15:51,683
You wouldn't do all the work alone.

1469
01:15:51,726 --> 01:15:53,794
We'd be equal partners.

1470
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:57,650
(Giggling)

1471
01:15:59,051 --> 01:16:00,624
If you'll excuse me,

1472
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:03,589
I need to welcome all my guests.

1473
01:16:06,424 --> 01:16:11,328
♪

1474
01:16:17,883 --> 01:16:20,259
CASSIE: Won't you come in?

1475
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,814
How'd you know I was out here?

1476
01:16:23,934 --> 01:16:27,515
Well, you weren't in there, so I
thought maybe you were out here.

1477
01:16:28,967 --> 01:16:32,608
Well, I, uh... came to get my little girl.

1478
01:16:33,446 --> 01:16:36,831
Family is a very powerful force
this time of year, isn't it?

1479
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:41,113
I don't exactly have a family anymore.

1480
01:16:41,147 --> 01:16:42,592
Oh, Leon.

1481
01:16:42,712 --> 01:16:44,703
Where there's love, there's family.

1482
01:16:45,711 --> 01:16:47,959
You don't have to keep running.

1483
01:16:48,344 --> 01:16:50,712
So, come in from the cold.

1484
01:16:50,746 --> 01:16:52,533
Whenever you're ready.

1485
01:17:11,976 --> 01:17:14,019
- Thank you, Betty.
- You're welcome.

1486
01:17:14,643 --> 01:17:16,732
Isn't she a lovely bride?

1487
01:17:16,852 --> 01:17:19,156
Hope I'm not late for dinner...

1488
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:21,882
Gwen?

1489
01:17:22,002 --> 01:17:23,352
Hello, George.

1490
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,993
I thought only Cassie popped up like this.

1491
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,399
I brought my daughter and
grandchildren with me for a visit.

1492
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,252
They've never seen snow, but...

1493
01:17:31,491 --> 01:17:34,117
now the weather station
says no snow this Christmas!

1494
01:17:34,138 --> 01:17:35,437
Well, they're wrong.

1495
01:17:35,471 --> 01:17:38,066
Cassie's forecast is for snow. Tonight.

1496
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:41,012
- Well, I hope she's right.
- You can bet on it.

1497
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:44,020
Is snow the only reason you came back?

1498
01:17:44,747 --> 01:17:47,354
You're the only reason I needed, George.

1499
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:49,722
I guess you haven't heard, but...

1500
01:17:49,927 --> 01:17:51,320
after the honeymoon,

1501
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,765
I'm moving into Grey House.

1502
01:17:53,885 --> 01:17:55,363
Really, George?

1503
01:17:55,406 --> 01:17:56,448
It's a big house.

1504
01:17:56,474 --> 01:17:58,363
- I know.
- Lot's of room...

1505
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:00,439
Yes, yes, there is.

1506
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:03,542
It can use some of my Irish hospitality.

1507
01:18:03,662 --> 01:18:05,277
No doubt.

1508
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:13,575
There we go.

1509
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:17,763
Excuse me?

1510
01:18:24,063 --> 01:18:25,516
I wanted to give you this.

1511
01:18:27,046 --> 01:18:28,738
It's all there.

1512
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,321
The money from the Shelbyville Bank job.

1513
01:18:33,789 --> 01:18:36,054
It was hidden under the floor of your shop.

1514
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,473
Cassie's shop?

1515
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:41,841
Yeah, well, it wasn't a
shop when I stashed it there.

1516
01:18:42,072 --> 01:18:44,235
It was just an abandoned building.

1517
01:18:45,191 --> 01:18:46,644
Okay.

1518
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:49,585
This isn't exactly the right time or place.

1519
01:18:49,636 --> 01:18:51,063
No, it is the time.

1520
01:18:51,959 --> 01:18:54,269
Cause I want my little
girl to see me do it.

1521
01:19:00,246 --> 01:19:02,887
I had a plan to win Jodi back.

1522
01:19:03,734 --> 01:19:05,255
I figured I could convince her

1523
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:06,838
to run away and live with her dad.

1524
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:10,136
But then I realized...

1525
01:19:10,427 --> 01:19:12,392
that you can't buy love.

1526
01:19:15,837 --> 01:19:17,914
And I don't want to run anymore.

1527
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,709
So how do we know this
isn't just another con?

1528
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,350
It's not a crime to return the money.

1529
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,777
And Leon has done his time.

1530
01:19:31,111 --> 01:19:34,410
Look, I know I've made
some big mistakes, alright?

1531
01:19:34,974 --> 01:19:36,658
And I know it's going to
take time for everybody

1532
01:19:36,701 --> 01:19:38,179
to trust me again.

1533
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:42,050
But I'm going to stay right
here and do whatever it takes.

1534
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:45,913
Cause I want that second chance.

1535
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:48,247
I want a family again.

1536
01:19:52,665 --> 01:19:56,127
Jodi, I've never had
anything but love for you.

1537
01:19:56,973 --> 01:19:59,503
And I know how much I hurt you.

1538
01:20:00,132 --> 01:20:01,947
I saw the hurt in your eyes the other night

1539
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:04,708
when you dropped the
silver dollar off for Santa.

1540
01:20:06,315 --> 01:20:09,238
You were watching that family
on the street, weren't you?

1541
01:20:10,109 --> 01:20:12,588
That happy family.

1542
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:16,844
And that's all you
really want for Christmas.

1543
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,425
Not this... money.

1544
01:20:22,676 --> 01:20:24,510
You said it yourself, angel.

1545
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:26,621
I was a god guy once.

1546
01:20:28,348 --> 01:20:30,775
So can you let me be that guy again?

1547
01:20:44,843 --> 01:20:46,638
A second chance.

1548
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:52,373
I guess a second chance is worth a try.

1549
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:58,117
DEREK: Jake!

1550
01:20:58,237 --> 01:21:01,339
I put a lock on his car, he
can't go anywhere. He's...

1551
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:06,228
He's... right here.

1552
01:21:06,245 --> 01:21:07,570
Yep.

1553
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:13,954
Uh, Chief?

1554
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,972
Does this mean that I'm off duty now?

1555
01:21:16,186 --> 01:21:18,442
Well, Derek, you put this in the lock-up.

1556
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:21,605
Then do whatever you want.

1557
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:25,297
So...

1558
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:28,742
what do you say we get an early
start on that Christmas date?

1559
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,486
I'll save you a seat at dinner tonight.

1560
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:39,623
Would this be a good time
to say "Merry Christmas"?

1561
01:21:39,743 --> 01:21:41,580
It's going to be a very merry Christmas,

1562
01:21:41,618 --> 01:21:42,984
cause tomorrow morning...

1563
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:45,239
I'm going to wake up with my family.

1564
01:21:46,828 --> 01:21:49,316
Do you know the moment that
I fell in love with you?

1565
01:21:50,684 --> 01:21:54,328
It was when I first saw
you come down your stairs.

1566
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:59,137
Well, it took me a little
longer to fall in love with you.

1567
01:21:59,718 --> 01:22:03,308
It was when I reached
the bottom of my stairs.

1568
01:22:05,138 --> 01:22:07,650
Of course, I didn't know what I was in for.

1569
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:09,257
Well...

1570
01:22:09,574 --> 01:22:11,052
you still don't.

1571
01:22:11,172 --> 01:22:13,719
(Chuckling)

1572
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:21,323
Cassie!

1573
01:22:27,314 --> 01:22:29,682
You are a bundle of Christmas surprises.

1574
01:22:29,802 --> 01:22:32,298
Well, there's a lot more
where that came from.

1575
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:34,905
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1576
01:22:40,648 --> 01:22:43,750
Look, it's snowing, just
like Cassie said it would.

1577
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,537
How did...

1578
01:22:48,913 --> 01:22:50,776
Magic happens.
