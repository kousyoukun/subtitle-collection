1
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:17,418
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:21,175
Derek? I'm just doing a
little window shopping.

3
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,599
I'll be back in around 20.

4
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,040
No rush, Chief. There's not much going on.

5
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,134
What about a blue cashmere scarf, Derek?

6
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:35,694
Oh, thanks, Chief!

7
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
But won't it clash with my uniform?

8
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:39,263
For Cassie.

9
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:42,531
Otherwise I pretty much have
my Christmas shopping done.

10
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:50,007
What about jewellery, Derek?

11
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:52,592
I mean, Cassie's tastes
aren't exactly traditional.

12
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:53,846
Ah, you're right.

13
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:56,459
What do you get a woman
who can conjure up anything?

14
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,037
Hmm.

15
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:06,113
Derek, I think I see someone.

16
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:08,383
I'll catch you later.

17
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,195
10-4.

18
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,771
Chief Russell!

19
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,435
Hello, sweetheart.

20
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:22,881
Hi.

21
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:25,385
Hi, you looking for someone?

22
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,838
I thought I saw someone who I...

23
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,741
knew, but...

24
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:33,639
Well, this is the season
to reach out to old friends.

25
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:35,013
Aren't you cold?

26
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,384
Oh, no, I just came out
to check my window display.

27
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:40,378
Doesn't that make you want to step inside?

28
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:46,121
- When did you get the automatic doors?
- I didn't.

29
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,131
Hey.

30
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,027
Can you do that in uniform?

31
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,868
I'm the chief, I can do whatever I want.

32
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,597
In that case, do it again.

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,890
I've decided. The wedding
should be in April.

34
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:13,421
Hmm... April can be very unpredictable.

35
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,160
- So can you.
- Hmm, I suppose.

36
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:17,291
But when it comes to Christmas,

37
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,981
I can be very traditional.

38
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:21,191
Oh, I love the season.

39
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,161
Can't say the same for
everybody in my house.

40
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,458
Oh?

41
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,516
You know, Christmas
really hasn't been the same

42
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:28,845
since Jenny passed away.

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,444
Yeah, they miss their mom.

44
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:35,664
I got my Christmas shopping done.

45
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:38,601
Except for you.

46
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:40,752
I have the only gift I need.

47
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:45,064
You're my bride to be, this
has to be the perfect gift.

48
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,527
What's this?

49
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:49,376
An astrological calendar.

50
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:51,363
For this year.

51
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,841
There's two weeks left.

52
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,625
People have a lot to do in these two weeks.

53
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:56,495
Tell me about it.

54
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,176
Why don't you keep it?

55
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:02,111
Jake, it's not your only gift,

56
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,117
just think of it as a stocking stuffer.

57
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,722
Thank you.

58
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:16,894
So? Any luck?

59
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,233
Oh, no, but I should have
a positive ID any minute now

60
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:21,658
if it's who I think it is.

61
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,823
No, I meant did you find
something for Cassie?

62
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:27,540
Oh, no, not yet.

63
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:30,380
It's gotta be the best Christmas gift ever.

64
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,721
Well, yeah, she is your fiancée.

65
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,207
It's not that, Derek, it's...

66
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:37,587
Cassie spent a lot of sad Christmas
mornings at that foster home.

67
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:40,426
Maybe when you two
finally pick a wedding date

68
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,075
next year will be a little different.

69
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:45,220
We've been trying to pick
a wedding date for months.

70
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:46,971
Give me this.

71
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:50,127
Jake, how are you going to
find a wedding date next year?

72
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,067
This is this year's calendar.

73
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:56,915
Leon Deeks.

74
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:58,951
What?

75
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,844
Leon Deeks.

76
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:03,126
In a message from State Prison,

77
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:06,237
"Leon Deeks was released from
federal prison two days ago".

78
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,111
I knew that's who I saw.

79
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:11,338
Served 10 years out of a 15 year sentence.

80
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,976
How do you know this guy?

81
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:15,723
Do you remember the Shelbyville
National Bank robbery?

82
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:18,400
- I remember hearing about it.
- He was the robber.

83
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,059
What do you think he's doing here?

84
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,431
I think he's either here to
visit his ex-wife and daughter

85
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:24,080
who still live in Middleton,

86
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:25,770
or...

87
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,724
Or what?

88
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,113
After the robbery, I was
the one who arrested him

89
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,813
and sent him to prison.

90
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:33,994
Whoa.

91
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,141
"Whoa" is right.

92
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:37,953
Let's take a drive through town.

93
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:39,755
See if he's still window shopping.

94
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:41,465
How much did Deeks walk away with?

95
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:42,941
$100,000.

96
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,437
Still missing.

97
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,183
Are you alright?

98
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:13,793
That wind, it just loves
to open and close my door.

99
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,282
- Who are you?
- I'm Cassie Nightingale.

100
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:19,295
The proprietor. Welcome.

101
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,998
So, uh, you did all this?

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,429
Excuse me?

103
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:34,062
All this work. It's so broken down.

104
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,892
Oh, yeah, I suppose it was pretty run down.

105
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:39,915
I was just glad I was able
to give it a second chance.

106
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:42,542
I love second chances, don't you?

107
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:46,327
I don't know. I'm still
waiting for my first.

108
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,121
- Are you from around here?
- I used to be.

109
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:53,042
Then maybe you know my
fiancé, Jake Russell?

110
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,489
Yeah, Chief Russell. Yeah, we go way back.

111
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,662
Are you hunting for anything in particular?

112
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:03,909
- Huh?
- In the shop?

113
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,759
Uh, what's that back there? Feathers?

114
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,075
Peacock feathers. Just got them in.

115
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,599
I'll just be a minute,
they're still in the box.

116
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:19,528
Feel free to look around!

117
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,823
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, over there!

118
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,699
Here we go...

119
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:42,864
Merry Christmas.

120
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,285
Well, look who's finally
decided to emerge from his room!

121
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:10,701
Hey, Grandpa.

122
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:14,080
Tinsel or no tinsel this year?

123
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,116
You decide.

124
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:19,057
You... you're going to help
me decorate, aren't you?

125
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:22,131
Uh, no, I'm headed out
to a movie with my...

126
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:24,065
friend.

127
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,652
We'll be grabbing pizza later.

128
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:28,716
- I guess your dad knows?
- Of course.

129
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,016
I'm outta here. Back before 10:00.

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,652
- See ya.
- Well, Lori,

131
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:37,677
looks like it's you and me tonight.

132
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,621
Dad's going out with Cassie, so...

133
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,980
How about you and I stir up
a batch of Christmas cookies?

134
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:44,801
Christmas cookies?

135
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:46,084
You know the little round ones you like

136
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:46,990
with the powdered sugar?

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,493
Sorry, I'm going to a sleepover with Amy.

138
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:53,005
- Didn't Dad tell you?
- Oh... no.

139
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,700
No, he didn't.

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,929
Oh, there's my ride.

141
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,372
Later!

142
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:10,896
Resolved that Betty will
repaint her business sign

143
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,586
out by the highway.

144
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:13,837
What?

145
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:15,456
Passed!

146
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,713
But I need that sign for
my bakery to do business!

147
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,820
Uh-uh, ASAP, Betty.

148
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,058
We want the holiday shoppers visiting town

149
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,003
to feel good about Middleton.

150
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,985
It's all about the
gracious, traditional image

151
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,410
that we want to project.

152
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,608
But your slogan?

153
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:34,805
"Turn left for the best
sticky buns in the state!"

154
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,247
- Ugh!
- Well, they are...

155
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,884
It's just so tacky.

156
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:42,712
After all, Middleton is not a truck stop!

157
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,583
So, if there is no further business,

158
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:48,655
everyone have a very merry Christmas,

159
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,420
the happiest of holidays,

160
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:53,228
etcetera, etcetera, and so forth.

161
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:55,356
This session of the
Middleton Citizen's League

162
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,299
is hereby adjourned!

163
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,807
Whoo!

164
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,363
Have you thought about my proposal?

165
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,500
About Cassie Nightingale?

166
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,427
Inviting her to join the Citizen's League?

167
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,714
Oh, my dear Gwen.

168
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:17,543
I thought you were joking!

169
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:18,976
Oh, Martha?

170
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:20,618
Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.

171
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,703
- Gwen.
- Hello, dear.

172
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:26,520
I love my new gavel! A
little present to myself.

173
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,241
Martha, walk with me a minute.

174
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,012
Oh, well, you'll have to walk quickly.

175
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,833
I'm late for my mani-pedi.

176
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:34,338
Martha, this isn't easy for me to say.

177
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:37,564
I just finished talking
with our business manager.

178
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,164
- It's about our real estate investments.
- What about them?

179
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:41,711
They failed.

180
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,853
What do you mean?

181
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:47,248
We've lost everything.

182
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,427
- Not the Orlando condo?
- Everything.

183
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,638
Martha, we're broke. All our money is gone.

184
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:58,051
How can that be?

185
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:01,939
We're not destitute. I still
have my mayor's salary, our house.

186
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,463
But there will have to be some changes.

187
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,837
Oh, Tom...

188
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,188
You know how I hate changes!

189
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,468
Well, for a start...

190
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:13,365
you have to get a job.

191
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:15,309
A jo...

192
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:19,997
- What about the Citizen's League?
- A paying job.

193
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:21,813
Until we get back on our feet.

194
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,088
I don't understand! How
could this have happened?

195
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:28,075
What's happened to a lot of people.

196
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:32,456
We'll pull through.

197
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,752
And we'll talk more tonight, okay?

198
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,225
Oh, and Martha?

199
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,658
Until further notice,

200
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:44,978
please do your own nails.

201
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:56,627
I wonder if we're going to get
a white Christmas this year.

202
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:59,937
- I hope not.
- How come?

203
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,456
I mean, why waste a perfectly good snow day

204
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,883
when we're going to be off school anyway?

205
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:08,300
Think the stores will
be open after the movie?

206
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:09,812
Maybe.

207
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,822
I want to get my mom
something different this year.

208
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,385
Any ideas?

209
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:16,607
A snow shovel?

210
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:31,220
Hello, Jake.

211
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,075
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

212
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:36,056
What a nice surprise.

213
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,532
Well, speaking of surprises,

214
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,590
- I've got one for you.
- Hmm!

215
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:43,904
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

216
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,088
I got your Christmas gift.

217
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:51,106
Jake, I already told you, you
don't have to give me anything.

218
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:52,767
No, you gave me this calendar,

219
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,109
and I've been looking at it,

220
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:56,115
and I decided one gift deserves another.

221
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,616
So this is the most exciting
gift that I can imagine.

222
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,507
Well, I could do with a little excitement.

223
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,749
My bed and breakfast gets
very quiet over the holidays.

224
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:05,531
Cassie...

225
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,319
I want to give you a family for Christmas.

226
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:10,596
What do you mean?

227
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,321
I mean let's get married.

228
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:15,213
I think I already said yes.

229
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,740
No, I mean now.

230
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,011
Jake Russell, when did
you get so spontaneous?

231
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,117
The day that I decided
you were the one for me.

232
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,472
Oh, maybe my personality
is rubbing off on you.

233
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:26,666
Come on, we've been trying
to set a date for this wedding

234
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,740
for months and something
always gets in the way.

235
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,398
What was the excuse last time?

236
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,149
Mercury in retrograde.

237
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:34,936
Okay, well, the calendar
that you gave me says...

238
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:37,292
"This is the perfect time
to forge new partnerships

239
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,601
and initiate long-term plans".

240
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,883
Does it really say all that? Hmm...

241
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:46,609
Jake, Christmas is only seven days away.

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,543
Not on Christmas.

243
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:52,811
On Christmas Eve.

244
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,902
Pull a wedding together in six days?

245
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,580
We'll get everybody to chip in.

246
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,561
Oh, so little time, so much fun.

247
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:03,041
Cassie, I want you to
wake up Christmas morning

248
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:05,083
with the family you've always wanted.

249
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:07,887
We're going to put the
magic back in Christmas

250
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,841
for you and the kids and George,

251
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,098
and on Christmas morning we'll
wake up one, big, happy family.

252
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,850
We have some news.

253
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:20,471
We finally set a date for the wedding!

254
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,805
When is it going to be?

255
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,066
Christmas Eve.

256
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,151
- That's great!
- That's um...

257
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,860
Yeah, six days, I know.

258
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:28,397
Is it going to be at Grey House?

259
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,726
I would think Grey House is
going to be a little too cozy

260
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:31,971
for our guests.

261
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,122
We wouldn't want to leave anyone out.

262
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:37,373
Uh... can you get it together that fast?

263
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:38,703
We're going to need everyone's help.

264
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,006
Starting right now.

265
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,658
Who wants to help me do some baking?

266
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,086
I do!

267
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,761
How 'bout you, George?

268
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:52,102
Uh, I'm feeling a little tired.

269
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,831
I think I'll take a nap.

270
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,694
It's going to be a perfect wedding.

271
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:01,184
- Yeah.
- A magical wedding.

272
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:03,852
Come on!

273
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:07,087
I'm afraid we might need more than magic.

274
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,932
I think we may need a miracle.

275
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:12,908
Hmm, well, fortunately this
is the season of miracles.

276
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,995
Thank you. No, I tried to object, Gwen.

277
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:29,283
Martha can't tell me what
to paint on my own sign.

278
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:32,807
Well, I'm just about...

279
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,677
I'm going to call you back later.

280
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,058
Hello, Martha.

281
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:47,653
- Coffee?
- Actually, that's not why I'm here.

282
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:51,712
Martha, I told you... I just
can't afford to re-paint my sign.

283
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,100
Whatever you think best.

284
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:55,920
Um... okay. Then...

285
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:57,633
what can I do for you?

286
00:15:58,779 --> 00:15:59,529
Betty...

287
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:01,574
I've decided to take a more...

288
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:04,576
hands-on approach to
helping our community.

289
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:07,000
How do you mean?

290
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,267
Well, I thought I could start right here.

291
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,749
Perhaps as a hostess,

292
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:13,729
welcoming people as they enter.

293
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:17,058
Are you asking me for a job?

294
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:19,631
In a manner of speaking.

295
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:21,730
I simply thought that with the holidays,

296
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:23,286
you might use a little assistance.

297
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:26,361
You know, I might have an opening.

298
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,891
Why don't you just let me
talk to Marty in the kitchen.

299
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,392
In the kitchen? Oh, no, no, no!

300
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:35,949
I thought something perhaps that
would showcase my people skills!

301
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:38,021
Such as a hostess!

302
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,661
Leon Deeks was about to
rob that cash register

303
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:36,635
until my wife threw her hip into it.

304
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,457
Martha... stopped a robbery with her hips?

305
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,176
I hope you're not joking, Deputy,

306
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,729
because this is no laughing matter.

307
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,855
I'm aware that Leon Deeks

308
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,752
is back in Middleton, Mayor Tinsdale.

309
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:47,971
What are you doing about it?

310
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,993
Well, first of all, we're
going to have to talk with

311
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,665
all the business owners in Middleton.

312
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:54,170
We do not want a repeat of
that Shelbyville Bank job

313
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:54,985
10 years ago.

314
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:56,419
No, sir, we do not.

315
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:57,904
That's why I'm keeping my eye on him.

316
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,343
24/7, Jake.

317
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,001
This town is flush with holiday cash.

318
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:04,080
For the next week,

319
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,931
Leon Deeks is your one and only priority.

320
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,276
A DJ for the reception?

321
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:19,595
What sort of music?

322
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:20,861
All sorts!

323
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:21,664
Yeah, that's right,

324
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,848
and any Christmas carols you can dance to.

325
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,338
Thank you!

326
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:32,161
Ah, dried sage, sprinkled sea salt...

327
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,162
spirit stones...

328
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:35,643
Hello, Derek.

329
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,795
You working on a potion?

330
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,771
No, making a list for the ceremony.

331
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:43,204
Well, just here on orders from the chief.

332
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,908
Going up and down the block.

333
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,639
Making sure that all
the shop keepers are...

334
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,811
being extra careful.

335
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,853
Hmm, is there cause for alarm?

336
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,479
No, just better to be safe than sorry.

337
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,460
Plus, it gets me out of the office.

338
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,258
And you can do your Christmas shopping.

339
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:57,357
Yeah.

340
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,281
Is there someone special
you're buying for this year?

341
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,907
A young lady, perhaps?

342
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,497
I wish.

343
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,092
You do? Hmm...

344
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,509
How can I help you with that?

345
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:07,827
Got a sister?

346
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,092
No, I'm afraid I don't.

347
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:12,933
Well, maybe I'll write a letter to Santa.

348
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,325
Now, that's the spirit.

349
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:18,140
Oh, and Derek, don't forget my pie plates.

350
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,422
I need them back.

351
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,610
So I can cook you up something new.

352
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:23,731
Right.

353
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:55,529
There you are!

354
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,290
Come help me decorate the tree.

355
00:19:57,473 --> 00:20:00,137
Mom, why did you waste
your money on that thing?

356
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,236
Because it's Christmas.

357
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:07,047
Why don't you put the star on top?

358
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:08,965
Remember that?

359
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,297
How could I forget?

360
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:13,727
You made that when you were five years old.

361
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:16,348
With a lot of love.

362
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:19,007
Life was pretty nice back then.

363
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:21,263
A long time ago.

364
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:23,134
Sweetie...

365
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,201
Merry Christmas, Ruth.

366
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:34,697
Leon...

367
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:42,325
Dad?

368
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,968
How you doing, angel?

369
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:49,015
You're so big.

370
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:50,652
Last time I saw you...

371
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:52,585
You were sentenced to 15 years?

372
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:54,670
Why are you here?

373
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:56,192
Well, I'm out.

374
00:20:57,552 --> 00:20:59,851
Got five years off for good behaviour.

375
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:02,633
Why are you here?

376
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,811
Why not? We're family, right?

377
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,239
We were.

378
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,247
Look, Ruth, that was a low
blow sending me divorce papers

379
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:13,222
while I was stuck in the pen.

380
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:15,792
But I forgive you.

381
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,903
You forgive me?

382
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:19,789
Yeah.

383
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:21,571
And to prove it,

384
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:23,823
I'm going to make this the biggest,

385
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,998
best Christmas our little girl ever had.

386
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:30,556
Jodi, if you could have
anything, anything at all...

387
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:31,592
what would it be?

388
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,453
I... I don't know.

389
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:36,235
Keep thinking about it
cause I'm getting it for you.

390
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:38,070
No.

391
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,874
You are out of my life,

392
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:42,734
and I am going to make
sure you stay out of Jodi's

393
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,130
- if I have to take you to court to do it.
- Mom!

394
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:47,385
- Hey, she's my daughter, too, alright?
- No.

395
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:49,586
Get out.

396
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,668
At least let the kid decide for herself.

397
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:55,638
Get out and don't you ever come back.

398
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:13,436
Oh, which of these
invitations do you prefer?

399
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:15,253
Uh, which one do you like?

400
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,341
- That one.
- Me, too.

401
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,396
Good.

402
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,351
And I have to run to the florist.

403
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:20,504
There's been a run on poinsettias,

404
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,041
but I think I can swing it.

405
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:23,771
We have a bigger problem than that.

406
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,012
I know, the golf course
and the VFW turned us down.

407
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:29,300
Cause they were both
nine months in advance.

408
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:31,296
But I think it'll all work out in the end.

409
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,075
Cassie, it's not about the venue.

410
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:34,373
It's about the marriage license.

411
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:36,578
They have new I.D. requirements,

412
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:38,992
and some of your records don't exist.

413
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:42,101
Yes, I suppose I have had a chequered past.

414
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:44,674
Well, I'm looking for the
court documents, but...

415
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,880
six days till Christmas and with
people gone for the holidays...

416
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,284
What are you saying?

417
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:51,572
I'm saying that unless we can prove

418
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:53,511
that you're Cassandra Nightingale...

419
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:57,043
We might have to postpone the wedding.

420
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:07,461
Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas.
Thank you very much.

421
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:10,840
Have you got all your
Christmas shopping done?

422
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,430
- Hello, Merry Christmas!
- Hi!

423
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:38,950
Hello, Betty.

424
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:40,787
Can I help you?

425
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:42,875
Um, I'm just looking.

426
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:44,768
Let me know if you need anything.

427
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:45,746
Okay.

428
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:49,382
What are you doing?

429
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:51,932
People come into the store
so stressed this time of year,

430
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:54,393
a little incense helps lighten the energy.

431
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:55,248
Hmm.

432
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,994
You know what? It smells really familiar.

433
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,923
Almost smells like...

434
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:01,763
Like what?

435
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,791
Like my apple ginger pie.

436
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:06,819
Mmm.

437
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,190
How is that even possible?

438
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,951
Oh, you'd be surprised at what's possible.

439
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:13,400
Hmm.

440
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,578
You know, I'm a big
fan of that pie of yours

441
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,611
and about a dozen other
things on your menu.

442
00:24:17,731 --> 00:24:19,888
I was wondering if...

443
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,619
if you could cater my wedding.

444
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:23,874
When is your big day?

445
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,089
Uh, Christmas Eve?

446
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:29,200
That's a tall order.

447
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:31,102
But I'd love to.

448
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:33,347
Oh, I know how busy you
are this time of year.

449
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,573
Yeah, this season it's
always rush, rush, rush.

450
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:37,578
Right up until Christmas
finally arrives and

451
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:40,694
I can go home and relax
in my easy chair all day.

452
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,637
Alone.

453
00:24:49,469 --> 00:24:50,631
Oh, wow!

454
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,132
God that sparkles!

455
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,668
Oh yeah, I placed that there
to take advantage of the light.

456
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,266
Try it on.

457
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:02,939
Me? Oh, no, I...

458
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:05,331
I'm not really the type to wear jewellery.

459
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,582
Are you sure?

460
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,694
You know, I should probably
get back to the bake shop.

461
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,737
Okay.

462
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:16,587
Merry Christmas, Martha.

463
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:17,921
What? Oh,

464
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:19,823
yes, I suppose it is.

465
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:22,538
Oh, and be sure to send me your
wedding menu as soon as you can.

466
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:23,789
I will.

467
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:26,473
Hello, Martha.

468
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:28,176
Miss Nightingale...

469
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:29,245
I have been

470
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:31,830
in and out of every shop on this street.

471
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,482
Oh, and not one bag to show for it!

472
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:35,264
Oh, I haven't been buying, I've been...

473
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:39,135
I've been so busy.

474
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:41,695
With the Citizen's League and the

475
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,113
Christmas Decorating Committee and

476
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:45,395
of course the Heritage Society, although,

477
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:47,880
thank goodness that's winding
down now for the holidays.

478
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,376
Well, you know, I've been busy, too.

479
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:50,658
I guess you heard the good news.

480
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:52,606
- The wedding. Congratulations!
- Yeah.

481
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:53,956
Thank you. I hope you can make it,

482
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:55,107
I know it's very last minute.

483
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,780
And Christmas Eve.

484
00:25:57,041 --> 00:26:00,173
The Mayor and I have several
long standing social obligations.

485
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:01,210
You understand.

486
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:04,097
Well, it would mean a lot
to me if you could be there.

487
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:10,351
You really know how to make
a party come alive, Martha.

488
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:11,346
I do?

489
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:15,911
Yes, I suppose I do.

490
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:19,194
Huh.

491
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,510
Make a party.

492
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,866
So can I count you in, then?

493
00:26:50,746 --> 00:26:51,955
Leon!

494
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:56,203
Jake Russell.

495
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:58,034
What, no backup?

496
00:26:58,036 --> 00:26:59,506
Tough guy.

497
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:01,174
Can I talk to you?

498
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:02,554
Yeah, go ahead talk.

499
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,274
What are you doing in Middleton?

500
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:06,421
I'm visiting my family.

501
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,168
You remember? The ones who have been

502
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:10,481
without a husband and a
father for the past 10 years?

503
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:12,782
- Thanks to you.
- I didn't rob a bank.

504
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:15,865
Still haven't found the money.

505
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:17,762
I told them where I hid that money.

506
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:19,007
It's in a warehouse in Shelbyville.

507
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,742
- Wasn't there.
- No?

508
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:23,743
It's not really the money that's
bothering you, is it, Chief?

509
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:26,601
What's bothering you is
the family you destroyed.

510
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,075
My family.

511
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,524
You did that on your own, Leon.

512
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:32,973
I was doing my duty.

513
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:36,361
Don't give me a reason to
send you back there again.

514
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,067
Yeah, don't worry about me, Jake.

515
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,745
Worry about yourself.

516
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:50,077
Oh, thank you!

517
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,751
Mom's been kind of wired lately.

518
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,555
Maybe something to help
her, you know... chill.

519
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:03,037
Spa in a box.

520
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:06,131
Lavender bath oils, relaxing facial,

521
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,476
and magnetic stones to
place on her pressure points.

522
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:12,284
I've got it!

523
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:13,915
I've got it!

524
00:28:14,351 --> 00:28:16,416
Got what, Martha? The Christmas spirit?

525
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:18,363
No, no, no, no! My new career.

526
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:21,460
I'm going to be a personal
wedding planner, and

527
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,979
you are my very first client.

528
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:26,468
Well, that is very
thoughtful of you, Martha.

529
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:33,327
I'll handle it all. Music,
menu, colour scheme...

530
00:28:33,366 --> 00:28:34,122
theme!

531
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:38,154
From your, wait for it,
12 drummers drumming,

532
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,519
to your partridge in a pear tree.

533
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,493
That sounds like you
have some very big plans.

534
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:43,665
They have to be big!

535
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,711
I expect potential clients to take notice

536
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,293
and hire me for future events!

537
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,879
Now, for the seven swans a-swimming,

538
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:52,387
I was thinking... ice sculptures!

539
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,881
You know, I don't want
to dampen your enthusiasm,

540
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,519
- but how much is this going to cost?
- Not a penny.

541
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:01,701
I intend on working gratis.

542
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:04,743
It's only fair. It is my vision, after all.

543
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:06,762
Well, I have a vision, too.

544
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,345
So maybe we could have
a meeting of the minds.

545
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:10,727
Well, then, you need to make
some decisions immediately!

546
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:12,213
Luckily, I brought swatches.

547
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:14,962
By the way,

548
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,238
I would keep my eye on her if I were you.

549
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:20,583
I believe she's Leon Deeks' daughter.

550
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:21,884
If you know what I mean.

551
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,772
Hey, guys!

552
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:27,544
Hi, Lori!

553
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:29,029
Cassie...

554
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:35,091
Dad wants you to sign these so
he can get the marriage license.

555
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:38,708
Something about permission to
search for your birth records?

556
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,412
Getting married sure is complicated.

557
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,680
It takes so many people to
make it all come together.

558
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:54,651
Lori,

559
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:56,741
would you look after this?

560
00:29:57,898 --> 00:29:59,264
This is the ring

561
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:01,609
your father's going to
give me in the ceremony.

562
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:05,090
It belonged to my mother.

563
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:06,408
It's beautiful.

564
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:08,941
Yeah, it's one of the few
things I have of my mother's.

565
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:13,485
So I need you to take very good
care of it until the wedding.

566
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,201
You can count on me.

567
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,436
Oh, in that case, would you
watch the store for one minute?

568
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,488
I've got to run down and
pick up my wedding dress.

569
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:22,022
Dress? Oh, it has to be white!

570
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:23,888
It can't be off-white!

571
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,624
We can't have you clashing
with the ice sculptures!

572
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:28,271
Okay!

573
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:34,232
She acts like she's
the one getting married.

574
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:38,865
Okay. I think my mom's
really going to like this.

575
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,685
Speaking of gifts,

576
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:42,481
what are we going to
get Cassie for Christmas?

577
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:46,317
I don't know. She's so amazing,
the gift has to be amazing, too.

578
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:47,641
Yeah.

579
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,726
Hey, Jodi, any ideas for my new...

580
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:52,727
step-mom?

581
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,180
Where'd she go?

582
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:56,469
She must have stepped out.

583
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:03,108
Brandon, where's the ring?!

584
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:05,880
Beats me.

585
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:08,261
I left it right here on the counter!

586
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,508
It's gotta be here someplace, okay?

587
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:13,796
Where? It couldn't just disappear!

588
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:15,480
Lori...

589
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:17,184
We've got to find it.

590
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:18,398
What are we going to tell Cassie?

591
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,113
We're not going to tell Cassie!

592
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:22,917
She's got enough on her
mind. Just... keep looking!

593
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:58,151
Oh! Hi, Brandon!

594
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,088
Hi, Jodi.

595
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:00,214
Lori,

596
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,706
what are you doing here?

597
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,648
I was just, uh...

598
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:07,616
going for a walk. You guys been shopping?

599
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:10,276
Yeah, I got my mom that spa in the box.

600
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,606
I was all set to buy it when
I saw her outside the shop.

601
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,843
So I cleared out fast.

602
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:16,510
Better go hide this under my bed.

603
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,692
Bye, Brandon.

604
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,288
I know why you're here.

605
00:32:26,017 --> 00:32:28,166
You came over to accuse
Jodi of taking the ring.

606
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:29,791
No!

607
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:31,722
Thought maybe she stole it, right?

608
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:33,254
Because of who her dad is?

609
00:32:33,462 --> 00:32:35,802
Lori, I want to find it, too...
- Brandon, I...

610
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:38,086
You're as bad as Martha Tinsdale!

611
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,283
What's wrong, honey?

612
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:48,925
What do you mean?

613
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:51,062
Well, for one thing, you
haven't complained once

614
00:32:51,084 --> 00:32:53,381
about doing all this
Christmas shopping with me.

615
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:56,039
- I got a lot of things on my mind.
- The wedding.

616
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,583
That and what happens after.

617
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:00,374
I'm moving out.

618
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:05,933
To make room for the newlyweds.
George, you're such a romantic.

619
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,875
That's why I fell for you.

620
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,808
This is your chance to start a new life.

621
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:13,734
Ask yourself, "What does
George O'Hanrahan want?"

622
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,738
More than anything?

623
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,099
To put these packages down.
My arms are killing me.

624
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,204
Well, why don't you lug them to my place?

625
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:25,885
- And I'll put on a pot of coffee?
- You're on.

626
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,844
Let's get this stuff under the tree.

627
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,229
I don't have a tree.

628
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:31,512
You know I'm leaving
for San Diego tomorrow.

629
00:33:31,694 --> 00:33:33,104
You had to remind me.

630
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:36,550
- You don't want me to go?
- That's not what I meant.

631
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:38,610
I know how important
this trip is to you, Gwen.

632
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,427
Well, you're important to me,
too, George. You know that.

633
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:43,670
It's just...

634
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:46,713
It wouldn't be Christmas
without my grandchildren.

635
00:33:46,918 --> 00:33:48,114
You understand.

636
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:50,268
I do, I really do.

637
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:53,461
I love Christmas with my grandkids.

638
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,957
Then what are you saying?

639
00:33:57,331 --> 00:33:59,136
I'm going to miss you, Gwen.

640
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:01,502
Oh, I'm going to miss you, too.

641
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,703
But I'll be back before you can blink.

642
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,556
Just in time for a happy new year.

643
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,859
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, thank you very much.

644
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:22,773
Dad?

645
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:23,949
Lori!

646
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,887
- Honey, have you got a problem?
- Yeah.

647
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,815
Brandon.

648
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:32,435
Brandon?

649
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:34,151
- What's wrong?
- Well,

650
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:36,239
I lost Cassie's wedding ring.

651
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:39,779
- You... you did?
- And I think

652
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:41,864
Brandon's friend Jodi knows where it is.

653
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:42,720
Why would she know?

654
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,901
Because she was right next
to it when it disappeared!

655
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:46,598
And I never said she stole it!

656
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:48,119
I just wanted to talk to her about it.

657
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:49,930
But now Brandon acts like
I hate her or something!

658
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:51,281
And I don't hate her, but...

659
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,503
What if she does have the
ring? I need to get it back!

660
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:56,242
Alright, what did Cassie say?

661
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,036
Well, you can't tell Cassie!

662
00:34:58,457 --> 00:35:00,175
Alright. Well, I'll, uh...

663
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:01,247
I'll talk to Brandon.

664
00:35:01,755 --> 00:35:03,468
Well, maybe he'll listen to you.

665
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:04,912
He sure doesn't listen to me.

666
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:07,539
Alright, it's going to be okay.

667
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:11,095
You go home, okay? Your
dad's got work to do.

668
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:15,958
Do you think we'll find it?

669
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:18,164
Oh, we'll give it our best shot.

670
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:39,565
- It's a steal.
- What?

671
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:41,359
The scented shaving soap.

672
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,932
It's only $4.99.

673
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,497
That is what you were
looking at, wasn't it?

674
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:47,719
Uh, yeah, yeah.

675
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:49,409
Here, take a whiff.

676
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,676
That's not bad.

677
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,888
Sandalwood. Very popular with family men.

678
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,748
The women in their lives just love it.

679
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:14,323
Oh, that's not for sale.

680
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:16,805
It's for the Santa who rings
the bell outside my shop.

681
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:19,555
I don't see him. Where is he now?

682
00:36:19,582 --> 00:36:21,401
Carl's got a touch of the flu.

683
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,307
Children's fund is going to
miss out on all those donations.

684
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,673
Yeah, well, things are tough all over.

685
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,504
I'm surprised you never
noticed Santa before.

686
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:31,726
Especially since you spend so
much time in this part of town.

687
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:36,265
I've been out and
around... window shopping.

688
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,706
Got a lot of time on my hands these days.

689
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,349
You know, with all that extra time,

690
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,147
why don't you make good use of it?

691
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:46,931
All the kids will love you.

692
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:48,689
You gotta be kidding...

693
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:51,246
It'll be a wonderful way
to show people you care.

694
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:52,536
And since you'd be right outside,

695
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:55,392
you can pop in anytime and warm
up with a cup of my mulled cider.

696
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:02,694
I wonder if it fits.

697
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:04,368
Looking at you,

698
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:06,879
I would say it's a perfect fit.

699
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:18,836
Brandon, may I have a
word with you, please?

700
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,134
Soon as I finish this level.

701
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:23,065
Hey.

702
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,958
I was just about to
show Brandon how to make

703
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:27,813
a customized Christmas ornament for Jodi.

704
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,246
Well, I'd just like to have a word with him

705
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:30,739
before the two of you get started.

706
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:31,839
Hmm.

707
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:34,749
Alone.

708
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:36,281
Ah.

709
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,239
You want the old man to take a hike.

710
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,467
It's what I need, a hike.

711
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:46,456
Why are you angry with your sister?

712
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:49,700
Cause she accused Jodi of being a thief!

713
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:52,320
According to Lori, she
never said a word to Jodi.

714
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,769
She was going to.

715
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:56,553
I guess Lori thinks that
just because Jodi's dad

716
00:37:56,564 --> 00:37:58,276
robbed a bank it runs in the family.

717
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,383
Well, Lori's very upset.
About the ring and you.

718
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:04,332
And Brandon, Jodi was
right beside that ring

719
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,311
when it disappeared.

720
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:07,379
You know, the whole town's against her.

721
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:09,425
They think she's some sort of gangster.

722
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:12,126
I expect this from Martha Tinsdale.

723
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:14,369
Not from my own father.

724
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:15,764
Brandon.

725
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:18,023
- Later.
- Hey, Brandon...

726
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,596
Hi.

727
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,698
Hi, uh...

728
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,177
maybe this isn't the best time.

729
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,380
No, there's no time like the present.

730
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,061
Alright, well, uh...

731
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,864
I have the flow of the ceremony.

732
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:36,297
I have to get a copy of this
to the minister, except...

733
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:37,302
Except what?

734
00:38:37,422 --> 00:38:39,600
Well, I'm having trouble finding one.

735
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,668
Sometimes I wonder if all
of this is going to work out.

736
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,480
Oh, it will. Trust me!

737
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:47,442
We'll find a minister and a venue,

738
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:49,089
and we'll get our license.

739
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,353
No, not that, Cassie.

740
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,786
I got Brandon mad at me,
he's fighting with his sister.

741
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,277
Lori's upset.

742
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,260
And George...

743
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,125
he's feeling like he just
wants to get away from us all.

744
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:04,448
I just want to give
everyone a family Christmas.

745
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:06,951
It's hard to have a family Christmas

746
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:09,652
when you don't have a happy
family to celebrate it.

747
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,618
Hi, thank you.

748
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:29,816
Oh, wow, so many gifts!

749
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,039
Well, it is a wedding shower, right?

750
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:34,719
Betty, I just, I can't thank you enough.

751
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,777
Oh. Wait till you try your wedding cake.

752
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,227
Oh, that reminds me!

753
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:40,258
You're going to have to sample
some of that sparkling wine

754
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:41,564
before I order it.

755
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:44,928
Betty, um...

756
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:48,525
Every woman deserves a
little sparkle in her life.

757
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:50,918
I want you to have this.

758
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:53,359
A gift? Cassie, I couldn't...

759
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:55,772
Oh, look at all those
gifts. You deserve one, too.

760
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:58,617
It is pretty, but...

761
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:00,176
It's not really my style.

762
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,521
Well, I'll tell you what.
Try it for a few days,

763
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:04,586
and if you don't like it, I'll exchange it.

764
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:07,233
You don't have to do that.

765
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:10,433
Customer satisfaction is my priority.

766
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:13,907
If you insist.

767
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:16,039
- I'll go get the wine.
- Okay.

768
00:40:19,364 --> 00:40:20,664
Yoo-hoo!

769
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,381
Season's greetings!

770
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:25,278
Oh, well, fashionably late, as usual.

771
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:27,962
- Martha, you shouldn't have.
- What?

772
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:30,561
I didn't. Your gift is on back order.

773
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:35,586
Voilà!

774
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,235
Partridges in a pear tree!

775
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,602
Wow. Do we need that?

776
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:46,945
Oh, we need several of
them. One for each table.

777
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,087
Oh, even the menu isn't that grand, Martha.

778
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:51,554
Yeah, Betty's right.
I ordered comfort food.

779
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:54,070
Oh, wedding's aren't about
comfort, for goodness sake.

780
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:55,815
If they were, people would be
getting married all the time.

781
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:57,807
Oh, I ordered your cake.

782
00:40:57,927 --> 00:40:59,878
Five tiers!

783
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:01,695
Oh, uh...

784
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:03,544
Betty's doing the cake.

785
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:05,916
Oh! Really?

786
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,444
What kind?

787
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:10,901
Well, we decided perhaps
a yellow sheet cake.

788
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:13,385
Sheet cake?

789
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,361
Oh, my dear Betty.

790
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:19,610
Cassie's cake has to be at
least as tall as the pear trees.

791
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,638
Am I right?

792
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,439
Why don't we let Betty do the cake?

793
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:24,911
I see.

794
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:26,738
Well, it's your funeral.

795
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:28,324
Oops, I mean wedding.

796
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:31,950
Martha, I so appreciate all you've done.

797
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:34,072
Do you? Do any of you?

798
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:36,216
I had a vision.

799
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:39,941
Nine ladies dancing, eight
lords a-leaping, and...

800
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:43,065
Well, a sheet cake would just
compromise the entire affair.

801
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,756
I mean, who would hire
me after that got around?

802
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,444
Nope, I'm afraid that I am
going to have to bow out.

803
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:51,489
I'm sorry to hear that, Martha.

804
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,356
Well, I couldn't have attended anyway.

805
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:57,293
I have a previous engagement!

806
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:05,006
Ho, ho, ho.

807
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:08,238
Ooh, you're feeling jolly as well, huh?

808
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:10,098
How can we have a Merry Christmas

809
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,553
if everyone's so miserable?

810
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:13,079
Everybody?

811
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:15,098
- Well, my family anyway.
- Hmm.

812
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:16,695
Including you?

813
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:18,391
Guess so.

814
00:42:18,511 --> 00:42:19,655
Why?

815
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,499
Because...

816
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,233
I don't have the...

817
00:42:26,523 --> 00:42:27,759
A dress.

818
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:29,203
For the wedding.

819
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:32,272
The one I wanted was too small.

820
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:34,826
Well, why don't we have it let out?

821
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:39,274
We're all constantly growing.

822
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:40,735
Aren't we, Lori?

823
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:46,002
Yeah, what's the rate on that room?

824
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,027
That much? Um...

825
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,538
Nothing lower?

826
00:42:51,723 --> 00:42:54,026
I thought for some reason, um,

827
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:55,574
rooms would be lower in Montreal.

828
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:58,584
I guess not.

829
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:00,387
Thanks.

830
00:43:05,464 --> 00:43:08,729
Brandon. I didn't hear you come in.

831
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,054
Montreal?

832
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:13,394
Yeah, um, a friend of mine
has a restaurant up there.

833
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:14,678
Cool.

834
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:17,096
I thought I'd go for...

835
00:43:17,353 --> 00:43:18,849
For a visit.

836
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:22,182
A long visit.

837
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:30,602
- Hello?
- Mrs. Deeks, hi, I'm Cassie Nightingale.

838
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,975
- We spoke on the phone?
- Of course, please come in.

839
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:34,275
Thanks.

840
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:37,400
Rumour has it you're the best
seamstress in all of Middleton.

841
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,849
Thank you.

842
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:40,838
I have a little emergency.

843
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,179
Uh...

844
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,653
Can you let this out two inches?

845
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:47,095
It's a very delicate material.

846
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:49,296
- Is there enough fabric?
- Let me see.

847
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:52,236
- Yes, I can do it.
- Oh, you're a life saver!

848
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:54,520
Listen, I know you have
this colour thread upstairs.

849
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:56,051
If you want to wait, it'll
only take a few minutes.

850
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,595
- Perfect!
- Please make yourself at home.

851
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:58,338
Thanks.

852
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:01,938
Dad?

853
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:07,576
Sorry, I heard voices and thought...

854
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,077
No, it's just me.

855
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,079
Your mom's fixing a dress for me.

856
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:15,691
She is going to love that spa in a box.

857
00:44:15,712 --> 00:44:16,806
Oh, yes! You know what?

858
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:19,022
I forgot to give you
something the other day.

859
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:26,981
A coin?

860
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:29,701
It's a gift.

861
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:31,932
A dollar.

862
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:34,476
- Thanks.
- It's a silver dollar.

863
00:44:35,594 --> 00:44:37,775
Is it worth more than a regular dollar?

864
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,740
Well, that depends on how you spend it.

865
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,292
Ho, ho, ho!

866
00:44:57,352 --> 00:45:00,180
Merry Christmas, Middleton!

867
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:02,456
Merry Christmas.

868
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,098
Ho, ho, ho... oh!

869
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:06,816
That's the spirit.

870
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,289
And a prosperous new year to you.

871
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,348
And to all of us.

872
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:15,218
It's only two days till Christmas,

873
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,684
and I still don't know what to get you.

874
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:17,841
That's okay.

875
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:19,753
I was going to make you
this Christmas ornament,

876
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:21,212
but... pretty lame, huh?

877
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:22,941
Brandon...

878
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,146
I'm sure I'd like just about
anything if it came from you.

879
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,451
Yeah, but...

880
00:45:29,758 --> 00:45:31,016
What do you really want?

881
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,846
I, uh... don't think there's much chance

882
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:42,756
I'll get what I really want for Christmas.

883
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:45,546
Ho, ho, ho!

884
00:45:46,065 --> 00:45:47,728
Happy holidays to you!

885
00:45:47,793 --> 00:45:49,576
Oh, thank you.

886
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:50,730
Got any change?

887
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,038
Just this.

888
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:55,966
Oh, nice coin.

889
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,607
What's it worth?

890
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,752
A dollar?

891
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:01,778
Maybe it's worth something.

892
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:02,829
I don't know.

893
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:05,428
Maybe it'll make somebody have
a better Christmas than me.

894
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:08,043
Merry Christmas, Santa.

895
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,992
Jodi?

896
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:13,052
Mommy, there's Santa!

897
00:46:13,368 --> 00:46:15,804
Can we please say hi to Santa?

898
00:46:15,821 --> 00:46:17,697
What a sweet family.

899
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:20,564
Merry Christmas, Santa.

900
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:23,026
Merry Christmas!

901
00:46:23,077 --> 00:46:25,299
Thanks, Santa. See ya.

902
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:26,933
- Bye, Santa!
- Merry Christmas.

903
00:46:28,403 --> 00:46:30,393
Merry Christmas.

904
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:56,511
Yes, I'm making truffles
for the wedding guests.

905
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:58,733
So if you could just double that order...

906
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:02,603
Yes, I know it is a lot of chocolate

907
00:47:02,616 --> 00:47:04,017
but as I always say,

908
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:05,898
you can never have too much love

909
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:07,235
or chocolate.

910
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:09,271
Oh, thank you so much.

911
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:10,835
Hello, Derek.

912
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:12,438
- Hi.
- Keeping our streets safe?

913
00:47:12,558 --> 00:47:13,900
Thanks to you.

914
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:16,259
Getting Leon in a Santa suit?

915
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:18,370
How did you manage to do that?

916
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,532
Never underestimate the magic of Santa.

917
00:47:24,498 --> 00:47:26,515
- I have your pie plates.
- Oh,

918
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,421
- how'd you like the mince pie?
- Loved it.

919
00:47:29,762 --> 00:47:32,437
Well, I'm ready for my next treat.

920
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:38,181
Evening, ma'am.

921
00:47:38,301 --> 00:47:40,753
Oh, Deputy, it's me. Betty.

922
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,728
Betty!

923
00:47:42,848 --> 00:47:45,335
Listen, I wanted to
ask you about your cake.

924
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:46,394
Which frosting?

925
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:47,608
Beautiful.

926
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:49,836
Oh, yes, it's going to be beautiful.

927
00:47:49,863 --> 00:47:51,733
But I want to know which flavour.

928
00:47:51,853 --> 00:47:53,779
No, I meant you!

929
00:47:53,899 --> 00:47:57,345
Oh, well... thank you!

930
00:47:58,106 --> 00:48:00,360
You know, after a day
of wearing this necklace,

931
00:48:00,391 --> 00:48:02,345
I just had to go buy a
new dress to go with it.

932
00:48:02,356 --> 00:48:04,593
And then I had to buy new
shoes to go with the new dress,

933
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:07,268
and then I got a new haircut
to match my new outfit,

934
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,358
and before I knew it,
I had a total make-over.

935
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,846
It's amazing how this little necklace

936
00:48:11,868 --> 00:48:13,635
inspired a whole new me.

937
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:14,904
Not new.

938
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,928
The outer sparkle just helped

939
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,001
your inner sparkle shine through.

940
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:21,753
I'll say.

941
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:25,577
I'll say chocolate frosting.

942
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:27,858
Not that it's my cake, but,

943
00:48:27,912 --> 00:48:30,089
you know, I'm sure
whatever cake you make is...

944
00:48:30,686 --> 00:48:31,938
is going to be great.

945
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,961
Thank you, Derek.

946
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:40,033
Um... I'm going to go back to my bake shop.

947
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:42,046
I'll, uh, I'll walk you.

948
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,562
Okay.

949
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:46,325
Say, what are you doing Christmas Day?

950
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:19,878
Cassie, you're really
doing a good job on those.

951
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:21,169
Thank you.

952
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:22,741
Mmm, thanks.

953
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:29,527
I got our wedding license.

954
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:32,997
What?! That's terrific! Really?

955
00:49:33,408 --> 00:49:35,468
- How?
- I just told the county clerk

956
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:37,297
that you'd been paying
state and federal taxes

957
00:49:37,314 --> 00:49:39,065
under the name Cassandra
Nightingale for years

958
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:41,313
and that if it was good enough
for the Internal Revenue Service

959
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:42,779
then who were they to say otherwise?

960
00:49:42,828 --> 00:49:45,109
Brilliant! We're on a roll!

961
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:47,664
Now all we have to do is figure
out a place to have the wedding.

962
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:49,551
Well, what happened to the garden club?

963
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:52,274
Well, they won't let us use
their solarium for the wedding.

964
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:54,571
Something about the
body heat from the guests

965
00:49:54,588 --> 00:49:56,283
wilting the lilies.

966
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:57,645
That's ridiculous!

967
00:49:57,765 --> 00:49:59,466
Well, they've got a point.

968
00:50:00,002 --> 00:50:01,226
You and I have a way of

969
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:03,755
raising the temperature all by ourselves.

970
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:08,596
Jake...

971
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:09,625
lighten up!

972
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,010
Sorry, it's just...

973
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,345
It's Christmas.

974
00:50:13,613 --> 00:50:16,288
Everything's either booked
or closed for the holidays.

975
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:18,979
Well, not to worry.

976
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,117
I have a plan.

977
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:22,201
Yeah, you always do.

978
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:24,553
I also have our minister.

979
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:27,003
He's happy to drive down from Lakeville.

980
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:28,830
Apparently he and George go way back.

981
00:50:29,054 --> 00:50:30,783
Yeah, George...

982
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,339
He's talking about moving.

983
00:50:32,341 --> 00:50:33,641
To Montreal.

984
00:50:33,643 --> 00:50:35,432
He's got a friend that
owns a restaurant there.

985
00:50:35,454 --> 00:50:37,035
What? But...

986
00:50:37,155 --> 00:50:38,530
You and the kids have to get together

987
00:50:38,556 --> 00:50:40,048
and figure out a way to talk him out of it.

988
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:41,909
Cassie, we're not even talking.

989
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,024
Well, I've got to get back to work.

990
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:57,076
Why don't you stop for a cup of
coffee on your way to keep warm?

991
00:51:02,857 --> 00:51:04,250
What?

992
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,925
What's that smile about?

993
00:51:06,216 --> 00:51:08,840
I just remembered that I'm
marrying you on Christmas Eve.

994
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,435
Just a coffee, please.

995
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:25,249
Betty!

996
00:51:25,743 --> 00:51:28,247
Just the usual, Chief Russell?

997
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:31,460
Yes. The, uh...

998
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,909
Okay.

999
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:38,811
Well.

1000
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:41,717
Is this seat taken?

1001
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,367
It is now, I guess.

1002
00:51:46,487 --> 00:51:48,126
Brandon...

1003
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,093
You can't still be mad at me.

1004
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:51,570
Why not?

1005
00:51:51,596 --> 00:51:53,363
You still think Jodi's a thief.

1006
00:51:53,365 --> 00:51:54,877
I never said that.

1007
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,518
It's tough on Jodi.

1008
00:51:57,057 --> 00:51:59,254
She has such a big heart.

1009
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:02,826
She hides it cause she
has this rep around school.

1010
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:05,509
All because her dad was in prison.

1011
00:52:08,263 --> 00:52:10,151
You know, I was beginning
to think that you were

1012
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:12,143
very close-minded. But you're not.

1013
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,844
Not when it comes to your friend.

1014
00:52:16,621 --> 00:52:19,066
She's funny. And fun, you know?

1015
00:52:19,382 --> 00:52:20,972
The things she says,

1016
00:52:20,989 --> 00:52:22,715
the way she dresses.

1017
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:24,349
She's different.

1018
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:25,717
In a good way.

1019
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:29,114
That's why I like her so much.

1020
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,084
Who does that remind you of?

1021
00:52:32,738 --> 00:52:34,680
Your friend, Jodi.

1022
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:37,744
She sounds an awful lot like
the woman that I'm gonna marry.

1023
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:40,513
For all the same reasons.

1024
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:46,011
Christmas special?

1025
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,665
They, uh... top it with
red and green sprinkles.

1026
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:54,996
Well, you let me pay for that.

1027
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:56,856
Cassie already did.

1028
00:52:57,246 --> 00:52:58,627
Really?

1029
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,493
Yeah.

1030
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:02,093
She sent me down here.

1031
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:04,295
Said I deserved a treat.

1032
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:19,857
So, what brings you here, George?

1033
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:22,417
My feet.

1034
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,622
I was just out for a long walk,

1035
00:53:24,647 --> 00:53:26,767
and I thought I'd knock on your door.

1036
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,493
Is this herbal tea?

1037
00:53:29,536 --> 00:53:32,108
No, something stronger. Irish breakfast.

1038
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:34,655
Oh. How'd you guess Mr. O'Hanrahan

1039
00:53:34,663 --> 00:53:36,099
would be paying you a visit?

1040
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,927
I always feel welcome here.

1041
00:53:39,577 --> 00:53:41,432
Hmm, Grey House.

1042
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,483
Dear old Grey House.

1043
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:45,833
Something wrong, Cassie?

1044
00:53:46,064 --> 00:53:49,680
Oh, it's just an old house
and it needs a lot of TLC.

1045
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:50,927
It's a big responsibility.

1046
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,645
Well, you're up to it.

1047
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:56,063
After the wedding, Jake and I
will be staying at his house,

1048
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:57,995
and I can't be two places at once.

1049
00:53:58,448 --> 00:53:59,593
Are you sure?

1050
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:01,468
Now, George...

1051
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:05,516
Hmm... maybe running a B&B is...

1052
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:07,069
a hands-on job.

1053
00:54:08,074 --> 00:54:10,074
And half the time I won't be here.

1054
00:54:10,194 --> 00:54:13,010
Oh, I want to hold on to Grey House, but...

1055
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:16,443
But without the B&B income,
I'm just not so sure anymore.

1056
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:21,215
Ah, but I've been doing
all the talking. So...

1057
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,349
is there something on your mind?

1058
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:26,275
Oh, nothing.

1059
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:28,970
It's funny how, uh...

1060
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:32,101
a long walk sometimes will clear your mind.

1061
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,789
Want a cup of coffee, Chief?

1062
00:55:02,277 --> 00:55:03,935
No, thanks.

1063
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:06,362
Are you sure? You look a little tired.

1064
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:08,430
I'm fine.

1065
00:55:08,747 --> 00:55:11,063
- You working overtime?
- Yeah.

1066
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:13,559
You've been out here almost every day.

1067
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:15,465
Yeah, that's right.

1068
00:55:15,739 --> 00:55:17,585
Except tomorrow.

1069
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,590
Cause you're getting married.

1070
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:23,029
I got that covered, too, Leon.

1071
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:26,620
Yeah, I bet you do.

1072
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,423
Well, we'll see you around, huh?

1073
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:45,938
Ho, ho, ho!

1074
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:47,938
Merry Christmas!

1075
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:50,946
Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!

1076
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:53,211
Thank you very much.

1077
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,210
Got the dress! It's all fixed up!

1078
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,475
And ready for the big night.

1079
00:56:12,715 --> 00:56:15,621
Oh. Thanks.

1080
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:19,535
It's not about the dress, is it?

1081
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,372
Lori, you can tell me anything.

1082
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:29,091
I don't have the ring.

1083
00:56:30,852 --> 00:56:35,196
I lost it. You gave it to
me, you trusted me, and...

1084
00:56:36,715 --> 00:56:38,604
I let you down.

1085
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:41,185
Oh, honey. No tears.

1086
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:42,621
Okay?

1087
00:56:42,647 --> 00:56:45,065
But you told me it belonged to your mother.

1088
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:47,655
You said it was all you had
left from your old family!

1089
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:51,151
I have my memories.

1090
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:53,741
And those can never be lost.

1091
00:56:55,698 --> 00:56:57,690
And now,

1092
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:00,143
I have my new family, too.

1093
00:57:00,981 --> 00:57:03,715
So let me tell you something
about that old ring.

1094
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:08,099
It has a mind of its own.

1095
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:12,860
I've misplaced it before and that ring...

1096
00:57:12,894 --> 00:57:15,492
always finds its way back to me.

1097
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,547
- Hello, Miss Nightingale.
- Hello, Martha.

1098
00:57:33,428 --> 00:57:35,811
If you've come to ask
me back, I'm afraid...

1099
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:37,408
Well, I didn't come for that.

1100
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:38,338
I was wondering if you had

1101
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:40,224
those colour swatches that you showed me.

1102
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,163
I might.

1103
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:46,930
I was ordering table cloths,

1104
00:57:46,944 --> 00:57:49,129
and there was this one shade of ivory...

1105
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:51,509
Oh, yes, here it is.

1106
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:52,185
Yes!

1107
00:57:53,302 --> 00:57:54,706
What on Earth is this?

1108
00:57:56,926 --> 00:57:58,508
My ring!

1109
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:02,281
How did it get in there?

1110
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:05,944
Well, what matters is you
found it, Martha thank you!

1111
00:58:06,064 --> 00:58:07,708
Heavens that day in your shop.

1112
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:10,057
I emptied my purse on your counter

1113
00:58:10,215 --> 00:58:12,105
and after I swept everything up again

1114
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:13,051
I must have...

1115
00:58:16,123 --> 00:58:17,846
I feel just terrible!

1116
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:21,128
You're not... angry?

1117
00:58:21,653 --> 00:58:22,982
Of course not.

1118
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,702
I suppose I shouldn't
have quit on you like that.

1119
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,934
Leaving you high and dry
at the very last minute? Oh,

1120
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,384
I had such an extraordinary event

1121
00:58:32,406 --> 00:58:33,773
planned for the two of you.

1122
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:34,840
I know!

1123
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,033
That's why I recommended
you to a wealthy client

1124
00:58:37,044 --> 00:58:38,461
who's getting married in the spring.

1125
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:39,446
You did?

1126
00:58:39,495 --> 00:58:42,399
You have such energy,
Martha, and enthusiasm.

1127
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:44,428
You're bursting with creative ideas!

1128
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:47,081
And I think the job pays well, too.

1129
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:50,483
What a lovely, unexpected gesture.

1130
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:51,954
Why unexpected?

1131
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:54,361
Well, for you to think
of me after all that I...

1132
00:58:55,455 --> 00:58:57,791
Well, it is the season where
we think of others first,

1133
00:58:57,835 --> 00:58:58,770
don't we?

1134
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:02,003
I don't know what to say!

1135
00:59:02,402 --> 00:59:05,695
I know you and the Mayor have
other plans for Christmas Eve.

1136
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,282
But the invitation is still open.

1137
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:10,224
After all that I've done?

1138
00:59:10,454 --> 00:59:12,811
Ah, but there's so much
more to do, isn't there?

1139
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:19,288
Well, if your plans change...

1140
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,710
we'd love to see you there.

1141
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:23,221
Merry Christmas, Martha.

1142
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,645
And to you.

1143
00:59:31,558 --> 00:59:32,701
Brandon!

1144
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,704
Cassie found her ring.

1145
00:59:36,257 --> 00:59:37,498
That's good.

1146
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,415
So now you must feel just great.

1147
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:43,111
Pretty good.

1148
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,287
Not great.

1149
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:45,692
Why not?

1150
00:59:46,398 --> 00:59:48,562
I went to see Jodi behind your back.

1151
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:51,403
Maybe I should have just told
you what was bothering me.

1152
00:59:51,753 --> 00:59:53,600
That's what big brothers are for, right?

1153
00:59:54,395 --> 00:59:56,556
You're more than my brother, right?

1154
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,339
You're my friend.

1155
00:59:59,072 --> 00:59:59,958
Aren't you?

1156
01:00:00,423 --> 01:00:01,380
Yeah.

1157
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,781
Yeah, I am.

1158
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:07,462
Maybe I didn't act like one, though.

1159
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,619
Sorry.

1160
01:00:26,732 --> 01:00:29,108
Official wedding photographer,
reporting for duty.

1161
01:00:29,518 --> 01:00:31,091
Look at you!

1162
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,740
Wow!

1163
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:36,056
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1164
01:00:37,355 --> 01:00:38,629
Where's Jodi?

1165
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:40,269
I'm going to go get her.

1166
01:00:40,996 --> 01:00:42,859
I hope she has a good time tonight.

1167
01:00:42,979 --> 01:00:45,662
- Christmas is never much fun for her.
- Hmm.

1168
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:47,611
Never say never.

1169
01:00:48,987 --> 01:00:51,646
- Where are you going?
- Oh, down to the shop.

1170
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:54,287
Don't you have a wedding to get to?

1171
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:56,175
Yeah, I forgot my sage.

1172
01:00:56,226 --> 01:00:57,730
Jodi and I could get it for you.

1173
01:00:57,756 --> 01:01:00,106
- Would you?
- Yeah, it's on the way.

1174
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:01,714
Oh, thanks!

1175
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:03,979
Alright, just a small bunch of dried sage.

1176
01:01:04,026 --> 01:01:05,886
I want to burn a little
before the ceremony.

1177
01:01:06,006 --> 01:01:07,104
Clear the air.

1178
01:01:07,343 --> 01:01:09,401
Make way for new beginnings.

1179
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:13,360
Here you go.

1180
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:14,775
Okay.

1181
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:28,134
Cassie?

1182
01:01:28,138 --> 01:01:29,647
About your cake...

1183
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:31,691
I am so sorry.

1184
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:33,599
Um, it was in the back of my van,

1185
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:36,149
and unfortunately, so was
my neighbour's dachshund...

1186
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:37,267
Oh, no!

1187
01:01:37,387 --> 01:01:40,121
Yeah! This tiny dog ate the entire thing!

1188
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:42,418
Now I am trying to get you another one,

1189
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:44,130
but I am totally sold out.

1190
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,572
And every other bakery from
here to the state capitol

1191
01:01:46,574 --> 01:01:47,528
closed at noon.

1192
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:49,016
Betty, put it out of your mind.

1193
01:01:49,136 --> 01:01:51,152
You get back to all the
other items on your menu.

1194
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:52,824
But it's your wedding cake!

1195
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:54,036
What'll we do?!

1196
01:01:54,941 --> 01:01:56,981
Well, the first thing to realize is that...

1197
01:01:57,352 --> 01:02:00,320
baking is about mixing
together the right ingredients.

1198
01:02:02,716 --> 01:02:04,588
I have no idea what you're saying.

1199
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,665
Then look at it this way:

1200
01:02:06,877 --> 01:02:09,407
you just brought great joy
to a dachshund this Christmas.

1201
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:25,708
Hello?

1202
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,165
Hello, George?

1203
01:02:27,397 --> 01:02:30,058
Um, do you have cake mix?

1204
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,485
I'll have to check... why?

1205
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:35,651
Well, I need a wedding cake for 35 guests

1206
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:37,715
in, um... two hours.

1207
01:02:39,779 --> 01:02:41,072
Uh, George?

1208
01:02:41,092 --> 01:02:42,419
I'm here, uh...

1209
01:02:42,614 --> 01:02:45,414
A little shocked, but I'm still standing.

1210
01:02:46,336 --> 01:02:49,460
Maybe Lori could help
you move things along?

1211
01:02:50,255 --> 01:02:52,223
I'm counting on you two.

1212
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:54,835
Okay...

1213
01:02:55,326 --> 01:02:56,606
Great.

1214
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:01,906
Do you know how to tie one of these?

1215
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:03,513
George?

1216
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,689
Are you there?

1217
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:06,790
Was that Cassie?

1218
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:09,059
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

1219
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:10,961
What does she want?

1220
01:03:11,894 --> 01:03:13,145
A miracle.

1221
01:03:20,538 --> 01:03:21,843
Derek?

1222
01:03:22,116 --> 01:03:24,195
Chief, I found Leon's car.

1223
01:03:24,236 --> 01:03:25,638
But I can't find him!

1224
01:03:25,644 --> 01:03:28,345
Okay, stay on Main Street,

1225
01:03:28,557 --> 01:03:30,144
stay with the car.

1226
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,782
As long as you have the
car, he's not going anywhere.

1227
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:33,760
You got it?

1228
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,285
Copy that, Jake.

1229
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:39,292
No cake mix?

1230
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:41,172
Even if we had all the ingredients,

1231
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,280
there's not enough time.

1232
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,755
Hey, I know it looks impossible,

1233
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:44,661
but don't forget you've got

1234
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,528
George "Never Say Die"
O'Hanrahan in your corner!

1235
01:03:49,677 --> 01:03:51,362
So, what are you going to do?

1236
01:03:52,486 --> 01:03:53,459
Beats me.

1237
01:03:55,296 --> 01:03:56,561
Derek?

1238
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:00,709
Yeah, hi.

1239
01:04:01,063 --> 01:04:02,018
How are you?

1240
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,548
Really?

1241
01:04:05,668 --> 01:04:07,467
You don't have any other way to...

1242
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:08,989
No?

1243
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,917
No, it's not your fault, no.

1244
01:04:13,536 --> 01:04:14,713
Merry Christmas.

1245
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,374
I hate to ask.

1246
01:04:19,987 --> 01:04:21,562
That was the minister.

1247
01:04:21,682 --> 01:04:24,127
His car broke down, he has
no other way to get here.

1248
01:04:24,247 --> 01:04:26,298
Maybe Derek could shoot
up there in the squad car?

1249
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:27,742
No, Derek's on duty.

1250
01:04:27,803 --> 01:04:29,964
Even if he could drive 100 miles an hour,

1251
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:32,362
it's a round trip he'd
still never make it on time.

1252
01:04:32,393 --> 01:04:34,130
Well, ask people to wait.

1253
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:36,034
Maybe we can serve them these cookies.

1254
01:04:36,244 --> 01:04:39,499
Oh, honey, we can't do that to
people. Not on Christmas Eve.

1255
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,517
What good is a marriage license

1256
01:04:43,637 --> 01:04:45,924
if we don't have a
minister to tie the knot?

1257
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:52,388
Robert Kowalski and Teresa Quinn?

1258
01:04:52,508 --> 01:04:53,740
- Who?
- Who?

1259
01:04:54,585 --> 01:04:56,252
The names on your wedding license.

1260
01:04:58,703 --> 01:05:00,611
Well, they must have
given me the wrong one!

1261
01:05:01,412 --> 01:05:03,590
I've been so busy, I didn't
even bother to open it!

1262
01:05:03,795 --> 01:05:04,628
Jake...

1263
01:05:04,658 --> 01:05:05,721
That's it.

1264
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:07,279
The wedding's off.

1265
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,899
No, it can't be!

1266
01:05:09,498 --> 01:05:11,109
I'll have to speak to Cassie.

1267
01:05:13,972 --> 01:05:15,533
Do you know this would be the first promise

1268
01:05:15,563 --> 01:05:16,771
I've ever broken to her?

1269
01:06:33,538 --> 01:06:34,906
Only be a minute.

1270
01:06:34,906 --> 01:06:36,538
Oh, no problem.

1271
01:06:47,624 --> 01:06:49,709
She said a small bunch of dried sage.

1272
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:52,379
Hanging from the ceilings.

1273
01:06:52,722 --> 01:06:56,370
Um, don't most people
usually hang mistletoe?

1274
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,849
Cassie says it makes
way for new beginnings.

1275
01:07:02,157 --> 01:07:04,328
I wish my family could
make a new beginning.

1276
01:07:06,525 --> 01:07:07,824
What do you mean?

1277
01:07:08,721 --> 01:07:11,798
You're so lucky to have your
family and a dad like Jake.

1278
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:13,114
I used to.

1279
01:07:13,593 --> 01:07:15,337
When I was little, ten years ago.

1280
01:07:16,773 --> 01:07:18,764
You remember that far back?

1281
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:21,088
Like it was yesterday.

1282
01:07:21,668 --> 01:07:23,535
Me and my dad laughing...

1283
01:07:23,655 --> 01:07:26,638
I'd stand on his shoes and
he'd waltz me around the room.

1284
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:30,080
I keep those memories up here.

1285
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,405
Locked away like treasure.

1286
01:07:32,772 --> 01:07:34,849
I take them out at
night before I go to bed,

1287
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:38,268
and that's why I remember him so well.

1288
01:07:53,017 --> 01:07:55,086
Do you want to go to the party now?

1289
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:56,675
Sure.

1290
01:08:53,725 --> 01:08:55,454
Cassie...

1291
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:58,215
Jake, don't you know it's
bad luck to see the bride

1292
01:08:58,215 --> 01:09:00,035
before the wedding?

1293
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:02,480
I know.

1294
01:09:07,334 --> 01:09:08,830
Honey...

1295
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:11,556
we can't get married.

1296
01:09:11,676 --> 01:09:14,654
Greetings!

1297
01:09:14,774 --> 01:09:17,577
Martha, Tom, so glad you made it.

1298
01:09:18,295 --> 01:09:21,056
There's something I have to tell you.

1299
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:24,056
We've run into some
roadblocks and I'm afraid...

1300
01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:26,227
Ah, yes. The wedding.

1301
01:09:26,347 --> 01:09:27,756
Wh... what's this?

1302
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:29,808
I got a call from my friend
at the county office about

1303
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:32,276
a mix-up, so Martha and I ran
over and straightened it out.

1304
01:09:32,337 --> 01:09:33,404
Our wedding license!

1305
01:09:33,404 --> 01:09:34,848
They want to know if by any chance

1306
01:09:34,865 --> 01:09:36,386
they gave you a different license?

1307
01:09:37,567 --> 01:09:40,009
Cause there is a very
anxious couple named Kowalski

1308
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,020
in Lakeville who want to get married

1309
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,357
two days after Christmas.

1310
01:09:42,388 --> 01:09:44,562
Well, we can send it with the
minister after our ceremony.

1311
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:45,567
Uh,

1312
01:09:45,966 --> 01:09:47,111
the minister can't make it.

1313
01:09:47,913 --> 01:09:48,549
Why?

1314
01:09:48,612 --> 01:09:49,547
Car trouble.

1315
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:52,351
So, even if we have this license,

1316
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,414
I don't see...

1317
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,022
Well, you don't, but I do.

1318
01:09:55,521 --> 01:09:57,119
I'll get someone to marry you!

1319
01:09:57,201 --> 01:09:58,461
In the next five minutes?

1320
01:09:58,535 --> 01:10:00,422
My dear, I happen to have...

1321
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:01,608
connections.

1322
01:10:02,287 --> 01:10:04,023
- Me?
- Yes, you!

1323
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,743
By the power vested in
you, etcetera, etcetera!

1324
01:10:06,753 --> 01:10:07,615
Why not?

1325
01:10:07,878 --> 01:10:09,057
Well, it's been a while.

1326
01:10:09,737 --> 01:10:10,675
Well, Mayor...

1327
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:12,556
You can take those.

1328
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,379
I know what I want to say.

1329
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:17,830
Martha, thank you.

1330
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,791
Thank you for everything!

1331
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:21,261
Everything?

1332
01:10:21,478 --> 01:10:22,571
Whatever do you mean?

1333
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,740
Well, you got us our license,

1334
01:10:25,074 --> 01:10:26,226
our officiate,

1335
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:27,482
and the venue.

1336
01:10:28,637 --> 01:10:30,643
Do you remember when you told
me that the Heritage Society

1337
01:10:30,657 --> 01:10:32,716
was winding down for the holidays?

1338
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:36,262
You really are a great
wedding planner, Martha!

1339
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:38,043
Well, anyway...

1340
01:10:38,089 --> 01:10:40,259
It's time for you two to
start your new life together.

1341
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,477
Jake, would you escort our guests?

1342
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,021
With pleasure.

1343
01:10:57,424 --> 01:10:59,979
Cassie did a wonderful job.

1344
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:02,526
It's a beautiful room.

1345
01:11:34,802 --> 01:11:37,187
Who gives this woman to
be married to this man?

1346
01:11:37,307 --> 01:11:38,965
I do.

1347
01:11:55,265 --> 01:11:57,034
Dear friends and family,

1348
01:11:57,154 --> 01:11:59,556
we are gathered here today
to witness the loving union

1349
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,787
of Jake Russell and Cassandra Nightingale

1350
01:12:01,812 --> 01:12:03,547
in the sacred bond of marriage.

1351
01:12:21,263 --> 01:12:24,614
Jake, please place the
ring on Cassie's finger.

1352
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:37,127
Cassie, with this ring

1353
01:12:37,511 --> 01:12:41,272
I give you all that I am and ever will be.

1354
01:12:41,981 --> 01:12:45,546
With this ring, I thee wed.

1355
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:49,870
Cassie, please put the
ring on Jake's finger.

1356
01:12:55,099 --> 01:12:57,715
As I place this ring on your finger,

1357
01:12:57,835 --> 01:13:00,749
I give you all that I am and ever will be.

1358
01:13:01,535 --> 01:13:05,031
With this ring, I thee wed.

1359
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:12,502
At this time,

1360
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,280
Jake and Cassie would like to
say their own vows to each other.

1361
01:13:17,835 --> 01:13:20,282
Cassie, not long ago you came into my life.

1362
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:23,476
And nothing has been the same since.

1363
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:28,400
Words can't easily express
all that you've given me.

1364
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:31,638
In fact, I can only think of one.

1365
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:34,313
Magic.

1366
01:13:37,602 --> 01:13:39,169
I love you.

1367
01:13:45,438 --> 01:13:47,361
Um, Jake...

1368
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:51,669
You gave me a home when I had none,

1369
01:13:51,789 --> 01:13:54,208
a home in your heart.

1370
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:57,345
And you gave me a family

1371
01:13:57,781 --> 01:14:00,182
when I had none.

1372
01:14:00,926 --> 01:14:03,181
And I will love and cherish them

1373
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:06,258
as I will love and cherish you.

1374
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:10,387
Doesn't take a crystal ball to know

1375
01:14:10,771 --> 01:14:12,789
that you and I will be
each other's strength

1376
01:14:12,832 --> 01:14:14,892
and hope and joy.

1377
01:14:16,678 --> 01:14:18,080
And, um...

1378
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:20,789
this is my promise to you.

1379
01:14:21,106 --> 01:14:24,217
A love that's never going to end.

1380
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:30,611
By the authority vested in
me as Mayor of Middleton,

1381
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:34,363
it gives me great pleasure to
pronounce you husband and wife.

1382
01:14:36,886 --> 01:14:40,100
Jake, you may kiss your bride.

1383
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:03,614
I've got something to show you.

1384
01:15:08,623 --> 01:15:10,674
Is this... a wedding cake?

1385
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,947
It's a cookie cake.

1386
01:15:11,998 --> 01:15:13,973
I took all the baked goods at hand

1387
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,369
and Lori and I used icing
to hold it all together.

1388
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:19,366
Oh, George, what would we do without you?

1389
01:15:20,297 --> 01:15:21,622
Cassie...

1390
01:15:21,844 --> 01:15:23,879
what if I stayed here?

1391
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:26,699
In Middleton? That would be great, George.

1392
01:15:26,734 --> 01:15:28,383
Not just Middleton.

1393
01:15:28,503 --> 01:15:30,160
In Grey House.

1394
01:15:30,383 --> 01:15:32,058
I could run the place.

1395
01:15:32,314 --> 01:15:34,136
What an interesting idea.

1396
01:15:34,383 --> 01:15:36,136
Well, I got it from you.

1397
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,939
- Did you really?
- When you said

1398
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:39,682
you couldn't be in two places at...

1399
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:41,998
... once.

1400
01:15:44,922 --> 01:15:46,683
You know, it's a big job.

1401
01:15:46,896 --> 01:15:48,854
I could use a big job right now.

1402
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:50,281
On one condition.

1403
01:15:50,401 --> 01:15:51,683
You wouldn't do all the work alone.

1404
01:15:51,726 --> 01:15:53,794
We'd be equal partners.

1405
01:15:59,051 --> 01:16:00,624
If you'll excuse me,

1406
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:03,589
I need to welcome all my guests.

1407
01:16:17,883 --> 01:16:20,259
Won't you come in?

1408
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,814
How'd you know I was out here?

1409
01:16:23,934 --> 01:16:27,515
Well, you weren't in there, so I
thought maybe you were out here.

1410
01:16:28,967 --> 01:16:32,608
Well, I, uh... came to get my little girl.

1411
01:16:33,446 --> 01:16:36,831
Family is a very powerful force
this time of year, isn't it?

1412
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:41,113
I don't exactly have a family anymore.

1413
01:16:41,147 --> 01:16:42,592
Oh, Leon.

1414
01:16:42,712 --> 01:16:44,703
Where there's love, there's family.

1415
01:16:45,711 --> 01:16:47,959
You don't have to keep running.

1416
01:16:48,344 --> 01:16:50,712
So, come in from the cold.

1417
01:16:50,746 --> 01:16:52,533
Whenever you're ready.

1418
01:17:11,976 --> 01:17:14,019
- Thank you, Betty.
- You're welcome.

1419
01:17:14,643 --> 01:17:16,732
Isn't she a lovely bride?

1420
01:17:16,852 --> 01:17:19,156
Hope I'm not late for dinner...

1421
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:21,882
Gwen?

1422
01:17:22,002 --> 01:17:23,352
Hello, George.

1423
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,993
I thought only Cassie popped up like this.

1424
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,399
I brought my daughter and
grandchildren with me for a visit.

1425
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,252
They've never seen snow, but...

1426
01:17:31,491 --> 01:17:34,117
now the weather station
says no snow this Christmas!

1427
01:17:34,138 --> 01:17:35,437
Well, they're wrong.

1428
01:17:35,471 --> 01:17:38,066
Cassie's forecast is for snow. Tonight.

1429
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:41,012
- Well, I hope she's right.
- You can bet on it.

1430
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:44,020
Is snow the only reason you came back?

1431
01:17:44,747 --> 01:17:47,354
You're the only reason I needed, George.

1432
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:49,722
I guess you haven't heard, but...

1433
01:17:49,927 --> 01:17:51,320
after the honeymoon,

1434
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,765
I'm moving into Grey House.

1435
01:17:53,885 --> 01:17:55,363
Really, George?

1436
01:17:55,406 --> 01:17:56,448
It's a big house.

1437
01:17:56,474 --> 01:17:58,363
- I know.
- Lot's of room...

1438
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:00,439
Yes, yes, there is.

1439
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:03,542
It can use some of my Irish hospitality.

1440
01:18:03,662 --> 01:18:05,277
No doubt.

1441
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:13,575
There we go.

1442
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:17,763
Excuse me?

1443
01:18:24,063 --> 01:18:25,516
I wanted to give you this.

1444
01:18:27,046 --> 01:18:28,738
It's all there.

1445
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,321
The money from the Shelbyville Bank job.

1446
01:18:33,789 --> 01:18:36,054
It was hidden under the floor of your shop.

1447
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,473
Cassie's shop?

1448
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:41,841
Yeah, well, it wasn't a
shop when I stashed it there.

1449
01:18:42,072 --> 01:18:44,235
It was just an abandoned building.

1450
01:18:45,191 --> 01:18:46,644
Okay.

1451
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:49,585
This isn't exactly the right time or place.

1452
01:18:49,636 --> 01:18:51,063
No, it is the time.

1453
01:18:51,959 --> 01:18:54,269
Cause I want my little
girl to see me do it.

1454
01:19:00,246 --> 01:19:02,887
I had a plan to win Jodi back.

1455
01:19:03,734 --> 01:19:05,255
I figured I could convince her

1456
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:06,838
to run away and live with her dad.

1457
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:10,136
But then I realized...

1458
01:19:10,427 --> 01:19:12,392
that you can't buy love.

1459
01:19:15,837 --> 01:19:17,914
And I don't want to run anymore.

1460
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,709
So how do we know this
isn't just another con?

1461
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,350
It's not a crime to return the money.

1462
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,777
And Leon has done his time.

1463
01:19:31,111 --> 01:19:34,410
Look, I know I've made
some big mistakes, alright?

1464
01:19:34,974 --> 01:19:36,658
And I know it's going to
take time for everybody

1465
01:19:36,701 --> 01:19:38,179
to trust me again.

1466
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:42,050
But I'm going to stay right
here and do whatever it takes.

1467
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:45,913
Cause I want that second chance.

1468
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:48,247
I want a family again.

1469
01:19:52,665 --> 01:19:56,127
Jodi, I've never had
anything but love for you.

1470
01:19:56,973 --> 01:19:59,503
And I know how much I hurt you.

1471
01:20:00,132 --> 01:20:01,947
I saw the hurt in your eyes the other night

1472
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:04,708
when you dropped the
silver dollar off for Santa.

1473
01:20:06,315 --> 01:20:09,238
You were watching that family
on the street, weren't you?

1474
01:20:10,109 --> 01:20:12,588
That happy family.

1475
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:16,844
And that's all you
really want for Christmas.

1476
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,425
Not this... money.

1477
01:20:22,676 --> 01:20:24,510
You said it yourself, angel.

1478
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:26,621
I was a god guy once.

1479
01:20:28,348 --> 01:20:30,775
So can you let me be that guy again?

1480
01:20:44,843 --> 01:20:46,638
A second chance.

1481
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:52,373
I guess a second chance is worth a try.

1482
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:58,117
Jake!

1483
01:20:58,237 --> 01:21:01,339
I put a lock on his car, he
can't go anywhere. He's...

1484
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:06,228
He's... right here.

1485
01:21:06,245 --> 01:21:07,570
Yep.

1486
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:13,954
Uh, Chief?

1487
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,972
Does this mean that I'm off duty now?

1488
01:21:16,186 --> 01:21:18,442
Well, Derek, you put this in the lock-up.

1489
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:21,605
Then do whatever you want.

1490
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:25,297
So...

1491
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:28,742
what do you say we get an early
start on that Christmas date?

1492
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,486
I'll save you a seat at dinner tonight.

1493
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:39,623
Would this be a good time
to say "Merry Christmas"?

1494
01:21:39,743 --> 01:21:41,580
It's going to be a very merry Christmas,

1495
01:21:41,618 --> 01:21:42,984
cause tomorrow morning...

1496
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:45,239
I'm going to wake up with my family.

1497
01:21:46,828 --> 01:21:49,316
Do you know the moment that
I fell in love with you?

1498
01:21:50,684 --> 01:21:54,328
It was when I first saw
you come down your stairs.

1499
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:59,137
Well, it took me a little
longer to fall in love with you.

1500
01:21:59,718 --> 01:22:03,308
It was when I reached
the bottom of my stairs.

1501
01:22:05,138 --> 01:22:07,650
Of course, I didn't know what I was in for.

1502
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:09,257
Well...

1503
01:22:09,574 --> 01:22:11,052
you still don't.

1504
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:21,323
Cassie!

1505
01:22:27,314 --> 01:22:29,682
You are a bundle of Christmas surprises.

1506
01:22:29,802 --> 01:22:32,298
Well, there's a lot more
where that came from.

1507
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:34,905
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1508
01:22:40,648 --> 01:22:43,750
Look, it's snowing, just
like Cassie said it would.

1509
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,537
How did...

1510
01:22:48,913 --> 01:22:50,776
Magic happens.

1511
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:28,903
