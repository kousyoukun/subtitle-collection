1
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,699
It scares us just thinking about it.

2
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,979
When you hear it, you're gonna
think we're insane.

3
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,931
Try us. Please, from the start.

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,651
It started out small,

5
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:39,059
like a hand or a leg was
in a different position.

6
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,739
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

7
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,939
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

8
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,659
It was moving around by itself.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,979
Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,964
That's exactly what we thought.

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,979
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,899
And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,459
Yes.

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,163
Camilla got in touch with a medium.

15
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,339
We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl

16
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,419
named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,441
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,899
All she wanted was to be friends.

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,379
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,331
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,806
So...

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,299
we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,602
Wait, you did what?

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,259
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

25
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,619
We said yes.

26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,321
But then things got worse.

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,691
God.

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,539
When we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,286
But we had left her in the spare room.

30
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,282
Debbie! Debbie, wait!

31
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,979
We are beyond terrified.

32
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,251
We don't know what's going on
or what to do. Can you help us?

33
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,845
Yes, we can.

34
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,179
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.

35
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,419
Ghosts don't possess such power.

36
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,219
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.

37
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,488
It's something inhuman.

38
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,019
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

39
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,379
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

40
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,411
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

41
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,809
What's an inhuman spirit?

42
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,847
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

43
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,129
It's something demonic.

44
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,979
So the doll was never possessed?

45
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,059
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

46
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,539
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

47
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,526
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

48
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,762
It wanted to get inside of you.

49
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,522
All right, that's good, Drew.
You can shut it down now.

50
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,361
Hit the lights.

51
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,339
So we got the church
to send a priest over...

52
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,579
to bless the house and the occupants.

53
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,566
Whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no longer with them. Any questions?

54
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,579
Yes.

55
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,379
Where's the doll now?

56
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,444
Someplace safe.

57
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,779
- Yep.
- So, what are you guys?

58
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,889
I mean, what do people call you?

59
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,699
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.
That's one name for us.

60
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,579
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

61
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,019
Kooks.

62
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,619
Wackos.

63
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,084
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

64
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,165
Here we are.

65
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,619
Wow, hear that?

66
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,419
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

67
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,819
Oh. Ha!

68
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,259
- Okay. Guys, we are here!
- Get out of the car.

69
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,299
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

70
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,539
Are you so excited? Where's my "yes"?
Where's my "yes"? Yes!

71
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,779
I'll race you!

72
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,219
- Are you guys excited?
- Yes!

73
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,379
- I'm so excited!
- Come on, Sadie!

74
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,019
I get my own room!

75
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,859
Are you kidding me?
No dibs on the rooms!

76
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,179
- What?
- What?

77
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,166
So do I get to pick my own room?
Or do I have no choice in that either?

78
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,859
Well, first cute boy she meets,
she'll forget about Jersey.

79
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,299
- Great.
- I hope.

80
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,806
I can't wait.

81
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,680
Come on, Sadie.

82
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,205
Sadie, let's go.

83
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,804
Hey, come.

84
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,379
What's the matter with you?

85
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,444
Hey, come on, girl.

86
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,209
All right, suit yourself.

87
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,299
- What's your name?
- What's your name?

88
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,339
- Who's your daddy?
- Who's your daddy?

89
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,139
- He rich?
- Is he rich like me?

90
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,419
Watch your step.

91
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,165
Coming through.

92
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,899
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

93
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,899
- Where do you want it?
- In the living room.

94
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,019
- Andrea, where's my wind chime?
- I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

95
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,419
Thanks. Hey, Nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?

96
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,219
- Oh, this one?
- Yeah, thanks.

97
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,364
- You're gonna have to catch it.
- Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

98
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,410
You're so mean.

99
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,019
Hey, Mom, can I hang up
my wind chime?

100
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,619
Of course. There's a line outside
you can hang it on.

101
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,419
Honey, have April come in, okay?
It's gonna be dark soon.

102
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,006
Okay.

103
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,209
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

104
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,047
Look what I found, Cindy.

105
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,045
One...

106
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,459
two...

107
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,739
three.

108
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,779
Come on, come on, come on.
No peeking.

109
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,339
Four.

110
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,619
Are you guys done with the pizza?
I don't want it going to waste.

111
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,219
- Let's go.
- It's expensive feeding you girls.

112
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,779
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

113
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,241
Where should I hide?

114
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,602
Ready or not, here I come!

115
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,360
Okay, clap.

116
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,779
- Whoa!
- You don't know the house well enough.

117
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,019
Someone's gonna get hurt.

118
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,606
I'm okay, I'm okay.

119
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,891
Second clap.

120
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,411
That's cheating.

121
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,286
Clap.

122
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,205
Got You!

123
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,848
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,739
All right, what did we break now?

125
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,979
- I didn't mean to.
- Move out of there, please.

126
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,819
It was Christine's fault.

127
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,219
- Oh, jeez.
- My fault? Oh, my God.

128
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,299
- Christine did it.
- No, I didn't.

129
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,619
- You pushed me.
- No, no, you fell back.

130
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,605
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?

131
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,499
What's going on?

132
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,699
- Nancy broke something.
- Shut up.

133
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,699
- What broke?
- It's the wall.

134
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,049
- Whoa.
- I think we have a cellar or something.

135
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,611
I wanna see, I wanna see. Move, move, move.

136
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,886
Here, matches. Thank you.

137
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,939
- I wanna see.
- You can see.

138
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,859
- I wanna see.
- You can all see.

139
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,366
Move!

140
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,403
Oh, man.

141
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,207
Huh.

142
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,240
Roger?

143
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,686
What do you see down there?

144
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,370
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

145
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,486
It's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.

146
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,047
Son of a--

147
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,284
Wow.

148
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,565
Rog?

149
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,331
Come on up.

150
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,139
I don't want you girls going down there.

151
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,059
That place is loaded with spiders.

152
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,259
Just relax. Okay.

153
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,881
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

154
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,659
We've got extra square footage anyway.
I'll check it out in the morning.

155
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,979
- I wonder why it was boarded up.
- I don't know.

156
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,179
Okay, show's over.

157
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,059
- Five minutes.
- No more minutes.

158
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,727
- Up to bed. Please. Thank you.
- Right to bed.

159
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,251
Man, I'm fried.

160
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,804
Something's up with Sadie.

161
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,921
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.
Couldn't get her to come inside.

162
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,739
We can't leave her out there.

163
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,202
She's all right. I got her on a chain.

164
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,290
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

165
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,139
Thanks for making this work.

166
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,329
I know it was a lot to bite off.

167
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,640
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

168
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,083
I think it's great already.

169
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,441
Yeah.

170
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,324
You still too fried to Christen
the new house?

171
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,770
Who said I'm fried?

172
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,324
- Ain't nobody here's fried.
- Ha, ha.

173
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,920
Mom?

174
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,419
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

175
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,739
I'm cold.

176
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,565
It is chilly, isn't it?

177
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,419
You think maybe we could have bought
a house with a toilet that actually works?

178
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,619
Tell your father.

179
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,899
And there was a funky smell in my room
last night. Like something died.

180
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,659
- Is it still there?
- No.

181
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,007
Problem solved.

182
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,881
Roger?

183
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,851
Roger?

184
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,765
Down here, honey.

185
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,967
Morning.

186
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,099
Ooh. Whoa.

187
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,939
This is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.

188
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,401
Yeah.

189
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,204
Oh, my God.

190
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,819
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

191
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,419
Well, we probably ought
to go through it, you know?

192
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,979
There might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.

193
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,965
Yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.

194
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,448
- It's ours now.
- Knock yourself out.

195
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,939
- I'm gonna make some coffee.
- Okay.

196
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,139
I'm gonna see if I can get
this furnace working.

197
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,099
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

198
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,561
Yeah.

199
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,204
Hmm.

200
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,365
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

201
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,966
Mommy!

202
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,459
Mommy, where's Sadie?

203
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,636
She's outside. You know, I'm sure
she's hungry by now.

204
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:17,108
Why don't you go and get her.

205
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,979
- Whoa.
- Morning, Dad.

206
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,139
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

207
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,979
- Sadie!
- Slow it down, Scoot.

208
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,459
- Roger.
- Yeah.

209
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,739
This clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.

210
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,451
That's weird.

211
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,979
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

212
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,019
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

213
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,939
- Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
- I don't know.

214
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,686
Sadie!

215
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,539
April! April!

216
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,299
What's--? April! What's going on?

217
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,921
- What happened?
- Oh, my God!

218
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,731
Oh, Sadie.

219
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,888
We keep everything locked in here.

220
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,084
Feel free to look around.

221
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,124
Just don't touch anything.

222
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,090
Wow.

223
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,850
This is crazy.

224
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,619
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

225
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,779
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

226
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,004
or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.

227
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,179
Nothing's a toy.

228
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,164
Not even the toy monkey.

229
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,045
Don't touch it.

230
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,579
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you...

231
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,019
to have all these items
right in your home?

232
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,579
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

233
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,939
Well, the way I see it is:

234
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,739
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

235
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,699
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

236
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,979
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

237
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,169
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

238
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,490
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

239
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,525
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

240
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,805
Right this way.

241
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,406
Yeah.

242
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,499
- You said she's a conduit?
- That's right.

243
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,859
What does that mean?

244
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,859
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

245
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,979
So when you guys investigate
these hauntings...

246
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,379
how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

247
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,139
We have to take great precaution.

248
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,044
But what about your wife?

249
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,285
What about her?

250
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,059
Well, Father Gordon told me that...

251
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,850
Well, that was different.

252
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,059
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

253
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,044
Well, what's the difference?

254
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,086
Excuse me.

255
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,120
Honey, what are you doing?

256
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,619
Come here.

257
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,099
You know better. All right?

258
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,819
Georgiana?

259
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,259
- Come on. Did you touch anything?
- No.

260
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,891
All right, come on, honey.

261
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,139
- Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?
- Oh, sure.

262
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,779
You can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?

263
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,525
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.

264
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,459
- Go on.
- Okay, come on.

265
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,809
Let's see if I can find you
a little snack, okay? Come on.

266
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,979
Hey. What's going on in here?

267
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,619
- Daddy, look.
- You look very pretty.

268
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,139
All right, all done.
Go get dressed for dinner.

269
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,284
- I'm wearing it to dinner.
- No, you're not!

270
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,686
Here you go.

271
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,619
How'd it go?

272
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,899
Oh, I think he may write a positive article.

273
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,123
Ooh, a non-skeptic.

274
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,859
That's a pleasant change.

275
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,321
Yeah.

276
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,964
Stop blaming yourself.

277
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,365
No sugar.

278
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,005
Be right back.

279
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,768
Not funny, Nancy.

280
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,160
What?

281
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,819
Stop grabbing my foot.

282
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,248
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

283
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,525
Yeah, right.

284
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,208
And stop farting.

285
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,449
It really stinks.

286
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,362
Don't blame that on me. It's you.

287
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,619
Dad?

288
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,859
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

289
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,219
What's that sound?

290
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,445
It's Cindy. She's in my room.
She's sleepwalking again.

291
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,008
I've never seen her do this before.

292
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,419
I remembered you saying not to wake her
if she's like this.

293
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,499
No, we just put her back to bed.

294
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,326
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

295
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,486
Let's go back to bed.

296
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,139
She's okay. Good night.

297
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,646
Night.

298
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,769
She's sleepwalking again?
She hasn't done that for awhile.

299
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,379
She ended up in Andrea's room too.
I think kind of freaked her out.

300
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,139
- That's not good. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

301
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,979
- Honey, you got another bruise here.
- Hmm?

302
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,611
Does that hurt?

303
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,579
That's weird.

304
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,804
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?

305
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,779
- Yeah, I will. Drive safe.
- Yeah.

306
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,809
- I love you.
- I love you too.

307
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,259
Bye!

308
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,050
Love you!

309
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,090
- Cindy, you have your lunch?
- Yeah.

310
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,579
Yes, I do.

311
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,723
I miss Sadie a lot.

312
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,247
She was my best friend.

313
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,329
You're my friend, right?

314
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,570
Yeah, let's play.

315
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,445
- Who are you talking to?
- Rory.

316
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,001
Rory?

317
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,259
- He's my new friend.
- Oh, really?

318
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,499
- Yeah, do you want to see him?
- Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

319
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,099
With this.

320
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,086
When the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.

321
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,979
Okay.

322
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,059
But you have to twist the key.

323
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,566
Okay.

324
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,730
- Boo, Mommy! Ha-ha!
- Oh!

325
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,210
- April, you just gave me a heart attack.
- Got you!

326
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,099
Well, okay, I guess Rory
doesn't want to see me, huh?

327
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,579
Hmm. Oh, well.

328
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,339
Can we play hide-and-clap?

329
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,779
Hide-and-cla...?
Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

330
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,687
- Please! Nobody ever lets me play.
- Okay, okay.

331
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,499
Remember, you get to ask me
for three claps.

332
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,699
Okay.

333
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,059
One, two, three.

334
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,859
- I'm gonna go hide now!
- Okay.

335
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,699
Four, five...

336
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,739
six, seven...

337
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,407
eight, nine...

338
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,286
...ten!

339
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,485
First clap!

340
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,659
Ow. Shit.

341
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,485
Second clap!

342
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,367
April.

343
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,765
April.

344
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,899
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

345
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,282
Give me the third clap.

346
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,285
I'm gonna get you now.

347
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,369
I can hear you breathing.

348
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,371
April.

349
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,771
April.

350
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,659
Ha, ha. You took your
blindfold off. I win!

351
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,806
You weren't even warm, Mom.
I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

352
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,126
I gotta have some routes here,
or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.

353
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,811
That's like half of my rate, man.

354
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,482
Yeah, okay.

355
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,419
I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll take it.

356
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,006
Thank you.

357
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,539
- What's the route?
- It's, uh, Florida.

358
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,571
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

359
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,885
We'll get through this.

360
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,779
Yeah.

361
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,411
Come on, let's go to bed.

362
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,179
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

363
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,563
I'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.

364
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,365
Nancy?

365
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,930
Nancy?

366
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,049
What are you doing?

367
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,971
Christine?

368
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,761
Are you all right?

369
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,091
Do you see it?

370
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,086
See what?

371
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,499
There's someone behind the door.

372
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,040
What?

373
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,251
There's someone standing over there.

374
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,727
I don't see anyone.

375
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,481
It's looking right at us.

376
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,099
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

377
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,699
No, no. Look. Look.

378
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,482
Look, there's no one here. See?

379
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,125
It's that smell again.

380
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,602
Oh, my God.

381
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,244
It's standing right behind you.

382
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,249
Christine? Christine! Christine!

383
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,770
God, it won't op...

384
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,939
- Christine!
- No! No! No!

385
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,099
- What's going on? What happened?
- There was someone else in here!

386
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,299
- What?
- Where?

387
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,779
By the door. It was behind the door.

388
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,459
Honey, there's nothing in here.
There's nobody in here.

389
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,419
There was someone else in here!

390
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:23,019
I was just sleeping, and then
I felt somebody grab my feet.

391
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,539
So I thought it was Nancy.

392
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,979
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.

393
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,859
No! It talked to me!

394
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,969
It said...

395
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,201
...that it wants my family dead.

396
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,720
Mr. Winston!

397
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,884
Winston? Winston?

398
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,651
Get behind him.

399
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,339
Where you off to?

400
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,120
I just gotta run to the store
for a few things.

401
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,139
- Why do you even try?
- What? What do you mean?

402
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,011
In 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?

403
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,979
Father Gordon called. He's got
a case he wants us to look into.

404
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,699
I said I'd go check it out myself.
Lorraine, myself.

405
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,365
I'm going with you.

406
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,459
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.

407
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,569
Yeah, I am. I really am.

408
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,251
Maybe it's just time we take a break.
Write that book.

409
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,285
Do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?

410
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,290
"Can we do it again?"

411
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,321
After that.

412
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,499
You said that God brought us together
for a reason. Right?

413
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,690
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

414
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,044
I'm gonna get dressed.

415
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,539
We've isolated the disturbances
to the attic.

416
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,201
I want you to listen for a second.

417
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,601
Oh, my God, that's it.

418
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,685
Do it again, Ed.

419
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,739
Right now it's just my weight. But you
take the water coming off the pipe

420
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,459
...combined with the wind coming
through the broken window...

421
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,979
these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.

422
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,131
You heard it all through
the house because of

423
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:14,939
these pipes leading to the radiator.

424
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,019
So this place isn't haunted?

425
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,819
No, it rarely is.

426
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,886
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

427
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,771
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

428
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,370
Who is that?

429
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,331
Who's ever down there,
I'm gonna lock you in now!

430
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,619
Help!

431
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,729
Andrea! Help!

432
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,846
Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?

433
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,720
Cindy?

434
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,363
Okay, now...

435
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,840
All right?

436
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,605
All right, come on.

437
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,200
Come on.

438
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,446
There you go.

439
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,408
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?

440
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,645
There you go.

441
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,201
There.

442
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,286
- Andrea?
- Help! Help! Help!

443
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,939
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

444
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,299
Andrea? Andrea!

445
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,619
In here!

446
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,219
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

447
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,965
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

448
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,930
What happened?

449
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,526
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?

450
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:22,459
Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation
and anxiety caused by the presence...

451
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,179
or imminence of danger.

452
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,819
Whether it's a ghost, a spirit or
an entity, they all feed on it.

453
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,059
Take Maurice here.

454
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,379
A French-Canadian farmer with
no more than a third-grade education...

455
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,059
yet after he was possessed, spoke
some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

456
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,459
Sometimes backwards.

457
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,481
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

458
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,979
A dark spirit made its home
in this man.

459
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,729
Now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.

460
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,579
And like that...

461
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:04,044
an upside-down cross started
to appear from within his body.

462
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,002
All right, Drew, you can hit the lights.

463
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,379
Oh.

464
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,939
Did you personally perform the exorcism?

465
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,939
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

466
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,019
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous...

467
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,369
not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

468
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,419
- What happened to Maurice?
- He tried to kill his wife...

469
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,819
but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

470
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:31,419
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

471
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,610
and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

472
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,059
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

473
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,459
Infestation, oppression and possession.

474
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,979
Now, infestation:

475
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:46,139
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

476
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,939
which ultimately grows into oppression,
the second stage.

477
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,379
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

478
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,419
who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

479
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,459
is targeted specifically
by an external force.

480
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,099
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

481
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,856
And, once in a weakened state,

482
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:06,636
leads them to the third and
final stage: possession.

483
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,179
- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
- Yeah.

484
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,779
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

485
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,979
- Hi.
- Thanks, Drew.

486
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,619
I'll see you later.

487
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,859
How can we help you?

488
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,403
There's something horrible
happening in my house.

489
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:22,459
Could you come and take a look?

490
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,459
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

491
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,379
- We really need to head to our family.
- You don't understand.

492
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,419
But we do. There's usually
some sort of rational explanation--

493
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,989
I have five daughters who
are scared to death.

494
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:35,339
I'm so afraid this thing
wants to hurt us.

495
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,290
You have a daughter.

496
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:39,339
Wouldn't you do anything you could
to protect her? Please.

497
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,847
Please can you come and take a look?

498
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,566
Of course we will.

499
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,930
Of course we will.

500
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,002
Come on, Jan! Open up!

501
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,891
Jan, what happened?

502
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,699
The top of your head turned black.

503
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,619
You guys straighten up? Thanks.

504
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,729
Don't be silly, it's a wig.

505
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,859
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

506
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,571
Thanks for coming.

507
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,939
- Hi, I'm Roger.
- Lorraine.

508
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,527
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

509
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,859
- Thanks for coming.
- Please, come in.

510
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,366
Thank you.

511
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,859
So...

512
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,019
Oh, my God. Look at you all.
Who are these beautiful young women?

513
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,579
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

514
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,450
and April.

515
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,605
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

516
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,885
- We're all sleeping down here now.
- Mm.

517
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,085
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

518
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,819
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.

519
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,899
It's not a problem with the furnace.

520
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,486
I mean, not that I can find.

521
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,486
It's gotten a lot worse
the past few nights.

522
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:09,370
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.
It moves around the house.

523
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,259
Uh...

524
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,766
What? What is it?

525
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:20,779
Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.

526
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,161
Oh, my God.

527
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,739
That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.

528
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,487
Otherwise, it's like:
All night long, just like that.

529
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,819
- Does it come in threes?
- Yeah.

530
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,281
It stops at dawn?

531
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,086
Uh-huh.

532
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,219
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity:

533
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,488
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

534
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,699
You know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds...

535
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,819
that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.

536
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,659
Hm. Really?

537
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,219
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

538
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,602
- All of them?
- Every one.

539
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,619
Oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.

540
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,105
Something just kept
knocking them down,

541
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,633
so we stopped hanging them up.

542
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,927
That's what I was talking about.

543
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,859
It was here when we moved in.

544
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,367
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

545
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,771
Show me the cellar.

546
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,419
<i>Look what she made me do.</i>

547
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,121
You picking up anything in here, hon?

548
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,605
Something awful happened here, Ed.

549
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,499
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?

550
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,850
Oh, it's some iron deficiency
thing I have.

551
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,401
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?

552
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,539
I don't know where we'd
move to, you know?

553
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:14,164
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

554
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,699
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.

555
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,889
That's why we tracked you down.

556
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,124
We're glad you found us.

557
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,921
All right, let's get started.

558
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,379
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

559
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,539
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

560
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:38,050
who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

561
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,450
Okay, go ahead.

562
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,371
Where do I start?

563
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,604
From the first occurrence.

564
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,539
I guess it was the clocks.

565
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,659
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

566
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,059
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

567
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,059
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.

568
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,259
Why is that?

569
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,360
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

570
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,321
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

571
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,481
Hey.

572
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,526
What is it?

573
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,810
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

574
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:24,691
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

575
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,166
An exorcism.

576
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,205
What, exorcism?

577
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,019
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

578
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,685
No, not necessarily, no.

579
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,499
We have to get out of here.

580
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,802
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

581
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,979
Lorraine saw something, which--

582
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,566
Go ahead, hon.

583
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,219
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

584
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,045
<i>...and your land.</i>

585
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,939
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

586
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,447
<i>It was latched to your back.</i>

587
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,010
<i>And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.</i>

588
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,099
And it doesn't matter where you go...

589
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,379
this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

590
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,205
...and it's feeding off you.

591
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,259
Even if we leave?

592
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,245
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

593
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,689
You take it with you.

594
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,699
Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here...

595
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,408
but this is the one that I'm most worried
about, because it is so hateful.

596
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,179
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

597
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,659
I wish it were that easy.

598
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,156
Performing an exorcism
is an archaic procedure.

599
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,389
Requires years of training.

600
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,890
And even then, I have seen it
go horribly wrong.

601
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:57,419
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

602
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,859
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

603
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,650
and that's the hard part.

604
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,379
Have your children been baptized?

605
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,939
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

606
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,699
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

607
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,979
Why?

608
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,539
Because we're a threat.

609
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,579
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

610
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,339
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

611
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,379
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

612
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,489
to see what we're up against.

613
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,379
Judy, what are you up to?

614
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,299
- I got you a present.
- Aah.

615
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,539
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.

616
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,539
- Honey.
- One for you and one for me.

617
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,259
- Aw.
- She put a picture...

618
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,846
of you and Daddy in mine.

619
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,379
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.

620
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,206
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

621
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,008
I miss you and Daddy.

622
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,766
Hey, hon.

623
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,899
Yup.

624
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,044
You're not gonna believe this.
Carolyn's voice didn't record.

625
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,447
What do you mean?

626
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,606
Listen.

627
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,419
<i>My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.</i>

628
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,419
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...</i>

629
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,167
<i>who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

630
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,885
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

631
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,929
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

632
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,806
Nothing.

633
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,459
The whole time.

634
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,286
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

635
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,859
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

636
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,939
That's the original farmhouse.

637
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,259
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

638
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,086
who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

639
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,379
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

640
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,699
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

641
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,779
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

642
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,859
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

643
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,859
and when the baby was 7 days old...

644
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,899
Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

645
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,139
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

646
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,459
climbed up,
proclaimed her love to Satan...

647
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,651
cursed anyone who tried to take
her land, and hung herself.

648
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,087
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

649
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,059
Well, that explains a few things.

650
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,089
Yeah, so does this.

651
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,299
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

652
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,499
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

653
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,609
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

654
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,687
And that's not all.

655
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:47,939
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

656
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,323
There was another boy who
drowned in a pond here.

657
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:52,059
He lived in a house over here.

658
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,088
And a woman who worked as a
maid in a neighboring home,

659
00:56:55,113 --> 00:56:57,314
she committed suicide too.

660
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,243
People who took her land.

661
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,979
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...</i>

662
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,489
<i>...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

663
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,411
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

664
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,688
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

665
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,360
Here's Brad.

666
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,619
- You find it okay?
- Oh, yeah.

667
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,179
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

668
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,859
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

669
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:04,049
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

670
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,939
- So you're the lucky new cop, huh?
- Guess so.

671
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,219
- You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?
- Take it easy on him, Drew.

672
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,761
All right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.

673
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,405
You take this.

674
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,721
Hi, Roger.

675
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:28,099
All right. When you're finished here, why
don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

676
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,606
You got it.

677
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,010
What's wrong with the Chevy?

678
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,459
What's not wrong with her?

679
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,819
- Needs a new carburetor to start.
- Oh, yeah?

680
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,059
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.

681
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,805
Yeah.

682
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,842
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?

683
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,481
What's this, uh, do?

684
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,659
When there's an instant drop
in temperature...

685
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,406
the thermostat triggers the camera
to take a picture.

686
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,888
You've actually caught things on film?

687
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,851
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

688
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,459
Why, uh--? Why out here?

689
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,491
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.

690
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:34,284
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.

691
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,680
How could a mother kill her own child?

692
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,099
It was never a child to her.

693
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,899
She just used her God-given gift
as the ultimate offense against him.

694
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,283
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.

695
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,699
Wow.
That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

696
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,699
How did you know?

697
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,528
It's an insight. It's like a peek through
the curtain into another person's life.

698
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,619
That day meant so much to me.
We were driving along the coast.

699
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,526
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.

700
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,899
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.

701
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,219
We're gonna start fresh, you know?
A new house, a new beginning.

702
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,739
You should have seen Roger and the girls.
I've never seen them so happy.

703
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,201
Cheese!

704
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,968
They mean the world to me.

705
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,403
Put your hand flat on the desk.

706
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,769
Yeah, and take it off.

707
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,725
Here we go.

708
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,059
See?

709
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,619
It just reveals to us
what the naked eye can't see.

710
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,410
Pretty far out, isn't it?

711
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,009
Yeah, it's groovy.

712
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,779
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

713
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,401
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

714
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,446
What? I had to go.

715
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,979
All the rooms are coming in pretty good.

716
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,520
Good.

717
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,485
What's in the bottle?

718
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,327
Holy water.

719
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,739
Presence of religious icons...

720
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:26,089
will get a reaction
from anything unholy.

721
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,529
Sort of pisses them off.

722
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,322
So I set these throughout the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.

723
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,000
- Like holding a cross to a vampire?
- Yeah. Exactly.

724
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:43,522
Except I don't believe in vampires.

725
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,840
Wasn't me.

726
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,850
Brad, get the camera.

727
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,761
Okay.

728
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,104
All right, it's 9:18, we're
headed down into the cellar

729
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,419
where the door's just
opened on its own.

730
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,459
I have Lorraine and Officer
Brad Hamilton with me.

731
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,888
Let's keep the cellar light off.

732
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,724
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.

733
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,765
Hon, you all right?

734
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,566
There's definitely something here.

735
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:25,089
- All right, close the door. Move something.
- My hands are so cold.

736
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,646
Come on.

737
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,819
No.

738
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,659
It's gone. It's gone.

739
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,450
I got nothing.

740
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,091
Okay.

741
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:04,127
Well, like I said, it doesn't always work
when you want it to.

742
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:07,086
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

743
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,166
Watch out!

744
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,339
For a guy who doesn't believe...

745
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:18,008
you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.

746
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,928
It must have been a draft.

747
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,129
Oh, that's funny.

748
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:28,246
A draft never put that look
on my face before.

749
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,684
I believe the clock.

750
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,924
It's 3:08.

751
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,690
Let me see your glasses.

752
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,939
For you.

753
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:51,553
I think I might take some
girls for ice cream later on.

754
01:05:51,578 --> 01:05:52,859
What do you say about that?

755
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,179
- Yeah!
- Honey, you wanna come?

756
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,379
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.

757
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,979
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.

758
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,739
- Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
- Really?

759
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,619
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.

760
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,979
The house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.

761
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,204
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.

762
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,206
- I could get used to this.
- What, me doing laundry?

763
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,163
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're funny.

764
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,325
No, this place.

765
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,802
Nice, fresh country air.

766
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,019
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

767
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:37,803
Yeah, that little one, April,
did you see her bring me pancakes?

768
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,844
We've gotta help them.

769
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,731
I know.

770
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,400
- I'll start with the Chevy.
- Heh.

771
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,846
Carolyn!

772
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,779
Are you okay?

773
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,099
Carolyn, open the door.

774
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,481
Carolyn, open up!

775
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,379
Are you okay?

776
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,819
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Are you sick?

777
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,819
- I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.
- I thought I saw...

778
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:33,219
I hear Roger and the girls.

779
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:34,601
One minute.

780
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,819
- Guys, do you wanna play a game?
- Boring!

781
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,246
Thank you, Daddy.

782
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,681
Let's go inside.

783
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,019
I thought that was you.

784
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,419
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

785
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,259
I got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

786
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,559
No, you look like you
know what you're doing.

787
01:09:04,584 --> 01:09:05,633
Yeah, we'll see.

788
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,099
Got a nice place here, Roger.

789
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,579
Lorraine and I always wanted
a spot in the country.

790
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,211
I'll sell you this one.

791
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,925
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

792
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:24,859
Hey, uh, it really means a lot
to us to have you here.

793
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:28,243
I gotta admit, I was
a little bit skeptical going in.

794
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:32,603
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.

795
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,859
I can't take the credit.
That's, uh-- That's all Lorraine.

796
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,925
- I didn't want to.
- Oh. Why's that?

797
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,499
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.

798
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,859
But it also takes a toll on her.

799
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,525
Little piece each time.

800
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,211
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.

801
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,489
She saw something.

802
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,525
It took a real big piece.

803
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,859
When we got home...

804
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,019
she went into our room,
locked herself in...

805
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:23,164
...didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.

806
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,451
What'd she see?

807
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,640
Get out of here!

808
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,960
I don't know.

809
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,130
And I won't ask.

810
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:54,883
I need to reload. You want some?

811
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,885
I'm good, thanks.

812
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,006
All right.

813
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,563
Look what she made me do.

814
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,561
Look what she made me do.

815
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,606
Hey.

816
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:43,979
Ed?

817
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,486
Look what she made me do!

818
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,284
Ed! Ed!

819
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,160
Ed!

820
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,339
Dude, you okay?

821
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,979
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

822
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:55,948
I saw someone.

823
01:12:55,973 --> 01:12:58,328
There was a woman
dressed as a maid.

824
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,848
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

825
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,527
It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.

826
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:11,819
No, wait. We need this.

827
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,690
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

828
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,019
She didn't trigger it.

829
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,249
What do you mean she
didn't trigger it?

830
01:13:18,274 --> 01:13:19,666
Somebody's with her.

831
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,961
Who?

832
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,245
Cindy!

833
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,246
Cindy!

834
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,259
Cindy!

835
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,059
Hey, over here. It's safe.

836
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,249
There's someone else in there with her.

837
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,841
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

838
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,847
Follow me. This way.

839
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:00,129
This is where I hide.

840
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,520
Cindy?

841
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,371
Cindy?

842
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,361
Where'd she go, Ed?

843
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,364
Windows are locked.

844
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,368
Ed, where'd she go?

845
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,099
Brad, get the UV light.

846
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:23,864
The what?

847
01:14:23,889 --> 01:14:25,386
Just ask Drew.

848
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,409
Drew, I need a UV light.

849
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,165
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

850
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,245
Turn off the light.

851
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,450
Get out of the way.

852
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,726
Okay.

853
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,525
Hit the lights!

854
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,090
Found her.

855
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:35,767
Here we go.

856
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,779
All right. You got her?

857
01:15:37,804 --> 01:15:38,625
Yeah.

858
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,369
That's where Rory hides
when he's afraid.

859
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:22,084
Hon? Could I have April's
music box, please?

860
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,891
- How's Cindy?
- She doesn't remember a thing.

861
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,171
Here you go.

862
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,206
Thank you.

863
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,205
Lorraine!

864
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,520
No.

865
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,579
Lorraine!

866
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:34,120
Lorraine!

867
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,891
Lorraine!

868
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,091
Lorraine!

869
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,971
She made me do it.

870
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,611
She made me do it.

871
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:03,931
She made me do it.

872
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,579
Ed!

873
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,689
Come on! Lorraine!

874
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:59,646
Ed!

875
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:02,099
Ed, I know what she did.

876
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,819
- I got you. I know. It's okay.
- I know what she did.

877
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:07,899
I know what she did. She possessed
the mother to kill the child.

878
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,579
She visits Carolyn every night.

879
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:12,724
That's what the bruise marks are!
She's feeding off of her!

880
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,085
Nancy?

881
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,800
Nancy!

882
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,486
Are you okay?

883
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,411
Nancy!

884
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,967
Grab her!

885
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,050
Daddy! Help!

886
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:47,001
Nancy!

887
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,219
Is she okay?

888
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,579
It's okay, I got you.

889
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,927
Did you get that?

890
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,406
Yeah.

891
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,419
I'll have the footage developed
and get it over to Father Gordon.

892
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,116
He's our liaison at the church.

893
01:21:09,141 --> 01:21:11,579
I imagine we'll get a
pretty fast response.

894
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,834
Listen, Roger?

895
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:13,819
Yeah?

896
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:17,139
Listen, when we get the exorcist,
I'll be back. But Lorraine...

897
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,045
Yeah, I understand.

898
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:20,379
Until then Drew's gonna
keep an eye on you.

899
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,380
Hey, Ed, thank you
for everything.

900
01:21:22,405 --> 01:21:23,071
Yeah.

901
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,766
Mommy?

902
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,730
That's everything.

903
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,005
Mommy?

904
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,446
Judy?

905
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,979
Oh, God!

906
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,406
Judy?

907
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:16,003
Lorraine! Wait!

908
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,979
Lorraine. What?

909
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,499
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

910
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,295
What?

911
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,404
Can you go check, please?

912
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,379
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

913
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:27,546
Are you gonna tell
me what's going on?

914
01:22:27,571 --> 01:22:28,379
It's Judy.

915
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,205
What? What do you mean?

916
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,326
What?

917
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:35,842
Oh, thank God.

918
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,386
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

919
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:39,713
I'll explain later, okay?

920
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,499
What the hell happened?

921
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,139
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

922
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,727
I know it was some kind of warning.

923
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:51,299
I know it.

924
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,840
Okay.

925
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:56,211
Let's get out of here.

926
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,539
- So?
- Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

927
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,921
No.

928
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:52,739
Look, Ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.

929
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:53,590
No, I understand.

930
01:23:53,615 --> 01:23:56,139
And the family are not
members of the church.

931
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,771
- Oh, come on.
- And...

932
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:02,082
The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.

933
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:06,364
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

934
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:12,971
Yeah, well, neither have I.

935
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,569
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

936
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,400
All right.

937
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:28,339
I'll push it through myself.

938
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:30,608
- Thank you, Father. Thank you.
- Thank you.

939
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:33,278
All right, we'll
wait for your call.

940
01:24:33,303 --> 01:24:34,108
Yeah.

941
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:40,042
Mommy? Daddy?

942
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,891
Mommy?

943
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,731
Daddy?

944
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,925
Dad?

945
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,685
Nanna?

946
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:46,331
Nanna?

947
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,606
Aah!

948
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:42,059
Nanna!

949
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:45,019
Nanna, help! Nanna, help!

950
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,219
Judy?

951
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:50,889
Nanna!

952
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,646
Help!

953
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,579
- Judy!
- Nanna!

954
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,689
- Judy, open the door!
- Mom!

955
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,682
- Ed, there's something wrong.
- What?

956
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:04,961
Nanna!

957
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,059
- Judy!
- Help!

958
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:09,379
- Judy! Judy, open this door!
- What is it?

959
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,747
What's wrong with her? Judy!

960
01:28:10,772 --> 01:28:12,699
Hey, move. Move,
move, move, move.

961
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,604
Judy, get back, honey. Get back!

962
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:16,485
- Come on!
- Hurry.

963
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:19,123
Help! Help!

964
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,410
Get away from the door, Judy!

965
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,139
Aah!

966
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:27,979
Oh, God! Are you okay?

967
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:32,365
There was someone rocking in the chair
with Annabelle.

968
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,566
What?

969
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,040
It's okay.

970
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,405
She's still in the case.

971
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,247
It's okay.

972
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:09,090
It's okay. It's okay.

973
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,859
- Dad! Dad!
- Daddy!

974
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:19,379
Dad! Dad! Mom just left
with Christine and April.

975
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:22,019
She went in the car and drove away.
I don't know what happened.

976
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,263
She smells like rotting meat.

977
01:29:23,288 --> 01:29:24,699
She didn't say what was going on.

978
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,560
What do you mean, she left?
Left where?

979
01:29:26,585 --> 01:29:28,631
Gone! I don't know
where she was going.

980
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,689
Where are we going, Mom?

981
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,459
- Hello?
- It's Roger.

982
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:46,979
Something's going on with Carolyn.

983
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,979
Andrea was here, said Carolyn took off
with Christine and April.

984
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,779
The girls said she
smelled like rotten meat.

985
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:52,899
Possesses the mother...

986
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:55,819
to kill the child, that's what she does.
She's taking them to the house.

987
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:57,819
Roger, get back to the house now.
I'll meet you.

988
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:01,567
Lock the door, close the blinds.
Stay off the phone!

989
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:03,226
Go.

990
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:10,939
- I'm coming.
- No, you stay with Judy.

991
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,499
Only way to protect Judy is if
we stop this where it started.

992
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,249
Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.

993
01:30:15,274 --> 01:30:16,819
That's exactly why I am going.

994
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:19,726
You think I'm gonna let you walk
into this alone?

995
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,731
I can't lose you.

996
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,560
You won't.

997
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:26,404
Let's finish this together.

998
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,018
It's locked.

999
01:30:46,343 --> 01:30:47,449
Carolyn!

1000
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,379
Roger!

1001
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,806
Get out of the way!

1002
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,460
Roger!

1003
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:58,239
Ed!

1004
01:30:58,540 --> 01:30:59,436
Carolyn!

1005
01:30:59,461 --> 01:31:00,468
Ed!

1006
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:02,739
- Carolyn!
- We're down here!

1007
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,739
Carolyn, don't!
No, no! She's got...!

1008
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,168
Get her hand! Get the scissors!

1009
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,427
We gotta get her to the car!

1010
01:31:20,452 --> 01:31:21,659
And bring her where?

1011
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:23,819
To take her to the priest
for the exorcism.

1012
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:25,485
- Where's April?
- April?

1013
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,126
April!

1014
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,899
Take Christine to the car
and find April!

1015
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,247
April!

1016
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,686
Come on!

1017
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,939
- She won't let her leave the house.
- What do you mean?

1018
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,641
If we take her out,
the witch will kill her.

1019
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:57,659
Roger!

1020
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:00,625
Carolyn!

1021
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:02,379
Go!

1022
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,861
Carolyn?

1023
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:11,619
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.
Come on.

1024
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,419
- Get in. Stay in here.
- I don't wanna stay here by myself.

1025
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,379
Stay in here no matter what.
I'll be back.

1026
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:19,126
I have to find April, okay?
I'll be back, I promise.

1027
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,541
April?

1028
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,040
You okay?

1029
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,100
Stop!

1030
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,562
Brad! Brad!

1031
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:54,803
Let's get something to tie her up!

1032
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:03,565
Hold it.

1033
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:17,099
I gotta call Father Gordon.
We gotta get him out here.

1034
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,767
He's too far away.
She won't make it. Look at her.

1035
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,846
- Then you need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

1036
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:35,128
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1037
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:38,419
What? I thought you said we
need a priest. You're not a priest.

1038
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:41,166
- Well, you got a better idea?
- He can do it.

1039
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:44,299
- You can do it.
- But you gotta get out of here.

1040
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:45,401
I'm not leaving you!

1041
01:33:45,426 --> 01:33:48,231
Damn it, I'm not doing this
with you in here!

1042
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:53,283
God brought us together for a reason.
This is it.

1043
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,790
I'm gonna get the book.

1044
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,445
April!

1045
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:23,685
April!

1046
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:49,441
"In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1047
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:30,281
April!

1048
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:32,139
Hold her still! Hold her still!

1049
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:34,204
Come here! Hold her still!

1050
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,880
April?

1051
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:51,959
April!

1052
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,730
April, you under there?

1053
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:56,301
April!

1054
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:04,939
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!
Don't let her take you!

1055
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:07,139
Ed! You gotta stop,
you're killing her. Stop!

1056
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:08,805
No, he can't!

1057
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:12,551
Roger, help me!

1058
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,319
Ed! Goddamn it, stop it!

1059
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:23,019
Understand this! We are now
fighting for her soul!

1060
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:26,459
"In the name of Jesus Christ,
the saints and all the angels..."

1061
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,842
"I command you to reveal yourself!"

1062
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,011
Roger, help me!

1063
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:52,951
Put her down!

1064
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,406
Put her down!

1065
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,881
Put her down!

1066
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:01,599
Carolyn!

1067
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,086
Carolyn!

1068
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:07,622
Ed, look out!

1069
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,985
Are you okay?

1070
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:17,099
Hold her still! Don't let her up!

1071
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,699
We're losing her, Roger!

1072
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:21,379
Damn you! You leave my family alone,
you hear me?

1073
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:24,179
I don't know what you are, but you
leave my wife alone, goddamn it!

1074
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:27,384
Let her go! Do you hear me?
Let her go!

1075
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:32,181
Let her go, goddamn it! Let her go!

1076
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,602
She's already gone.

1077
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:43,448
And now you're all gonna die.

1078
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,059
April!

1079
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:55,851
I found her! She's under the house!
Under the kitchen!

1080
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:58,641
Don't! No!

1081
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:00,711
Get her!

1082
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:15,759
Here.

1083
01:40:15,784 --> 01:40:16,969
Carolyn!

1084
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,728
- Carolyn!
- She's in that hole. Right there.

1085
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:26,299
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!

1086
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:29,131
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1087
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:30,900
No! Carolyn, don't!

1088
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:34,599
Carolyn, no!

1089
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:36,489
Bathsheba!

1090
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:42,790
By the power of God,
I condemn you back to hell!

1091
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:47,250
This is your daughter!

1092
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:51,239
You can't give in!

1093
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:54,339
Roger. We need to get her
to fight from the inside.

1094
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:57,059
Don't let her do this.
Don't let this thing do this.

1095
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:59,459
You gotta fight it.
You're stronger than she is.

1096
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,499
- You gotta fight!
- Keep it going, Roger!

1097
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,565
You gotta stay with us, all right?
Come on back, Carolyn.

1098
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:06,459
You're in, that's it! Get her back!

1099
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:09,411
- Remember what you showed me.
- No!

1100
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:13,800
Remember that day that you said
you would never forget.

1101
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,887
You said they meant the world to you.

1102
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:28,347
This is what you'll be leaving behind.

1103
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:08,606
Mommy?

1104
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,230
It's over.

1105
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,259
I am so sorry.

1106
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:49,359
I love you so much.
I love you so much.

1107
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,191
I love you so much.

1108
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,744
I'm so happy.

1109
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,829
A draft do that to your face?

1110
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:20,702
I'd take a guy with a gun any day.

1111
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,225
You did good.

1112
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:28,171
No, you did.

1113
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:32,129
I'll call Father Gordon
and let him know what happened.

1114
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,310
Sounds good.

1115
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:02,246
The Vatican approved the exorcism.

1116
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:04,562
Heh. Nice timing.

1117
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:09,799
And if we can, then he'd like
to meet with us tomorrow.

1118
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:12,579
There's a case in Long Island
he'd like to discuss.

1119
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:13,961
Really?
