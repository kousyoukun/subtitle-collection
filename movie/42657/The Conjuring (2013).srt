4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,512
一想起来就吓人
It scares us just thinking about it.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,751
你们会觉得我们疯了的
When you hear it, you're gonna think we're insane.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,600
说来听听，从头开始
Try us. Please, from the start.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,875
一开始没什么，只是手脚在不同位置而已
It started out small,like a hand or a leg was in a different position.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,555
然后它的脑袋变成了向上，而不是向下
Then its head was looking up instead of down.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,758
然后有一天，它突然出现在另一个房间
And then one day, it was in a completely different room.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,479
它会自己挪地方
It was moving around by itself.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,793
是不是有人有你公寓的钥匙，跟你恶作剧？
Ever think maybe somebody had a key to your apartment and was playing a trick on you?

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,633
我们也这么想过
That's exactly what we thought.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,542
但没有发现任何有人进来过的痕迹
But never once did we find any sign or evidence of intrusion.
(安娜贝尔事件 - 1968年)

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,037
所以你们认为这个娃娃是被附身了？
And this all led you to believe that the doll was possessed?

15
00:00:59,154 --> 00:00:59,729
是的
Yes.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,150
卡米拉联系过一位灵媒，她说有个名叫安娜贝尔·希金斯…
Camilla got in touch with a medium.We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,233
…的7岁小女孩曾经死在这个公寓里
...named Annabelle Higgins had died in this apartment.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,110
她很孤独并且很喜欢我的娃娃
She was lonely and took a liking to my doll.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,632
她只想要交朋友
All she wanted was to be friends.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,156
我们知道这些后觉得她很可怜
When we heard this,we felt really sorry for her.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,000
我们是护士，帮助人是我们的职责
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,476
然后…
So...

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,115
…我们允许她进入了那个娃娃
...we gave her permission to move into the doll.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,272
等等，你们做了什么？
Wait, you did what?

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,070
她想附身在娃娃里跟我们一起生活
She wanted to live with us by inhabiting the doll.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,435
我们同意了
We said yes.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,990
然后情况越来越糟
But then things got worse.

28
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:41,443
(想我吗？)

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,360
上帝啊
God.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,352
我们回家的时候，她坐在走廊上
When we came home,she was sitting in the hallway.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,955
但我们走的时候是把她放在空房间里的
But we had left her in the spare room.

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,951
黛比！黛比，等我！
Debbie! Debbie, wait!

33
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,757
我们吓坏了
We are beyond terrified.

34
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,920
不知道怎么回事、该怎么做，可以帮帮我们吗？
We don't know what's going on or what to do. Can you help us?

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,514
可以
Yes, we can.

36
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,000
首先，安娜贝尔并不存在，从来没有
Now, firstly, there's no such thing as Annabelle, and there never was.

37
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,231
鬼魂没有如此强大的力量
Ghosts don't possess such power.

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,040
我认为我们面对的是某种非常有心计
I think what we have here is something extremely manipulative.

39
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,157
某种凶残的东西
It's something inhuman.

40
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,831
你们对这娃娃的认识是非常错误的
It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,151
这样看来，是这个恶灵算计了你们
And through that,the inhuman spirit tricked you.

42
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,080
你们给了它侵扰你们生命的许可
You gave it permission to infest your lives.

43
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,478
什么是恶灵？
What's an inhuman spirit?

44
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,517
某种从未以人类形态出现过的
It's something that's never walked the earth in human form.

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,798
邪恶的东西
It's something demonic.

46
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,757
所以娃娃并没有被附身？
So the doll was never possessed?

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,838
不，不，这只是它的载体
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,350
它自己挪动位置，让人觉得是被附身了
It was moved around to give the impression of possession.

49
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,196
恶灵不会附身于物品，它们只会附身于人类
Demonic spirits don't possess things,they possess people.

50
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,431
它想占有你们的身体
It wanted to get inside of you.

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,191
很好，德鲁，可以关掉了
All right, that's good, Drew.You can shut it down now.

52
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,030
开灯
Hit the lights.

53
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,157
所以我们让教堂派了一位牧师过去
So we got the church to send a priest over...

54
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,391
给那房子以及住客进行了一次赐福
...to perform a blessing on the house and the occupants.

55
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,236
困扰那公寓的东西已经没有了，还有什么问题吗？
Whatever was oppressing that apartment was no longer with them. Any questions?

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,396
你
Yes.

57
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,199
那娃娃现在在哪？
Where's the doll now?

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,113
某个安全的地方
Someplace safe.

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,551
你  - 你们什么人？
Yep.  - So, what are you guys?

60
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,558
我是说，别人怎么称呼你们？
I mean, what do people call you?

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,480
嗯，好吧，有人称呼我们为“神鬼学家”
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.That's one name for us.

62
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,353
“猎魔人”，“灵异研究者”
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

63
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,836
“怪人”
Kooks.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,434
“疯子”
Wackos.

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,753
但我们更想被叫做“艾德和罗琳·沃伦”
But we prefer to be known simply as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

66
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:49,588
1960年起，艾德和罗琳·沃伦被认为是世上最著名的灵异现象调查者

67
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:53,713
罗琳拥有阴阳眼，艾德是天主教会唯一认可的神鬼学家

68
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:56,484
他们饱受争议的事业中经历了无数事件

69
00:05:56,931 --> 00:06:00,255
唯有一件极度邪恶的事件，直到现在才为人所知

70
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,014
基于真实故事改编

71
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:14,972
《招魂》

72
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:34,552
1971年，哈瑞斯维尔，罗德岛

73
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,834
我们到了
Here we are.

74
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,437
哇噢，听到了吗？
Wow, hear that?

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,239
我什么都没听到  - 没错
I don't hear anything.  - Exactly.

76
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,629
好吧！
Oh. Okay!

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,077
好了，孩子们，我们到了！下车
Okay. Guys, we are here!Get out of the car.

78
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,118
上帝啊，我们在荒郊野外
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

79
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,318
你们激动吗？给我个肯定的回答，是的！
Are you so excited?Where's my "yes"? Where's my "yes"? Yes!

80
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,590
比谁跑得快
I'll race you!

81
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,991
你们激动吗？  - 是的！
Are you guys excited?  - Yes!

82
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,157
我很激动！  - 快来，赛迪！
I'm so excited!  - Come on, Sadie!

83
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,840
我自己选房间！
I get my own room!

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,674
你开玩笑吧？不准挑房间！
Are you kidding me?No dibs on the rooms!

85
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,956
什么？  - 什么？
What?  - What?

86
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,836
那我可以自己选房间吗？还是也一样没得选？
So do I get to pick my own room?Or do I have no choice in that either?

87
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,671
她遇到心仪的男孩就会忘了新泽西的
Well, first cute boy she meets,she'll forget about Jersey.

88
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,115
很好  - 但愿
Great.  - I hope.

89
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,475
我等不及了
I can't wait.

90
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,349
过来，赛迪
Come on, Sadie.

91
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,874
赛迪，走吧
Sadie, let's go.

92
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,473
过来啊
Hey, come.

93
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

94
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,113
来啊，小妞
Hey, come on, girl.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,878
好吧，随你
All right, suit yourself.

96
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,236
小心台阶
Watch your step.

97
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,834
借过
Coming through.

98
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,716
哇噢，小心，老爸
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

99
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,712
你想把它放在哪？  - 客厅
Where do you want it?  - In the living room.

100
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,793
安德莉亚，我的风铃在哪？  - 好像南希拿到另一个房间了
Andrea, where's my wind chime?  - I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,231
谢了！ 南希，看到我的风铃了吗？
Thanks! Hey, Nancy,have you seen my wind chime?

102
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,039
这个吗？  - 是的，谢谢
Oh, this one?  - Yeah, thanks.

103
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,034
自己来拿  - 南希！放手！给我
You're gonna have to catch it.  - Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

104
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,079
你太坏了
You're so mean.

105
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,833
妈妈，我可以挂风铃吗？
Hey, Mom, can I hang up my wind chime?

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,390
当然，外面有条绳子，你可以挂在那
Of course. There's a line outside you can hang it on.

107
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,240
亲爱的，把艾普丽尔叫进来好吗？天快黑了
Honey, have April come in, okay?It's gonna be dark soon.

108
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,675
好的
Okay.

109
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,878
过来，艾普丽尔！妈妈让我们进屋
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

110
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,716
看我找到了什么，辛蒂
Look what I found, Cindy.

111
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,714
一
One...

112
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,276
二
...two...

113
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,556
三
...three.

114
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,598
快，快，快，不准偷看
Come on, come on, come on.No peeking.

115
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,114
四
Four.

116
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,438
披萨吃完了吗？我不希望浪费
Are you guys done with the pizza?I don't want it going to waste.

117
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,035
快走  - 养你们这群小丫头很费钱啊
Let's go.  - It's expensive feeding you girls.

118
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,591
七，八，九
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

119
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,910
我该躲哪里？
Where should I hide?

120
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,272
准备好了吗，我来了！
Ready or not, here I come!

121
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,029
好，拍手
Okay, clap.

122
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,597
哇噢！  - 你们对这屋子还不熟悉
Whoa!  - Guys,You don't know the house well enough.

123
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,830
有人会受伤的
Someone's gonna get hurt.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,275
我没事，我没事
I'm okay, I'm okay.

125
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,560
拍第二次
Second clap.

126
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,080
这是作弊
That's cheating.

127
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,955
拍手
Clap.

128
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,874
抓住你了！
Got you!

129
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,517
你没事吧？  - 还好
Are you okay?  - Um,Yeah.

130
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,554
弄坏了什么东西？
All right, what did we break now?

131
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,712
我不是故意的  - 麻烦请出来
I didn't mean to.  - Move out of there, please.

132
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,633
是克里斯蒂的错
It was Christine's fault.

133
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,031
老天  - 我的错？上帝啊
Oh, jeez.  - My fault? Oh, my God.

134
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,112
是克里斯蒂干的  - 不，我没有
Christine did it.  - No, I didn't.

135
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,431
你推我的  - 不，不，你自己退过去的
You pushed me.  - No, no, you fell back.

136
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,274
南希，帮我拿一下火柴，好吗？
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me the matches, please?

137
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,316
怎么了？
What's going on?

138
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,777
南希弄坏东西了  - 闭嘴
Nancy broke something.  - Shut up.

139
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:24,585
是你！
It was you!

140
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,512
什么坏了？  - 是墙
What broke?  - It's the wall.

141
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,718
哇噢！  - 我觉得好像是个地下室什么的
Whoa!  - I think we have a cellar or something.

142
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,280
我要看，我要看，让开，让开，让开
I wanna see, I wanna see. Move, move, move.

143
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,555
来，火柴，谢谢
Here, matches.Thank you.

144
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,753
我要看  - 你会看到的
I wanna see.  - You can see.

145
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,673
我要看嘛  - 你们都会看到的
I wanna see.  - You can all see.

146
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,035
走开！
Move!

147
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,072
天
Oh, man.

148
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,909
罗杰？
Roger?

149
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,355
下面有什么？
What do you see down there?

150
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,039
只是…呃，很难解释
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

151
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,156
一架旧钢琴，还有一堆垃圾
It's an old piano and a whole bunch of garbage.

152
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,716
啊，妈的…
Ah. Son of a...

153
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,953
哇噢
Wow.

154
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,234
罗杰？
Roger?

155
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,000
上来吧
Come on up.

156
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,959
我不希望你们下去那里
I don't want you girls going down there.

157
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,839
那里都是蜘蛛  - 呕！
That place is loaded with spiders.  - Ew!

158
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,076
别紧张
Just relax.

159
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,550
别这样，南希，这不好玩
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

160
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,431
不管怎么说，我们有更多空间了，明早我再下去看看
We've got extra square footage anyway.I'll check it out in the morning.

161
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,791
我在想为什么要封起来  - 不知道
I wonder why it was boarded up.  - I don't know.

162
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,996
好了，孩子们，演出结束
Okay,guys.Show's over.

163
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,879
再五分钟  - 一分都不行
Five minutes.  - No more minutes.

164
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,396
赶紧上床，谢谢合作  - 上床
Up to bed. Please. Thank you.  - Right to bed.

165
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
累死了
Man, I'm fried.

166
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,473
赛迪有点不对劲
Something's up with Sadie.

167
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,590
是啊，不知道她怎么了，就是不肯进来
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.Couldn't get her to come inside.

168
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,553
我们不能把她扔在那
We can't leave her out there.

169
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,871
没事的，我把她拴链子上了
She's all right. I got her on a chain.

170
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,959
赛迪，安静点
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

171
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,952
谢谢把这一切变为可能
Thanks for making this work.

172
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,998
我知道还有很多事要做
I know it was a lot to bite off.

173
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,309
会好起来，对吗？
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

174
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,752
我觉得已经很好了
I think it's great already.

175
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,110
是啊
Yeah.

176
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,994
你还累的无法打理新房子吗？
You still too fried to christen the new house?

177
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,440
谁说我累坏了？
Who said I'm fried?

178
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,994
谁都没有累坏
Ain't nobody here's fried.

179
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,589
妈妈？
Mom?

180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,196
嗨，你们睡的还好吗？
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

181
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,550
我好冷
I'm cold.

182
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,234
的确有点凉
It is chilly, isn't it?

183
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,236
我们可以买一栋厕所实际可用的房子吗？
Do you think maybe we could have bought a house with a toilet that actually works?

184
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,436
跟你爸说去
Tell your father.

185
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,718
昨晚我房间里还有股怪味，好像什么东西死了一样
And there was a funky smell in my room last night. Like something died.

186
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,473
现在还有吗？  - 没了
Is it still there?  - No.

187
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,676
那就没问题了
Problem solved.

188
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,550
罗杰？
Roger?

189
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,520
罗杰？
Roger?

190
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,434
在下面，亲爱的
Down here, honey.

191
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,636
早上好
Morning.

192
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,720
这可真得花一番大工夫了
This is gonna take some serious elbow grease.

193
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,070
是啊
Yeah.

194
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,873
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

195
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,632
这些东西该怎么处理？
What are we gonna do with all this stuff?

196
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,235
或许我们该先整理一下
Well, we probably ought to go through it

197
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,790
知道吗？可能有些很值钱的古董
You know?There might be some antiques down here worth a lot of  money.

198
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,634
或者只是一堆前任房主不要的废物
Yeah, or just a lot of junk the previous owner didn't want.

199
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,117
现在是我们的了  - 别做梦了
It's ours now.  - Knock yourself out.

200
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,757
我去煮点咖啡  - 好的
I'm gonna make some coffee.  - Okay.

201
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,957
我很快就上来，我要试试能否把这炉子修好
I'll be up in a minute,I'm gonna see if I can get this furnace working.

202
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,918
那就太好了，这里冷死了
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

203
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,230
是啊
Yeah.

204
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,034
赛迪！来这里，赛迪！
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

205
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,635
妈咪！
Mommy!

206
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,274
妈咪，赛迪在哪？
Mommy, where's Sadie?

207
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,753
她在外面，她现在一定很饿了，你去把她带过来吧
She's outside. You know, I'm sure she's hungry by now. Why don't you go and get her.

208
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,796
早上好，爸爸
Morning, Dad.

209
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,952
可以帮我拿一下吗？  - 当然
Can you hold this?  - Sure.

210
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,793
赛迪！  - 慢点，小皮猴
Sadie!  - Slow it down, Scoot.

211
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,235
罗杰  - 怎么
Roger.  - Yeah.

212
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,558
这钟停在了3:07，走廊那个也是
This clock stopped at 3:07,and so did the one in the hallway.

213
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
这倒挺奇怪的
That's weird.

214
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,798
可能是搬家的时候撞坏了吧
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

215
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,839
说到撞坏，你昨晚对我做了什么？
Speaking of knocked around,what did you do to me last night?

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,754
这不是我干的，是我弄的吗？  - 我不知道
Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?  - I don't know.

217
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,355
赛迪！
Sadie!

218
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,356
艾普丽尔！艾普丽尔！
April! April!

219
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,115
怎么…？艾普丽尔！发生什么事了？
What's...? April! What's going on?

220
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,590
怎么了？  - 上帝啊！
What happened?  - Oh, my God!

221
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
噢，赛迪
Oh, Sadie.

222
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:09,884
门罗，康乃狄克州，沃伦家

223
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,557
我们把所有东西都锁在这里了
We keep everything locked in here.

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,753
请随便参观
Feel free to look around.

225
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,793
就是别碰任何东西
Just don't touch anything.

226
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,759
哇噢
Wow.

227
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,520
太疯狂了
This is crazy.

228
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,433
这些都是从你们调查的案子中得来的吗？
So all these are taken from cases you've investigated?

229
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,560
是的，你所看到的一切，不是被诅咒的…
That's right. Everything you see in here is either haunted, cursed...

230
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,673
…就是曾被用于某种仪式的器物
...or has been used in some kind of ritualistic practice.

231
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,993
没有一样是玩具
Nothing's a toy.

232
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,833
甚至是那个玩具猴子
Not even the toy monkey.

233
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,714
别碰
Don't touch it.

234
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,392
好吧，是这些不可怕，还是你一点都不担心…
Oh,  Well, isn't it scary,or doesn't it worry you...

235
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,836
把这些东西放在家里？
...to have all these items right in your home?

236
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,391
所以我们才让牧师每个月来这房间赐福一次
That's why we have a priest that comes by once a month to bless the room.

237
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,755
我觉得…
Well, the way I see it is...

238
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,560
这些东西放这里比放在别的地方更安全
It's safer for these things to be in here than out there.

239
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,518
就跟不把枪带上街一个道理
It's kind of like keeping guns off the street.

240
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,752
为什么不把这些扔进焚化炉销毁掉？
Why not just throw them in an incinerator? Destroy them.

241
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,838
那样只是毁了它们的皮囊
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

242
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,159
还是把妖怪封在瓶子里更好
Sometimes it's better to keep the genie in the bottle.

243
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,194
说起来，安娜贝尔娃娃在这里吗？
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

244
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,474
这边走
Right this way.

245
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,075
好的
Yeah.

246
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,315
你说她只是个载体？  - 正确
You said she's a conduit?  - That's right.

247
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,675
那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

248
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,675
一个非常强大的恶魔把自己附着在她身上
A very powerful demonic has latched itself onto her.

249
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,799
那当你们在调查这些事件的时候…
So when you guys investigate these hauntings...

250
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,191
…是如何避免被他们缠上的呢？
...how do you stop them from latching onto you?

251
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,919
我们会做好一切预防措施
We have to take great precaution.

252
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,713
那你妻子呢？
But what about your wife?

253
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,954
她怎么了？
What about her?

254
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,878
哥顿神父告诉我…
Well, Father Gordon told me that...

255
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
那是不一样的
Well, that was different.

256
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,879
驱魔的时经常会有这样的事情发生
What happened to my wife happened during an exorcism.

257
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,713
有什么区别？
Well, what's the difference?

258
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,755
抱歉
Excuse me.

259
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,789
亲爱的，你在干吗？
Honey, what are you doing?

260
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,390
过来
Come here.

261
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,910
你更了解，是吗？
You know better. All right?

262
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,514
乔治安娜？
Georgiana?

263
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,076
你碰过什么东西吗？  - 没有
Come on. Did you touch anything?  - No.

264
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,560
好的，过来，亲爱的
All right, come on, honey.

265
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
乔治安娜！把朱蒂带上楼好吗？  - 噢，当然
Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?  - Oh, sure.

266
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,589
无论如何你都不能进那间房间，还记得吗？
You can't go into this room,no matter what, remember?

267
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,194
是的，爸爸  - 好的
Yes, Daddy.  - All right.

268
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,270
去吧  - 好的，过来
Go on.  - Okay, come on.

269
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,478
我去给你找点零食，好吗？来吧
Let's see if I can find you a little snack, okay? Come on.

270
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,791
你们在做什么？
Hey. What's going on in here?

271
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,429
爸爸，看  - 你真漂亮
Daddy, look.  - You look very pretty.

272
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,956
好了，完成了，穿好衣服吃饭去
All right, all done.Go get dressed for dinner.

273
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,954
我就穿这个去吃饭  - 不，不行
I'm wearing it to dinner.  - No, you're not!

274
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,355
给你
Here you go.

275
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,440
怎么样了？
How'd it go?

276
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,717
我觉得他或许是想写一篇正面报道
Oh, I think he may write a positive article.

277
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,792
噢，一个有神论者
Ooh, a non-skeptic.

278
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,675
这是个不错的改变
That's a pleasant change.

279
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,990
是的
Yeah.

280
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,633
别再自责了
Stop blaming yourself.

281
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,034
没放糖
No sugar.

282
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,674
很快回来
Be right back.

283
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,437
这不好玩，南希
Not funny, Nancy.

284
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,829
什么？
What?

285
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,597
别抓我的脚
Stop grabbing my foot.

286
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,917
闭嘴，我什么都没做
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

287
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,194
是啊，是啊
Yeah, right.

288
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,877
别再放屁了
And stop farting.

289
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,118
真的很臭
It really stinks.

290
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,031
别怪我头上，是你自己
Don't blame that on me. It's you.

291
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,390
老爸？
Dad?

292
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,592
安德莉亚，为什么不睡觉？
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

293
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,035
那是什么声音？
What's that sound?

294
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,114
是辛蒂，她在我房间，她又梦游了
It's Cindy. She's in my room.She's sleepwalking again.

295
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,677
我从没见过她这样子
I've never seen her do this before.

296
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,230
我记得你说梦游的时候不要吵醒她
I remembered you saying not to wake her if she's like this.

297
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,312
是的，我们把她放回床里
No, we just put her back to bed.

298
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,995
嗨，嗨，宝贝，嘘
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

299
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,155
我们回床里去
Let's go back to bed.

300
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,953
她没事了，晚安
She's okay. Good night.

301
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,315
晚安
Night.

302
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,438
她又梦游了？好久都没这样过了
She's sleepwalking again?She hasn't done that for awhile.

303
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,192
她停在了安德莉亚的房间里，吓坏她了
She ended up in Andrea's room too.I think kind of freaked her out.

304
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,955
这不太妙，我们该怎么做？  - 不知道
That's not good. What are we gonna do?  - I don't know.

305
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,680
亲爱的，这里又有一块淤青了  - 嗯？
Honey, you got another bruise here.  - Hmm?

306
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,280
疼吗？
Does that hurt?

307
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,356
真奇怪
That's weird.

308
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,473
我不知道，要不要去看一下医生？
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,go see a doctor for that?

309
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,596
好，我会的，开车小心  - 知道了
Yeah, I will. Drive safe.  - Yeah.

310
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,479
我爱你  - 我也爱你
I love you.  - I love you too.

311
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,076
再见！
Bye!

312
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
爱你们！
Love you!

313
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,759
辛蒂，拿午餐了吗？  - 拿了
Cindy, you have your lunch?  - Yeah.

314
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,391
是的
Yes, I do.

315
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,392
我很想赛迪
I miss Sadie a lot.

316
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,916
她是我最好的朋友
She was my best friend.

317
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,998
你是我的朋友，对吗？
You're my friend, right?

318
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,239
好的，我们一起玩吧
Yeah, let's play.

319
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,114
你在跟谁说话？  - 罗利
Who are you talking to?  - Rory.

320
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,670
罗利？
Rory?

321
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,072
他是我的新朋友  - 噢，是吗？
He's my new friend.  - Oh, really?

322
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,312
是的，你想见他吗？  - 好啊，怎么见？
Yeah, do you want to see him?  - Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

323
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,914
用这个
With this.

324
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,756
当音乐停的时候，你会看到他在镜子里，站在你身后
When the music stops, you see him in the mirror standing behind you.

325
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,790
好吧
Okay.

326
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,872
但你得拧发条
But you have to twist the key.

327
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,235
好的
Okay.

328
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
砰！妈咪！  - 噢！
Boo, Mommy!  - Oh!

329
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,879
艾普丽尔，你吓死我了  - 中招！
April, you just gave me a heart attack.  - Got you!

330
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,912
好吧，我猜罗利不想见我，是吗？
Well, okay, I guess Rory doesn't want to see me, huh?

331
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,309
噢，好吧
Oh, well.

332
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,153
我们可以玩捉迷藏吗？
Can we play hide-and-clap?

333
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,596
捉迷…？噢，亲爱的，我不想玩
Hide-and-cla--?Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

334
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,356
求你！她们都不让我玩  - 好吧，好吧
Please! Nobody ever lets me play.  - Okay, okay.

335
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,317
记住，你得要求我拍三次手
Remember, you get to ask me for three claps.

336
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,516
好的
Okay.

337
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,878
一，二，三
One, two, three.

338
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,679
我要躲起来了！  - 好的
I'm gonna go hide now!  - Okay.

339
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,514
四，五…
Four, five...

340
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,559
六，七…
...six, seven...

341
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,076
八，九…
...eight, nine...

342
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,955
十！
...ten!

343
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,154
拍第一次手！
First clap!

344
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,478
噢，该死
Ow. Shit.

345
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,154
拍第二次手！
Second clap!

346
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,036
艾普丽尔
April.

347
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,434
艾普丽尔
April.

348
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,674
我知道你藏在哪里
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

349
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,951
拍第三次手
Give me the third clap.

350
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,954
我要把你抓出来喽
I'm gonna get you now.

351
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,039
我听到你呼吸了
I can hear you breathing.

352
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,040
艾普丽尔
April.

353
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,440
艾普丽尔
April.

354
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,436
你把眼罩拿下来了，我赢了！
You took your blindfold off. I win!

355
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,475
你一点都不用心，妈妈，我在克里斯蒂跟南希的房间
You weren't even warm, Mom.I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

356
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,795
总得给我留一条路线，不然我会失去卡车保险的
I gotta have some routes here,or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.

357
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,480
这才只有半价啊，兄弟
That's like half of my rate, man.

358
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,152
嗯，好的
Yeah, okay.

359
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,232
我…好吧，我接下了
I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll take it.

360
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,675
谢谢
Thank you.

361
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,359
什么路线？  - 是…佛罗里达
What's the route?  - It's, uh, Florida.

362
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,240
往返一个星期，我明天出发
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

363
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,554
我们会撑过去的
We'll get through this.

364
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,596
是的
Yeah.

365
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,080
来，去睡觉吧
Come on, let's go to bed.

366
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,996
住手，南希，这一点都不好玩
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

367
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,232
我要睡觉，求你别再抓我的脚了
I'm trying to sleep,please stop grabbing my feet.

368
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,034
南希？
Nancy?

369
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,599
南希？
Nancy?

370
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,719
你在干吗？
What are you doing?

371
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,640
克里斯蒂？
Christine?

372
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,430
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

373
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
你看到了吗？
Do you see it?

374
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,755
看到什么？
See what?

375
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,311
有人在门后
There's someone behind the door.

376
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,709
什么？
What?

377
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,920
有个人站在那里
There's someone standing over there.

378
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,396
我没看到任何人
I don't see anyone.

379
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,150
它正看着我们
It's looking right at us.

380
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,920
南希，不要！南希
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

381
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,515
不，不，你看，你看
No, no. Look. Look.

382
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,151
看，没有人，看到了吗？
Look, there's no one...no one here. See?

383
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,794
又是那味道
Ugh. It's that smell again.

384
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,271
噢，上帝啊
Oh, my God.

385
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,913
它就站在你背后
It's standing right behind you.

386
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,918
克里斯蒂？！克里斯蒂！克里斯蒂！
Christine?! Christine! Christine!

387
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,440
天，开不了…
God, it won't op...

388
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,712
克里斯蒂！  - 不！不！不！
Christine!  - No! No! No!

389
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,913
怎么了？发生什么事了？  - 有个人在这里！
What's going on? What happened?  - There was someone else in here!

390
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,116
什么？  - 哪里？
What?  - Where?

391
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,557
门边，它在门背后
By the door. It was behind the door.

392
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,275
宝贝，什么都没有，没人在那里
Honey, there's nothing in here.There's nobody in here.

393
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,238
有个人在这里！
There was someone else in here!

394
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,838
我正在睡觉，然后觉得有人抓着我的脚
I was just sleeping, and then I felt somebody grab my feet.

395
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,310
我以为是南希
So I thought it was Nancy.

396
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,797
宝贝，我非常确定那只是个噩梦
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure that it was just a bad dream.

397
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,555
不是！它跟我说话了！
No! It talked to me!

398
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,638
它说…
It said...

399
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,870
它想要我们全家都死掉
...that it wants my family dead.

400
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,389
温斯顿先生！
Mr. Winston!

401
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,553
温斯顿？温斯顿？
Winston? Winston?

402
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
到他后面
Get behind him.

403
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,156
你要去哪？
Where you off to?

404
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,789
打算去店里买点东西
I just gotta run to the store for a few things.

405
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,959
为什么要这样？  - 什么？什么意思？
Why do you even try?  - What? What do you mean?

406
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,680
15年来，你有哪次是能骗过我的？
In 15 years have you ever been able to lie to me?

407
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,799
哥顿神父打电话来，说他有个案子想让我们跟进一下
Father Gordon called. He's got a case he wants us to look into.

408
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,520
我说我会过去看看的，罗琳，是“我”会
I said I'd go check it out myself.Lorraine, myself.

409
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,034
我跟你一起去
I'm going with you.

410
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,270
我知道你担心那个会再次发生
I know you're worried it's gonna happen again.

411
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,238
是啊，千真万确
Yeah, I am. I really am.

412
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,920
或许我们该歇一歇了，写本书什么的
Maybe it's just time we take a break.Write that book.

413
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,954
还记得结婚那晚你跟我说了什么吗？
Do you remember what you said to me on our wedding night?

414
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,959
“能再来一次吗？”
"Can we do it again?"

415
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,990
在这之后
After that.

416
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,229
你说上帝把我们撮合在一起是有原因的，对吗？
You said that God brought us together for a reason. Right?

417
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,359
我很确定不是为了写书什么的
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

418
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,713
我去穿件衣服
I'm gonna get dressed.

419
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,356
我们已经确定那东西就在这阁楼上
We've isolated the disturbances to the attic.

420
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
你们听
Now I just want you to listen for a second.

421
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,270
噢，上帝啊，就是这个
Oh, my God, that's it.

422
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,354
再来一次，艾德
Do it again, Ed.

423
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,551
现在只是我在踩地板而已，但你们从水管里放水的时候
Right now it's just my weight.But you take the water coming off the pipe...

424
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,280
会把风从那破窗子里带进来
...combined with the wind coming through the broken window...

425
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,750
然后这些木条就会胀大，互相摩擦
...these boards are gonna expand and rub against each other.

426
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,715
满屋子都有这声音，是因为这些管子是连着暖气片的
You heard it all through the house because of these pipes leading to the radiator.

427
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,832
所以这地方并没有闹鬼？
So this place isn't haunted?

428
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,593
是的，不太可能
No, it rarely is.

429
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,555
有时候的确是可以有合理解释的
Yeah, there's usually always some kind of rational explanation.

430
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,440
丫头们，该睡觉了
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

431
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
是谁？
Who is that?

432
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
谁在下面，我要把你关起来了
Who's ever down there,I'm gonna lock you in now!

433
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,434
救命！
Help!

434
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,398
安德莉亚，救命！
Andrea! Help!

435
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,515
嗨，想玩捉迷藏吗？
Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?

436
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,389
辛蒂？
Cindy?

437
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,032
好吧，那…
Okay, now....

438
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,509
是这样吗？
All right?

439
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,274
没错，过来
All right, come on.

440
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,869
过来
Come on.

441
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,115
就这样
There you go.

442
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,077
好了，今晚就跟我一起睡了，好吗？
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,all right?

443
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,314
来
There you go.

444
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,870
对了
There.

445
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,955
安德莉亚？  - 救命！救命！救命！
Andrea?  - Help! Help! Help!

446
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,753
谁在里面？  - 安德莉亚？
Who's in here?  - Andrea!

447
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,116
安德莉亚？安德莉亚！
Andrea? Andrea!

448
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,396
在这里！
In here!

449
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,035
救命，爸爸！救命，是安德莉亚！
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

450
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,634
谁在这里？  - 安德莉亚！
Who's in here?  - Andrea!

451
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,600
发生什么事了？
What happened?

452
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,195
该死的，谁能告诉我这里发生了什么事？
Somebody, goddamn it,tell me what's going on here?

453
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,270
恐惧就是，未知事物或强烈危机感所致的…
Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation and anxiety caused by the presence...

454
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,954
情绪波动及焦虑
...or imminence of danger.

455
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,632
无论是鬼魂、妖魔还是邪物，都以此为生
Whether it's a ghost, a spirit or an entity, they all feed on it.
(马萨诸塞西部大学，韦克菲尔德)

456
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,836
这是莫里斯
Take Maurice here.

457
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,192
一个三年级都没念完的加籍法裔农民
A French-Canadian farmer with no more than a third-grade education...

458
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,876
被附身之后，说着一口我听过最标准的拉丁语
...yet after he was possessed,spoke some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

459
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,269
有时还倒过来说
Sometimes backwards.

460
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,150
他一直被他的父亲骚扰、折磨着
He'd been molested by his father,who had also tortured him repeatedly.

461
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,796
一个把他当做宿主的暗灵
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

462
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,398
你们看他的眼睛，会发现他在流血泪
Now, if you look into his eyes,you can see him tearing blood.

463
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,394
还有这样…
And like that...

464
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,713
…从身体里浮现出一个倒十字架
...an upside-down cross started to appear from within his body.

465
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,671
好，德鲁，可以开灯了
All right, Drew, you can hit the lights.

466
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,716
你会亲自主持驱魔仪式吗？
Did you personally perform the exorcism?

467
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,719
不，我没有被授权，但我协助过很多
No, I'm not authorized.But I've assisted on many.

468
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,832
要知道，驱魔是非常危险的…
See, an exorcism can be very dangerous...

469
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,038
不仅只对受害者而言，对屋里的所有人都一样
...not only for the victim,but for anyone in the room.

470
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,110
莫里斯怎样了？  - 他试图杀了他妻子…
What happened to Maurice?  - He tried to kill his wife...

471
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,632
…但只打伤了她的胳膊，然后他把枪对准了自己
...but instead shot her in the arm and then turned the gun on himself.

472
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,237
莫里斯的生活很悲惨…
Maurice had a very troubled life with little to live for...

473
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,279
…甚至连驱魔都无法救回他
...and not even an exorcist could bring him back.

474
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,878
由此，让我们看一下恶魔活动的三个阶段
Which brings us to the three stages of demonic activity:

475
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,271
出现，骚扰，附身
Infestation, oppression and possession.

476
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,794
首先，“出现”
Now, infestation:

477
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,920
一般就是说话声、脚步声以及感觉有另外一个人存在…
That's the whispering, the footsteps,the feeling of another presence...

478
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,750
…很快就会发展成第二阶段“骚扰”，
...which ultimately grows into oppression, the second stage.

479
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,196
所以受害者一般都是那些…
Now this is where the victim,and it's usually the one...

480
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,238
…比较容易受外部力量影响的…
...who's the most psychologically vulnerable...

481
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,279
…心理承受能力比较差的人
...is targeted specifically by an external force.

482
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,877
把受害者吓倒，摧毁他们的意志
Breaks the victim down.Crushes their will.

483
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,280
在他们最脆弱的时候，就发展到了最后也就是第三阶段，“附身”
And, once in a weakened state, leads them to the third and final stage: possession.

484
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,999
嗨，艾德？罗琳？  - 是的
Hey, Ed? Lorraine?  - Yeah.

485
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,595
有人想跟你们聊聊
There's someone here that would like to talk to you.

486
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,796
嗨  - 谢谢，德鲁
Hi.  - Thanks, Drew.

487
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,440
谢谢  - 没事，待会儿见
Thank you.  - Sure，I'll see you later.

488
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,670
有什么可以帮你的？
How can we help you?

489
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,153
我房子里发生了很可怕的事情，你们可以来看一下吗？
There's something horrible happening in my house. Could you come and take a look?

490
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,272
嗯…呃…今天有点晚了
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

491
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,194
我们要回家了  - 不，你们不明白
We really need to be head to our family.  - No,You don't understand.

492
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,239
事实上我们知道，很多东西是可以有合理解释的…
But we do. There's usually some sort of rational explanation...

493
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,156
我五个女儿都被吓坏了，我担心这东西会伤害我们
I have five daughters who are scared to death.I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

494
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,155
你们也有女儿，难道你们就不会竭尽所能去保护她吗？求你们
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do anything you could to protect her? Please.

495
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,516
求你们来看一下可以吗？
Please can you come and take a look?

496
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,235
好的，当然
Of course we will.

497
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,600
好的，当然
Of course we will.

498
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,433
孩子们，赶紧整理一下，谢谢
Hey,You guys straighten up? Thanks.

499
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,680
你好  - 嗨
Hello. Hi.  - Hi. Hi.

500
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,240
非常感谢能来
Thanks for coming.

501
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,713
你好，我是罗杰  - 罗琳
Hi, I'm Roger.  - Lorraine.

502
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,196
你好，幸会，罗杰，我是艾德·沃伦
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

503
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,638
非常感谢能来  - 请进来吧
Thanks for coming.  - Please, come in.

504
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,035
谢谢
Thank you.

505
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,670
那…
So....

506
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,833
噢，天啊，看看，这些美女们都是谁？
Oh, my God. Look at you all.Who are these beautiful young women?

507
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,357
这是安德莉亚，老大，南希、辛蒂、克里斯蒂…
This is Andrea, the oldest,Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

508
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,119
…还有艾普丽尔
...and April.

509
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,274
这是沃伦先生和沃伦太太
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

510
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,554
我们现在都睡在楼下
We're all sleeping down here now.

511
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,754
孩子们有点安全感，也更暖和一些
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

512
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,636
我一直开着暖气，但这房子就是冷得要命
I'm constantly turning up the heat,but the house is always freezing.

513
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,712
炉子没什么问题
It's not a problem with the furnace.

514
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,155
我是说，我找不出原因
I mean, not that I can find.

515
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,155
前几晚情况越来越糟糕了
It's gotten a lot worse the past few nights.

516
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,039
有股难闻的味道，像烂肉一样，满屋子都是
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.It moves around the house.

517
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,070
呃…
Uh....

518
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,435
什么？怎么了？
What? What is it?

519
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,519
腐臭味有可能是某种恶魔活动征兆
Well, rancid smells could indicate some type of demonic activity.

520
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,830
噢，上帝啊
Oh, my God.

521
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,556
这是为了防止晚上发出碰门声
That's to keep those doors from banging at night.

522
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,157
不然，整晚都会像这样响个不停
Otherwise, it's like...All night long, just like that.

523
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,637
每天都会发生？  - 是的
Does it come in threes?  - Yeah.

524
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,950
天亮就停？
It stops at dawn?

525
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,755
对
Uh-huh.

526
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,037
有时这意味着对三圣的不敬
Well, sometimes it's meant as an insult to the Trinity:

527
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,157
圣父、圣子、圣灵
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

528
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,476
知道吗，这是非常邪恶的东西，但我们有办法…
You know, it's the damndest thing,but we also get all kinds of birds...

529
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,639
…可以把它从这房子里找出来消灭掉
...that will just fly against the side of the house and break their necks.

530
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,439
是吗？
Hm. Really?

531
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,030
钟都停在了凌晨3:07
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

532
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,271
所有的？  - 每个都是
All of them?  - Every one.

533
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,434
噢，这些原本都是挂在楼梯上的
Oh, we were hanging those along the stairs.

534
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,879
有东西老是会把它们弄下来，所以就不挂回去了
Something just kept knocking them down,so we stopped hanging them up.

535
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,596
我一直在说
That's what I was talking about.

536
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,673
我们搬来的时候它就已经在了
It was here when we moved in.

537
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,036
地下室里还有很多东西
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

538
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,440
带我去地下室看看
Show me the cellar.

539
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,155
看看她都让我干了些什么
Look what she made me do.

540
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,790
发现什么了吗，亲爱的？
You picking up anything in here, hon?

541
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,274
这里发生过很可怕的事情，艾德
Something awful happened here, Ed.

542
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,312
这些淤青，是来这里之后出现的吗？
Those bruises, they from something that happened here?

543
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,520
这是因为我身体缺铁什么的
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

544
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,070
发生了那么多事，你们为什么不搬走？
You know, with all that's been going on,why haven't you just moved out?

545
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,357
不知道我们可以搬去哪
I don't know where we'd move to, you know?

546
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,833
我们把所有钱都花在了这里，还进行了很多整修
We got all our money tied up in this place and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

547
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,474
我也不知道谁可以长期收留我们一家七口人
And I don't know anybody whose gonna take in a family of seven indefinitely.

548
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,558
所以我们找到了你们
That's why we tracked you down.

549
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,793
很荣幸你们能来找我们
We're glad you found us.

550
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,590
好，开始吧
All right, let's get started.

551
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,157
我叫艾德·沃伦，今天是1971年11月1日
My name is Ed Warren.It's November 1st, 1971.

552
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,352
我现在跟卡洛琳·佩伦坐在一起…
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

553
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,719
…她的家庭正经历着灵异事件
...who, with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.

554
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,120
好，开始吧
Okay, go ahead.

555
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,040
从哪里说起？
Where do I start?

556
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,273
从初次异常现象开始
From the first occurrence.

557
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,357
我觉得应该是那些钟
I guess it was the clocks.

558
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,477
爸爸妈妈跟我说你有个朋友
Mom and Dad tell me that you have a friend.

559
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,871
他叫罗利，他也住在这里
His name's Rory.He lives here too.

560
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,872
嗯  - 但他一直很悲伤
Hmm.  - But he's always sad.

561
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,076
为什么？
Why is that?

562
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,029
他不告诉我，可能有什么不好的事情发生在他身上了
He won't tell me but I think something bad happened to him.

563
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,991
可以让我见见罗利吗？
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

564
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,150
嗨
Hey.

565
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,195
怎么了？
What is it?

566
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,479
我们是从银行拍卖来的，所以不知道之前谁住在这里
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,you know, we never knew who lived here.

567
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,360
罗琳跟我都觉得你们的房子需要“清洁”一下
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that what your house needs is a cleansing.

568
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,835
一场驱魔仪式
An exorcism.

569
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,874
什么，驱魔？
What, exorcism?

570
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,799
我一直以为驱魔是仅针对人的
I thought that was something that you do to people.

571
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,354
不，不一定的
No, not necessarily, no.

572
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,320
我们得离开这里
We have to get out of here.

573
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,472
恐怕这于事无补
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

574
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,796
罗琳看到了一些…
Lorraine saw something, which--

575
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,235
你说吧，亲爱的
Go ahead, hon.

576
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,037
我看到你们的房子里有邪恶之物出没
I've been seeing the dark entity that haunts your house...

577
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,714
…外面也有
...and your land.

578
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,756
第一次看到它是在走进你们家门的时候
I saw it first when I came through your door.

579
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,116
它就靠在你背上
It was latched to your back.

580
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,679
第二次是在走进客厅的时候，它跟女孩们在一起
And then I saw it again with the girls when we walked into the living room.

581
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,876
无论你们去哪里…
And it doesn't matter where you go...

582
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,198
…这邪物会一直跟着你们
...this dark entity has latched itself to your family...

583
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,874
…吸食你们
...and it's feeding off you.

584
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,077
哪怕我们离开也一样？
Even if we leave?

585
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,914
有时候鬼缠身，就像是踩到了口香糖
Sometimes when you get haunted,it's like stepping on gum.

586
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,358
会一直粘着你
You take it with you.

587
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,512
我得说，你们这里有很多幽灵…
Look, I gotta tell you,you have a lot of spirits in here...

588
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,277
…但这个是我们最担心的，因为它充满了仇恨
...but this is the one that I'm most worried about, because it is so hateful.

589
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,999
好吧，那我们该怎么做？叫个牧师来吗？
Okay, so what do we do?Can we call a priest?

590
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,480
那么简单就好了
I wish it were that easy.

591
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,634
驱魔是一种很古老的仪式，需要很多年的训练
Performing an exorcism is an archaic procedure. Requires years of training.

592
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,560
哪怕这样，惨剧还是会时常发生
And even then,I have seen it go horribly wrong.

593
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,230
但在这之前，首先要获得教堂的授权
But before we even get that far,the church has to authorize it first.

594
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,632
就是说我们要调查、收集证物及提供证据…
It means we gotta investigate,gather evidence and provide proof...

595
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,320
…这才是难点
...and that's the hard part.

596
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,199
孩子们受过洗礼吗？
Have your children been baptized?

597
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,673
不，没有，我们不常去教堂
Uh, no, we never got around to that.We're not really a churchgoing family.

598
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,516
或许应该重新考虑一下，我们的出现或许会让事情更糟糕
Well, you may want to rethink that.Our presence here could make things worse.

599
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,796
为什么？
Why?

600
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,314
因为我们是个威胁
Because we're a threat.

601
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,399
这里这家伙不太会喜欢我们
And whatever you're dealing with here isn't gonna like us.

602
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,110
目前为止它还没施过暴，这是个好现象
So far it hasn't done anything violent,and that's a good sign.

603
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,199
所以我们会让我们的人调查一下这里…
So we're gonna have our guy do some homework on the property...

604
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,158
…看看我们要对付的是什么东西
...to see what we're up against.

605
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,198
朱蒂，你要干吗？
Judy, what are you up to?

606
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,114
我有礼物给你
I got you a present.

607
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,352
我跟外婆在教堂的庭院市场上买的
Me and Nanna got these at the church's yard sale.

608
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,352
宝贝  - 一个给你，一个给我
Honey.  - One for you and one for me.

609
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,079
她在我这个里…
She put a picture...

610
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,515
…放了你和爸爸的照片
...of you and Daddy in mine.

611
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,192
外婆说这样我们就会永远在一起
Nanna said this way we'll always be together.

612
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,875
你我会一直在一起的
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

613
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,677
我想你和爸爸
I miss you and Daddy.

614
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,436
嗨，亲爱的
Hey, hon.

615
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,716
在
Yup.

616
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,714
你不会相信的，卡洛琳的声音没录下来
You're not gonna believe this.Carolyn's voice didn't record.

617
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,116
什么意思？
What do you mean?

618
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,275
听着
Listen.

619
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,237
我叫艾德·沃伦，今天是1971年11月1日
My name is Ed Warren.It's November 1st, 1971.

620
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,232
现在跟卡洛琳·佩伦坐在一起…
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

621
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,837
…她的家庭正经历着灵异事件
...who, with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.

622
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,554
好，开始吧
Okay, go ahead.

623
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,598
从初次异常现象开始
From the first occurrence.

624
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,475
什么都没有
Nothing.

625
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,230
全程都是
The whole time.

626
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,955
不知怎么回事，发现什么了吗？  - 很多
I don't know. You find anything?  - Lots.

627
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,559
我是说，怪不得他们会经历这些
I mean, it's no wonder they're going through what they are.

628
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,752
这是之前的农场房子
That's the original farmhouse.

629
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,992
是1863年一个名叫杰德森·佘曼的人建造的
It was built in 1863 by a man named Jedson Sherman...

630
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,755
…他娶了一个名叫巴斯希巴的女人
...who was married to a woman named Bathsheba.

631
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,192
艾德，她是玛丽·汤·艾斯黛的亲戚
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

632
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,511
是被指控在赛伦实施巫术行为的女巫之一
She was one of the women accused of witchcraft in Salem.

633
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,592
被判了绞刑  - 哇噢
She was hung during the trials.  - Wow.

634
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,639
巴斯希巴嫁给杰德森之后，生了个孩子…
After Bathsheba married Jedson,they had a baby...

635
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,638
…当孩子7岁的时候…
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

636
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,719
…杰德森发现她在壁炉边献祭
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it in front of the fireplace.

637
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,951
她跑到了码头那的树边…
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

638
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,271
…爬了上去，表达了对撒旦的崇拜
...climbed up, proclaimed her love to Satan...

639
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,320
…诅咒了每一个试图夺走她土地的人，然后上吊自杀了
...cursed anyone who tried to take her land, and hung herself.

640
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,756
宣称的死亡时间是凌晨3:07
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07 in the morning.

641
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,873
那一些事情就有解释了
Well, that explains a few things.

642
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,759
对，还有这个
Yeah, so does this.

643
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,070
她姓沃克，30年代的时候住在那里
Her last name's Walker.She lived there in the '30s.

644
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,318
她有个叫罗利的孩子在树林里神秘失踪了
She had a boy named Rory who ysteriously disappeared in the woods.

645
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,278
然后她在地下室自杀了
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

646
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,356
这还不算完
And that's not all.

647
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,710
自从原本200英亩的农场被分块卖掉之后
So, what was the original 200-acre farm as since been subdivided and sold off.

648
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,880
有个男孩在这个池塘里淹死了，他住在这里
There was another boy who drowned in pond here. He lived in a house over here.

649
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,159
还有一个在附近做佣人的女人，也自杀了
And a woman who worked as a maid in a eighboring home, she committed suicide too.

650
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,912
夺走她土地的人
People who took her land.

651
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,796
现在跟卡洛琳·佩伦坐在一起…
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

652
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,158
…她的家庭正经历着灵异事件
...who, with her family, has been xperiencing supernatural occurrences.

653
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,080
好，开始吧
Okay, go ahead.

654
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,357
从初次异常现象开始
From the first occurrence.

655
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,029
布拉德来了
Here's Brad.

656
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,440
路好找吗？  - 是的
You find it okay?   - Oh, yeah.

657
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,954
德鲁，这是布拉德警官
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

658
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,675
布拉德·汉密尔顿警官，罗德岛哈瑞斯维尔警局的
Officer Brad Hamilton,Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

659
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,718
很高兴见到你
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

660
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,710
你是那个幸运的新警察，是吗？  - 应该是吧
So you're the lucky new cop, huh?  - Guess so.

661
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,038
鬼魂用枪是打不死的，知道吗？  - 对他友好一点，德鲁
You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?  - Take it easy on him, Drew.

662
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,431
好了，兄弟们，帮我把这些东西搬下车
All right, guys,help me get this stuff unloaded.

663
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,074
你拿这个
You take this.

664
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,390
嗨，罗杰
Hi, Roger.

665
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,910
这边好了之后，再上楼去看看，好吗，德鲁？
All right. When you're finished here,why don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

666
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,275
知道了
You got it.

667
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,679
这车哪里坏了？
What's wrong with the Chevy?

668
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,272
她还有哪里是完好的吗？
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

669
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,591
需要换个新化油器才能启动  - 是吗？
Needs a new carburetor to start.  - Oh, yeah?

670
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,872
看来维修得停工一阵子了
Kind of put fixing her up on hold for a while.

671
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,474
嗯，是啊
Yeah. Ahem.

672
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,511
布拉德，把温控器拿给我，好吗？
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,would you?

673
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,150
这是干什么用的？
What's this, uh, do?

674
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,478
当气温瞬间下降的时候…
When there's an instant drop in temperature...

675
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,075
…温控器就会激发相机拍一张照片
...the thermostat triggers the camera to take a picture.

676
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,557
你用这玩意儿拍到过东西吗？
You've actually caught things on film?

677
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,520
是的，这才是重点
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

678
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,232
为什么…为什么在这里？
Why,uh...? Why out here?

679
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,160
这是那女巫自杀的地方
Well, this is where the witch committed suicide.

680
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,953
她在你头顶的那根树枝上吊死了
She hung herself from that branch right above where you're standing.

681
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,312
为什么母亲会杀了她亲生孩子？
How could a mother kill her own child?

682
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,918
对她来说这并不是孩子
It was never a child to her.

683
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,710
她只是把她当作工具来攻击上帝
She just used her God-given gift as the ultimate offense against him.

684
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,952
女巫们相信撒旦可以提升她们的能力
Witches believe it elevates their status in the eyes of Satan.

685
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,511
那天在海滩玩得很开心，是吧？
Wow.That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

686
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,478
你怎么知道的？
How did you know?

687
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,197
这是一种能力，就像是透过窗帘窥视别人的生活一样
It's an insight. It's like a peek through the curtain into another person's life.

688
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,440
那一天对我意义非凡，我们正沿着海岸开车
That day meant so much to me.We were driving along the coast.

689
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,195
南希说那里很漂亮
Nancy pointed out how pretty the view was.

690
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,713
我想这是个拍照的好时机
I thought this is a perfect opportunity for a photo.

691
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,032
我们正打算重新开始，新的房子，新的起点
We're gonna start fresh, you know?A new house, a new beginning.

692
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,557
你也见过罗杰跟姑娘们了，我从没见他们那么开心过
You should have seen Roger and the girls.I've never seen them so happy.

693
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,870
茄子！
Cheese!

694
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,637
他们对我来说就是一切
They mean the world to me.

695
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,072
把你的手平放在桌子上
Put your hand flat on the desk.

696
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,438
好，然后拿开
Yeah, and take it off.

697
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,394
开始了
Here we go.

698
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,876
看到了吗？
See?

699
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,396
这能让我们看到那些肉眼看不到的东西
It just reveals to us what the naked eye can't see.

700
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,080
高科技，是吧？
Pretty far out, isn't it?

701
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,679
是啊，好神奇
Yeah, it's groovy.

702
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,557
德鲁，布拉德的摄像机准备好了吗？
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

703
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,070
是的，一切就绪，先生
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

704
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,115
怎么了？人有三急嘛
What? I had to go.

705
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,800
所有房间信号正常
All the rooms are coming in pretty good.

706
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,189
很好
Good.

707
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,154
瓶子里是什么？
What's in the bottle?

708
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,996
圣水
Holy water.

709
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,550
像这样的宗教信物…
Presence of religious icons...

710
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,758
…会让任何邪恶的东西起反应
...will get a reaction from anything unholy.

711
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,199
类似于激怒他们
Sort of pisses them off.

712
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,991
所以我满屋子都放了这些，看能不能占据点优势
So I set these throughout the house,see if I can stir things up a bit.

713
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,669
就像对着吸血鬼亮出十字架？  - 对，没错
Like holding a cross to a vampire?  - Yeah. Exactly.

714
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,191
除了我不相信有吸血鬼之外
Except I don't believe in vampires.

715
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,509
不是我
Wasn't me.

716
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,520
布拉德，拿上摄像机
Brad, get the camera.

717
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,430
好了
Okay.

718
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,192
现在是晚上9:18，我们准备进入地下室，刚才那里的门自己开了
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

719
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,199
罗琳跟布拉德警官跟我一起
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton with me.

720
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,557
地下室的灯保持关闭
Let's keep the cellar light off.

721
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,394
如果想跟我们交流，就给我们点提示吧
Give us a sign that you wanna communicate with us.

722
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,434
亲爱的，你还好吗？
Hon, you all right?

723
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,235
这里肯定有什么东西
There's definitely something here.

724
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,758
关个门，移动点东西什么的  - 我的手很冷
All right, close the door. Move something.  - My hands are so cold.

725
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,315
来啊
Come on.

726
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,630
不
No.

727
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,439
它走了，它走了
It's gone. It's gone.

728
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,120
我什么都没录到
I got nothing.

729
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,760
好的
Okay.

730
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,797
就像我说的，并不是每次都能如愿以偿
Well, like I said, it doesn't always work when you want it to.

731
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,755
是啊，也许摄像机拍到了点什么
Yeah, maybe the camera picked something up.

732
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,835
小心！
Watch out!

733
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,154
作为无神论者…
For a guy who doesn't believe...

734
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,677
…门摔上的时候你们好像吓傻了嘛
...you looked a little freaked out when that door slammed shut.

735
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,597
肯定是风
It must have been a draft.

736
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,799
噢，滑稽
Oh, that's funny.

737
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,915
风从来不会让我出现那种表情
A draft never put that look on my face before.

738
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,353
我更相信那钟
I believe the clock.

739
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,593
3:08了
It's 3:08.

740
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,359
给我看看你的眼镜
Let me see your glasses.

741
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,716
给你的
For you.

742
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,630
待会儿我想带几个女孩子去吃冰激淋，觉得怎么样？
I think I might take some girls for ice cream later on. What do you say about that?

743
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,991
好的！  - 亲爱的，一起吗？
Yeah!  - Honey, you wanna come?

744
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,198
我累死了，我要睡一会儿，好困
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.The late nights are getting to me.

745
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,750
好主意，你休息一会儿吧
That's probably a good idea.Why don't you get some rest.

746
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,555
罗琳和我会照看这里  - 真的吗？
Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.  - Really?

747
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,440
我要出发了，一小时后我有活
I'm gonna take off.I have a shift starting in an hour.

748
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,751
这个家很久都没有这样了
The house hasn't felt like this in a long time.

749
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,873
有你们在，孩子们有安全感多了
I think the kids feel a lot safer with you around.

750
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,875
我会习惯起来的  - 什么？我洗衣服？
I could get used to this.  - What, me doing laundry?

751
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,832
你真幽默
You're funny.

752
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,994
这地方…
No, this place.

753
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,471
漂亮，新鲜的乡村空气
Nice, fresh country air.

754
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,840
他们有个很幸福的家，是吧？
They have such a beautiful family,don't they?

755
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,203
是啊，那小家伙，艾普丽尔，有没有看到她给我拿煎饼？
Yeah, that little one, April,did you see her bring me pancakes?

756
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:37,884
是的
Yeah!

757
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,513
我们得帮他们
We've gotta help them.

758
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,400
我知道
I know.

759
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,069
从修好那辆车开始
I'll start with the Chevy.

760
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,515
卡洛琳！
Carolyn!

761
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,596
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

762
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,910
卡洛琳，开门
Carolyn, open the door.

763
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,150
卡洛琳，快开门！
Carolyn, open up!

764
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,196
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

765
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,635
我没事  - 你病了吗？
Oh, I'm fine.  - Are you sick?

766
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,634
我醒过来感觉有点想吐，仅此而已  - 我看到了…
I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.  - I thought I saw...

767
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,031
我听到罗杰跟孩子们回来了
I hear Roger and the girls.

768
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,270
稍等
One minute.

769
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,637
姐妹们，想玩游戏吗？  - 无聊！
Guys, do you wanna play a game?  - Boring!

770
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,916
谢谢，爸爸
Thank you, Daddy.

771
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,350
我们进去吧
Let's go inside.

772
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,790
就知道是你
I thought that was you.

773
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,195
希望你不要介意
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

774
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,040
我在史密斯菲尔德的废车场低价买了个拆车件
I got a good deal on a rebuild at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

775
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,278
不，你看起来很精通啊  - 是的，瞧我的
No, you look like you know what you're doing.  - Yeah, we'll see.

776
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,879
这地方不错，罗杰
Got a nice place here, Roger.

777
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,390
罗琳跟我一直想在乡下买套房子
Lorraine and I always wanted a spot in the country.

778
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,880
我把这里卖给你吧
I'll sell you this one.

779
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,594
把扳手递给我
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

780
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,678
嗨，你们能来这里，真是感激不尽
Hey, uh, it really means a lot to us to have you here.

781
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,912
我承认，之前我是有点不相信这些
I gotta admit, I was a little bit skeptical going in.

782
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,272
就想说一声谢谢，对于你们所做的一切
Just wanna say thank you, though,for coming out when you did.

783
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,676
我不能接受这份谢意，这都是罗琳的功劳
I can't take the credit.That's, uh... That's all Lorraine.

784
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,594
我并不想这么做  - 为什么？
I didn't want to.  - Oh. Why's that?

785
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,311
罗琳所看到的、感受到的、接触到的，可以帮助别人
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,it helps people.

786
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,597
但同时也会给她带来伤害
But it also takes a toll on her.

787
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,194
每次一点点
Little piece each time.

788
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,880
几个月前，我们正在处理一个案子
Couple months ago we were working on a case.

789
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,159
她看到了一些东西
She saw something.

790
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,194
造成了很大的伤害
It took a real big piece.

791
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,634
我们回家后…
When we got home...

792
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,833
…她进了房间，把自己锁在了里面…
...she went into our room,locked herself in...

793
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,834
…整整八天，不说，不吃，不出门
...didn't talk, didn't eat,didn't come out for eight days.

794
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,120
她看到了什么？
What'd she see?

795
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,309
出去！
Get out of here!

796
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,629
不知道
I don't know.

797
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,799
我也不会问
And I won't ask.

798
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,552
我要再去倒一杯，你要吗？
I need to reload. You want some?

799
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,554
不用，谢谢
I'm good, thanks.

800
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,675
好吧
All right.

801
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,232
看看她都让我干了些什么
Look what she made me do.

802
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,230
看看她都让我干了些什么
Look what she made me do.

803
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,275
嗨
Hey.

804
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,756
艾德？
Ed?

805
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,155
看看她都让我干了些什么
Look what she made me do!

806
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,953
艾德！艾德！
Ed! Ed!

807
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,829
艾德！
Ed!

808
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,155
哥们儿，你还好吗？
Dude, you okay?

809
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,800
冷静点，布拉德，怎么了？
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

810
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,873
我看到了一个穿着佣人服的女人
I saw someone. There was a woman dressed as a maid.

811
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,517
艾德？艾德，有情况
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

812
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,634
是辛蒂，她在梦游  - 不，等等
It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.  - No, wait. We need this.

813
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,359
为什么要给辛蒂拍照？
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

814
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,834
不是她激发的
She didn't trigger it.

815
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,311
不是她激发的？什么意思？  - 有人跟她在一起
What do you mean she didn't trigger it?  - Somebody's with her.

816
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,630
谁？
Who?

817
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,914
辛蒂！
Cindy!

818
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,915
辛蒂！
Cindy!

819
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,080
辛蒂！
Cindy!

820
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,879
过来这里，这里安全
Hey, over here. It's safe.

821
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,918
有人跟她在一起
There's someone else in there with her.

822
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,510
我听到了另一个声音，这里，听
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

823
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,516
跟我来，这边走
Follow me. This way.

824
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,798
这就是我躲的地方
This is where I hide.

825
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,189
辛蒂？
Cindy?

826
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,040
辛蒂？
Cindy?

827
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,030
她去哪里了，艾德？
Where'd she go, Ed?

828
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,033
窗子都锁上了
Windows are locked.

829
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,037
艾德，她去哪里了？
Ed, where'd she go?

830
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,914
布拉德，把紫外灯拿来
Brad, get the UV light.

831
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,231
什么？  - 问德鲁
The what?  - Just ask Drew.

832
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,159
德鲁，我要个紫外灯
Drew, I need a UV light.

833
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,834
给，就这个，快去，快去！
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

834
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,914
关灯
Turn off the light.

835
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,119
让开
Get out of the way.

836
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,396
好的
Okay.

837
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,194
开灯！
Hit the lights!

838
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,760
找到她了
Found her.

839
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,436
过来吧
Here we go.

840
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,271
抱好了？  - 是的
All right. You got her?  - Yeah.

841
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,038
那就是罗利害怕的时候躲的地方
That's where Rory hides when he's afraid.

842
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,753
亲爱的？把艾普丽尔的音乐盒给我
Hon? Could I have April's music box, please?

843
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,560
辛蒂怎么样？  - 她什么都不记得
How's Cindy?  - She doesn't remember a thing.

844
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,840
给你
Here you go.

845
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,875
谢谢
Thank you.

846
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,874
罗琳！
Lorraine!

847
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,189
不
No.

848
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,309
罗琳！
Lorraine!

849
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,789
罗琳！
Lorraine!

850
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,560
罗琳！
Lorraine!

851
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,760
罗琳！
Lorraine!

852
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,640
是她让我这么做的
She made me do it.

853
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,280
是她让我这么做的
She made me do it.

854
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,600
是她让我这么做的
She made me do it.

855
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,356
艾德！
Ed!

856
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,358
拜托！罗琳！
Come on! Lorraine!

857
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,316
艾德！
Ed!

858
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,873
艾德，我知道她做了什么
Ed, I know what she did.

859
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,640
我扶你，我知道，没事了  - 我知道她做了什么
I got you. I know. It's okay.  - I know what she did.

860
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,713
我知道她做了什么，她附身在那妈妈身上杀了那孩子
I know what she did. She possessed the mother to kill the child.

861
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,394
她每晚都会去卡洛琳那里
She visits Carolyn every night.

862
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,394
所以才会有那些淤青！她在吸食她！
That's what the bruise marks are!She's feeding off of her!

863
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,079
呃…
Uh....

864
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,754
南希？
Nancy?

865
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,469
南希！
Nancy!

866
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,155
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

867
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,080
南希！
Nancy!

868
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,636
抓住她！
Grab her!

869
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,719
爸爸！救命！
Daddy! Help!

870
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,670
南希！
Nancy!

871
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,990
她还好吗？
Is she okay?

872
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,395
没事了，没事了
It's okay, I got you.

873
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,596
拍到了吗？
Did you get that?

874
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,075
是的
Yeah.

875
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,233
我去冲印胶片，然后拿给哥顿神父
I'll have the footage developed and get it over to Father Gordon.

876
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,394
他是我们教堂方面的联络人，我们会很快得到回应的
He's our liaison at the church.I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

877
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,597
听着，罗杰？  - 什么？
Listen, Roger?  - Yeah?

878
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,952
听着，我们接到驱魔人就会回来，但罗琳…
Listen, when we get the exorcist,I'll be back. But Lorraine--

879
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,192
是的，我明白  - 在这之前，德鲁会照看你们的
Yeah, I understand.  - Until then Drew's gonna keep an eye on you.

880
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,716
艾德，感谢你所做的一切  - 嗯
Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.  - Yeah.

881
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,435
妈咪？
Mommy?

882
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,399
就这些了
That's everything.

883
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,674
妈咪？
Mommy?

884
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,116
朱蒂？
Judy?

885
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,794
噢，上帝啊！
Oh, God!

886
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,076
朱蒂？
Judy?

887
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,672
罗琳！等等！
Lorraine! Wait!

888
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,794
罗琳，怎么了？
Lorraine. What?

889
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,314
妈妈，是我，朱蒂还好吗？
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

890
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,949
什么？  - 可以去看一下吗？
What?  - Can you go check, please?

891
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,193
该死的，妈妈，去看一下就是了！
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

892
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,194
可以告诉我到底怎么了吗？  - 是朱蒂
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?  - It's Judy.

893
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,874
什么？什么意思？
What? What do you mean?

894
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,996
什么意思？
What?

895
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,511
噢，谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

896
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,358
妈妈，对不起，我不是有意要吓你的，回头再跟你解释
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I'll explain later, okay?

897
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,320
这他妈到底怎么回事？
What the hell happened?

898
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,951
我看到朱蒂在湖里
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

899
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,396
我知道这是某种警告
I know it was some kind of warning.

900
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,120
我知道的
I know it.

901
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,509
好了
Okay.

902
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,880
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

903
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,349
然后？  - 嗯，你们不是开玩笑
So?  - Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

904
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,590
是的
No.

905
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,553
艾德，这事有点复杂，因为那些孩子们没有经过洗礼
Look, Ed, this is complicated because the kids aren't baptized.

906
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,952
是的，我理解  - 那家人也不是教会成员
No, I understand.  - And the family are not members of the church.

907
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,440
噢，拜托  - 还有…
Oh, come on.  - And....

908
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,751
许可令必须由梵蒂冈直接下发
The approval would have to come directly from the Vatican.

909
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,033
神父，我们从没见过这样的东西
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

910
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,640
是的，我也没见过
Yeah, well, neither have l.

911
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,238
神父，他们没那么多时间了
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

912
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,069
好吧
All right.

913
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,153
我会亲自跟进这事的
I'll push it through myself.

914
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,277
谢谢，神父，谢谢  - 谢谢
Thank you, Father. Thank you.  - Thank you.

915
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,753
我们等你电话  - 好的
All right, we'll wait for your call.  - Yeah.

916
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,711
妈妈？爸爸？
Mommy? Daddy?

917
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,560
妈妈？
Mommy?

918
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,400
爸爸？
Daddy?

919
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,594
爸爸？
Dad?

920
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,354
外婆？
Nanna?

921
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,000
外婆？
Nanna?

922
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,834
外婆！
Nanna!

923
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,839
外婆，救命！外婆，救命！
Nanna, help! Nanna, help!

924
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,036
朱蒂？
Judy?

925
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:50,558
外婆！
Nanna!

926
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,315
救命！
Help!

927
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,353
朱蒂！  - 外婆！
Judy!  - Nanna!

928
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,358
朱蒂，开门！  - 妈妈！
Judy, open the door!  - Mom!

929
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,352
艾德，有点不对劲  - 什么？
Ed, there's something wrong.  - What?

930
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,630
外婆！
Nanna!

931
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,873
朱蒂！  - 救命！
Judy!  - Help!

932
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,191
朱蒂！朱蒂，开门！  - 怎么了？
Judy! Judy, open this door!  - What is it?

933
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,478
她怎么了？朱蒂！  - 让开，让开，让开，让开
What's wrong with her? Judy!  - Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

934
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,273
朱蒂，退后，宝贝，退后
Judy, get back, honey. Get back!

935
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,154
拜托！  - 快点
Come on!  - Hurry.

936
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,792
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

937
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,079
离门远一点，朱蒂！
Get away from the door, Judy!

938
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,793
噢，上帝！你没事吧？
Oh, God! Are you okay?

939
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,034
有个人在跟安娜贝尔一起摇椅子
There was someone rocking in the chair with Annabelle.

940
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,236
什么？
What?

941
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,709
没事了
It's okay.

942
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,074
她还在箱子里
She's still in the case.

943
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,916
没事了
It's okay.

944
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,759
没事了，没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

945
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,670
爸爸！爸爸！  - 爸爸！
Dad! Dad!  - Daddy!

946
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,196
爸爸！爸爸！妈妈带着克里斯蒂和艾普丽尔走了
Dad! Dad! Mom just left with Christine and April.

947
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,795
她进了车子然后开走了，我不知道发生了什么事
She went in the car and drove away.I don't know what happened.

948
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,515
她闻起来有股烂肉味道  - 她没说到底是怎么了
She smells like rotting meat.  - She didn't say what was going on.

949
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,276
她走了是什么意思？走去哪了？  - 就是走了！不知道去哪里了
What do you mean, she left? Left where?  - Gone! I don't know where she was going.

950
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,359
我们去哪，妈妈？
Where are we going, Mom?

951
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,235
喂？  - 我是罗杰
Hello?  - It's Roger.

952
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,760
有事发生在卡洛琳身上了
Something's going on with Carolyn.

953
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,794
安德莉亚在，她说卡洛琳带着克里斯蒂和艾普丽尔走了
Andrea was here,said Carolyn took off with Christine and April.

954
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,714
孩子们说她闻起来像块烂肉  - 附身于母亲…
The girls said she smelled like rotten meat.  - Possesses the mother...

955
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,634
…来杀掉孩子，她就是这么做的，她要把她们带去那房子
...to kill the child, that's what she does.She's taking them to the house.

956
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,632
罗杰，现在去房子里，我在那跟你碰头
Roger, get back to the house now.I'll meet you there.

957
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,237
锁上门，拉上窗帘，远离电话
Lock the door, close the blinds.Stay off the phone!

958
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,595
走
Go.

959
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,713
我跟你一起去  - 不行，你陪着朱蒂
I'm coming with you.  - Noway, you stay with Judy.

960
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,310
保护朱蒂的唯一办法就是终结这一切
Only way to protect Judy is if we stop this where it started.

961
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,598
否则她会再次缠上我们  - 这正是我要去做的
Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.  - That's exactly why I am going.

962
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,395
你觉得我会让你一个人去吗？
You think I'm gonna let you walk into this alone?

963
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,400
我不能失去你
I can't lose you.

964
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,229
你不会的
You won't.

965
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,073
我们一起把这事终结吧
Let's finish this together.

966
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,594
锁上了  - 卡洛琳！
Agh! It's locked.  - Carolyn!

967
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,196
罗杰！
Roger!

968
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,476
让开！
Get out of the way!

969
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,359
罗杰！  - 艾德！
Roger!  - Ed!

970
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,113
卡洛琳！  - 艾德！
Carolyn!  - Ed!

971
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,555
卡洛琳！  - 我们在这里！
Carolyn!  - We're down here!

972
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,554
卡洛琳，不要！不，不！她抓着…！
Carolyn, don't!No, no! She's got...!

973
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,837
抓住她手！把剪刀夺下来！
Get her hand! Get the scissors!

974
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,436
我们得把她带到车里！  - 然后把她带去哪？
We gotta get her to the car!  - And bring her where?

975
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,597
把她带到神父那里驱魔
To take her to the priest for the exorcism.

976
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,154
艾普丽尔在哪？  - 艾普丽尔？
Where's April?  - April?

977
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,795
艾普丽尔！
April!

978
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,676
把克里斯蒂带上车，把艾普丽尔找出来！
Take Christine to the car and find April!

979
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,916
艾普丽尔！
April!

980
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,355
赶紧！
Come on!

981
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,751
她不让她离开这房子  - 什么意思？
She won't let her leave the house.  - What do you mean?

982
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,310
如果把她带出来，女巫会杀了她的
If we take her out, the witch will kill her.

983
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,674
罗杰！
Roger!

984
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,194
卡洛琳！
Carolyn!

985
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,596
快去！
Go!

986
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,830
卡洛琳！
Carolyn?

987
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,431
我把你放在这里，来
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.Come on.

988
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,240
进去，呆里面  - 我不想一个人在这里
Get in. Stay in here.  - I don't wanna stay here by myself.

989
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,198
呆在这里，我很快回来
Stay in here no matter what.I'll be back.

990
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,795
我要去找艾普丽尔，知道吗？很快回来，我发誓
I have to find April, okay?I'll be back, I promise.

991
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,910
艾普丽尔？
April?

992
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,109
你没事吧？
You okay?

993
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,269
住手！
Stop!

994
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,831
布拉德！布拉德！
Brad! Brad!

995
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,472
找点什么东西把她绑起来
Let's get something to tie her up!

996
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,434
按住
Hold it.

997
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,914
我得打电话把哥顿神父叫过来
I gotta call Father Gordon.We gotta get him out here.

998
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,436
他离的太远了，她撑不了那么久，看看她
He's too far away.She won't make it. Look at her.

999
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,515
那你得离开了  - 你在说什么？
Then you need to leave.  - What are you talking about?

1000
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,797
我得进行驱魔仪式
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1001
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,193
什么？你不是说需要一个神父吗，你又不是神父
What? I thought you said we need a priest. You're not a priest.

1002
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,835
你有更好的主意？  - 他可以的
Well, you got a better idea?  - He can do it.

1003
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,116
你可以的  - 但你得离开这里
You can do it.  - But you gotta get out of here.

1004
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,876
我不会离开你！  - 该死的，你不能在这里！
I'm not leaving you!  - Damn it, I'm not doing this with you in here!

1005
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,952
上帝把我们撮合在一起是有原因的，就这样
God brought us together for a reason.This is it.

1006
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,559
我去拿书
I'm gonna get the book.

1007
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,514
艾普丽尔！
April!

1008
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,754
艾普丽尔！
April!

1009
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,110
“以吾圣父，圣子，圣灵之名”
"In the name of the Father,the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1010
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,950
艾普丽尔！
April!

1011
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,951
按住她！按住她！

1012
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,873
过来！按住她！
Come here! Hold her still!

1013
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,949
艾普丽尔？
April?

1014
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,876
艾普丽尔！
April!

1015
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,599
艾普丽尔，你在下面吗？
April, you under there?

1016
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,070
艾普丽尔！
April!

1017
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:04,713
卡洛琳，卡洛琳，别放弃！别让她占有你！
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!Don't let her take you!

1018
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,957
艾德！不能再继续了，你会杀了她的，住手！
Ed! You gotta stop,you're killing her. Stop!

1020
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:13,320
罗杰，救我！
Roger, help me!

1021
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,232
艾德！该死的，住手！
Ed! Goddamn it, stop it!

1022
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,835
记住！我们是在为她的灵魂做斗争！
Understand this! We are now fighting for her soul!

1023
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,232
“以耶稣基督、圣人、天使之名…
"In the name of Jesus Christ,the saints and all the angels...

1024
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,511
…我命令你揭开你的真面目！”
...I command you to reveal yourself!"

1025
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,480
罗杰，救我！
Roger, help me!

1026
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,120
放她下来！
Put her down!

1027
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,275
放她下来！

01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,550
放她下来！
Put her down!

1029
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,635
卡洛琳！
Carolyn!

1030
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,155
卡洛琳！
Carolyn!

1031
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,991
艾德，小心！
Ed, look out!

1032
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,954
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1033
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,917
按住她！别让她再上去！
Hold her still! Don't let her up!

1034
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,480
她快不行了，罗杰！
We're losing her, Roger!

1035
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,195
去你的！离我家人远点，听到没有？
Damn you! You leave my family alone,you hear me?

1036
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,000
我不知道你是谁，但离我妻子远一点，该死的！
I don't know what you are, but you leave my wife alone, goddamn it!

1037
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:27,153
放开她！听到没？放开她！
Let her go!Do you hear me? Let her go!

1038
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,950
放开她，该死的！放开她！
Let her go, goddamn it! Let her go!

1039
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,471
她已经死了
She's already gone.

1040
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,317
现在你们都得死
And now you're all gonna die.

1041
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,870
艾普丽尔！
April!

1042
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,920
找到她了！她在下面！厨房下面！
I found her! She's under the house!Under the kitchen!

1043
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,510
不要！不！
Don't! No!

1044
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,680
抓住她！
Get her!

1045
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,514
给  - 卡洛琳！
Here.  - Carolyn!

1046
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,397
卡洛琳！  - 她在那洞里，就在那里
Carolyn!  - She's in that hole. Right there.

1047
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,117
卡洛琳？上帝啊，不！
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!

1048
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,000
进不去，够不到
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1049
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,669
不！卡洛琳，不要！
No! Carolyn, don't!

1050
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,400
卡洛琳，不要！
Carolyn, no!

1051
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,558
巴斯希巴！
Bathsheba!

1052
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,960
吾借上帝之力，命汝重回地狱！
By the power of God,I condemn you back to hell!

1053
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,920
这是你女儿！
This is your daughter!

1054
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,754
你不能屈服
You can't give in!

1055
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,151
罗杰，我们得让她自己反抗
Roger. We need to get her to fight from the inside.

1056
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,880
别让她这么做，别让那东西这么做！
Don't let her do this.Don't let this thing do this.

1057
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,271
你要反抗，我知道你比她更强
You gotta fight it.I know you're stronger than she is.

1058
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,318
你要跟它抗争！  - 继续，罗杰！
You gotta fight it!  - Keep it going, Roger!

1059
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,234
别离开我们，好吗？回来，卡洛琳！
You gotta stay with us, all right?Come on back, Carolyn!

1060
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,280
对了，就这样！带她回来！
You're in, that's it! Get her back!

1061
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:09,080
想一想你给我看的照片  - 不！
Remember what you showed me.  - No!

1062
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,469
想一想你说的那永世难忘的一天
Remember that day that you said you would never forget.

1063
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,556
你说他们就是你的一切
You said they meant the world to you.

1064
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,316
这些你都不要了吗？
This is what you'll be leaving behind.

1065
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,475
妈妈？
Mommy?

1066
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,200
都结束了
It's over.

1067
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,273
真对不起
I am so sorry.

1068
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:49,434
爱死你了，爱死你了
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1069
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,960
爱死你了
I love you so much.

1070
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,913
我太高兴了
I'm so happy.

1071
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,599
是风把你脸弄成这样的吗？
A draft do that to your face?

1072
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,471
我宁愿每天都面对持枪歹徒
I'd take a guy with a gun any day.

1073
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,194
你做的很好
You did good.

1074
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,040
不，你才是
No, you did.

1075
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,798
我打个电话给哥顿神父，告诉他这一切
I'll call Father Gordon and let him know what happened.

1076
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,279
听起来不错
